Bravo!","Date":"31 January 2001","Score":"60 out of 78 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama, History, War","Review":"  Having read all of the negative commentaries on this film, I would first like to point out that severely criticising the period of Soviet history in which Utoml'ennye Solntsem takes place, and in that effort, condemning the people of that era such as are portrayed in this film as being entirely culpable for their actions, is all very well and good to do from hindsight, and from the safety of a soft computer chair in the modern-day West.  Because of course, no one is tortured today in the West for a casual remark against the reigning despot; nor do we live under the threat that our families may be sent off to Siberia as one of the consequences of our actions, great or trivial.  I myself can't say what I would have been willing to do under the circumstances that existed during the time of the Soviet purges, whom I would have betrayed just to survive, or if I would have the courage to make some kind of moral, social, or political stand, and if I think I could have?  Well,if we all admit it to ourselves, we know that torture will break any man eventually...  In watching this film, I think that we should keep in mind that we are not necessarily here to judge but to take the director's journey to another time and place and yet we should still be able to remember and respect the fact that what we are seeing here is a piece of the history that lies beneath the modern day Russia.  This history is a shadow that has cast its pall over the lives of every Soviet citizen since then, including Mikhalkov.  The fear of the purges that swept over the Soviet Union during the 1930's and 40's is a kind of fear that will fade, but never die away entirely.  So, what can be the point in overly criticising Mikhalkov or any one in the former USSR for surviving under the system as it was before glasnost, knowing what they knew of the state and the full extent of what it could do and had already done (Stalin's purges may even have claimed 20-40 million lives)?  If Utoml'ennye Solntsem is Mikhalkov's attempt to exonerate his cooperation with the Soviet system within his own time, what has he really got to vindicate or to feel guilty about?  That being said, and despite the fact that numerous films, books, and media have copiously used this subject to tell a story, it is not a subject which can be exhausted but a rich treasure of unusual human experiences.  And, as some have pointed out, this film is far more than just a story of revolutionary politics or a tale of betrayal it IS a love story, between men and women, and between men and their motherland.  Moreover, I was sincerely moved by the love triangle between Marussya, Mitya, and Kotov.  Utoml'ennye Solntsem is not, however, a film that will make you laugh often, and would not at all were it not for the undeniable charm of the bold little Nadya.  Utoml'ennye Solntsem will make those who appreciate the tragic element within history, and in particular, this era of political turmoil, shed more than a few tears.  Because the truth lingers behind this tale, the truth of a time which was a nightmare few of us can imagine... or would want to.  In my opinion, the great thing about this film is that it throws us back for a while into that era and portrays what was good about it, what remains good, despite all obstacles; the film is a tale of love that survives the most extreme of human conditions.  It is fascinating and compelling, brave and tender, horrifying, and real.  Not for everyone, but certainly a masterpiece within its genre.

Of course, it is not surprising that it was made by Nikita Mikhalkov, one of the few Russian directors who achieved lasting world success during communism, and therefore he had the right contacts abroad to get a decent budget. Though, Burnt by the Sun is way better than Mikhalkov's pompous Barber of Siberia, which was alloted more money than any other film in the history of Russian cinema.In Burnt by the Sun, Mikhalkov was able to give us a palpable feeling of the beauty and genius of Russia. The lighting is magnificent all the way through, and the ripe and wide wheat fields shine like gold. The action takes place in a cozy dacha among the birch trees, a house which seems to be the nest of a bunch of gentle and carefree eccentrics, all in an atmosphere that reminds pleasantly of Tchekov. Yet, you can tell from the start that Burnt by the Sun is not going to be just a comedy, as the first scene opens on a man cutting his veins in a bathtub while the telephone is ringing. However, this first forewarning soon gets forgotten throughout most of the film, which keeps a warm, light-hearted, slightly nostalgic tone almost all the time. It is only towards the middle you realize that it starts looming slowly towards predictable tragedy, and this only gets obvious in the very last moments.It turns out that the characters we see are all members of an old aristocratic family who were spared the horrors of the revolution because the younger daughter, Marusia, married a Red Army colonel, much older than she is. Thus, they keep on living as they ever did, playing cards, drinking tea from samovars, making private jokes in French. They even have a maid and a parrot. They seem totally oblivious of the reality around them. Except for innocent looking balloons with Stalin's face on them and a few parading pioneers, the communist regime is visible almost only through the presence of colonel Kotov, brilliantly played here by Nikita Mikhalkov himself.Colonel Kotov impersonates a character very familiar to the Russian mentality  he is tall, strong, authoritarian, but at the same time protective, warm-hearted, charming and prone to jokes. He is about just as sympathetic as the gruff milkman with a heart of gold in Fiddler on the Roof. Although he is a military, he is not the kind of guy you think as having blood on his hands. But of course Lenin and Stalin's aura over Russian people was also partly due to the fact that they represented strong and protective father figures.The story takes a sudden turn with the arrival of an enigmatic character disguised as a Santa Claus in the middle of summer. He turns out to be known by everyone in the house, as he is the adoptive child of the late grandfather. In fact, he was Marusia's childhood companion, and her lover in the first place, but was evicted by Kotov, who protected henceforth the whole family from repression. It soon becomes clear that the man, called Mitya, has come to take revenge for his shattered life.All performances here are good, even though Nikita Mikhalkov, as an actor, still manages to steal the show. But one will not either forget the performance of his then six-year old daughter Nadya , who also plays his daughter in the movie. A charming, energetic and witty child performance which impersonates the innocence of the family about to be lost.The French title for the movie was Deceitful Sun, and I find it more appropriate. Although the film bathes in quiet sunlight, it deals with one of the darkest eras of Russian/Soviet history  Stalinism. In the early 1930's, Stalin decided to eliminate much of the newly arisen communist elite whom he did not trust anymore, and hired former enemies of communism, or half-criminals, to eradicate his own official allies. Thus, colonel Kotov remains self-righteous and sure of himself almost until the end because he simply cannot believe that Stalin will not protect him. Needless to say that Burnt by the Sun is one of the first Russian movies that deals so openly with the subject. A subject which still remains quite sensitive since millions of people had their lives shattered by those events. Unlike what happened for Nazism, it was not until the end of the communist regime that it was possible to discuss it openly, even though Stalin's deeds had already been condemned officially a long time before. Therefore, this superb drama is also the symbol of a historical breakthrough.

To hear that The Barber of Siberia is a stupid sentimental movie is quite common nowadays. But the more time passes from his next in turn production, the more a strange effect seems to take place his films at last are rated according to their true value and not to somebody's opinion about them. It is always hard to say that something new is really good, but some time later...Utoml'ennye Solntsem is not a very emotional movie. I don't suppose you'd cry when watching it. But my opinion is that it's a brilliant one. It is historically authentic (I've studied that period of time quite carefully so I think I have a right to say so). And no-one on this site seems to notice the love story in the film, which actually brought about the whole tragedy (remember, Kotov made Mitya work for NKVD). It was marvellously played by Oleg Men'shikov (my favourite actor) and Ingeborga Dapkunaite, a remarkable Lithuanian actress. And Mikhalkov himself, of course - Kot means cat, by the way. Many people endow him with the characteristics of Kotov which only shows that he played his role well. A good actor is always attributed his character's traits.But still, for me the main feature of the film is the world of Mitya's soul created by Men'shikov. A young, talented boy with brilliant prospects is what Mitya was. He gets involved in the war, goes through many ordeals, then comes home and falls in love with the girl he knew from her very birth, Marousya. But their happiness is too short. He is given a choice to work for NKVD or...to commit suicide. He's only 24, and he wants to live. But hope for future slowly disappears as life goes on, cruel and senseless. When Mitya appears on the dacha of Marousya's parents, his soul is almost a wreck. But the last chance is killed when he sees that, after a suicide attempt, after months of despair, Marousya has married Kotov and doesn't want to go through everything again. Therefore Mitya begins to fulfill his revenge.

This is when our life is determined by external forces. Even the most basic form of happiness - being with you family, enjoying your child - were impossible in the Russia of Stalin. Sometimes I think about people who were borne 20 years before World War II in Germany, Poland or Russia. I wonder whether they had a feeling that the life was extremely unfair to them. The feeling that your fate was determined by the time you were borne in, and that you couldn't do anything at all to somehow change it. If Mitya, Kotov and Marusya would not die then, they would have to wait for 50 years to be able to truly understand what happened to them and who was to blame for it.I was puzzled why Mitya picked up the phone and agreed to arrest Kotov. Why didn't he stop his suffering immediately, as he knew that he had no other option than ruining lives of the people he loved. Was it his hatred towards Kotov and the opportunity to take revenge for being expelled for 10 years? Was it the last hope that his love to Marusya would reverse her marriage?After watched the film again & again I decided that he knew from the offset there was no way out. Mitya went to his old home because he wanted just one thing - to say farewell to his dream that the old times would ever return. The dream that made him betray his comrades in the 20th, and come back from France in the 30th.I'm so happy that we live in freedom and that the iron curtain fell.

Mikhalkov's filming of a superficially ugly Russia is lyrical and emotionally charged, and his own performance is like watching an oak tree being systematically hacked, sublime in its reach.

Each of the complex characters is portrayed in detail and with affection by director Mikhalkov. The Red Army hero, Kotov, starts the film as a braggart, chasing away Soviet tanks from his local village. We then see him as a loving husband and a devoted father, living a pre-revolutionary rustic life in his dacha. But further less appealing character facets emerge as the film develops. His wife, her family and their six-year old daughter Nadia (a triumphant performance) reveal their hopes and fears, and come over as a very real family, with foibles and a past which shapes their present. The intrusion of Dmitri after ten years away at first adds to this rural idyll, until the dark truth slowly is revealed - although the opening sequence, when he is seen playing Russian roulette, hints that all is not as well as the glowing landscapes and happy peasants might imply.The end is shocking, but at the same time almost comic, as Stalin and Stalinism intrude brutally into the peaceful countryside. But there is a sense of completion and of a tale well told as the final credits indicate the fate of the main characters. Mikhalkov is a master story-teller, and this is one of the great films of the 1990s, and a Russian masterpiece.

It details the arrest of a Russian Civil War veteran, Sergei Petrovich Kotov.At 135 minutes, some will say that the movie runs long but I disagree. While the plot does not really begin until the second half, the extra time is not wasted on viewers. We see much of Kotov, his family, and are made that much more sad when his fate is revealed.The characters are all incredibly interesting and well-developed. We learn much about Kotov, Nadya, and Mitya. The latter is especially interesting. We can see immediately that there is something wrong with Mitya and do not trust him. Then, when he and Kotov pretend to be friends around Nadya, we begin to feel he is not that bad of a character, and that the movie might end well (I did, at least). But finally, when he kills the lost farmer and salutes the image of Stalin (one of my favorite moments), we realize Mitya is gone.However, given everything that the film does to show cruelty, I was surprised by how tame it made certain scenes. The lost farmer is shot off screen, as is Kotov death. At first glance, this seems unnecessary. Why not show their deaths in full force? In the end though, I think the director made the right decision. There are some scenes that, no matter how powerful they are, will not live up to people's expectations. It was better to leave these moments off-screen so that the audience can imagine them as they see fit. It seems like these scenes are only revealed to the viewer when there was no other choice (like the balloon carrying the image of Stalin). This way, the movie tells as much of the story as it has to and leaves the rest to the audience. I enjoyed it.

Kotov's dacha, remnant of a pre-Soviet age, is filled with light, billowing curtains and good-natured Chekhovian comings and goings. All is well with the world, even as detachments of the Red Army perform clownish manoevres in the wheatfields. Except that this is 1936, and Uncle Joe has a few nasty surprises in store. For all the golden backlighting (staple of Soviet-export art cinema of the 70s and 80s), this day in the country is not going to end well for the old soldier.Lauded in the West on its release in the heady mid-90s, this is, in truth, a deeply flawed and thinly veiled apologia for Mikhalkov's former complicity with the Communist regime. He does not merely sympathise with the beguiled Kotov. He literally identifies with a character imbued, for good measure, with every honest manly virtue. In a scene of genuine tenderness, Kotov drifts downriver with his young daughter (sparklingly played by the actor/director's own child), extolling the promise of the socialist future. The ironies here are truly double-edged. Kotov's elegy is Mikhalkov's confused self-exculpation. The vision was a noble one. The Old Bolsheviks meant well. (Never mind that, in reality, Dzerzhinsky's torturers were busy from day one.) It was Stalin's Terror that ruined it all. You mustn't tar every Party member with the same brush.So an unwholesome air of self-justification, self-delusion and self-pity pervades the film, despite - or rather, precisely because of - its claims to truthfulness (manifested in the shockingly brutal ending, however manipulative) and its unfailing (and deadening) tastefulness. Mikhalkov merely exchanges the orthodoxies of the Brezhnev/Andropov era for those of Glasnost - itself (unfortunately for so practised a time-server) already old hat by 1994. In the good old days, the director was a leading exponent of the Soviet Union's answer to Merchant Ivory, purveying easy-on-the-eye pre-1917 languor (never forgetting - lest anyone should get the wrong idea - to point up the decadence). He serves up much the same dish here, spiced with some safe historical critique and a twist of something extra. The flip side of the film's Russophilia (Kotov's easy earthiness; all that wheat) is a curious xenophobia (cosmopolitan Mitya is NKVD). The odd result is that Stalin's supposed betrayal of the Leninist ideal is insidiously equated with the alien, the intellectual and the bourgeois. Kotov swears like a trooper, enjoys a game of soccer and playfully gooses the maid; whereas Judas Mitya quotes Shakespeare in the original, plays Chopin rather well and converses with his manservant in polished French.It is, of course, grossly unfair to mention in this context that Mikhalkov's father penned the USSR's national anthem. But then again - in the light of this film's insidious special pleading, and its disquieting taint of moral and historical dishonesty - it is hard to resist doing so.

The first section, in particular, meanders for no reason. Mikhalkov is trying for a Checkovian mood, but all we get is a tired romantic triangle with a very obvious resolution. The second section, more political, is stronger, but occurs way too late in the film. The end is again very obvious and expected. To the last minute I hoped to be surprised, and was thoroughly disappointed. One can guess the events in this film literally 15 minutes before they happen.I usually enjoy certain films with slow or deliberate rhythm, if they have artistic meaning, great style or emotional storyline. Burnt By The Sun is beautifully photographed, in that Eastern European idyllic style. Otherwise, it seemed to me empty like the hot air balloon with Stalin's image that features at the end. Full of obvious symbolism senseless parables, with characters drawn too broadly to keep us interested. Many reviewers have remarked on the touching scenes between Mikhalov and his daughter. These are strong scenes, but unfortunately they are the only touching scenes in this very long film. You wish the movie could have focused more on this relationship and less on the extended family and the political parable.This must have been a labor of love for Mikhalkov, who acted, wrote, directed and featured his own child in the movie. When Pulp Fiction received the Palm D'Or at the Cannes Film Festival, instead of Burnt By The Sun, Mikhalkov was incensed, and commented about Masterpieces being overlooked. I am sorry to report that this movie is no Masterpiece. It is a boring, slow paced, uninteresting film that goes on too long. At least for this viewer.

It's a decent film, basically sentimental (like The Pianist) though nothing to rave about. The General's tender relationship with his wife and child, with which we are beaten around the head for a couple of hours, is far less interesting than the almost shocking idea of post-revolutionary Russia in shimmering colour, where the sun still shines and people still picnic by the river - looking nothing at all like Eisenstein et al had it.Apparently, folks still hung out at the dacha in those days, and here we have the usual genteel bunch in white flannels as if transplanted from a Bergman film. Mikhalkov wants us to know and like them all, but the film would be leaner and better without the extra baggage. Plenty of scenes are vaguely unsatisfactory, like a joke told by someone you don't like. There is a fireball motif which doesn't work at all. But the real problem is that all the scene-setting means two hours of beating around the bush (literally, in some scenes), in order to set up the powerful and moving final ten minutes, which has beating of another kind, and which appears to come straight out of the Coen brothers.

He believes he is participating to the building of a great new Russia, by actively supporting a new regime communism. Like many of the original idealists who believed communism was the answer to a society plagued by severe income disparity, a large impoverished population, and a decaying aristocracy, he turned a blind eye when injustice and cruelty became the tools for building the great motherland, and people were abused and killed in the name of The People. In his blind credulity, he thinks he has achieved the position and power he holds through good, honest work, and he actually believes the patriotic slogans and mantras used by Stalin's regime to pummel the population into communist indoctrination. Since his life is good, he has no reason to think the regime is wrong.Enter Dimitri, a self-loathing informer. His work gets other people killed, or destroys their lives. He does it to avoid death, life in a Siberian gulag, or some other horrible fate. What he does goes against everything he stands for, but, as we learn, he believed that by cooperating he would redeem himself in the eyes of the authorities (as an aristocrat he was automatically considered an enemy, guilty of existing) and would be allowed to go back to his life and the woman he loved. Once he realizes there is no way out, and that his sweetheart (Marusia) abandoned him by marrying Kotov, the man whom he holds responsible for his miserable fate, he loses hope. His psychological death complete, all he has left is to commit his physical one. Yet, there's one more thing keeping Dimitri alive his quest for revenge. He wanted to show Marusia how wrong she was to give up on him, and to destroy Kotov and force him to face himself and the monstrous world he helped build. Dimitri's position as a highly regarded informer provided him with the chance of giving Kotov (a man who once was friends with Stalin himself and unaware that he was now quickly falling out of grace with the fickle leader) the final blow. Dimitri's quest for revenge allows him no scruples about what his actions would do to others, like little Nadya, or her mother Marusia whom he loved and who was only a victim of Kotov's deceit. In the end, Dimitri's suffering turned him from victim into monster this time he doesn't do the job only because he has to, but because he wants to do it, and, in the process, he is willing to hurt innocent people.Besides the artistic excellence of this film, what is amazing is its capability of presenting the multifaceted aspects of human nature, good and bad intertwined with all the gray areas, and how blind faith and deep suffering can destroy someone and ruin a world. Among many other things, this film is a great character study; it depicts two could have been decent men who became monsters, one blinded by his beliefs, the other tortured into it. They are both victims of the world they were a part of, both burnt by the sun of the revolution. As the conflict between Kotov, Dimitri and Marusia develops, we watch it intertwined with regular life - people working, loving, playing, believing in ethics, morals, truth, the future. I think this is a film that talks about how a totalitarian regime is built not only through lies, terror and coercion, but also by silence, half truths, compromise and complacency. It is a memento for any society, communist or otherwise.There is a moment in the film, after Kotov is arrested by the NKVD, as a result of Dimitri's informing, when Kotov is convinced that once his detainers realize who he was they would release him with apologies, but he soon discovers how wrong he was. As he endures the humiliation and beating in the car, he slowly understands the reality of the world he helped building. He begins to weep, then sob, and one can almost see what goes through his mind shock, regret, shame, despair.My comments only scratch the surface of this piece of great cinema. It would take many pages to do this film justice. The screenplay, the acting, the incredible cinematography, the masterful directing of every frame, all crafted this film into a masterpiece.

Nikita Mikhalkov exemplifies Stalin's reign as a force of terror that destroys all facets of life. The scene is set in the middle 1930s with a seemingly happy family under Stalin's rule. Sergie Kotov is a retired war hero and a very respected man amongst his village peers. Along with Kotov's (nearly) likable character, the movie also followed around a bright orb (sun) that ruined (burned) everything it came near. This orb became a clear metaphor for Stalin's rule. Nikita Mikhalkov's film was released in 1994 but the premise is in the heart of Joseph Stalin's tenure. Literature and movie censorship was at an all-time high during the Stalin era. Russians that made images that negatively portrayed communist Russia were banned all together. Even a film that featured Gary Oldman and Tom Hardy recently (April 2015) was forced to stop production because of negative publicity about the Stalin days. Even though this film does not directly point to Stalin's paranoia there is no mistaking the distaste Mikhalkov had for this time period. This writer enjoyed how Kotov was built up through the storyline. To the everyday civilian, Kotov was very respected but not feared. Not feared in a sense that a nearby villager can interrupt Kotov's day off in order to protect the villages' interests. On the other hand, his wife might hate him but I hear that is a rather common thing nowadays. All in all, the audience could see Kotov as the general 'good guy' of the picture. Kotov was enamored with mother Russia. One could decipher from the dialect that Kotov was a loyalist to his country. Pictures of Kotov and Stalin proudly placed within his home as well as having a personal line directly to Stalin. But his loyalty and years of dedication could not protect Kotov from Stalin.A golden orb was seen thrashing and destroying everything in its path for the duration of the film. The orb is thought to be Stalin's power that stretches as far as the sun can reach. The fireball can be seen traveling from scene to scene; once it came inside a home and destroyed a picture frame (family), a random tree (maybe the environment around you), and even Mitia (oneself). The best characters in the picture were Mitia and Nadia. Mitia was a hot and cold type of character. He was either the most animated character or the most depressing. On the other hand, Nadia stole the show. Nadia brought a liveliness that cannot be matched. It was definitely one of the best child performances on the big screen. Overall, Mikhalkov view on life in the mid 1930s was eye opening and informative. This slow paced film might have been in trouble if it weren't for Nadia's performance.

They both have a claim on Marusya (Ingeborg Dapkunaite) Srgey is married to her, and Dmitriy was a former lover of hers. It seems that the film's moral scheme is relatively straightforward Dmitriy is talented but feckless, while Sergey seems virtually untouchable - not only does he have a great career, but he is happily married as well. However director Mikhailkov turns the tables on our expectations and thereby transforms BURNT BY THE SUN into a penetrating analysis of how dictatorships corrupt everyone around them. Concepts of 'good' and 'evil# no longer prevail everyone simply does what it takes in order to survive. The ending is both shocking yet predictable. Visually speaking, the film contrasts the idyllic surroundings of Dmitriy's dacha with the behavior of the protagonists - it seems that no one can actively enjoy the delights of glorious summer weather, for fear of being discovered. Life at that time must have been precarious, with no one actually being sure as to what would happen to them next.

Burnt focuses on Russia in 1936, just before the Great Purge. This movie isn't as funny as the beginning of Life Is Beautiful, but some whimsical discussion is heard of summer Santas and wizards; there's piano playing with a gas mask; there's a question about leaving the zoo. But this is a mostly serious movie. It shows a very close relationship between a Russian colonel, Kotov, and his young daughter Nadya. Then it bluntly shows Kotov being arrested, torn from her life. In this way, Burnt by the Sun reveals the human tragedy of Stalin's paranoia and purges.There's more- though Kotov is a man destroyed by the Soviet Union, the unfortunate irony is that he was actually a patriotic and loyal Soviet. The scene where he and his daughter are on a boat underlines that fact, and makes what happens later look tragically needless.I first saw this gem in a university class on the Soviet Union. It came with a disclaimer from the professor that sending people to summer homes of Stalin's victims was not the way the Purges were really done. Like Life Is Beautiful, we have to bend realism a bit, but it's worth it. I'm not sure if this movie needed the mysterious orb of light; when I saw it hovering over a field, I asked my professor if it was going to make a crop circle. Actually it was just symbolism. The ball of light and the sun mentioned in the title are the Russian Revolution, and this movie is about people burnt by it. Equating the Revolution to something warm and bright makes me wonder if the Revolution is seen in this movie as a mostly good thing; but this movie shows there were also negative consequences. Orb of light or no orb of light, this movie is still memorable and wonderful.

Dimitri's and Marusia's love is ruined by Col Kotov, who gives Dimitri two choices- working for the government or die- what a love triangle.As the ending statements tell the fate of Col Kotov, his wife and daughter, we see little Nadya runs freely in the field, which is an extremely poignant scene- as Nadya, Nadezhda Mikhalkova delivered an absolutely impressive performance at such a tender age.

Well acted, it showed how normal life, even for a hero, could continue in a state we, in the West, knew little about. The scene where Dmitri is playing French can-can music, to Sergei's annoyance as it was bourgeois, and not Russian, struck me as showing the nationalistic devotion of the society known as Old Bolsheviks. Learning more about the Terror, we realize how people like Totov were at risk; even Lenin's widow Nadzedah Krupsankya was at risk of receiving Stalin's ire.

For more than first half of the movie we see a highly decorated Russian officer in his summer house with his family spending his day off in bath, beaches, playing football, dancing. During this time, an unexpected guest arrive in the house but then soon we know who he is and how he is connected to this house (although we don't know why he is there) and we again are lost in a lazy summer day in Russia listening to stories, songs, dancing. Then as we move on story starts to unfold before us and we are for a shock, especially last ten minutes, which for me, was one of the most powerful and harsh realization of history on cinema ever. It completely took me off guard after watching movie till that point, although there was this element that something is gonna happen, but I by no means expected this. As a viewer, I was lost for most part with so much peace around and little interference of the government in the movie that I forget not just what period it is set in, but the place too, as we are use to seeing the kind of Russian life during revolution and war times which is nothing but tragic. I guess movie did it part in not just portraying troubled soviet history but very convincingly showed us that even though people might have done bad deeds but during those period it was safe that way for them and their family. For them it was all about survival,living was secondary, but I can only guess as in current time I don't have to worry about survival but I worry about living. I sincerely salute every soul who lived through that sad period of history.Acting wise all actors were good but I must admit the little Nadya was amazing as the daughter of Nikita Mikhalkov colonel's daughter (she is his real life daughter) and she impresses us with her innocence, cuteness and boldness at times with elders (not rudeness, its just innocence of a child) throughout the movie. The scenes between Nadya and her father are one of the best aspects of the movie. Direction is top class. Music suits to the mood of the movie. Highly Recommended!!

It won an Oscar and a runner-up in Cannes. It fascinated the Russian audience and it ended up on cinema screens of tens of countries. Whatsmore it caused conflicts and arguments like no other Russian film in the 90's.The chosen point of view is actually surprising itself. It is the summer of 1936. Terror of Stalin is gathering a plentiful harvest. Meanwhile, we fill with the taste of the idyllic country life in an old aristocratic nest. Today it is a Moscow house of a legendary hero of the civil war - colonel of the Soviet Army Kotov (played dashingly by the director himself). The plebeian, loyal the Stalin and the tenet, lives here with a younger wife Marusia (Ingeborga Dapkunaite), her relatives from an aristocratic, professor family that melancholicly look back at the aroma of the older days before the revolution, and his beloved sic-year-old daughter Nadia (Nadia Michałkowa, the daughter of Nikita. The lazy days fly. The are filled with baths in the river, voyages with a boat, walks near the fields of grown wheat, talks and little argues at the table covered with taste. To this sanctuary hidden under the wings of the impudent comrade Kotov's authority suddenly comes Mitia (Oleg Mieńszykow). He's Marusia's old love. A talented pianist and an ex white emigrant. Suddennly the facts from the past are uncovering. Family secrets. Deeply hidden feelings. And we're almost ready to accept a love story with a classical marriage triangle. But Michałkow prepares us another, most important surprise. The comfort and calmness of this world's life turn out to be a naive illusion in that surprise's sinister light. Innocent gestures, behaviors and foolishnesses turn out to be a grim masquerade. The aura of a holiday carelessness gives place for tragedy.The director tell all of this very suggestively, with a lot of liberty and talent, with plastically taste and taking care of every detail. He perfectly associate Czechov's auras with the grotesque of the Soviet customs and rituals. He unites the ironic distance with the lyricism of his own memories from childhood. Memories from his house where his mother, a writer and a translator tried to develop the spiritual traditions of the Russian intelligence under a shielding umbrella of his father, a story-writer and a political worker, the author of the Stalinian anthem of the Soviet Union. In Russia it was said about Kotov that he was neither Frunze nor Tuchaczewski. The origin of Mitia was assigned to Siergiej Efron who was the husband of the poet, Marina Cwietajewa. Michałkov assured that all characters are made up except for Katia Mochowa who was a reproduction of his mother's faithful servant. The cold analysis of the film led the critics to a statement that the director idealizes Kotov by hiding his own work from the 20's. He never gives information about Kotov's dedication to the terror of which he has been one of the creators. There is a lot of truth in there, but the film is not a historical debate. He doesn't say who is good or who should be forsaken (the phrases from the film state we were all guilty or can you forsake people whose faith, hope and love were stolen?). He tries to catch a single situation from a summer of 1936. The situation from a very well-known house. He neither gives a prologue to that situation nor he is building his characters' life backwards. Those empty spaces of the characters' life are left for the audience to think about. The symbolic meaning of the round thunder that crawls around the house being a untouchable witness of the happenings is also left for the audience's imagination.

Directed and starring Nikita Mikhalkov who also co-wrote the screenplay with Rustam Ibragimbekov, this film allows us entry into the inside stories of Russia under Stalin. It is an emotionally devastating tale.On the grounds of his dacha in 1936 revolutionary hero Colonel Kotov (Nikita Mikhalkov) cavorts in his sauna with his young daughter Nadya (Nadezhda Mikhalkova) and his elegantly beautiful young wife Marusia (Ingeborga Dapkunaite). Outside on the lawn is the rest of Kotov's family in a peaceful, sun-drenched summer garden, drinking, singing, and blissfully enjoying life in the country. On the vast horizon is a group of men assembling a balloon to honor Stalin, and a group of army tanks treads onto the wheat fields threatening to destroy the crops. The townsfolk workers run for Kotov to rescue the situation, underlining the fact the Kotov is their hero from the revolution, much loved and respected. Abruptly onto the scene comes the handsome young cousin Dimitri/Mitya (Oleg Menshikov), an ex-lover of Kotov's wife. He ingratiates himself with Nadia and the rest of the family as a pianist and singer, but there is a note of evil lurking. Kotov understands the threat that Mitya's arrival indicates, that he has been betrayed and has become one of the many to be purged by Stalin. But the life in the dacha remains leisurely and elegant until the fateful end when Mitya's mission is fulfilled. The film ends with phrases telling us about the destinies of Kotov and his family up to the end of the purge after Stalin's death.The story is history the telling is art. Blest with a cast of extraordinary luminosity, Nikita Mikhalkov directs this tale of repression with style and leisurely pacing, such as allowing for moments at table when one of the grandmothers sings an aria from Puccini's 'Madama Butterfly', an aria whose text foreshadows the future of the story. It is this contrast between the residual classy elegance of Russia before the revolution and the gritty reality of the cruelty of Stalinism that makes the film so resonant. The cinematography by Vilen Kalyuta and the musical score by Eduard Artemyev enhance the film immeasurably. In Russian and French with English subtitles. Highly Recommended.

I have no problem with character development, but this has far too many roles for us to remember even half of them, and it doesn't seem like it's important, other than to emphasize that they are, well, all there, and all in a good mood. And this has a lot of noise, with singing, cheering and in general, you can hear something much of the time. This is filmed well, and the acting tends to be convincing. It shows what it was like back then, if it is a tad, well, covered in a sugary glaze considering what it's about. Charm? Sure. This does have occasional compelling imagery, as well. I suppose that this is like other movies from France, but I know that they can look straight in the eye of something negative, also, and I think it would have fit better to do so here, as well.

One day, Marusia's ex lover Mitya (Oleg Menshikov) arrives at the dacha, apparently for a visit. This guy knows how to charm everyone, which he certainly does here. But as he stays, Sergei not only becomes jealous of him, but it becomes clear that he didn't come just to be social it's the era of Stalin's purges, and Mitya is working for the NKVD, the Soviet secret police.In my class Twentieth Century Russian Literature & Film here in Lewis & Clark College, we ask some questions about the movies that we watch (who wins? who loses? who dies? who is happy?). Here, there are two possibilities for the winner it could be Stalin, just because he's so successful at mass genocide and his picture gets gloriously carried around by the balloon; or it could be Nadya, because the message at the end identifies that she eventually got exonerated (and, let's face it, Stalin is long since discredited). I would say that Kotov loses he acts on his beliefs - like when he stops the tanks from destroying the field - which get betrayed by Stalin. Many people die Marusia is betrayed, the truck driver is in the wrong place at the wrong time, and Mitya feels guilty (he's not cynical enough to live on). Nadya is clearly happy a naive, adored six-year-old, she gets anything that she wants (she even gets to drive), although she will eventually have to learn the ugly truth about everything.All in all, this is truly a masterpiece. As the end makes clear, it is dedicated to all who were burnt by the sun of revolution (the movie even features what looks like a miniature sun going around burning things).It's also come to my attention that they're making a sequel to this. I try to imagine how they would continue the story; maybe it features Nadya going all Rambo on Stalin. Just kidding, I'm sure that it doesn't have that. But I will be eager to see it.

Mikhalkova was also wonderful to watch as the young girl, innocent and sweet, yet curious and smart.

During the purges, Stalin eliminated hundreds of his best men in the military, which is probably why the Russian military is as bad as it is now from the Afghan War in the eighties to the wars in Chechnya. So the film accounts how great Kotov is as a military leader and how he bonds with his family. In addition, his wife Marusia had a love affair with a man by the name of Dmitri prior to meeting Kotov. As such, Dimitri visits the family, because he will be the one that implements the purge of Kotov and the family. For the purges didn't stop at the individual, but the whole family was purged. As a result of Dmitri's actions he takes his own life at the end of the film. In the end, the film is very telling of the emotions that are played out during the Great Purges and it had good acting as well.

This film is unusual in that it really only centers on a TINY portion of the horror--in this case a beloved hero of the 1917 revolution and his family. He is a paragon of the community and seems to be a decent man down deep and he has a lovely family (though I was a bit confused by his relationship with his young wife--this was the only poorly written portion of the movie). The film begins with the family on vacation in their Dacha, when, unexpectedly, an old boyfriend from the wife's past shows. He is a charming and talented musical entertainer and much of the film then centers on his relationship with the daughter (who looks about 7 years-old). Where the film goes from there and the betrayals and tragedies I won't describe--it would spoil the film. However, it is important to note that you'll come to really care about the characters and their fates.

It's over two hours long and almost nothing happens, plus most of the characters are just downright stupid.Basically, it's the story about the life of a common man under the totalitarianism regime of Stalin. Even describing it is boring! Hey, this isn't something we have to watch in a classroom it's supposed to be entertainment and this is about as entertaining as Stalin himself.

Some truths below...","Date":"4 November 2007","Score":"8 out of 36 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama, History, War","Review":" Taken that you know nothing of Soviet history you'll easily believe everything you see in the movie. BUT someone who has a better knowledge of the situation can get some things straight. 1.The purges were what? Anyone who'd speak in opposition to the regime would be imprisoned, executed, e.t.c.? WRONG! Anyone who was proved to act against the people's benefit and interest was taken in. And that included a)Government officers who were abusing their power, or not serving the people as they should b)Counter-revolutionists. You won't believe me, but there were many. Since 1922 when the soviet regime replaced the tsarist regime. The very reason that NKVD existed was for uprooting the counter-revolutionists, who were acting exactly like terrorist groups. c)Former tsarist officers and familiars. They were given the choice to live as the rest of the people. Most chose not to and cowardly left the country. Some others stayed in the country and in secrecy became spies to the western bourgeois. A small minority of them gave up on land and power and became part of the peopleTo be accurate, during the first semester of 1937 when the purge began, there were many innocent people falsely accused and ended up imprisoned or executed. And don't haste to blame the insane dictator Stalin for that. In most cases it went like this the local commissars included in the lists people they had personal differences with, the only member of the Central Commitee of the Party being aware of that being none other than Nikita Khruschev, who had been undermining Stalin from the beginning, and was cunning enough for his deeds to escape Stalin's attention. Letters of complains regarding arrests of innocents were being sent to the Party HQ, none of them to reach Stalin himself (again, Khruschev responsible for that). Until one letter was sent to Stalin himself. Stalin took action himself. The kept letters were found and the local officers were imprisoned in place of the innocent ones who were lucky to escape execution. When Stalin passed away Khruschev came to power and replaced the government officers with his own trusting people, who forcefully took out of prison especially for that cause. The fall of USSR had just began...That's something you'd never learn from your information sources and media. Bourgeois like those that rule the countries you live were never more afraid of the ones who established a worker's regime. During the Lenin and Stalin era the soviet people became educated, was receiving medication to the maximum availability point (the medicines available then were extremely fewer in comparison with today), had food and were being paid well. During Stalin the people's expectations took form. Take the extremely diligent preparation for the WW2 and you'll understand why Stalin was a fatherly figure to the soviet people. In short, yes, you have been taught almost nothing but lies regarding Stalin. And that movie does nothing more that showing the world what the ones who can afford that kind of propaganda think about Stalin. Do not make the mistake to consider their opinion as historical facts.I'm accepting emails if anyone wants to discuss anything about it "}]
