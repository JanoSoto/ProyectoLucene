The story is told in a way only a European can, you would never find such a movie in Hollywood. There are no special effects, no gadgets, no fast cars, ... nothing you would probably find in it if this was a Hollywood production. The characters are the real stars in this movie, together with all the streets and canals of Venice. It's about a middle aged, neglected housewife and mother who is left behind by her family on a bus trip. Her family doesn't even notice she's missing until two hours later. She decides to hitch-hike home and she meets different people. To one of them she says that she has never been to Venice, but that she really would like to see it. The man suggests to bring her to Venice instead of driving her home and so her adventure begins. She meets some interesting people and in one way or another she always influences their lives. But not only their lives change, her life is influenced by it as well. I guess this must sound incredibly boring to some people, but it really isn't. I enjoyed the movie - which can be seen as a modern fairy tale or as a real story - a lot. I guess it all depends from the viewer. Do you believe finding real love, when it's not supposed to happen to you, could actually happen? Personally I do, but I'm a real optimist, so perhaps that's why I liked it so much. It might also be because it gives a very optimistic view towards life.I guess the real strength of this movie lies in the fact that even after the movie has ended, you are still thinking about it. The story is simple, very universal, but also subtle and deep.I could talk for hours about this movie, but I guess you'll have to see it for yourself. My advice to everybody, but especially to the people who love Italy as much as I do Sit down, relax and enjoy. I give it a 8.5/10.

On second viewing recently, Pane e Tulipani looks still fresh. This is a film that seems to be telling us never be afraid to take a stand and to experiment. The film has the feeling of a travelogue because they way it starts, but in fact, it's more like a voyage of discovery.When the film opens we see the Italian tour group at one of the ancient ruins in their country. As the trip continue, our eyes are set on the gorgeous Rosalba, the middle age woman who is among the passengers with her husband and two children. Soon we watch as the bus departing without Rosalba, who is late for it. She can't believe her eyes! The nerve of the husband and children! How dare them! Thus begins a trip in which Rosalba will discover what a sham her married life is. Instead of going home to Pescara, she decides to go to Venice. After all, she's never been there and on a whim she sets for the ancient city on the Adriatic. The next train will be the following day. She decides to play tourist.When she goes to the Marco Polo restaurant, she meets the sad waiter, Fernando Girasoli. She has to do with a cold supper since the cook has been taken ill. This encounter proves to be the happiest thing that has ever happened to Rosalba. When she misses the train the following day, she goes back to the restaurant to eat. Since she doesn't have enough money, she asks Fernando if he knows of a place she can stay for the amount of money she still has. Fernando, in a kind gesture, lets her stay at his small apartment for the night.Venice, alas, has played a trick on Rosalba. Suddenly she feels liberated from the doldrums of her married life. She is free to do what she pleases, whenever she wants, and calls home and tells them she is taking a vacation, after the kind Fermo, at the flower shop, has given her a job.The arrival of Rosalba plays heavily on Fernando. He is a mysterious man who leads us into believing he is trying to end his life by committing suicide. Rosalba discovers things about Fernando, who, at the same time, is learning things about her. We watch as these two become closer. But suddenly, when the detective Rosalba's husband has sent to look for her, finds her, she goes home, resigned to go back to being a housewife to a husband that cheats on her and mother to children that don't appreciate her. That is, until she gets the pictures developed from all the key moments of her adventure, especially of her happy stay in Venice. We know what she will do next! Mr. Soldini's film is greatly enhanced by Licia Maghetta, the intelligent actress portraying the middle aged wife. Ms. Maghetta wins us over because we realize she needs something else in her life. Bruno Ganz, a wonderful and resourceful actor, makes the most out of the taciturn Fernando. The film is worth seeing just to watch these two actors interact with one another. The rest of the cast is good.This is a film that will warm one's heart. "},{"Title":"Wonderful Performance by Licia Maglietta","Date":"20 July 2002","Score":"24 out of 27 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Romance","Review":"  This film is a journey of discovery and self-awareness, a story about life and love and finding the true happiness that comes from sharing it all `with' someone, rather than merely settling for sharing `in' someone else's.  Mostly, though, `Bread and Tulips,' directed by Silvio Soldini, is about finding the kind of love that enfolds you, lifts you up and boldly takes you with it, in place of the kind that simply allows you to catch hold and follow along.  It's about possibilities; of realizing the fulfillment of the promise instead of forever existing in the shadow of the potential, of recognizing what can be and embracing it once it's found-- a consideration that love in the purest sense does exist, and often in the least likely of places.  It's just a matter of opening the heart, and finding it.Rosalba Barletta (Licia Maglietta) is content with her life, or so it would seem; she's a housewife with two sons-- aged sixteen and eighteen-- and a husband, Mimmo (Antonio Catania), who sells bathroom fixtures.  Her contentment, though, is perhaps due to the fact that she's never considered the possibility of anything being otherwise.  But that changes when, while on vacation with the family, she is inadvertently left behind at a stop.  She watches the tour bus pull away and suddenly realizes that her husband and boys haven't even missed her.  She decides to hitchhike home, but on the way, she decides to take a vacation of her own first.  One of her rides is headed to Venice, a city to which she has never been but always wanted to go, and so she makes that her destination.  And her vacation soon becomes more than that; it becomes an experience that opens up a whole new perspective on life to her, an adventure that reawakens her senses and fills her with an appreciation of life and what love really is.  There is bad with the good, however, as it also makes her a woman torn between her old life with the family she loves but who take her for granted, and a new life, in which real love and personal fulfillment is possible.  Whatever she decides, one thing is certain  This is one vacation Rosalba is never going to forget.Director Soldini has crafted and delivered an engaging and thoroughly involving and thoughtful film that grabs hold of the viewer and sweeps you along with it.  It's funny, romantic and poignant, with a pure joy for life at it's heart; a romantic film in every sense of the word.  Soldini tells Rosalba's story in a way that makes you more than a mere observer, but one who is sharing her life and all that she is feeling.  Rosalba is someone you care about, and it's because Soldini has taken great care in attempting to establish that necessary connection between his character and the audience-- and he succeeds.  He sets a perfect pace, in that Rosalba's growth and awareness is gradual, the product of subtle exploration rather than epiphany, which makes all that transpires entirely credible.  And in the same way, it serves the credibility of the other characters, as well.  It's a very grounded presentation that gives the sense of everything happening in real time; Soldini never allows the story to get ahead of itself, and that's part of the bond he's created that allows the audience to keep living it rather than just watching.The insightful screenplay by Soldini and Doriana Leondeff makes for an engaging film to begin with, but without question, what really sells it is the wonderful performance by Licia Maglietta as Rosalba.  Honest and earthy, her portrayal is entirely convincing and believable; she opens up her character and lets you in, where you discover an inner beauty that is vibrant and endearing.  And you realize how much Rosalba has to give, and how much she wants to give-- and it's a touching experience; this is a woman who receives by giving, and it's gratifying to encounter that kind of charity of soul, and moreover, to see it rewarded in kind.  Most importantly, Maglietta's performance inspires a greater understanding of the human condition; by experiencing the rewards of discovering who Rosalba really is, one may be inclined thereafter to look deeper into others, to reflect upon the nature of those perhaps taken for granted for too long.  And the fact that such an impact can be made through a character in a film attests to the talent and ability of Maglietta, who-- something of a cross between Sophia Loren and Giulietta Masina-- has an absorbing screen presence, and plays Rosalba so beautifully.Bruno Ganz also gives a memorable performance as Fernando Girasoli, the man who befriends Rosalba in Venice.  His portrayal is so subtle and understated, and so giving, in that he allows the focus to remain on Rosalba at all times, that the full impact of his character kind of sneaks up on you.  The initial meeting between Rosalba and Fernando is so indifferent that he at first appears to be nothing more than a peripheral character in the drama.  And it demonstrates how wonderfully Soldini and his actors have integrated the characters with the story to make it play out in such real terms.  It's an affecting performance by Ganz, who sparks an unlikely chemistry with Maglietta that works so well on the screen.Also turning in performances worthy of mention are Marina Massironi, as Rosalba's friend, Grazia, the holistic beautician/masseuse; and Giuseppe Battiston, as Costantino, the hapless plumber/detective.The supporting cast includes Felice Andreasi (Fermo), Tiziano Cucchiarelli (Nic), Matteo Febo (Salvo), Tatiana Lepore (Adele) and Vitalba Andrea (Ketty).  Highly entertaining and thoroughly involving on a very personal level, `Bread and Tulips' is a film that provides an unforgettable emotional experience; one that promotes a deeper understanding of human nature by allowing you to get outside of yourself, which ultimately affords a fresh perspective on life and the way we live it.  9/10.

Well, it has to be universal and deep and yet simple. It should appeal beyond the critics and reach the critical mass. I can't say if Bread and Tulips can be termed as a Classic already ... but it does satisfy all three above mentioned conditions. It is simply put, very universal yet subtle and deep. It builds intriguing moments... that viewer keeps even after the movie ends. How real or logical or practical the story is or is it a fairy tale?Well, how many times in real life we act logical? The fact that human being is NOT a logical creature and they act per their impulse and dream for their dreams to come true ... this can be categorized as a quite close thing that may happen to someone. Or at least someone may not be disappointed if that happens to her/him. In short, its not a everyday incident. But YES ... it can happen and well, bits and pieces DO happen in life.Overall it gives a tremendously optimistic view towards life ... I would argue a real inspiring outcome. It portrays a middle aged woman getting close to her real life and real likings when circumstance puts her away from the typical and logical setting in her family. She finds her confidence back, finds friends, finds likings and music ... and finally yes, finds her love. Its a transformation that she goes through ... and none of which is quite aceptable or normal in our civilized society. But even then, she had to go out of defined way to get that. In that process, this movie creates great shots and moments that builds the environment and confirms it to a classic comedy. Worth watching ... and worth owning.

After a mishap in a restroom bathroom, Rosalba (Licia Maglietta) is left behind by the tour bus with her family not even noticing her absence.  Impulsively, Rosalba hitchhikes to Venice. The formula in the film for a newfound awakening of the spirit is simple if somewhat unlikely.  First, find a spare room in the apartment of an eloquently speaking, if somewhat suicidal, Icelandic waiter (Bruno Ganz). Secondly, replace tacky touristy outfit with a brand new wardrobe of pretty bohemian dresses.  Next, befriend your questionably legitimate `holistic beautician and masseuse' neighbor (Marina Massironi).  After, find a satisfying job working for an anarchic florist (Felice Andreasi).  Also, confront the plumber/ amateur detective (Guiseppe Battiston) your husband has hired to track you down.  Finally, aid your new band of quirky friends along the path of self discovery while doing so yourself. The basic storyline of Bread and Tulips is not an especially original one, but the film is exceptional in its surprising delicacy in which it handles the story.  The humor is sophisticated and the romantic story is never overly sweet.  This movie is worth seeing not because it has some deep, life changing message.  It is simply a romantic comedy made to entertain, but it is romantic comedy at its best.  It is handled very differently than it would have been if it had been made in Hollywood, from the subtle sexiest of Licia Maglietta's character to the total lack of sexual references between the main romantic couple.  The characters are unrealistic but not to the point of being ridiculous.  The ending is happy without being disgustingly sentimental. Bread and Tulips was directed by Silvio Soldini who also co-wrote it with Doriana Leondeff.  It won nine David di Donatello Awards, the Italian Oscar equivalent, including Best Picture, Best Director, Best Actor, Best Actress, Best Supporting Actress and Best Supporting Actor.  This film is a refreshing new look at a clichéd idea.

It IS sort of a fairy tale, as they say-- but more than this, it's well-written, beautifully set and properly cast. The protagonist is a woman who strays accidentally (?) from her tour group and finds her place in the older, almost bohemian district of Venice. Her new friends are quirky but endearing from the start, and she lives cozily in the center of this artistic enclave. All of this contrasts so well with the suburban drudgery she left behind-- it's as though she'd spent half of her life marking time in a world with which she felt no connection. It's not a story of angst or alienation-- just everyday people, creating for themselves the lives they were meant to lead.I've watched the DVD dozens of times, where I barely make it halfway through most fictional flicks. Not a single scene is wasted. If I had to select one film for my very highest recommendation, this would be the one!

Although the setup of this film left me fidgeting for action, when I saw her liberated from her family and slowly begin her renewal, I fell in love again with Italy and European mature-woman idolatry. I don't know if it's the ample breasts, knowing smiles, or willingness to sass that gets my attention, or maybe all of the above. I do know 2 hours of these savvy women are far more satisfying than any days with Julia Roberts or Kirsten Dunst.Let me not ignore the true man in this tale Bruno Ganz, the angel from `Wings of Desire,' plays brooding waiter Fernando, ready at any moment to hang himself until Rosealba renews his love of love and epic verse.  Ganz is a marvel of understated acting, a perfect companion to the romantic Rosealba.The inevitable comparison between director Silvio Soldini and Woody Allen, with their genial sense of city and women, is appropriate, especially considering the similarity between Soldini's romantic Venice and Allen's lyrical Paris in `Everyone Says I Love You.'`Bread and Tulips' received several David Di Donatello Awards, the Italian version of the Oscars, for best picture, actor, actress, supporting actor, supporting actress, director, and three others.  To see Rosealba go from frumpy mom to bohemian accordion and tulip player is worth wading through a boring Wayne Knight, wanabee plumber cum detective or over the top, philandering, bourgeois bathroom fixtures magnate husband. Some of this stuff is downright dull slapstick, a little like the sophomoric stumbling of `Life is Beautiful,' but when Rosealba smiles, it's very good.

It's beyond just warm and colorful, with scenes of Venice night and day, and beyond just triumphant, with true love winning in more ways than one. It is most of all populated with great characters. Italian leading lady Licia Maglietta is a wonder of naturalistic acting. She is sympathetic of course, but not a cliché. She plays a housewife on a diversion away from her family, and she looks and acts like a housewife. As strong as she is, and as independent, she is also devoted to her family. The fact she left them at all is perfectly unfolded as an accident that she turns into an opportunity, all by intuition. The man she meets is no paradigm of handsome or charming, in fact he's just the opposite. But he is so inherently good, a really decent human being, she comes to like him, and look out for him. Played by Swiss actor Bruno Ganz, he matches Maglietta's believable ease and imperfect, quiet intensity. The rest of the cast is truly supportive, and tips just slightly (or more than slightly in one case) into caricature, to reminds us, I suppose, that this is a movie, a fantasy, a comedy in many ways.But it's also a deeply serious and moving love story between two middle-aged people who are ready for renewal.I have a feeling many people, especially people with families or those conservative at heart, will find the basic premise of a woman leaving her family in a glib and almost carefree way and not going back for a long time to be shameful or even sinful. Her kids are normal distracted teenagers who like her when they notice her, her husband is a hardworking and loud businessman who doesn't beat her, her home is her own and comfortable. In other words, she has a really normal life, a good one by most measures. Does everyone have the right to up and leave a working family relationship because they feel a bit restless? Is this movie a worship of selfishness?Or is it a reminder that life is short and you have to get to what really matters, and be with people who are truly wonderful and good, no matter what?I can't think of a more joyous way to ask the question.

In other words, perfect harmless entertainment.

They are over-the-top but at the same time kept humane. It helps to make the movie an enjoyable one to watch and at the same time also keeps sure that the emotions of the movie feel real.The movie features a nice story in which a married mother escapes her normal everyday life after she has been forgotten during a vacation by the tour bus. She decides to take advantage of the situation by hitchhiking to Venic, the city she always wanted to visit. perhaps for the first time ever in her life she feels herself alive and home somewhere, where she really can be herself. She decides to stay for a day but the day soon becomes days and the days weeks.For a change the movie centrally features a love-story between 2 persons at age and not persons who are still in the prime of their life and are in their early 20's, or something. It's refreshing, dramatic more powerful and involving and in a way also sweeter.Licia Maglietta is a good leading lady for the movie. and she forms a good couple with Bruno Ganz, who is halve Swiss, halve Italian and by far has the best lines of the movie, that almost sound poetic like. The rest of the supporting actors are mainly for the fun but everyone does a good job at portraying them.The movie is however not the best made and constructed one. At times they simply choose not to show some of the dramatic responses and just cut away and goes forward in time or back to another location. In my opinion this is a sign of weakness of the film-maker's skills and it's also definitely due to the editing that the movie does not work out at all times.Nevertheless, you should be able to appreciate and enjoy watching this movie.7/10http//bobafett1138.blogspot.com/ "},{"Title":"Funny, feel-good romance with charm to spare.","Date":"6 December 2002","Score":"3 out of 3 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Romance","Review":"  A delightful comedy about a forty-something housewife accidentally left behind at a rest-stop on the outskirts of Rome by a tour bus in which her husband and two sons are riding.

There are some very funny lines. But it's not a gutbuster. It's more subtle than that.A most human drama. Characters are drawn from real life, given just enough idiosyncrasy to make them interesting, not abstractions. I thought it was as gender fair as any movie I've seen  both the women and men are equally shown as flawed, ignorant, sinister, mean, or noble and generous without making the case for one sex being preponderantly more prone to such failings or graces than the other gender. It is directed with a nurturing gentleness reflective of a female director . . .although the director is a man and the co-writer a woman. The story's protagonist is a woman whose heart has been relegated to second-class by all the self-serving males who surround her. . . her intimacy sacrificed. A woman can understand another woman in this conflict more naturally than men usually can which makes the director's accomplishment all the more remarkable.If you're up for a romantic movie comedically driven but full of pathos, look no further.

No one dies, no car crashes, explosions etc. NOT a Hollywood movie. Interesting characters, humor, fun and colorful scenes make it a joy to watch. Licia Maglietta is a housewife who is left behind on a vacation with her family and embarks on an adventure. And nothing really bad happens to her. God forbid! If you want a movie with gritty reality, this probably isn't what you are looking for. Licia Maglietta plays a kind of klutzy, out of sorts woman with a whimsical air that never devolves into slapstick, or the kind of behavior that would make you think she is stupid. She did, after all have a family, and took care of them well. But that, we can tell, isn't enough sometimes, and when it's not, things get broken. Or you can get lost.The film is sweet and fun, but not too sweet. And to see such a beautiful mature woman in a movie, instead of some cookie cutter young Hollywood flavor of the year, is a treat in itself. And so beautiful she is!

Mean-spirited, juvenile romps of American Pie nature have relegated romantic classics like Moonstruck and Only You to dusty video shelves.  Anyone desiring a tasteful, amusing film should look to arrivals from overseas, like the jovial Italian comedy Bread & Tulips (Pane e Tulipani), the winner of nine David Di Donatello Awards (Italian Oscars). Splendidly directed by Silvio Soldini, the films stars Licia Maglietta as Rosalba, a cloistered, middle-aged housewife who is so ignored by her husband and two teenage sons, they literally forget her during a family trip to Rome they board the tourist bus while she is in the rest room.  Using this abandonment to her advantage, she hitchhikes to Venice, the city she has mused visiting her entire life.  There, Rosalba meets a medley of charming, idiosyncratic, though very human characters Grazia, a self-described holistic beautician and masseuse; Fermo, the temperamental florist who employs her; and Fernando, the shy, forlorn waiter who gives her shelter at his book-cluttered apartment.  Then, there is Costantino, the nerdy plumber hired by Rosalba's husband as a PI because he has read 285 and a half detective stories.  His orders are to find Rosalba and return her home - a challenging task, since she has finally tasted independence and desires not to part with it. The Bread & Tulips DVD features the widescreen version of the film with optional English subtitles.

I guess in this fast speed world we tend to forget that age groups 50 and above are also entitled to inspiring and driving forces of affection! Majority of older people do perceive their love as something simple as eating bread (the title!), something that you just don't think about and something that becomes habitual part of your everyday life. It is then after watching movie like this one that we realize that at that age the feelings can be even deeper than fatalistic teenage Romeo and Juliet-ready to die type of love.The recent movies that I saw dealing with similar topic were of European production but one American that has similar atmosphere comes to my mind- Bridges of Madison County. Usually the pace in these movies is very slow (like great French movie Under the Sand) but that is necessary in order to create the focus on the inside. The amount of conversation between these couples is reduced to minimum and atmosphere and silence is used to help us understand the innerfeelings of the characters. I guess in entire film the number of sentences exchanged between Mr. Girasole (translates as sunflower) and Rosalba (translates as white rose) is not more than 100-150. Do  not get me wrong, this is a happy movie with a happy ending, it is a movie about wakening, blooming, breathing again at the age of 50 seen from an angle of very average female Italian women who lives a life of a very average housewife whose passion for life is awakened as she realizes that she is in love again. She starts to relive her childhood fantasies with her aged eyes (playing harmonica for example and working in flower shop) It is not one of the best movies that I have ever seen (there are some scenes that are unnecessary and superficially obvious-the role of detective and holistic masseuse,for example) but you leave movie theater inspired and with a smile on your face.

We are abandoning 25 and 15 years each of conservative evangelical Christianity and looking for a faith in Jesus, the Father and the Holy Spirit that fits more with our emphasis on our post-modern worldview.  But this renaissance is not without faltering, fears, soaring hopes that might go unfulfilled and a strange, inexplicable urging to move out of what is known, comfortable and deeply undesirable into a place of freedom, dangerous and deeply longed for.When I read this movie's DVD box at Blockbuster, there was something about its description that resonated with me as a potential metaphor for our journey.  Bread And Tulips proved to be just that.This isn't your characteristic chick flick schmaltzy romance.  This is a thoughtful comedy about a woman who realizes that the man in her life is so inured to her presence that he allows a tour bus to leave her behind at a rest stop. The realization of her abandonment by a man she has been with for many years leads her to an uncertain rebellion and abandonment of her own. And she begins a journey into relationships and life experiences that she probably always secretly longed for but never fulfilled.What made this movie enjoyable for me was its humorous approach toward the serious decision one takes when confronted with the disappointing safety of a lifestyle long familiar.  Moving into a dangerous adventure that ultimately results in abandoning what is known for the unknown is a scary pursuit but it was one that Rosalba Barletta was inexplicably compelled to make.  It didn't trivialize the metamorphosis or protect the viewer from the tension and anxiety of what she did with her life. Yet through humor, it helped you realize that the life change is not completely disruptive. There is pleasure in it too.There is guilt, fear, shame, self-consciousness and attacks from other people as with any renaissance.  Any time someone strays off the path of what is accepted, there is a good chance that the other sheep will baaa-aaa-aaa their rebukes as they amble to the feeding fields or the slaughter house. Rosalba feels all these emotions and more.  And though she makes the decision to abandon her marriage - though you ache at the loss of what she left behind - there is something powerfully beautiful in this decision if you watch the movie as a metaphor rather than as an expression of what is wrong in the world.As viewers, we need to perceive the divorce as a symbolic one, perhaps a transformative image of something that is calling all of us to abandon our good and safe lives in order to pursue something reckless, inchoate and uncertain.  I wonder how many times the renaissance siren calls to each of us and I wonder if that siren eventually gives up its call to the sheep in search of those who will heed its compelling movement and reinvent their lives two or three times.

She impulsively decides to take her own vacation, accepts a ride from a stranger, and without luggage, without her indifferent teenage boys and verbally abusive husband, finds a new life in Venice--not the pretty postcard stuff, although that is there, but in the tiny, crowded alleys and undiscovered marble plazas away from Piazza San Marco, where she finds new life rich with human connection--a melancholy waiter with a strange past and an accordion in the closet, a new-age massage therapist, an anarchist philosopher that runs a floral shop, and even the plumber-detective sent by her husband to bring her back home.These folks are not merely zany caricatures with no life, not silly stereotypes, but are folks we learn to like, just as Maglietta does; this is a sweet film without being cloying, a funny film without being stupid, and even romantic without being sappy.

This movie, like most Italian movies I have seen doesn't have that.I was very pleasantly surprised with the movie and it has stuck in my mind for quite a while after having watched it. It is not art like like a Fellini movie, and i would say it is a notch below an Il Postini or Cinema Paradisimo.I think it does an accurate job portraying the modern day Italy. There are places in Italy that are absolutely beautiful and others that are not. Many movies only show the beautiful parts and I think that this could be done on purpose to show the good and bad parts of both Fernando and Rosalba's lives.The movie takes a lot of twists and turns that are not predictable; the noose, Fernando's family, the dream or reality scene at the end. These keep the movie flowing. While some have said the story isn't realistic, the character development is great. I felt like i knew both of the leads be the end of the story. There is the conflict of wanting Rosalba to find happiness with Fernando, job satisfaction in the flower shop in Venice vs her family obligation to her children, housewife boredom(and cheating husband).Overall I think this is a pretty good movie and is worth seeing. I would rank it in the top quarter of the 20 or so Italian movies (excluding those Rome movies-separate category) that I have seen. It can get funny at times, bordering on silly, unrealistic perhaps, but the leads are great and the movie keeps you guessing. Oh, and its great for supplementing my Italian study efforts.

On a vacation she is accidentally left behind in Venice, and then on a whim decides to stay for awhile. She needs to breathe free from the domination of her husband who sees her only as an asset and doesn't love her. Indeed he has a mistress.What she finds in Venice are new warm friends and a certain man, Fernando Girasoli (played with sly finesse by veteran Swiss-born actor Bruno Ganz), who speaks in poetic phrases but wants to hang himself. She also rediscovers a delight in life and the freedom to be herself and do what she wants to do, which includes playing the accordion and reading Mark Twain in bed. She finds a job in a flower shop, a small room, makes friends with the masseuse next door and feels alive for the first time in ages.Her husband sends a plumber he is about to hire to play detective, find her and bring her back, resulting in some light comedic episodes enriched by off-beat characters.Malietta is very winning in the part and certainly will serve as a heroine for frustrated housewives everywhere. Her desire is not for a fling or for physical thrills, rather her desire is to find herself as herself apart from her identification as wife and mother.I have hinted above at her eventual choice, but you will have to see this warm-hearted romantic comedy for yourself to find out what she chooses and why.(Note Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!

I didn't intend this to be a review of 2 films, but they're so similar that it's hard not to draw parallels. Let me put it this way if subtitles don't bother you, and you like a stronger Mediterranean flavor, see Bread and Tulips; if you want a more accessible, dialogue-in-English adventure, see Shirley Valentine. Even better would be to see both and draw your own comparisons.

The plot unfolds gradually to help usto understand what is happening to change the mousy 'housewife'into an inquisitive, interesting person. When she arrives in Venice, Rosalba takes a room in a small'pensionne' - for a night but ends up staying for much longer. Shegets a room near the waiter Fernando (Bruno Ganz) who is fromIceland, and depressed, but kindly and attentive.. Then she gets a job in the local florist shop that is run by a crankyanarchist (Felice Andreasi) and she makes friends with the wackyneighbour Grazia( Marina Massironi), playing a holistic masseuse.Her husband and teenage sons don't seem to miss her much tillthe housework builds up, so hubby hires a plump plumber whoreads detective novels, Costantino (Guiseppe Battiston) to go toVenice, to track his wife down. We get to see some of thewaterways of Venice when the plumber/detective finds a cosyone-room canal boat.  'Bread and Tulips' shows us how it could be so easy for someoneto accept living in a rut....... What do you do when your marriage becomes so predictable thatyou know not to question your husband's taste in a mistress? As the movie develops we see how the woman, Rosalba comes toher senses and begins to live a life full of meaning for herself andher friends around her.  The characters wander about as a part of the ordinary Venetianpersons' daily life, -you feel they must be lucky to be surrounded bythe waterways of Venice. This movie is a well-made movie and the way the characters areinterwoven with emotions and personal development remindedme of the same sense of mystery and sentimental interaction thatwas shown in 'Chocolat'. I liked Chocolat' and if you did too you'll probably like 'Bread &Tulips'. It is a simple story told capably.

I offer this IMDB comment as a tag to my `Lovely & Amazing' comments. Having said that, I realize the scope and content that writer/director Nicole Holofcener was attempting and failed as I viewed `Pane e tulipani'. Both films have a 90% common base in its story three women who are making decisions in life about their selves and their marriage or partners or no partners &#150; or any of those combinations.  Each film wagged me in different directions of credibility. `Bread & Tulips' arrived first and `Lovely & Amazing' trailed by one year with a similar story.I vote 'Pane e tulipani' (Bread & Tulips) as the exceptional film, and will stay solid with my opinion of `Lovely & Amazing' (2001) as posted.Nicole Holofcener (Lovely & Amazing) apparently was influenced by  `Bread & Tulips' then decided to produce a quick VIDEO SHOOT in quick time for those outside of Italy in an attempt to race to the marketplace with a good idea.

Except for one thing despite its superficiality...  I didn't find it superficial.  It was a fairy tale, but I thought the emotions were real and honest, hardly superficial.  It did strain believability to have the events, as they unfolded, play out in a realistic way -- maybe that's what TJ meant -- but that didn't matter.What struck me is how true the director (Silvio Soldini) stayed to his vision.  Licia Maglietta was absolutely adorable as she stumbled and fumbled her way into our sympathetic hearts.  We were goners before we knew what the director had up his sleeve.  And he had plenty, didn't he?  We cared about all the characters, including Constantino (the ersatz PI).  And Mr. Soldini never fall over the line into ridiculousness.  How could he have managed to keep us sympathetic to both Constantino and Alba when he was stalking her? Only by honest understanding of the characters and their motivations and respect for their predicaments.Even Bruno Ganz's performance was perfection.  The secret was when he told his grandson that felicity  (or was it love) knocked at his door, but he wasn't listening.  That's exactly the way he played his character from Alba's first moments in the restaurant until he claimed her at the supermarket parking lot.  You could see he never wanted to intrude on her privacy.  There was some hint of sexual fluttering on her face, but none on his.  He was so self-absorbed in his pain, he didn't see what was happening, just as he explained it in his florid speech to his grandson.  Was that superb characterization, plotting, and directing, or what?  To have all those moments of diffidence and uncertainty pay off in this confession to a 9-year old child, I found truly awesome.I tried to imagine afterwards what a farce Roberto Benigni would have made of this film, falling into the trap of broad physical humor.  (When she splashed water on her face while trying to retrieve her earring from the toilet bowl, the look that flashed across her face was one of the most brilliantly understated moments in film comedy I think I've ever seen. Like every other middle-aged + man who sees this film, I'm hoplelessly in love with Alba.)  But this movie is all about love and vulnerability and defenselessness.  Except for the husband and a bit the florist with his gruff manner obscuring his sensitivity, everyone in the film is a bundle of exposed nerve endings, and how carefully Soldini holds them in his capable and empathetic hands.Pane e Tulipani is simply one of my all-time favorite films, perhaps it is no. 1.

Rosalba's (Maglietta)'s husband, Mimmo, dispatches a private detective, actually a plumber who came to him for work, to bring her back home. Comedic and romantic complications ensue.The revelation here is Licia Maglietta. She is simply one of the most beautiful women I have ever seen in a movie. She's not just beautiful, she is entrancing. I'd put her appeal in the same class with Garbo. There is a scene where she wrenches a tune out of an accordion (it's actually her playing the accordion) and the look of pleasure on her face has more life and sex appeal than most actresses can achieve in the most rigorous of love scenes.Bruno Ganz, who has convincingly played both an angel (Wings of Desire) and Hitler (Downfall) is as wonderful as ever as an older waiter.Ganz and Maglietta make very beautiful music together, but, otherwise, the film is underwritten and lightweight. Rosalba says virtually nothing of substance in the entire film. Venice, a picturesque city, is photographed with so little imagination that the movie may as well have taken place in a K-Mart parking lot.There are some nice gags involving a tulip and an antique gun, but, really, I wish this exact same cast could be brought together for a more ambitious, more fully realized film.

There are too many artificial elements in the story to make it a good movie. First of all the plot. It isn´t very elaborated, too constructed and sometimes even obvious sloppy. Two examples. At the beginning we see Rosalba in a sightseeing-bus. The bus stops at a road-house for a short rest and then the bus leaves without her. Her husband detects that she is missing, calls her and tells her to wait until the bus returns. Now I knew from the previews that she will make her own way and I wondered by which means the movie will achieve this. The answer was astonishing simple. There is a rough cut and all the sudden we find her sitting in a strange car without any convincing explanation, why she changed her mind. Another minor but typical detail. Later a detective tries to find her in Venice. Eventually he finds her and they meet. He gets a telephone call and she sneaks away. He follows her and leaves his suitcase behind. But you never get to know how he now makes his way  without his suitcase. Secondly the characters. O.K., I know this is a comedy so you don´t  have to expect any kind of  Ingmar Bermann characters and relationships but do they have to be THAT shallow? The main character Rosalba reminds me of Jackie Brown, a woman in her 40s, still attractive (a rather showy camera-movement along Rosalba´s body at the beginning is employed to overemphasize this) but frustrated with her life. But while Jackie Brown changes her life through responding to the circumstances in a natural, convincing and exciting way, which emerge from the story alone, for Rosalba  there are a lot of extraneous details used. Like her accordion-playing, knowing how to work with flowers and so on. Another characteristic example is the florist by whom she works. He is a little odd, but that´s it. You can´t take him as a real person. The ending is like you expected it right away, but it is too achieved in a rude way, as if  the writers thought, well this has to be that way but why it becomes this way we don´t really care. This is all the more unsatisfactory than there are some good details. The camera-work especially in Fernando´s apartment is great, I liked Bruno Ganz acting very much and there were nice scenes when Rosalba talked with her son.

I thought this movie would be different. And it was, for the most part. It had likable characters, nice sets, and a light touch; but, the package betrayed the contents.It was the end that brought me down from a flight of fancy. It didn't seem believable when Rosalba looked at Fernando with romantic yearning in her eyes after they went dancing on a whim. Costantino's declaration of love to Grazia had already provided the sweet touch of romance.The movie would have ended on a much more beautiful note, and would have been much more believable, had Fernando, Costantino, and Grazia rescued Rosalba from her indifferent husband, all acting as friends. Rosalba had already saved Fernando's life. Theirs would have been a grand friendship. Instead we are presented with the scenario of a married mother leaving her family behind for a man seemingly old enough to be her father. Once this happened, the movie went from being a possible 9/10 to a 6/10.

It feels like any event happens because the author wanted it to happen, rather than as consequence of the characters' decisions.On top of that its attempts to be funny, but probably I didn't understand its humour.On the positive side the photography is really nice, as it shows Venice in a different light as a quite, charming place with great views of the canals, the calle, and the countryside around it.

However, there are big flaws here. The most obvious are a couple of time-warped scenes that seem to say we couldn't figure out how to make the transition and don't think its worth explaining the motivations, so we just took a quantum leap, use your imagination. The scene when she decides to hitchhike home is one, and obtw, it should have been the inflection point of the entire movie. Instead it feels like they spliced the film badly. This is not the only example. The other major problem is we are left with a summer romance flick that turns into unfaithful, quitter of a runaway bride-and-mother story. Thanks, we need that. I can only imagine the outcry if the shoe were on the other foot, say a man's foot. Imagine if it were a black man that left the wife & kids. Oh boy, we'd be deafened hearing the two sides war. One crying That's what they do. The other bellowing racist stereotyping. So, Italians made it & I'll give Italian women the benefit of the doubt (having spent some time near Genoa with one in a summer romance). maybe they'd be fine with the shoe on the other foot. As for American women, they'd all be giving it a 3 in that circumstance.

She is literally left behind at a bus station by her family while she tries to fish out her wedding ring at the bottom of a toilet, which is essentially her marriage to an over excitable toilet-fixture businessman with a buxom mistress. So, what does our left behind spouse do; she hitchhikes to Venice and arranges to miss her bus home repeatedly as she finds work and a new life in a beautiful canaled city. Enter Bruno Ganz, a suicidal waiter that falls for her immediately. She plays the accordion; he sings. You get the idea, quirky.The film develops very slowly and the laughs are here and there. Licia is nice and we want her to find happiness, but I must say there is a TV sitcom feel to the film, which probably didn't bother the Europeans, but here in America, awash with nightly sitcoms, I felt a little drowsy through Bread and Tulips. "},{"Title":"surprisingly good movie","Date":"9 March 2001","Score":"1 out of 6 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Romance","Review":" It is a highly unrealistic movie, invoking the yearning for the sudden twist in ones live. A movie of unlived desires and dreams of finding great love, meeting people supporting you, knowing the right person for every aspect of your character. She meets a woman to share the sentimental and fun side, a boss who's talking to her about freedom, and a man who realises that he loves her when she's gone and goes to get her. Showing spontaneity and inner freedom that the pessimist in you wants to judge as nonexistent, being disturbed by a voice asking 'why not?'. And you start wondering if you have already missed the chance of the twist in your live, or if you will see it when it arrives, in the words of the film, if you would hear felicity knocking on your door. I have seen a movie covering implicitly deep questions with light comedy and its success should warn you that comedy and easiness prevail.I understand that most people may not agree with my impression. I was very sceptic if I would like the movie because according to the  description I read I expected a shallow plot full of trashy, mushy romanticism. If that's your favourite you will be as satisfied or even more as I am because there's no intrusive philosophy in it, but there is a message for those who like to get one out of a story.In conclusion, despite its superficiality, I quite liked it, because it brought back the questions I try to keep quiet without making me depressive.

Unfortunately, Italian comedies (like comedies of many nations) are central to the definition of what it means to be Italian. And that depends on a pseudo-reality of the characters. One cannot have characters that are unreal and real at the same time -- at least without great skill -- and that's why this fails.But along the way, we have all the points from the screwball playbook the `performance' (here via an accordion), the reporting at a distance (the comical cell phone) and the finding of true love. They just don't register.Ted's Evaluation -- 1 of 4 You can find something better to do with this part of your life.

But after half an hour several problems arise the characters become too clear and uninteresting, fantasy elements are introduced that are useless, the mood just set out is somewhat broken down by irrelevant story lines, the story itself is meandering too much and it even becomes too serious for its own good. Sentimentality replaces romanticism. As the importance of family is decreasing in Italy we see this reflected (and not just in this Italian movie).Licia Maglietta plays the main character with an almost Chaplin-like style. Her new lover Bruno Ganz is spoiled hence too serious an actor for this stuff. Antonia Catania is over the top as her current husband a little balance would have helped.What strikes me here is a lack of coherence all the disciplines involved do their job reasonably (especially art direction), but a director's hand that shapes the project to a sum that is more than the individual elements is lacking. And as most recent Italian movies it fails in taking its own film history into account or at least have some references to it. What I would like to see is a fresh Italian director capable of making groundbreaking movies again. "},{"Title":"Implausible and Contrived","Date":"12 August 2002","Score":"0 out of 5 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Romance","Review":"  Bread and Tulips is designed to appeal to those dissatisfied folk who want to chuck everything and run off to Venice or some other romantic getaway. What more could you want? Accordion music, flowers, the lovely back streets and alleys of Venice, Italy, and a romantic lover who talks in blank verse. The woman who gets her shot at romance in this Italian import is Rosalba (Licia Maglietta). In this often charming, but mostly implausible and contrived comedy, Maglietta portrays a harried housewife who lives to take care of a family that does not appreciate her. While on vacation, she goes to the bathroom, and leaves only to find that her family left, forgetting to take her with them. She sets out on her own, discovers the charm of Venice and meets some unlikely characters along the way. These include a suicidal restaurateur (Bruno Ganz) who knows the meaning of true love (having cheated on his family in the past), a ditzy masseuse who falls for an overweight private detective, a Marxist florist, and a husband who is an expert in detective stories and philandering. Bread and Tulips invites us to escape from the humdrum and damn the consequences. I can hear people saying she should go for it. Yeah! Go for it! Forget pesky things like wedding vows, kids who need their mother at a precarious adolescent stage, household obligations, and so forth. I am not denigrating the movement for women's liberation of which I am a strong supporter and I understand that, especially in Italy, there are still are many more women who stay at home not because they choose to, but because it is what is culturally expected. Yet for me to take this seriously as a timely political statement would require plausible characters and believable situations.Maglietta's performance overwhelms the film with charm, and Bruno Ganz (Wings of Desire) is a very appealing lover; but I frankly expected more from a film that won nine awards, including best film, director, actor, actress, supporting actor, supporting actress, screenplay, and cinematography. Bread and Tulips is a zany feel-good comedy with some good laughs that might have worked better as a TV sitcom.

It is a snoozefest.  Nothing really happens.  The Venice locations are poorly used and filmed.  This film has NO visual flair.  The US equivalent to this film would be a TV movie. This is a fine example of the dribble that is marketed at film-goers around the world.

I am looking forward to The Son's Room but so far, the latest Italians films have disappointed me greatly. Perhaps I am just spoiled with good French cinema that just keeps getting better and better with each decade. I thought Bread and Tulips was too long and just a bit unrealistic. How does a middle aged woman just picks up and leaves her family without at least being concerned about her children? She is portrayed as a major airhead, loosing, dropping, breaking things constantly and bruising herself in the process. She apparently cannot manage her time well, either as she keeps missing her train. Is this behavior supposed to elute our sympathy for her? No wonder her husband eventually lost his nerves with her and just took the approach of a chronic yeller. Any decent man would loose his patience with this woman fast. I was surprised the husband actually wanted to find her.
