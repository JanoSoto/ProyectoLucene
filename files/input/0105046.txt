The 1939 version of this movie is a prime example.  It, very simply, was not the story that Steinbeck wrote.  The changes that were made were too sweeping to be seen as anything other than some ego thinking that Steinbeck could be improved upon.Now, anyone who is truly familiar with Steinbeck knows that this is just not true.  Gary Sinise has proven this familiarity.  I have rarely had the pleasure of watching a movie that stayed so completely true to the original text.  Not only does this movie not add or subtract from the book, the characters themselves are almost exactly how I had pictured them when I read this story for the first time.If you are looking for overblown sex and violence, for spectacular special effects, or for unbelievable demonstrations raw physical strength, move on. This movie will not interest you in the slightest.  However, if you are looking for a story of true love and true courage, if you are looking for a movie whose beauty stems from a raw sense of humanity, then find yourself a quiet place, where you won't be interrupted and watch this.  You won't be let down.

The screenplay brings to life the tragic yet uplifting story of loyalty and the kind of bond that can grow between men that we are often reluctant to acknowledge, much less show.Aside from the story, the cast is what really makes this film.  I have always held a soft spot for Gary Sinise after his role in Forrest Gump, wherein his character portrayed another facet of the bonding between men made brothers by cruel circumstance, yet can grow and flourish as the years and other circumstances come to pass.  Here, as Lenny's friend and protector against a world that baffles and confuses him, he shows the kind of rough-edged tenderness and affection that both endears us to his plight, and fills us with the dread of what we know must come between the men.  John Malkovich shows his depth as an actor by bringing to life the dull-witted but pure-hearted Lenny, in a way that will tug at your heartstrings.  I found myself both laughing (in a sad way) at Lenny's ineptness in dealing with a world clearly more confusing than his limited wits can manage, and crying over his being targeted for taunting and abuse by cruel and crude men, and ultimately done in by his brute strength when it was lacking the direction and temper given by his friend George.A pleasant surprise was Ray Walston as the aged but gentle and good-hearted ranch hand Candy, who has no one in life to love but his old sheepdog, who, like him, he knows, must ultimately be put down because of age and the wear and tear that a life of hard labor has worn down.  The scene of his finally surrendering his faithful canine companion to be euthanized by a gunshot to the back of the head by another well-meaning field hand is very heartbreaking.  Having grown up with the Uncle Martin of My Favorite Martian Walston, seeing his adept performance in a dramatic role gave me a new appreciation for his versatility as a character actor.Those who watch this film should allow plenty of time alone to view it straight through with no interruptions.  Swallow your pride and keep a box of tissues handy, and some time afterwards for quiet contemplation and recovery.

Gary Sinise does a very good job of showing what a complicated and conflicted character George is.   George seems to be a smart man, but he has not gotten far in life.  He feels the need to watch out for his closest friend, Lenny.  But, you sense that George sometimes thinks Lenny is a burden and George feels guilty about those thoughts.  This might be Gary Sinise's best acting performance. I was disappointed in John Malkovich's over-the-top portrayal of Lenny.  In the book, I felt that Lenny was just very simple minded, but in the movie version, Lenny seems to be seriously retarded.  The Malkovich Lenny has too many odd facial expressions and a speaking style that is like a cartoon parody Lenny.  That performance was distracting and irritating and made Lenny less sympathetic.  It also changed the relationship with George.  It makes George more of a nursemaid to seriously ill Lenny, instead of a helpful friend who watches out for Lenny.

George is a pretty sharp guy, but Lenny is mentally handicapped; a giant of a man, he is a phenomenal worker, but his mental and emotional shortcomings continually land the two men in hot water. When they end up at a particular ranch in Salinas, the men encounter trouble that no amount of running away will solve.Steinbeck's book is particularly depressing (as I find the works of many early 20th century American authors to be), and the movie captures that exceptionally, without making it a depressing experience to view. Steinbeck's themes of loneliness, of the harshness of life, of how unfair things can be, are all carried over into the film adroitly; but Sinise manages to capture the beautiful California landscape, and in particular that golden sunlight, to at least add a veneer of beauty to the disheartening proceedings.The acting is uniformly excellent here. Sinise's George is world-weary, cautious, and protective of Lenny; he understands his burden fully and as in the book curses his relationship with Lenny even while we know it is an obligation he will never willingly forsake. The bit parts are all fine as well, with Sherilyn Fenn playing Curley's Wife to perfection; Ray Walston is wonderfully low-key as the lonely, used-up Candy; and Joe Morton as Crook only gets one scene, but he runs the gamut from anger to fear to camaraderie and loneliness, shifting effortlessly in the space of a few minutes. But really, even with all the fine performances, the movie is Malkovitch's. I've never been a huge fan of his work, but he is perfect here as Lenny; he captures the man's childlike worldview, his instant joy in small things, his fear of being stranded by George, and even Lenny's anger just perfectly. Watching Malkovich in this movie is watching a master at the top of his craft; Lenny instantly catches the viewer's sympathy, and Malkovich makes it obvious why George is both irritated by and yet loves the big lunk.The last scene (I won't spoil it, in case you have forgotten or never read it) is one of the classics of cinema, I feel. The emotion is so powerful, yet so subtly played by both actors; you know what must happen, what George must do, and yet, even as he steels himself to the task, we can see how difficult it is for him. At one point Senise bows his head, eyes screwed shut, on Malkovich's shoulder; this small gesture speaks volumes about the bond between the two men, about everything that Steinbeck was trying to say about love and friendship, and loneliness. It sums up the whole book, the whole film, in an instant. Simply put, this is a brilliant adaptation, well worth your time to investigate.

Like the cheerful Nazi, rowing his charges to their doom, drowning the cripple, in Lifeboat, here again we see his dark view of life and human beings. Lenny and George are itinerant farm workers who are forced to flee because Lenny, inadvertently, destroys what he loves. His weak, childish mind comes with deadly great physical strength. George is forced to flee with him; as the movie opens they are avoiding another angry mob hot on their trail. Their new work site has all the ingredients for the final tragedy. A cruel, sadistic bosses' son with a bored, wandering wife who takes a fatal interest in Lenny. A dream sustains these sufferers in their trials the farm they will buy someday. Lenny always bugs George to tell it to him to lessen the pain and cruelty of their endless work. Candy, the old worn-out worker, seizes upon their fantasy; after his dog is cruelly taken away from him and shot off camera, he begs them to let him throw in with them and their sad, quixotic plans. That scene is the quintessence of Steinbeck, Candy has but this old crippled, worn out dog. They harass him constantly to let them shoot it. Candy, fearing for his own job, given how old and weak he has become, accedes but immediately recants. It is too late, we hear the gunshot in the background.We see Candy curl up on his bunk, I wish somebody would take me out and shoot me. This is the central motif of Steinbeck the world's hostility and its cruelty towards the old, sick or crippled. We know what is coming, indeed, so does George. Lenny's doom haunts the movie way before it overtakes them all. He simply cannot watch Lenny every single minute. Lenny accidentally crushes a puppy to death, a harbinger of what is to come. We witness Lenny's terrifying physical power when Curley, the cruel boss, provokes him and gets every bone in his hands crushed. Yes, my friends, the plans of mice and men do amount to nothing in this cruel world. Steinbeck makes his point in a powerful fashion. I love the original but really the acting here is far superior. Malkovich and Sinise give their best readings in any movie. Malkovich gives my favorite performance here. Walston, as Candy, also steals all of his scenes. It is dark as night, just like Grapes Of Wrath, but where that ended with a note of hope this one shows us George fleeing on a train eyes filled with anguish for the worst of all duties of a protector destruction.SPOILER George is faced with this horrible Hobbesian choice kill Lenny quickly and mercifully or let the cruel mob get their hands on him. Why should you watch it? Because, if you are most unfortunate in life, this horrible choice will be yours. Soldiers on the battlefield make this choice everyday as we speak. Love, sadly, sometimes commands the most difficult duty of compassion annihilation of the loved. My favorite scene is also the hardest to endure; George tells Lenny to look over at the beautiful stream and tells him a final time about the rabbits he will own someday. He then shoots him quickly and mercifully. The scene shows you that even in destruction love can still be expressed and goodness fulfilled. When we last see him on the train, the pain in his eyes tells us all we need to know about his future. A terribly dark, sad tale that is worthy of viewing; I do not do it often but it is necessary never to hide from the worst side of life. Look the Gorgon in her face, if you do not turn to stone, you will be stronger to be of service as a protector. Steinbeck's lesson is to show you how cruel and unforgiving the world can be and to prepare you for the hardest of all choices. Yet, even in darkest night, the Light can always guide your hands.

I would associate this film more with Horton Foote the brilliant scriptwriter, who sculpted the script from a great book by a formidable author, John Steinbeck.When I read Steinbeck's book I was in awe of the author's powerful strokes of simplicity. Adapting the book into a screenplay can be formidable. Foote did it earlier with Harper Lee's novel To kill a Mockingbird. He did it again in Beresford's Tender Mercies. Some of the flashes of brilliance in the script are the opening sequence of the woman running scared into the camera, the opening and closing images of light falling on the dark insides of a train car, the empty bus ride that Steinbeck did not present. Director Gary Sinise and Foote made the adaptation of the novel on screen look easier by adding details just as scriptwriter Robert Bolt and director David Lean did the opposite by compressing the details with Pasternak's Doctor Zhivago. Both Dr Zhivago and Of Mice and Men are great examples of adapting literary works for the screen.This is not to discount the contribution of Gary Sinise. Director Sinise and Actor Sinise were admirable. The former brought out the finest in the latter. This is Sinise's finest performance.Malkovich is a talented actor--he commands attention. Whether a more restrained performance was called for or not is debatable.Equally stunning is the film's music by Mark Isham--the man who grabbed my attention in Never Cry Wolf, Mrs Soffel and A Midnight Clear. Sinise was wise using the music effectively when required and not overdoing it to evoke pathos. The music doesn't sooth you, it nudges you to reflect on life.The film is a great essay on loneliness. Most importantly, it is a great example of how a literary work ought to be adapted without changing the author's vision. Remarkably, the film added more to Steinbeck's work with the train ride and the bus ride. That's Foote!

All that work, the craft, sweat and tears it took for him to create her, mutilated for the sake of profit.But this is nothing new. Every stage and screen interpretation of OMM has done the same thing. Why? Money, of course. Women make up the majority of moviegoers (and an even larger majority of movie-going decision-making). What producer has the courage to offend a predominately female audience?Well, American BEAUTY didn't do so badly.It is well known that Elaine Steinbeck lobbied John to allow the Curley's wife character to be softened. She was trained in theater. She wanted the stage and film versions to be a success.Well, just once I'd like to see Curley's wife depicted just as John created her.

Because of its simple nature, many people don't look at it with a very broad focus. But who could blame them? It's a pamphlet at a little more than a hundred pages and doesn't boast its explicit and controversial nature. The novel is basically reiterating Steinbeck's biased opinions of communism and how the common-man will never succeed because of roadside distractions.This marks the third time this book has been adapted into a film, and the first time one has went theatrical. Gary Sinise's direction utilizes the ranch scenery not as a backdrop or a postcard, but to enhance the film and its overall look. Every bit is utilized and the scenic shots never seem intrusive or unwelcome. Sinise's direction is complimented by the writing from the amazing Horton Foote, who also wrote the screenplay to the 1962 adaptation of Lee Harper's novel To Kill a Mockingbird. The script is done with piercing accuracy to its book counterpart and doesn't adds or subtract anything from the novel, leaving it as Sinise's original intentions.The story is simplicity itself following the lives of charismatic and intelligent George (Sinise) and strong but slow Lennie (Malkovich) who are wonderful when side-by-side but incomplete on their own. It's The Great Depression era where everything comes in limits, and George and Lennie are migrant workers traveling from ranch to ranch seeking any kind of work and pay.They stumble upon Tyler Ranch, where they run into a barrage of unique characters like the elderly ranch-hand Candy (Walston), the pugnacious and easily-provoked tough guy Curley (Siemaszko) and his skimpy wife (Fenn) who remains nameless like in the novel. Soft-spoken Slim (Terry), blunt and confident Carlson (Riehle), and the hunchback stable-buck Crooks (Morton).George and Lennie desire to fulfill their simple goal of owning a farm, a home, chickens, and don't forget the rabbits Lennie so eagerly anticipates. But financial and social setbacks have been coming in their path left and right. They work their feet into the ground to be rewarded with aches and trouble, which is what The Great Depression era was mainly composed of.Gary Sinise plays an amazing George, and John Malkovich tackles the difficult role of Lennie efficiently. It's very challenging to put yourself into a character who isn't all there but isn't entirely what people would consider normal. Malkovich's physical appearance is pitch perfect, but he shows a struggle to remain in character and in his boundaries at times. The supporting cast is fantastic, especially Ray Walston as Candy and Sherilyn Fenn as Curley's wife.Like I stated before, the dialog is so on-par with Steinbeck's original masterpiece it's astounding. When comparing any movie to a book, people usually utter the misleading phrase the movie wasn't as good as the book. You're comparing two different beasts. A film can never be all of the book, and what they did to Of Mice and Men was truly an amazement. They managed to create a film that left in mostly all of the subtleties of the original novel. Not only is it a rarity, but it's a true sign of respect for original source material.When George and Lennie talk to each other an on-screen spark ignites. The two characters, even in the novel, had inseparable chemistry together and it's incredibly difficult not to feel some emotion for them after the long road they've been on.Of Mice and Men is an extraordinary book and a film full of grace and charisma. It provided me with one of the more joyous experiences from such a sad film mainly because the actors are all blessed with beautifully written material and engulfing scenery. But I guess the real question we're left with is who is going to live off the fatta the land and tend all of those rabbits. Perhaps George will know the answer.Starring Gary Sinise, John Malkovich, Ray Walston, Casey Siemaszko, Sherilyn Fenn, John Terry, Richard Riehle, Joe Morton, and Noble Willingham.

Someone else has mentioned, however, that Malkovich doesn't seem quite right as the big lunk-head. He's too intelligent, and it's permanently distracting to watch him act dumb. This Lennie just isn't fully credible, and I kept catching myself distancing myself from the performance, watching it in a sort of bemused way. What was this man's mental age meant to be? I have a six year old grandson who is way brighter Lennie seemed to have a mental age of about 2 and a half. At the same time it was all too obvious that Malkovich has an IQ well above average. He was just pretending, and that's not good acting. Also, I don't believe he's really that big and strong, and I kept asking myself how the visual appearance was being manipulated. I just knew he didn't have the strength not to know what it was. It was not convincing, though I can't think who would have been better. Primo Carnera would have been good, but he wasn't available.

Brilliantly evoking time and place, Steinbeck masterfully recounted the tragic tale of George and Lennie, two friends who travel together and look out for each other during the Great Depression.Two-time director Gary Sinise (most popularly known for his memorable supporting role in 1994's 'Forrest Gump') has stated that 'Of Mice and Men' is his all-time favourite novel, and that he'd always wanted to adapt it to the screen. Sinise's respect for the work is clearly evident throughout the film, and screenwriter Horton Foote doesn't stray too far from the original story, nor does he overlook many vital plot points.George Milton (Gary Sinise) is a small but quick-witted farm labourer. He'd be doing considerably well for himself, but for his self-appointed obligation to look after Lennie Small (John Malkovich), a slow-minded giant. Lennie is a fine worker, but his insatiable, child-like curiosity often gets him into trouble, especially when he underestimates him own strength. After Lennie unintentionally harasses a women (because he was compelled to feel her beautiful red dress), he and George escape persecution and strike out &#150; yet again &#150; for new employment.Their search leads them to the Tyler Ranch, where they meet up with a whole new range of diverse characters, including the withered, one-handed old swamper named Candy (Ray Walston) and his equally withered dog, the kind-hearted Slim (John Terry), the crooked-backed African American stable boy, Crooks (Joe Morton), the easily-aggravated boss' son, Curley (Casey Siemaszko) and Curley's lonely and largely-ignored wife, who symbolically remains unnamed (Sherilyn Fenn). Each of these characters is well-acted by a strong supporting cast, and each of their qualities contribute significantly to the richness of the story.George often speaks about how Lennie is holding him back, but we can see that he generally enjoys his company. On most nights, Lennie insists that George recite a well-rehearsed speech about how lucky they are to have each other, culminating in a brilliantly evocative description of the little house and a couple of acres they are to purchase, in which they live off the fatta the land and Lennie will tend to the rabbits by feeding them freshly-grown alfalfa.Guys like us that work on ranches are the loneliest guys in the world... They ain't got no family and they don't belong no place. They got nothing' to look ahead to... Well, we ain't like that. We got a future. We got somebody to talk to that gives a damn about us. If them other guys gets in jail they can rot for all anybody cares.But not us, George, because I... see, I got you look after me, but you got me look after you.This is one of the most beautiful and touching friendships ever committed to screen, and we can almost see them succeeding in their goal, tending to their own farms as free men. Alas, John Steinbeck was not a writer known for his happy endings, and his heartbreaking conclusion has been translated well into the film. But perhaps the ending was slightly more optimistic than we initially think. They may not achieve their dream of living together on their own property, but neither of them have anything more to worry them. And that's all they really wanted.

We'd do anything for each other just like George would do for Lennie.The performances are jaw dropping good and I loved Gary Senise as George and John Malkovich as Lennie. You know that they started out in the Chicago theaters together first? Sorry, my Chicago pride slips in sometimes. John does something a little different with Lennie from the original black and white version and gives him more of a disgruntled voice with a lisp that sounds close to a child's. In some ways that was a good idea, because Lennie thinks like a child in some ways. But it wasn't that needed, Lennie was just a mentally challenged man, not speeched impaired.The plot is that Lennie and George are always on the run. Lennie always gets George in trouble because Lennie just doesn't know any better. Even though Lennie doesn't give George a break on life, you can tell he cares for him deeply and takes care of him. They go to a farm that is owned by Curly, played by Casey Siemaszko, to work for money and a place to live. They make friends with an elderly man, Candy who isn't well respected. He has an old dog with him that everyone is telling him to shoot because he's getting to old, and this was symbolic of what Candy was feeling, like just because the dog's old and useless, they should just get rid of him. When George, Lennie, and Candy are talking one night they talk about their dreams of going away to a potato field with rabbits for Lennie. This is it, they are going to go live their dreams. But when a flirty girl who happens to be Curly's wife keeps on going around the boys, she happens go to Lennie next where something terrible happens leading Lennie and George on the run again to an extremely powerful ending.This is a great movie and should be shown to everyone. I'm very serious on that because it has such a powerful message of strong friendship and loyalty. There are great performances and a great setting. I think John Steinbeck would be proud! 10/10 "},{"Title":"Of men and pain","Date":"12 October 2005","Score":"2 out of 3 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama","Review":" John Steinbeck's depression-era story of decent George and his dumb friend Lenny is one of those tales almost too heartbreaking to bear a re-telling a tragedy, in retrospect, of utter inevitability. Neither of its heroes have a malicious bone in their bodies, nor does their nasty boss Curly have any hope of moral redemption. This adds to the force of the ending, but also reduces the subtlety of the journey to reach it. But this is a decent adaptation and Gary Sinise and John Malkovich as the two men both put in good performances. I particularly like the way the camera picks out the whites of Sinise's eyes, which seems to emphasise the fact that this is a man committed to permanent, though ultimately fruitless, vigilance. But overall, there's a little too much unremittable pain to make watching 'Of Mice and Men' an entirely entertaining experience; you'll probably enjoy it more if you don't already know the story.

I've never found a book I enjoyed, but Steinbecks Of Mice and Men was something I really couldn't find myself putting down. It was incredibly entertaining from cover to cover. I actually cared for George and Lennie. Now the movie...It really wasn't half bad. I usually only enjoy comedy films, so sitting through this one does say something. Sinise was very good at George. Malkovich was also very good as Lennie. Now, people in other comments complain about Malkovich. I really didn't like how Lennie was seen in the film, but Malkovich is not at fault for that. I really doubt he wasn't told to act like he had Downs or something like that, so when you consider how real it was seeing act as if he had downs, he really was great in this film. Anyways...I really thought of Lennie as a normal guy just very slow, not stuttering and childish sounding. Another gripe of the film I have was Curley's wife. I understand that they couldn't have the scene with Crooks and her saying she'd get him hanged because people nowadays would have a cow over it, but something could have been a substitute for that. I feel Steinbeck really didn't want readers to know if they should feel bad for Curley's wife or hate her guts, but in the movie there really wasn't anything to hate her for. I think the friendship of George and Lennie could have been shown more. Sure, they talk about George and Lennie being different having eachother and all, but it really was a big deal in those times to have someone by your side like they did, but the film kinda played it off into more of a 'George takes care of Lennie' type thingAll in all, I must say the movie wasn't half bad.

Sinise plays George, a man living in California during the 1930's Great Depression. George is a homeless man that goes from job to job trying to earn any scrap of money to survive. However, George's situation is a little different than most; he travels with a close friend with a mental disorder named Lennie (John Malkovich). George and Lennie eventually come to work at a ranch, and that's where our story starts.I watched this film very soon after finishing the novel, and was pleasantly surprised. I was expecting for this movie to be awful, but it was actually pretty good. Most of the acting was nice, the direction was good, and the script was actually really great. Most of the lines in the script were either taken straight from the book, or were very close to it. Of Mice and Men was a pretty good movie, and I quite enjoyed it.The best thing about this film adaptation was the script, like mentioned above. The script was very faithful to the novel, and many lines were exact copies of what John Steinbeck, the author of the book, wrote. The book being only around 100 pages, the film knew it was going to have to lengthen itself, and it did so very well. The scenes added were pretty insignificant, and were mostly time fillers, as they should have been. The script did just about everything right, and I really liked that aspect of the film.Another pretty nice thing about Of Mice and Men was the acting. Gary Sinise was a perfect casting choice as George, and played the role nicely. All of the smaller actors, such as Ray Walston as Candy, were good as well. Most of the acting was really good all throughout the movie. Now, John Malkovich was good as Lennie, but played the role of a man with mental issues a bit too well. Although he wasn't bad by any means, he went a little overboard with his performance. When reading the novel, it was quite obvious that Lennie had issues, but he still seemed like he could at least hide his problems, as he does in the book. However, John Malkovich's performance showed him as a man beyond even recognition. His performance, while decent, went a bit farther than I feel that it should have.Gary Sinise, while great as George, also did great behind the camera as the director. All of the shots taken were pretty nice, and all of the camera angles were really good. Many of the takes were longer, and there were no quick cuts at all. However, I did have a complaint that was mostly with the direction, and that was the suspense build up. Although the direction was good, tension wasn't present very often. There were only two points throughout the film that I felt suspense, and that was because I had already read the book and knew what was about to happen. With my prior knowledge of the major plot points, I felt suspense. However, if I hadn't already have known the next big event in the story, then I don't think that I would've felt the tension almost at all.Of Mice and Men was overall a decent movie, and respected the novel. The script was great, the direction was fine, and most of the acting was good. I'd recommend Of Mice and Men to anyone who's read the book and enjoyed it.

They get a gig at a big ranch while dreaming of owning their own one day when the opportunity suddenly presents itself. Unfortunately, the arrogant son of the owner, Curley (Casey Siemaszko), and his flirtatious wife (Sherilyn Fenn) complicate matters. John Terry is on hand as Slim, Ray Walston plays Candy and Joe Morton plays Crooks.I've been a fan of this potent Western drama/tragedy ever since I read the book as a teenager and both this version and the 1992 version are worthy film adaptions (I have yet to see the 1981 TV production with Robert Blake and Randy Quaid, which I've heard is good). It seems that you just cannot do a 'bad' Of Mice and Men, as long as you have decent actors and filmmakers.Some people scoff at the moral of the story, as if it all comes down to shooting your aged, useless dog yourself, but it's way more than this. It's a commentary on the nature of companionship and loneliness Whereas George and Lennie compliment each other many of the other characters languish in isolation, like Candy, Curley's wife and Crooks, even Slim. Questions of strength, weakness, usefulness, reality and utopia are explored as the story leaves you scratching your head.Comparing the two versions, I slightly prefer the newer rendition because it's in color and is just overall better made with a superior score and cast with the exception of Lon Chaney as Lennie. Malkovich is very effective in the more recent version, but Chaney's Lennie is just more likable. While I don't like the addition of cussing in the 1992 rendition, it's probably more realistic and it isn't so bad that it makes the movie unwatchable (for me anyway). In any case, Sherilyn Fenn is a vast improvement over the original's Betty Field, who's annoying and not desirable enough to pull off the part (but, then again, she might be desirable to male ranch hands with no other females within a dozen miles).The film runs 115 minutes and was shot in California.GRADE A- COMMENTARY ***SPOILER ALERT*** (Don't read further unless you know the story) Curley's wife has only ever been valued for her sexuality, which she has learned to use to attract attention. Not only is she the only female character, she's also the only character not to be given a name in the book and the 1992 version, which emphasizes that she's a sexual plaything, currently owned by Curley. She was repressed by her mother and taken advantage of by men who made her empty promises. She prefers to believe that her mother stole her letters from the Hollywood man who used her, instead of accepting reality. She is married to a boor who places little value on her and so she seeks the only attention she can get from the men on the ranch as the only woman there sexual attention. The contact with Lennie in the barn is as far as sexual as it gets. When she says It feels good to have her hair stroked, she isn't speaking sexually. She is enjoying the only nonsexual attention and affectionate touch she has had in a very long time, if ever. It is almost a meeting of children between this woman who long ago lost her sexual innocence but remains hopelessly naïve, and Lennie, who also longs for soft things in his life. It is a beautiful, tragic scene.Someone argued that Curley's wife wanted to get Lennie on her side so that he would kill Curley and she would be free to leave. If Lennie killed him, no one would believe him if he ever said that she told him to do it; and since she didn't do the deed herself, she could easily leave and start her life over, hopefully as a movie star. While an interesting theory, the young woman doesn't come across this devious or cunning in the story where her actions are more natural and naïve. Similar to Lennie, she was a child in an adult body, albeit not mentally challenged. She was starving for companionship, but none of the other men would hang out with her due to Curley and the threat of losing their job. Lennie was alone in the barn and so she just took advantage of the occasion to converse with someone. Add to this the fact that Lennie was the only man on the ranch to humble (conquer) her arrogant SOB husband, whom she hated. Plus, she noticed earlier how Lennie appraised her with obvious awe. So there was a subconscious attraction and she wanted the gentle giant to touch her, stroke her hair; perhaps to reward him.

As a rebellious 15 year old, the film did not sound particularly appealing to me and I was convinced that within two minutes my concentration would start to drift elsewhere. However, to my surprise it turned to be a worthwhile and gripping venture, well served by its cast.Though not a fan of John Malkovich, or of Gary Sinise ( who also produced and directed the movie ), I liked the movie because of its heartwarming storyline, its thoughtful pace and grittiness.Based on the 1937 novel by John Steinbeck, this 1992 film adaption ( adapted by Horton Foote ) follows the lives of two men - George Milton and his mentally handicapped friend Lennie Small. The two have recently had to flee from their previous employment in California after Lennie was falsely accused of rape ( all he did was touch a woman's dress as he has a liking for stroking soft things ). Eventually, the two secure a job at Tyler ranch. Ranch hand Candy ( Ray Walston ) seems to take a shine to them, but Candy's son Curley ( Casey Siemaszko ) dislikes them on sight.The dislike soon turns to hatred when Lennie accidentally kills Curley's floozy of a wife ( Sherilyn Finn ) when whilst stroking her hair he accidentally grips too hard and ends up breaking her neck ( Lennie has no concept of how strong he is ). Angered by this, Curley rounds up a group of men with the intent on lynching Lennie. In a bid to spare Lennie from a slow, agonising death, George takes Lennie to a private spot in the countryside and distracts Lennie by talking to him about their dream of owning a ranch together before reluctantly shooting him in the back of the head.As the film ended, we had the boys of my class being too busy either sticking chewing gum under the chairs or engraving graffiti on the desks to take any notice of the film and we had the girls of my class crying their eyes out. I did not fall into either category. I sat there cool as a cucumber, feeling a strange sensation in the pit of my stomach ( it could have been indigestion from that day's school dinner ).The scene in which Candy's beloved but severely crippled sheep dog has to be anaesthetised, much to Candy's upset, I find a deeply affecting moment. It was about 14 years ago that my first dog ( who, if you can believe it, went by the name of Hannibal ) was put to sleep after losing his ability to see or walk. Even now, I still haven't entirely gotten over losing him so I know only too well the pain Candy must have been feeling.As another poster has said about this film, do not be afraid to show your emotions whilst watching it. Just sit with a box of tissues at the ready and let your emotions loose.

How about The Grapes Of Wrath? Based upon the darkest of Steinbeck's novels, the movie follows George and Lenny as they travel looking for field jobs during the depression. Lenny is severely mentally disabled with almost superhuman strength that causes him to hurt or kill those he tries to love. When the movie begins, we see them hiding from another angry mob pursuing Lenny. Steinbeck focuses on the destruction of the old, beautiful or used up in this great work. When they come upon the next work site, the ingredients for the final tragedy are all there. A sadistic owner's son with a wayward wife, bored out of her mind on the farm, who takes a tragic interest in Lenny. Even here, at the beginning, George is seriously thinking about getting out of his relationship of paternal care for Lenny. Yet, they have this dream about the farm with the animals they will raise that sustains all their trials and flights together. I love the original version, with Burgess Meredith, but truly, the acting here is far superior than the black and white original. Steinbeck has a parallel story to the George / Lenny dyad with Candy, well played by Walston, and his old broken down dog. The foreman and the men harass Candy to let them shoot his old dog that can barely walk. Candy, fearing for his job, agrees but immediately recants but it is too late. We see Candy curl up in his bunk,I wish someone would take me out and shoot me. What makes this the hardest to endure is that we have this terrible sense of foreboding when you watch it. We already saw Curly, the cruel bosses' son, get every bone in his hands crushed when he tried attacking Lenny. The little puppy also is crushed to death. George tries to keep Lenny away from Curly's wife but he can't watch him every minute. The sadness comes from, not just the horrible ending, but the dream that Candy even latches onto. This dream of transcendence over being worked to death until you have no value left in your body, gives them a spark of hope. Grapes was dark also but it ends on a hopeful note of the family reaching California and we sense things will go better. SPOILER Here we last see George alone on a train; his haunted eyes filled with the anguish of what he had to do. Steinbeck shows you a duty of basic compassion that soldiers have to do everyday. George has this terrible moral choice Destroy Lenny quickly and compassionately or let the mob get him. The best scene is where he tells Lenny to look over at the stream and he talks about the bunnies; George then mercifully shoots Lenny. The movie is in my inventory because, if you are very unfortunate in your life, you may have to make this horrendous decision. As Nietzsche was fond of pointing out, not all Truth is pleasant. This movie exemplifies that axiom. It is the best adaptation both for the photography and the two great performances. Malkovich never gave a better reading in his life. Yes, the plans of mice and men don't amount to much in this cruel world. Like the genial Nazi in Lifeboat, drowning Bendix with his amputated leg, then rowing away as he screams and the others sleep, this is not a pleasant movie to watch. I love Grapes but this I consider to be the best adaptation of Steinbeck featuring two great performances. Truthfully, like The Mission, I own it but I do not watch it often. It still is worth watching to prepare you for the horrible moral choices that some people make every day. It is a tragic truth that sometimes death can be a much more compassionate choice than life. Studying hard ethical situations is good for one's brain one never knows what is around the corner. An Excellent Movie.

There are other important characters, such as Candy (Ray Waltson) or Curley (Casey Siemaszko). I think this film is really successful, as it represents really well most of the scenes from and the book, although the characters wasn't the same as it was described in the book. In the film, John Malkovich was ideal for the role of Lennie Small. This character in particular stood out because he acted the same as the book. In the book this character was just like a baby, while in the film it represented identically. I the film we can see Lennie as a strong man but acting as a child of 7-8 years old. The character George Milton played by Gary Sinise had an excellent throughout too because he was just the same as in the book, acting as Lennie's father. I think the best part in the middle of the film, where we can see that George and Lennie has settled in the ranch and Lennie was having fun with his new puppy. The film was different to the novel, as it didn't have the same beginning and final as the book. In the book it began when George and Lennie was in their way to their new ranch and it ended when Candy called George to go for a drink after killing Lennie, and in the film it began when Lennie got into trouble in the last ranch and finished when George killed Lennie and left the ranch. The film was really entertaining, as the music effects were set very good. The worse part of the film was when kill Lennie, because I don't think killing Lennie was the best idea. Also I think Curley's wife wasn't acting as well, because in the book she an unkind woman. I think they should also have changed a bit the final and not just finished with George leaving the ranch. In conclusion the film is really good and interesting. I think everyone who are learning American history in the 20th century or interested in it, they should watch this film, but also I recommend this film to everyone, as it is excellent. I would give the film 5 stars out of 5! "},{"Title":"What Makes A Great Film? Of Mice and Men","Date":"6 April 2011","Score":"","Genre":"Drama","Review":" John Steinbeck's novella Of Mice and Men has been successfully transformed into a wonderful film. Gary Senise masterfully directs this tale of two men in search of the American Dream. This movie is a must see because of its rich plot and talented cast who successfully and realistically portray the characters from the book, creating many feelings in the viewers as they watch the movie.The actors are perfectly casted. They successfully and realistically portray the characters from the book. John Malkovich, who played Lennie Smalls is one of the most believable characters in the film. Lennie has the mind of a child and is mentally challenged, and Malkovich completely pulled it off. Also the facial expressions he made were very convincing. When he broke Curley's hand you could see that sense of anger in his eyes, like he truly did want to hurt him. Another character that was convincing was Curley's wife. Curley's wife was constantly flirting with other guy. In the film the director made Curley's wife very attractive, because she was a flirt. She was always with other guys even when she was told not to be by Curley. Her voice was high and it sounded nice and innocent. She fooled all the guys on the farm that she saw, when she said that she was lonely. She had a husband but did not care about him, so she never talked to him. If she talked to him she would not have been so lonely. Sherilyn Fenn's cogent acting made viewers believe that she really was Curley's wife. One other character that did a great performing job was Gary Sinise as George. Throughout the entire movie George showed his love to Lennie; although they fought sometimes, the viewers still knew that he loved him. The two actors were very compatible together. Viewers could see the chemistry between the two actors. Viewers could see the chemistry by how they acted in scenes, their facial expressions and the way they talked to each other. The ending is when you truly knew that he cared. Just before George was about to shoot Lennie he put his head on Lennie's shoulder. This action showed the viewers that he didn't want to shoot him but he had to to protect Lennie from a painful death. As the public watch the film you begin to feel a sense of different emotions as each scene goes by. Although the moviegoers know what is going to happen viewers still feel apprehensiveness, sadness and anger, because the event is not going to obviate from happening. When Curley's wife walks into the barn viewers begin to feel nervous and anxious because they know that Lennie is going to kill her, and they want to see how it is portrayed in the movie when viewers are actually watching it instead of just reading what is written down on paper. People can get the effect of how Senise saw the scene, and the difference from the way the viewers pictured the scene.Another emotion you begin to feel is anger when Carlson shoots Candy's dog. You know that dog is going to die, but patrons get angry because they do not understand why the dog has to die. It's so cute and innocent. You wait for the gunshot to be heard and you wish that it did not have to happen. At the end of the movie when George puts his head on Lennie's shoulder, viewers know that he is going to kill him. Viewers feel sad because they feel bad for Lennie and they also feel heartbroken for George because he truly loves him and to lose a loved one is the worst feeling in the world. The Of Mice and Men film should be recommended to anyone who loves a good story about the true meaning of friendship. The actors, director and the emotions viewers feel, truly make this movie number one. Viewers should commend Senise's adaptation of the film.

Therefore, I can't comment on this as an adaptation of the source material. This is one of the only films that Sinise has directed, and I certainly see reason to give him more chances to do so. The plot is great, and though you can sort of figure out fairly early whether or not it will have a happy ending, it still holds surprises. This is about the lowest in society, and the lack of chances and tolerance that they must endure. The acting is excellent, although I understand that while Malkovich's performance makes Lennie come off as retarded, he was not as mentally debilitated in the book. With that said, he gives the role the gentle innocence that it needs. Every part is well-cast. The cinematography and editing are nice without drawing attention to themselves, and the well-written characters are what drive the compelling story forward. There is a little violence and disturbing content in this, some of it strong.

"},{"Title":"Fine adaptation that thrills and shocks consistently","Date":"6 March 2009","Score":"","Genre":"Drama","Review":" Lennie (Malkovich) and George (Sinise) head to a ranch to carry out work with a dream of one day owning their own land.Based on John Steinbeck's novel, Of Mice and Men is one of the classic dramas that creates controversy through a widespread use of real life difficult issues and is no surprise that it is of frequent use in English GCSEs. Written in a highly scripted and imaginative way with humour, drama and adventure, this is a timeless piece of literature that will go on and on and recall issues that were present in the depression that are remerging in recent times with the credit crunch and lack of work and money in particular. Opening with a woman running away we see Lennie and George also running away and this slow motion montage juxtaposed with the light score brings you into a trance like state as the characters make their way out of hiding and off to work. Lack of jobs, taking whatever work is offered, little money and no place today might sound like a description of this past year but here we see how it was equally difficult in the depression. It is through George that we get a real sense of how things have been. George is a negative middle aged guy wanting to settle down and has a burden to bear with Lennie. Lennie's child like manner has him an outcast from places and when reaching the ranch we see how Lennie is an instant outcast with his way of being. But through George we see how tolerable he really is and how the lack of work and life changes can affect the human spirit.Of Mice and Men is more than just a drama however. The symbol of appearances, the use of money, the good nature of strangers and the importance of friendship are all covered. Again all issues that are still present in today's culture that is all relative. Malkovich and Sinise give great performances and it is down to the script that makes the stars shine in the way they do with particular moments such as Lennie's animal loving in particular mesmerizing.Sinise's artistic direction works wonders with the motions of the story. Of Mice and Men is a fine adaptation that lacks only on the odd turn but thrills, spills and shocks on a consistent basis and with the multitude of life problems, this is a fine preaching drama "},{"Title":"Excellent adaptation","Date":"6 December 2008","Score":"","Genre":"Drama","Review":" When I read the book Of Mice and of Men, I found it difficult to be drawn into the characters. It's not that I don't understand the historical context - my parents are children of the Depression. I just didn't find George & Lenny believable. The tremendous performances of Malkovich & Sinese solved this for me. They were utterly believable and both did marvelous jobs interpreting their characters. Clearly, Gary Sinese did a great job with the direction. In addition to making the characters believable, he was able to play the movie out with a very deliberate pace. Like a car wreck that takes place in slow motion, the movie proceeds at a snail's pace through the few days from George & Lenny's arrival until the finale. The cinematography is visually enchanting, and reinforced the sense of the importance of things other than wealth - natural beauty, good friends, a hard day's work well done. I highly recommend this movie. "},{"Title":"Of Mice and Movie-making","Date":"29 May 2008","Score":"","Genre":"Drama","Review":" If Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull were a book, with a page that described Shia LeBeouf's character swinging in trees with monkeys, it would be much more boring than actually seeing it. Even though that was a goofy scene, it added visuals that were needed to make the adventure more dramatic. Movies give audiences a perspective of the story that books only let them imagine. In the film Of Mice and Men, director Gary Sinese did a good job making viewers want to see, rather than just read about, what would happen next. The filmmakers changed sequences from Steinbeck's book to make the story more cinematic, but did not alter the themes of the original novel. This is apparent in the characters' transportation to the ranch, the scene in Crooks's barn, and George's attempt to fit the horse with a new shoe.Instead of using the long bus scene from the opening of the book, the filmmakers had the characters switch modes of transportation from train to bus to foot. The first thing the reader learns about how the characters arrived in town is George's line We could just as well of rode clear to the ranch if that bastard bus driver knew what he was talking' 'bout (5.) This is different from the movie, in which the characters start on a train, and then transfer onto a bus, and then walk. As they travel, we see an old-fashioned town, a gas station, and the land surrounding the farm. The filmmakers made a bus ride that was only spoken about in the book into three actual, separate events. This is appropriate for a movie in order to keep the viewers' attention. Movies should show more visual detail than books, and the inclusion of the small town and the speeding train make the scene more cinematic. The filmmakers do not, however, change the original purpose of the scene, which is to show how difficult it is to travel with Lenny.Instead of staging the long conversation in Crooks's barn between Lenny, Crooks, Candy, and Curley's wife from the book, the filmmakers created a number of different scenes in different places. For example, the dialogue where Curley's wife asks, Say, what happened to Curley's han'? takes place later, while George, Lenny, and Slim are farming, in the movie (76.) The filmmakers separated the barn scene into four different parts because they didn't want too many questions to be asked and answered at once. This is more cinematic because without the consistent change of setting and actors, the audience will get bored. It's easier to read one long scene in a book because the author will not have to continually re-describe new settings. The director showed the same themes of loneliness through Curley's wife and friendship through Lenny's obedience of George by keeping Steinbeck's dialogue even though he split the scenes up.The scene is which George takes Slim's horse to be fitted for a new shoe, which was not in the book, helps to visually describe George's dislike for Curley's wife. In the book, the reader only learns about George's feelings toward Curley's wife through lines like Lenny's George said I ain't to have nothing' to do with you, talk to you or nothing' (84.) We can infer that George doesn't like her because she always gets men in trouble. If Curley sees a man near her, he gets angrier than he already is. This is shown differently in the movie, in the barn scene where Curley's wife actually tries to talk to George and he turns his back on her. By adding this scene, the filmmakers made the movie more cinematic because they allowed the audience to actually see this conflict instead of just reading about and visualizing it. In the novel, women bring bad news when they get mixed up with men. This theme has not changed in the movie even though the director has invented a new scene.By keeping the original themes of Of Mice and Men and making the sequences more cinematic for the viewers, the filmmakers created a great movie. The different methods of transportation, the added scenes in the barn sequence, and the meeting between George and Curley's wife make the movie more entertaining rather that a montage of long, boring moments. Making a good movie out of a book is not easy, and adding extra scenes without destroying the main theme is even tougher. In this movie, the filmmakers did a great job of preserving Steinbeck's ideas even though they changed the details.

That being said, I was pleasantly surprised by the casting, directing, and content of this movie. The story held true to John Steinbeck's original work down to much of the dialog. The film elicited the same emotions I felt when I first read the book as a child.John Malkovich's portrayal of Lenny was at times seemingly forced, but it worked well even if it was not consistent with the novel. I also envisioned Lenny as a much larger individual, given his enormous strength. However, Malcovich's acting abilities trumped these minor shortcomings and the integrity of the film was not at all jeopardized. "},{"Title":"One change (for the better) from the novel","Date":"14 May 2007","Score":"","Genre":"Drama","Review":" It's true that the film follows the novel very faithfully, with the exception of a few details at the end. For me, the slightly revised ending is even more powerful than Steinbeck's original.Steinbeck wrote both novel and stage-play versions of OF MICE AND MEN at about the same time (ca. 1937), and it always seemed to me that the ending, in which the posse shows up after George shoots Lennie (You hadda, George, you hadda), was a device to get George off the stage at the end of the show. In Sinise's film, the posse never shows. Instead, the scene of George expressing his anguish over what he has just done dissolves into a shot of him riding the train. It's a more effective way of underscoring how alone in the world George is now.As a side note, it's a shame this film wasn't more popular when released in '92. Although the entire cast was superb, Ray Walston deserved an Oscar nomination for best supporting actor. He might not have won against the likes of Hackman, Nicholson, and Pacino (three names you'd not expect to find in the supporting-actor category in the same year), but he deserved a nomination at the very least.

And you know what, you're absolutely right. It's the simplicity of this story that makes everything so heart-warming. Steinbeck did a superb job portraying one of the human race's biggest weaknesses, how we all wish to love and be loved, and how holding onto those we cherish is just so darn hard. Even in the film it was beautifully done, I especially love the way John Malkovich did the voice of Lennie, childish and half-witted.

"},{"Title":"A beautiful and emotional movie.","Date":"6 November 2006","Score":"","Genre":"Drama","Review":" The film Of mice and Men has brought to life the book by John Steinbeck. The scenery was beautiful and it enhanced what was in the book dramatically. The case was exactly the sane for the ranch that Lennie and George work on- crafted precisely the way it should be.When it comes to characters, some had major character aspects left out. For example Curley's wife at one point racially discriminates against Crooks (or stable buck) within the book. But within the film this important part is left out. Having this taken away left the character Crooks having no point being within the film. The film shows how others discriminate against women, the disabled, the old, but decides to leave out racial discrimination.Also the first time I watched the film, I felt that Lennie (played by John Malkovich) was cast wrongly. The appearance chosen for him strayed very far from my imagination (having read the book first). But now looking back it was an excellent choice. This just made it clearer that Lennie is mentally a little boy but physically he is stuck in a grown mans body.The acting by Gary Sinise (who played George) truly breathtaking. The acting between him and John Malkovich flowed naturally. Gary Sinise was also the director for the movie and did an excellent job as both.This is truly a beautiful movie. I recommend it to teenagers up!

I find most books that are turned into movies are not as effective in the form of film because they were not written as such. 'Of Mice and Men' was an outstanding movie. I believe that the reason for it's success in such a variety of medias is not because of the content of the original story but rather the director and writers modification of the content. I thought that certain deletions and additions are what really helped the book translate so simply into a movie. In particular, the addition of the series of scenes in the beginning of the movie helped give the characters much more definition before the plot line of the book had actually begun. This was a necessary and very well calculated change because unlike the book where Steinbeck was able to show the characters personalities through narration, the movie had no such element that could describe outside of the literal visual events and dialogue. To make up for this lack of dimensions the movie added the events preceding the book more to allow you to understand the characters then anything else. The acting in this movie was another element that really allowed it to be carried out so well. The actors showed the emotions almost exactly as they were written, and so it was easy to understand what was going on. John Malkovich played Lennie with such clarity that it was as easy to sympathize with his childish naiveté and unfortunate mistakes. Overall I thought this movie was an excellent adaptation of the book and I would rate it 4 out of 5 stars.-Dylan "},{"Title":"A Wonderful Experience","Date":"31 October 2006","Score":"","Genre":"Drama","Review":" Review Of The Film Of Mice And Men The movie was really well done and was well related to the book.

Lenny and George were two people that were inseparable and looked after each other. They were very wise in picking John Malcovich and Gary Senise to play Lenny and George.

They end up on the Tyler Ranch and meet many characters. As the movie goes on you get to find how George and Lenny came to be friends and how they lead up to where the movie starts. However, by the end of the movie, Lenny kills the wife of the son of the ranch and runs away. The last part of the movie was spectacular and gave me a tear in my eye.Both Gary Senise and John Malcovich gave each part of the movie so perfect and were very precise. They put so much emotion in their parts and it was as if I was there experiencing it for myself. Lenny was a part in the movie that showed so much passion and kindness toward George and it was not one time in the movie that he would hurt George. George was like a father figure toward Lenny and guided him throughout the whole movie.

I watched this movie for my English class and I feel it was a pretty good movie. Even though, some scenes were added and some scenes were inaccurate and moved too fast. For example, I was not happy that the director rushed the scene when George decided to shoot Lennie. In the book, George was really slow and precise about it. But in the movie, George starts telling Lennie about how they will live on their own farm and then picks up Carlson's gun and shots Lennie in the head. Also the movie didn't end the way the book ended with the men finding George and the dead Lennie and then tell George that he did the right thing. Instead, the movie ended with a flashback to when George and Lennie were working together. Other than some of the inaccuracies, it was a good movie that is a good supplement to reading the book.

Malkovich was superb in the role, and the chemistry between him and Sinise was sublime. I didn't think anyone could top Burgess Meredith and Lon Chaney Jr., but this film did. I was thrilled to see the way Sinise's direction of the film remained as true to the classic work of Steinbeck. Everyone played their part to the best of their ability, and it shows. Magnificent.

Just several weeks ago, still remembering the story very well, I finally watched the 1939 film for the first time, which is the first of two theatrically released adaptations of John Steinbeck's 1937 novella, and a very good one at that. I intended to watch this 1992 version (the second theatrical adaptation of the story) again after watching its predecessor, and that's what I did. Apparently, more than one TV adaptation was made in between these two films, and I haven't seen any of them, but I have now seen both theatrical versions, and even though one was made over fifty years after the other, they are both impressive.Lennie Small and George Milton are two ranch workers in Great Depression-era United States. Lennie is a mentally handicapped man of large stature and doesn't realize his own strength. He doesn't mean any harm, but still gets into a lot of trouble. George has to look after him and often has to get him out of trouble, and for this reason, they can't keep a job. They constantly have to move whenever Lennie gets in trouble and find work somewhere else, but the two of them dream of having their own house and acres of land. They find employment at Tyler Ranch, where they make friends with some of their co-workers, including an elderly man named Candy, but also face the ranch owner's mean-spirited son, Curley, who hates big guys like Lennie and has a neglected wife who is lonely and tries to be social, but George tells Lennie to stay away from her.The lead characters, Lennie and George, are played here by John Malkovich and Gary Sinise, and these two co-stars both really stand out, just like Lon Chaney Jr. and Burgess Meredith do in the 1939 version. Sinise also directed this film, and did a good job with that as well. Malkovich's portrayal of Lennie is very clearly different from that of Chaney, and some may criticize it for the stereotypical handicapped voice and such, but I would say both versions of the character are good in their own way, even if Chaney's is slightly better. One problem I found with this 1992 film is Sherilyn Fenn's portrayal of Curley's wife. I'm not sure exactly how to describe it, but it's slightly disappointing, and it seemed to me that the part where she is introduced could have been more focused. Betty Field's performance in this role in the first film is superior. However, most of the cast's performances here are still impressive, and as anyone who is familiar with the story would expect, this film is very poignant at times. I personally didn't find the part with Candy losing his dog as moving here as the way it was done in the first adaptation, but in the end, this second theatrical adaptation of the story basically leaves the viewer with the same emotions as the first one does.Which film is better, the 1939 version or this 1992 version? That's a tough call! Both films have their flaws, but are still very good and unforgettable, basically for the same reasons. They are also both very faithful to the book, even though they're obviously not exactly the same. The original adaptation of Steinbeck's classic MIGHT be better than this one by just a little bit, but if so, this film still comes VERY close to matching that one! It could have been far inferior, but fortunately, that didn't turn out to be the case. I wouldn't exactly call it a masterpiece, like some people do, but I think I can say it comes close, and I would describe its predecessor the same way. I don't know about the TV adaptations of Of Mice and Men, which obviously aren't as widely available as the two theatrically released ones, but if you're a fan of the book, I really think the 1939 and 1992 versions of the story are both worth viewing.

Mentally-disabled Lennie often poses a burden to George, a man with plans of establishing his own homestead, but loneliness holds them together.The film marks a rare directorial effort by Gary Sinise, who also played the part of George. The film has an attractive look but lacks any distinct artistic touch to elevate it much above average in terms of presentation. The score, by Mark Isham, is also ably handled but not particularly noteworthy.Sinise & John Malkovich turn in fine performances in reprisals of the roles that they'd played together in a 1980 stage production. The rest of the cast is filled out with some recognizable character actors, all of whom turn in workmanlike performances.In the end, though, I suppose that it's inevitable to compare the film to the novel upon which it's based. I originally saw the film years before I read the novel and then saw it again only recently. The film is quite faithful to the source material, which is refreshing. However, while the book is one of my favorites, the film doesn't reach quite the same heights in its respective field. Nevertheless, it's a worthwhile adaptation and certainly worth checking out for anyone interested in the story.

Of Mice and Men is a wonderful story about the troubles of two men in the early American time era. John Malkovich plays the main character Lennie perfectly. With his presence in the movie, it makes the whole thing enjoyable. He brings a different character and personality to the screen. Lennie has certain troubles, but his only wish is to have a pet, a rabbit maybe and a nice house to live. Gary Sinise plays the 2nd main character George. George protects Lennie. George and Lennie travel around together; thus begin the tales of their adventures. The movie itself also adds an extra scene that was not included the novel. Made in 1992, this movie previewed around the world, and is much loved. Of Mice and Men is used for school readings, colleges, and every day life. It is set in California around the Selenas and Sacramento. Steinbeck really produced a wonderful story about how two men bonded. I read the book then watched the movie. Often times you are disappointed by the movie, or notice a lot of things have been left out.Not for me though, this movie included every tiny detail. The characters were just like the characters in the novel I imagined. I'm sure if Steinbeck were alive right now, he'd be happy with this movie.

I watch the movie before reading the book. Far too many times have I gone to see a movie with someone and I loved the film and they hated it because it wasn't just like the book. So I saw this with my folks when I was 12 years old, because my parents had read the book. Not only was I hooked and fascinated by the movie, but it was also the first movie that I ever cried at. My parents loved it, I loved it and ever since then I have read the book, bought the book, and received the book on tape read by Gary Sinise himself for Christmas. Looking at all the negative reviews from people that think that this movie wasn't faithful to the story just baffles me. Gary Sinise, who acted and directed this, did an excellent job at portraying each character in the book both physically, and dramatically. It was the little details in the film that I found fascinating. After reading the book there was even a description of what George's character looked like, which depicted Sinise perfectly.I know the controversy as well on whether or not John Malcovich had portrayed Lenny correctly. Some feel that he looked and acted too mentally retarded for the role. But as I see it. If Lenny, the character was just merely a slow man, then why was he such a burden to George? Why was his tremendous strength such a danger? If he was just a regular ol'guy that wasn't too bright, then these things wouldn't have been such a problem. Portraying Lenny as a child trapped in an ox of a man's body makes sense, and therefore I thought Malcovich did a wonderful job. He is always over the top in every movie that he is in.Combined with the landscaping, and cinematography this movie is a pleasure to watch. It makes you laugh one minute, and then ripes your heart out the next. The inner turmoil that George faces between himself and the rest of the world is finely played, and I would recommend this movie to anyone, especially the people that have read the book. =o) "},{"Title":"Incredible....and Malkovich was PERFECT","Date":"14 June 2003","Score":"2 out of 4 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama","Review":"  A wonderful adaptation of Steinbeck's classic.

When George shoots Lennie at the end, it is shocking, and adds a twist to the whole story. The actors portrayed the characters very well, and Lennie is just as slow as I would have expected. George is just as harsh as I thought he would've been. While he is harsh however, he opens up to Lennie at the end and it is very similar to what he does in the book also. Also, the story line is the same as the book, and the books and movies don't seem like they make each other worse. Also, all of the characters represent their role in the book well. For instance, Slim is a hard-working boss, who seems to decently care for his workers. In the movie, this is exactly what is portrayed, and really adds to the quality of the Movie. The movie has it's sad points, and has a great variety. For instance, like I said before, when George shoots Lennie, it is both a major shock and a major disappointing point. Lennie was an easily lovable character, and to go out like that would be very harsh. Overall, this movie is a great one.

I never knew I would like this movie so much! It is a very emotional story, based on the novella of the same name by John Steinbeck. For Year 9 English, I had to read this book. I read it a couple of times before we started it in class and I didn't really like it. In fact, didn't like it at all. But as we discussed the book in class, I started to understand it more and like it better. After the class had finished reading the book, we would have to write an essay on it, we could take in half a page of quotes on it. Now I thought hell, I'm not reading it for the 4th time, so I thought I'd watch the movie. I am so glad I did. It is a great movie, the characters are PERFECT. George (Gary Sinise, was also one of the directors of the film) and Lennie (John Malkovich) were great as the two stars. The movie was put together really well. I loved it. Some people complain about the very few changes made, I think they were changed for the better (especially the ending). Some also complain about John Malkovich's acting, some say he is over reacting too much and also saw a review where someone said John is too 'intelligent' for the role. If that is the case, he is a damn good actor (as well as a 'damn good worker', says George). I think John pulled off Lennie's part splendidly. I could go on all day about how great this is, but I only have a 1000 word limit.The movie is pretty much the same as the book, with like I said, a few minor changes. (I ended up reading the book again, just in case) It is my new favourite movie and book surprisingly. It is very rare nowadays to find a movie with some sincere meaning, this is one of those rare movies. I would most definitely recommend this movie. But if you are into fancy effects, action and all that stuff, this is not for you. If you like an emotional, meaningful story of friendship, this is the movie to watch. So grab yourself some popcorn and sit down. If you are the type to get really emotional, have a box of tissues in reach, just in case. 10/10 for a beautiful story. I think Steinbeck would be proud.

Crooks, the crippled black stable hand. Everyone I've spoken with regarding the movie has,for the most part, had strong feelings of sympathy, even sorrow, toward Lenny regarding his mental faculties. Lennie, I think, although not what most folks would consider normal, actually had a pretty pleasant, happy life. Someone to take care of him, probably not a care in the world,he didn't really know any different. However,Crooks on the other hand, a crippled black man, with all, or at least most, of his faculties. Appeared to be average or above intelligence, lived in an isolated world. No one engaged him in conversation or dialog and was, as it appeared to me, actually shunned and left in a lonely world with just the one possibility of a friend to talk to, Lennie Small. Yet, even that was yanked from him. Just my own thoughts. The ending, flash back's of Lennie and George. Heartwarming, but I wonder if I might have ended it different?

Lennie, a huge, dopey, yet lovable man who does not know his own strength, played by Gary Sinise, and George, his guardian, played by John Malkovich, make John Steinbeck's Of Mice and Men come to life. The movie shows off the great acting skills of the cast, the wonderful scenes that the director created, and most of all, its well thought out poignant ending to make Steinbeck's story of George and Lennie a reality up on the big screen. Malkovich, who played Lennie, was a perfect fit. Lennie is written as a strong man that has the mind of a young child in Steinbeck's work, and is captured precisely in the movie. Malkovich's facial expressions and the way he delivers his lines is perfect in fulfilling Lennie's character as he acts juvenile and unaware of things going on around him, yet likable and humorous. After George lies to the farm owner by telling him that he is Lennies cousin, they leave the room and Lennie innocently tells George that they are not cousins, as if George does not know. George was obviously telling a lie to get both himself and Lennie a job on the farm. Gary Sinise also does a great job of acting out his parent like characteristics. Throughout the movie, George acts as a guardian by trying to keep Lennie out of trouble, by telling Lennie his favorite story of how the both of them will one day own their own plot of land and pet bunnies, and by rinsing Lennie's bloodied face after his fight with Curly, the farm owner's vindictive son. Lennie has a mental problem, and George, out of kindness, takes him under his wing. George's character is played flawlessly to show how much he really cares to parent Lennie.Interesting scenes that the director captured were Lennie and George walking to the farm for the first time, and Curly showing his anger toward Lennie when they first met. Lennie and George were shown as tiny dots as they walked along a single dirt road that brought them through the mountains of California. Them being surrounded by huge rocks suggests a theme of loneliness, while the town's name, Soledad, also implies. Loneliness is a central theme because all Lennie and George have throughout the movie is themselves. There are other acquaintances they encounter, but they always have each other deep in their hearts. The scene where Curly first meets Lennie, who has a smirk on his face, Curly becomes angry since Lennie is bigger than he is. Curly steps in between Lennie and George as he starts to harass Lennie. This foreshadows how Curly gets between George and Lennie in the end.Since Lennie accidentally killed Curly's wife, Curly seeks revenge and gathers everyone to help hunt him down. George is determined to find him first so that he can kill him himself. George has to kill Lennie himself because earlier in the book a character named Carlson and Slim persuade Candy to kill his dog for him since it was old and had problems. After Carlson killed Candy's dog, Candy said that he wished that he had killed his dog himself since he raised that dog from a pup and was so attached to it. This predicts the actions of George and why he has the desire to kill Lennie himself, and also since George knows Curly is going to kill him anyway if he doesn't first. Lennie was so deep into trouble this time that George was not able to get him out of it. This bittersweet moment was done perfectly since George knows he had to let him go. George told Lennie his favorite story for the last time, and killed him right after his favorite part; the bunnies they are going to own. Lennie dies happy, but most tragically, the strong friendship between Lennie and George get destroyed.The Of Mice and Men movie brings all of the thrills Steinbeck creates in his writing and is truly authentic to Steinbeck's work. From the actors, to the director and emotional ending, the Of Mice and Men movie honorably serves Steinbeck's classic story of the two drifters, George and Lennie, in the 1930's.

Ten years later I am still reading and re-reading his work. I had heard of the earlier version of this terrific story but was never inclined to literature of any substance. Then I read Of Mice and Men and it has been a life-changing experience. I never saw the Gary Sinise film at the cinemas over here in Oz, I don't actually recall it going to the cinemas. So when I stumbled across it in the video shop about 8 years ago I grabbed a copy. The film is as true to the book as I had hoped. The fact that it wasn't a box office smash, over here at least, is actually a blessing. Many great films are lying in video shops waiting to be discovered, like great music albums. They take a certain audience to appreciate them, this is not the domain of Scwarzenegger & Sandler. The book and movie are on the schools curriculum for English Literature which is ironic as when it was first released the book was banned here in Oz. Both book and movie ought to be consumed by as many people as possible, for in these difficult times with war on the horizon, the sentiments expressed in this tale will make people stop and think about life and its priorities. Sadly , as hinted at earlier, I think the Arnie & Adam mentality will prevail with the masses. A terrific movie adaptation of a modern classic.

Especially when the novel is a classic and integral part of American literature. Such is the case of Gary Sinise's film rendition of John Steinbeck's timeless story Of Mice And Men. From the talented acting to the beautiful imagery kept from the novel, this motion picture should be treated with a deep respect. Not only has the director kept the endearing straightforwardness of the original, he has grown and stretched the characters without detracting from them, a difficult feat by any standards. Unlike the book, the film becomes alive, drawing you deeper and deeper into the dramatic web of Lennie and George, two traveling farm workers trying to make a living during the Great Depression and earn a little on the side to buy their own place. Just a little place, with rabbits and chickens, a place to call their own. Unlike many people today, it's what they really wanted, not a big thing. A place where they could go and hang their hats. The two find a job bucking barley, but trouble just won't let them be. The boss's son has a problem with Lennie, a childlike giant of a man that doesn't understand why the man is trying to fight him. George is driven to protect his simpleminded friend to the end, something he does.The level of acting has not been seen in Hollywood since the days of Audrey Hepbourne and James Stewart. John Malkovich is brilliant as the lovable Lennie, perfectly capturing his true innocence. `George, tell me about them rabbits,' he joyfully exclaims, unaware how odd he seems to an outsider. Who can ever feel anything but passion for a man whose life centers on being able to care for the rabbits? George is also radiantly portrayed by Gary Sinise, keeping the character's gruff manner without making him seem unaffectionate in the least. The supporting cast is also wonderfully depicted, a rarity in today's world. Ray Waltson(Candy), Casey Siemaszko (Curley), Sherilyn Fenn (Curley's wife) and the others make the viewing experience much more pleasurable, bringing depth to the characters, something that was sadly lacking in the novel. The cinematography is beautiful, a stark contrast to the shocking events that occur. The golden light feeling is soothing, adding a jolt when violence rears its ugly head. Beautiful scenery and magnificent directing weaves symbolisms into the story, earning this movie the right to be labeled a film. Truly portraying the real grit of the story, something that the author was incapable of, this version of Of Mice And Men is Oscar worthy, a true gem of a film. When the audience is finished, they have a sense of completion. Loyalty, friendship and the American dream can be understood with simple clarity, and celebrated.

In the movie Of Mice and Men, George and Lennie are the main stars as the bounce around from town to town after getting into a heap of trouble. George (Gary Sinise), who is the care taker of Lennie and the wise man in the two, has to keep moving out of every town they move to because of trouble Lennie gets the two in. Lennie (John Malkovich), who is the childish, disabled, takes the work of five different men into one. What a wonderful duo these two make as the two lonely men scavenge the area for jobs. The setting of the movie takes place in Soledad California. After getting into plenty of trouble in Weed, they must be chased out of there and head on the bus to Soledad. From there, they must walk many miles to Tyler Ranch where they get hired for new jobs. Up to this point, Lennie and George have not had any other people close to them. If often seems like as if they only have each other and a sign of loneliness is present. George often times in this play is annoyed with Lennie because he is clueless on what is going on around him. Lennie may be the only thing making George be so lonely. No one would choose a friendless existence on condition of having all the other things in the world.Lennie himself could take the work of five men into one. Lennie is clueless but a great worker. In the movie, Lennie is allowed to keep his own puppy on the ranch. George tells him to not take him out of the barn. George catches him a few times sneaking him out and he must go back into the barn. Lennie had an ardent love for the puppy. When Lennie is frightened by something he will often grab onto something. He will grab on and won't let go. While playing with the puppy, he pets him and squeezes him too much eventually killing the puppy. This is how he also eventually kills Curley's wife. This resembles a tragic flaw from a tragic hero. Curley (Casey Siemaszko), is the antagonist in this movie. He starts many fights with people especially Lennie. One night, he gets into a fight with him and Lennie gets many punches to the head. Lennie comes back and grabs his hand and making it become gnarled. Curley, the owners son, gets weary and Slim tells him a lie saying he got his hand caught in the machine. For Lennie to keep his job, Curley must listen to that. Every night George must tell Lennie a story. He tells him about how they will finally get some money and buy their own house. Lennie always likes to hear about how he will tame the rabbits at the house. Whenever he hears George talk about this, he exults a burst of happiness and gets excited. When Lennie does something wrong, or the indemnity of the damage is severe, Lennie says he will not be able to tame the rabbits no more. Lennie actually understands when he has done something wrong. Loneliness is the major theme of this movie. At the end, George is fed up with Lennie and him getting into trouble all the time. When he kills Curley's Wife, he knows he must do something that will change everything. He finds Lennie on the side of a river just crying. He has him sit and look at the river. George wanted him to only hear the story last. When he says, I get to tame the rabbits right George, and those were the last words he ever said. George had to kill him.

For as long as anyone can remember this story has been loved and adored by people from all over the globe, all of which have been captured by the pure talent and illustrative writings that the story contains. But, it is only in recent times that the Steinbeck wonderment is brought into the film industries' lime light to be produced as nothing less than a masterpiece anecdote of two traveler's dreams, relationships, and passions. The transformation between book and film has been portrayed close to perfection, with few flaws, and resulting in great viewer satisfaction.'Of Mice and Men' is an originally unique tale concentrating on the hardships of men in the 1930's, with a collage of death, fate, and companionship coed together with a few laughs, and a few cries; this film is a remarkable feat of movie making. The focus of both the book and film is centered around two nomadic travelers, George and Lennie &#150; both of which are uniquely different, with a few commonalties. The most important of these is their shared dream of one-day owning a small plot of land that they can call their own, with a few rabbits, farm-animals, and where no-one may order them about, nor tell them what to do. This dream is modest, yet desperately desired by both men, and they will endure almost anything to get it. George, a clever man played by director Garry Sinise, is the 'leader' of the two men, the one who calls all the shots, and keeping the mentally handicapped Lennie in line; Lennie, acted magnificently by John Malkovich, inarticulately follows George's orders, and instructions to keep out of his own trouble. The loyalty between the two is priceless, and, although frequently strained, they stick together through the harder of hardships &#150; both having each other to rely on. Recently forced into hastily leaving their jobs due to one of Lennie's common but unfortunate misunderstandings; they find themselves on a ranch in California's Salinas Valley, working hard as 'Barley Buckers' for their monthly payment &#150; and ever saving for their dream acreage.The story slowly unfolds as they meld with other solitary travelers at the ranch. Like themselves, they're are others on the road with colourful dreams perpetually present in their own minds. One such fellow traveler is Candy (Ray Walston), the 'ranch elder'. Candy has his eye on George & Lennie's plan, and decides to team up with the duo to buy the land quicker than expected. Everything seems to be happily falling into place, until they meet 'Curly's Wife' (we never hear her actual name). She is a promiscuous, licentious and cunning woman. Curly, the ranch owner's over-protective son is recently married, and intensely paranoid, and out to catch anyone who even so much as looks at his wife. In the end this causes problems of great magnitude for Lennie, as he dim-wittily is drawn in by this girl to inevitably meet his fate. The movie is bursting with exciting twists and turns, with exceptional acting by all characters. Running smoothly from beginning to end, with no 'abrupt ending' &#150; common in many films adapted from books. Although feeling a little disappointed about Lennie's physical size &#150; being described much larger in the novel than in the film, the extremely difficult character was acted out fantastically by John Malkovich, a proclaimed French actor in his own right. He worked the difficult slurs of the character's makeup perfectly, with great involvement and effort he brought 'Lennie' off the pages of the novel to real life.This film shows the true side of people, their dreams and hopes, all wonderfully presented in an enjoyable and challenging fashion. I give it an 8/10. It is a truly lovely rendition of one of America's best pieces of literature.

This 1992 version, however - based directly upon the novel and directed by Gary Sinise - simply isn't worth it considering the competition.  Forced performances, laughable miscasting, and an unneeded reworking of Steinbeck's orginal dialogue leave much to be desired.  One might manage to get a good chuckle out of the ridulously obvious padding beneath Malkovich's clothes (especially the shoulder-pads) in a pathetic attempt to make him appear much larger than he really is, but that would be a high point.  Normally I am quite fond of most of this cast, but Ray Walston's Candy cannot hold a candle to the passionate performance of veteran stage actor Roman Bohnen's take on the character in the 1939 version, especially in his pivotal scene concerning his ailing old dog (no spoilers here - check it out for yourself!)I haven't been so disappointed in a film I'd expected to be fantastic in a long, long time.  Worth the comparison if you happen to be Steinbeck-obsessed like myself, but otherwise choose the Milestone rendition.

Great actor though he is, John Malkovich is hopelessly mis-cast as Lennie. He tries hard, but in the main his performance is more repulsive than child-like and occasionally his lines are close to unintelligable just when they need to be understood. This may be a faithful and accurate attempt by Malkovich at portraying a real person with disabilities, but Lennie really has to be much more lovable for the story to work. The only time Malkovich comes close to this is when he isn't speaking - for example when he's smuggling the puppy into the bunk-house. The film is very faithful to the novel but Steinbecks book wouldn't be a classic if it was as flat as this film.

The entire cast is near perfect. Malkovich and Sinise has pretty good chemistry as the two lead characters. Personally, I liked Sinise better than Malkovich, neither of which are my favorite actors.There are also some strong performances from various members of the supporting cast.

Personally, I would have liked to have seen a few of the supporting characters more.There is some good chemistry with this cast, some better than others. You can really see where the chemistry was best by the scenes with the strongest performances.The soundtrack is completely lacking in this film. In fact, I think I remember only one piece of music near the end of this film. And it sounded like they turned the volume down on that little piece of music that is completely forgettable.The wardrobes, and other period pieces seen in this film, looks very authentic. It didn't appear that they tried to make it look like period clothing, it looked pretty authentic. They even went as far as making the clothing look like they were worn for some time, with little washing.There is no spectacular camera work in this film. There are a couple of foot chases in here with some quick editing. The lighting is used well, and the angles are done nicely. There's just nothing memorable in any of the shots.If you are looking for action, there isn't any worth looking for.

With scenery that perfectly matches the book's descriptions and actors who make the audience believe their characters, this film is accurate in its interpretation of the original text. Rather than try to change the story to fit in with modern day films, the director has chosen to portray the story as it was written, which keeps the original story intact. From this film, the story is given new life without losing any of its original greatness. The actors who star in the film not only fit the physical descriptions of their characters from the story, but also flawlessly interpret and become their characters, making their performances much more believable. When Curley (Casey Siemaszko) is violently harassing Lennie (John Malkovich), Malkovich is able to display the fear and confusion that Lennie feels before unleashing his true strength and crushing the hand of his adversary. This sudden twist from an innocent to a frightening character takes the audience for an emotional ride because Malkovich is able to portray both of these contrasting characteristics. Casey Siemaszko, whose character is averse to almost everyone, seems to become his character as the small but belligerent son of the ranch owner who picks fights and earns himself a gruesome injury to his hand. Gary Sinise does an excellent job at playing George, a character who is not infallible but tries to care for Lennie and is truly torn over making a gargantuan sacrifice. All of the actors' performances truly coincide to create a cast of characters who fit together as seamlessly as they did in the original story. With such believable acting, Steinbeck's original novella is brought to life on the silver screen.The director employs filming techniques that match the mood set by Steinbeck's original descriptions and makes the audience feel as though they are in Steinbeck's original story. The film goes from beautiful scenes of nature to dry, dusty fields and hot, sunny days filled with men at work that portray to the audience the difficult times of the Great Depression. Even shadows are used in certain scenes to create feelings of mystery and suspense. One scene that uses visual artistry is the beginning which shows beams of light cast on George's face while he sits in the dark on a train. The music of this scene is slow and eerie and the scene is shown again at the end of the film. At the beginning, this scene hints that a horrible event has just happened and at the end, adds to the shock of what George has done. Not only does the cinema artistry of this film make it a work of art in itself, but also helps the movie live up to the original mood set by the novella.The film not only stands out because of the acting and film techniques, but also because of the simplicity of the movie. Since the director did not try to alter the original story, the result is a film that twists the emotions of the audience in the same way as the original novella. Trying to alter the story so it could seem more modern would ruin the story because it is not set in modern times. Not trying to make the story more modern and relatable to the audience makes the film just as direct as the original novella and prevents the story from becoming a ridiculous version of its former self.This film remains true to the original book and maintains the value of the original story through exquisite acting, film techniques, and no unnecessary changes made to the plot. The original story is preserved through this film as it brings this timeless classic to a new generation. Vivid characters are brought to life by the actors who flawlessly become their characters as they were in the novella. The story remains intact but still interesting even though the time period that the story takes place in is no longer relevant to the people of today. The film Of Mice and Men is triumphant because it takes Steinbeck's original work and adapts it to the big screen without losing its original feeling and message, allowing the story to be seen as it was meant to be read.

After the sophomoric actions of Lennie ripping a women's dress, the responsibility again falls into George's hands. George's life has revolved around his friend Lennie, and he cannot stop now. Of Mice and Men, a poignant story of two characters who are best friends. Due to Lennie being mentally challenged, George is put into a tough situation and takes care of him. They both do have one ultimate dream; to own a farm and for Lennie to tend the rabbits on it. The movie starts out with George on a train with depressing music in the background, telling you that something bad has happened, along with the time period this is set in. Then it cuts to George and Lennie running away from a town, and a woman running in a ripped red dress. George leads Lennie along a trail to go and find a ranch to work on.At the ranch, the oldest ranch hand, Candy, played by Ray Walston, has an old decrepit dog shot by a fellow rancher named Carlson (Richard Riehle). Lying in bed and hearing the gun shot, Candy regrets that he didn't have the courage to do it himself. This foreshadows when George has to make a huge decision that will affect the way he goes on living. Should he or should he not. After he sees Candy not put his own dog to rest, George knows what to do. Lennie is huge and stronger than any other worker on the farm. Curley (Casey Siemaszko), the owner's son, thinks he is everything and walks around bossing around people. One day an angry Curley saw Lennie and decided to take his anger out on him. After some pushing and shoving, Lennie's monstrous hand completely suppress Curley's fist. Curley's wife (Sherilyn Fenn) asks Lennie what had happened to her husband's hand, but the made up story that everyone is saying is that he got it caught in a machine. This scene in the book was the real climax because after this argument, there was a great deal of tension between the two men.Curley's wife is a very attractive woman who tries to impress all the men that work on the ranch. Due to Curley not showing his love for her, she tries to hit on all the guys who talk to her. Once Curley finds out about people talking, or even going near his wife, he chastises them and threatens revenge. Curley may not show his love for her, but he sure does keep an eye on her to make sure no one touches her. This shows that he is over protective of his wife, making everyone on the farm not like the way he acts towards them.To Lennie, it seems that Curley is a threat. Due to Lennie's problems he gets scared over many things, even the littlest ones. This means that when Curley was yelling at him, he got very frightened and threatening to him. However, George knows that Curley wants to be a reprisal and get another chance to beat up Lennie. Curley is full of himself and thinks he can run the world if got a chance, but he does not realize that Lennie does not know how to control his strength and size and can seriously hurt him. However, George realizes that Lennie may get scared and get beaten down.So what really is going on? Lennie does not remember anything important and keeps getting into trouble, whether it is with Curley's wife, Curley, or anyone else on the ranch. George's job is to make sure Lennie is under control and not causing problems. These two men have a dream. A dream so big to them, it almost seemed impossible to reach. Between fights, arguments, contradictions, all these obstacles made it harder for them to get to this goal, and in the end, you may feel the catharsis of maybe hero, or a betrayer.

One of the greatest parts of this movie was when slim told George A guy don't need no sense to be a nice fella. To me as a young adult I may portray this different then someone whom is a bit younger or older. I see this, as even though you may not be like everyone else you can still be as nice or nicer then many others.At the pinnacle of the movie Curly's wife, played by Sherilyn Fenn, turns from being one of those not so important actresses to a huge impact on the entire story line. She is one of the reasons why George must kill Lennie, when George learns of Lennie killing Curly's wife he knows Curly will do anything to hunt down and kill Lennie. George remembers Candy, played by Ray Waltson, telling him he should have been the one to kill his dog, at this point George knows he is the only one that can because he is the only one Lennie truly trust with his life. Lenny was the type of person who could not remember anything anyone told him, but anything George told him he could remember. When Lennie came across trouble George told him about this spot near the river, George knew right where Lennie would be. As George reached for the revolver in his pocket he wanted Lennie to have his last memories as happy ones so he told him of the rabbits and the ranch they were going to buy, but as Lenny finished his last sentence George pulled the trigger.This is one book that deserves no chastise remarks, the director of this film, Gary Sinise, chose perfect audio to set the moods and also portrayed precise camera angles that made you feel like you were actually experiencing these events.

He wrote the book Of Mice and Men from his own experience as a bindle-stiff in the 1920's. He worked as a farm hand, just like the two lead characters George Milton played by Gary Sinise and Lennie Small played by John Malkovich, in the movie. The movie Of Mice and Men is categorized a drama film, and takes place in California during the Great Depression. George and Lennie are two hired work hands who though very poor and not very fortunate are lucky because they had each other. During this time period and setting loneliness and alienation was common for all men like George and Lennie. Most men traveled alone to find work. George feels responsible for Lennie because George knew Lennie's aunt who took care of him until she died. Lennie had no one to take care of him so George took him under his wing. Throughout the film you learn about Steinbeck's motives and underlying truths weaved into the dialog of George and Lennie.Of Mice and Men begins with a woman screaming, crying and running in a prairie- like field. With her are men on horses with guns and dogs that seem to be chasing or tracking down something. George and Lennie are running from these men because Lennie gave a woman the impression he was raping her by grabbing a hold of her dress. Lennie is mentally disabled and does not know how to control himself. He loves touching soft things and when he saw the woman's dress he couldn't help but grab it. They escape to this pond where George explains to Lennie if he ever gets in trouble to come back to the pond and hide in the bushes. At the new ranch that George and Lennie go to work at, Lennie finds something else soft to touch and feel. The head ranch hand has a dog that has recently given birth to puppies and Lennie falls in love with petting and feeling the runt of the bunch. There is a story that Lennie loves to hear from George and frequently asks him to retell it. George tells him about their dream. This dream is told throughout the movie. Steinbeck is trying to portray this dream of man constantly falling short of their hopes and dreams. He portrays not what we read about or what makes us happy but the truth. The truth in this time period was that man was constantly fighting just to survive, it was a daily struggle. There was this constant desire for companionship and ownership of land or anything to call their own. In the film the boss that George and Lennie work for has a son named Curly who has a wife that Steinbeck chooses never to name. She had no more worth than just property to Curly. He constantly acts and talks to her like he owns her and tries to keep her in the house at all times.In Steinbeck's film we can understand the entire movie, plot and Steinbeck's motives by just one dialog by George and Lennie when George is retelling Lennie their dream. George says to Lennie, Guys like us that work on ranches are the loneliest guys in the world. They ain't got no family and the got no place. They got nothing to look ahead to. Lennie interrupts him in mid sentence saying, But not us George! Tell about us! George continues with a grin, Well we ain't like that. We got a future. We got someone to talk to that gives a damn about us. If them other guys gets in jail they can rot for all anybody cares. Lennie interrupts again, But not us George, because I, see, I got you to look after me, but you got me to look after you. This simple dialog can explain everything about the outlook of man at this period in time. Man had nothing to look forward to but to survive and nothing to call their own. Steinbeck illustrates this sad but true picture through his dialog throughout the whole story of Of Mice and Men. In the end I believe Steinbeck was trying to portray the life of the men that no one notices or looked over. The truths behind what others would leave out and I would recommend this film strongly to anyone not just looking for a good movie but for those in search of something pure, true, real and historic.

Gary Sinise plays George Milton, a struggling farm worker with dreams of one day having his own farmland to work, while protecting his dim-witted and strong-backed friend Lennie Smalls played by John Malkovich. Lennie is a sweet but slow man, who due to his learning difficulties and the stigma attached to that at the time, often ends up getting in trouble and the pair lose their jobs, and are forced to hit the road once again in search for new work. The Film begins with the George and Lennie on a train escaping their previous job, where they were chased away by men and dogs, running because Lennie, in his innocent way, created a problem that was misunderstood. Its obvious that George cares deeply for Lennie, not only through the way he takes care of Lennie, but also how he tells to Lennie of how when they raise enough money to buy a plot of land they can tend, and Lennie will raise the rabbits, because of his fondness for soft and cute things. As they make their way to their new place of work having been lied to by a bus driver not wanting to take them all the way to the new ranch kicks them off the bus and they have to make their way on foot. Stopping in a creek bed to rest, George tells Lennie about the farm they will have together again, and tells Lennie should anything bad happen to meet him there again. After they meet the farmer they meet his son Curly, who is an angry young man, and fearsome fist fighter to boot. Curly's wife is bored and left alone by Curly on the farm and always trying to talk to all the farm hands to spark Curly's anger. The story continues and them men work in the field, none quite as efficiently as Lennie, who is strong enough to double the speed of all the other hands. This leads to some griping to those who cannot keep up with his speed. Lennie is finally rewarded with a puppy of his own to care, although it is not old enough to leave its mother, he sometimes sneaks it away to pet, until George catches him at it. The climax starts to rise as George and Lennie bring the old man Candy, with one hand, who will help pay for the farm, because once Candy becomes to old to be any help, the ranchers will fire him, and he will not be able to cope on his own even though he has $350 saved up. Gary Sinise as director was clever in the way he created the feeling of the film, by not explaining too much about George and Lennie's past before they were in the boxcar of the opening sequence, expressing the details of what happened that led to the chase, in quick shots that are supposed to be memories. Sinise also uses Candy's old dog which the men call useless as a simile to Candy's own age and ability to work with only one hand. Eventually the men coerce Candy into letting them put down his dog, to which Candy later commiserates to George that they will not to do him, only firing him, and Candy would then have no way of helping himself. The Music was edited to be playing only in certain parts of the film that were emotionally charged, whether happy like when George was telling Lennie the story about the rabbits, or when danger loomed at the beginning when the boys were being chased out of their old job. Generally the music is very subdued and fades in and out from scene to scene. Most of the time when the men are working or just talking there is no music at all. Generally, Of Mice and Men is a fantastic drama, telling the story of life in the depression, and societal reactions to those with disabilities. Lennie is the sweetest of characters and only causes trouble because of the way he is. Be sure if you watch this movie, to look for repeated motifs put in place by Sinise, and pay attention to how well the music sets off the emotions of the scenes.

Sinise and Steinbeck were close friends and when Steinbeck died Sinise decided to create the motion adaptation into something that he knew from his heart that Steinbeck would have enjoyed to watch over and over again. John Malkovich plays the character Lennie Small, with music by Mark Isham, and Kenneth MacMillan as the Director of Photography. This movie is set in the depression era and is no doubt a drama. The riveting story is a tale of two men whom travel together across the land to make money to fulfill their dreams. George is a small quick witted man, while Lennie is a slow giant. They often have to find work elsewhere because Lennie accidentally falls into trouble. Lennie and George came together because George knew Lennies aunt Clair whom use to give Lennie rabbit and mice to pet because he loved to pet soft things. Lennie would often kill the animals by petting them too hard, so aunt Clair stopped giving them. Clair died and asked George to take care of Lennie, so George made the promise. Since then they had been traveling together with the thought of one day owning a land of their own. George would often tell this detailed story of owning the fat of the land to Lennie, and promised him that one day he would get to tend the rabbits.When watching this movie compared to the book one thing to think about is how convincing and well played everything is. Most can say that it depends on the actors skills to persuade the audience, but without the perfect camera location, the movie could look like another youtube sensation. Kenneth MacMillan does an excellent job at creating mood solely with the camera, for example when Carlson was persuading Candy to let him shoot his old dog. Carlson walked over to his bunk to retrieve his gun, but Slim was having a conversation with Whitt about somebody in the newspaper. However Slim and Whitt were blurred out, showing Carlson in the back ground showing that although other things are happening within the room. Candy is only focused on one thing. Another thing to consider is the music placement within the film. Mark Isham did the music track to this film and definitely made the movie a seat gripping experience when something were to occur. Music can change the mood and emotion of just about anything. Just in the beginning when it showed the woman in the red dress running for her life the music was very appealing to the ear letting us know that nothing completely fatal had happened, but something unfortunate and accidental may have occurred. The music throughout the movie is very western and well placed.Overall this film was a hoot and a holler. John Malkovich played a stunning roll as Lennie, and Gary Sinise could not have done a better job at re-creating such a great book into a movie. Watch this with an open mind and you will be placed into their shoes, as well as their hearts.

Gary Sinise, who also played George, directed the 1992 novel-based film. John Malkovich played the part of Lennie. Other supporting actors include Casey Siemaszko as Curley, and Sherilyn Fenn as Curley's wife. The movie is set during the Depression Era, at a time when the government paid ranchers to take on extra workers. This dramatic film is the story of their efforts to fulfill their dream of owning a farm of their own.George and Lennie are men traveling by railway to their new job as ranch hands. Because Lennie does not know his own strength, he accidentally kills his pet mouse. George promises to get Lennie a dog if Lennie would stop taking mice to be his pets. True to his word, George finds Lennie a pup of his own, and Lennie enjoyed playing and petting his pup anytime he could. Shortly after arriving, Lennie and George get acquainted with Curley, the boss' son. Lennie soon becomes Curley's target of aggression, because Lennie, being mentally handicapped, was an easy target for him. Lennie also became the target of Curley's wife's attention too, because she saw him as a willing ear to vent her frustrations. She became a problem to Lennie because Curley, who already wanted to hurt Lennie, found out about their conversations. Curley was infuriated, and started a fight with Lennie. It was only when George allowed him did Lennie fight back. After the fight George helps Lennie clean his wounds and help him recover emotionally. I enjoyed the scene of Lennie's first day working, because Lennie's job was to help load sacks of grain into a cart. To lift one sack of grain, two men were required, or Lennie. Lennie was so big and strong that he could lift a whole sack of grain by himself, thereby doubling the work that could be done. Another of my favorite scenes was the one with Lennie lying in the barn, playing with his pup. Finally, I think one of the most sad moments in the movie is when Lennie is in the barn, mourning the death of his pup. His pup died because he doesn't know his own strength, One aspect of the film that I enjoyed is the acting. Gary Sinise and John Malkovich play their parts perfectly, and the rest of the cast make the story come to life. I think that the delivery of the lines played a big part in making the movie realistic. George's lines are strong, and fast, and show how much he cares for Lennie. Lennie's lines are delivered more slowly, and are usually fragmented into single thoughts or ideas. Lennie's facial expressions also set the mood for different scenes during the movie. As an example, when Curley started punching Lennie, Lennie was not angry at first, but was only confused. Only when George told Lennie to fight back, did Lennie save himself.Another aspect I liked was the directing. Gary Sinise delivered the movie as close to the book as possible, and brought it to life visually. Sinise had a good understanding of the novel, its settings, and the events surrounding the story line. Sinise wanted his audience to believe that the story was real, by using scenes that appeal to the viewer's senses. For an example, the ranch owner did not have a luxurious house, but more of a cozy country home. The director These make the scenes more pleasant to look at and add minute details for the effect he desired.A wonderful movie, Of Mice and Men, is timeless. This movie is better watched all at once, rather than coming in late during the movie, or stopping halfway through.

It stars John Malkovich, Lennie, and Gary Sinise, George. Alexis Arquette and Sherilyn Fenn are the female actors in this movie. It's a very good and interesting movie and serves its purpose pretty well.It is very symbolic that the film begins and ends at the pond. It's trying to say that life comes in full circle. The characters are so powerless to accomplish their dream. They are limited to their circumstances and the social environment surrounding them. Their dreams never come true. Every time, they try something they end up back at the same point. It allows the audience to reflect on how life is full of difficulties, and unfortunately, many of them are caused by injustice. But we need to work hard and try to take the right steps. John Malkovich does a great job being Lennie. He portrays Lennie's character so well. Lennie is so naive despite all his extraordinary physical strength. He is as pure and kind hearted as a child. There is only one thing that he really understands; and that is love. You can clearly feel the impact of love on him. He appreciates George's love and care for him, so he is willing to do anything for him. Lennie is as a clear hollow reed &#x96;empty of all the veils we, human, create for ourselves- which love can flow through him to anything. John is fully able to help the audience really feel this. He's able to help us relate to Lennie's character. Gary Sinise is also able to portray George's character very well, and make the audience feel like he/she is involved in the story. He is very good at having appropriate facial expressions and body language in each scene. He makes you believe you're in there. In the story, George shoots his beloved companion, Lennie, to spare him a cruel death. He knows that Lennie will be killed by the angry mob, for (accidentally) murdering Curley's wife. On the other hand, Candy is not able to shoot his old dog. Perhaps, if Candy was in the same situation, he would shoot his dog to spare him a cruel death. These parts of the stories are just different expressions of genuine love for another creature. Some could be a good role-model and some a bad one, depending on the conceptual beliefs of an audience.All characters of the movie are lonely in a way or another. George and Lennie, have no home, neither family. Still, loneliness could be seen different for each. George doesn't even have someone to understand him, consult with, and share his thoughts with. On the other hand, George knows Lennie pretty well and tried to understand his circumstances. Curley is isolated because he's trying to be that leader / Son of the Boss which he is so disable to accomplish. He's on the wrong path. He never learned that he can do that by building strong relationships and being a good example. His wife has no one to interact with. There are no females on the ranch, and all the men try to ignore her because they're afraid of Curley.At the end of the story, Curley is trying to find Lennie and kill him. His real motivation for wanting to kill Lennie is not so much to take revenge for his wife's murder. Curley finds this, a good opportunity to take revenge for what Lennie did to his hand, to stop him from beating him up. He also thinks that this is a good chance for him to show off his power and find his place as the number one guy.

The time this story took place was around the 1920's. In this film there are two main stars Gary Sinise who plays George and John Malkovich who plays Lennie's character. Lennie is a little bit slow and needs George to guide him and help him along the way. George is very mature and takes care of not only himself but Lennie too. At times he gets frustrated and upset, but at the end of the day he loves Lennie. Even though at times in this film there would be a joke or a laugh this was not a comedy it was a drama and very serious throughout. This movie begins with two men running away from a large group of men and dogs. It does not show why they are running away but you notice they are very scared and are sprinting for what could be there lives. In the movie they hide in very thick grass to escape these men and finally travel along the road. While they travel George knows exactly where they are going to go. They have to find a new place to work so they can obtain money. George often tells Lennie about a house and land with bunnies, this is what their goal is after they raise enough money. They dream of having their own place to live and their own land to tend. When they arrive at the ranch they are going to work at, they see where they will be staying. Lennie doesn't like this place at all, but he realizes that if they work hard enough and stay out of trouble he will be able to take care of the rabbits on their own ranch. During their stay at the ranch the head ranchers son Curly picks on Lennie because of his disability. He tries to get into fights with him. One night Curly started to punch Lennie repeatedly in the face until finally George gave Lennie the okay to fight back. Once he fought back he completely crushed Curly's hand with only one arm. Even though Lennie is slow he is extremely strong and can crush anything or anyone with only one hand. Curly found this out the hard way. Although Lennie crushed Curly's hand he did not want to, he doesn't like violence and wouldn't choose to fight if he didn't have to. One night George goes out to the town with some of the guys and leaves Lennie at the ranch by himself. While Lennie wanders around, he comes to a single room with a light on. He goes in and is immediately met by a man yelling at him. This man was the only black man on the ranch and was secluded from the rest of the workers because of his skin color. However Lennie didn't understand any of this and just wanted someone to talk to. At the first sight of Lennie the man was angry and thought it made no sense coming in there since nobody had before. After the beginning outburst they sat down and talked or a while until George came back and took Lennie back to their room. While the men work on the ranch most of the other look at Lennie in a strange way because he is different than most people. However one of the head ranchers Slim is very pleased to have him a part of his group considering his strength. While other men go in two's to carry bags of different things Lennie can do it all by himself and make it a much faster system. This makes the rancher very pleased and shows Lennie in a good light. Music in a film is a huge role and can make or break a movie in some cases. The reason it is such a huge deal is because a lot of times music can determine the mood of a person or of an entire scene for that matter. When there is something bad happening or sad the music usually follows that emotion. In times of happiness there is an upbeat and uplifting song to go along with that certain scene. In this movie there were many occasions where music was an important part of the scene such as the opening scene. In the first scene you see two men running for what would seem like their lives. In the back round the music is fast and somewhat angry and this goes along with the scene perfectly. Another example where music is a large part in the movie is the scene where George becomes very angry and upset with Lennie. They are by the river during this scene and there was a sad melody playing in the background that suits this scene just right. Another aspect of film is the acting. It is very important, this is how the actors present themselves and make sure they play the role correctly. In the film Of Mice and Men, John Malkovich plays Lennie. John Malkovich plays a person with a disability. However in real life he does not have that disability, therefore in this movie he did a wonderful job showing the audience the real character and how the director wanted him to be portrayed. Gary Sinise who is also the director of the film plays George. George is very stern and is known for being mature and in charge. Gary Sinise does a very great job of showing the audience how George should be looked at. Overall I think this was a tremendous film, the director and actors did a wonderful job showing the viewers how the story was suppose to be portrayed. If you are looking for a funny happy movie this is definitely not the movie for you. Even though I believe this is a great movie it is also very sad and you may find yourself crying at certain points during the movie.

The very beginning with Girl in the Red Dress, as well as the scene where Curley's Wife is first introduced, and the conversation George has with Slim about their previous home, builds up this ominous shadow that stands just above George, Lenny, and Candy's dream. All of the characters have their own problem and their own story. Curley's Wife has no one to talk to, and uses her body to try coax the ranch hands into a simple conversation. Candy is coerced into letting one of the other workers put down his dog because the dog is worthless; he knows that because he is near worthless to the other workers he will have to be put down as well. Both of these characters, although not main characters, nor the best examples, really show Steinbeck's view of the human condition.One thing that surprised me in this movie was the soundtrack. I am a music major and always take note of great soundtracks, but this one baffled me. Usually directors use their soundtracks to create a more emotional pull into scenes or to grab the viewer's attention. This movie's lack of a soundtrack, in my opinion, made it better. The acting and writing, was enough to keep my attention held from start to finish.This movie is an intense experience; it will pull you in from the very beginning, and not let go until hours after you have finished watching it.

The year was back in the mid to late 30's back when the Great Depression was still felt and jobs were limited.The biggest thrill I get from movies like this is its like going back in time to when things such as autism and other mental conditions were still misunderstood. In the movie you get a real since on how things were back then. From the Greyhound bus strip to working in the wheat fields with the wheat thresher. A time where Television hasn't even reached parts of the country such as this.As far as the two characters Lenny played by John Malkovich and George played by Gary Sinise both bring a certain freshness to the story. This movie has been made a number of times and its a relief to see how this story plays out through new actors. John brings an excellent performance in the kind, strong man known as Lenny. A man that understands very little in the world around him, and still have the kindness and gentle heart that is rare in such a man.George Melton played by Gary Sinis balanced out the duel in a most interesting way. Though Lenny was quiet and didn't speak much, he always had George there to guide him in the right direction. George on the other hand wasn't as big or as strong as Lenny but a made up for it in by helping Lenny in areas that wasn't as easy. The bond the two had remind me of two brothers, two men that understood each other. Both having a lack of skills but together working as a team. The movie over all was pretty well made, the picture was fantastic. Music was well written, and the scenes were well blended. I've watched the movie at least three times since it came out and every time I watch it there are some scenes that i still cant watch. It's a great story for people of all ages, and its a movie people can take a lesson from and apply that lesson into todays world.

The film deals with some very deep subjects. Social attitudes are displayed but not analysed. The only black character in the film is discriminated against more than the mentally-deficient white man. At the time of the writing of Stenibeck's novel (1938) this was a far more relevant message than it is today. Malkovich is excellent in the role of the main character his portrayal elicits both sympathy and understanding from the audience in the face of homicidal brutality. In isolation, this is a worthy piece of work and should have had a lot more recognition than it received. As an adaptation of a novel written when the world was a very different place, it is a true and fine reflection of attitudes of the time.Here ends to review of the film. Now begins a wider topicI am sure the 1938 novel was ground-breaking in its treatment of a handicapped person as a real human being. At that time, for whatever reason, Steinbeck decided that his main character should in fact turn out to be a murderer. Civilisation has moved on since then, however, and just as the prejudice shown towards to black character is unthinkable today, then so should be the tendency in the cinema to portray mentally handicapped people as dangerous psycopaths.In the context of many other movies that deal with mental disorder, this is yet another story of a 'very gentle' maniac who wins our sympathy but ultimately never our trust. Look at 'Slingblade','Cuckoos Nest' and a lot of other 'understandable lunatic' films and you will see that although the audience is invited to identify and condemn the injustice that society delivers to the mentally ill, the carpet is pulled from under them because the handicapped person they are just getting to know and to understand and sympathise with turns out to be a darkly negative character, thus reinforcing the prejudices the audience had when they entered the movie theatre. This is an insidious and even dangerous trend. Why bother to lead people up a blind alley? When is Hollywood going to grow up and realise that most people suffering from mental disorders are not homicidal and are on the contrary highly valuable human beings. When will there be a truly credible and positive mentally-retarded lead character on the screen who does not end with his hands in a bath of blood? I am not talking about 'comic-book retards' like Forest Gump or the proto-lunatics (no pun intended) living on K-Pax. Mentally deficient people are not all murderers. 'Of Mice and Men' is a film showing attitudes from 80 years or so ago. As such it an engaging and positive work. Film makers who deal with modern scripts set in the present should not resort to the prejudices of 80 years ago.

Course this is the only Of Mice and Men movie I've seen so far.The story takes place during the Great Depression. Two farm hands escape from their previous job due to an accident.One of them is a short guy named George who is the brains of the duo.The other is Lennie, tall and stupid, and has trouble remembering things.They're both traveling by train to find a new farm hand job.George looks after Lennie because Lennie wouldn't be able to take care of himself due to his condition. Lennie always ask George what they're going to do when they earn enough money. George tells him that one day they'll own a farm for themselves. But Lennie had a hard time remembering their goal.Lennie also has a bad habit of keeping mice that he accidentally kill. He just likes to pet them, but he doesn't it so rough it kills them. And Lennie has an obsession with Rabbits because he likes to pet them and pet anything that's soft.When they got a job at a farm George tries to tell Lennie that if he gets into trouble he must run and hide and wait for him(George) to tell him the coast is clear.The story is different from other Country/Farm related stories. It's Dramatic and has it's moments. The movie is very close to the original novel. Course there's tiny details that are different from the book. It's not too bad to read.Of Mice and Men is also believed to be the original to the common Smart and Stupid duos.Such as George and Jr. from the Tex Avery cartoons, Rocky and Mungsy from Looney Tunes, Ren and Stimpy, and any one who's large and dumb who resembles Lennie in a way.So if you get the chance see about checking out this movie or read the book.

After a long chat with an old friend about the book, I thought I'd check it out, expecting to be sorely disappointed.In fact, I felt quite the opposite. Gary Sinise is one of the most underrated actors in American cinema, and is pretty well suited to this role. It came as no surprise then that his performance was beautiful, and truly the heart of the film. It therefore seems fitting that he also directed it. By no means do I wish to suggest any vanity on his part, only that he knew exactly what he wanted to do with this movie, and he did it wonderfully. It is perfectly paced, and what little is omitted from the book is not damaging. It is also beautifully shot.The casting is very good on the whole, despite Ray Walston and Casey Siemaszko playing a little too close to stereotype. Sinise himself is typically superb. There is, however, on exception; the usually brilliant John Malcovich.I love Malcovich's work, but was particularly wary of him playing Lenny in this movie. It was just plain wrong. He seems uncomfortable (and I don't mean he's acting it) with what he had to do to such an extent that Lenny just came off as a two-dimensional caricature - which is an outrage given the subtle brilliance of Steinbeck's writing of him.It's not Malcovich's fault. If blame must be laid it should really be on Sinise for not seeing it and/or not doing anything about it. Having said that, if I were making a movie and had a chance to have John Malcovich in it - I'd have him in it! He's just wrong for this part in my opinion and, sadly, lets an otherwise beautiful film down.

This scene coincides with one of a woman running across a field wearing a torn dress.  Armed men on horseback are pursuing Lennie and George.  The era of the depression is evident as the two make their way to the bus station.  It is also revealed that Lennie is mentally deficient.Along the way, George recites their dream for Lennie.  Lennie wants so badly to live in the small house, haul in wood for the stove and especially tend to the rabbits that live in the hutches George will build.Lennie and George arrive at the Tyler ranch and are greeted by Candy (Ray Walston), an elderly farm hand accompanied by a very old and scruffy dog.  The fondness the man has for the dog is relevant to the main plot. Other characters come into play as George and Lennie are shown to their bunks.  The ranch owner's son Curley (Casey Siemaszko) makes it known that he will be the one to cause Lennie needless grief. Curley brings his repulsive demeanor to the bunk house one evening and taunts Lennie into an altercation. Unable to tolerate the one sided beating George commands Lennie to fight back.  Lennie does and it results in Curley's hand being crushed.  Shortly after, Candy is bullied into allowing another ranch hand to shoot his dog. The litter of new pups in the barn only brings another tragedy.  As Lennie does not know his own strength, he crushes one of the puppies to its death.  Curley's wife (Sherilyn Fenn) subsequently arrives in the barn, not realizing the game she is about to play with Lennie will result in the same outcome as the pup.  Once again, the armed men on horseback are in pursuit of George and Lennie. There was little deviation by Director Gary Sinese from the original Steinbeck novel.  Loneliness, violence, human interaction and dreams all are conveyed through the characters.

Lately, many producers and directors are satisfied with stupid stories as material for their blockbuster movies. In fact, you know that we're having problems when the feature films that are scoring the most in the box offices and getting the most amount of votes on the IMDB are the same films that have the least amount of content. Current standings show that the Blair Witch Project and the Sixth Sense are the box office favorites - even among the hyped plethora of teeny bopper movies, such as Big Daddy and the new Austin Powers, and spiffed up special effects movies like the Matrix and the Haunting. At first glance, it appears that moviegoers are being trapped when they head for the theatres and are left having to settle for movies without any substance. Recently, when arriving at the box office window the typically easy question, what movie shall we see? has become as difficult to answer as Hamlet's immortally infamous, to be or not to be?If those who go the movies only want to waste time and to leave the theatre without having their mind being engaged in any fashion at all, then Hollywood is finally figuring out what type of movies make money. But if there still are many good American citizens with any sense of discernment whatsoever, they'll head straight to the local video store to rent or purchase a copy of Of Mice and Men.Of Mice and Men's beauty comes first from the story itself. John Steinbeck's classic novel is one of the most prolific names in the heart of decent and intelligent literature in America. It's becoming more and more difficult to try and derive a screenplay from a wonderful novel and still make it successful on screen... but it wasn't for Gary Sinise. He took this masterpiece and made it a living, breathing, inspirational work on the big screen.The acting is wonderful. John Malkovich has and still hasn't done better work than the believable portrait he provided for Lennie Small. Gary Sinise hasn't tried directing a major film since Of Mice and Men, probably because of the lack of attention this movie receives, but this was just as good and possibly better than anything a Kubrick, Scorsese, or a Spielberg have dneo in the 20th Century.My rating for this movie is a perfect 10. It's power is in the story, it's beauty is in the acting, and it's chock full of things for the audience to ponder and think about. This film can't be ignored.

Due to his unusual size and simple mind however, Lennie has a penchant for getting into trouble. Things are looking up when they land a job harvesting wheat and befriend kindly old man Candy, as the three plan to throw in together and buy a little place of their own. Tragedy awaits however ...John Steinbeck's classic novel is an astonishingly powerful and moving story about loyalty, friendship and fickle fate, and is so well known that George and Lennie have become iconic character archetypes. This adaptation, brilliantly scripted by Horton Foote, and exceptionally well directed, was an obvious labour of love for star, co-producer and director Sinise, and his film is rich and passionate, filled with memorable scenes and performances. The lynchpin character is of course Lennie, and your reaction to the story is largely dependant upon your reaction to him. If you see him as a dangerously retarded brute then you might want to try getting yourself a soul; if you see him as a human being with an innate right to respect and dignity then this becomes a searing drama in which his death is one of the most shockingly profound moments in any story. The film has a trio of great performances; Sinise is us, an anchor of solid and rational sobriety, Malkovich is superb as Lennie, playing him as a child with a high-pitched voice but never overdoing it or shying away from his frustrating nature, and Walston has a great turn as the ageing Candy, who only wants to find some simple rest from a hard life. Don't miss Morton either, in a brief but telling role as the crippled stablehand Crooks, who briefly discovers through Lennie every man's fundamental need for companionship. Featuring a fantastic subtle score by Mark Isham, and shot in beautiful sun-splattered golden harvest locations in the Santa Ynez Valley in California, this is a tremendous film of a great book and a remarkable achievement for Sinise. Trivia - both Sinise and Malkovich learned their trade in a Chicago-based theatre-troupe called Steppenwolf, and the title comes from Robert Burns' poem, To A Mouse.

The constant movement has taken its toll on their plans as they move to yet another ranch to work as labour. They settle in well and quickly find themselves with a great opportunity if only they can stay out of trouble.Somewhat of a labour of love for Sinise this film perhaps doesn't totally benefit from how close he is to it because he doesn't seem able to control he problems and get to the very heart of the matter. The story is in essence a strong one and it is a classic Steinbeck but with the short running time it does simplify things a little bit and some of the parallels and symbolism in the tale comes out as being a bit too obvious with the time pressure to get them out. However at its core this is still an enjoyable story that is pretty well told and is engaging throughout. One of the problems with the delivery is the cast and their performances because some of them aren't really up to it.Sinise plays it all a bit too worthy and he wears his patience like a badge at times; he isn't that convincing and, although he does well enough to carry the film, he isn't good enough to make George a real person. Malkovich has the bigger role but he misjudges his gentle giant &#150; making him too mentally retarded and coming across like a subpar Rainman. It is a shame because the story still works but I just found his vision of Lenny to be too simplistic and lacking in heart &#150; I felt pity for him but I don't think that that was the actual aim. The support cast is so-so. Siemaszko is a bit of a non-entity as Casey while Fenn is just too simplistic with all her failed attempts at sultriness. Support from Arquette, Terry, Willingham, Norton and others is all OK but they don't do much other than fill in around the edges.Overall it is a fine story that is told well enough here to do the job but could have been better. The cast don't really help matters with their performances and you can't help feeling that perhaps Sinise should have slightly loosened his grip on the film to allow others to provide him with some input and balance.

It is quite a sad moment at the end, and the villain is pretty nasty, but it is still quite good. Good!

I will always remember this as the first movie I walked out on before it was over. That idiot freak kills the one girl (Sherilyn Fenn) that doesn't deserve it, and that was it for me. Turned me down so much that I couldn't bring myself to be interested in the rest of the story. The two are not the actors (or characters) one can sympathize with. So drunken men cause a lot of mischief, accidents happen, retards are stupid, and brother has problems dealing with his difficult relative. Hope does not make it better. Oh, and yeah, reality pretty much stinks. Tell us something we don't already know.It was years later when I finally saw the rest of the movie on TV, out of boredom mostly, only to discover I was right about my predictions on how the rest of the story would be. Nothing surprising, nothing exciting, just wasted minutes I should have spent sleeping.
