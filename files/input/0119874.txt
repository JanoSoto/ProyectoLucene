Yet the movie serves its purpose; to bring some mindless entertainment with some nicely done action.Nicole Kidman in a main part of an action movie? Yes, Nicole Kidman in the main part of an action movie and who would have ever known, she is actually believable in her part but her acting is just a bit too standard and boring but yet like I said before, her characters remains believable. Thumbs up for that! But the best roles are played by George Clooney and Armin Mueller-Stahl, who is always great in a movie.The movie's opening is really a memorable one and is one of the very best action movie openings I have ever seen along with The Rock, which was made one year earlier. After that the movie looses some of it's power and pace and we begin losing interest until the next action sequence occurs. Yes, it truly are the action sequences that are the highlights of the movie and make this movie a watchable one.The visual style of the movie is also what makes this movie above average. The cinematography by Dietrich Lohmann gives the movie a cool action movie feeling. Dietrich Lohmann unfortunately died not much later during or shortly after completing the movie Deep Impact.The music by Hans Zimmer is most excellent.

Did anybody think the first movie out of the gate from a studio owned by David Geffen, Jeffrey Katzenberg, and Steven Spielberg be an artsy-fartsy film?  For what it is, this is pretty good. Director Mimi Leder does a good job keeping everything going (she was less successful with her follow-up, DEEP IMPACT), and I was involved the whole way through.  I like George Clooney and Nicole Kidman, but I will admit they don't get a whole lot to do here.  Like the similar MISSION IMPOSSIBLE, there's not a whole lot of character development for the heroes, so the film depends on whether or not you like the stars, and fortunately, I do.The one distinguishing factor of the movie is the villain, played by Marcel Iures.  While the one who steals the missiles is your standard action villain, there's a gravity and sadness Iures brings that's unexpected in a film like this.  This is no sneering DIE HARD rip-off, but a guy who takes an action because he feels it's the only choice he has, and the film at least brings forth the notion that if that's how he feels, we the Western powers are somewhat culpable.

Julia's intelligence background and Thomas' more direct approach don't gel too well, but they must recover the weapons before they are used in a terrorist strike against the US.This starts well &#150; with the detonation of a nuke in rural Russia, and indeed it goes on quite well from there. The story is the basic 'terrorist with stolen nuke' story but it has sufficient ability to rise above the norm to be quite enjoyable. The odd-couple of Devoe and Kelly isn't made too much of and it avoids that pitfall. The action scenes are handled well and, though lacking in flair, they do contain plenty of tension and excitement.The cast really help &#150; in particular Clooney. Clooney takes what could have been just a one dimensional tough military role and adds layers to it. His violence is just beneath the surface and it shows in his face and eyes. At times he does what is expected of him &#150; but for the most he lifts the role and the film. Kidman also does well &#150; at times she is a screaming side-kick, but she also has a bit of depth there too. The support cast never really get beyond ethnic stereotype &#150; only Armin Mueller-Stahl has a good role. There are some interesting roles given to now famous people &#150; Boatman (Carter in Spin City) and, to complete the ER coonnection between star and director, Goran Visnijc in a tiny role.Overall this is a standard story. But a top-class Clooney and plenty of good, tense action scenes make this much better than the average stolen bomb flick.

This taut, well-written and finely acted espionage film is different that those currently in front of us made in 1997 this film in retrospect had a better grip on just how frightening terrorism is and how two-sided the implications of danger usually are.Filmed with never let your guard down suspense, the story is rather simple nuclear weapons are circulating with one headed to the US and the military joins with science in tracking the carrier of the bomb. George Clooney is in fine form as Lt. Col. Thomas Devoe, professional yet charismatic and his scientific colleague is Dr. Julia Kelly, with Nicole Kidman delivering a polished performance. And for once we get to see a terrorist as a person Dusan Gavrich (Marcel Iures), despite his mission to destroy us, is a vulnerable, bruised human being. The supporting roles are well handled by such strong character actors as Armin Mueller-Stahl.Cinematographer Dietrich Lohmann keeps the action lively with multi-angled shots and surveillance scenes and the tension is well maintained with the music score by Hans Zimmer. But in the final analysis the credit for the success of this film lies in the capable hands of Mimi Leder. A terrific little suspense film.

It did what it set out to do, to entertain, though post 911, the premise is especially scary (how poignant to see the WTC in the New York skyline).I was drawn into the plot, and didn't care about any inconsistencies or holes. Everything came across as plausible.As for the comment made ccthemovieman-1 about the unlikelihood of someone of Nicole Kidman's looks being in a position like that, well, all I can say is that he should take a look at some of the female analysts and spies (ie. Valerie Plame) that work not only in the US government, but also others like Israel.Make no mistake, many of them are as beautiful as they are intelligent. And I give kudos to the filmmakers for resisting the one formulaic turn, and that is making it into a romance flick where the male/female protagonists first dislike each other and then fall into each others arms by the end of the movie.So, for all those who say this movie is predictable, here's one predictable and clich√©d turn it didn't take. It concentrated on the action and suspense, and only hinted in the very end at the possibility of a romance.It was interesting to see, that even though Dr. Kelly was Devoe's boss, the actual dynamics were in reverse, with her following Devoe's lead for most of the time, and listening to lectures from him about her inexperience.I guess the movie's producers thought it was too much for someone like Clooney to constantly take orders from a woman. A formulaic turn, I suppose.Clooney and Kidman acquitted themselves well in their roles, as did Marcel Iures who portrayed the terrorist. He came across as human, and a truly tragic, sympathetic, though misguided, figure, imo.The train hijack sequence was awesome. "},{"Title":"Stylish, hi-tech, completely unbelievable...

I bought that record of his, Whip It!) and Nicole Kidman in severe-skirted secretary mode (as White House Liaison, Julia Kelly), saving White America from nuke-thieving Russkies who intend to blow up Manhattan. In movies of this ilk, the American Military is omniscient, portrayed as so technologically advanced they can pinpoint license plate numbers half a world away; relishing showing off their spy-satellite capabilities and infiltration devices - yet never putting that technology to use in deterring the theft of nuclear weapons in the first place. They seemingly only use these gadgets to sell your confidential details to lowlife corporate bidders, to conveniently lose your records when you report an identity fraud and to send you garbage-loads of junk mail whenever you purchase a new electronic appliance with your credit card &#150; instead of doing something important like CAPTURING OSAMA BIN LADEN. As Devoe says, Toil Is Stupid.Kidman is the token sexy woman in power, incessantly battling to be taken seriously in a Man's World &#150; until man-toy Clooney turns up and cows her with his head-waggling and tacit indications that she might soon be allowed to touch People's Sexiest Man Alive 1997. But they get too busy to get busy, barking orders at everyone within modeling distance, as is the manner of Nuclear Threat movies walking through office hallways hastily (glass doors and staircases, add extra points), handing off reports, getting reports handed to them, hectoring underlings to get the President or the head of That Department on the phone, reeling off statistics and information to each other, extras with one line updating them on the crisis situation (oh joy! &#150; one step closer to a SAG card!) &#150; doesn't anyone in the star's walking trajectory ever have something that they should actually be doing at the time they're lining the star's route being barked at? Meanwhile, something of world-shaking import is happening &#150; but in Nuclear Threat movies I can never quite scare up the interest to find out what. Ultimately, the Russian plot to blow up the United States grinds to a standstill through the efforts of the poreless Kelly (whose bra is always tantalizingly translucently apparent through her secretariat blouse) and the head-waggling of Devoe (who is air-lifted onto a truck which hangs off a bridge in classic Vehicle-Hanging-Off-Bridge position, leaving him just the right amount of time to get off before it falls).Flowerpot hats off to Devoe, as all the stolen nukes are accounted for &#150; but one! So begins the final idiot act of the movie &#150; congruent with the final idiot act of a desperate terrorist (played by a non-threatening, apathetic Marcel Iures), who has the opportunity to detonate the nuclear device in his backpack at any time &#150; keeping in mind that a bomb that powerful would do the same amount of damage no matter where it blows &#150; yet opts to mill aimlessly through New York streets, presenting himself as a target for military rooftop snipers. Despite Devoe's imprecations of Are We Not Men?!, the snipers refuse to take out the Russian, due to curly-haired American kids getting in the way (&#150; strange, that's never stopped them in real life...).When the movie has degenerated to the final chase sequence, Devoe gets to perform the action hero staple of Running Over Car Roofs and sliding over car hoods like a TV cop &#150; he even gets to knock over a bum with a shopping cart! This movie has everything!Finally we meet the star of our show &#150; The Bomb - replete with easy-to-read big red digital numbers ticking down (Sesame Street was so proud they dedicated a sock puppet to Devoe), which Julia must defuse. And the big red numbers only give us two minutes to think about how predictable this whole scenario is &#150; as if the film-makers would risk mussing Nicole Kidman's makeup by having a bomb explode in her face. But wait! &#150; there's more malarkey to digest we are told &#150; via Julia's harried and wholly specious dialog &#150; that this contraption is a bomb within a bomb; that there is a small normal bomb that they can detonate which will actually negate the detonation of the nuclear bomb &#150; I'd like to slap someone now, please - so we can still have our happy ending (the big convenient explosion) and yet save civilization! Diving through a stained-glass window with an explosion at your heels apparently only sustains a few minor scratches to the forehead, no worse than falling off your bike on some soft grass. It's a beautiful, beautiful world!Let us not forget the pat Hollywood epilogue Julia does laps in a pool while Devoe appears to make energy-dome innuendo about whipping it good! after she emerges. Not that she has any choice in her future bed-partner. As Devoe once sang, Freedom of choice is what you want / Freedom from choice is what you got.

Good question and one that I can't really come with a good answer to . I could point out that the bad guy is a White European Christian but if I remember correctly the plot of THE SUM OF ALL FEARS was changed so instead of Arabs we had WASPish Neo Nazis as the bad guys . In fact I'm struggling to remember when the bad guys weren't whacko white guys , would it be GOLDFINGER by any chance ? I guess the movie deserves some credit in mentioning the motives of the villain who is misguided rather than evil , and the motives don't exactly put the United States in a very good light but of course it's left to an American special forces officer to save the day and yes there's a scene where the hero attempts to defuse a bomb that has a timer that helpfully lets the audience know how many seconds are left to detonation YAWN THE PEACEMAKER isn't a terrible movie . In it's favour it's much better than another Hollywood blockbuster dealing with the Balkans conflict namely BEHIND ENEMY LINES but is in no way comparable to something like SAVIOR .

Clooney seems like an actor of modest talent but an affable guy, whose part here could have been handled by Willis.  Kidman probably has more range and is definitely more decorative.  (Her nose seems to have been professionally drafted by someone with a set of transparent plastic French curves.)  Iures is frankly charismatic, on the order of Yves Montand, and is the only character given any developmental background.  That is to say, the performances aren't bad -- but the movie is. Where to begin.1.  We meet Clooney at a Senate hearing while he is being asked to account for his arrest during a fist fight in a saloon in the company of a foreign spy and a prostitute.  He's one of those roguish wisecracking mavericks we are supposed to like immediately.  (In case you don't like fist fights, foreign spies, or whores, he has an explanation that absolves him of depraved tastes.)2.  The dialogue is ineffable.  We've got AUTHORIZATION, boys!  Let's ROCK AND ROLL!3.  The writers were unsure of who to pin the blame on so they spread the guilt around generously.  There are the Russians of course, since we can't seem to get over the Cold War.  And then the German are shown hard at work doing evil, a stretch, true, but still World War II was no pink tea.  The chief villain describes himself as a Serb, a Croat, and a Moslem.  Iraq is brought up in the first few minutes, and the stolen nukes are headed towards Iraq.  North Korea was not invited to the party.4.  The action scenes were I'm sure generated by computer.  A truck entering a bridge is blasted by a helicopter, swerves wildly, knocking down utility poles and whipping around cables that emit sparkling fountains, before finally smashing through the railing and being jolted to a halt by the cables now wrapped around its axle.  Clooney is dropped onto the truck bed by cable from a helicopter.  A surving villain knocks the pistol out of his hand and we get the obligatory shot of it skidding across the floor out of reach.  Another fist fight while the cables snap their stops one by one and the truck dips farther off the edge of the bridge.  (Cf., the elevator scene at the beginning of Speed.)  The helicopter crew decides the truck is about to take its final nose dive and they yank Clooney back up, but the cable was somehow wrapped around his neck and is strangling him, so he whips out a knife and cuts the metal cable in one swipe.  He drops back into the truck, finishes off the heavy, saves the stolen nukes, and the truck finally pulls loose of its encumberances and drops towards the gorge below, exploding halfway down, and leaving a Harvard-educated Pakistani astrophysicist dangling from a bridge girder.  (None of this is made up, I swear.)5.  Clooney, Kidman, and an accomplice complete a dangerous theft and make off happily in their car.  The accomplice mentions that they are in an embassy car so it's armor plated and has bulletproof windows.  I leave you to guess whether this datum turns out to be important in the next 60 seconds.6.  Those cars skidding and twirling and pirouetting along the rain-slick streets of Vienna, the driver, Clooney, having presumably learned his skills at the feet of Remi Julian or however it's spelled.7.  Iures intends to explode a nuke at the UN Building but is wounded and goes to ground a few blocks away.  Clooney poses the perfectly reasonable question of why Iures just doesn't blow the thing up now, since it will take out half of New York City.  Kidman shouts back, You don't UNDERSTAND.  That's not what he wants.  He wants his death to MEAN something!  Well, you can tell just from this exchange that Iures is a man of no mean principle.  Looked at pragmatically, a few hundred yards would make little difference, and nobody would be left alive to tell whether Iures had reached his goal or not anyway. Where was I?  Oh yes, number eight.  Thank you.8.  Iures is now dead on the altar but his warhead or whatever it is is timed to go off in a few minutes.  We know this because there is a red digital readout that tells us how much time is left.  All exploding devices have red digital readouts.  Why?  That's a deeply profound question. Kidman must figure out how to disarm the primer so that only the pre-primer will explode (or something).  She hacks at the fiendish device with fingernails, screwdriver, and pistol butt, while Clooney counts aloud the number of seconds remaining.  Nine.  Eight.  Hurry up!  Seven.  Doing the countdown in a situation like this, it's true, is a dirty and thankless task, but somebody's got to do it!My mind is so benumbed by exposure to radiation leakage that I can no longer count past eight.  I don't think the producers of this piece of derivative stereotypical commercial garbage could either, unless the number were preceded by a dollar sign.

Director Mimi Leder in her cinematic debut struggles with a second-hand, warmed over story. The cliffhanger predicaments and their resolutions emerge as more hackneyed and pretentious than virile and exciting. Enough with these adventure sagas set in the new Russia! Few surprises enliven this downbeat, humorless, technical Tom Clancy clone. Although The Peacemaker boasts a couple of decent scenes, the film grovels under a heavy-handed script, dull villains and equal opportunity his'n her plotting. The Michael (Crimson Tide) Schiffer screenplay follows the strenuous efforts of U.S. Army Special Forces Lieutenant Colonel Tom Devoe (George Clooney of ER) and scientist Dr. Julia Kelly (Nicole Kidman of Far & Away) to recover 10 nukes that corrupt Soviet General Aleksandr Kodoroff (Aleksandr Baluyev 0f Deep Impact) has purloined. The action ignites with sizzling promise as a team of commandos armed with machine guns and night goggles stages a daring night train robbery. With the red laser beam sighting systems on their guns and the twinkle of red from their night vision equipment, they manage to evoke an evil, sinister look. General Kodoroff explodes one of the nukes to delay the response time of the authorities, so his henchmen and he can spirit the stolen warheads out of Mother Russia.Meanwhile, an assassin guns down a member of the Bosnian parliament scheduled to attend a United Nations peace conference. Piano teacher Dusan Gavrich (Marcel Iures of Hart's War) replaces him. Dusan's wife and child die as innocent bystanders in a street shooting; Dusan resolves to spread the tragedy of Bosnia beyond his borders so the world can experience his pain and anguish. His cohorts lay claim to one of Kodoroff's nukes. Dusan intends to sneak a warhead into the United States and trigger it at the United Nations. Consequently, as one of the members of the Bosnian diplomatic team, Dusan represents the title character.The Peacemaker evolved from journalistic exposes by political reporters Andrew and Leslie Cockburn. Schiffer's predictable script recycles familiar elements from the 1983 James Bond thriller Octopussy where the villains attempted a nuclear blast to inflame the anti-nuclear protest groups and compel Western nuclear disarmament. Of course, The Peacemaker occurs against the backdrop of the anything goes 'new' Russia, a setting a little overdone recently by GoldenEye, The Saint, Crimson Tide, and The Hunt for Red October. The stolen nukes theme can be traced back to the 1965 Bond epic Thunderball as well as the more recent John Travolta extravaganza Broken Arrow. The reliance on satellite technology as well as cooperation between the military and civilians at the highest levels of the government has the Clancy imprimatur inscribed on it. Little more than Jack Ryan with a sex change, Nicole Kidman's Dr. Julia Kelly combines literary detective Nancy Drew with the sexy 1960s TV heroine Honey West.Feminist touches such as allowing the characters to savor quiet moments when they can cry are out of character for this kind of adventure that DreamWorks has served up. The Peacemaker could be accurately described as a macho chase melodrama that collides with a soapy chick flick. Quite often Leder aims for the cerebellum when she should smash the solar plexus. The best scenes in The Peacemaker bristle with volatile action. Nevertheless, even they falter between the lack of zip in the directing and the absence of zing in the plot.Composer Hans Zimmer deserves credit for a strident but pulsating instrumental score that effectively strokes the film's action sequences. The demolition derby in the streets of Vienna is still a yawner, marginally redeemed by Clooney's bad boy antics. Clooney's Lt. Col. Devoe cannot miss a shot until the end of the movie when he fails inexplicably to nail a full-sized man scrambling past him in an alley! If sobbing heroes and heroines aren't enough, director Leder and scenarist Schiffer deploy a villain who is more of a sob than an S.O.B. As Dusan Gavrich, Iures creates a bland antagonist. He resembles the later horror movie icon Boris Karloff, and he looks incredibly lugubrious with his totem mask of a face. There's nothing charismatic about Dusan, so the filmmakers have stacked the cards in this drama against themselves. You cannot really hate the Dusan Gavrich character in a way that a great villain should be despised.When Leder stresses the human elements in The Peacemaker, she allows her audience to think instead of react. Thinking audiences are less susceptible to the hokey roller-coaster machinations that convulse The Peacemaker. In a good adventure movie, audiences mentally dodge what the heroes must physically evade. Moreover, members at an action movie are better served when they flinch instead of furrow their brows. Otherwise, they'd realize how phony the predicaments are and that they could never occur in real life. Our heroes deduce who the terrorist is with a nuke in his backpack, but they underestimate him so often that their efforts strike a ludicrous note. When somebody dies in the line of action, our hero and heroine break down and cry.Even the title The Peacemaker with its inherent irony not only conveys little pizazz, but also its significance may be lost on audiences. Director Leder well-intentioned message about the horrors of a nuclear blast would make a better disaster of the week television movie than a globe-trotting Clancy/Bond wannabe thriller. Undiscriminating audiences looking for a distracting bit of action with exotic scenery and juvenile heroes may appreciate The Peacemaker until the tragedy dampens the aura of escapism. Veteran action adventure moviegoers will find The Peacemaker more disappointing than tolerable. For all the film's smart moves and cool looking imagery, The Peacemaker is too derivative to be a milestone in the thriller genre.

I actually took to the movies to appreciate George Clooney, and have since 1997's The Peacemaker.While this movie didn't get a lot of hype or admiration, I truly had a good time. Loved the wit and snappiness of Clooney's dialogue, the action, suspense and drive of the characters. While it's not perfect and has that annoying An Improbable Jump Through Solid Glass to Escape scene that I always doubt and some omitted scenes that would've been awesome to see &#x96; i.e. two trains colliding, it was an enormously fun ride that, surprisingly, still holds up today, 16 years later.The plot is the norm with a extensive plan, terrorists seize a nuclear bomb and it's up to two unlikely government heroes to work together, on a global scale, to find out where they're headed, what they're up to and why. What stands this above the rest, was a fresh and young Clooney doing his soon-to-be normal, but great, schtick.I happen to be a fan of his cocky, but smart, ambitious but laid back appeal. So, I always give him a pass. And this movie contains one of my ALL TIME favorite movie scenes (mild spoiler) Clooney's dear friend just gets killed and after an exciting car chase leaving one terrorist barely alive, Clooney says nothing in the downpour of water, walks up to him and shoots him point blank. As much as I like snappy comeback and final last crass words, this scene completely shocked and pleased me, because this is how it should've been done in real life and in the movies.Other than that one scene, it's exciting, interesting, has a great pace and a fun puzzle to put together while watching.

As heartless an act as this may be, the character, nonetheless, is a sympathetic one.Although the movie takes place largely outside of Russia, there is even some reference to the poor conditions modern-day Russia is plagued by Russia, what a f*cking mess, God I miss the Cold War. It's both humorous and to some extent true.Armin Mueller-Stahl makes an appearance as a former Soviet general who is friends with Clooney's Tom Devoe. The romance angle between Devoe and Nicole Kidman's Julia Kelly is muted by the impending danger surrounding them. They are people from different sides of the political stratosphere, so their relationship might not last long anyway, but it does end with hope in sight, for the true romantic.Less relevant today than it was at the time it was made, the film is still a very intelligent study on foreign relations in the mid- and late nineties.

This genre vehicle was just what either needed to consolidate their bankability. Clooney's action man is a more interesting performance than Kidman's slightly confused senior intelligence suit both of them are thoroughly watchable though.The film is quite relentless &#150; it might have benefited from trying some scenes to develop their relationship outside their commitment to, er, saving the world&#133; but there's the problem, that it's rather like a feature-length episode of 24. Instead, Leder looks to modulate the drama and pace with the disjointed parallel story of the ultimate baddie, complete with children in frame and emoting at the piano (I found it all a bit contrived).So, it's all one big rush of action, punctuated with trying to work out what's going to happen next. And, as such, it's brilliantly handled. The script's good (this is the third time I've seen the film so I really paid attention) bar one or two necessary clumsy resynchronisations of the plot (Kidman claiming to have emailed herself vital paperwork lost in an explosion). The action's what makes it Clooney's picture, properly military and matter-of-fact; I for one would follow him into battle. The filming/editing helps &#150; the cross Manhattan chase is particularly good. One caveat. I know that this is a studio picture/genre flick/matin√©e blockbuster but everyone's trying to give it an edge. Why can't Hans Zimmer? I know I'm not a fan, but I did try to listen without prejudice (having seen his name up on the credits) only to be let down again with a contrived, ubiquitous score (OK the director gets the last say in when it gets used, fair cop). As a test though watch the penultimate scene as Marcel Iures' Dusan sees a busker playing Bach the impact of this carefully placed extract is much more effective than the wallpapering that we are otherwise palmed off with, not least during the action sequences that least require them.

Most people find this hard to believe since the film suffered from lack of press and was sadly underexposed when it was released. The plot is intricate yet credible. The storyline revolves around stolen ss-18 nuclear warheads from a dismantled Russian missile.  It is Col. T Devoe (US Army intelligence liason and Special Forces/ George Clooney) and Dr .

The many different cultures involved are presented in a reasonably unbiased manner and fit really well with the overall context. Perhaps one of the nicest features of this movie is the absence of completely overdone and unrealistic 'Hollywood' stunts.  That is not to say that the movie is low-budget or cheap, because it is not.  This movie is proof that a producer, director, and writer with vision, taste, and intelligence count for alot more than $80million and a bunch of laughable stunts.This movie reminds of the early James Bond movies in that it is truly international with many governments and malcontents involved, albeit without the outrageous twists. It is a terrific movie, George Clooney and Nicole Kidman were perfectly cast, and it is refreshing that throughout the search for the warheads the 2 leading characters are not overwhelmed with notions romance, as too oftens happens in movie where this would probably be the last thing on the characters mind.

I saw Deep Impact in 2000 or 2001 and liked it so much. Especially the scenes which the meteor comes down to the earth were dazzling and glorious. However, The Peacemaker is her masterpiece. George Clooney is great in this film, he is a great actor, especially his mimics. Yes, any actor can play this role, Thomas Devoe, but Clooney is a gift I believe. Action? A critic says that The Peacemaker is one of slow paced movies, so in the bonus disc, in the behind the scenes part, we can watch making of two action scenes. A big lie! How many action scenes does The Peacemeker have? Let's count. The first action sequence is a car chase. This scene is so stylish. Mimi Leder chose a cloudy, rainy day to shoot this part, the cinematography consists of gray tones mainly. The background music is sweeping, the crash moments are very strong, and generally it is not showy. Thomas Devoe squeezes the car almost. The second long action sequence occurs on the air and then in an aircraft. The third action sequence (attention, I always use sequence, not scene) takes place in New York. In those scenes, Leder catches dazzling panoramic views. And this time, she chose a sunny day. However, there is a thought provoking and frustrating scene. There is a little girl who obstructs the visual angle of the sniper, but Clooney and Kidman insist him to shoot. Returning to the action, the camera follows Clooney while he is jumping from one car to another, then makes a half rotation around him. Brilliant! The gunfight scene recalls John Woo movies.

The stars are good-looking, the locations are global, the action is polished and improbable, and the music is fittingly rousing. There isn't a shred of freshness about the picture, but it fills the time efficiently.In this offering, the hero is George Clooney, a slightly dangerous American soldier who believes in action first, negotiations later. He is partnered with a lady agent, Nicole Kidman, who believes in negotiations first, action later. Together they race around Europe, the Middle East, and ultimately the streets of Manhattan, in an effort to track down ten stolen nuclear warheads. As it turns out, one of the warheads has found its way into the hands of a Bosnian fanatic who plans to wipe out the United Nations and the surrounding city blocks in a nuclear holocaust.The film begins in gloomy, messy fashion, with lots of dimly lit scenes of murder, assassination and treachery, as the whole complex theft gets underway. For a good hour or more, it isn't very good, but it finally lights up with a violent car chase sequence in Austria. Then there's a further slow patch, before another decent action sequence in which US army choppers invade Soviet air-space to pursue a truck carrying some of the lost weapons. The finale is actually the best segment in the whole film, a taut and well conceived hunt for the walking bomb as he makes his way through crowded streets ever closer to the steps of the UN building.

The concept of nuclear warheads, slipping into the wrong hands does very much exist, although in current times this may more likely come from Pakistan, or any variety of rogue states who could acquire such through third party brokers. As a side note, any of these types of nuclear devices do require periodic refurbishing, the details of which I won't elaborate on, but after a certain length of time, the capacity for thermo-nuclear detonation does diminish.Having said all that, does the film realistically portray any of this actually translating into a potential situation? Well . . . not exactly, but I think it's interesting that at least the concept was presented in a not overly ridiculous fashion. Sadly, with tremendous irony, I noted the twin trade towers in several of the background scenes. How odd it is that history often unfolds in the least expected ways. It was, after all, not a miniaturized nuke that was the greatest act of terrorism and evil ever perpetrated on US citizens, but rather planes filled with people . . . and boxcutters as the weaponry of terror.Was the film entertaining?

Past experience's have led him to believe that things are more or less black and white, and he has no time or patience for pencil pushers. She's the brains while he's the loaded gun, and Clooney has no problem essaying the part. Clooney brings some of his charm to the part, but only when circumstances allow. He's also effective as an action hero, and when he has to show his soft side. Armin Mueller-Stahl is wasted in the small part of Devoe's friend, Dmitri Vertikoff, but at least he's in it.As good as The Peacemaker is, it's not perfect. The fault mainly lies with the handling of the villain. The main villain, Dusan Garvich is ably portrayed by Marcel Iures, but director Mimi Leder attempts to make Garvich better rounded by humanizing him. While sometimes this approach works, it doesn't here. It weakens him and makes him less frightening. Personally, I found Aleksander Kodoroff (Aleksander Baluyev) to be more fearsome. Kodoroff is a pure psychopath; all he cares about is money. How he gets it or who he has to kill for it means nothing to him. Nor for that matter do the motives of those who pay him to do their dirty work.Still, The Peacemaker is a tremendously effective thriller. The premise is golden, and the film exploits it for all its worth.

There was a wild car chase scene where George Clooney is being pursued by two cars. They were driving at breakneck speed, crashing their way through a main city square, firing bullets, knocking down structures and terrorizing innocent people who just happened to be in the area (it was a crowded plaza). The scene took about 5 minutes in film time, as George Clooney kept backing into his pursuers after their vehicles stalled.And yet, despite all this mayhem in the middle of a busy and centrally located city plaza, mayhem that, I stress again, goes on for several minutes, NO POLICE EVER SHOW UP!!! I realize that if they did then the movie might have ended prematurely and would have been a lot less dramatic, but these are the types of things that make me cynical about the filmmaker.

Don't let that put you off though as the story, while somewhat clich√© is exciting.The opening sequence where a train full of commandos pulls along side a train carrying nuclear warheads on their way for disposal and transfer most of them from one train to the other was exciting. When they detonate one of the bombs to hide their crime from the Russian authorities the detonation gets the attention of the US. At first it is thought that it is a terrorist attack but soon they realise it was just cover for a robbery. In charge of the US investigation is newly promoted Dr. Julia Kelly assisted by Lt. Col. Devoe, played ably by Nicole Kidman and George Clooney.What follows is a thrilling adventure as they first go to Vienna to meet up with an old friend of Devoe's and follow up a lead about a Russian general who officially died on the train but had apparently phoned his girl friend afterwards. When Devoe's friend is gunned down they flee in his car and what follows is a fairly spectacular sequence where the assailants pursue Devoe and Kelly but end up dead in a Vienna square.Now our heroes know where the bad guys are going and what vehicle they are in the move to intercept it, the only problem is the bad guys are still in Russia and Devoe and his choppers don't have permission from the Russians to cross the border. Of course he crosses anyway and is able to retrieve all but one of the weapons. This weapon eludes them and finds its way to the hands of a Bosnian who intends to detonate it in New York.Like all such thrillers it lacks believability if one thinks too much about it but that doesn't matter as it is such an exciting story with good heroes and villains. Talking of villains it was nice to see that the main villain wasn't really a bad man, but a good man broken by the effects of war. It was also nice to see a film where there is no romantic involvement between the leading lady and the leading man. I'd definitely recommend this to fans of spy thrillers in the Bond mould.

As the nineties drew to a close, both groups decided that, in the absence of any serious alternative candidates, the Russians and their fellow-Slavs in Eastern Europe could continue to serve as the enemy. Hence, on the one hand, the Kosovo war and, on the other hand, films like The Peacemaker. (Russians also feature as the villains in other thrillers from this period, such as Crimson Tide and Air Force One).The Country and Western song The Devil's Right Hand contains the line called the peacemaker but I never knew why. The reference in the song, of course, is to the Colt 45 pistol, but the line could equally well apply to this violent action-adventure thriller which has little to do with making peace. The basic plot is that an evil Russian general has stolen a nuclear warhead and sold it to a Bosnian Serb terrorist, who intends to detonate it in Manhattan. The only people who can thwart this plot are the World's Number 1 Male Sex Symbol (as an American army officer) and his female counterpart (as an American intelligence agent).Apart from the inappropriate title, there were two things that surprised me about the film. The first is that a film in this very macho genre should have been directed by a woman, Mimi Leder. There is actually a discussion on this board about how different the film might have been if it had been directed by a man. (The whole discussion, in fact, seems to be based upon the questionable assumption that all action thrillers are directed by Kubrick-type auteurs who retain complete artistic control over any project they work on, but I will let that pass).The consensus view seems to be that a male director would have introduced a romance between George and Nicole and would have ended the film with a full-scale shootout. If Ms Leder was indeed responsible for the decision to omit any romantic sub-plot, I think that decision was the right one, as any such romance would have interfered with and slowed down the main action and made the film even longer than it is already. (At over two hours it probably exceeds the optimum length for a thriller of this type). There does not, however, seem to be any point in avoiding the standard clich√© of the final shootout if you are going to replace it, as is done here, with the equally hoary clich√© of the race against time to defuse a ticking bomb, which helpfully comes complete with a digital readout showing precisely how many minutes and seconds remain before Armageddon. That plot device was pretty corny even when it was used in the Bond vehicle Octopussy more than a decade earlier.The second thing that surprised me was that that arch-liberal George Clooney should have agreed to appear in what is essentially propaganda for the role of America's armed forces in keeping the world safe from the Great Russian Bear and its Slavic allies. The Russian general is portrayed as so evil that he is prepared to destroy part of his own country with a nuclear bomb in order to make a quick buck. By rights the Serb terrorist Gavric, prepared to destroy part of someone else's country in order to make a political point, should be portrayed as even more evil, given that he intends to destroy not a remote area of the Ural Mountains but a city of some eight million people. In fact, the film makes a misguided attempt to humanise Gavric, who makes a video explaining his actions in terms of revenge for the killing of his wife and child by a Muslim sniper, but never succeeds in making him sympathetic, or even particularly understandable, and certainly never makes any coherent point about the origins of the Bosnian War. I suspect that the intention was to make the film look like a serious statement about terrorism, so Clooney could make a shoot-'em-up thriller with a clear conscience and without his fans assuming that he had followed other action heroes like Chuck Norris, Rambo Stallone and Arnie the Terminator into the Republican Party.In any case, Clooney is not particularly good in this film, coming across as too laid-back and nonchalant. This style of acting has served him well in comedies such as One Fine Day and Intolerable Cruelty, but it can be a problem in thrillers such as this one and Ocean's Twelve. (To be fair to George, virtually the whole cast in Ocean's Twelve were so laid back they were practically horizontal). Nicole Kidman is rather better, but has less to do.Leder handles the various action sequences competently, but the film as a whole, with its predictable plot and outdated political attitudes, never arouses much interest. Crimson Tide works much better as a post-Cold War thriller because, by not showing the Russian villains and confining the action to an American submarine, it manages to find a new angle on its subject-matter.A final word about the music. Prokofiev (or, according to another version of the story, Stravinsky) once said of Rachmaninov that he had not written a hundred different works, merely the same work a hundred times. I am starting to get the same feeling about Hans Zimmer; once you have heard one of his film scores, you have heard them all. 5/10 "},{"Title":"Decent enough, nothing earth-shattering","Date":"19 August 2008","Score":"","Genre":"Action, Thriller","Review":" If there was a movie that you could say followed the plot step-for-step by the manual, this would be it.

Mostly it was a hectic and overlong, nervous and excited movie.A Russian has hijacked 10 nuclear warheads that he's transporting for sale, with one going to a Serb-Croat-Muslim who intends to detonate it at the UN building. Kidman is the Executive Branch operative and Clooney is the military operative. The story takes on James Bond proportions as they seek out what's going on and then attempt to stop it. There are 2 or 3 climaxes that extend the story's length. After awhile, I was fast-forwarding through the predictable chase scene in NY City.There is quite an elaborate car chase scene in Serbia (I think) in which Clooney uses the car to destroy three cars in pursuit. This scene works well. Clooney handles his part nicely. He never fails to know what to do and acts very quickly. Kidman keeps up with him.The movie glorifies the U.S. technical prowess. The depictions are unreal and fantastic, if not ridiculous. It makes for propaganda.Nuclear warheads on American soil in terrorist hands are the ultimate U.S. nightmare, and so that's what the movie shows. In a moment of realism, we learn that the terrorist is attacking NY out of retaliation for US and NATO interference in the old Yugoslavia and the deaths of his family. It's called blowback. The other U.S. bugaboo is Iran (horror! horror!) and so another plot element is warheads headed for Iran.It's all strictly comic book level and by the numbers action, a popcorn feature. Nothing deep here except sell tickets and pay the upkeep of the producers, staff and movie makers.

The plot is a good one - some Russians set up a train wreck in order to get nuclear warheads, destined for detonation, to a Bosnian diplomat with an ax to grind - he blames the west for the deaths of his wife and child. The U.S. special forces, led by Colonel Devoe (Clooney) manage to get all of the warheads except one. They have to find it and find it fast - it's going to be used on the United Nations.The first part of the film is the most exciting, showing the setting up of the train disaster. Then the focus is on the U.S. nuclear expert, Dr. Julia Kelly (Kidman) as she is temporarily put in charge of the situation and comes up against Devoe, a smart aleck with some passionate ideas. The two work together toward a common goal.There are some very tense and exciting scenes in this film and some great special effects. Both the stars are very good. What I didn't care for was the stereotypical relationship between Devoe and Kelly - the instant dislike, his aggressiveness and his backing down when he realizes how smart she is. I realize there is a need for a dynamic between the two at first meeting, but why does it always have to be dislike and/or a turf war? These are two people in a world crisis who have to work together but approach the crisis by different means. Instead of using the man/woman tension shorthand, how about meeting as equals and arguing? He can notice she's a woman and a looker later when their strategy is in place.Basically I liked The Peacemaker, but for me there was not enough character development and too much dependence on special effects to make it really great. I guess I'm spoiled from watching too many old movies where characterization was more important than blowing things up.

One is that as well as Nicole Kidman does her American accent (and as delicious as she looks), she was simply too young for the role. I had already thought of Sigourney Weaver when I read the comment below with which I totally agree. Linda Fiorentino would have been another excellent choice. In fact, it would have been very interesting to see Clooney with an older actress such as Anne Bancroft - after all, there is no real love story in the movie. Kidman looks so very young in this movie that it seems as if the White House is represented by a high school senior. The second is that there are no real twists in the movie. We know who the villains are instantly - it might have been more interesting to have some others surprisingly implicated (e.g., Clooney himself?). The movie is on a relatively simple plain - no ambiguous motives, no world-weariness - simply good and bad (though they do a nice job of giving some sympathy to the Serb villains).

Kidman plays Dr. Julia Kelly, a nuclear scientist and the acting head of the White House Nuclear Smuggling Group. Clooney is Lt. Colonel Thomas Devoe, an intelligence officer with the U.S. Army's Special Forces, who seems to have an amazing knowledge of Russians. They join forces to track down not only the weapons, but also why they were stolen. The story is very complicated and with all the foreign names, you really need to pay attention to figure out who is who. The story travels from the U.S. to Bosnia to Russia to Austria and back to the final climax in New York City.The story, while confusing at times, is actually quite good. I think it's the first one to deal at all with the situation in Bosnia, and it also takes advantage of the usual bad guys in American film, the Russians. The thing I liked best about the movie was that it was non-stop action. First time film director Mimi Leder, is a converted T.V. director, known mostly for her work on E.R. She takes that non-stop E.R. style to the movies, and it works quite well, the movie doesn't let up for a second. And George Clooney proves to me once again that he is a movie star. He has a presence about him that the top actors in the field have. Like Tom Cruise or Mel Gibson, he has an easy-going nature about him, but whenever he is on screen he commands attention, but doesn't overpower the screen like a Stallone would.Kidman manages not only to hold her own in the movie, but at times (especially the end) she takes control of the film, which is rare for a woman to do in an action-adventure. And most importantly, in most movies when you put two good looking people like Kidman and Clooney together, there is usually a stupid attraction sub-plot running along throughout, but thankfully this time, there isn't. The Peacemaker is a good, edge of your seat thriller that grabs you from the start and never lets go. Check it out.

Character development is very limited, despite some initial hope (the flowers from Kidman's ex) setting up a potential avenue for sexual tension between the lead roles, this is not mentioned again, so why put it in the film? The lack of enjoyment I felt during this film was not down to the acting performances, however, it more the result of a script that was as thrilling as washing the dishes.Nuclear warheads are stolen by a Russian general who opposes his governments decisions to comply with the west's demands and is now only in it for the money (although, we find out later that there is another villain interested in one of the warheads). It is unclear until the last 20 minutes of the film why Marcel Iures' villain wants to attack the west.There are other little annoyances, such as poor subtitling I shouldn't of... is just something that someone is payed to get correct, making the film seem a little cheap at times. Other distractions are some of the gaps in the plot, I have no idea what caused the authorities to raid Iures' house, finding the vital clue to his target. At one point he is being asked to step in as the only alternate, and the next his home is raided. I also find in impossible to believe that a diplomat from Bosnia would be able to smuggle a nuclear bomb into the US without setting off a single security measure.

For example we have the typical cursing every time something bad is said or a gun is fired, we have the typical screaming sidekick teamed up with the unfazed hard man (Kidman and Clooney), and as well we have the run 'with only ten seconds to spare' and jump as the bomb explodes in the background, as a matter of fact we have that twice. It is a slight shame really considering the opening sequence is very well done, but the pacing there on in just drags until the next set piece which is then followed again by slow pacing before the next set piece. This can only be a fault in the writing where we are literally given all the stereotypes of this type of film in one two hour block. The best part about the writing is the B story involving a diplomat who has an agenda for his deadly act. The story is dripped in slowly at the beginning and then brought to the forefront for the final act. It is the best part about the story as it is something slightly different than your typical Russian baddie plot; however it isn't particularly the norm that a B story actually completely overtakes the main plot of a film for the final thirty minutes of it. It makes the opening ninety minutes feel a little clunky and shows how weak the main plot actually is.Some of these issues could be down to the direction, which although not entirely bad does seem a little flat. Mimi Leder does manage to get a decent performance from Clooney but Kidman doesn't seem out of her comfort zone. The opening sequence is very well directed, and the music really adds to the drama, but the other action sequences seem pretty lifeless, especially the chase scene through the streets of Vienna. Also something that was heavily noticed whilst watching was the amount of time taken to chase this man throughout New York without the bomb going off when he had put a time limit on the bomb for a much shorter amount of time. Put it this way an entire third act which is about twenty minutes of screen time told us it was only about seven minutes in their world. It was definitely not plausible and there is a way they could have got over this.The film isn't entirely bad but there is enough wrong with it to make it not particularly good. The tired clich√©s really take over after such a promising start to proceedings. The film could have, and probably should have, been better but the lifeless way in which the story was told, and the dull action sequences, really hindered the possibilities the film could have had. The music was one of the standout points, composed by Hans Zimmer, and from knowing his work in this day and age it is very obviously his work and the soundtrack booms over every tiny piece of action, unfortunately the action fails to live up to the score. I can't particularly say I was disappointed with this film as the opening scene was definitely one I was pleased to have seen, the thing is I could have happily turned it off after the opening twenty minutes and have ended up seeing a much better film.2 / 5For more reviews www.tolli-movieworld.blogspot.com "},{"Title":"POSSIBLE SPOILER  The Credibility Leap","Date":"8 April 2006","Score":"1 out of 3 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Thriller","Review":" I liked this movie.

I could suspend realism to accept Nicole as a beautiful, brainy, brunette bombshell (pun intended).

But the one thing I COULDN'T accept was Clooney being a li'l LTC and having all of the command powers he seemed to have. In real life, this would require him to be at least a full-bird COL.And let's face it, whether they realized it or not, the writers fashioned Clooney's character after none other than a free-wheeling, unbridled COL Ollie North if he were given unbridled power. (Okay, he was a Marine, not in the Army.) But, still, I think credibility wise I could have accepted things a lot better if despite all of the free-wheeling carting of nukes around the world, the ability to identify the number off a license plate from a satellite camera (and presumably the nose hairs on Osama Bin Laden but we still can't find him), and everything else, if they had only had Clooney be a full-bird COL from the get-go.

What makes this movie a very good non-art-flick is the acting and the directing - Nicole Kidman is never 'the girl' and she is believable as an intelligent, strong woman. Neither she nor the director ever let her get shrill or competitive, and her vulnerability is just plain REASONABLE, never 'girly.' The scene that grabbed and kept me watching was early on - when Kidman's character is given complete authority, the feeling of being alone and vulnerable was palpable - truly a great scene for a director and actor, regardless of the quality of the movie.George Clooney was, as others have said, excellent - never a testosterone-driven one-dimensional soldier. He acted and sounded like all the soldiers I've known - never any subtlety or color in his conversation, but truly a human, nonetheless. Can George Clooney act badly? Haven't seen any evidence of it yet!The director kept the plot moving along, not so fast that it became muddled or confusing, and not so slow that it was boring. She allowed actual character development - something missing in the genre - and kept the action scenes clean and exciting.I have absolutely no complaints about this movie, which is in stark contrast from my response to every other action thriller (except 3 Days of the Condor). I highly recommend it.

No doubt the view was not precisely _the_ one so well known from TV coverage but it looked eerily similar and given the circumstances of the movie...The plot is easy enough to follow A group of terrorists hijack 10 nuclear warheads from a SS10 ICBM. They arrange a collision between the transporting train and one packed with civilians, and detonate one warhead to cover the theft. Enter Dr Julia Kelly (Kidman) and Col. Tom Devoe (Clooney). Kelly is a spunky US presidential advisor - attractive, smart and courageous - but one who has never seen combat or watched someone die. Devoe is a battle-hardened veteran, not particularly a chauvenist but one who has little time for formality or niceties if it means terrorists escape with nuclear bombs to hostile countries. There is inevitable conflict between Kelly and Devoe.In relatively short order, 8 of the remaining 9 warheads are recovered, but only after the loss of a chopperful of soldiers. While Devoe is in the thick of it, Kelly only sees much of the action via spy-satellite. However she is appalled at the loss of life when the chopper is downed and requests a list of its occupants' names, weeping when she receives the list.The remaining warhead, or at least a crucial part of it powerful enough to destroy many city blocks with a small nuclear blast, is being couriered by Dusan Gavrich (Marcel Iures) to the UN. An unlikely terrorist, Gavrich is a professor who teaches children the sensitivities of classical piano-playing in his spare time. He and his associates (mostly family) have deep and personal reasons for their deadly intent however.The UN is not destroyed, largely thanks to Kelly's pluck and courage. Faced with vaporisation within a minute, and urged on by Devoe, she disarms the bomb with a knife!.Before I get drowned out by guffaws and belly-laughs, and in case you didn't know Nuclear bombs work by making plutonium or uranium-235 go critical in a way that a calculated amount of energy is released _before_ the bomb destroys itself. The bomb at hand is of the compression type, looking much like a miniature soccerball, a plutonium core surrounded by high explosive. The latter must implode the core in an extremely precise manner to achieve the desired nuclear explosion, hence disrupting that implosion by removing one of the imploding panels, as Kelly did with the knife, should prevent the device going nuclear (though not of course the conventional explosion). These days when many cannot distinguish technological fantasy from fiction, I wonder how many twigged to the significance of what was happening there?Judging from the IMDb business and box office data, this movie barely scraped even despite being intelligently and competently done by Mimi Leder (Deep Impact). If it had been released post 9/11 and particularly in recent times (2003/2004) it might have been a different story...JR movie fiend "},{"Title":"A Great Movie","Date":"14 November 2003","Score":"1 out of 3 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Thriller","Review":"  I'm sorry.

Clooney and Kidman are billed as names only. They begin with promising roles but soon enough they are on the run and narrowly avoiding death. Armin Mueller-Stahl makes an appearance before he is abruptly killed off. The characters are sidelined in favor of big budget explosions that basically make a lot of noise.

Buses go past with it plastered all over the side, but is it as good as they are trying to make it out to be. In a word no. I found the movie quite dry and boring, and I slept through a part of it (okay, I had had a restless previous two nights travelling between Adelaide, Melbourne, and Sydney, but if the movie was good I would not have fallen asleep). This movie did not grip me, moreover I was waiting for it to end so I could go home and sleep.The plot is pretty basic. A renegade Russian General steals some nuclear warheads because he is upset that the communist reigime has ended. Who the Russian General actually was was a little unclear. I assumed that he was killed just before they detonated the warhead, but it seemed that it was the guy who killed the Russian General. Rather confusing I'd say.Then they bring in the war between Bosnia and Serbia and things become even more confusing. They try to tie it up in the end but the threads seemed to have been to obscure to begin with. And then there is the thing about a nuclear bomb only blowing up a few blocks in New York City. Okay, that is possible as the bomb they were referring to was the detonator for a fusion bomb, but once again it was a little unclear (though I could have been asleep when this happened).Now, Nicole Kidman's character is one that I find interesting. She begins acting as if she is a woman that is strong and is able to command men. Moreso, she acts as if she will not let a man walk all over her. Then George Clooney enters and walks all over her. That type of character is interesting, but I think they did not develop it properly. I went in thinking that she was supposed to be a strong woman and when it turn out that she wasn't really that strong, I was somewhat disappointed. Yet she does have some strong points as she is able to hold George Clooney back from entering Russia.George Clooney, well, all I can say about his character was that it was very uninteresting, even quite dry. Typical special forces commander that knows everything and can do everything by himself and the only reason Kidman is in the movie is to put a pretty face beside him.

A military guy (the one that goes out there to fight) usually is a macho type, so we can take him seriously. But Kidman... Give me Moulin Rouge any day, that's her type of role (a half dressed whore), no wonder she got so many nominations. We can all take her seriously there.My choise for the role Sigourney Weaver. She was 47 at the time (a 47 year old woman is much more believable, and can command much more authority, and EXPERIENCE), and she still looks great (even now, in Heartbreakers), and is the type of woman who could boss around military guys like Clooney's character and look real. Not Kidman. Sorry but those loose pants and regular skirts didn't cut it, and as for the swimpool, when we realize that it's Kidman in the water, it's too late. Could've been Clooney in drag for all we can see on the screen, before it's too late.

Clooney, though gifted with a magnetic personality, is not exactly a heavyweight in the acting department. Next to Kidman's  performance in this movie,Clooney comes off as Laurence Olivier.Whom amongst us has never met the female in the workplace, who has an aggressive personality, yet little competence? Nicole Kidman is that sort of person.Think of all hell breaking loose, bullets flying, men dying, nuclear bomb about to off. Now imagine Kidman striding into these sorts of scenes, legs spread apart, hands on hips. Unfortunately, that is all she can do. She does not at any time project the authority, that tells you that this is a person on top of her game. She bawls orders more like a harried nursery school monitor, than a presidential advisor.Clooney grinds things out as best he can. Director Mimi Leder partially amends for casting Kidman by the high production values, and striking art direction.My advice?  Watch the movie and fast forward through Kidman's scenes. Even better, run her bits at double speed, and hear her talk funny while she acts funny.There is a decent action movie in The Peacemaker without her.

The same mannerisms are there, but he suits this hero role much better than an emotionally stunted Doctor. Kidman plays a strong second lead, for there is no one support, she's an unusually strong character . A confident woman who often takes control and is often giving orders to Clooney. Although there are a couple of grimace provoking scenes, the moment where a shot against a terrorist can't be made because of a group of Girl Guides stands out here, the plot is intelligent and very much edge-of-your-seat stuff. With modern day locations and political backdrops it makes for an exciting terrorist action film, although if you want more intelligence and less action, check out Arlington Road.

Director Mimi leder tries to show the big chase to find stolen Russian nukes (how many times have we seen that now....anway) but also has this weird melo dramatic atmosphere of what the bomber is going through emotionally and psychologically. If you are going have an action movie whats the point of making it out of point with dull melo drama (as if the movie was set to win the oscars).After all this is supposed to be fictional fun for must viewers, there is no need of making it into a paradox (especially with cheap remake of USAF helicopters).Now though this movie has some similarities with The World is Not Enough, like Nicole Kidman being the bombshell heroine and nuclear scientist she is better that Denise Richards (at least in acting...other features of her are debatable). We have George Clooney trying to be a James Bond and a John Mclane (lets not forget Die Hard folks) wannabe.If the movie just focused on the action, thrill and some comic relief it wouldn't have been that much of a flop. Clooney otherwise is okay by being the handsome, wise crack, trouble with authority army Major and boys lets not forget his sexy nuclear scientist assistant Kidman. Ok...its stereotypical but at least fun to watch......director even misses that....I give the movie 6/10.....so don't feel bad if you missed it, but watch for the sake if you have time.P.S I haven't seen deep impact (also by Mimi Leder) but I can predict why it did not do as well as Armeggedon.

In the scene when the villains were stealing the nuclear warheads, Leder did in a way to tap our imagination as to the situation going on.  In another movie, we'd probably see less than convincing train crash.One thing bugs me was when (in obvious typical cliched fashion) Clooney and Kidman had to go through a glass window.  Kidman's character sustained several cuts all over her arms (Clooney has a cut in his forehead).  And then in the ending, where Kidman does her regular exercise in the pool, she doesn't have any cuts but Clooney still has a bandage on his forehead. 2.5 of 5 stars.

The plot rattles along its predictable rails at such a pace that you may find your disbelief left somewhere down the track by the time the credits start to roll.Nicole Kidman and George Clooney put in a businesslike Odd Couple performance as the Suit and Loose Cannon and they are well backed up by the rest of the cast. The stand-out performance comes from Romanian actor Marcel Iures as a revenge-obsessed Bosnian suicide bomber. Iures is very effective at showing his character's grief and steely determination. The rest of the cast do things pretty much by the numbers, so it sometimes feels like Iures has walked in from a different film.Now the downside. Iures's character blames the USA for providing weapons to the warring states of the Former Yugoslav Republic, which is why he wants to detonate a nuclear weapon on US soil. But hang on, the Serbs, Bosnians and Croats got their supplies from Yugoslav Army stockpiles which were made in various Soviet states. The movie therefore makes an unfounded criticism of American foreign policy, as well as portraying US troops (on an incursion into Russian Federation territory to capture stolen nuclear warheads) as the World's Police. No one in the film seems to give a damn about the supposed supply of weapons to the genocidal butchers of the FYR, but the idea of nuclear weapons being driven into Iran on a truck has everyone jumping into helicopters, dying heroically etc etc. The motive for the bomb attack on New York is sidelined until it is merely an excuse for Kidman and Clooney to jump on a plane and fly back to save the USA.The climactic scenes, where Kidman and Clooney have to try and disable the dirty bomb in a New York church, are pretty laughable. I'm no physics expert but I'm pretty sure that exploding a nuclear trigger won't wipe out 10 city blocks. It will spread deadly plutonium dust over a wide area but it won't be a nuclear explosion. Therefore the film ends on a bum note. If you can suspend disbelief for a couple of hours and be swept along by the great action sequences, The Peacemaker is good entertainment. If you tend to analyse as you watch, you may wish to give it a miss.
