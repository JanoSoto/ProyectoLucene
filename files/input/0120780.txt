Lo/Jenny from the Block/Bennifer/media whore phase.Back when she used to have a little (now she has a lot), Jennifer Lopez was actually enjoyable in Steven Soderbergh's 'Out of Sight.' I saw this in the theater when it came out and remember thinking it was one of the better films I'd seen that year. I watched it again last night on DVD, and I have to say that it still holds up. Clooney is finally given a worthy vehicle, and he and Lopez have actual, undeniable chemistry on the screen. The supporting players (especially the incomparable Don Cheadle) are perfectly cast. Soderbergh effortlessly knocks this one out of the park.One critic gave the film two and a half out of four stars and claimed 'Out of Sight' was in need of a 'shot of adrenaline,' but I have no idea where he's coming from. When you think of all the bad movies that are released in any given year, you'd think you'd appreciate something like this.

Based upon the novel by Elmore Leonard (Get Shorty, Jackie Brown), the movie tells the tale of odd couple Jack Foley (George Clooney), a career criminal, and federal marshall Karen Sisco (Jennifer Lopez). After a unique first encounter, their paths continue intersecting, with various degrees of intent, to comprise the bulk of the story.Similar to the Soderburgh-helmed Ocean's Eleven, Out of Sight blends the standard apples and oranges of genres into a delicious smoothie. This is a drama, minus the driving intensity, light-hearted enough to pass as a comedy. It's a comedy, but not of the HAHA sort. The humor lies in things like Clooney's glances, JLo's relationship dilemmas, the paradox of Ving Rhames' self-righteous thief, and the sheer absurdity of Don Cheadle's gangsta. It's also a romance and a cop-and-robber story, but neither love nor crime is the whole point. All of these pieces unite to form a fantastic puzzle of a picture.The tasty complexity is further deepened by the non-linear storytelling technique. Flashing backward here and there throughout the film is a good choice because the viewer can only fully understand the previous events with the 20/20 vision of hindsight. Plus it eliminates what could have been a painful first half hour of exposition, instead spreading the backstory through the rest of the film.The stylistic singular color palettes for different locations that Soderburgh later used magnificently in Traffic are present here as well. From bright sun-drenched Florida to the ice cold blues of Detroit, this technique serves as virtual atmosphere, allowing one to determine the geography even without the convenience of titles. In a non-linear film like this, that ease in recognizing time and place facilitates comprehension of what is happening when. Unique among Soderburgh's work (to my recollection) is the film's use of occasional freeze frames. Stopping the picture for just a second or two, Soderburgh gently identifies poignant moments, obvious or not, allowing an extra moment to deservedly linger on them.With the high technical accomplishments, the acting almost doesn't matter, but the slightly understated method works wonders. Clooney is his usual suave self, complete with snappy dialogue and a cornucopia of confidence. In a role that Enough can only dream about, JLo almost looks like a real actress (joke). She is absent her too-common ditziness and easily holds her own, despite being a tad too glamorous. Rhames, Cheadle, and Albert Brooks are their usual solid selves, playing parts both similar and drastically different from their wheelhouses. Everyone seems to have perspective in their parts, not utilizing excessive gravity or levity, but rather hitting the appropriate notes as they inhabit their roles to perfection. Ultimately you believe all of these actors in their parts, even if JLo's skirts are entirely too short for a federal agent.Like Ocean's Eleven, Out of Sight is a very good film, merging quality in all aspects of film-making into a fully enjoyable two hour experience. The main themes of crime and love are basic, so the movie doesn't soar to remarkable heights. But if you're looking for a brilliantly made film that you might have missed on its theatrical run, espy Out of Sight and settle in for a quirkily involving night. If you saw it a few years back, check it out again to see Soderburgh's foundation for his own excellence.Bottom Line A wholly absorbing movie that serves as a film-making clinic of brilliance. 8 of 10.

How often in an action film does the hero miss a shot? I'm sick to death of wildly unbelievable stories, huge explosions and car chases.

OUT OF SIGHT is a little masterpiece of film-making despite the fact that when it initially screened in 1998 it seemed to slip by theatergoers' attention. Based on the inimitable Elmore Leonard novel the story begs indulgence in credible situations but shines in quality of script and characterization and an atmospheric cinematic capturing of a dark, film noir comedy drama that grabs you by the head and holds you glued to the screen for the duration.The story is rather simple on the surface - a jailed bank robber escapes with the help of his buddy and plans a major hit only to encounter a federal agent in pursuit of the two who becomes the love interest portion of this strangely convoluted tail. Subplots and sidebars are sprinkled throughout Soderbergh's telling of Leonard's story, serving to keep our minds alert and mesmerized by the plot development.The cast is absolutely first rate with George Clooney, Jennifer Lopez and Ving Rhames especially pungent in roles that seem written for them. The strong supporting cast includes such fine actors as Steve Zahn, Catherine Keener, Don Cheadle, Luis Guzman , Isaiah Washington, Dennis Farina, and Albert Brooks. And for those who enjoy powerful sexual chemistry Clooney and Lopez offer some of their finest collaborative acting. This is a fine movie and one that doubtless in time will be considered and under appreciated Film Classic.

I loved the editing--the choppy cuts and the freezing of certain scenes.  And I have never seen a better seduction scene in my life.  The supporting cast was great too, especially the incomparably zany Steve Zahn.

The humour is extremely enjoyable, the action is full of surprises and the characters, with their various flaws and weaknesses provide the movie with its strongest element.Jack Foley (George Clooney) is a bank robber extraordinaire who's spent too much of his life in prison. His modus operandi involves the use of charm and intelligence rather than guns and masks but when his getaway car fails to start after his latest robbery, he soon finds himself incarcerated in a Florida prison.He joins some other inmates in a jail break but is suddenly confronted by Federal Marshall Karen Sisco (Jennifer Lopez) who threatens to shoot him if he continues. Fortunately, Jack's friend Buddy Bragg (Ving Rhames) had also been waiting for him outside the prison and quickly bundles Karen and Jack into the trunk of his car before driving off at great speed. Surprisingly, during their time together in this exceedingly confined space, the couple develop a certain rapport and it's quickly evident that there's a strong attraction between them.During his time in prison, one of Jack's fellow inmates was Richard Ripley (Albert Brooks), an ex-Wall Street man who'd been convicted for being involved in insider trading. He'd openly told others in the prison about the $5 million worth of uncut diamonds that were hidden in his mansion in Detroit, so after the jail break, some of the escapees make their way to Detroit with the intention of robbing Ripley's house.Jack, having reached a point in his career where he felt that he could never face another spell in jail, decides to take part in the robbery as it could provide him with one last big pay day before he retires from his life of crime. Karen, however, is determined to stay on his trail and their confrontation at the Ripley mansion turns out to be both tense and unpredictable.Jack and Karen are both repeat offenders. He's had a long career of robbing banks and spending time in prison and Karen has consistently been attracted to the guys who she should be bringing to justice. They're both intelligent but also have lapses where their normally good judgement fails them. Getting involved with each other is dangerous for Jack and unprofessional for Karen. Jack also aims to profit from one last job although, by his own admission, he's never known of any criminal who's successfully achieved such a thing.Clooney and Lopez are both very good individually and sensational together as they so powerfully convey the intensity of their mutual attraction. The supporting cast are also top class. Ving Rhames is superb as Jack's good friend whose weakness is his regular need to confess his wrongdoings to his sister. Don Cheadle is faultless as a vicious ex-boxer and ruthless murderer and Steve Zahn is funny and convincing as a slurring stoner who's not very bright and also totally unreliable.Out Of Sight is a witty and offbeat film and the style of Steven Soderbergh's direction reflects this perfectly. The story about two opposites who attract each other is presented with great originality and the finished product is so engaging and enjoyable that it becomes one of those movies for which repeat viewings become irresistible.

And there are lots here, and even though they may appear for about 5 minutes (e.g. Michael Keaton, Albert Brooks, etc.), somehow we get to learn a little bit about them, to catch a small glimpse of their life.  Even the three ad guys at the bar seemed like the type you'd meet up with in real life.  If their parts were totally irrelevant to the movie, somehow they just fit anyway.How do the filmmakers achieve this effect, and how do they do it so seamlessly?  I thought the technique was by not presenting the characters to through their great accomplishments, but by their natural human faults.  I know it is wrong to love someone for their errors, we should rather love them for their virtues, etc, etc.  But I feel there is an aspect of imperfection in an individual's failures that is a major quality of what makes us human.Jack Foley (George Clooney) is a graying bank robber who, despite a sense of good nature and intelligence, does unplanned, and unarmed, bank heists and consequently spends most of his time in prison, no doubt scheming up new plans to get out.  Foley doesn't seem like the typical criminal who'd blame his anti-social habits on a bad childhood; rather, he carries a cocky, comical air of someone who does it for the heck of it, or maybe, to quote Foley, he's just not a nine-to-five kind of guy.  Karen Sisco (Jennifer Lopez) is Foley's feminine equivalent, who ignores her conscience and carries her cat and mouse games to the fullest extent, jeopardizing her career.  Sisco is very firm and bubbling with self-esteem, yet she's dating an married FBI agent who carries an arrogant, macho look on his face.Of course, I could go on forever, from Buddy's (Ving Rhames) certainly dull-witted habit of calling his sister to confess of jobs, especially one confession that got him and Foley busted, to White Boy Bob, who you'd write off as a basic bad guy character, until he does that thing to himself near the end of the movie.Now, there are many who will fault the movie for lagging, having too much dialogue, etc.  But I felt that if the movie was slowed down in any way, it was because the filmmakers took the guts to devote a little bit to create and flourish each character.  And that is why I love this film so much; this was made for an intelligent audience, for an audience that wants a little more out of dialogue, wants to get aroused without explicit sexuality on-screen (styles director Soderbergh is known for), and enjoy a good crime movie without the repetitive, drawn out gun battles.Soderbergh wanted to go mainstream with this movie, but you can only see him going deeper and deeper into film avant-garde.  Just hope those corrupt Hollywood producers, after seeing the lagging (there's that word again) box office receipts, don't get to him.10 of 10.

Up until this film both had shown promise, Lopez with her turn in the biopic Selena and Clooney in his roles on ER and in From Dusk Til Dawn. But neither had really established themselves as either quality big screen actors or as stars.One magical scene in the trunk of Lopez's car changed all of that. As soon as that scene was over you knew both were going places and by the end of the film we were looking at two of the biggest stars in Hollywood. For both actors, this was the role they were born to play. Clooney as a cool, charming, fatalistic crook Jack Foley and Lopez as sassy, sexy, tough and yet vulnerable FBI agent Karen Cisco.Adapted from an Elmore Leonard novel, the film is essentially about an FBI agent attempting to track down a master thief that she is infatuated, possibly even in love, with after being locked in the boot of her car with him during his escape. It's a premise brimming with possibilities, and in this case is executed perfectly, in no small way thanks to superb direction from Steven Soderbergh and an excellent cast.Lopez and Clooney's career- defining turns are joined by great supporting performances from Dennis Farina, Steve Zahn, Albert Brooks, Don Cheadle, Ving Rhames and Luis Guzman, with cameos from Michael Keaton and a big name African American star (who I won't name here) at the film's end to up the enjoyment still further.Out Of Sight was a great film when it came out in the late 90s, and is still just as entertaining today.

Soon after, she's trying to apprehend him, and he's working on a heist. And a thought lingers... what if they had met under different circumstances? I have not read the novel, nor any other by the author, only seen adaptations of his works. This is a quirky, light take on the crime genre, with many funny moments(if it is at times trying too hard), with a script, dialog and character introductions that are clever and sharp. It's a highly sexy film, always very naturally, as smooth as the 70's feel(aided greatly by the foot-tapping soundtrack). The acting is all spot-on, with both main cast and supporting players doing fantastic. Cheadle, Farina, Brooks... even Zahn, if he gets on your nerves at times. There are flashbacks to help set things up, establish relationships and the like.

Jennifer Lopez plays a luscious strong-willed daddy's girl federal marshall.  Was I expecting HAMLET here?  No, what I was expecting was a sensuous, electric, pulsating movie.  Well, I didn't get it. I felt there was little chemistry between the two stars, and that is killer in this kind of movie.  The most laughable scenes have Clooney standing up to genuinely dangerous looking black and white cons (isn't Clooney afraid he is going to break a nail?)  This movie could have been a hoot if it didn't contain Elmore Leonard usual mean spiritedness.  The best performances come from the peripheral players, Ving Rhames (like THAT is a surprise!), Don Cheedle, Catherine Keener, Dennis Farina, Nancy Allen (looking surprisingly fetching) and, especially Albert Brooks.  Michael Keaton is also a hoot in an unbilled cameo as Lopez's thick, adulterous boyfriend; however THAT relationship undermines the credibility of Lopez's character. The movie is confusing.  It starts with a botched bank robbery, which ends with Clooney incarcerated in the Glades Prison in Florida.  Clooney escapes, with the help of Rhames, but Lopez just so happens to be on the scene.  Lopez apprehends Clooney but is overpowered by Rhames coming up behind her (like Lopez wouldn't have been sweeping the area with that shotgun, duh?) Lopez and Clooney wind up locked in a trunk together, and they talk, as Clooney gets familiar with her thigh (like real romantic, guys.) Rhames and Clooney talk about a botched robbery (not the same robbery as the beginning, mind you), then are left behind by Lopez as she talks another thick partner into running off with the getaway car.  We then see Clooney and Rhames arriving at the hideout. Clooney soaks in a hot tub, as Lopez sneaks up, stands over Clooney with her gun drawn.  She then bends down, and Clooney kisses her, essentially pulling her into the tub.  Suddenly Lopez wakes up in the hospital. What the hell is going on? Ah, dream sequence, duh... The film flashes back and forth in time with very little sense of transition (thankfully there are no more dream sequences).  The director gives us quite a few flashes of razzle-dazzle photography and editing, none of which really adds to the excitement. I found myself squirming before this was over.      If you liked GET SHORTY, you'll probably like OUT OF SIGHT. Include me out of any more Elmore Leonard.

It has that easy, laconic, dialogue heavy yet not too dense way about it that just makes for easy watching. George Clooney, all effortless cool and swagger, plays Jack, an ex con who crosses paths with Federal Marshall Karen Sisco, a no nonsense girl who gradually finds herself attracted to Jack. Lopez is underrated as an actress and I get excited every time she has the chance to give a good genre turn (The Cell, U Turn). Their chemistry on screen is electric, especially in one sequence where they are locked in a car trunk, casually discussing movies as they each begin to become more comfortable in each other's presence. Leonard, also penning the books which would go on to become Jackie Brown, Get Shorty and FX's Justified, works with a naturalistic, free flowing form when creating his characters, and it's wonderful to see unfold on screen. Dennis Farina is sympathetic as Lopez's father, Michael Keaton shows up as another Marshall, and their is solid work from Steve Zahn, Don Cheadle, Albert Brooks, and a surprise cameo right in the end. In the world of romantic, easy going crime capers, this one stands out as memorable, bittersweet, and above all, fun.

And in that department this does not disappointment (by any stretch of the imagination). Lopez and Clooney were two people born to play these roles, and their scenes together crackle with sexual energy. And it's not just the leads; the whole movie is well-cast. Albert Brooks plays against type as a weaselly Wall Street crook, Cheadle as the underhanded ex-con with delusions of being a major criminal enterpriser (and a hateful little prick), Steve Zahn as the small-time pothead, and Ving Rhames as George Clooney's sensible half. They're all terrific. Hell, even with two smaller roles, Dennis Farina and Michael Keaton steal their respective scenes. In his screenplay, Scott Frank ably brings these characters from page to screen, shifting the narrative and bringing Leonard's distinct tone and style to the proceedings. And Soderbergh injects the film with slow-burn energy and atmosphere, between the sunsoaked Miami palette to the falling snow in Detroit. But it's Jennifer Lopez who walks away with this movie, proving (in '98) she's ready for the big time. She's Karen Sisco personified, the tough- as-nails Leonardian badass lawwoman. For my money, it's her best performance.This is a seriously cool, sexy caper flick. And as an Elmore Leonard adaptation, it ranks with the best of them.

In the first scene, we see the amazing way he robs a bank. He informs the teller that the man talking to the bank manager is his partner who will shoot the bank manager if she doesn't cooperate. She cooperates. He then says he's leaving and if she sounds the alarm, the bank manager gets it. On his way out, he stops and says something to the man talking to the bank manager, and leaves. Of course he doesn't know who the man is.This time, however, Jack can't start his car and make his getaway, so instead he gets a ride to prison. Two years later, he breaks out of prison and is accosted by a beautiful Federal agent, Karen Sisco (Lopez) who is at the prison to follow up on a case, has seen the men escape, and informs on them. Jack emerges last, wearing a guard's uniform and informs prison officials that the tunnel is clear. Another escapee (Ving Rhames) grabs Karen from behind, and both she and Jack are soon in the trunk of the car. The two talk, Sisco remaining cool, and Jack remaining flippant.The film plays with time, so we go back and forth to Jack's time in prison and to the present, which involves the robbery of a Bernie Madoff type (Albert Brooks) who, while in prison, told one of the inmates that he has uncut diamonds hidden in his home. In the present, Karen keeps showing up. She and Jack are obviously attracted to one another, but one's a bank robber and prison escapee...and one's a fed.Really excellent film with lots of situational humor and excellent characterizations, particularly from Don Cheadle, for whom Jack has been a nemesis both in prison and out. Albert Brooks and his toupees are hilarious.I'm always amused that George Clooney is compared to Cary Grant. Here, he looks so much like Tyrone Power that it's scary. (Clooney told Power's daughter that he modeled his career after her father.) As Jack Foley, Clooney is ridiculously handsome, flippant, relaxed, sexy, and charming. It's one of his better performances. He tends to be very serious in many of his films; this one shows his lighter side.Jennifer Lopez is good as Karen, a real knockout. Someone commented that she's too glamorous. No doubt, but the script called for a sexy woman. She fits the bill.The script by Scott Frank based on an Elmore Leonard novel, is excellent, and you'll be highly entertained by the quirky characters and situations.

There is so much that is done perfectly, from the screenplay to the editing. Any filmmaker can take chances, but to have the intelligence to determine what works and what doesn't is a more difficult thing to pull off. In this case a risk was taken to have a long scene near the beginning of the film take place with the two lead actors laying inside a truck. It turns out the scene didn't work.. at first. But the filmmakers went back, reshot and recut the scene, and the right choices were made and created the right mood and chemistry. This film was early in the careers of Clooney and Lopez (and Soderbergh), and there is an undeniable sizzle in the way the actors are dressed and photographed. Don Cheadle is also a standout, creating a menacing screen presence as a fast-talking and reckless hood. This film also propelled Steve Zahn's career, playing a gullible stoner whose life gets more frustrating scene after scene. Albert Brooks shows a sinister side in a small role as a rich businessman, which he reprises to a degree in 2011's Drive. Based on a novel, there is a series of set pieces, featuring unique outcomes that resemble Pulp Fiction, which no doubt had a heavy influence as it did other films during this era. There is a hit 70's soundtrack, Ving Rhames, with editing back and forth within the story. Again, these could come off as just gimmicks, but in this case it creates a more entertaining approach, primarily to add background to a character on the spot, instead of presenting the character earlier in the movie in a traditional linear way.The story has a good deal of Pulp Fiction elements, where not-too-small hoods try to commit a crime, in this case stealing a pile of diamonds hidden in a house. The film opens with a scene that actually takes place halfway through the story. Soderbergh had developed a reputation of working with A list actors intelligently, and here, he sculpts dialogue and storytelling by selective details and editing, creating character depth and growth in smart ways. He allows the actors to improvise when the spontaneity can create a spark of realism and unpredictability. This is why the approach to the love affair between Clooney, a bank robber, and Lopez, an FBI agent, works. They deal with the in-congruency of the relationship with abrupt mood changes and indecision. The same goes for the build-up to the big heist at the end. It is hard to tell who will prevail, who will die. A less smarter script might have put the female FBI agent in danger where our lovable bank robber comes to her rescue. Instead, the gender twist on the FBI agent is only briefly addressed in a more subtle way.There are many memorable lines, and some are due to the well seasoned script, that layers nuance on the characters. Rhames plays a bank robber with a soft side, and tells Clooney he needs to talk problems out by calling his sister. This makes a climactic moment between the characters at the end of the film more meaningful when Clooney tells Rhames You'll be talking to your sister for a month. All supporting characters have weight in this film, even though it ultimately is a romantic comedy. But it is the layers in storytelling that make this film many things at once; a thriller, a character study, and an art piece.

A couple of hoods (including Clooney) break out of a Florida pen and grab a U. S. Marshall (Lopez) unawares in the parking lot. Two of the inmates leap into the car and drive off while Clooney is squeezed into the trunk with Lopez. The cheeky Clooney rather enjoys the enforced contact, while the equally cheeky Lopez as the innocent victim seems a little put out. Clooney spends the time telling her about his career as a harmless thief. There is some dialog that comes perilously close to cute. After a few minutes of this, a title tells us FLASHBACK TWO YEARS EARLIER.That's as far as I got. I figured, Another comic romance involving a chase between the lady cop and the roguish hoodlum. There would be an argosy of wisecracks. There would be intermittent meetings during which they would fall in love. In the end, in all seriousness, she would talk him out of his last dangerous heist, help him capture the venomous villains who were forcing him to use his expertise in their behalf, and he would get a pardon from the governor, the Medal of Freedom, and unlimited access to JLo's cantilevered boom. There would be a sunset. A sailboat. A throbbing kiss. A final harmless one liner. Or Clooney may have been an undercover FBI agent all along.But I was wrong about the film in almost all regards. The structure was a bit complicated, true, and I was lost once or twice because JLo does, in fact, pursue Clooney and his two pals across the continent for a couple of years. But the general template was clear enough, and pretty close to what I'd expected. There is no sunset at the end but at least the warm promise of an ending that will bring Clooney and Lopez back into each others' arms.The photography (Davis) and art direction (Messina) are superb. The motel corridors in Miami are a dull flamingo pink. The snow across which an escaping dummy runs in a Detroit night scintillate under the street lamps, like a picture post card. It's really well designed and well shot.It's not a masterpiece. The baddest of the bad guys is Don Cheadle. His villainy is convincing, although his character is nothing but pure e-vil. He squishes live goldfish into pulp. Quite a few familiar faces pop up for a few lines -- Michael Keaton (my supporting player in the artistic gem, The Squeeze), Dennis Farina, Albert Brooks in a thoroughly dramatic role, Louis Guzman, Nancy Allen, and Samuel L. Jackson.Of the two leads, Lopez handles her part well enough. She has a peculiar beauty -- hefty and with strong bone structure but very feminine. I like Clooney. His performances usually (not always) have an off-hand quality about them, as if he really were throwing away his lines. I suppose he's handsome too but I'll give him a pass on that and not hate him for it. He's rather like an urbane Burt Reynolds.If you're not in an especially demanding humor, you might want to catch this. It's slight but enjoyable. It has action, suspense, romance, and some surprising smiles.

The editing is abit confusing with the back and forth flashbacks and timeline too disjointed. Overall, this is an entertaining, intelligent movie. Eight out of Ten Stars.

Out Of Sight hasn't the gleefully exuberant, oops, bloodshed of Pulp Fiction or Get Shorty (not much of it anyway), or the stunning languidity of Jackie Brown but even without marked pizzazz, Out Of Sight excels. In Out Of Sight Jack Foley (George Clooney) gets busted doing a stupid bank hold up (even though he's done a couple of hundred of them), escapes from prison but then gets mixed up with U.S. Marshal Karen Sisco (Jennifer Lopez). Foley is chasing some uncut diamonds he's heard about in prison from another crim called Ripley (Albert Brooks), but so are a bunch of other crooks. Elmore Leonard's books (other adaptations have been Get Shorty, Jackie Brown and now Out Of Sight) are full of men who are both losers and who also live on the thin side of the law. But Leonard colours these characters affectionately. Their mishaps and schemes tend to be both awful and funny. The women on the other hand tend to come out on top; they're smarter and more sensible. Out Of Sight is trashy in the nicest way. Out Of Sight of sight largely revolves around the relationship between the crook and the Marshal, between George Clooney and Jennifer Lopez.  George Clooney holds his place in Out Of Sight of sight pretty well but Jennifer Lopez again shines. Money Train, Anaconda, Blood And Wine, U Turn and now Out Of Sight have established the New York born actress as one of  the best on the big screen these days. She adds wit and strength to a part which could have easily been flat, and didn't have to emphasise either her Latino heritage or her curvy body to do it. She makes Out Of Sight  work. And then, somehow, these crooks and their crazy schemes make sense, even if running upstairs carrying  a loaded gun doesn't.

In the opening scenes, it is all easy-breezy for him to talk through a young female bank clerk to give him the cash, only his exit plan hits a snag.During his prison-break, Jack and his loyal partner Buddy (Rhames) hold hostage Karen Sisco (Lopez), a U.S. Marshal, a burgeoning romance has been kindled between Jack and Karen, when they squeeze together inside the trunk of the vehicle on the exit route, the closeness of a confined space really works as a hotbed for sexual attraction, and they are talking about movies about Faye Dunaway and Robert Redford along the way.Karen manages to escape later, but becomes involuntarily preoccupied with him, she follows all the leads to track him down, and finally in Detroit, their simmering affections evolve into one night of passion, but Jack's real intention is to steal some uncut diamonds from a Wall Street millionaire, Richard Ripley (Brooks), a fellow prisoner whom Jack and Buddy have met three years ago. In order to furthermore strengthen that Jack is the bad guy we are rooting for, Maurice Miller (Cheadle) is introduced, a ruthless murderer, who is also eyeing for the diamonds, with his two underlings, a cretin White Boy Bob (Loneker) and a former boxer Kenneth (Washington). The climax is a home invasion with a taut suspense and a pretty up-tp-scratch happy ending.OUT OF SIGHT is Sundance wunderkind Soderbergh's seventh feature film and his first dalliance with mainstream production (for Universal), it becomes a critical success with 2 Oscar-nominations (for editing and screenplay), the editing job of Anne V. Coates is essential to integrate the intentionally disarranged story lines to a hipster fashion which perks up the golden-hearted criminal cliché; Scott Frank's adapted screenplay puts much weight on the comedic fodder out of the dangerous work from its source novel; also ornamented by a posh soundtrack and frisky cameos from Michael Keaton - who reincarnate as Ray Nicolette from Tarantino's JACKIE BROWN 1997, another Elmore Leonard's adaptation - and Samuel L. Jackson, as the kindred spirit inmate of Jack in the code. In retrospect, it has become a breakthrough for Clooney, who radiates both civilised sophistication and childlike nonchalance, a symbol of Clooney's own raw sex appeal in its peak, and incredibly heats up the screen with Jennifer Lopez, whose often problematic acting aptitude magically works this time. Don Cheadle gives a committed impression in the villain default, and it is always nice to see Catherine Keener and Viola Davis on the screen, but personally I find Steve Zahn's outstanding portrayal of Glenn Michaels, Jack and Buddy's cowardly partner-in-crime, stands out eventually, it is a sidekick who doesn't usually deserve our compassion or even attention, but Zahn supplies him with rather empathetic efforts to cement his feelings fumbling frustration, palpable fear and an expedient sense of desperation.

Once his escape the thought has gone as planned, Foley is hunted down by Sisco, while his accomplices which includes his trustworthy assistant Buddy (Ving Rhames) and his not so reliable ally Glenn (Steve Zahn) work their ways to one of the more wealthier suburbs located in nearby Detroit. There they join forces with a suspicious business dealer named Ripley (Albert Brooks) who once sent them to jail on account of uncut diamonds found in his home. A dangerous assassin named Maurice Miller (Don Cheadle) has plans to invade Ripley's mansion accompanied his posse which includes Kenny (Isiah Washington) an White Boy Bob(Keith Loneker). While this is happening, Foley and Sisco get comfortable with each other in a Detroit hotel room where their romance is put to the test concludes in showdown as Foley enters Ripley's estate which contribute to the fun that they were having together. The question is are they in love or is Sisco pursuing to have him arrested? The first thing that caught my eye when watching Out of Sight was that it was very cool. But cool can be very hard to evaluate. I've been around movies for over 20 years and there have been equally proportioned good cool and bad ones as well. In many way, Steven Soderburgh has captured the coolness of this film as a reminiscing of the old 1960's espionage heist film that had run rampant in that time period. The cat games seem to make it very obvious. For a film to succeed in being cool, you need to convey manipulative tactics to your audience to make them think that this movie truly defines cool so that they can demand for more. By the time this movie makes it to Detroit is when the cool factor really starts to kick in and that was when I was really starting to like this film.In this movie we can all appreciate the cool things about it, but the more specific definition of the cool factor of this movie is the sexiness it brought to the screen that both genders can truly pander about. I think we all now by now that J-Lo is not that great of an actress. At best she can come across as an average performer (it may not help that her career choices in films have not always been to kind to her). But in Out of Sight I'll let the blind squirrel find his nut. In other words, she actually was pretty good here. That's mainly because Mr. Soderburgh knew that at best Miss Lopez can excel if she doesn't do very much on screen. In reality, it's the camera-work that's the real star here and it gives J-Lo the chance to reveal her sumptuous physique without really do much of anything else.On the contrary, George Clooney is a very capable and more competent performer than J-Lo and his camera-work excels better because he can still convey sex appeal to the female audience while at the same time he could back it up with versatile acting. And instead he can takes more charge to the camera than J-Lo and never lets it usurp him. So his combination of suave and talent embodies the dynamics of Clooney's repertoire.Now in most films cool and suave would surely not churn out a film that is real. But much to my surprise, Out of Sight actually has a believable story nailed into the suave and sex appeal behind and is never upstaged by it. There are some implausible scenarios that are a bit far-fetched like the climactic heist near the end of the film. But the characters succeed in keeping it real and the situations they face give us that impression as the film progresses. There is great chemistry between J-Lo and Clooney and we feel for them all the way through the film even though they're from the opposing sides of the law (opposites attract). The other supporting cast were also convincing including Ving Rhames as Clooney's trusted accomplice, Steve Zahn as the screw-up assistant and Albert Brooks as the rich nerdy guy. Behind this heist film, we have lots to believe.The camera-work was really put together quite elegantly where the rural and the urban settings really cooperate quite nicely. I thought it was quite believable that Miami looks very vibrant and colorful and while the mean streets of Detroit has the darkness dominating the streets with the exception of the odd bluish tint. And for that the cool factor comes into play with the impression that Mr. Soderbergh chose style over substance in this movie. There are a lot of crime-dramas out there that either choose, style, substance or plausibility. But in Out of Sight, we see all three come together and to me it really makes my days all the more better.

I usually find him half-baked and half-interested in what he's doing. But Out Of Sight is his most pristine and complete picture. That doesn't necessarily equate to a winner, but with Elmore Leonard's source material, it's thoroughly entertaining and slick. From Get Shorty and Justified, his style has such an endearingly casual way to approach a colourful network of energetic and morally grey characters that it's just a joy to watch even in sinister moments. Their presence may be fleeting, but they add to the personality. Working off the back of George Clooney's charm here helps, firmly establishing his typecast role for a while of handsome crook. He does it well is why. But he has a hell of a cast behind him full of familiar faces. However, beyond the intricate plotting and witty dialogue, what makes Out Of Sight special is the thoughtful editing. Usually when a film designs its structure over cutting back and forth without justification it can be jarring, but here it adds so much texture to the film, especially in a memorable intimate scene between Clooney and J-Lo. Leonard's words is what makes the film delicious subversive and engaging, but it's Soderbergh's tight touch that does it justice. Definitely worthy of its cult status over the years and most likely his finest work. 8/10 "},{"Title":"A bank robber and a romance story...","Date":"11 August 2014","Score":"","Genre":"Crime, Drama, Romance","Review":" Out of Sight is a movie that combines very well comedy with crime and a bit of romance.

I did not get that much from the movie, but it was reasonably good considering some of the movies that I could have hired (though Object of My Affection is an overnight and I really don't want to pay $3 for it when it is supposed to be an inferior copy of Chasing Amy).Out of Sight is about a superb bankrobber named Jack Foley. He is a very intelligent robber as he gets the money without having to use violence. Instead he bluffs making his victim believe that there are armed men nearby even though there are not. The robbery that we see is evidence of that, and we later discover that he robs this bank without any planning whatsoever. The problem is that his car won't start and he gets caught - but that is only a minor inconvenience to Jack Foley as he manages to escape using a failed escape attempt as a cover. Unfortunately, he is confronted by a federal marshal, Karen Sisco, whom he kidnaps and escapes with.This is where the major plot turns up. Jack falls in love with Karen and vice versa. Both know that this is a difficult relationship, one being a federal marshal and the other being an escaped criminal. In fact this is aiding and abetting a known felon - but nobody other than Jack and his confidant and Karen's father know of this relationship.This movie is about relationships - that which exists between Karen and Jack - and the struggle that they face to come to terms with it. I guess it is an old story two lovers who cannot love because of who they are. This dates back to Romeo and Juliet. Even though it is old, it is an intelligent plot as there is no clear cut solution. Karen knows her job, but she also knows her feelings for Jack. The bedroom scene is one that adds to the character of Karen as she begins to doubt Jack's sincerity, believing he is only doing it for a dare, but he is not. We know Jack and we know that this is not a simple one night stand for him.Jack is really a noble character. He is a bank robber, but he does not use violence, and in fact he has never fired a gun. He is also a very intelligent and observant character. When he sees the accountant in gaol who has a lot of money sequestered away, he protects him believing that he will benefit afterwards. He doesn't ask for money, but rather relies on his generosity - which turns out to be non-existent when he throws a security uniform at Jack and tells him to work his way up from the bottom.I guess, when I think about it, this is a very good movie as it develops the characters and gives them life. I like intelligent and honourable criminals, namely because I have never met one - I guess it is one of those fictions that don't really exist. The characters have their strengths and flaws and each of them is developed independently. The movie focuses on Jack and Karen, but the others, including Snoop (who is a bad guy in the movie) and Jack's confidant are also well rounded characters. What is interesting is the sister of Jack's confidant. She is a born-again Christian and Jack's Confidant tells her everything. She does turn him in, if the crime has not yet been committed, but he seems to owe her something.

It's between Jack Foley(George Clooney) who is a bank robber that gets what he wants by asking the right way. In another words he is a smooth talker that also has wits and is extremely prideful. But for some reason he is a guy that is still likable and I couldn't help but want him to succeed even if he is a selfish character. Maybe it's because of his easy going attitude and the fact that he has a code and also has class. The female lead is played by Jennifer Lopez and she plays a Karen Sisco who is a Federal Marshal. I will just say she is just right for this role since both the characters chemistry really does stand out. The romance part is a bit short between the two characters but when the chemistry between them picks up, it's sizzling. And how they first bond with each other by making movie references was just plain cool and interesting. Plus this was when George Clooney and Jennifer Lopez was close to their prime. The conversations between the different characters drives this movie. The romance kicks off a bit too quickly but the film explains...Sorta. But than again that actually kinda applies to real life. This film is directed by Steven Soderbergh and he really knows how to put in some classy dialogues. The editing was also really well done, not going in a complete chronological order but it makes the experience and the scenarios more intriguing.

There, Clooney impressed in the way he gave up on his regular character of the cool winking guy, whose actions on screen are all driven by a self sense of coolness and style. It's a fun game to play with him, although not transcendental. In this film, that sense of comedy and funny style will forever be summed up in the scene when the door of an elevator opens and Clooney sees Lopez sitting in a sofa in the lobby of the hotel where she was chasing him, and he becomes numb and simply raises his hand to say hello. That's the thing, that's how his character works.Soderbergh understood that feature of Clooney soon, and here we see him making a first draft to what would be the top of that coolness the ocean's franchise.Here we have a simpler project, a curious one where Soderbergh amuses himself and allows himself some freedom to be personal while creating a money raising project for his more personal projects. It's a normal heist movie, where the enjoyment lies in the complexity of the scheme, how it is planned, and how it unfolds, and all the twists and unpredictabilities within. This is pretty competent in those respects, although you'll get no much out of it.But there is one sequence truly enjoyable in how it announces some interesting later experiences Soderbergh in his personal field. The sequence when Clooney meets Lopez in a hotel. She is being approached by some drooling business men, than Clooney makes his move, they talk, they go to the room, they sleep together. Check the cinematography of that sequence and how it fits uneasily with the rest of the film. That bit suits the work of an author. The urban landscape outside the window of the hotel bar, the colors in the room, the lighting of the faces, even the interest in the dialog. Probably the best bit of acting we got Jennifer Lopez doing ever. I'll keep that scene.My opinion 3/5, it won't harm you, but check the biggest fish Soderbergh has to offer you.http//www.7eyes.wordpress.com "},{"Title":"Why the uncredited rank for Keaton and Jackson?","Date":"25 February 2007","Score":"","Genre":"Crime, Drama, Romance","Review":" This is a very good movie, if you read the book first.

Almost everything about this movie is right and executed well. The pace of the movie allows for the actors to act and bring out their characters beyond plain good and bad guys. They have to, because good and bad can't be too far apart in this movie for the story to work. So they aren't and it does!In fact, almost every scene works, is genuine and original.Clooney and Lopez match and their chemistry is so real, you gladly suspend any disbelieve on how their relationship develops. Any other pair of great actors could easily have blown this. Lopez a great actress? Well in this movie, absolutely, she's up there with George.Finally, I really like the editing. It makes occasional use of mild effects and supports the story and some of the back stories without being overly present. Nice job. There's a crucial scene between Clooney and Lopez where the time-line of the dialogue and the action subtly drift apart and then come back together. "},{"Title":"Do you ever wear one that says 'undercover'?&#133;Out of Sight","Date":"6 August 2006","Score":"","Genre":"Crime, Drama, Romance","Review":" If Out of Sight is any indication, I really need to watch more Steven Soderbergh films. This movie is great on many levels. I've seen and loved Traffic, The Limey is top-notch, and the Ocean's movies are enjoyable at times, however I never really jumped on the bandwagon. Maybe it was the boring, mediocre Erin Brochovich, or the fact that he left his indie roots to kick it with the big boys, I always pushed Soderbergh to the side, saying I'd get to him later. Well later has come. Out of Sight has pitch-perfect performances from every principal and supporting character on screen, the cross between drama, action, and comedy is flawless, and the style has just the right amount of flair.The film starts out by throwing us right into the middle of a heist. Through current happenings and scene specific flashbacks, we learn the back-stories of every character and learn to accept them for whom they are, while also allowing us to believe each one's evolution. George Clooney is great, as usual, playing himself&#151;a smooth talking, slick ladies man, who gets the girl and the spoils. While Clooney could be knocked for not having much range as an actor, he sticks to his strengths and most times succeeds. His turn as a CIA agent in this year's Syriana was well-deserving of the Oscar win, and hopefully he will get credit for the work he has put forth throughout his career; that being solid performances full of natural charisma. Ving Rhames shows us why he is one of the best character actors working today. One of those guys that you don't mind seeing in every film, he doesn't have much to do here, (a part reminiscent to the one he reprises in the Mission Impossible series), he plays it right and never misses a beat. Don Cheadle also shows us the skill that he has finally been recognized for of late. The guy is great as the hero/good guy, (Hotel Rwanda, Manic), and here equal to the task as the villain. Cheadle shows some real malice here&#151; sadistic malice. You never know what he will do next because you actually believe he is capable of anything.Another thing this movie does is remind me how actors like Jennifer Lopez and Steve Zahn can really show skill when they have the right part. Zahn's crazy, naïve, vulnerability is exactly what is needed to play against serious sarcasm, like that thrown around by Clooney's character Foley. Zahn is seen too often in comedies where he falls flat and becomes redundant. He is the laugh man to any straight man, that is his strength and I wish we could see more of him in movies like this. As for Lopez, she really plays the role nicely. She exudes successful woman sexiness, quietly going through the movie, very low-key. This is before she became jack-of-all-trades, watering down her own image. As far as this film and Oliver Stone's U-Turn, she can pull off the gritty drama much better than the saccharine coated movies she churns out presently. Also, one cannot forget to speak of Albert Brook's chameleon-like performance. He is virtually unrecognizable until he speaks in the prison library. Expertly cast in the role, his serious tone lends itself well to the corporate criminal he plays, showing he means business while also letting some of his great comedic timing show through.Through it all there is a great heist story from accomplished author Elmore Leonard. Whether there are plot holes, I really don't remember. The brilliant performances draw you into their world completely and you go along for the ride without thinking twice. Soderbergh is an actor's director for sure. His use of large ensembles always shows off a comradery that is realistic; he allows his cast to have fun and it translates to the screen. He is an artist as well with these quasi-low budget cinematic stabs. Like The Limey, he films with some flair. The still-frame effect is used effectively as a dissolve between scenes. It gets a bit much at some parts where we are shown small hitches, but overall works well for the caper story narrative. When he cuts between Lopez and Clooney at the hotel bar and room, we are given an amazing visceral scene. This is the crowning achievement of the film. With the bar conversation voicing over the scene, we go back and forth between the sexual tension at the bar and the awkwardness of their almost school yard crush at bedside. It is a great sequence to be remembered for its delicate care.I hope to eventually see Soderbergh's recent film Bubble and its subsequent digital companions in the future. It will be interesting to see him direct amateurs and if his skills are as good as they seem when handling the egos of professionals. Sex, Lies, and Videotapes along with Schizopolis are entering the queue of movies to see, and hopefully his Ocean's 13, filming soon, won't ruin a good thing, especially since 12 came dangerously close to doing so already.

George Clooney and several other bank robbers break out of prison and kidnap FBI agent Lopez who is assigned to catch them. She and Clooney soon fall in love, but the rest of the film doesnt make much sense. The last half of the film, Clooney and his gang of thugs (with no Lopez) are planning to break into a millionaire's mansion (who was one of their former cellmates) and steal his large collection of diamonds. The scene where they break into the house at the end is the only real scene of action in the whole film, so if you are renting this to watch an action movie, then you have the wrong rental.

Jack breaks out of prison thanks to a few buddies, but Karen happens to be in the prison parking lot during the attempt.  She tries to apprehend the escapees, but she ends up in her own trunk with Jack since they decide, at the last minute, to use her car as their ticket to freedom.  The sparks fly, and once they part ways,  the two try to figure out if a romance could actually be possible between them.  The chemistry between Karen and Jack was completely believable thanks to great acting by Lopez and Clooney.  Normally, George's acting doesn't impress me.  Even when he donned the Batman suit in Batman and Friends or whatever it was called, I still thought, 'Oh, there's Doug Ross (Clooney's ER character) as Batman'.  But, he was actually great in this role, looking very dapper, might I add, in a few scenes.  Lopez was equally successful in her role.  The supporting actors are top notch.  I watched this movie with my mom, and many parts had her laughing, so I think she enjoyed this movie too.  Director Steven Soderbergh has a unique vision.   This is the first film of his that I've seen, but this one makes me want to see more.  As an example, at the times when it seemed most appropriate, he froze the frame for a few fleeting moments so that you could savor the complexity of the moment.  That was very effective.  The story is also told in an original flashback manner, which makes for a fresh film experience.  Watch for the scene when Karen and Jack are talking in the coctail lounge and the snow is falling in the background.  Great filmmaking!

The movie is so laid back and cool, even in the shootout sequences, that you feel like you've just gotten out of an Asian massage parlor after watching it. George Clooney proves that he is the only NBC TV actor (from the Must See TV Days) who can move to the big screen and become even better. The guy smacks of movie star. Jennifer Lopez is downright sizzling in this flick. She hasn't been in a movie since that has done her beauty justice. And the chemistry between her and Clooney almost melts away the celluloid. Dennis Farina is awesome as always, Ving Rhames proves he's an actor of all seasons, Don Cheadle puts just the right mixture of comedy and menace into his role, and Steve Zahn is highly overlooked as an actor. He was the best thing about That Thing You Do and almost steals the show here. Plus, putting in Micheal Keaton as the same character he played in Jackie Brown is a stroke of genius. And the pace that Steven Soderburgh keeps the film at is masterful. After all is said and done, he'll be looked at as one of the great filmmakers in history.

Jack Foley (George Clooney) is a career bank robber who recently escaped from prison, Karen Sisco (Jennifer Lopez) is the Federal Marshall that Jack took hostage for a brief time in order to escape - and who's now trying to bring Jack back to jail.  Besides the obvious cat-and-mouse game of hunting down the illustrious Mr. Foley, there's a certain romantic connection going on between Jack and Karen that complicates things, as well as a plan to rob a Michael Milken-esque criminal of over one million dollars' worth of diamonds.The dialogue is vintage Elmore Leonard - lots of dry humor, lots of wisecracks, and perfect comic timing.  The chemistry between Clooney and Lopez is great; you actually find yourself caring a lot about what happens and will happen between the two.  The situation they're put in is slightly implausible (Federal Marshall falling in love with a career criminal . . . not exactly realistic); I don't know if the movie could've survived without the deft romantic tension between the two.  Also of note in the film is Don Cheadle as Maurice `Snoopy' Miller, the cold-blooded criminal who thinks he's a lot smarter than he really is.  `Snoopy' moves effortlessly between being laughably stupid and heartlessly cold-blooded, sometimes within the same scene.  His performance alone makes the movie worth watching.Soderbergh's direction is very good, if a little uneven - I think he was still finding his voice with this film and with `The Limey'.  A lot of the quick cuts between scenes are meant to be edgy, but wind up just being irritating.  Still, the story moves at a crisp pace, and some of the scenes (such as a meeting between Jack Foley and `Snoopy' Miller at a boxing gym) are brilliant.A highly entertaining film - I'm amazed this didn't do better at the box office when it was originally released.

Soderberg's work here is equal to that of both 'Traffic' and 'Brockovich' and his unique story telling techniques sets him out above the rest. What is obvious in this film is his superb ability to tell a story through the film medium. Leaving the excellent acting aside, the films construction itself is one of high standard and class. Editing techniques courtesy of Soderberg veteran 'Coates A.C.E.' fit neatly with the score which in itself is rounded and sleek. The on screen chemistry between Clooney and Lopez has been noted well enough but it is the ability of the entire assemble that helps carry the film. The mix of thriller, romance and comedy works to Soderberg's advantage. Not only is this movie in-captivating but its dry black humour and cool, classy love scenes only add to highten the tension of the overall film. Credit should be given to Lopez for her sassy 'Sisco' and Clooney should not go with out notice for one of the best acting pieces of his post 'ER' career. Rhames pulls of the loyal, hard ass act with seeming ease and Cheadle only goes to improve on his past performances. The credit of this fantastic film must really go to Soderberg though because we see his style here which set the precedent for both 'Brockovich' and 'Traffic' as well as, to a certain extent the somewhat forgotten 'Limey' What is clear is that this is really the start of Soderberg's 'A-Lister' career and should be noted in history as the film that started it off. There is no doubt that he will go on to bigger works and we have certainly not seen the last of him. If the films that followed this are anything to go by then Hollywood directors everywhere should be aware. This film shows of the skills of a man who has the power to out shine Spielberg in the next century.

A bank robber breaks out of prison, abducts a female US Marshal, and...chats with her about Faye Dunaway movies before releasing her unharmed!? Later, after she tracks him to Detroit, they have a few drinks, sharing some of the best dialogue in years, then...!? When he said, Why would you think that?  Why would you think I would think that? I heard myself saying out loud, Wow, that's good writing. After this and Three Kings, I want to see anything that George Clooney does from now on.  He's proven himself, as far as I'm concerned, one of the best actors working today, and he's finally getting scripts worthy of him. Jennifer Lopez and the rest of the cast were uniformally excellent.  (And it was nice to see Nancy Allen again, even if for a few moments.  Where's she been?)  All the characters were well-written and well-played. This is one of the few cases where the screenplay was better than the already-good book. Crime movies, full of shooting and other violence, cruelty and profanity, are so commonplace that I've become jaded and almost desensitized to them. But occasionally, something like this comes along that concentrates on character instead of plot, and makes up for all the heartless, mindless, garbage they keep endlessly remaking and recycling. That this gem of a film died at the box office the same summer that the stupid, inept, intelligence-insulting Armageddon became the biggest hit of the year says more about the quality of moviegoers than of movies. If you haven't seen Out of Sight, and you don't mind profanity and violence (when they're used well and in context), then see this film immediately. And the ending still has me laughing.

I mean, come on, it's just a modest little caper movie for crying out loud, let's not get carried away. The main problem I had with it was the central relationship between Clooney and Lopez; I don't know, I just didn't buy it, they didn't convince me that they were so all-consumingly attracted to each other that they would jeopardize themselves the way they did. I think the initial conversation they had in the car would have needed to be A LOT better for me to go along with it all (although I couldn't say exactly how).Of course, since I didn't buy the central relationship, the fact that I still liked the film is a testament to how well everything else in the movie works. The cast is uniformly great - from Ving Rhames as Clooney's guilt-plagued assistant to Steve Zahn's memorable stoner of a crook. The look of the film is superb, and the chopped up editing works exceptionally well. Of course, it's easy to get the sense, while watching, that a great deal of craft and style has been expended to cover up what is essentially a mediocre story. So be it. It still works, if just barely, and is good for an evening of light entertainment. But as far as Elmore Leonard movies go, it doesn't hold a candle to Get Shorty.

I hate to tell you people out there, but most of these awards are extremely political in nature. For example  why did Jim Carrey receive the Golden Globe for best actor? Now anyone that saw The Truman Show knows that he improved a great deal, but also that he wasn't exceptional. Both Tom Hanks and Ian McKellen gave better performances, but both are already established. And now that Carrey has his award, the more important one (the Oscar) can go to Hanks or McKellen, and everyone will be happy. (Note that I am not mentioning Nick Nolte in Affliction because I have not seen it yet.) Now back to Out of Sight. The critics like to spread the wealth so to speak, and Hanks and Spielberg already have had their share. Most people believe that those two will get their share of Oscars again this year, and that Truman will get the screenplay award. So, how best to catch the public's attention? Raise a little known (and very well- done, original) film like Out of Sight above them for the time being. Often a nice surprise is better than an expected gift. And so everyone is talking about it, and the critics have won again. Never fear though, film lovers.

Almost all of the characters could be on both sides of the fence, and with OUT OF SIGHT, you're never entirely sure how the lead characters, bank robber Jack Foley (George Clooney) and FBI Marshall Karen SiSko (that's Sisco with 2 s's, Jack) played by the gorgeous and engaging Jennifer Lopez, will end up.Thankfully, the script does not take the usual Hollywood path of deciding against a character's realistic intentions. They do not exactly ride off into the sunset together.

This doesn't happen in this film. For example in the beginning of the film, Jack Foley (Clooney's character)tried to be a smart-wise and rob a bank without any guns, knives or any preparation, he just use his head and his charisma. You may find it pretty smart but you wouldn't believe he can just get away like that don't you? Well, 'Out of sight' regards us as intelligent enough so Jack gets caught. I started to like the movie and like it even more when Karen Sisco ( Lopez) comes on screen. The relationship between Sisco and Foley is very sexy although there's not much physical contact between them. The pace of the film, the music, the freeze-shots, all of them make this film to be very stylish. The screenplay is both funny and intelligent. I think the whole thing's been done thoughtfully.

An excellent character study, though, that gives us half a dozen well-developed characters. Clooney and Lopez are excellent in the leads, although it is difficult to buy Lopez's on the job fashion statements (I guess all U.S. Marshals dress like that). Don Cheadle, as a violent hood, and Steve Zahn, as a stoner car thief, provide the most enjoyable performances.

The dialogue was smart and funny, and the events unpredictable and interesting. Some key cameos reminded the viewer of Tarantino's movies and that yes, Tarantino's style CAN be imitated and still be good and original. Besides the cameos and the out of sequence scenes, the ultra violence and sex was more controlled than Tarantino usually provides. The sex scene between Clooney and Lopez was most impressive in that it was sexual without showing the sex (sorry guys, Lopez does NOT get naked). Clooney is still the coolest newcomer to the movies, and it appears he has now made an effort to ACT as well.

A prison break brings together a successful but ultimately doomed bank robber with a federal marshal who lets nothing stand in the way of her job.Jack Foley has spent half of his life behind bars and this escape for freedom is the one that's going to count. He can be that crook who does one last job and goes on to lead the good life. That is, until, Karen Sisco, armed with a shotgun and badge, walks into his world.She is quickly disarmed and a hostage situation in the boot of a getaway car soon becomes a unique first date with the nervous chatter and charm of two people whose body language says this is the moment they've been waiting for.The role of Jack Foley allowed Clooney to deliver a performance of style and substance and prove he's a feature film actor. His cool flick of a zippo lighter symbolises a man who lives life on the edge, clearly struggling with the fact that the chance of that one big score is decreasing with age.Jennifer Lopez promised so much in this role as a woman whose dedication to the job has left her stuck in the dating game with hothead cops and FBI agents. She's a survivor in a man's world but when she finally finds that spark, her code of honour plays second fiddle to her search for real love.This performance was pre J-Lo and suggests that if the 37-year-old actress could have been prevented from chasing the mission of urban cool, she may have delivered other well-rounded performances and developed into a leading actress for the higher echelon of dramatic cinema.The characters' desire for one another and their respective professions make the pursuit for justice a thrilling and sexy series of brief interludes in a range of seasonal locations across America.Soderbergh excels in his direction, especially the 'Time Out' scene where he bends time and space to splice talky seduction and silent disrobing episodes together into something much more intimate than any mere sex scene.The style of Elmore Leonard is evident in the script as it flashes back to Foley's time in prison he becomes involved in a diamond heist on a dirty banker's home, which leads to the inevitable double cross by Don Cheadle's violent gangster, Snoop.The friendship of trust between Clooney and his accomplice Buddy, played by Ving Rhames, works on the understanding that through bad luck or conflicts of conscience they have wasted the best part of their lives in prison and this one last heist presents an opportunity, despite their cynicism, to get their hard earned ticket to happiness.A story of circumstance that asks if things were different, if we had followed a different path, how would things be? Foley can't face another prison stretch but can't change who he is and in a moment with Karen, he declares what meeting her has done to him It's like seeing someone for the first time, and you look at each other for a few seconds, and there's this kind of recognition like you both know something. Next moment the person's gone, and it's too late to do anything about it. The chance encounters and romantic rendezvous come to an end when Foley's conscience betrays him and by going back to the scene of the diamond heist, he saves a woman from Snoop's gang, but puts himself in Karen's gun sight. What if she wasn't a federal marshal? What if he wasn't a bank robber? What if?

Soderbergh quickly went on to cement his reputation with a string of commercial and artistic hits Erin Brockovich (2000), Traffic (2000), and Ocean's Eleven (2001).This is the sort of movie that Howard Hawks or Michael Curtiz might have directed if they'd been born 50 years later.

Jack and Karen hit it off big time, despite being on opposite sides of the law, but a bungled robbery at a rich man's house in Detroit pits them against each other. Will love overcome business differences ? A well-made, sassy, punchy crime-thriller based on one of Elmore Leonard's great pulp crime novels, this movie is a bit schizophrenic. Half of it is hard-as-nails bad-boy action, with Clooney as a latter-day Cagney, busting heads and trading quips. The other half is a smoochy romantic pot-boiler with him in his more familiar Cary Grant persona. It's good, but he's a bit sappy at times (unlike, say, Chili Palmer in Get Shorty, which was made by the same writer and producers), which dissipates the tension and pads it out a bit much for my liking. Lopez is good too, cool and remote, with too much attitude and lipstick, but she's not quite in the Lana Turner / Barbara Stanwyck league. Scott Frank's screenplay is full of quotable dialogue and the film does not want for style; there is particularly brilliant editing by Anne V. Coates, with plenty of aptly-placed fades and jump-stills. I'm not quite sure why I didn't like this movie more - it's got plenty of pedigree and all the performances are good, particularly Cheadle as the scary but dumb-as-a-box-of-rocks gangster. I think it's really just because I didn't know who to identify with; Jack and Karen are pretty slick but they're a bit too perfect and untouchable at the same time. Well worth a viewing though. Both Keaton and Jackson appear unbilled, with the former reprising his unlikeable character from Jackie Brown. Later developed by the producers into a good TV show called Karen Sisco.

Both cons capture her and hide her in the trunk of the car with Jack inside. There Karen and Jack have an interesting conversation which leaves both with a strong attraction towards each other. Hence the dilemma of the film, Karen is a cop she's supposed to return him to prison, but the new found appeal she has for him leaves her confused. Jack is in the same predicament he likes Karen and wants to get to know her more, but how can he if she's a cop? The film sets off on a cat and mouse game where Karen desperately searches for Jack and her doubts of what to do when she finally finds him. Between the chases we're introduced to a vast array of colorful characters. Among these characters is the notable psychopath Snoopy (played by Don Cheadle) he's quite deadly you wouldn't want to mess with him, and the blabbermouth stoner Glenn Michaels (played by Steve Zahn) who offers comic relief to the story as we watch his foolish antics.I thought the film was going to be all action and shootings, but it actually turned out to be more of a character study packed with a witty and enticing script. I never thought it would be this much fun to watch people having conversations. The best part of the film though was the magnetic chemistry and performances by the two leads Jennifer Lopez and George Clooney. You can't help but smile at their charming and smooth dialogue.

George Clooney is one of my favorite actors, so needless to say, with him and Jennifer Lopez in the same movie, I was in for a good time. And I was not disappointed. While the movie did slow down a little half way through, the rest of it was a lot of fun to watch. Clooney stars as Jack Foley, a bank robber who has the distinction of robbing the most banks probably in history, without ever using a gun. His style is shown within the first two minutes of the movie, as he spots a bank from across the street, and just decides to go ahead and rob it. He would have gotten away with it had his car started. So he's off to prison, where he realizes he can't stay because he doesn't want to get old. He enlists his friend Buddy (Ving Rhames) to help him break out. But the escape is almost foiled when lovely Federal Officer Karen Sisco (Lopez) happens upon them. Buddy and Jack decide to take her with them, and Jack and Karen are thrown into the trunk of her car for the getaway. Well, they sort of fall for each other, a la `love at first sight,' while in the trunk, and the rest of the movie involves whether or not they can, or should, get together.  Oh yea, they also plan to do a home invasion of a man with millions of dollars of uncut diamonds. With a cast that includs Albert Brooks, Don Cheadle, Dennis Farina, and Steve Zahn, Out of Sight is a well acted, well written story. The movie doesn't go from point A to point B. Sort of like Pulp Fiction it starts at point A, goes back in time to show how we got to point A, veers off to follow another story, comes back to the main story, and continuously jumps back and forth to see what happened in the past, and what happened in previous scenes we never saw finish. But it's not as confusing as what I just wrote. It all makes perfect sense, and it's very interesting. Now, some people are going to say, how is it possible that a Federal Officer and a three time convicted bank robber would possible get together? Have you seen these two people? Besides, their characters are both hard driven people, and I don't really care how unlikely it is, the path they take to try and get together is fun to watch. Clooney's character is very smart; he just decides to use his brains to steal. But he has a heart as well. Lopez's character is also very smart, and all she wants to do is prove that she can make it in what is generally considered a man's job. This is really a different kind of movie. More low-key, better acted, no big explosions, and one very funny death scene on a stairwell. Definitely one to see.

The acting and direction were pretty good but the story and writing drags the film to a average level.  George Clooney is charismatic as the thief, Jack Foley and Jennifer Lopez is absolutely stunning as Karen Sisco.  The scenes with the two together are very good and help make this film watchable.  The best scene is the sequence in the hotel.Ving Rhames is good as usual.  Out of Sight(1998) seems to follow the lead of other adaptations of Leonard novels such as Jackie Brown(1997) and Get Shorty(1995) with the emphasis on black humor.  This is a drastic contradiction from the seriousness of Mr. Majesktik(1975), 52 Pick Up(1986), and Cat Chaser(1988).  Michael Keaton plays the same character that he played in Jackie Brown(1997) in a cameo role as Karen's boyfriend.

He plans to burgle a wealthy fellow inmate, now on the outside, who holds over five million dollars worth of uncut diamonds in his house.  However, he falls in love with the female hostage, who just happens to be an FBI agent.There's plenty of scope there for a brilliant film, and I'm sure Elmore Leonard's book is a great base.  But there seems to have been a breakdown in the transition from book to film.  The film is desperately slow, moving at a snail's pace.  This film could easily have been cut down from 123 minutes to 90-odd, without any significant sacrifices.  I was longing for it to end after about the first hour.The main characters lacked chemistry - I found the 'love' scenes cringeworthy and forced.  Also, having spent so long concentrating on character development, I found some of George Clooney's motivations baffling.  Why was he so dead against going back to jail?  He didn't seem to have too bad a time of it, we never see him getting picked on or beaten up, in fact he stands up to some of the hardest guys in the jail without so much as a flinch.The film does tend to flash backwards and forwards in time, and this is clumsily executed, especially when tied in with a dream sequence.  I was totally confused as to what was going on for a good ten minutes at one point, and I suspect this was due to poor direction and editing, also evidenced in the excessive length of the film.That's not to say that this film doesn't have points to recommend it - the cinematography was very good, as was much of the acting.

Foley and the woman are forced into the trunk of her car and he finds out that she's Karen Sisco (Jennifer Lopez), a beautiful federal agent.  The conversation that they have is quite interesting and it's very different from the one that Al Pacino and Robert De Niro have in Heat.   The supporting cast in this movie is terrific.  Clooney, Lopez, and Rhames give nice performances.  But I enjoyed Steve Zahn, who is wonderful as the ill-minded Glenn Michaels and Don Cheadle is superb as the mean ex-boxer Maurice Miller.  Dennis Farina, Albert Brooks, and Catherine Keener are included in the solid cast.  Michael Keaton and Samuel L. Jackson are unbilled.

Basically career bank robber Jack Foley (Clooney) is caught and imprisoned, and we see some of his time in jail through some flashback style sequences talking to inmates about escape. Then he gets the opportunity to escape, and he manages it with the help of his accomplice Buddy Bragg (Pulp Fiction's Ving Rhames), but not without U.S. Marshal Karen Sisco (Jennifer Lopez) trying to stop them. She is put in the trunk of the car next to Jack, and they get to know each other reasonably well before they part ways, with the crooks planning to hit rich businessman Richard Ripley (Finding Nemo's Albert Brooks). While Karen is trying to catch up to Jack, for more than just crimes, criminal Maurice 'Snoopy' Miller (Don Cheadle) has also managed to get out of prison, and he also plans to hit on the Ripley mansion. There is a point when Karen is hanging out in the bar of the hotel she knows Jack is staying, and she is being chatted up by some other losers, before he comes along to offer a drink, which she accepts and they sleep together. Although they part ways, she knows the plan Jack has devised, and she goes to end the investigation and crimes herself, but of course her feelings for Jack will hold her back.

Jennifer Lopez shows great charisma and dominance in her role as an FBI agent, who's committed to her job yet falls for Foley's (the criminal she's in hot pursuit of) charm.  This is one of her best roles up to date.  Ving Rhames is terrific as usual, as Foley's right hand man Buddy.  Of course, he plays his usual buffed-up bodyguard role, but I feel this one has more depth than his similar roles in Striptease and Entrapment.  Don Cheadle, who I still feel is one of our best underrated actors, is great as an ex-con seeking to rip-off a snobby Wall Street broker (Albert Brooks).  Steve Zahn again shows his comic talent at playing the slow-witted accomplice.  Also look for Michael Keaton in a reprise of his role as Ray Nicolette from Tarantino's Jackie Brown.  He has a hilarious scene where he interacts with Lopez's father (Dennis Farina, who gives another great, professional performance).  Finally, await a surprise cameo at the very end of the film.  I REALLY hope that fellow IMDB users have not mentioned the cameo (That's very rude).  I'm sure you will be amazed and amused to find out who the mystery man is.  The dialogue is great and the characters exchange their words in a very down to earth manner.  This is the kind of film you watch and think to yourself, This is REALLY how people talk!  Much like Soderbergh's debut sleeper sex, lies and videotape.  Soderbergh's direction is vivid and lively, and is best demonstrated in the witty interaction between Clooney and Lopez in the bar, in which he intercuts between them staring into each other's eyes and them in the hotel slowly undressing, while their voice-overs narrate their thoughts.  I loved the music, including great soul hits like It's Your Thing.  The flaws?  The film's episodic fashion gets meandering at points, and causes you to slightly lose interest.  In other words, it could've moved at a faster pace.  And maybe a few more minutes in the editing room. Out of Sight is identical to a Tarantino crime caper  vivid characterizations, vivid dialogue including moments of kooky small talk and hysterical comedy, use of great soul classics, etc.  Everything except the nonstop profanity.  Not to say that the language in this film is sanitized, but considering the standard R-rated flick, no one should be strongly offended.This is a smart, witty, funny, often engaging crime caper that is definitely worth a look.  And yes, the movie does prove to be OUT OF SIGHT!!!My score  7 (out of 10)   "},{"Title":"Disappointing","Date":"11 June 2000","Score":"2 out of 4 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Crime, Drama, Romance","Review":"  I was so excited about this film, but after 2 hours, all that excitement didn't linger to the end because this film is disappointing.

He brought it into living color. The style and sharp spoken dialog, with his partner in crime, made this one a fun and especially tasty performance. Displaying that typical Clooney-charm that has made him a house hold name, and for good reason. George lacked nothing in my view. Along with Michael Keaton, Ving Rhames too, let us not forget, but most of all a lovely performance that made the romantic opposite grade, with Jennifer Lopez. When she was still wit diddy, Puffy. However the distraction of the front page of the Natiional Inquirer, this film, was a pace setting action dramedy, with enough clout to offer to making a sequel. Although sometimes, many times, it's good to just let a classic stand on it's own.My brother in law at the time tried to play 'movie-critic', with me about this one, saying it lacked a lot. He was an idiot anyhow. All who were involved, including the always awesome Dennis Farina, made this one stand out with other epic pictures, that will remain standing well into the future, when other movies have gone by the wayside.I really had a satisfying time with this one.

This though isn't nowhere near as good as Jackie Brown, the characters aren't as well crafted, it doesn't have the depth, and the plot in general is not as good or well told.

As it should, must and has to be. Unknown is of course and as usual, if her father is her real father, thinking of the question by a Shakespeare play, an actor saying who knows his father? We neither see or hear something of her mother, but her daughter is proof enough that there has been a pregnant woman, her mother. The relation father-daughter is as good as it can and should be. She is not only his little girl but also my tough babe!. Out of sight is a romantic crime-thrilling comedy, the frame of seeing individuals behind the recognizing stereotypes. Inside of this mirroring crime frame the mirror of the lady Marshall and the bank robber, the mirror of Karen and Jack, mirroring Garys and Celestes timeout. It is Karens luck but U.S. Marshall Karen Siscos bad luck, that she comes to the right place, but untimely too early, being involved against her will in the jail break, being suddenly Jack Foleys hostage, a career bank robber who prides himself on never having robbed a single bank with a gun. Leaving their own getaway car behind, Jacks partner-in-crime Buddy hides both in the trunk of her car. On their way to meet another partner-in-crime, Sisco and Foley talk, Karen and Jack stumbling into a love-trap. After her escape from Jack, she is his hostage &#150; and he hers, love chained to each other as the hunted hunter, hunting the hunter. From now on they seek each other. This is of course a conflict for the U.S. Marshall and the career bank robber! Out of Sights turning core are the six minutes of timeout as Gary and Celeste. While they talk we see as background, switching back and forth, their meeting as lovers. The six-minutes-scene is the frame in the frame, mirroring what they do as U.S. Marshall and bank robber, what they are as Karen and Jack and what they are during the moment of 'kairos', the right moment. Around these six minutes turns everything around as a merry-go-round. But life has to go on. After the diamonds are found in Ripleys house, Jack and Buddy leave. But why returns Jack, hollywoodsensing that Karen, the U. S Marshall Sisco is around? Karen as executing U.S. Marshal Sisco, chains Jack, the career bank robber at the stairs landing, facing the entering SWAT-team. Karen answers quickly the complaining Jack,I am sorry, I wish it would have been different. Karen Sisco, the U.S. Marshall, represents the executing part of Law, never forgot her duty, inside this frame as Karen Sisco, pleasured as Celeste the timeout. What she did as Karen and Celeste never was corruptious. And phone talking to her father, He knew what he was doing. Nobody &#133;. (in one of the back-flashes and freezed frames Ripley offers him the lousy payed Job of a security guard, which Jack angry turns down, Ripley answering You can only rob banks enrages him that he minutes after robs a branch of the SunTrust bank (the films introduction), gets caught, comes to Glades, is part of the jail break, host-aging Karen the story has started 'out of sight' before it started.) &#133; forced him to rob banks. She should have escorted the night before another prisoner to Glades but waits for Jack Foley. Giving him his lighter, she says that she must have it back before arriving at Glades. Much can happen between Detroit and Glades as, Foley says to the prisoner that it is a long ride to Florida. It is our own fantasy, deciding what happens beyond Out of Sight. In her phone talk with her father he seems to like her out-of-sight-romance much better, promising a more exiting future than with her silly, boring boyfriend Ray. Having in mind Maid in Manhattan, Enough and The Cell the red thread is J L. Cinderellas story changes into a abusing nightmare, needing Enough and The Cell to sort out things. The Cells Catherine, believing in the strength of the 'reversed feed' invites against her teams will the coma-patient Carl Rudolphe Staghner to her Unconscience, telling that in her world her rules has to be accepted (in Enough Slim hears from her abusing husband I make the money, so I make the rules.). The Out of Sight-kairos-situation with Celest and Gary goes further is &#150; different. Like Karens say, looking at the picture in the newspaper of Jack Foley, He looks like &#150; different. The Celeste-Gary-timeout looks like &#150; different. Both worlds rules are focused on. Such happens only once in a lifetime. We are born by a two-forces-conception, to be born as a person &#150; and as a personality, looking for the kairos-moment. U.S. Marshall Karen Sisco and the bank robber Jack Foley have as Karen and Jack met as Gary and Celeste in this 'silly' movie Out of Sight. Silly? Sometimes truth has to be disguised by silliness.

The first DVD I purchased was Steven Soderburg's Out of Sight. It had the indie cred I desired, plus it was by a director I admired. And I am the type of person to admire directors over actors, genres, and type. Plus it didn't do well at the box office so I could feel justified in my ability to overlook the big blockbusters and snuggle into something small and arty. I have since realized that trying to impress some film buff that will never show himself at my house is both immature and not very practical. After a few additional classics (2001, Taxi Driver, and Evil Dead II) I came to realize that there are some extremely popular DVDs that are must haves. It's hard to claim indy cred when you're picking up Jaws and Animal House. Plus my DVD player came with free copies of crap like Michael and Basic Instinct. Add that to the odd assortment of movies I keep picking up as gifts and swiping from my brother via Mom and you have a whole heap of DVDs not worth bragging about.All of this is simply to say I like Out of Sight a great deal. I have watched it every six months or so since I bought it 5 years ago and have never been disappointed. It is a crime story more interested in characters than crime. Though some of the plot points are on the implausible side, the film is so overwhelmingly enjoyable it is easy to forgive such faults.Soderburg is a talented artist, though as a director he is a bit of a mixed bag. He has created some truly brilliant films (Traffic, the Limey) but also a few bombs, artistically speaking (Full Frontal, Oceans 11). After starting the indie revolution with Sex, Lies, and Videotape he created the first of several experimental films, Kafka. Thus developing a theme for his films smart, original films followed by artistic experiments that mostly fail. With Out of Sight he began what I would call his attempt at being main stream. It is based on a Elmore Leonard novel, produced by Danny DeVito and Barry Sonnefeld, and stars a couple of up and commers looking for a hit. For those of you that scoffed at my labeling this movie indie do understand that this movie was pre Erin Brokovich, Traffic, or the Oceans series for Soderburg. George Clooney was a television star from ER, but had yet to have a successful movie. And Jennifer Lopez was still Jennifer Lopez rather than J.Lo, Jenny from the Block, or Bennifer. In 1992 it was, well, not exactly an indie movie, but it definitely was not a sure fired block buster. Point of fact, it rather bombed at the box office.Soderburg tends to be his own director of photography on his pictures. By his own admission, this is more because of his method of producing pictures quickly, than at his own expertise at this skill. Though he does do a good job at it. In fact, one of the first things I noticed about the picture, was its use of light. There are two prisons seen in the picture, and both are given a different enough look that you can easily tell them apart. During the scenes in Miami, the lighting is very bright and sunny. Soderburg intentionally over lighted the windows for interior shots to give the outside a particularly sunny look. Detroit is shot in a lot of blues that give an added feel of cold and separation.Each character is given a chance to shine. There are no flat characters designed to move the plot along. Rather they are fleshed out and appear real. Clooney and Lopez show real chemistry on screen and you begin to believe that a US Marshall could actually fall for an escaped bank robber. I have never seen an episode of ER and my buddies and I used to make fun of Clooney for his charming good looks and general star quality. This is the film that began to change my mind and understand him for the fine actor he has become. This film also made me believe that Jennifer Lopez was a fine actress and someone to look out for. But, of course, she quickly became a caricature of herself and has not done anything since then to make me a believer.I love this film. It is a crime drama that pays more attention to character than crime. It is romantic, without being schmaltzy. It is funny, without shooting for gags. It is a well made, competent movie that holds up on repeated viewings. I can still brag that it holds a place on my DVD shelf.

Prior to willingly relinquishing her life to celebrity press becoming in the process the biggest media whore planet Earth has seen since Elizabeth Taylor's heyday, Lopez was simply an actress. And a damn good one, too - as this film aptly demonstrates!In what turned out to be one of her last worthy movies before crap like The Wedding Planner, Maid in Manhattan and Gigli took the center stage, she simply illuminates the screen.Also starring is George Clooney as jaunty serial bank robber and jail inmate Nick Foley. As the frames start to roll, he's for the umpteenth time shipped off to yet another correctional facility - this time in Florida, after an unsuccessful robbery of a Miami bank when his getaway car wouldn't start. Soon enough though, he manages to bust out (on Super Bowl Sunday no less), piggybacking on the escape plan of a few Cubans. Waiting for him, parked outside of the prison gates, is his trusty friend and partner Buddy (Ving Rhames). By pure chance, also hanging around is FBI marshall Karen Sisco (Lopez) - there to pick up an inmate who needs to be transferred. All of a sudden she's unexpectedly witnessing a prison break and quickly moves to alert the guards. In the ensuing chaos she is grabbed by Foley, shoved into the trunk of a car and is now fleeing the scene with a jail escapee and his driver-accomplice. And so the fun begins.......What follows is greatly developed pulpy story with a series of stylish vignettes involving excellent supporting characters like the brutal Snoopy Miller (Don Cheadle), spaced-out Glen (Steve Zahn), talkative millionaire crook Richard Ripley (Albert Brooks), Foley's ex-wife Adele (Catherine Keener), jail escapee Chino (Luis Guzmán), Karen's dad (Denis Farrina), etc.The look and the atmosphere of this thing are indescribably appealing.

I bought the hype, but at least waited until it came onto VHS before I saw it. What A let down.  I must set the record straight here and now; there is no chemistry onscreen between J Lo and Georgy. None that I could see anyway. Ms Lopez goes through this flick with basically the same, or similar, expression.  Just like Madonna, as a dancer she's a woeful actress. She doesn't have the gravitas or screen presence to portray an FBI officer who falls for a criminal so much, that she's prepared to put her career on the line. Well, maybe she would, if they looked and dressed like fashion models. SPOILER!!! BEWARE!!!In one early scene, she's so easily disarmed of her weapon, it's laughable.  And she never seems to portray the vulnerability of a woman who really fancies a dangerous type of guy. As for Georgy, he just does his bad-criminal-with-a-heart-of-gold-who-never-hurts-anyone routine, which we've seen in From Dusk To Dawn. Come on Georgy. Take a risk, and play a totally awful dislikable character.  Stretch yourself man!!It's main flaw is the stars in love gig, which works in a film like The Getaway, because Steve Mcqueen and Ali Macgraw WERE in love.P.S. I've heard that Georgy couldn't stand J Lo, because of her diva ego trippin' ways.

The story is about a charismatic and gentleman gangster (Clooney) who falls in love with a female cop (Lopez). The story is pretty easy and of course brings a lot of possibilities for intersting conflicts between both characters. What the movie makes so great is the style of the movie, defenetely Soderbergh´s best movie, in the movie are similar elements like in Traffic( cinematography) or Erin Brockovich ( editing) involved but this movie is much more interesting and entertaining then anything else Soderbergh did. He probably can thank his two leading actors for that. The chemistry between both is SO hot that you really think the screen is burning, and the movie is not imaginable with other performers. The way Soderberg tells the story is intersting too, he uses several flash backs and dream sequenzes, sometimes a bit confusing bit defenetely interesting. The cinematography, editing and soundtrack is very good too and make this movie a fest for all senses, never before a director combined thriller, romance and comedy on such a succsesful and greay way like Soderbergh did with this movie, so thumbs up. I must say it is still very underrated, I mean everybody praises the director for the movies he did later, but not one of them reachs the brilliantness, smartness and coolness of this one, defenetely the diamond in his filmography, as well as in the filmography of the actors, it would be so great if Jennifer Lopez would rather stick to those movies, then to the crap she lately did because here you can see her great potential. 10/10 "},{"Title":"Smooth, sexy, and oh-so cool","Date":"13 February 2003","Score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Crime, Drama, Romance","Review":"  People look at me funny when I say that this is one of my all-time favorite films...

It's simply a pleasure to watch from start to finish - I wouldn't change anything about it. This really is accomplished and intelligent film making. Soderbergh transformed Clooney in this film, from an uncertain wobbly-headed B-list lead into a genuine movie star. Of course, Lopez hasn't even approached these heights since and Soderbergh hasn't bettered it.I can understand that some people might find the direction and editing a bit too tricksy and it doesn't really have an emotional punch. But that's hardly the point. Leonard's world is full of ultra-cool criminals, with all the lines and bags of charm.

Good director, good writing, good actors, great sound track, but by far, my favorite aspect of the movie is the editing.  This is one of the most well edited movies I have seen in some time.  There are lots of great Godard-style jump cuts, melding together of scenes that take place hours later, cutting back and forth between 10 years...it's great, and it all works, wonderfully.  You can tell in alot of this movie (especially the trunk scene) that Soderbergh just shot the scenes like a hundred times from different angles and then just handed it to the editor to figure out.  I don't know how long it took to edit this movie but i'm willing to bet it took a while.The acting in this movie is pretty good too.  George Clooney did a great job, and was one of the few characters that stayed true to the novel's characters (for instance, Ving Rhames's character was a white guy, and Jenifer Lopez's character was a blond white girl).

This was the movie that announced Clooney as a film star and Lopez showed that she's easily a better actress than singer, though you wouldn't know it these days.A great script coupled with a cracking Elmore Leonard story and a soundtrack that suits the mood of the film perfectly. And of course, direction that serves to tell the story in the best way possible (the shifting timescale wasn't written in  originally but was conceived by Soderburgh and screenwriter Scott Frank, after they felt the straightforward adaption didn't do the book justice). When you watch it again, then you'll realise the little flourishes here and there.No messing around then. Quite simply, this is not just one of the best crime/comedy/romance movies out there, but one of the best movies ever.**SPOILERS**(for those who've seen the movie only!)For those people who want to know all those little film factsMichael Keaton plays the same character in both this film and Jackie Brown, which is based on another Elmore Leonard novel (Rum Punch), though it's made by Tarantino of course, so the links end there.Yes that is Samuel L Jackson in the van at the end.

But Soderbergh decided that his films would not be mere Hollywood pap, that he would take that success and put his name to smaller, more personal projects.  Oh dear!  The result was two of the most underrated films of the last decade, Kafka, and King of the Hill.  Following those set backs, and the wildly different Schizopolis Soderbergh began to make his way back to the mainstream, and although some would hail his new Hollywood movies as remarkable, I would argue that they in-fact show a step down for the director.  And the first step was out of sight.Based on Elmore Leonard's novel, it's easy to see how drab the film would have been were it not for Soderbergh's unique story framing, and the chemistry between Clooney and Lopez.  But it's hard to watch the film and not pick up on the subtle points in which Soderbergh is trying too hard to be Tarantino.  Tarantino was of course the director that had made the most fuss on the independent circuit following Soderbergh with Reservoir Dogs, and he himself probably saw ripping of the Pulp Fiction helmer a safe bet for success.  Foreshadowing what would follow with the seventies homage The Limey, Julia Robert's Oscar vehicle Erin Brockovich, and useless issue flick Traffic, Out of Sight showed a new Soderbergh, a Soderbergh all to ready to become the one-trick pony, using the same flash-back structure and jump-cut rhythm in all his subsequent films and sacrificing his once great talent.Out of Sight however, is early enough in the scheme of things to still count as a great picture.  The script is sharp and fast, and Soderbergh's loose direction fits the theme of the film.  Jennifer Lopez had not yet become that annoying cardboard singer J-LO, whilst Clooney manages to get through the film without a squint from under his brow.  There's also fine support from Don Cheadle, Albert Brooks, Ving Rhames, Nancy Allen and the very funny Steve Zahn.

The chemistry between Clooney and Lopez is unequalled and is simply magic throughout the film. Clooney and Rhames just clik as bank-robbing buddies, they are great together. Don Cheadle, Albert Brooks and Steve Zahn give unbelievable performances. The music is what brings everything together so well. David Holmes' score is perfect for this film. What p****s me off is that the best song in the movie is NOT on the soundtrack (the scene where Clooney and Lopez meet at the bar then in Lopez's room). Steven Soderbergh's directing is phenomenal, especially the non-linear way he tells this story. I know this movie wasn't a hit at the box-office so if you haven't seen it please, do yourself a favor and see it now!

Action, drama, comedy - everybody says something different. In my eyes it´s a romantic thriller with  irony and decent action. Clooney and Lopez - wow!  I could really feel the sparks between them -  especially in the scene in the bar with the falling  snow in the background. Sigh... By the way, it was genius that Scott Frank, the author of the script, decided to tell some parts of the story in flashbacks. It´s the best way to keep the audience  paying attention. Speaking of flashbacks - during the  whole movie, I had the feeling, that this film was made in the 70´s and was buried out in 1998. It´s the  mood, the music, the zooms of the camera that carries you back into another time. That´s amazing! Out of sight is another cult-flick from director  Steven Soderbergh.

This guy is one of the best actors working right now, and his characteristic performance in Out of Sight is clearly no exception. The unique bank robbery that follow the tie scene is both innovative and surprising, because you just don't expect George to get caught just because his crappy car won't start, especially after such a flawlessly executed robbery.The thing that sets Out of Sight apart from other action romance films is that it's got a sufficiently original love story that is propelled by a uniquely presented storyline. The way that time is twisted around in the presentation of the film makes it more interesting, because it gives the audience a way to go back and see what happens before that hilarious opening sequence. Jennifer Lopez provides the only downfall of the film, horribly miscast in her role but luckily the quality of the rest of the cast makes up for the terrible black mark that she causes. She's just too cutesy and too obviously put in the movie for no other reason than to have a good looking celebrity in her role in the film, despite the fact that she clearly doesn't belong. Casting her in this film parallels the absolute stupidity of casting Denise Richards as a nuclear physicist in The World Is Not Enough, the 19th Bond film which, sadly, was otherwise too weak to survive her laughable performance.Out of Sight not only presents excellent character development but also a very complex plot, which is one of the best parts of the film. The diamond heist that makes up the majority of the latter part of the film is particularly well done, even if the criminals were a little blown out of proportion. But at least the group of criminals presented is fairly diverse. You have a leader, a squirrelly know-it-all guy from whom the entire heist is nearly stolen, and they even threw in a clumsy fat guy who was more interested in the big steaks in the fridge of the house they had broken into than he was in stealing the diamonds. It was particularly amusing the way that that guy died, by shooting himself in the head after tripping on his way up the stairs to get George, who he had at gunpoint (which is weird, because I could have sworn that that scene was in Suicide Kings).At any rate, the thing that really made the romantic element of the film work (the tired theme of the law officer falling for the con) was that it was more realistically presented than they usually are. In general, you have the law officer pulling some strings or breaking the law in his or her own clever way to win the con's freedom, legally or not, but this was not the case in Out of Sight, and it's a good thing, too. Instead, in one of the best endings of any film in years, George is given a ride back to jail (after having been captured by Lopez after the botched diamond heist) in the back of a van with Samuel L. Jackson, who just happens to be a famous break out artist. It's not long before their brief conversation reveals to George the opportunity that Lopez put in front of him by pairing him up with Sam, and this sure as hell beats a riding-off-into-the-sunset ending. It leaves a huge hole for a sequel, but as much as I loved this film, I hope that they don't make a sequel. First of all, it would have to be DAMN good to do this movie justice, and second of all, a sequel just isn't necessary. Out of Sight leaves you with a smile on your face, because of what you can foresee about George's future as well as the cleverness of the entire film, and there's really no reason to go any further. Enjoy the film as it is, because quality cinema like this doesn't come along very often.

And youthink to yourself, what if I stopped? What if I said  something? What if?This bit of dialogue from Out of Sight perfectly capturesthe essence of the relationships between characters in thisfilm. Out of Sight is about what ifs and what could havebeens. What the characters do and more importantly whatthey don't do directly shapes their fate.As the film begins, Jack Foley (George Clooney), an agingcareer criminal, escapes from a Florida prison with thehelp of his loyal accomplice Buddy (Ving Rhames). In theheat of the moment, they kidnap a beautiful Federal  Marshall named Karen Sisco (Jennifer Lopez). She and  Jack are stuffed in the trunk of her car as the trio make ahasty retreat. Trapped in such a small, confined space, thetwo of them have nothing to do but engage in idle chitchat.Even though they are on completely opposite sides of thelaw there's a spark, an initial attraction that blossoms intosomething more as the film progresses and their paths  inevitably cross again.And so begins one of the finest Elmore Leonard  adaptations ever put to film. Where Get Shorty was a littletoo goofy and Jackie Brown was a little too Tarantino,director Steven Soderbergh and screenwriter Scott Frankachieve a perfect mix with Out of Sight. The film is fast andloose when it needs to be but knows when to slow it downand savour the moment as well. The result is a smart,  funny and stylish character-driven story.It doesn't hurt that the film features two very attractive leads.After a series of so-so films, George Clooney finally hitspaydirt with Out of Sight. His style of acting is perfect forthis role as he plays Foley with the perfect amount oflaid-back charm. This is typified by his character's  introduction -- the most pleasant, non-violent bank robberyever committed to film. Clooney has such a likable screenpresence that you just want to see his character succeed.Conversely, Jennifer Lopez is his perfect foil as a smart,tough law enforcement officer who can't help but fall in lovewith this charismatic criminal. She is a very attractivewoman but not above wielding a shotgun to apprehend a  fugitive.There is a genuine chemistry between the two actors thatmakes their romance work. And it is this relationship thatgives Out of Sight its depth. There is more to this film thansnappy banter and a hip soundtrack. It's a film about  making choices and taking chances despite the  sometimes inevitable, painful consequences. It is also anentertaining look at a collection of colourful characters andthe exciting world they inhabit.

It tries to take all the great elements of the genre, and make them work in a modern-day context---and it succeeds!  Example the femme fatale figure is not very politically correct in the 90's; it's not acceptable to blame all the evils of the world on a woman, is it?  Soderbergh twists this by making Lopez the antagonist, but as the law enforcer this time, not the law breaker.  This sensibility holds throughout the film, as we feel like we're watching a Film Noir, but without having to remind ourselves of what year we're in.The sight and sound in the film are top-drawer, including a fantastic, funky soundtrack.

George Clooney plays an escaped bank robber who develops a relationship with the federal marshal (Jennifer Lopez) on his trail. (Typical of Leonard's cool cucumbers, the word love is never mentioned.) Soderbergh seems to be seeking the same kind of off-kilter, casual chemistry between his leads that Stanley Donen was able to find with Cary Grant and Audrey Hepburn in Charade but Clooney and Lopez don't seem to jell--they seem to be nervous around each other. When they meet-cute in the trunk of a getaway car, it should be a tense and electric moment the film can expand from but instead comes off as awkward and strained with Lopez in particular unsure of how to react. The rest of their interactions are spent trying to recover from that failed moment. As usual, Soderbergh knows how to entertain his viewers with visual flair; he gets great support from Anne V. Coates' fluid editing and while Elliot Davis' camera-work is not as eloquent as Soderbergh's own, it does have its flashes, particularly in the night scenes. Lopez and Clooney are surrounded by a powerhouse cast that includes Don Cheadle, Ving Rhames, Dennis Farina, Albert Brooks, Steve Zahn, Luis Guzman, a wasted Michael Keaton, an uncredited Samuel L.

Jennifer Lopez is superb as a cop torn between profession and romance but ultimately witnesses the ultimate sacrifice. Other roles are rendered to formula to typical capers. Dennis Farina plays Lopez's father who presents her with a gun on her birthday. Ving Rhames plays Clooney's loyal partner who will play through to the end. Don Cheadle plays another criminal planning to hit the same target. While there is potential for greatness here, the end result is an undemanding screenplay that is out of sight.

He escapes from prison with the help of Buddy Bragg (Ving Rhames) and grabs US Marshall Karen Sisco (Jennifer Lopez) on the way out. She talks her way out by convincing weak minded Glenn Michaels (Steve Zahn). Foley is after some diamonds, and Sisco is put on their case. Only she might be falling for him.Director Steven Soderbergh has narrow the focus. This is simply one hot sexual innuendo after another between Clooney and Lopez. It does get slow and J Lo does get too cool at times. But it's a slow cool burn that heats up the whole movie. Clooney is a perfect sly fox. The game play between the two leads absolutely sings.

Even if you are not inclined by nature to take to him, you can't help it. He is just so watchable. And the female lead is Jennifer Lopez, that Puerto Rican glamour gal that everybody is always raving about, and whom I struggle to appreciate. (She doesn't look very Hispanic to me, though I know she is 100%. Maybe this all goes to show that Puerto Ricans are so much less Hispanic than, say Mexicans. I wonder if her parents danced around singing 'I Like to Be in America' when they arrived in New York. Wouldn't it be nice if they had?) The story is based on one of those endless novels written by the prolific Elmore Leonard, always good solid stuff. This time 'Jay Lo' is the cop and Clooney is the crook. Guess what? She can't resist him. So she is chasing him and sleeping with him at the same time. No physicist can provide an equation for such a combination of rest and motion at the same point in space-time, but the movies can do it effortlessly. There are some really witty lines in this film. It's just good fun, nothing heavy, even though it breaks all physical laws and permits 'charm' to be assigned to both bosons and leptons whilst in frenetic interaction, both the products of The Hollywood Collider.

Steven Soderbough is one of the best directors in Hollywood now and in this film he showed he could handle a lit star talent. The film has  a great leading performance by George Clooney and a great lead by J-Lo. The highlight of the film is the shot of J-Lo' ass.

The forgettable Story ambles along without much happening , while the camera work is its most interesting aspect. The acting is good , but it's only what you would expect from people like Vic Ryhmes and George Clooney. Look out for the cameo parts from Michael Keaton and Samual L Jackson.

The screenplay is awesome, I mean Scott Frank must be the second biggest fan of Elmore Leonard novels next to Tarantino. The acting in this film is very good. George Clooney is terrific and Ving Rhames is cool as his partner. I liked the cameos from Sam Jackson and Michael Keaton, it had that Quentin Tarantino feel. You won't be disappointed if you like your films character driven and not all out action.

I mean... Well, come on... Not that I mind when a director decides to be visionary or to turn the pop-corn screenplay he is given into a high art movie but... Well, let me say it like that. This movie could have been a great action comedy. It had the right screenplay and the right actors for that. But... Here is the problem - Steven Soderbergh did not have a clue how to make it entertaining. You know, that is what an action comedy is supposed to be - entertaining. But 'Out of Sight' is far from being an entertaining movie. There are visual experiments. There are long pseudo-meaningful scenes which do not add anything to the story. This movie is pretentious. But! There is just one problem but it is HUGE! The screenplay of the movie is not meant to be turned into a high art. There are some buddy-cop jokes for Christ's sake! Had this movie been directed by Richard Donner or some director like him it would be a lighthearted action movie. But no, Soderbergh wanted to be Serious. But the seriousness of his direction just doesn't go well with the jokes. This movie had to be fast paced. Instead it's pacing is incredibly slow. This movie had to be entertaining. Instead it is boring. This movie had to be funny. But it is not.I don't know why it is rated so high. I guess many people gave it good ratings because the were afraid they would look stupid if they didn't. There is no other explanation.

(Unbilled cameos Nancy Allen, Michael Keaton, Samuel L. Jackson).  Chemistry fueled adaptation of Elmore Leonard's book about bank robber Clooney escaping prison and falling in love with federal agent Lopez with high comic style and some excellent ensemble work make an entertaining heist flick turned-inside-out in a unique perspective thanks to Scott Frank's smartly written screenplay, snazzy cinematography by Elliot Davis and loose, fresh direction by the unlikely Steven Soderbergh.  Payoff indeed.

So a United States Federal Marshal is locked in a trunk (with a gun) and the bad guys are going to open the trunk not knowing the Marshal has said gun, so the Marshal just starts stupidly firing through the trunk lid making sure the bad guys are duly warned (before opening the trunk at which time the Marshal could have simply shot each bad guy deader than dirt). People, this was about the most believable bit in this movie. and, of course, just as in every movie ever made with any law enforcement character, this one was completely devoid of any backup weapon, the movie had to rely on the device of the gun being in the trunk completely unrelated to the Marshal character being a Marshal. Note to criminals if you disarm any law enforcement member and fail to also find and remove the small-frame pistol from their ankle holster, you will be immediately shot. Do not go by every-movie-ever-made as to the behavior of real life cops.

Frustrated by his attempts to get a regular job and go straight he walks out of a meeting and robs the nearest bank.  Unfortunately he is caught and sent down.  His last time in jail he and his friends met Dick Ripley, a businessman who claimed to have a fortune in diamonds hidden in his house.  Foley escapes from jail seeking revenge on Ripley but during the breakout he and his accomplices are forced to take a US Marshall hostage.  Locked in the car both he and she (Karen) develop a bond that continues &#150; even when Karen is put on the case to catch Foley and return him to jail.There was a time when Elmore Leonard adaptations were all the rage and everyone wanted one.  With Pulp Fiction making snappy dialogue cool again the studios wanted something that would work for them too.  Step up Get Shorty and Out of Sight to fill that need.  The plot here is potentially complex, with flashbacks telling two parts of the same story at the same time.  Happily it works and isn't confusing &#150; Sonenberg giving a different feel to times past as opposed to the heavier fuller colour of the present story.  The two stories drive each other and make the film feel very entertaining and carries it easily across a running time that had concerned me at first (something about that 120 mark isn't there?).The film is pretty violent and tough at times but remains cool and breezy throughout.  The dialogue is all good and the film takes it's time over things rather than feeling like it's in a rush to get somewhere.Clooney is effortlessly cool in the lead and is probably the perfect choice for laid back cool roles (see Ocean's 11).  His character may not get a full examination but then that's not really whats on offer here.  I hate Lopez with a passion but this is one of her best films and she is very good in it.  She isn't a diva here and gives a winning performance (being really sexy here helps too!).  Rhames is solid in support and Cheadle is very enjoyable.  It's interesting to se Brooks in a role that isn't a sub-Woody Allen role and likewise to see Farina play anything but a mobster.  Allen has a tiny role and Washington, Zahn and Guzmán are all good value in supporting roles.Overall this is better than some of the genre because it does feel like it has more substance than the films where style is everything.  However style is important here and the film has lots of it &#150; very cool and very smooth.  It may be too smooth for some who demand a bit more meat but there should be enough here to keep both camps happy. "}]
