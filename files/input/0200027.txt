I really never cared for Drew Barrymore, before.  However, my opinion of her has changed.  Drew put in an INCREDIBLE performance in this movie.  She really nailed it.  In fact, all of the actors gave commendable performances. I was so moved that I was quite uncomfortable for much of the movie.  The pain that was portrayed was so real that I almost regretted purchasing what I thought was supposed to be a comedy.  I'm glad I got through it - and an hour later I'm still stunned by what I saw.  This movie is well worth seeing. Perhaps the reviewers who hated it don't understand that you can be repulsed by another person's behavior, but you don't have to agree with them.  You don't have to accept their morals (or lack thereof) in order to recognize what they are going through.  And perhaps in seeing these roles acted out, you will see someone you know who has touched your life.  Perhaps you'll even see yourself.  I profess to have high moral standards, but I was not offended by this movie.  I just felt very sad.  I've known people like these characters.   I don't feel that they were trying to justify their decisions.They were just telling a story.  I also think that this movie was a kind of therapy for Beverly, who is standing up, triumphantly, shouting, I went through a lot of crap and I made it! Sure the viewer gets beaten up by this movie, but in a respectful way. This isn't a fairy tale.  This is a story about real life.  And real life is brutal.

It would certainly serve a terrific purpose, of how one small mistake can change the rest of your life forever.Beverly (Barrymore), at fifteen, falls in love with the quarterback of the football team. She decides one night at a party to show her love to him, by presenting him with a poem, she's written for him. Unfortunately, being as naive as she is, she presents it to him, in front of all of his friends, where she is then made fun of. Feeling sorry for herself, and very hurt, she runs upstairs to the bathroom, in the house where the party is taking place, crying. There, she meets the man she will soon fall for, and give herself to, for the very first time. However, this boy is not the boy she wants to marry, but is forced to, by her parents, because she is now pregnant. At fifteen, and married, she is now faced with a new life, and new responsibilities. The movie circles around this new life, and how she is able to overcome so much, with so very little. Her deadbeat husband, small and poor home, young child to raise, and at time hopeless future, all gang up on her, while she tries to overcome all of it. Her dreams are not unrealistic, but rather unreachable because of all the problems and mishaps that happen throughout the next fifteen years of her life.It's poignant, sweet, funny and honest. There is not one person who will watch this, and not relate to at least one thing from the story. Although it may take place in the 1960s-80s, it's still very true to life, and understandable.I would recommend it to anyone, and hope that everyone will see the power of a message this film holds. It's really an amazing true story, and there aren't many like this out there.

The 'feel good' feeling that this movie is gifted with, makes this movie a top notch drama/comedy.This will undoubtedly be Drew Barrymoe's greatest performances. Her performance as Beverly seemed as if she was just born to play it. The way her voice, sweetness and personality blended with the character, seemed as if Drew was playing herself and not Beverly. Brittany Murphy gives a solid performance as Faye- Beverly's best friend. This movie had a great cast including Steve Zahn- who was outstanding as Ray- Beverly's drug taking husband, Adam Garcia, Maggie Gyllenhaal, James Woods, and Peter Facinelli- who all gave unforgettable heart warming performances.The make up is also another reason for watching this- teenage,middle aged and older Beverly are all played by Drew, and it looks natural- it's same with Ray.

Drew Barrymore did a phenomenal job in her portrayal of Beverly Donofrio, as Beverly is depicted in the film meaning how the storyline was written - and it is definitely a story, but an enjoyable one nevertheless.I could barely find any similarities however between what took place in the movie and what actually happened to Beverly in real life. Had they produced the movie as the book was written, it would have been a much more intense drama with tons of sex, drugs and rock and roll, literally. Beverly Donofrio as depicted in the movie is nothing short of a Miss Goody Two Shoes compared to how Beverly actually was. But had the producers gone this route, it would have been very depressing to see.

Her behaviour after giving birth to Jason,conflicts to a certain extent to that of a normal mother.But was she a normal mother? We need to understand her! This pregnancy linked her to a unwanted man and brought life unexpectedly to a child.It blocked her dreams of going to high school and college,so her behaviour is justified to a certain extent.Two scenes,at the end,I consider as masterpieces.First her meeting together with the grown-up son at Ray's house,after years of separation,finding there a still drug addicted person,physically and even mentally finished.Ray feels guilty for all pain inflicted to her,but the only thing he can do now is to sign that paper authorizing her to publish the story of their life.Secondly the scene of Beverly and Josua reunited as mother and son for a short while,embracing near Ray's house,before going each one a separate way.Josua to his beloved,she calling her father to catch her up with the car and go to home of her parents.The last scene is particularly moving,father and daughter driving home in the car,sing that lovely song Dreams.This might be bout all the unfulfilled dreams of her life,or perhaps an illusion that all her hardships were nothing else than a dream.No dreams whatever,all she lived was true life.And this was a serene,nice end ,after so much drama unfolding in her life!

The movie makes us sit through the (long, lonnnnnnng and dreary) story of poor Beverly D'Onofrio, saddled with a drug-addicted loser of a spouse (a believably muddled Steve Zahn) and a little boy (who's, let's face it, adorable), who longs to leave her small town banality and become a writer.  We are forced to see her thwarted at every turn, betrayed by everybody she loves, blah blah blah...until finally her son is grown and she shows up at her heroin-addict husband's new hovel to find him married to (get this) Rosie Perez.We find out that Beverly has moved to NYC, gotten a job at a newspaper and has completed a book.  But guess what??!  We are never shown (or even TOLD) HOW she finally broke away and created a new life for herself.  The only interest I had in this soap opera from hell - in fact, the only real drama IN the story -  would have been the satisfaction of seeing Bev free herself from her suffocating non-life, but that transition was LEFT OUT, leaving us to slog through more heavy-handed (and WAY beyond tedious) scenes of supposed closure between Beverly and her now-grown son, in which every brutal banality in the book is foisted upon us in an attempt to make us feel something other than battered.  We do not.Even a wonderful actor like Drew Barrymore can't save this movie from its own mired muck. If you're thinking of renting this tripe, I suggest you drive down to your local In and Out Burger and ask for it Animal-style instead.  MUCH more rewarding.  (AND far less time-consuming.)

She had dreams of becoming a writer as a child but when she got pregnant at 15 all of that changed and she found herself married and living in a cheap house raising a son while trying to study for her exams. This is the start of her struggles where her husband never aspires beyond his next beer and she struggles with responsibility towards her son Jason. Years later, riding with her adult son on a trip, she thinks back over her years.The title and trailer pretty much let me know that this was aimed at a certain demographic that I am not part of, but I decided to give it a go anyway. The plot is a tapestry of moments across Beverly's life from her dreams to middle age; it is a mix of the comic and the tragic and it doesn't sit that well. Penny Marshall seems to want the comedy to come out &#150; even when it is not appropriate (for example Beverly allowing Jason to continue drowning for comedy effect) and this sits very uneasily with the more dramatic character side of the film. In fact the more serious (and interesting) aspects are mostly badly handled and fall a bit flat. In particular Marshall cannot cope very well with the fact that her lead character is a deeply flawed person that the audience easily dislike at times; the film gets close to examining this at the end but, typically, chickens out big time. The story is mainly quite dull then and the moments that are meant to be funny just seem strangely out of place.The cast don't help at all. Barrymore is serviceable but can't get to the heart of her character. OK, she isn't helped by the material but she swings wildly from playing silly at one moment to overdoing the histrionics. Zahn is not the first choice you want for a film with a story; he goofs well enough but finding depth is not really his forte and he adds to the shallow feel of the main story. Gilbert is hardly in it but Murphy is actually quite good, but then the material doesn't really ask much of it anyway. Woods and Bracco add familiar faces but really nothing else, in tiny roles. Perez plays a money grabber in a small role and made me wonder if she goes out of her way to find such characters? A minor thing that got to me as well was the fact that this is meant to play over years and years but mostly, nobody ages convincingly apart from costume and hairstyle Barrymore looks the same at the start and the end of the story and this pretty much goes for everyone. A minor quibble but it bothered me.Overall this is an average and uneven film. The story is interesting because it features such a flawed lead character and could have been interesting but it is roundly mishandled. The comic moments sit uneasily with the story as a whole, but Marshall seems happier with these touches than actually delivering the drama goods. The cast match her approach and their performances vary wildly depending if the scene they are shooting that day was a happy scene, sad scene or angry scene. Target audience might like it but it is far too flawed to have wider appeal. "},{"Title":"The Truth Will Set You Free!

Apparently, Roger Ebert and my mother may bethe only others who share my enthusiasm. If you saw it and foundyourself unable to relate to the heartfelt message that the cast andcrew attempted to deliver, it may well have been for one of two reasons.Either you were fortunate enough to have been born with a silver spoonin your mouth, or more importantly, you were not raised in a brokenhome.Director Penny Marshall does a wonderful job of craftily structuringthis film. The chronological breaks are cleaver enough to keep itinteresting for anyone, but not artistically modified to the point ofrepelling the more common viewers, who are prone to be its biggestsupporters.Drew Barrymore is terrific in her portrayal of Beverly D'Onofrio at agefifteen and beyond. If the film was rigidly based on a true story then Iam particularly impressed with the fact that D'Onofrio, (who wrote thebook), didn't sugar coat her inability to be a good mother, young orotherwise. Many parents who are brutally neurotic or behave selfishlythroughout the upbringing of their offspring don't even realize it, andare certainly not likely to publicize these facts as explicitly as shedoes here. She encounters a whirlwind of negative factors, which includea sea of disappointment and heartache that plague her throughout heryoung life. With this in mind, it might have been easy enough to depictherself as a model parent and still produce a book worth beingpublished. Whenever relevant, whether or not a film is based on a true storycarries different degrees of weight with me. For instance, SavingPrivate Ryan was very good, but had it been based on a true story; itwould have been phenomenal. On the other side of the coin, the validityof A Beautiful Mind is grounded exclusively on the basis of reality.Had it been based purely on fiction it would have been garbage. Yetanother example includes films like Life is Beautiful, it wasn't basedentirely on truth, nor did it need to be. The first time I saw Riding in Cars with Boys I missed the openingcredits and was unaware of the fact that the story was based on actualevents. After seeing the film a second time, with the true story aspectin mind, it took on an entirely different meaning for me.From the standpoint of non-violence based biographical dramas thatsuccessfully deliver a message that is heartfelt and true, I comparethis to some of my favorites. If you've seen Mask (1985), Stand andDeliver (1988), Awakenings (1990) or Remember the Titans (2000),then there's a good chance you'll embrace this film as well.Unfortunately, Riding in Cars with Boys may be the most popular amongthese recommendations so keep in mind the reverse is true as well.Some other non-biographical considerations to keep in mind when decidingwhether or not you might enjoy this film are, Fried Green Tomatoes(1991), Steel Magnolias (1989) and The Spitfire Grill (1996). If youfound any, or all of these to be worth while viewing experiences thenRiding in Cars with Boys may be right up your alley.

Her part spans 20 years, from the 15 years old pregnant girl with the dissappointed father up to the neurotic 35 year old mother. She's unlikeable in this role at every age.The worst scenes are the ones between Barrymore and Adam Garcia.

Laverne & Shirley comedian Penny Marshall, whose credits include A League of Their Own and Awakenings, pulls no punches in this sappy but unglamorous big-screen adaptation of real-life protagonist Beverly Donofrio's autobiography. Told largely in flashbacks, this cautionary yarn paints a bleak but rewarding picture about Donofrio's struggle raising a son with an undependable dad. When she learns about her husband's addiction to heroin, Donofrio kicks him out and raises her son alone. Not only does she take menial low-paying jobs, but also she sacrifices her dreams about college. Hollywood hellion Drew Barrymore of Charlie's Angels fame knows something about life's hard knocks from her highly publicized substance abuse problems, so she makes a believable single mom. Clocking in at well over two hours, Riding in Cars with Boys blends comedy with tragedy and features a first-rate cast including Rosie Perez, Brittany Murphy, and Sopranos star Lorraine Bracco. Indeed, this down-to-earth, realistic tearjerker should serve as required viewing for lusty high schoolers whose obsession with sex fails to factor in small town New England the consequences when a booty call backfires.Drew Barrymore plays the disaster-prone oldest daughter of strait-laced police chief Leo Donofrio (James Woods of Once Upon a Time in America) growing up in small town New England in the turbulent 1960s. Young Beverly displays a knack for writing poetry. After school one evening, best friend Fay (Brittany Murphy of Don't Say A Word) and she crash a Can't Hardly Wait house party. Starry-eyed Beverly reads a poem she penned for an egotistical football athlete she has a crush on. Callously, the stereotypical letter-jacket jock lambastes her literary efforts. A grief-stricken Beverly locks herself in an upstairs bathroom, only to find herself confined with lovable low-life Raymond Hasek (Steve Zahn of Joyride). Eventually, not only do they hit it off as friends, but also they become lovers. Ray gets fifteen-year old Beverly pregnant, and a shotgun marriage follows. Well-meaning but infantile, Ray isn't fit for fatherhood. Foolishly, he gets hooked on heroin, and Beverly divorces him. Our sympathetic heroine doesn't fare much better as a single mom. She blames all her failures on her son. As Jason gets older, he takes care of her. Beverly and Jason (Adam Garcia of Coyote Ugly) are driving out-of-town to visit Ray, who has since remarried, when the film opens with a flashback. Although Beverly has written a memoir about her misadventures, her publisher wants her to obtain a signed release from Ray before the book can be printed.Marshall and writer Morgan Upton Ward refuse to sugarcoat this ambitious but downbeat PG-13 saga about the perils of teen parenthood. The wedding scene when Beverly's embarrassed father thanks his friends for showing up is a classic bittersweet moment. Although the pace becomes sluggish and uneven, with characters drifting in and out of the story, the message about unplanned pregnancies loses none of its impact. Altogether, Riding in Cars with Boys qualifies as a must-see movie for parents, teenagers, and high school guidance counselors.

First of all, Beverly's parents did not force her to get married. In fact, they encouraged her to live with them so they could help support the baby instead of getting married. In the book, her parents were NOT supportive of her dream to go to college, which was a big part of the book that was left out. It was also Beverly's excuse for getting pregnant. I understand they leave parts out of a movie to edit it but they totally changed it. Also, the movie did not show how guilty Beverly was. They did not show her smoking pot with her husband and their friends almost every night. They did not show (except for when the husband was sick) that neither one of them worked and they were on welfare smoking pot all day, not taking care of the kids. I have the movie on tape and its great but a totally changed story. I understand, it was the 60s and 70s and a lot of people did drugs, but it still made her a bad mother and worst than the Beverly in the book. The part about her trying to get a scholarship never happened. In fact, she never even mention doing everything she can to get them out of there. (Something she said throughout the movie) She did not even make her husband get a job! She went to college way after she was divorced cause welfare paid for it but there wasn't any scholarship involved. In fact, she was not even a good student at first. But when she finally graduated, she had some job as a secretary or something. It took her a long time for her to do anything with her degree. If she was as practical as she was in the movie, she would have gone to school for something more realistic. And she was so selfish that she put all her money into getting her masters,(like it made a difference if she had one) that she was not going to put her own son into college. You would think she would want to be better than her parents. In the movie, it seemed like she did everything she can to make sure Jason went to N.Y.U. Or course, even in the movie every thing was about her. She did not care about her son's feelings when he saw his father. She seemed a lot more controlling in the movie, not wanting her son to move to a school too far from her. In the book she was more permissive. So anyway, if you want the real story, read the book.

And she decided that since her son ruined her life she would force him to make it up to her and make him suffer his whole life.  And then she wrote a book which is intended to make us care about her, and then Drew Barrymore and Penny Marshall made a movie out of that book which not only tried to present that as a heartwarming story, but tried to throw in some light comedy and period music to make the thing more charming.Possible spoilers aheadI HATED this movie.  I have never hated a movie so much in my life, and I can't imagine how many I have seen.  And that's because this movie morally offended me, trying to make me love a person who is so deserving of contempt.  There were many points in this film where I literally cringed or gasped at the way Beverly treated or spoke to Jason, and the utter hatred she was displaying towards him.  And that continued throughout his life.  I have never seen such a selfish woman depicted in a flattering light; even when he was 20 Jason couldn't have 10 seconds to make an important personal phone call.  Not when poor precious Beverly wanted him to take her somewhere.  I wanted to strangle her during that horn honking scene.  And to the fans of the movie who say Beverly redeemed herself at the end I sayNO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!That's exactly what she did not do.  After two hours of watching her torment her son, it was horrifying when he tried to confront her and she hit him and yelled I was a GOOD MOTHER!  And after actually showing him bursting into tears and pouring his heart out about how much he was suffering, the filmmakers tacked on some 10 second attempt at Beverly being nice on there and that was supposed to make up for everything.  No, I think that was completely forced and didn't make me loathe this movie any less.  Any minimal impact it might have had was undone by next showing Beverly talking to her father and acting amused/offended at the notion that she caused Jason's problems.Beverly had sex.  It was HER fault she didn't get to do everything she wanted before suddenly becoming a mother.  Jason didn't asked to be born; he was an innocent child who clearly had a good heart and just needed to be loved like the rest of us.  He deserved all the sympathy in this story, Beverly none.  And some might say that maybe I'm being judgmental; it's incredibly difficult to be a teen mom.  I'm sure it is; I don't know any personally so maybe I would have had a little compassion for Beverly IF the movie didn't also show Faye, who become pregnant at the same age and still loved her child unconditionally.  To anyone who dare try and justify that by saying that Faye was lucky enough to have a girl, and Beverly got stuck with a boy (and looks like that was supposed to be a big deal, I've seen that shot of Beverly looking at her newborn and crying so many times), that makes Beverly even worse in my eyes.  Maybe some people are unstable and can't help how they act, but if Beverly would have been nicer to a daughter, then that means she quite deliberately chose to mistreat her son, and I find that despicable.  Frankly if I was Jason and my only parent felt that way towards me, I think I literally would have committed suicide.  I heard this story was changed considerably from D'Onofrio's memoirs; I hope her actual behavior wasn't much worse.  I also hope Jason turned out all right and there really was an Amelia.Some miscellaneous thoughts -I read that Beverly was really 17 when she gave birth.  By changing the age, I guess they intended to make us sympathize with her even more.  Certainly didn't work for me, especially since, again, Faye was the same age.  It didn't help matters any that Drew Barrymore did not look 15 at all; all that that make-up and hair did was make her look like a really idiotic grown woman.-Certain scenes such as Beverly throwing herself down the stairs, which was played for laughs, were clearly meant to endear her to us.  The effort only made me hate her more in retrospect.  -Steve Zahn drew infinitely more sympathy out of me with his character.  Yes, Ray was a drug addict, and a bum, and a terrible husband, but beneath it all I got the feeling that he really truly loved Jason, a feeling Beverly never once gave in spite of how many times she licked her hand and fixed his hair.  Yes I am a guy, and I've read that this was the type of movie for which the label chick flick was virtually invented.  But don't let my gender taint the validity of my opinion; I'm writing simply as a person whose mother loves and cares for him tremendously and feels all moms should be like that.  And if they're not, they shouldn't be treated as nice people whom we're supposed to care for.  I find it very sad that there are teen mothers out there who, in spite of the circumstances, do their best to raise their children in a loving, nurturing environment, and are trapped in poverty, while Beverly D'Onofrio gets a major motion picture made about her.

I will admit, it's not the best one ever made, but I would say that its one I plan on watching more than once.Drew Berrymore is an amazing actress with a lot of untapped talent. I had been a little disappointed by some of her recent efforts (Charlie's Angels) in which her real abilities were not used or even touched on. I'd have to say that going into this movie, I was sceptical as to whether or not this would be yet another Angel flop. On a happier note, though, I was pleasantly surprised. She carries the character of Bev very well and in actuality, almost makes you see things from her perspective. In all honesty, I don't think anyone could have done a better job playing this role and anyone who believes that is fooling themselves.Steve Zahn showed much growth in this movie. Audiences are used to seeing him as a moronic slap-stick comedian. It was nice to see him step-up and try on a role more suiting for adult audiences. Adam Garcia gave a wonderful performance as well. His character, a bit whiney and unrealistic at times, seems to be the under-dog throughout the entire story...saving his mother from herself and each other from mental instability (although that aspect may not have been fully achieved, which is apparent towards the end of the movie).I would have to say though that my favorite actor in this entire movie would in fact have to be James Woods. He is by far the most realistic Hollywood dad I have seen in a long time. I couldn't help but smile and think of my own while watching him.Although the ending was abrupt and could have done with a little more explanation, it suited the story line. If you think about it, it ties everything together by bringing Bev back to the same place the movie starts out in.The best thing about this film is not the over all message of you can do anything despite what happens, but the hidden ones. Brittany Murphy's character shows that good friends will stick by you through the good times and the bad, but will also be willing to slap some sense into you when you really screw up. But I believe the most comforting of all the things this film conveys is the message that no matter how bad things are, no matter how much you screw up, there is always going to be someone there to forgive you.

It quite possibly goes through the entire spectrum of human emotion in the two hours you're sitting there watching it. It does a marvelous job of tiring you out; of making you feel exactly what the on screen character is feeling. But this film is far from perfect.The biggest problem here is that you're a little unsure of who the movie is about. Is it about the son's resentment of his mother? Is it about the mother's anger towards her son, her father, herself? Is it about this once daddy's girl's fall from grace and how she not only had to make a living for herself and her son but also had to try to win back her father's love which she once had in spades? The movie tackles so many emotions that radiate from so many different characters that it's hard to keep straight who the main one is in the moment.However annoying this problem is it in no way detracts from the enjoyment of the story being told though. You will either find yourself rooting for Barrymore (who showed such range and empathy in this role, proving herself to be more that the Rom-Com queen we know her to be) to achieve the life she wants or you will side with her son who thinks that she did a poor job of mothering him.This movie shows us that life can be brutal and unfair.

With Drew Barrymore in the lead, directed by Penny Marshall, this movie plays more of a family drama than the typical comedy-drama such as Uptown Girls (2003) or Lost in Yonkers (1993). While there are some lighter moments, the overall tone is serious and substantive. This movie has more elements in common with the more edgy family drama Beautiful (2000) about a woman whose life goal is to become a beauty queen starring Minnie Driver and directed by Sally Field. What makes this movie stand out is that its devoid of the typical unusual plot element that promotes audience interest like helping a flock of geese survive in the family drama Fly Away Home (1996) or a father who fights the odds as a homeless man and father trying to become an stock and bonds investor in The Pursuit of Happiness (2006) or a girl in search of herself in a culturally bound society and a special male-driven rite of passage in Whale Rider (2002) or a mysterious single mother who seemingly creates magic from chocolate in Chocolat (2001) or even Little Miss Sunshine (2006) that seems more focused on the oddity of humor in a different sort of light-fared family seeking to satisfy the interest of a beauty pageant of their daughter. Instead of a focused look at an event or a segment of life like Margot at the Wedding (2007), this extended look into the life of Barrymore's life and her experiences with her family over decades becomes sort of a personal mini-epic taking both a timely, at times leisurely examination of important dramatic episodes of a person's life echoes The Tree of Life (2011) or or even more interestingly enough the more serious drama found in the likes of Gillian Anderson's powerful performance in House of Mirth (2000). The biggest weaknesses of this movie might be Barrymore's portrayal at times comes across too young for the part she is playing at several points in the movie and the relationship with the younger man is confusing for most of the movie. Other movies in this vein worth considering are Georgia Rule (2007) and American Beauty (2000).

Sure, some moments don't leave any impact, but overall, this film does deliver some very charming moments that stay with you.Morgan Ward's Adpated Screenplay is good, all though some sequences, especially in the second-hour, lack the fizz. Penny Marshall's Direction is wonderful. Cinematography by Miroslav Ondrícek is picture perfect. Editing is average. Art Design is fine.Performance-Wise Drew Barrymore as Beverly Donofrio, is fantastic. This performance has to be among her finest to date. Steve Zahn as the drug-addicted husband, is so natural & believable. James Woods & Lorraine Bracco as Mr & Mrs Donofrio, are fabulous.

Every performer is doing his or her best, especially Drew Barrymore and Brittany Murphy. But overall I think the movie is marred by a rather weak 'present'-day story, and quite a lot of obviously dubbed lines.Personally I was touched by the scene in which Tommy appears to Bev in the evening and asks her if she's all right. It takes a lot of courage to indicate you're not, instead of just being polite. The way the actors reacted to each other in this scene was just great. Too bad the kid had to come along and spoil it.If you're into Jim Brooks-type movies you won't be disappointed with this one. "},{"Title":"Turns off cruise control and glides along effortlessly","Date":"19 November 2011","Score":"","Genre":"Biography, Comedy, Drama","Review":" Riding in Cars With Boys does an amazing job at avoiding hazards, caricatures, comedic relief, and most importantly, formulas. It's an exercise in mature and honest filmmaking, and every actor and actress is blessed by the great material they've been handed.The film tells the sad but heart-warming coming of age parable, taking place in the 1960's, of a young woman named Beverly Donofrio (Barrymore) who becomes a mother at the tender age of fifteen, gets married to the loser she can barely look at by the end of the film named Ray (Zahn), and tries to stay in school to secure her life. The story is true and is taken from the autobiography of the same name.Beverly is likable, but desperate, and there are many situations she gets involved in that could label her a bad mother. Frequently in the film I imagined the characters were sitting around a poker table and Beverly was dealt the worst of the hands. She plays them, hoping to score, but inevitably, risks are taken and her luck turns sour. She is ambitious and willing to win the pot, but she can't make a whole lot of the cards she has but to play them and hopefully upgrade them for some bigger ones.Her parents are played extraordinarily by James Woods, giving a performance just as good as he did as the pimp Lester Diamond in Casino, and Lorraine Bracco who does her best to pursue and cope with her daughter's hefty decisions.Beverly and Ray are with each other because they have to be. Are they in love? No, it's more of a mutual liking between them. They don't hate each other, although shadows of extreme disgust and dislike begin to show further in the story. They're with each other because if not, she'd be a tramp and he'd be a deadbeat scumbag. This depicts the time in the world where men stepped up and made attempts to father the child they mistakingly brought into the world. And the women turn to her books and schoolwork as much as she could if impregnated at a young age. Now, when a woman is pregnant, before she calls her boyfriend, she tries to secure a deal with MTV.The supporting work doesn't just stem from Woods and Bracco. It's everywhere. Brittany Murphy gives one of the best performances of her career as Fay, Bev's best friend who also is attempting to bring up a kid in this world. She is raising a girl named Amelia, while Bev is bringing up a boy named Jason. The young, vibrant romance between the two youths is woefully under-developed and that is one thing the film should've been dripping with.Steve Zahn is captivating as well. He's an actor that can play virtually anyone. A screw up brother in one of my favorite horror films, a goofball father, a drugged out loser, and an idiot backup to Jack Black and Jason Biggs.One other minor complaint is the fact that at some points the film feels more considered with reenacting the nostalgia of the sixties than actually developing the story or advancing it. Sure, the beautiful set pieces and photography compliment the script, but the overall pictorial aspect could've been ignored to focus more on the realism of the events. The Vietnam War is mentioned, and many other elements of the sixties, all of which are used very attentively and properly. Not gratuitously.Drew Barrymore is simply convincing and enigmatic as Beverly. She puts herself in the role of this desperate woman who frequently feels as if she needs to father her son and her husband. Her performance reminds me greatly of Natalie Portman's in Where the Heart Is. There's a depressing work of art, but both performances are so enigmatic and delightful that they shine a ray of sun on a plot so grim at some points. Barrymore portrays the struggles of a woman of the time period in a way that is very difficult to accomplish. She nails it with stunning honesty and piercing accuracy in her emotional struggles.And that's the keyword here; honesty. This film is genuine, and not sugarcoated. Life can seriously suck sometimes. The film makes no attempt to hide that. The things Riding in Cars With Boys is astounding and nonetheless memorable. It's a tender film with so much to show other than being a great coming of age drama. With the way it's filmed, acted, and written I'm shocked none of the credits read Rob Reiner. Starring Drew Barrymore, Brittany Murphy, Adam Garcia, Steve Zahn, James Woods, and Lorraine Bracco. Directed by Penny Marshall.

There is no drama, no humour, no extraordinary achievement, no morality, and the climax is so insipid that only the end credits indicate the film has finished. This is basically a video record of an ordinary group of people living ordinary lives in an ordinary town. If I want to see that, I can look out my window.This dullness is not aided by the performance of Barrymore, who really can't act and can barely feign interest in the job. Her character is central to the plot, but is rather unpleasant and one-dimensional.The only plus side, and without her I would not have bothered watching at all, is the fabulous and greatly missed Brittany Murphy. Nobody sparkles on screen like her, and had her character been the central one this might have been worth watching. She always gives 100% and deserves 10/10. The rest should hang their heads in shame.

She does not play, she BECOMES Beverly Donorfio and she makes you understand everything that woman went through and accomplished in her entire life. The supporting characters are great also her father, that is so willing to stand by his daughter, but also very wise not to see that she is heading from one disaster to the other. And her son, that had to grow up strong and mature earlier than his time in order to deal with the unusual circumstances that he and his mother had to cope with. And of course her no-use husband - the mistake she was paying for all her life...This movie is also an anthem to the human strength that may help you arise even after a series of bad choices and claim what is your own. It also gives the message that people may always find comfort in each other, despite their past behavior and disappointments.And, I will say it Drew Barrymore was definitely robbed of a rightful Oscar nomination for this film. Her performance had all the ingredients of such as distinction - this being the turning point in the career of an actress usually performing sweet creatures in light comedies that then goes and superbly performs in a dramatic film! (See Reese Witherspoon in Walk the Line, Julia Roberts in Erin Brockovich and Monique in Precious).However, Miss Barrymore had a very tough competition to face, since that year (2001) saw the emergence of Nicole Kidman as a dramatic actress in Moulin Rouge, the smashing break-though of Rene Zelweger (Bridgets Jones Diary), the veteran performances of Judi Dench and Sissy Spasec and, of course, Halle Berry that swept every award in the country...Still, I would like very much to watch Barrymore's portrayal of Ms Donorfio in that film again and enjoy the last scene (no spoilers - don't worry) with Everly Brothers' All I have to Do is Dream as the perfect background...

Her police Sargent father basically disowns her, and all of her dreams for a professional writing career are crushed as along comes baby and a drug addict husband. The movie is harrowing and completely sad, but director Penny Marshall handles it superbly and dark humor is laid on extremely thick. The result is a cross between and comedy and a drama, equal parts side splitting and tear jerking. Brittany Murphy is fantastic as Bev's best friend and the whole movie was cast perfectly, especially Barrymore and Steve Zahn as Ray.

She even tells her son (not once but several times, mind you) that he ruined her life- nice parenting! Penny Marshall could have done a better job with the way she portrayed Beverly D'Onofrio (played by Drew Barrymore).What a disappointment! Not one person dies in this movie, which says a lot about how depressing this movie really is because I didn't think that a movie without a body count could be so depressing. This was neither uplifting nor empowering.On the plus side, the acting was really good. Even Lorraine Bracco, who plays D'Onofrio's mother, was good in this film, and I usually can't stand her.

Drew Barrymore (as Beverly Donofrio) tackles her role, aging from a teenager to a thirty-something woman, with more gusto than we're used to seeing from her. The result is enthralling. Meanwhile, the ever dependable Steve Zahn (as Beverly's husband, Ray Hasek) is equally as good, showing us a well-meaning youth, then man, who just hasn't got what it takes to make a worthwhile life, even at a low level.The script is replete with pleasing one-liners, with the best exchange almost at the end. Beverly and her son Jason (Adam Garcia) finally have it out and when she tells him he is wrong to think she blames him for ruining her life and then thanks him for actually saving it, he says You're welcome with more emotional force than you'd think possible in such a phrase.The thin story and unmemorable music neuter these strengths somewhat, but this is well worth seeing nonetheless.Rating 6/10.

The film shows well the consequences of sex and becoming pregnant so young for ladies, they normally loose their time behind the babies and sometimes they did not grow up enough to do this work properly. In addition, some boys having these problems find in drugs and alcohol their solutions. The conclusions are of low education and low values in the societies where they live.

The characters know it but it's news to the viewer. The scenes are all done wonderfully and believably, the acting is excellent in all cases, but the whole thing is never tied together.

It took awhile for me to get used to the idea of Drew Barrymore as someone that was not only portraying a mother but that the film also uses flashbacks to show her life and thus, we see Drew next to a 20 year old son.  At first, this was very difficult for me to accept and my suspension of disbelief was just not happening.  However, the longer I stayed with the film, the more I forgot about Drew's age and started to see her character take over.  This was also helped largely by Brittany Murphy's performance, which was so utterly convincing and true that it was hard not to believe in whatever she did, thus strengthening Drew's character.  I avoided this film like the plague in theaters but I was very impressed by how much Drew Barrymore invested of herself into the film.  She just kind of leapt in and gave it her all and in the end, if there is a fault with this film, it is not with actors but perhaps with the director.  Don't get me wrong, it's a decent film and it does have heart, but there was something missing that I couldn't quite put my finger on and it was in the way the director chose to sculpt her film. The end was a little bit stilted - all is resolved rather quickly and rather abruptly, given that we listen to harping for decades about the ruins of the lead character's life.  I would have enjoyed a little more insight in the resolve at the end.  But all in all, an enjoyable film with the two young actresses really applying themselves.

Choices in personal relationships, family and, their defining moments. Inherent with responsibility, these choices are intractable, shaping the players pursuit of doing what is right for their children and parents; whilst they all endure the angst of what could have been, but for the poor choices made in the heat of passion and, promises in the dark. Riding is told in a series of lengthy flashbacks by Jason Donofrio (Adam Garcia), the son (likely conceived in a green and white '55 Chevvy 2-door sedan) of Beverly Ann Donofrio (Drew Barrymore) and, Raymond Hasek (Steve Zahn).  Beverly (Bev) grows up a precocious, engaging and, impatient boomer, in a 60's middle-class, small town in Connecticut, with best friend, Fay Hope Forrester (Brittany Murphy).  Beverly's Dad, Leonard (James Woods), is a cop and, somewhat sensitive father who, with wife, Teresa (Lorraine Bracco), are Mr. and Mrs. Average-Italian-American mom and pop.Bev is anything but average and, therein lies Riding's catalyst for spark, conflict, and change.  She is a young literary and budding writer, with ideas of continuing education, sights above the ordinary and, has dreams of college and bright future.  She could no doubt succeed, but for those pesky choices.Actually, the act of riding in cars with boys by itself is somewhat innocuous, i.e., if all one did in them was ride.  It's the activities when the vehicle is not moving (or moving up and down), that becomes both Bev's and Fay's problem.Bev is rather forward thinking when the ultimate problem for a young girl manifests, deciding at first to become a single-parent and continue her education. But in a major defining moment, she defers to her father's conservative wishes, agreeing to marry the lovable loser boyfriend in a vain attempt to placate and assuage her father's hurt and anger.  She really does love her father and, to a lessor degree her boyfriend, Ray, a nowhere Neanderthal (played masterfully by Steve Zahn).And so it goes. The harder Bev tries to continue the path to her dreams, the more she becomes mired in a dead-end, nowhere existence.  And while her challenges are continuous, unending and, inexorable, she is intransigent in her determination to make something of her life and, the life of her son's.Riding in Cars with Boys is the story of Bev's quest against adversity due to poor choices and, she is strong and willful and, will not give up.  The conflict of her relationships with her parents, child and, husband, drive Riding and its poignant message of implacable effort and, inevitable disappointments.Drew Barrymore shines in this first-rate flick of Penny Marshall's that has fine attention to detail and, solid supporting performances especially, Mika Boorem, who plays the precocious-adolescent Beverly. Coupled with a somewhat soothing soundtrack of period rock and roll, Riding is good drama with comedic relief and, ever-present irony built on the wrong side of those pesky choices.

At first glance it appeared to be a standard chick flick...a light drama with a little comedy thrown in. However, this movie failed to deliver on both counts.First of all, I suspect that you were supposed to identify and care about Drew Barrymore's character.  The problem with this is that she is selfish, self-centered, and never learns from her mistakes.  Never does she realize the error of her ways, and never does she come to her senses.  As someone else's review said, you feel more for the heroin-addicted husband than you do for her.  The only person that you feel truly bad for though is her son. that poor kid has to put up with a lot of BS and pain in this movie, and never does he get any sort of reward.By the time the credits roll, you just wish that all of the main characters would suffer a painful dramatic death.  You either wish pain on them or want to put them out of their misery.Don't read my review and think that I'm one of those people who only likes movies with happy and/or obvious endings either.  The problem with this movie isn't that it has no happy ending; the problem is that the story goes nowhere, has no message, and no purpose.

Barrymore plays Beverly,  a regular teenager who is boy crazy,  yet wants to go to college and have a real career and a good life.  But she and her best friend Fay (another treat of a performance by Brittany Murphy) both accidentally get pregnant by their boyfriends,  and even though they bond over their similar predicaments,  they both end up unhappy with the men in their lives.  Fay's husband divorces her and Beverly's husband Ray (the fabulously funny and gifted Steve Zahn) is a lovable yet shiftless husband who drinks too much and can't keep a job.  Eventually,  the couple splits up. I was very uncomfortable with Beverly's relationship with her son.  From the moment she finds out she had a son instead of a daughter,  Beverly seems to resent him.  They have their good moments,  but she seems to blame him for everything that didn't go right in her life,  and she even says so.  Poor kid.  What a burden to live with,  thinking you're the reason your mother is so unhappy.  Unfortunately,  this is a true story and it seems many parents resent their kids.  So I say now that I really didn't like Barrymore's character.  Barrymore did the most exquisite job of bringing a whiny,  childish,  blame-everyone-but-yourself-for-your-problems kind of character to life.  The way she pouts when the grown up son confronts her instead of just saying she's sorry she pinned everything onto him for being born,  so true to life!!! I wonder if and hope that these two have really reconciled in real life.  All in all, an above average dramedy.

It was more than worth the wait. Penny Marshall has done it again, directing a film that struck all the right cords in me...much like the movie Where the Heart Is ( A masterpiece itself-not to be missed).Drew Barrymore plays Beverly, a fifteen year old who spoils her father's (James Wood) life plan to have a perfect family by getting knocked up at the age of 15. While her family ponders what to do with her, Beverly has a plan already in formation(She IS a talented and smart girl after all). She will get a job, finish high school, and go to college. Her parents don't want a family crisis or controversy, so they convince her to marry the father of her child instead(Steve Zahn), who is a washed-up drip of a loser, yet a willing father and husband. Bev agrees, not wanting to cause her family any more grief.While this movie is meant to be dramatic, it offers some outright laughs during very intense scenes. At Beverly's wedding (she wears pink) her best friend Fran (The VERY talented Brittany Murphy from Girl Interupted and Don't Say a Word) announces to the wedding crowd that she is also pregnant. Could Bev's father have a worse nightmare?Fran and Bev buddy up, sticking together through life's What have I done? moments...missing out on the prom, watching their friends go off to college, having babies together, and doing anything they can to make money and leave their small town. They quickly realize their dreams of each giving birth to two girls( which they hope will grow up and be just like them), two pretty houses, and being best friends forever is not quite reality when there is no money, wandering husbands, and your water breaks. How gross Mom! Bev shouts as real life intervenes. -real life- Take 1.Drew plays a magnificent roll as a young mother who's character spans 20 years from the birth of her son. She is a convincing actress at every age. While she may be a self-admitted irresponsible parent and make terrible life choices through the years, she is a good mother..despite the fact that she blames everyone, including her son for her misfortunes.I was particularly moved by the ending to this movie. The ride getting there is just as poignant as you follow Bev's life from a young girl to a mature woman striving to be a great writer and publish her personal memoirs titled appropriately Riding in Cars With Boys. A perfect title for a woman who had life changing experiences everytime she did ride in a car with the men in her life. I highly recommend this film to all. I will go as far and say that it is also a must-own for anyone that appreciates a 'see-it-more-than-once' flick. 9/102001 132 minutes Rated PG-13 CC.

Beware!","Date":"12 May 2002","Score":"","Genre":"Biography, Comedy, Drama","Review":"  This is a perfect example of how a movie can be so completely different than the preview leads you to believe. It depicts the only funny and touching moments and alludes to a warm, nostalgic kind of movie. That's not exactly what you end up getting out of it. That probably takes up about 15 minutes or so, which still leaves the viewer with two hours of uncomfortable moments and empty characters.Although well made, this is a depressing film. It basically follows Beverly (Drew Barrymore) from being a pregnant 15- year- old to a 36- year- old mother with an ill-adjusted 20- year- old son. In between you get moments of loneliness, rejection, denial, and abandonment. While not a complete downer, it's not exactly the feel good movie of the year. It is based in fact, however. The story is from Beverly Donofrio's memoir of the same name. Director Penny Marshall (`Big') gives you the story in fragments through flashbacks and constant mood changes.The best part about the film is the solid performances. Just about every character is played by first- rate actors including Barrymore, James Woods, Steve Zahn, and Lorraine Bracco. Especially impressive is Zahn's portrayal of Ray, the father of Beverly's baby, who manages to go from a mischievous high school loser to a deadbeat, drugged-out dad.  If you're a fan of the actors or if you're ready for a sad flick, go check this out in the theater.

Things would have turned out a lot differently, if only...Beverly spends most of Riding in Cars with Boys, the latest film by Penny Marshall (A League of Their Own, Big) lamenting this fact.  She is possessed of a keen wit and a strong talent for writing, but lacks the insight to realize how she shaped her own life into its current form.  At 22, when her son is six years old, she is still complaining that she's trapped in her world.  By this point, she's working two jobs, studying like mad to win a scholarship to college, and dealing with her childlike husband, Ray, who has secretly been harboring a heroin addiction.  Not the life she had envisioned for herself as a teenager.Beverly's life certainly starts with promise.  She's already composing love sonnets of surprising poignancy to an insensitive jock at her school at the age of 15.  Then she crosses paths with Ray Hasek, who shows her more respect than she has received from almost anyone in her life. Even though she will later blame others for ruining her life, the movie makes it clear that she is the aggressor in their relationship.  You don't want to get involved with a loser like me, warns Ray.His warning certainly seems well-founded.  Beverly ends up pregnant, and misses her last two years of high school while being hurried into a marriage with Ray by her appalled parents.  She is forced to watch her friends grow up around her and gradually move on with their lives, while she remains in her small house with Ray on a street that seems like a favorite hangout of the drug dealers in the area.Ray's character is crucial to the movie, and he is played by Steve Zahn in a remarkable performance.  Zahn is known mostly for his comic roles as dimwits (Saving Silverman, Happy, Texas) but here he comes across in a more serious character.  Ray is charming at first, and genuinely good-hearted, but helpless in the face of his addiction.  He wants to do right by his family, but just doesn't have the capacity to fulfill their needs.  Beverly puts up with him as long as she can.  Listen to the dialogue in the scene where she explains to him why its time for him to leave, and watch Zahn as he reacts.  He understands.  When he turns up later in the film, it's telling that he is able to take responsibility for his shortcomings.  Staying away was the best thing I ever did in my life, he says, and he's absolutely right.Beverly, on the other hand, is still stuck on blaming others for her lot in life.  Her son, Jason, has picked up his habit as a young man, leading to a painful confrontation that highlights the complicated dynamics of their relationship, now that he is old enough that people mistake her for his girlfriend.There are quite a few moments of truth in the movie.  Beverly's father's toast at her wedding is perhaps honest, but cruelly revels in her shame.  There's Beverly's own admission to her best friend, Fay I don't know if I love Jason, or if I have to love him.  When the six-year-old Jason betrays his mother at a crucial moment, we can understand his anger toward her stems not just from her driving his father away, but also with the fact that Bev blames him for crushing her dreams.Having read the book of the same name by Beverly Donofrio, I was struck with the honesty with which she paints herself.  Yet in the end she doesn't quite come to the point where she understands that her life has taken the path she choose for it.  This film has modified Beverly's life a great deal, but in the end, she is still the same person.  It's a unusually honest and challenging film about the choices we make in life.  The underlying message may be that although it might be small consolation, you're better off accepting responsibility for your decisions than to expend the energy required to resent them.

However, I will unabashedly admit that this movie made me regard her as an actress with more respect.  As movies go, nothing pleases me more than a movie which makes me laugh and cry in the time slot of about an hour and a half.  This movie sheds a raw, comedic light on a coming-of-age story that is more true to life than I've ever seen before. Steve Zahn was absolutely incredible in this movie--he was the messed up, doofus, drug-addict you couldn't help but love.  I hadn't seen Brittany Murphy since Clueless and was astounded by her touching portrayal of Fay.Now, here's the part when I explain why I'm sitting on the fence about this movie.  One, I loved Drew Barrymore's character throughout the flashback parts of the movie, but once it got to when the son was in his twenties, I wanted him to push her out of the car at a high speed!  I couldn't STAND her.  The second part is, I think that the character Tommy should have been left back in the sixties.  Why bring him back?  I was hoping Beverly would grab the kid and run away with him, but Tommy made his cameo and then went right out again.  I hate when directors do that! Overall, I have a very positive opinion of this movie.  The various kids playing Jason as a little boy were astoundingly talented and we can all hope to see them in future films.  SEE THIS MOVIE.  It's great.

The first half of the movie Ithought was quite good, but it lost steam in the second and neverrecovered.  Barrymore plays a bright, talented, and 'going places'high school girl, Beverly D'Onofrio, who gets a bit too involved witha boy and ends up pregnant. The pregnancy changes the directionof her life in numerous ways -- from damaging her relationshipwith her father, to a marriage to someone she knows deep downis not right for her in the long term, to denying her a chance to go tocollege.  The movie is told as a series of flashbacks showing howher life had gone out of control.  While the entire movie is generallywell acted, the flashback sequences were much more powerfuland cohesive than the present-day ones.  Steve Zahn plays herhusband, a ne'er-do-well who dabbles with various addictions,with humanity.  Barrymore is solid as the younger Beverly, butdoesn't seem to have a strong sense of who the older Beverlyshould be.

Steve Zahn portrays the drug addicted husband too convincingly.  The son grows up on his own, more or less.

The acting is better than average, and the directing is deft. The time period settings are not vigorously in your face as they were in Forrest Gump which is a nice touch. For parents, the film will absolutely hit a chord since it focuses on the difficulties of being a mother rather effectively.Drew's character, Bev, is unlikeable in the extreme, but very multidimensional. Drew's acting is really dead on here, so she does not come across as a clone of her other incarnations. Bev is as distinct as any character you have likely seen in some time. To watch someone mature from an idealistic girl into an embittered, regretting adult is itself worth the experience of seeing the movie.But it's not a masterpiece to be sure. The characters are a little TOO annoyingly well acted. Every once in a while, I wanted to reach up and plink Ray (Steve Zahn) and Bev (Drew Barrymore) on the nose for being TOO self-centered and aggravating. Bev is rude, anxious, and whiny. Ray is ridiculous and pathetic. And Bev's friend is another one with bimbette moments that are like nails on the blackboard.If you see Riding in Cars With Boys, be fair and see it without a Hollywood state of mind. The movie is real, dealing with a painful story in a way far better than Angie (the Geena Davis/Stephen Rea horror) and without feeling contrived or manipulative.

But while there's nothing ostensibly wrong with this Drew Barrymore vehicle, it's hard not to have niggles when leaving the screen. Barrymore plays Beverley Donofrio, who falls pregnant at 15 and has her dreams of college shattered as she learns to deal with her son, her dropout husband (Steve Zahn) and her life. Which seems a very short synopsis, and that's the problem. Just because it's a book doesn't mean it should be made into a film, and certainly doesn't mean it shouldn't be cut. Because at two hours 12 minutes this really is stretching the audience. Barrymore's motivation for doing the film is defendable - she displays a whole emotional range and carries it off well. The drawback to this - blame it on make-up or on her face - is that Drew Barrymore isn't capable of looking 35, any more than she is looking 15 these days. The fact that she manages to escape the image of being cute and 25 for as long a she does is a credit to her. The supporting cast are able - Zahn, Lorraine Bracco as Bev's mother and Brittany Murphy as best friend Fay - but to be honest it's only James Woods playing Bev's disappointed father who consistently fills out his role and gives it real class. Mostly however the blame has to rest with director Penny Marshall as to why this film doesn't work. There are funny moments, and dramatic moments - but no sooner has the audience woken up than Marshall goes and buries the slim plot under the next wave of character self-pity and loathing. While you like to think you're as much up for a sensitive chick-flick as the next tough guy, the lingering feeling you're left with is that a car chase wouldn't have been out of order to lift this piece.

I wasn't convinced of her playing a 35 yr old, playing a teenager and a adult in her 20's is more her thing. Steven Zahn is always a great actor and can pull of good offbeat roles, you really could empathise with him when he had to leave Jason.

By the end of it you don't really care what happens to the characters.I admire Drew Barrymore and the work she has done before, she is a gun actress but felt her acting in this was patchy.  As a teen in the film her true talents came through as usual, particularly when she was trying to throw herself down the stairs - very funny.  But I didn't feel she pulled off being an adult at all well....just not believable. It was as if she was trying too hard or something.Maybe I'm being a bit harsh and it has some nice moments in the film (with some great performances by the child actors), but at the end of the day this film is dull, dull, dull and really could have done with some more work in many of the scenes.

She sits in a fan-backed chair, a prisoner at her own wedding, her eyes like sponges registering all the hurt and anguish she is feeling from family and friends, all because no one really wants to be there, least of all her. For much of the rest of the film, Drew's Bev will alienate us with her selfishness, even cruelty, towards those who give her love, but we the audience never stop caring about her, because Barrymore never loses that core truth of the little girl trapped in the awfulness of her basic humanity.Boys is reminiscent of another movie producer James Brooks had a hand in, Terms of Endearment. In both, a complex tangle of interconnected relationships are worked out in a meticulous, unblinking way. There's humor and pathos served up in equal, occasionally simultaneous amounts, and some unpredictable twists that keep the audience on their toes.But here's the thing Boys actually earns its tears. The emotion and heartbreak here feels real, not piled on with a trowel as it was in Terms. Sure, there's some business involving a child's tooth and some other business involving the Everly Brothers' All I Have To Do Is Dream where you can feel the strings being pulled. But it works, and there's no use trying to penalize the composer for writing an effective melody. No surprise cancer deaths, no convenient astronauts living next door. Boys is based on a true story, but anyone would recognize it for one even if it didn't say so in the opening credits.Great acting all around, great '60s ambiance. Nice to see my home state getting some attention, but I'd have liked it had they actually shot some of the film in Connecticut, rather than New York and New Jersey. (Why was that, anyway? Union issues?)I'm surprised to see this movie isn't scoring a higher IMDb rating, or isn't catching fire in a bigger way at the box office or critics' circles. It's a better movie than Terms, which is not enough towards saying it's a great movie, full of the stuff of life, that will probably be bopping a lot of people over the head in its second go-round on cable and video.

Granted I was not 15 when I had my child I definitely related to everything that she was feeling when raising her child, dealing with her father and the frustration of having to make decisions that make the whole world happy but yourself.  She grew in the movie and when done raising her child started living her life for herself. At times people portrayed her as being selfish but any decision she made was solely to make a better life for her son.  (good or bad those decisions may have been). Being a young mom without a lot of money trying to survive I could relate to the movie 100%.  I loved how she questions the true feelings she has for her son when he is young.  Whether she really loved him or was just doing the motions of parent hood.  I know that there has to be other parents out there that have been in this situation and questioned their quality of love and parenting.

If only we could realize that our parents were just people who gave the whole parenting thing a try - there was no 'destiny' or degree.  We were just along for the ride - and it is really their story, not ours.Our chance is now - our adult lives are our own shot and making our realities better or different.  And our children will need to live in our shadows in the same way.I walked away from this movie forgiving my parents and with a renewed sense of love for myself, and the chance that I have to make my own dent in this world. I highly recommend this movie.

Drew Barrymore and Steve Zahn were better than the movie, especially Steve as a likeable druggie. It's hard for me to believe that I liked Steve as a druggie, since I fell in love with Steve eons ago as the squeaky-clean Hugo F. Peabody in Bye, Bye, Birdie on Broadway.  But, a good actor should not let himself be type-cast.  Drew plays a character that is hard to like, and that's impressive, since she is usually so effortlessly likeable.  I recommend Riding in Cars... to everybody unless they need carchases and violence in their films to enjoy them.

I didn't find the escape. Instead, the movie validated what I'd been feeling when my kids get into incredibly stupid and dangerous situations and become thoroughly unlikeable. When Bev asks Fay if she really loves Amelia, or if she loves her because she has to, my heart literally skipped a beat. It's what I've asked myself so many times. Would we love our kids if we weren't told we were supposed to?It also resonated with me when the son talked about how everything was always his fault, how she always blamed him and his existence for ruining her life.It's a good movie -- not great, but good -- and unlike others who have commented, I didn't find it overly long. Usually, I strain in a dark movie theater to see my watch. I didn't once, and was surprised to see how late it was when the movie was over.Kudos to Rosie Perez for taking on an unattractive (in personality and looks) role. Helen Mirren has an uncredited small part -- I think she's on screen twice and has one line. Her character's behind the scenes machinations are major, though.The movie felt real. Maybe the addiction stuff was glossed over, but that didn't detract from the film. (I liked Steve Zahn in Happy, Texas, too -- similar kind of good-hearted but screwed up character.

The movie wasn't perfect at all but what it WAS good at doing was showing the difficulties and hardships involved in all these peoples' lives.There were a few things that puzzled me and which I still don't get. Number one is the fact that Drew never seems to age or change physically during the whole movie and it was rather puzzling and did take away from the believability factor. There were times people who were supposed to be years apart in age looked to be the same age. It was just rather odd. The other thing is the ending. I am SO into endings, if they don't flow with the rest of the movie it's annoying. It seemed to me that the final confrontation between mother and son ended to abruptly and the next scene it almost seemed like everything was all hunky dory which again challenged the levels of believability but I have to admit I did enjoy the last scene of the movie so that's a plus.Third-How in the world was this lumped in as a COMEDY? I mean it makes no sense. If this was supposed to be a comedy I'd give it a 1 or 2 because I didn't laugh much.

The movie begins with Beverly just at the point of getting her autobiography published, but having to find her ex-husband Ray (played by Steve Zahn) and get him to sign a release promising no legal action against the publishers, so she sets off with son Jason (Adam Garcia) to find him.The rest of the movie is largely in the form of flashbacks as we discover the contents of the book. Beverly grows up from a precocious child to a pregnant teenager, unhappy housewife, less than stellar mom and eventually successful writer. We discover that her relationship with her father (James Woods) faltered after she became pregnant because he felt personally ashamed in front of his friends at this scandal, her relationship with her husband (Jason's father) never had a chance because of his drug addiction and general lack of responsibility, and her relationship with her son was strained because, deep down, she really felt that he had prevented her from achieving all the success she had hoped for.It strikes a delicate balance between being funny and sad, but in the end I found it unsatisfying in spite of good performances all around because nothing ever really seemed to me to get tied up (except perhaps the relationship between Jason and Ray) although in the end there was hope for Beverly and her dad.

And in `Riding In Cars With Boys,' directed by Penny Marshall, Drew Barrymore plays a young woman who walks that constantly narrowing fence of decision, slips up (as so many of us do!) and spends the rest of her life dealing with it.  The burning question  Where will she place the blame; on herself?  Or on someone else--anyone-- perhaps even an innocent party, in an attempt to transfer that burden of lost hopes and dreams?  Ultimately, it becomes a matter of how you deal with the next decision in the wake of a bad one, which in the final analysis is the most important; because therein lies the true nature of one's character.	Fifteen-year-old Beverly (Barrymore) is a smart kid, with aspirations of one day attending NYU and becoming a writer.  But it's 1965, she's not exactly the center of popularity and she has a crush on one of the varsity jocks who, of course, doesn't know she's alive.  But at a party one night, she musters up the courage to approach him; suffice to say, it does not go well.  As fate would have it, however (and, oh, fate will have it's way!), a drop-out named Ray (Steve Zahn) is on hand, sees what's happening and becomes her champion for the night.  And it's the night that changes her life forever.  As Pink Floyd once said, `One slip, and down the hole we fall--'  And the real question becomes, once you're down that hole, what are you going to do about it?	From a screenplay by Morgan Upton Ward, adapted from the novel `Riding In Cars With Boys,' by Beverly D'Onofrio, Penny Marshall delivers an affecting, and often poignant drama that addresses, not only the choices with which Beverly was faced, but makes a penetrating observation about the generation and era that so affected her decisions, as well.  The reaction of her police officer father, Leonard (James Woods), to her dilemma, for example, gives a context to the story that is most telling.  And it points up how so often `where' you are and `when' you are makes all the difference in the world, as far as how and why decisions are made, and moreover, how those decisions are perceived by others.  Marshall does an excellent job of presenting Beverly's story, lending a subtle, objective perspective to it that is effective and thought provoking.  She captures the period extremely well, sets a good pace and knows how to extract the kind of performances from her actors that makes it all work.  Additionally, most of the action takes place in the &#145;60s, but is being viewed from 1986, and Marshall makes the transitions between the two time periods flawless.  	As Beverly, Drew Barrymore gives one of her best performances ever, creating a three dimensional character in which she captures and successfully conveys all the complexities of the individual, as well as the situations in which she finds herself.  She presents Beverly as intelligent, as a young woman coping with the consequences of a situation brought about by her own design who accepts the responsibility of her own actions, but who struggles against consciously placing the blame on others-- which is a quite natural tenet of human nature.  And the fact that Barrymore does not play her as a victim is a key element in the success of this film; it adds a depth to the character that makes Beverly entirely real and convincing.  It's a performance shaded with subtle tone and nuance, and most importantly, Barrymore fine tunes the various emotional levels of her character to a perfect pitch, hitting just the right note in any given situation, and it makes the story credible, and what she does believable.	Also rising to the occasion with a terrific, memorable performance is Steve Zahn, as the hapless Ray.  This is a character who, even though based on a real person, could have easily fallen into caricature; but Zahn makes him real by getting into his skin and using the little things-- a glance, an expression, a reaction-- that gives Ray that necessary depth to make him convincing.  This is a guy you can feel for without necessarily liking; a guy you can admire for his innate humanness, but hate for his very human flaws.  It's a performance that is especially effective in the quiet, reflective moments, when you can actually see-- almost feel-- Ray's diminished mental capacity.  You can see it in his eyes; that pitiful, hopeless attempt to process information, but failing miserably because it is simply beyond the capacity of the facilities with which he was born.  And by establishing that cerebral chasm that exists between Ray and Beverly, it illuminates their basic differences and puts their whole situation-- especially Beverly's-- into succinct perspective.  And Zahn's performance is in no small part responsible for bringing that contrast to light, and making it work.	Also turning in noteworthy performances are Adam Garcia, as Jason, and Brittany Murphy, as Beverly's best friend, Fay.  The additional supporting cast includes Lorraine Bracco (Theresa D'Onofrio), Rosie Perez (Shirley), Peter Facinelli (Tommy), Sara Gilbert (Christina) and Jordan Gelber (Kevin).  An insightful film that says much about individual capacity and the tenacity of the human spirit, `Riding In Cars With Boys' is well crafted and delivered entertainment that will be a transporting experience for some, while perhaps providing some guidance and inspiration to others.  In the end, it's a thoughtful, heart-felt meditation on life; a gift to all of us through the magic of the movies.  I rate this one 9/10.

Although Barrymore's Bev has a complicated relationship with her son, barely 15 or so years younger than she, this complexity is weakened by the director's will to recreate the &#145;60's, which she does well, and unwillingness to tackle larger issues associated with teenage pregnancy and drug addiction.Barrymore's self-centered Bev, who has a writing ability that doesn't translate into the screenplay, is never sympathetic enough for us to care a whole lot about her cliched history.  Marshall hints at subversion in her crosscutting from the &#145;60's to 1986 by tempting us to think mother and son riding in their car could be lovers-but the Freudian undercurrent is lost amid the disturbing dysfunction of teenage father Steven Zahn's addiction to heroin and Barrymore's unbelievable stupidity about remaining in a nowhere place.Based on the true story of writer Beverly Donofrio, this film could have used Kirsten Dunst's knowing sarcasm and Madonna's charisma. What it does do well, however, is show the eternal struggle between mother and child, between the desire to be loved and the need to let go.The film is a long ride to a place and time we all have been in better movies last summer like `Hearts in Atlantis' or `Ghost World.'

My guess is that this film probably didn't receive as much advertising as it deserved.My first impression of the film was that it was a chick flick, but that didn't really matter because I have found some chick flicks actually amusing (for example P.S. I Love You). Besides that, the story follows Beverly Donofrio who, as a child, knew exactly what she wanted to do in her future until an unexpected pregnancy at the age of 15 put her life in a hault.Drew Barrymore really is a talented actress. She is probably the most charming and easiest-to-relate-to actress in today's Hollywood. There's something about her upbeat and charismatic personality that made her so easy to love in this movie. She truly made this movie a hit and I don't think anyone could have played the role of Beverly Donofrio like she did. What impressed me the most was how she carried this movie on her own throughout and I haven't seen many actresses achieve that recognition (most notable is probably Julia Roberts as Erin Brockovich). Also, Brittany Murphy was a great addition to the cast and the chemistry between Barrymore and Murphy was brilliant.The story itself is depressing and happy. It's really hard to explain. I couldn't decide whether or not it was a good thing she got pregnant at such a young age or it was a complete mistake that ruined her whole entire life. I guess it's something you would have to guess on your own while wathcing it. I liked how the film showed Beverly grow from a young confident girl to a more mature and confused individual.I personally enjoyed this film but I'm not sure how other guys would feel watching.

The film contains some genuinely funny moments, but suffers from the need to have Drew Barrymore play a woman who ages twenty years over the course of the story; she seems, inevitably, too womanly as a girl and too young as a late-thirty-something. More fundamentally, the film appears to have two slightly contradictory purposes. On one hand, it looks at how a parent might find themselves sacrificing their own happiness for their children's, or feeling justly guilty if they do not. However much you love your children, such stresses are a natural (and arguably neglected) aspect of parenthood, and if you're a single parent, then they're likely to be greater than if you have a better support network. This certainly makes for a more interesting theme than the vacuous I love you, kids attitude that permeates Hollywood movies whenever they want to show us that their hero/heroine has a heart of gold. The other idea is also not bad more comic, it's based on the awfulness of growing up with a self-obsessed drama queen for a mother. But combining both ideas is difficult, as to play up the second de-legitimises the first, and this movie lacks the subtlety to make the combination work. The film is also weakened by the way it presents the child in question in a wholly favourable light; it even displays a more forgiving attitude to the utterly useless father than it does to Drew's character, as if his hopelessness properly transfers full responsibility onto the mother. Perhaps it was a mistake to wrap the story of the mother through the narration of the perfect son, a move that tells the audience what to think a little more clearly than necessary, and the heartwarming ending adds nothing to the story. Overall, this is a film which betrays only hints of its potential; but it should make you smile nonetheless.

I didn't think much of it. All I heard was featuring Drew Barrymore, and then I decided I didn't want to spend money on a movie ticket to see her in a leading role, since I hadn't(and still haven't) seen an impressive performance by her. Then, for the last week or so, I began seeing commercials for its airing on TV. At first, I couldn't for the life of me tell the commercials apart from those advertising Home Fries(pregnant Barrymore, dimwitted father, etc). Still, I decided to give it a chance. I think I held out about half an hour, and then the film simply got too boring for me. The plot is good enough, and it develops nicely. The pacing is worse. What really tears this apart is the characters. Beverly comes off as a self-absorbed, pretentious, stubborn woman with the mind of a little girl. It's heavily hinted at that she's very intelligent and an excellent writer(which I understand the real Beverly was), but we are never convinced of this. Barrymore does an awful job of bringing her character to life; I never cared in the least about what happened to her(which may be part of why I only watched with half an eye after the first half hour). James Woods is terribly miscast. Brittany Murphy does a fair job of her character, but she's given far too little to work with. Steve Zahn does a good job, considering this is the first even slightly dramatic role I've seen him in(I don't know if he's actually done any other drama). On the outside, the film looks like it's about Beverly's relationships with men; when you look a little deeper, you'll see it's about choices and consequences. The problem is, it doesn't seem like it. I never felt like Beverly made the wrong choice. I felt like she just had problems, and blamed them on her unwanted son. Obviously, this is not what the director meant... but either she was unable to communicate her point properly, or Barrymore just lacks the capacity to play anything other than an airhead. I'm almost entirely certain that the book is far, far better, but I probably won't read it. After seeing such an embarrassing attempt at bringing it to the silver screen, I doubt I would be able to read it unbiased. Whether this movie was ruined by director Penny Marshal's inability to create something solid or Drew Barrymore's poor acting performance, I'm not sure. But the fact of the matter is, it is ruined. It is just not a very good movie, no matter how you look at it. If you're reading this and you're interested in the story, go read the book. Stay away from this movie. If you've read it and enjoyed it, stay even further away. From what I hear, it's wildly inaccurate. I recommend this only to very big fans of the actors in it.

The character Bev was raised in a middle class family with her parents. Her father Mr. Leonard D' Onofrio a cop played by James Wood and, her mother Mrs. Teresa D' Onofrio a housewife played by Lorraine Barrco . Drew Barrymore's character in the movie Bev is a smart, beautiful young woman who can't wait to grow up and accomplish her dream of moving to New York to become a writer. Her life takes its first detour when she becomes pregnant at 15 with her son Jason D' Onofrio played by Adam Garcia. In which, his character struggles with a complex relationship with his mother Bev throughout the film. Bev still desires to finish high school and attend college but, she is forced to put those goals aside. She reluctantly marries her son's father, Raymond Hasek played by Steve Zahn. Ray a dropout, heroin junkie messes up her life from the time she meets him until the time she lets him go. This movie is a perfect real life illustration showing just because your life takes a detour does not mean you can not accomplish your dream.Throughout the movie Drew Barrymore's life takes numerous detours. She gets pregnant at a young age. She forces herself to marry someone she did not love because of her parents. And she had to learn how to love and care for a child that she did not want. In the end, she was able to take the detours and arrive at destination point, she was able to achieve her dream of becoming a writer. She used her life of love, loss, and heartache which she incorporated into an inspiring auto- biography about the trails and triumph of taking an unbeaten path and still arriving at her dream.Ms. Drew Barrymore does a wonderful job in this film. Her acting is brilliant. Her performance seemed as if she once lived this life. Steve Zahn also gives a solid performance as Ray Hasek, Beverly's junkie husband. This movie has a great cast Brittany Murphy, Adam Garcia, Rosie Perez, James Woods, Lorraine Bracco, Pete Facinelli, and Maggie Gyllenhad. Together they all brought the movie alive, the actors/actresses really drew a vibrant and interesting picture of the characters they depicted.After viewing Riding in Cars with Boys I thought about another movie I really enjoyed similar to it called Rudy. This movie is also based on a real life story that is relatable. A man that had a dream and no matter what life detours he went through he still accomplished his dream. Movies based on true events cater more to my preference. These films successfully drawl the audience in by creating an honest parallel between real life and real events. I recommend everyone see this film especially single parents. I know how hard it is when life takes you in a totally different direction from where you plan to go. But if you continue on and never give up you will be able to still accomplish your dreams.

You can call her Bev. Her story begins in Wallingford, Connecticut in 1961. Bev couldn't wait to grow up and find the man of her dreams. That Christmas, she wanted a brassier so she could show off her bosoms to the boys at school. Her father, Officer Leonard D'Onofrio, would have nothing of it. Well, 4 years later- a teenage Bev accompanies her best friends, Fay Forrester and Tina Barr, to a party at Sky Barrister's house. Bev had a crush on Sky and had written a poem for him. Sky scoffed at the poem and his friends laughed at it. A devastated Bev runs upstairs to the bathroom and started crying. And it was there that she met the man she would spend the rest of her life with--unfortunately. His name was Ray Hasek, he was a crude, crass, low-class teen who drank alcohol, smoked cigarettes and used the bedet as a drinking fountain. When he heard why Bev was so upset, he decided to go down and pick a fight with Sky, who was three heads taller than Ray. Ray won the fight because he had such a hard head. Then Ray and Bev accompany Fay and her beau Bobby to a make-out session in the car. Fay and Bobby get right to work while Bev and Ray talk a bit first. Pretty soon the kids are discovered by, of all people, Officer Leonard D'Onofrio! Well needless to say he was very angry at his daughter; Now we flash forward to New York City, 1986 where a young man named Jason is meeting up with Beverly. Jason and Bev have known each other for many years and amazingly, they are not boyfriend and girlfriend. No, they are mother and son. It's true! It all started back in 1965 when, after seeing Ray more and more, Bev discovers she is...Pregnant! She was devastated. She couldn't think how to tell her parents because she knew they would go ballistic. And they did. Leonard and Teresa were very upset, but they didn't even have to yell. They just sat and gave Bev the cold shoulder.Bev didn't want to marry Ray, even though it was the best thing to do now. But after the attempt to throw herself downstairs didn't work, she decided to marry him after all. The wedding and the reception were a lot of fun and everybody was having a good time, except for the bride. It was there that Fay announced she was pregnant too, so that perked Bev up a bit. Later that night, Ray shows Bev their new house a small starter home at the end of a cul-de-sac. Ray got a job as an apprentice carpenter and would drink off and on. Mostly on. Pretty soon the blessed event took place and Bev had her baby. She was hoping for a girl, but got a boy instead. She named him Jason. Bev did not let her new duties as a mother interfere with her school work, especially since she wasn't very attentive to her new son at all. And when she changed his diaper, he peed right on her! Well as time passed, Jason grew and grew, and so did the problems with Bev's marriage. Bev had a meeting with the college board regarding her scholarship and Ray was not around to babysit Jason so Bev had to take him with her. She was denied the scholarship, probably because Jason was so disruptive. Well, before long, Jason nearly froze to death and drowned because his inattentive mother wasn't watching him and he got too close to Fay's pool; 1972- Jason's sixth birthday party. Things were starting to look up again. Bev's old friend Tommy invited her out to Berkeley, California to go to school. She convinced Ray and Jason that it was a good idea and they agreed. So they began packing.But before long, Bev learns a terrible secret about her husband he's a drug addict. He's been spending their money on heroin. He wanted to quit but the road to recovery was not easy for him. Not at all. And even though he said he quit, he didn't. He kept taking a little bit of heroin each day to stay straight. That made no sense to Bev, who was naturally furious about it. She kicked Ray to the curb and so he moved out. Ray bid a tearful goodbye to Jason and then left. After that, life for Bev and Jason got worse. Desperate for money, Bev allowed Ray's friend Lizard dry out weed in her oven. Bev and Fay helped. But pretty soon Jason and Amelia, Fay's daughter, tell the police what their mothers were doing and so they went to jail. The arresting officer Bev's father. Bev and Fay then had to break up, because Fay's new benefactor (she divorced Bobby a few years ago when he met a new girl overseas in 'Nam) said he would help her only if she moved back to Arizona and would never see Bev again. Another tearful goodbye, then Fay was gone. Bev was convinced her life was officially ruined. Now she had no money to go to N.Y.U and become the writer she had always dreamed about. Jason soon fesses up and says he was responsible for Bev getting thrown in jail. Well the frustrated Bev told Jason that he was responsible for all the bad that had happened and really chastised him for it. Flash-forward to the present day, 1986, Bev had written a book on her life and before it can be published, they would have to find Ray so he could sign an insurance contract. Ray was now living in a trailer with his new wife a horrible woman named Shirley, who wanted money in exchange for Ray's signature. That was out of the question so she kicked Bev and Jason out. But secretly, Ray met up with Jason later and signed the paper. Jason also took that opportunity to tell Bev what he really thought of her parenting and she stormed off. But they meet later and make-up. Jason wanted to transfer from N.Y.U to a school in Indiana where his girlfriend Amelia was. Bev finally let him, so Jason left. Now there was only one loose end left to be tied, and so Bev finally made peace with...Her father.Well, what can I say about Riding in Cars With Boys? Other than Drew Barrymore CAN act. I never thought she could. I just thought she was an overused actress with no abilities. Boy was I wrong! She also appeared in E.T. at the age of 7. That same year she hosted Saturday Night Live. I wonder what it was like having a 7-year-old girl hosting an adult-themed comedy show. Also in the cast were James Woods (Casino), Academy Award Nominee Lorraine Bracco (Goodfellas), Brittany Murphy, Steve Zahn, Sara Gilbert, and Adam Garcia. This movie is based on a true story by Beverly D'Onofrio. Barrymore is so convincing in the role. She really proved to be an irresponsible, incompetent girl who was a pretty bad mother to her son, but when you really look at it, she did have a tough life. Her son forgave her so she had to have done a good job at some point. Everybody in this movie was very good in their performances. Very good. There are some very funny moments and some very serious and dramatic moments; Directed by Penny Marshall from Laverne & Shirley. So check out Riding in Cars With Boys today, won't you?

As is often the case with movies, it isn't the basic story that's the problem, it's what's done with it - resulting in arguably Penny Marshall's least effective movie to date.Drew Barrymore can't be faulted for wanting to do something with a bit of substance to it, but she's more effective in the flashback scenes than in the 1986 framework (in spite of the makeup, she still doesn't look old enough to be Adam Garcia's mother, but she gives it the old school try); it's not really her fault that the movie doesn't come off... then again, it never is. Blame the director and screenwriter Morgan Upton Ward; the writing is horribly uneven throughout and never settles down to a really compelling tale, and though it's not a one-woman show too many of the other characters are underused - the movie could have used some more examination of the people around her, and instead it wastes some good actors (Lorraine Bracco and James Woods as her parents, Brittany Murphy as her best friend, Steve Zahn as her loser of a husband, and particularly Maggie Gyllenhaal as Murphy's grown-up daughter - who appears for about two or three minutes towards the end). When a movie relies on endless period tunes, beware - although it's genuinely blackly funny when our heroine tries to induce a miscarriage by throwing herself down the stairs with Skeeter Davis singing The End Of The World. This is also the rare movie with a pregnant central character who gives birth off-camera, but too many other things about the movie don't work; plenty of strong moments (like Zahn's heroin withdrawal juxtaposed with Barrymore dancing to her son's favourite record), but nothing to really tie it together. All concerned deserve a better movie; hardly a disaster, but only for fans of Drew, Brittany and the rest. Or people who haven't the sure-to-be-superior source.

Beverly must sacrifice her original plans and marry her son's father, Ray, also played wonderfully by Steve Zahn. She lacks the motive of love, so when Ray's somewhat good-natured but weak disposition leads him to the prison of drug addiction, her next decision is not too difficult. Drew Barrymore's likeability and honesty on camera saves her from her flawed approach and inability to age correctly throughout the picture (but let's note that the latter is not solely her fault). However, the rest of the cast are undoubtedly believable as somewhat confused, but good-willed citizens of the not-quite-middle-class.  Steve Zahn's portrayal of a hopeless, yet loveable loser is fabulous, and James Woods gives an extraordinary, yet understated performance as a father trying to do what's best but not always succeeding. Others, including Adam Garcia as Beverly's troubled son and Britney Murphy as Beverly's best friend give great, charming performances as well. This is a movie that effectively and humorously explores how fighting for a dream can sometimes overshadow what is really important in our lives, but not having one at all can lead to a self-destructive, paralytic life. Beverly must learn that her determined ambition to overcome adversity may also be equally as reckless and sometimes plans for the future must change, and even so, things will not always go according to plan.The female characters are depicted much more realistically than in the favorite romantic comedies of today, so women should find this movie easy to relate too, even if they didn't have a baby out of wedlock. There are some genuinely touching and funny moments, but the romance is too gritty (and certainly not the main focus) to make this a full fledged chick flick. Females should love it even more, simply because of this.What is frustrating about this film, though, is I feel the story was not given enough justice. There were uneven moments throughout the picture, and Drew barely delivers. But the script could stand alone, and with the help of great actors, it triumphed!

She goes for a ride with her father and you begin to understand that Beverly and father don't see eye to eye very often.  Beverly was a girl who just wanted to fly away from her childhood.  Her parents encourage her to stay young, but she can't shake her precocious attitude.   At a party, Beverly (at 15) puts that adult state of mind to the test when she sleeps with some loser she met in the bathroom.  This one mistake starts her on a road to misery.   She discovers that she is pregnant, and to top it off she must marry the one night stander.  Luckily for her, her best bud Fay, gets pregnant too and they can experience it together. Ray, the father of her un born child finds them a home to live in.  And as the cover says, their place a house to small to hold Bev's dreams. All of her hopes of becoming a successful author go down the drain, as she and her drop out hubby must worry about how to earn a living. At first the problems seem small, and Bev's unhappiness is concentrated on her high school equivilency.   But the doubts of love for her offspring, the shame from her father, and the constant irresponsibility of her spouse tell you just how much she regrets her decisions.  She wishes she could do it all over again, but maybe just maybe it turned out all right for her, see for yourself.

Not so much because of the subject matter, but more because of how the subject matter is so mismatched with the way that it is handled.  There are times of goofiness and humor in this film when they simply do not belong, and the main character is trying to be passed off as likeable and sweet when she is anything but the two.  Point blank Penny Marshall was the absolute wrong choice to direct this film.I say this not because she is not a good director; but A League of Their Own this film is not.  I watched this movie expecting a sweet Drew Barrymore vehicle in which she shows off a few acting chops.  I got what I expected...and a whole heck of a lot more.  The film deals with so many issues, it can't possibly contain all of them in less than two hours effectively.  First of all, teen pregnancy.  Second, religious parents who believe children should not be born out of wedlock, which leads to teen marriage.  Third, teen motherhood.  And fourth, and most important, the effects of treating children from the day they were born like they were a mistake.I could name scene after scene that true feeling and emotion was substituted for either sentimentality or a dim joke.  From the moment Jason is born, Barrymore's character, Beverly, is disappointed.  But they try to make it light by her disappointment in the fact that she had a boy, not a girl.  She pouts and whines and we are supposed to laugh.  Uh, yeah, not funny.This bothered me very much.  The character of Bev was a horrible human being.  Yes, I feel bad for her throughout the movie.  She was smart and had a huge chance at a good life, but look what riding in cars with boys got her &#150; a kid.  So while I felt bad for Beverly, I felt worse for Jason, her son who lived his life trying to achieve the most impossible of goals making his mother proud.And Steve Zahn worked well enough with what was given him, but I am convinced that if a director more suited to this film helmed it then Zahn would have been nominated for an Oscar.  But his character is such a contrived jerk, that is all we see him as.  And his final scene could have been one of the most touching, poignant moments in movie history, but instead we get this cheesy, rushed, anti-climactic scene that serves more as a platform for Rosie Perez to yell a lot.In the end, I cannot see if Beverly has changed.  I cannot see that she has become a better person.  The film was okay, and Drew Barrymore's performance was fine, considering how the movie turned out.  But it could have been better.  The acting, the directing, the story, the emotion, the handling of such delicate and important issues, everything about this movie&#133; it all could have been so much better.

After a few minutes of watching, however, I realized that, once again, a modern Hollywood preview duped me into wasting my money on a film such as this.  It's not that this film is horrible; it's just that there is no cohesion to the story and the only character with whom the audience sympathizes is the husband - the one we, the audience, are not supposed to like.

Donofrio also co-produced the film, so the final product is probably a reasonably close to the events as she hoped to have them conveyed.   Though I have not read the book, the reviews and reader comments seem to indicate that this was a sanitized version of her life, leaving out much of the decadence that followed the failure of her marriage.  Nonetheless, it is a stirring story about overcoming adversity, self imposed though it was, to triumph and fulfill her dream of getting a college education and becoming a published writer.Penny Marshall directs this film and turns what probably should have been a melodrama into a bittersweet comedy.  Marshall is excellent at presenting the human dynamic, and that is evident here.  This film is also an outstanding period piece, with meticulous attention to detail regarding period props, costumes and music.  This is all the more impressive when one considers that the story spans over 30 years and each period is rendered with near perfect precision.Marshall coaxes a polished performance out of Drew Barrymore, whose roles are normally confined to significantly lighter fare.  Barrymore breezes through the childhood scenes and gives a fine performance, but as the character ages, she becomes less effective and playing Adam Garcia's mother (Garcia is actually 2 years older than she is) she is barely credible.  Still, this is the most mature performance I've seen from Barrymore and it might be a gateway to more serious dramatic roles.The supporting acting buoys the film and makes Barrymore look that much better.  Brittany Murphy's performance as Fay is superlative, at times overshadowing the star with a vivacious and sincere portrayal of Bev's best girlfriend.   With each role, I am more impressed with the way Murphy throw's herself into her character and pours emotion into the frame.  I actually would have liked to have seen Murphy in the lead role as Bev, her performance was that strong.  Steve Zahn also shines as Bev's hapless husband.  Zahn gives us an endearing character that is as earnest as he is pathetic.  Adam Garcia brings forth a very believable teen Jason, torn between his need to have his own life and a dedication to the mother who torments him.This film has a lot going for it.  The story is compelling, the direction steady and the acting is generally well done.  Marshall may have introduced a bit too much levity considering the difficult challenges of Donofrio's life, but not to the point of trivializing the film.  I rated this film an 8/10.  It will have strong appeal to women, especially single mothers.

It's such a RELIEF to be in the hands of a competent director!  Even a director who's MERELY competent can, under the right circumstances, turn out a masterpiece (e.g. Michael Curtiz, Casablanca).  Each scene in Riding in Cars with Boys, while it may not be inspired, WORKS.And gosh, Drew Barrymore.  From the point of view of audiences, at any rate, it's a good thing for child actresses to attain minor celebrity.  For ANY art, the practitioners who learn it as children are more likely to be good at it than those who learn it later; and indeed, Barrymore is as talented and versatile as anyone of her generation.  Also, child actresses grow up to be the most attractive adult actresses, because nobody could predict their adult appearance at the point at which they became famous, and so the Hollywood process designed to screen out all but the blandest-looking near-anorexics has a chance of missing them.  (To be fair, there are beautiful actresses who manage to get past the screening process by other means.)  ...Anyway, my point is I've never doubted her ability, and here she gives her best performance yet, playing someone who can be sweet, smart, blind, perceptive, articulate, immature, and is always, ALWAYS, the best thing going for the film.Which I didn't, in the final analysis, really like.  Maybe it's just me.  Serious spoilers follow.At the end, Beverly (Barrymore) says to her son (I'm paraphrasing here) Let me get one thing straight.  I don't think that you were what destroyed my life.  You were what saved me.  You were the best thing that happened to me.  This falsehood is so ludicrous that it left me, and surely everyone else watching as well, utterly floored.  Where did it come from?  The characters - Beverly IN PARTICULAR - had hitherto been remarkably honest.  Who would believe such rubbish?  Beverly herself?  Surely not.  Was it a lie intended to convince the son?  It didn't come across as such.  (Although he seemed, for some bizarre reason, convinced.)  Was it intended to fool the audience?  If so, I take it as an insult.The truth, which it would be folly to attempt to deny, is that Jason was the WORST thing that happened to Beverly.  The bulk of the film is a clear-as-glass demonstration of the need for the wide distribution of every kind of contraceptive, and legalised (and subsidised) abortion.  Not just one or the other.  Both.  (I found myself warming towards infanticide, as well, but I suppose it's not just this particular boy who was an insufferable brat at an early age.)  ...I have a wider criticism the Beverly and Jason we see in the 1980s, both their relationship and their separate characters, seem to come from nowhere - certainly not from anything we see in the extended flashbacks to the 1960s.  Everything that happens in the 1980s just feels irrelevant.  The way the 1980s relationship is REVEALED to us is, of course, very clever, and carried off with perfect timing ... so much so that I'm already regretting having said anything unkind about the film at all.  The direction is competent (I cannot stress enough how great a compliment I mean this to be), and Drew Barrymore brings us close to a wonderful character.  But what can I say?  All in all I wasn't persuaded.

Then we see her in her thirties chasing her dream, to be a writer in spite of living on welfare for years. The film is based on an autobiography by the real Beverley Donofrio. 	So the film falls to a usually fatal inherent problem in movies that span generations, it tries to cover too much territory.	Director Penny Marshall (Big, A League Of Their Own, and Awakenings) has also softened the film considerably for my liking, determined to give us a feel good film in spite of the circumstances.	Steve Zahn as the no good father Ray is fun however, as is Brittany Murphy as Fay who probably gives us more oomph for our money than even Drew Barrymore.

(Dir Penny Marshall)Drew Barrymore is an old soul with a kinetic energy that is infallible and addictive.  Her talents are large and she is a force to be reckoned with especially when she's got her game on.  In her latest, a comedy/drama based on a real person's account of their life, she gives one of her best performances to date.As Beverly D'Onofrio, a 15 year old wild child in the rural Connecticut town o Wallingford, Barrymore enfuses this young woman with a life spirit to conquer the world even if she is having trouble getting out of her hometown to become a journalist as her life's ambition.  What curtails that is her knack for getting into trouble with her loving yet strict parents, (Woods and Bracco giving fine turns too), with the odds against her when her dad is on the police force and regularly has her picked up for breaking curfew. Along the interim of her awkward adolescence she winds up getting pregnant by the sweet yet dense Ray (Zahn in an Oscar calibre supporting performance of pathos) who ineptly proposes marriage and a life of ultimate stagnation.Bev watches her fellow friends go on to better things except for her best friend Fay (the equally excellent Murphy proving to be one of the better character actress ingenues of her generation) who is in the same boat as Bev one in the oven and a life that is ultimately getting bleaker by the year.  The two's bond is the only thing keeping their sanity after their parents' initial dismay and distance only solidifies their friendship in sister hood. When Bev finally gives birth to Jason she is faced with the ultimate commitment (to her child) and sacrifice (of her dream) with heartbreak and a constant circle of disappointment largely to Ray's forgetfulness, immaturity and sadly his persuasion into alcoholism and lastly heroin addiction (wisely watered down in this comedy/drama of D'Onofrio's well-received novelization of her young life).  Bev realizes the only way to break away for herself is to have Ray move out of their live and in one of the film's most emotional moments Ray quietly agrees and accepts that his life will never prosper as he bids his young son goodbye. The film is told in flashback and narrated by the young adult Jason (Garcia, who is actually 2 years older than Barrymore!) who has endured his mother's shortcomings and essentially blaming her existence as being held back just because of his very presence.  His patience is on the edge when he has to tell her he is transferring from her wished for education at NYU for a Midwestern state college (unbeknownst to Bev) to hook up with his girlfriend Amelia, Fay's daughter. The film works largely to the acting and directing.  Barrymore runs the gamut of emotions for her character and through the 20 years of onscreen transition accurately depicts a woman from a time who had many obstacles along the way, the least not being herself.  She is ably supported by an excellently conceived cast especially the funny/sad Murphy (her mimicking of Bracco in a mock reaction to Bev's announcement of being pregnant and her wedding celebration toast are both treasures of laughter and poignancy) and Zahn is clearly one of the most talented character actors around who has practically collected a cottage industry of golden hearted nitwits but here his Ray is a man many of us have known (or came close to becoming) and his is the one most fleshed out avoiding pitfalls of being a typecast of a loser/bad husband; he's just another flawed human being. The adorable Arens makes little Jason identifiable also to a generation of broken homed children trying to be a kid but growing up faster than expected. Marshall's direction is right on the money extracting laughs from moments brimming near tears in the difficult balancing act of fine comedy to smart drama with moments of hilarity sprinkled (the aforementioned wedding and for me the biggest laugh was Ray's fighting style for Bev when they first hook up is priceless).  The only thing the film seems to betray the storyline is how neatly things fall into place not unlike a well-produced tv movie-of-the-week (I'm sure there were a lot of trimmings from the warts-and-all tellings in D'Onofrio's book) yet the screenplay by Morgan Upton Ward does allow its characters to both shine and the unexpected occur (Woods in particular by the film's end). A laugh while you cry film that never ceases to amaze in an all-too familiar American story of rags to slight-riches abundant in character, both literal and metaphorical.  "},{"Title":"Slop!","Date":"22 March 2002","Score":"2 out of 5 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Biography, Comedy, Drama","Review":"  Riding in Cars With Boys tells of a 1960's high school girl (Barrymore) who gets pregnant, married, has a baby, etc., etc., etc. A directorial disaster with an awful screenplay and a twenty-something Barrymore in the lead as a 15 year old (yeah, right) girl, this film can't make up it's mind what it wants to be, what it's trying to say, or where it's trying to go save being a possible PSA for unintended pregnancy. And sooooo, it rambles on incessantly with corny jokes, contrived poignant moments, always searching and never finding a reason for us to be watching. I wonder if the producers ever say what the hell were we thinking. Save this one for the boob tube.

Penny Marshall directs this true story based on Beverly D'Onofrio's novel. A young teen (Drew Barrymore)soon becomes a single mother trying to juggle her dreams of becoming a noted writer against the feelings she made one wrong choice after another in her life. Quite comical for such a moody and depressing story line. Super fine atmosphere music from the likes of The Chiffons, Sonny & Cher, The Jelly Beans, Billy Idol, Rare Earth and Everly Brothers. Miss Barrymore is called upon to tough every emotion imaginable and does it well. Also featured in the castLorraine Bracco, Steve Zahn, James Woods and Adam Garcia.

Uneasy picture spans the years, but never finds an appropriate tone or a convincing sense of nostalgia. It's all laid on so heavily, and the performers have a tough time breaking through the plastic. Drew Barrymore is uneven in the lead, but she has a few triumphant scenes comically trying to throw herself down the stairs to abort her unwanted baby (which made me laugh), in her kitchen with her girlfriend and learning her pal is moving away because the family wants them separated, being interviewed for a scholarship and asking the trustee, I'm not going to get this, am I? Moments like these work well because nothing is being forced; the sentimentality and emotions that come up are directed easily. But too much of the movie is unsubtle, frantic, heavy-handed. And Drew as a 35-year-old with a teenage son, talking with her teeth clinched, is a gambit that simply doesn't work. ** from **** "},{"Title":"Failed To Catch My Imagination","Date":"17 August 2005","Score":"0 out of 4 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Biography, Comedy, Drama","Review":" A strangely titled movie , I mean what did you think this movie was going to be about ? Anyone thinking it was a Michael Jackson bio-pic please leave the room now and don't ever return . RIDING IN CARS WITH BOYS deals with female teen angst and things going wrong that affect the rest of your life No doubt this movie was made with a market for teenage girls and mothers in mind , but it fails to take off . Okay I confess that being a chick flick it's not really my type of movie but even so when you've got James Woods in a supporting role you do have a right to demand better . The fractured storyline of Beverly's life becomes irritating , the revelation of Beverly's  boyfriend  in 1986 is revealed too early but worst of all for such a serious subject there's misplaced humour . I'm thinking mainly of Beverly's deliberate fall down the stairs . This film should have been so much better "}]
