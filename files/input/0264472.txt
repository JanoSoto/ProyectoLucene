[{"Title":"Changing Lanes A turn for Hollywood? (8 stars)","Date":"9 April 2002","Score":"68 out of 84 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama, Thriller","Review":"  When `Changing Lanes' first opens, the viewer is presented with a montage of jagged credits, trendy jerking photography cruising NYC streets, and electronic beats that are so cool they could be used for cryogenic freezing. It quickly seems apparent that this film is simply a star-vehicle for Ben Affleck and Samuel L. Jackson; it seems apparent that this is a cold and impersonal genre-exercise for a successful comedy director, Roger Michell (`Notting Hill'), to branch out; it seems to be all these things until the end of this sequence when the camera glances out the window of a school bus out onto the New York City skyline, and there we see it the World Trade Center. Unlike Sam Raimi's upcoming `Spider-Man', delayed after September 11th so that the WTC could be digitally removed, this is a film unafraid to date itself, and unafraid to look at human truth.Affleck plays the role of the oddly named Gavin Banek (did they take the name &#145;Ben Affleck', throw it in a blender, and add some new letters for good measure?), a high-power lawyer on the verge of becoming one of the partners at his law firm, alongside his father-in-law. Jackson is Doyle Gibson, a reforming alcoholic father of two clawing his way out of his hole and trying to save his marriage. On a critical day in both their lives, Doyle going to court to try winning joint-custody, and Gavin on his way to seal his career-making case, the two get into a minor accident on the FDR turnpike, causing Doyle to miss his hearing and Gavin to accidentally give Doyle a signed document that is critical to his case&#133; and it all unravels from there.The two tumble in a daylong haze of malice and self-destruction, sabotaging each other's lives. Whenever either decides to throw in the towel and do the &#145;right' thing, it is too late and the other has already escalated it to the next level. His life quickly falling down around him, Gavin begins to examine it for the first time, taking a deep look into his wife, his law firm, his boss/father-in-law, and himself&#133; ultimately questioning his motivation for trying to retrieve the document in the first place.This is where the film really shines many movies ask the question &#145;what makes a man?' but `Changing Lanes' does it with honestly and authenticity. The screenplay, by Chap Taylor, asks if it is success, or if its providing for one's wife and kids, or if its true goodness, avoiding superficiality and delving into the motivations for each. In one telling monologue, Gavin's father-in-law, played with perfect tone by Sydney Pollack, says, `At the end of the day, I do more good than harm. What other standard have I got?' Unfortunately, the movie does not really ask the question of what makes a woman, even though both wives show real strength. The movie does not even seem to suggest that Gavin and Doyle's struggles could even be applied to women (obviously they could, had the movie explored that).Jackson, always an excellent actor, is great as Gibson even if he has performed better before. Surprisingly, in this film Affleck's acting actually seems to surpass Jackson's in this amazing performance that is probably the best we have seen from Affleck so far.All of the characters in the film, including minor-roles and extras, all exhibit a very human feel, and seeing real-feeling people on the screen has always been something rare and not to be taken for granted. The viewer comes to care about everyone in the picture Gavin, Doyle, their wives, the guy at the bank, even the stranger at the bar.New York City itself is alive in this movie it breathes, coughs, and gasps with Salvatore Totino's shaky, unsaturated, claustrophobic photography. Totino really looks at people and the city in the face, and does not try to make them prettier or uglier than they are. David Arnold's original electronic score is a refreshing change from the very poor attempts at orchestral music that most movies are now filled with. Arnold's score very effectively sets the mood and reinforces the tempo of the movie.`Changing Lanes' is a success for Roger Michell that shows us that a movie can have major stars, be entertaining, glossy, substantial, and pensive all-at-once.`Changing Lanes' is rated R for a fender-bender, destruction of office equipment, unseen infidelity, a shot of the World Trade Center, and honest depiction of the human condition.

The most obvious is probably that the characters develop before, during, and after the presented story, as the film opens at a critical time for both of them and closes with them having changed major parts in their lives.I expected this to be a glorified version of Madd's Spy vs. Spy, or something of that nature, given the hype. However, it is not at the same pace at all... the violence is not cartoonish, its realistic. The characters are not simple, they are complex. They have issues and are both trying to find a better sense of balance in their lives, both do things which they regret... all in all, this is one of the most human movies I've ever watched.Even though the characters are deep, the movie does not try to emphasis it with drawn out scenes with dramatic music or anything, which actually makes it more like watching real people than watching a movie. It also makes for a more powerful effect overall because it is up to the watcher to notice the subtleties.The acting and directing are very well done, and there is some writing which surprised me in that it showed more about the characters rather than relating directly to the main conflict (I don't want to give too much detail and spoil it). The pacing is good and kept me interested throughout, partially to see what the main characters would do next and partially to see what, if anything, they would learn from the experience.It is not as epic as something like Shawshank Redeption, and doesn't deal with esoteric themes such as Meet Joe Black or ominous themes such as Equilibirum or 1984(the novel), but in a way it is more epic because it deals with normal people who struggle to be beneficial humans despite major mistakes, pressures, and conflicts.

Jackson having a minor accident on the freeway. Both are late for important appointments and Affleck makes the dire mistake of leaving Jackson stranded and accidentally leaving a hugely important document at the scene. Soon it is apparent that Jackson's tardiness to a court hearing was devastating as it becomes clear that wife Kim Staunton and their two young children are going to move west to get away from Jackson for good. Affleck's lost document creates a frenzied search to find Jackson and get the papers back, but we all know it is not going to be that easy. A wild and crazed cat and mouse game then starts as the road rage flows over into both men's lives. Now each are in a contest to destroy the other one before their enemy gets the chance. Fast-moving and quick-minded, Changing Lanes kept me interested until a somewhat contrived ending that really seemed to not fit in with the rest of the picture. Affleck and Jackson are both pretty good here and the supporting cast is strong enough to keep the momentum of the two leads moving. Not the best film ever made by a long-shot, but still not a bad little ride. Just be sure your ride does not hinder those around you. 4 stars out of 5.

From the preview, you'd think it is an action fan's over-revved, simple-minded revenge thriller with lots of vehicular mayhem. Believe it or not, it does more peeling back of the layers of insulation of the affluent/powerful end of the social spectrum than any film I have seen lately. (--And not in the way the disappointingly too-pat-to-downright-absurd 'John Q' did, either.)It's a film noir, and one of the darkest at that, full of despair, cynicism and scathing revelations about human nature. It seems to say-- or really, and this is a major distinction, to be about characters some of whom believe-- that we all make deals of personal expedience with Morality, that no one escapes life formation uncompromised and therefore able to comment on or judge anyone else's choices or actions. It's the old amoral, nihilistic/relativistic universe routine, which says concepts of fairness, justice or morality are quaintly irrelevant, that stuff just keeps happening, always has and always will, que sera sera.My favorite scene, which was revolting and ugly and creepy as anything in any horror film you can name, is when Affleck sits down in a fine restaurant to discuss with his wife the morality of the situation he has been sucked into and is getting in deeper by the hour. He recognizes rightly that his game of oneupmanship, and win-at-any-cost has gotten insanely out of control. He is beginning to question it all, everything in his life. He comes to his wife for solace, direction, insight, a hint of moral rectitude, any help she can offer. She helps him, alright-- by saying she knows he does dishonest things (like having an affair with a woman at the office, which up until she springs that, he thought was his little secret) and that she could have had an honest husband, if that was all she wanted. --Why would she make a scene over an infidelity and risk interrupting the flow of her resources, anyway, she asks. He splits the dinner, dazed and even more desperate. In the next scene we witness him doing more of those very things he has just been having moral anguish over. (Maybe he can't recognize the feel of moral anguish at first.)The Affleck character has a tremendous amount at stake, courtesy a pretty nifty plot hook, that keeps him up to some very dirty tricks. Sure, he doesn't want to risk interrupting the flow of his resources, either. But I think it's clear that the real reason he keeps doing crummy things is because he is a man compulsively drawn to the rewards of a destructive mode of behavior. Others gamble or drink or eat too much. Affleck works the system, lying, cheating, and treating all people like garbage. That's his high, his inescapable need. He can't quit. (Late in the film, he agrees to hire an idealistic young intern because, he laughs uncontrollably to himself, he wants to see what the intern's optimism and altruism looks like after 5 years of hard weathering by his no-rules-in-life employer.) Affleck is sick, and while he finally recognizes that sickness, he resigns himself to keep doing the same thing because, as his boss tells himself, he is willing to believe he has done more good than harm at the end of the day. The Affleck character's motivations for being extra bad, in the episode of his life we glimpse here, are strong enough to keep Changing Lanes from being just another American psycho study; it's easy to believe we could turn Affleck, given a similar circumstance in our life.The ending is a somewhat forced positive one, but not nearly as much a sell out as is usually the case with a made-by-committee major commercial film. I give the whole enterprise 8.5 out of 10 stars.

First of all, it's real.  Not an artificial Hollywood shoot 'em up or disaster flick.  This is a film about the human struggle. There's no violence or sex, and if it weren't for about 7 uses of the f word Changing Lanes could've easily earned a PG-13.  So don't let the R-rating fool you.There are three main reasons why I checked out this movie  Samuel, L, Jackson.  Needless to say, he's a terrific actor and worth seeing in whatever he does.  He's one of my favorites, and he delivers another powerhouse performance, taking on a role somewhat different from his recent roles  he plays an average Joe.  We're introduced to his character, Doyle Gibson, who's a very nice guy simply haunted by mistakes in his past, one being alcoholism, which led to a divorce.  And now he's attending AA meetings and buying a house for his two kids, hoping he will attain custody of them.  Ben Affleck is good and charismatic.  I didn't sympathize as much with his character, but that doesn't make him an antagonist.  Neither characters are saints, nor are they sinners.  That's good, because it's never completely effective to include characters who are entirely sympathetic.  They're both mature adults, but they resort to juvenile acts of revenge in hopes that they can undo what happened.  Sydney Pollack is great, as Affleck's egotistical father-in-law, proving his talents in front of the camera are just as fine as his talents behind the camera.  I wanted to see more of the beautiful Amanda Peet, but she only has approximately 7 minutes of screen time.  So I'm guessing that topless scene I heard mentioned didn't make it to the final cut.  Oh, well.  William Hurt, who seems to do a movie every 5 years, unfortunately has a small, thankless role as an alcohol counselor.The script is well-written, and the film is a lot more character-driven than ones of recent years.  I loved that scene in the bar where Sam Jackson sits in a lonely bar, listening in on two white guys badmouthing Tiger Woods. He lashes back with a terrific monologue, and later ends up punching them out. Some directors would've cut that scene out, overly concerned about the film's pacing, but I'm glad this time that wasn't the case.  However, the ending seems a little fake.  It's just too happy for its own good.  But that's the only element of the movie I found forced.My score  7 (out of 10) "},{"Title":"A commercial film that's actually subtle","Date":"15 April 2002","Score":"29 out of 37 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama, Thriller","Review":" I imagined this was going to be one film from the previews I'd seen, but in reality it turned out to be another - a far more subtle experience than I had expected. A lot of the people in the packed theatre where I saw it apparently expected that other film too; they seemed disappointed when they'd left - they'd probably been expecting yer basic escalating violence, with us cheering for Jackson as the good guy and Affleck as the bad. Not a black and white movie (no pun intended), more of a karma sort of thing, with the two main characters learning from each other in ways they never realized they would (or needed to). And heavy-handedness is nowhere to be seen. Kudos for that alone.

The acting and directing is expertly carried out, with special praise to Ben Affleck as Gavin Banek. Changing Lanes actually explores more depth into the main characters, and how their lives will change, either for better or worse, rather than just dealing with pure and simple 'road rage'.Samuel L. Jackson was well appointed as Doyle Gipson, and portrays his part well. One character's next move to destroy the other makes compelling viewing, and we can actually feel some sympathy for them, as we see both their emotional and compassionate side.The story flows well as we are drawn into Banek and Gipson's desire to cause pain and hurt, not giving any thought to others who maybe affected by what they are doing. Changing Lanes is not a violent film as such, it simply explores the aspects of revenge in what could be a true-to-life measure. This is what makes it an entertaining and gripping movie that proved a winner for myself, and should do for many other film fans.

After the adrenaline-pumping portrait of road rage that the marketing department projected for this movie in its previews, it does fall completely short of expectations.Yet the true Changing Lanes was much more subtle and humanistic than it was meant to be. Street scenes are painted with a damp, dingy gray color. The music is spare, thin, and mostly bleak. The two main protagonists are people who are difficult to like, though Samuel Jackson plays a more sympathetic character, victimized not just by a smug lawyer, but by a history of alcoholism that has resulted in the disintegration of his family and of his life.What I appreciated the most about the series of events in this movie is that manifested rage that this movie cashed in on turned out to be quite believable. The characters lashed out at one another, but often withdrew into a sort of introspective horror for what they had done. They were motivated to do bad things, but they were not bad people.The ending, perhaps, was a bit too pat, perhaps attempting to assuage viewers who had just sat through 90 minutes of ugliness, but it didn't sit that badly with me, and I enjoyed Affleck's drifting speech about the girl on the beach in the end. This movie wasn't perfect, but it had a consistent style, an appropriately low-key but still edgy soundtrack, and an interesting exploration of two people who were arguably closer to losers than heroes; yet they were interesting due to their flaws.If you've seen the preview for this movie, try to forget you ever saw it and instead enjoy the considerably less glamorous movie that Changing Lanes turned out to be.

The managed to keep my attention from waning, and the ethical questions it raised forced me to do a bit of thinking.I might not be a strict enough movie critic, since I tend to forgive--overlook, even--a number of flaws, as long as they do not outweigh the good sides of a film. So yes, it does have a few rather unconvincing bits ***POSSIBLE SPOILER ALERT*** (first and foremost, I can't see why go and bankrupt somebody after only one attempt at, uhm, reconciliation) ***END OF SPOILER***, but if you disregard them, suspending your disbelief for a while, you can really enjoy the movie. It grips you, even though the action doesn't rush at a breakneck speed; and thank goodness that it doesn't, because that is why the movie stands out from the crowd. (As for those IMDb posters who considered that boring it wasn't. I'm really sorry for you guys, if you really need to be bombarded with adrenaline to enjoy a film.) Changing Lanes is a personal-vendetta thriller with a difference instead of a steady escalation of anger and violence, constantly augmented by the revengeful side of man's nature--as is usually the case in I-hold-a-grudge-against-you-and-vice-versa movies--we see it moderated now and again by the other, more human side of these two guys, neither of whom is really wicked or degenerated. This is where what I see as the strength of this film lies--and what some other posters considered the source of implausibility the apparent inconsistency of the actions the two protagonists take. True, they are inconsistent, but it is because there are two strong, contradictory forces at play. Even if the movie exaggerates things a little, it still gets my respect for avoiding one-sidedness. We human beings are, as a matter of fact, pretty erratic creatures, says the movie. And given the right circumstances, we can be really nasty, too, though we'd never suspect ourselves of that.***POSSIBLE SPOILER ALERT*** And the ending? Sure, so things might have ended, well, more grimly. But does it really spoil the movie that much? I'd say, rather, that it simply rounds up the whole idea of the film, which is not utterly pessimistic, and definitely isn't judgmental. Granted, in a very good commentary-like scene towards the end, Affleck's character laughs in the rookie lawyer's face when the latter says that men are by nature good; but the film doesn't say we are incurably bad, either, and the ending only adds to that. By the way, I don't think it is all that nice-and-happy and doesn't fit the rest of the picture; the better side of the struggling Affleck, the one which comes out on top, is never really concealed earlier in the movie, while for Jackson things are still rather open-ended--though I've got to say that he deserved at least that much. ***END OF SPOILER***The acting is really fine and convincing, the photography interesting, the soundtrack doesn't particularly stun, but doesn't irritate, either. My recommendation do see this film if you have a chance. 7/10.

But a mislaid file rapidly leads to a vicious escalation of alternating retribution in scenes reminiscent of The War Of The Roses. British director Roger Mitchell (Notting Hill) uses some edgy camerawork and rapid cutting to pile on the tension but, just when he should be pushing his characters to breaking point, the whole thing collapses into a most unsatisfactory ending of unconvincing decency. Along the way, Sydney Pollack, who has himself directed a movie exposing the hypocrisy of the legal profession (The Firm), is on the mark as the head of the law firm and the father-in-law of Affleck's character, but first-rate actors like William Hurt and Toni Collette are only given bit roles. The whole thing could, and should, have been so much better and the main fault has to lie with the last quarter of the script.

Neither driver is injured, and neither car sustains serious damage. Yet this seemingly-trivial happening sets in motion a chain of events that will lead to both men committing several crimes, up to and including attempted murder.The two drivers are, by coincidence, both on their way to Court hearings. One is Gavin Banek, an ambitious young lawyer with a top New York law firm, who is acting in an important case involving the administration of a charity set up under the will of one of the firm's clients. The other is Doyle Gipson, a divorced father on his way to a hearing concerning the custody of his two sons. As a result of the collision, Gipson arrives late for the hearing only to find that the judge, impatient with waiting for him, has awarded custody to his ex-wife, meaning that she is now free to take them to Oregon where she intends to live.Things also go badly for Banek at his hearing. Upon arrival at Court he finds that he is missing a vital document and realises that he must have accidentally left it with Gipson while the two were exchanging names and addresses. The judge gives him until the end of the day to file the document with the Court. When Banek traces Gipson, however, and asks him to return the document, Gipson, still angry about the collision and about the outcome of his own court case, refuses. Banek thereupon hires a computer expert to hack into Gipson's computer records and tamper with his credit record, effectively making him bankrupt. He then contacts Gipson again, informs him what he has done, and tells him that he will restore Gipson's credit rating in exchange for the missing document. This leads, in effect, to a declaration of all-out war between the two, each trying to outdo the other in bad behaviour, culminating in Gipson trying to kill Banek by sabotaging his car.This film might have been better if it had been made as a black comedy, but the film-makers chose instead to make it as a serious human drama. James Berardinelli described it as a statement of how external influences can cause an otherwise decent human being to do things that are despicable. It does not really work as such, largely because the two protagonists (and most of the other characters as well) are so unlikeable. Despite his attempt to kill Banek, we can perhaps regard Samuel L. Jackson's Gipson as being as much sinned against as sinning. He is, after all, subject to severe provocation, not only from Banek, but also from his ex-wife Valerie and from a bureaucratic court system that seems unwilling to make allowances in his favour, and he does have at least one redeeming characteristic in that he is a devoted father to his sons. It must be said, however, that many of his problems are self-inflicted. (He is, for example, a recovering alcoholic, and it was his drinking, and drink-fuelled violence, which led to the breakdown of his marriage). Perhaps the best evaluation of his character comes from his Alcoholics Anonymous sponsor You know, booze isn't really your drug of choice anyway. You're addicted to chaos.It is, however, more difficult to regard Ben Affleck's Banek as an otherwise decent human being. Banek works for the sort of law firm which has, to say the very least, a relaxed attitude to legal ethics. Although he is not mired in outright criminality quite as deeply as some of his colleagues, especially the senior partner Stephen Delano, who also happens to be his wife's father, Banek's moral standards are nevertheless low. In an attempt at self-justification Delano asks rhetorically At the end of the day, I do more good than harm. What other standard have I got? This self-assessment, however, is not borne out by the plot; the film shows us a good deal of the harm that Delano has done and no evidence that he has ever done any good. Apart from a contrived and implausible ending, there is no evidence that Banek has ever done any more good than his father-in-law. When Banek is forced to confess to his colleagues that the vital document has gone missing, Delano's solution is to manufacture a replacement by combining the donor's signature from another document with a photocopy. Banek objects to such forgery on ethical grounds, even though his own behaviour towards Gipson is just as illegal and could be regarded as even more immoral.Affleck seems to have a talent for picking the wrong films (see also Reindeer Games, Pearl Harbor, 200 Cigarettes and several others). If he adds any more to his collection of turkeys he will be able to corner the Christmas market. Although it garnered some critical acclaim, for me Changing Lanes falls firmly in the turkey category. It struck me less as a study of two otherwise decent men under pressure than an entirely predictable account of what might happen when an alcoholic chaos addict meets a shyster lawyer. The result is neither edifying nor enlightening. 4/10 "},{"Title":"A Great Movie with a Moralist End","Date":"14 July 2003","Score":"5 out of 8 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama, Thriller","Review":" Gavin Banek (Ben Affleck) is a lawyer in a hurry to the court that hits the car of Doyle Gipson (Samuel L.

But he forgets his power of attorney in the scene of accident. Gavin is defending his company against the inheritor of a foundation, who claims that he deceived her grandfather to get the power of attorney and administrate the millions of dollars of the foundation.

From this point on, Gavin will start a war against Doyle, trying to retrieve his document. The rage between them will increase along the plot. This movie is great, although the moralist end of the story does not fit to the profile of the character of Ben Affleck. The acting of the cast and the direction are sharp and keep the attention of the viewer.

More realistically, they would have filed a motion with a certified copy of the document, and later file the original if necessary. That Gavin, knowing the document was irreplaceable nonetheless brings it out of the car to be inadvertently dropped is also quite silly. The other nonsense is that Gavin had to be on time at the hearing, or else, even after suffering the traffic accident. Having Gavin do other things on such a precarious day, like interview job candidates, makes no sense. That Gavin is one of the partners son-in-law further piles on the absurdity.Meanwhile, Doyle Gibson, while no lawyer, does some very stupid things of his own, like not cashing on the opportunity and picking up a computer in a bank and throwing it down to the floor (with no consequences). Later Gavin very tensely confronts the same officer, who seemingly not having learned his lesson, continues to behave like a jerk. I was expecting Gavin to throw down to the floor his newly installed computer too.Then we have Master Hacker, who can with just a name enter a man's banking and credit accounts and delete them all and declare him bankrupt, and later undo all these things, all in just minutes. He is a useful, convenient but totally unreal device. Why use him instead of hiring some goons to force Doyle to return the document, well, I guess the reason was that Gavin did not know any goons, only Master Hacker.Gavin gets panicky and activates the sprinklers in the office in order to access a file. Water flows in buckets for minutes while people are forced to evacuate and firemen rush in. Gavin returns later in the evening and the office seems OK, no signs of the deluge. Hell, even one of the interview boys is still around.Why then the 5 stars you may ask? The film seemed good intended. And contrary to others, I liked the denouement. A lot.

I came across this film on pay per view channel and thought it looked an interesting and ominous type of film work. The film revolves around the main two characters, Gavin Banek and Doyle Gypson. The movie opens with Doyle and Gavin both in rush to get to a court date ( totally separate events ) and they are both involved in minor car crash, in which Gavin gives Doyle file of importance by mistake when they exchange numbers... As the film goes on its based around human relationships and on the premise of what people will do to get what they want back and how low they will sink. I personally love films that explore humanity, or lack of it... There goes my review, not going to over go in to it and spoil the twists and turns, but the slimy gavin character sure does pack a punch in a metaphoric sense...and you'll be gasping with disbelief in a couple of parts of how low he does sink and slide.. well happy viewing and hope you like it. Admitedly its not for a action film fan, or someone who wants to sit and be entertained by copious amounts of violence and sex, but if you're in to a film about people and relationships, people's conscience and greed then this is a film for you!!!

Jackson's point of view are about meeting the standard, not having that next drink, showing his family he is worth having back.The choices for Ben Affleck revolve around ethics, partnership, revenge and the Manhattan moral world that requires things done because they must be done. He's a lawyer, but had this film been shot more recently, he surely would have worked for a securities trading firm.The pair collides---on the FDR---and the test, gripping, paced, pressured from both sides, begins.It's not a car chase, but rather an emotional ride that reveals levels the film doesn't seem to outwardly promise.

For escapism value I would rate it highly. I usually cant stand films that are utterly unrealistic but this one has an edge to it. A more menacing undertone than a lot of films of the genre. The two protagonists, Jackson and Affleck, wage a day long war against each other after Jackson mistakenly ends up with a crucial law file that could jeopardise the career and freedom of Affleck's character. Throughout the film, we are confronted with characters who seem to reflect perhaps the strongest urge in western societies today I DON'T GIVE A DAMN. Even if my career, my life, my driving even, are impinged upon in a slight way, all hell can break loose. Even though I've only spent a few months living in the US before, you do get a sense of claustrophobia in the big cities, and this is very apparent throughout this piece. The constant seething of the city, people everywhere. It seems to feed into the paranoia and violence of Jackson in particular.However, in making these points, it makes me wonder why American film producers are so keen on producing an often violent and disturbing picture of big city life when in fact a much more subtle use of threat and force could produce a better film. For example when Jackson loosens the wheel of Affleck's Mercedes and almost causes a fatal smash, only a few scenes later we see something of a reproachment. The guy tried to kill him and now they're friends???!! The violence in it is obviously (and worryingly) desired by American audiences but most of it is so unnecessary. Even for a fictionalised film.Still though, its the type of film that can rarely bore, save for the disappointing ending, which most seem to agree on in this forum. The ding dong battle of wills and the malevolent third parties who gnaw away at Affleck's character in particular make for some interesting viewing which harks back to my original point about 'survival of the fittest' and 'I dont give a damn' mentality prevalent in US and other western societies these days. I like the way also we get glimpses of the World Trade Centre and a pre-911 New York, good to see that the producers and director werent afraid of perhaps showing the film's age.

The film is actually about two men whose lives are thrown into collisions and as a result each man undergoes a moral conversion. One can almost say. a religious conversion in the case of the one character(Ben A.), since he goes through the process of reconciliation, from examination of conscience to confession(involving as part of the symbolism) a real priest and restitution  and personal reconciliation with the other character. The other character(Samuel  J.) gets a whole new look at his own personality and the underlying basis of his alcoholism.

One has pretty much what anyone would ever want and the other one is struggling to keep the little he has not yet lost, his children. After a car accident, they have control on each other's life, playing dangerously with what is more precious to them.The story simply states that if things would've been done right from the beginning, a lot of problems could have been avoided. Instead, as the film goes on, they feel pushed to doing some serious harm in order to get back what belongs to each one. It's in the middle of this open war that both characters begin to realize that perhaps they don't deserve (or want) the elements of their life they're defending a job for one of them; a family for the other. This movie reminded me a lot of Michael Douglas' Falling Down, in which the character also feels pushed over the edge to make things go right.Samuel L. Jackson and Ben Affleck are both good actors and their performances in Changing Lanes are not disappointing at all. I said it before and I say it again Affleck is better off in a supporting role; this movie proves my theory.

His wife (Amanda Peet) understands and accepts that. In the other we have a recovering alcoholic father (Sam Jackson) who is also battling to keep his wife and 2 sons from moving to Oregon, trying to secure a loan to buy his very first house, so they can have a home and stay in NYC, and perhaps become a family again.As both protagonists are on the freeway into the city, the lawyer changes lanes into the father, causing an accident that also disables the other car. Late for a very important court date, the lawyer gives a signed blank check and says I've got to go, here this will take care of everything. Better luck next time. Well, this causes the father to be late for his court appointment for a custody hearing, and he thinks his sons are headed for Oregon.All this sets up great possibilities that the writer and director end up fumbling, for the most part. The lawyer forgets the critical file, a signed power of attorney from a deceased client that would give his firm $$millions in management fees of a non-profit fund. The two protagonists take turns causing the other much grief. In the end the father gets his loan, we see signs that he will become a better man and his family will be re-united. And, the lawyer recovers the original power of attorney, after the firm filed a forged one, and holds that over them to return the ill-begotten $$millions. Basically internal blackmail. So, is he a better person, or does he just get revenge? A pretty good, and interesting, film, but could have been so much more.

After leaving the theater, you will want to take a serious look at your own life and ask the question Am I a good person?  Really?  But not to worry.  It also has the thrill of seeing Samuel L Jackson go ballistic (and who does it better?) and Ben Affleck *finally* plays a character who deserves to be socked in the nose as much as any right-thinking heterosexual male wants to sock Ben Affleck in the nose.The plot of the film is thus  down-on-his-luck insurance salesman Doyle Gipson (Jackson) and self-centered yuppie lawyer Gavin Banek (Affleck) crash into each other while both are on the way to court.  Doyle wants to do the right thing by exchanging insurance information, but Gavin just says I'm in a hurry.  Better luck next time,  and dashes off.  Big mistake.  Anyone who has ever seen Pulp Fiction, Shaft, or A Time to Kill knows you should never make a character played by Samuel L. Jackson mad.  Ever.  Under any circumstances.  As it happens, Gavin leaves an important document behind at the scene and Doyle picks it up.  When Jackson arrives at the courthouse, he loses visitation rights to visit his children because he was unavoidably late.  And when Affleck arrives in court, he is embarrassed because he doesn't have the document.And so it begins.  Gavin needs his document back, but Doyle is in no mood to give it to him.  So Gavin hires a computer hacker to ruin Doyle's credit so he can't buy the house he hopes to move his kids into.  And then. . .well, you'll have to see the movie to see just how far out of control things get.But beyond the war with each other, each man is at war with his own conscience and with the people closest to him.  Doyle is certain that he is right because he wanted to do the right thing at first, and that this ultimately comes down to his children.  But his ex-wife (why didn't I know who Kim Staunton was before now?), and his AA sponsor (William Hurt) tell him repeatedly that his own rage is the real problem, not Gavin.  Gavin feels bad about what he does to Doyle, but he doesn't see any way out if he wants to keep his position.  And the people who surround him at New York's Sleaziest Law Firm--his boss (Sydney Pollack), his ex-mistress (Toni Collette), and his wife (Amanda Peet)--insist he is a good person because he is a partner in a firm that gives money to children's charities and is opposed to the death penalty.  Plus, he makes lots of money for them.In the transition between the second and third acts, there are a lot of images of churches, praying, paintings of Jesus, and crosses.  I think director Roger Michell and writer Chap Taylor are saying that with the waning of Christianity as the primary factor in people's lives, we've lost our moral compass and let too much other stuff cloud the issue of right and wrong.  It makes the point, but doesn't sermonize.The acting is uniformly great.  Every actor I have mentioned so far in this review is deserving of an Oscar nomination for this film (but it was a spring release and the film wasn't a blockbuster, so fat chance).  And for the first time in eight years, Jackson wears a wig that looks like something that might actually grow from a human head (those of us who have seen The Red Violin know Jackson's real hair is nowhere near that thick or dark).The film does stretch credibility with the war of attrition and the fact that Gavin waits until he is almost thirty to ask himself if he is a good person (most of us started asking ourselves that at a much earlier age).But still, this is one of the most thoughtful movies I have seen in years, and certainly the best film of 2002 I have seen thus far (I haven't seen Minority Report, Insomnia or Road to Perdition yet, but I hope to soon).  9 out of 10 "},{"Title":"A Hollywood film about moral ambiguity!","Date":"14 July 2002","Score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama, Thriller","Review":"  A rare mainstream Hollywood film about Moral Ambiguity - how rare, but refreshing.

Though the film is not without it's extreme bits of behavior & action that aren't entirely credible (Ben Affleck's character literally goes straight from Catholic confessional into his most heinously immoral act in the entire story. Jackson's racial confrontation in the bar seems forced into the story arc.), CHANGING LANES is to be applauded for not taking the easy way out - I.E. Not deciding which of the two characters is 100% in the Right and proceeding from there. Only at the end, with it's somewhat simplistic and pat conclusion does the film lack some nerve (its not fatal however - and maybe I'm just too cynical myself to fully buy it). How rare for a film of this moral depth to go on to be a box office success (hopefully the studio heads noticed). Also, since the film's release it's quite amazing how the unscrupulous behavior of the lawyers (and the implied background of the Foundation benefactor) fits right into the Corporate Scandal headlines of today!

If one can get past the overly schematic script then this film works fairly well as a modern day story of deceit, greed and ultimately (although not very convincingly) of redemption.Director Roger Michell, whose last project was the entertaining romantic comedy NOTTING HILL, does a complete turn-around here, giving the viewer a harsh, overcast look to the city (albeit effectively photographed by Salvatore Totino) and keeping the audience fully involved for the nearly hour and forty minute running time. Ben Affleck gives his best performance hands down, eschewing the simpering mannerisms that marred his performance in PEARL HARBOR. His Gavin Banek (who thinks up these names?!) is a real person, both attractive and vulnerable, and watching Affleck with all his human foibles encountering each situation is a revelation; this movie puts him on the map as a first class film actor. Samuel L. Jackson matches Affleck every step of the way as Doyle Gibson, a much beleaguered man just barely coping with the quandaries he finds himself in. Mention must also be made of Tony Collette, a remarkable young actress (THE SIXTH SENSE) who plays a co- worker in Affleck's law firm; she is virtually unrecognizable from role to role ,a chameleon-like ability that should ensure great character parts in the future. Rounding out the cast is director/sometimes actor Sydney Pollack,superb as Affleck's unscrupulous, tough as nails father-in -law.

Jackson at one point ends up at a bar after the accident, orders a drink, but only contemplates drinking it as it stares him in the face.

The real reason why I dug this movie is because it's real. It's not filled with with typical Hollywood bulls*** and killings. Believe it or not, this movie has no killings. Sorry if I'm spoiling it a bit, but I had to throw that in. A dark dramatic tale of a nobody and a somebody. You can make your own opinion on who is who, after the movie you'll realize that they're both pretty much the same in one way or another.We have Ben Affleck (Dogma, Pearl Harbor) and Samuel L. Jackson (Pulp Fiction, Unbreakable, Shaft) a raging alcoholic trying to save himself and his family (Jackson) and Affleck, a newbie lawyer who is getting a real taste of justice and fraud from the inside of his own office and from his partners. The movie circles around a one day's event. What an event that is. Could it happen in real life? Of course. I don't see why not. It's perfectly normal that this kind of thing could happen to anyone on the street. These two had no reason to meet, but when business is your first priority and manners last, you're bound to get something f***ed up. The whole movie is basically Jackson vs Affleck, Affleck vs Jackson and Affleck vs reality and the truth. The war of threats and withdrawals never seemed longer. Just when you think the movie is about to end, it takes a sharp turn and adds another twist to the story. Tied up between what is right and what should be right, both characters awaken the worst out of both of them. It's one of life's greatest mysteries. The fact that we all have a demon inside of us waiting to be awaken. This movie did just that to both of the characters, and we quickly see how an honest man can turn into something utterly different in a matter of moments.Was the movie dry at all? Surprisingly not one bit. Every scene was crucial to the movie, you couldn't help but keep guessing what will happen next. Was the ending good? Yes and no, more yes than no actually. I myself, was looking for a more dramatic ending, but what I got was semi-dramatic. Still cool though. I was absolutely amazed by Samuel L. Jacksons performance, I've been a long fan of him but this movie showed his true acting skills. He was absolutely amazing. Affleck also did a good job, he's currently spamming the Hollywood with new movie (DareDevil, Sum Of All Fears) all bound to be hit movies. We also have Toni Collette (The Sixth Sense) as Affleck's secretary/lover. A somewhat important character in the film but not the story doesn't circle around her as much as it does around the two main actors. I think there is more to this movie than it's given on the screen. Sure it's a fun movie to watch, but what is really the real massage in it? Don't misuse the power of communication? In a heated moment don't try to rush anything, just take it easy? Whatever it might be, this movie will appeal to everyone who is interested in dramas and thrillers.© 2002 Mirza Causevic mizi "},{"Title":"Where is humanity?","Date":"9 May 2002","Score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama, Thriller","Review":"  I was very excited about going to this movie, thinking it was going to be... action?

Instead, this film shows how the stresses of life that people go through, as well as the morally shaky things that we do everyday, keep adding up over the years, until it   builds a callous around our hearts.  At that point, it's back to every man for himself.  We justify our own selfish and greedy behavior by pointing out that others do it (even if they don't) and try to rationalize actions that would shock us if we observed them in other people.  What's even more amazing is that the film actually stops before going over the top, hollywood-style.  No blown up buildings, or slaughterhouse shooting sprees.  The most chilling scene in the movie, in my opinion, is when the lawyer's wife calmly tells her husband to accept his corrupt lot in life and do what any Wall Street lawyer would do.  One can easily envision her in another time and place telling someone to pull the lever on a gas chamber or incinerator, because, after all, that's the way the world is.The thinking adults on-screen finally come to their senses, allowing thinking adults in the audience to come away with a positive message and ending, and maybe probing some of their own past actions.This is a VERY good film, with excellent performances!

The characters behave like complete morons, and find themselves in the most unlikely and unrealistic of situations.  As the plot becomes more and more absurd, I became increasingly impatient and annoyed.  It's difficult to get involved in a movie when you don't like any of the characters all that much; and in my opinion, both men in this film were unlikable idiots. (Spoilers) Still, there are moments when the audience has no choice but to sympathize with the characters; however, this feeling never sticks because in the end, this is a movie about two hotheaded maniacs who get into a fight and then respond by stooping to the most extreme of tactics (computer credit erasure, sabotage, and much more).  Yes, the concept is good; it's fresh and should be interesting, but yet it's NOT.And I just loved the speech that Gavin's wife gives him in the restaurant.

The film's quick alternation of scenes presents a contrast between two group worlds the well-appointed, spacious court of the elite, run for the participants' convenience, versus the crowded shirtsleeves hearings for the rest of us; the office of rows of computers and phones that is the work world for good folks versus the suite of over-appointed offices holding incriminating files where the lawyers work; the small car that dies at the first sign of trouble vs. the luxury import whose air bag saves a life in a high speed accident. You get the idea who gets pinned to the ground by school safety patrolmen and who gets away with perjury? The  black mother is unremittingly sympathetic, albeit a tad hasty at the custody hearing; the childless rich white wife intentionally chooses and justifies a life built on wronging others. The characters near the margins of this divide are allowed to be veer somewhat from good to evil. Black, working stiff but male -- mostly very sympathetic, but prone to outbursts. White male but recovering alcoholic -- friendly, some good advice, but one act of superior moral condescension which AA would frown on. The good people are victims, victimization is good but should be compensated.Since there really are two stark worlds in NYC, though one isn't good and the other evil, this film is visually entertaining if bankrupt morally and intellectually.The second film is a vendetta of escalating violence between two men. This is entertaining if full of holes. The single most extreme act is unbelievable, out-of-character and, as a premeditated attempted murder, completely off the plot line. This is the action film -- car crashes, wrestling, fights, arrests, terrorized bystanders. The natural symmetry of a vendetta film wars with the PC moralism of the first film.The third film focuses on the redemption offered by conscious ethical control and responsibility from the ravages of impulse, anger, and short-sighted self-concern. Before, beside, and after their vendetta, the protagonists must fight with themselves to avoid the nasty, poor, solitary, brutish and short life derived from following their natures and instead take control in order to pursuit the well-being of others. What gives the vendetta a complexity is its embedding in this ethos, but the complexity in turn vitiates the vendetta, and the ending -- bringing in the first film -- makes an unbelievable hash of the redemptive message.So the complexity is purchased at the price of coherence and sense.Acting does count. Jackson makes his character sympathetic -- but not too sympathetic, since you believe he is capable of outrageous behavior. Affleck is neither charming nor weighty, so we don't care about his character and don't believe his redemptive solution. Hurt as a friend is both caring and removed.There is something to be said for relying on writers to create a satisfying script.

No, I'm not ashamed to use the word, says the character Johnny Caspar in the opening scene of the Coen brothers' 1990 masterpiece Miller's Crossing. That speech would have been a fitting opening to Changing Lanes.  The true test of character may be what a person does under duress The person can a) choose to do that which serves his own interests or b) do what's the best for the overall good of everyone involved. This is the moral decision Gavin Banek (Ben Affleck) is faced with when his car collides with Doyle Gibson's (Samuel L. Jackson) on a NYC freeway, leaving Gibson stranded with a flat tire. You watch in agony as Banek makes the absolute wrong choice. In a coincidence only Hollywood could make, both men are headed to the same courthouse.  Banek doesn't know this, but refuses to give Gibson a ride after Gibson refuses to take a blank check. You sit there and judge Mr. Banek &#145;what kind of inhuman slug would do such a thing.' Yet the scene also plants a seed of doubt in your mind. The moment is so familiar, it's scary. Banek leaves a crucially important file behind while the two are arguing, a power of attorney agreement proving his law firm's control over a dead millionaire's estate. When we make the wrong choice, there's always that one thing that lets us know it. Had Banek made the correct choice, he likely would not have left the file. The moment exemplifies how all of us (not just in the Big Apple) tend to look out for ourselves, out of fear of being walked over, of being taken advantage of. Better luck next time, says Banek to Gibson and drives off. This commonly-used line carries more weight with it here than it ever has before. One of many great points Changing Lanes makes is that you never know what a person's situation is. Is it really healthy to always look after your own interests when faced with a choice, not knowing the other person's situation? You find yourself jumping into Banek's shoes. What would I do if I were in that situation? The answer truly is, 'no idea,' until such a time comes.This film makes another illustration, that making the wrong decision could be a sign that other things in your life are off course. These moments can be looked upon as tests. What does it say about you as a person, that you would make the wrong choice in a situation like this one? Neither Gibson nor Banek takes any kind of lesson from the incident at first. Both men make foolish decisions instead, initially out of anger. Another great point Violence and anger only spurs more violence and anger. Unless cooler heads prevail, the cycle will never end. Banek and Doyle engage in their own small one-day-long war and it changes both of them forever. The struggle brings out the worst in both men. Or is this who they really are? In Doyle Gibson's case, he has a history of losing his temper, which goes into overdrive on this particular day. Even though he was wronged over and over, he lets his anger get the best of him, making him equally responsible for perpetuating the wrongdoing. Gibson's AA sponsor (William Hurt) speaks the film's most important line near the film's climax (also uttered in part in the trailer). It's the one about everything being held together by a covenant and that Gibson broke the contract in his retaliation. He may as well have been speaking to both combatants at that moment. This covenant includes not stranding the guy you hit on the freeway and leaving the scene of an accident. It's all held together by a covenant. How very, very true that is. Changing Lanes wraps everything up just a little too neatly and as a result takes longer to end than it should (too much exposition).  But if any film deserves the benefit of the doubt, to be forgiven its few mis-steps, it's this one. With this one, 2002 really begins.

This is a solid example of the trailer for the Ben Affleck/Sam Jackson vehicle &#145;Changing Lanes'.  Upon first impression, a tight, vendetta filled thriller seems to emerge from a tale of destiny in NYC. Yet after screening the film, the trailer seems a distant memory as to what exactly transpired on film.      My expectations of this film were relatively low considering Director Roger Michell previously directed &#145;Notting Hill'. Directing romance and an urban dram can be two extremes, yet Michell surprises with the creation of this unexpectedly moralistic tale.     Ben Affleck and Samuel L. Jackson are two strangers whose lives collide in a devastating twist of fate on a gloomy Good Friday. Spanning over the course of one full day, we are teleported directly into the lives of these two men. Although this is not one of Jackson's greatest performances, his portrayal of Doyle Gipson's vulnerability as a newly divorced father is as solid as the script allows it to be.        On his way to the courthouse, he gets blindsided by Gavin Banek; a seemingly spirited young attorney. In an effort to exchange information on car insurance, Banek flees the incident due to a court appearance and leaves the stranger in the rain in desolation without a car. What was marketed as road rage in the trailers is merely a subtle tale about our hurried times. With each meticulous act; no matter how minute, the film displays the dire consequences of abandonment.       Due to the accident, Gipson (Jackson) misses his court appearance causing his life to steer in the path he was dreading. Consequently, hatred ensues as Banek's chance encounter takes a turn for the worse in a cat and mouse game of reluctant reciprocity due to both men wanting something they may not have. Michell uses his time wisely as he familiarizes the audience with motives, character back-story and significant details that will all contribute to the sudden uprising of morality that surges in the film &#150; all within the first act.       As aforementioned, those who expect a thriller will be disappointed. This film is a statement on how our society is stratified and the degree to which two men will attempt to achieve their personal vendettas within different classes. The content is presented on screen in an elegant and unravelling manner that makes us understand that the film is not about obtaining what you once had, but obtaining what you thought you had.     Michell opens the film with a few &#145;speedup' shots of NYC accompanied by some trance like beats that do not prepare the viewer for what they are to expect.  The film sets up the first act by bringing our characters into what it is they think they need.  This in turn leads to a second and third act that might unattract some viewers, but places the film a notch above the rest in terms of cinematic pensiveness.      Without giving too much away, the film forces the viewer to reflect upon the many immoral and illogical acts we have all committed within our lifetime. As we see our characters not embarking on an escalating feud driven by genuine dislike and anger, we capture a full throttle vision of a film based on morality. These characters will resort to &#145;strong-arm' tactics and vile methods of reacquiring and avenging their misfortune, but as common sense seeps into their thinking, their values emerge.       Values dictate their actions in the final act and instead of sitting through a conventional and convoluted climax; we are witnesses to an apparent salvation. Chap Taylor's screenplay presents the audience with a morality tale instead of a Hollywood thriller that delivers an uneven yet metamorphic tale that requires a thorough understanding of the double-meaning of the film's title.Giancarlo's Rating **1/2  "}{"Title":"This One Belongs in the Fast Lane","Date":"16 April 2002","Score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama, Thriller","Review":"  Finally!

I did love the father-son bit between Pollack and Affleck, and the combination of awe, fear, and hatred that seems to pass from the latter to the former.        What distinguishes this movie more than anything else for me is the cutting.  From the cutting of the two accidents, to the parallel conversations (did anybody else notice a pattern of conversations, like Doyle to his wife, cut to Gavin & his boss,  Doyle & his sponsor, cut to Gavin & his lover?), and from the very first images where we go between Doyle speaking in an AA meeting about joy to Gavin speaking at a corporate conference on charity, the film is a great comparison/contrast study.        The acting reflects it, in that these men are equally willing to go to war, and equally hopeful for peace in their lives.  Though they're both faulted men, one unstable and angry, the other slimy and deceptive, they end up seeming more alike than different.  And in that realization comes the resolution of the conflict.      In fact, had the film ended with that scene of the two of them meeting in Gavin's office, that point would have been the one to crystallize, instead of the idea of doing the right thing.  Because this is really a better character study than it is a morality tale.  It's about two guys from opposite ends of the track who set each other off and ultimately help each other get straight.   But it's really all synthesized in the editing -- it's just like what Pietro Scalia said when he got the Oscar for Black Hawk Down.

They all gave me the impression that this was a star driven vehicle with only big names going for it and nothing else.  The story seemed weak, and Ben Affleck's past projects haven't been that rewarding for audiences.  Affleck's previous performance in last year's Pearl Harbor was rather thin and artificial, and gave me the impression that he could not perform as a leading man, or in a supporting role either for that matter.  Changing Lanes is exactly that, a change for Affleck into a dramatic role, that he does almost flawlessly. 	Changing Lanes is certainly has a star studded cast.  Academy Award winner Ben Affleck (Good Will Hunting), Academy Award nominee Samuel L.

Affleck plays Gavin Banek, who accidentally has a collision with Doyle Gibson (Samuel L. Jackson) while rushing to a court case that he is already late for.  Banek is a prestigious lawyer has who recently made partner in his firm.  As we all stereotypically expect his career has been made solely on lies and cheating the system.  Gibson is also late for a court case but of a different nature.  Gibson's case actually involves his life.  He is a recovering alcoholic who is fighting with his recently divorced wife over the custody of his two young sons.  We are shown that he understands the fact that he is not a perfect person and has made some mistakes in life, but is willing to go through any means necessary to be able to have his children in his life.  Both Gibson, and Banek arrive late to their cases, but each judge has a different way of dealing with the situation.  The judge in Banek's case is willing to let mistakes be mistakes, and move on with the case.  However, the judge in Gibson's case has already completed the hearing and is not willing to listen to Gibson's story whatsoever.  Just goes to show you what status will give you.  Just when things couldn't get any worse, Banek reveals that his most important file for the case at hand was left on the FDR Bridge where he had his encounter with Gibson.  Luckily Gibson picked it up, and here is where all the fun begins.  The file is essentially the whole reason for the future events to occur.  Banek needs and wants his file back, while Gibson is reluctant to give it back, because he wants the twenty minutes of his life back that Banek wasted that morning.  Various actions are exchanged as a way to force the other to stop and give him what he wants.This movie has a serious tone, and in the past I know Affleck has not dealt well with drama.  Changing Lanes seems as though Gavin Banek was written specifically for Affleck.  He seems so fitting and so perfect in his role, that he has reassured me that he is a serious actor.  How much in the upper echelon a lawyer may be, Affleck shows us that he is only human, and a rather simple one at that.  The audience is able to relate to the hardships that Banek is going through, as his problems seem simple in the scheme of life.  Banek has a gut check towards the end of the film that any descent human being would have.  This gives us a reason to feel anguish, sorrow, and anger that Banek has gone through, that day, and the rest of his experience as a lawyer for that matter.  Samuel L. Jackson is excellent as usual.  He is an actor to watch very closely.  He very rarely disappoints audiences with his work.  He seemed to fit in perfectly in the role of the single dad struggling for custody of his children.  Gibson is a people's man.  He is a very realistic portrayal of those struggling to get out of the lower class and into the middle class.  Jackson's wonderful charisma sheds light on a semi-dull, and unenergetic character.  Jackson's presence brings the character of Doyle Gibson to life, and allows us to relate to his prolonging struggles.  To my surprise, I found that Amanda Peet can be serious and is a half way descent actor as well.  Her stupid comedic roles in the past have led one to believe that she will forever be typecast as the hot girl everyone wants.  I'm glad someone took a chance and cast her out of type in a small but excellent role.Changing Lanes has re-ignited my faith in Hollywood, and in Ben Affleck for that matter.  The combination of Affleck and Jackson is almost flawless, and came as quite a surprise.  The two seem to feed off of one another, and that makes each character that much more entertaining.  The ability of the writer (Chip Taylor) to give us characters that are real, and characters that we can relate to is a great gift, and a job well done.  The direction that Roger Michell gave his actors also helped lend to the superb outcome.  Changing Lanes is one of Affleck's best performances to date, and is a movie that will go unappreciated for the spectacular film is it.  It ranks right up there with We Were Soldiers as one the best films of the year.  My faith has finally been restored in Hollywood, and I hope that more movies like Changing Lanes will be churned out in the future.Grade A-  "},{"Title":"A solid, thought-provoking thriller that makes you think twice about life (contains spoilers)","Date":"14 April 2002","Score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama, Thriller","Review":"  Fate can be very cruel at times. That's the conflict Gavin Banek (Ben Affleck) and Doyle Gibson (Samuel L. Jackson) share in CHANGING LANES, a great psychological thriller. What began as a small accident on FDR Drive in Manhattan between the two characters escalates into atense battle of wits and nerves as Doyle and Gavin struggle to getwhat they really want to accomplish on that very day, and how they try to mess each other up at the same time. This movie gave me my own conflict who to root for and sympathizewith. At first, Jackson's problems with trying to keep custody of his two children, and how much his life is in deep shambles made me want to keep my utmost feelings for. How Gavin thoughtlessly leftDoyle in the middle of the FDR with his wrecked car left me thefirst impression that Gavin is nothing but a self-processed hotshot that disregards the little guy. But, as the movie continues, Gavin starts to develop a conscience, that probably ruining another man's future won't make things any better. So, my considerations for Gavin ultimately changed.The movie does an expert job representing what both central character thinks, in each of their respective scenes. Jackson is typical great, playing, despite Doyle's uncontrollable fits of rage (you can't really blame the guy for being desperate), a more subtle character than his more popular, foul-mouthed roles like Julius from PULP FICTION, and John Shaft from (obviously) SHAFT. And Affleck, whom I haven't really cared too much for, undertakes a great performance as Gavin.

What really got to me was how it doesn't try to dumb down its plot by adding a trite Hollywood version of how things might play out.  Instead, it makes observations about what happens when we let our emotions run unchecked.The movie teams up Afleck and Jackson as two men who are living out one of the most crucial days of their lives.  They get into an accident on a New York Expressway one morning.  Both are in a rush to get to court.  Gavin Banek (Afleck) has to present an important file proving an ailing billionaire turned over control for a lucrative trust foundation to the senior partners at his Wall Street law firm.  Doyle Gibson (Jackson) needs to get to his custody proceeding so he can show that he bought a house to convince his long-suffering wife to stay in town and not leave for Oregon with his two young sons.  He's a recovering alcoholic who lives by the AA credo and wants to do this the right way, that is, exchanging insurance information.  Banek writes him a blank check instead and refuses him a ride to the courthouse.  Better luck next time, he says as he drives off.Gibson is twenty minutes late for the hearing, which is over when he arrives.  He pleads with the unsympathetic judge, who coolly tells him, If this were my family, I would have made sure to be here on time.  Distraught and raging over his loss, he is cornered by an anxious Banek, who realized after he got to his own proceedings that the file he needed had been left with Gibson by accident.  When Gibson realizes the importance of the file, he faxes him one of the pages with Better luck next time scrawled across it.In his desperation, Banek goes to his former mistress for help, and she supplies him with the name of a guy who can fix things.  Played by Dylan Baker as a man with a cheerful cynicism for his job, he arranges to turn off Gibson's credit to get his attention.  It's like when you put those electric collars on a dog, so they get a shock when they stray outside the yard, he says gleefully.  Banek reluctantly goes along with it, because failing to come up with that file could mean a lawsuit or even jail time.So begins a daylong battle between these two men, who met only by accident and fail to realize the futility of their situation.  The movie skillfully demonstrates their strengths and flaws as basic personality traits that get severely tested as they ascend to each new level of contrition.  Gibson believes in Alcoholics Anonymous, believes in the importance of staying sober.  But his sponsor (William Hurt) feels that alcohol isn't Gibson's real addiction, but chaos.  There's an unspoken covenant not to go berzerk, and you broke it, he tells him.Then there's Banek.  He begins to believe that the dying billionaire may not have understood what he was signing, that maybe it's better that the file remains lost.  His wife (Amanda Peet) is blunt with him she could have married an honest man, but she married a Wall Street attorney instead, and he should act like one.  His father-in-law, the senior partner, is a pragmatist.  How did the billionaire make his money, after all?  Do you think that those factories in Malaysia have day care centers in them? he asks.  Do you want to see the tax incentives he gets from that foundation?Beneath all the moral ambiguity is the simple fact that these two men are locked into a contest they have no hope of winning.  In a lesser movie, one of them would have been held up as the hero and the other the villain, but in this one there are no such distinctions.  By the end of the day both will have committed despicable acts against the other, and if there is suspense it comes from wondering if they will stop before it's too late.  The casting is right for these roles.  Afleck is known for his serio-comic characters (Chasing Amy, Dogma) but here plays it straight, growing more and more disillusioned with each hour.  Jackson is at home in the role of a man whose righteous indignation seethes just beneath his carefully constructed surface.Changing Lanes asks when is it time to simply to let the matter drop.  How far is too far?  One wonders if either of these men will stop long enough to ask themselves that very question.

They all added up to the same principle though, this was a good, enjoyable movie to partake. Affleck is becoming a seasoned actor and Samuel L. Jackson thrives in a role written for his sometime desperate-antic ridden psyche.But more specifically five points stick out to me while attempting to review this movie. Maybe perhaps you agree or disagree with them after seeing the movie yourself or perhaps this will cause you to take in your own viewing of the movie or perhaps leave it for a rental opporunity. Either way, here they are...1. Is this a Social Commentary on a number of things? Society, Hollywood, the profession of Law, family life. Who knows? I do know that this movie did provoke me to think of my own ethics and put me into the popular situation of what would I do? Either way, the characters played realistic roles in a situation we all could relate to in some way. 2. Is Affleck becoming a top notch actor or just going through the motions. So many young, talented actors fall into normalcy in most non-blockbuster roles. This is a good movie, but won't get Ben an Oscar. However, he pulls of a strong performance. 3. Samuel J. Jackson. Could anybody have played this tole any better??? If there is somebody out there, I doubt he's been found. 4. Co-stars? Affleck and Jackson are the only two worth noting in this movie. Collette isn't amazing either way, and frankly, whatever she is doing with her physical appearance...it isn't working. Sorry. 5. Overall thoughts. A smart, thought provoking movie, that while at times drags on and on, it's fast-paced and high intensity ridden plot scheme leave you satisfied and enjoyed. The end is what you want and so the director gives it to you.7 out of 10. Jackson and Affleck form a formidable duo in a strong movie by a promising director.

To find one you must first sift through the Shakespearean remakes, teen oriented tales and just straight out garbage. But the light at the end of the tunnel is 'Changing Lanes'.The film is a weaving of montages of two characters Gavin Banek (played by Ben Affleck) and Doyle Gipson (played by Samuel L. Jackson)and how they are connected by a moment in time. Like many other films a recurring theme in 'Changing Lanes' is good vs. evil. But who is the good guy and who is the bad guy? The roles are constantly changing between Gavin and Doyle as one tries to one-up the other in an attempt to seek either revenge or justice due to an automobile accident. It happens to be Good Friday in the film, Gavin steps into a church during a service at his lowest point in the movie and a crucifix happens to be hanging from the cab driver's rear view mirror that Doyle is riding in prayer is recurring in this movie. Doyle, a recovering alcoholic, and is heard in his AA meeting saying God grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change, the courage to change the things I can, and the wisdom to know the difference. This is the major theme of the entire movie. Some things happen and we have no control over them, but some things we do have control over. And 'Changing Lanes' is the way we handle the things we can control, either in a good way or a bad way, and how this control will impact those around us.Jackson plays a father who is trying desperately to regain his family, which is a refreshing difference from the destructive black man seen on tv and films today. Affleck, who is most noted for his action films such as Pearl Harbor and Armaggeddon, steps into a more emotional and intellectual role and he shines. At the end of the film we are shown that it is one's actions and choices made that determine their worth. A thorough and excellent movie. A must-see.

Did anyone ever do anything to you that was so hurtful or  that got you so mad that you wanted to do whatever you could to get back at them?These are the questions that go through the minds of two disparate New Yorkers, who turn a minor car accident on the West Side Highway into a bitter,day-long feud. Samuel L. Jackson plays Doyle Gibson, an insurance salesman who has recently been separated from his wife and family due to his alcoholism.  Ben Affleck plays Gavin Banek, a scheister lawyer wanna-be, who has been entrusted by his law firm to deliver important documents to court to prevent a lawsuit against the firm. Both men are in a hurry to get to their respective court appearances, when they get into the car accident, but when Banek rushes off, he leaves behind the document that would save his case and his firm.  When Gibson is made late for his own court appearance to fight for the custody of his kids, it drives him into an act of desperation and anger, as he uses the important file to try to get back at the uncaring lawyer who has ruined his life. In return, Banek goes to a slimy hacker to tamper with Gibson's credit rating, putting the home  loan he needs to save his family in jeopardy.Changing Lanes examines the lives of the two guys, who are trying to desperately to hold their lives together, and just as they  are about to make ends meet, they run into each other-quite literally-making matters worse. The movie doesn't have as much to do with the two men fighting against each other, as the two men trying to find a way out of their situations and change their lives. Neither guy is particularly bad, but they both feel they must do whatever they can to save face and save their way of living.If you've seen the commercials or the trailer, you've probably seen the best parts of the movie, and much of the rest involves needless sub-plots and exposition that acts as pure filler. The trailers are a bit deceiving  as they seem to promise an action-packed thriller, but that's just not this movie. The basic formula is that we see a bit of expository dialogue, then one of the guys acts against the other, there's a bit more exposition, he feels bad, but before restitution can be made, the other guy retaliates. There never is the sort of over-the-top one-upmanship that made the recent Panic Room such a great movie.  It also quickly turns into a reenactment of The Firm, as Banek tries to find out the truth behind his firm's unscrupulous practices when it comes to the estate of a dead philanthropist.As far as actors go, I'm a fan of Jackson's, but not so much of Ben Affleck;  as characters, both of them have a hard time winning over the audience.  Just as you begin to despise Affleck's character, he tries to make amends and make up for some of his tactics.  By comparison, Jackson's behavior tends to be erratic and irrational, suddenly flying  into rages as you begin to empathize with him. But other than that, Jackson and Affleck are both given an ideal opportunity to show off how good they are as actors, and in this film, they're both at the top of their game. Ben Affleck is surprisingly good, with the redemption of his character being apropos, considering his own recent personal  problems. To his credit, he turns Banek into the more likable  of the characters over the course of the movie. He consciously tries to resolve the situations as they escalate while Gibson seems rather unrepentant and thus, less sympathetic. What's interesting is that the two men keep passing each other, yet their direct face-to-face interaction in the movie is fairly minimal. It's too bad, since these few moments are some of the film's best.The rest of the cast, which includes Amanda Peet as Banek's wife (and daughter of the big boss) and William Hurt as Gibson's AA sponsor, are unnecessary and easily discarded characters. They could have just as easily been unknowns, hired from a SAG casting call.  The only exception is actor/director, Sydney Pollack, who plays off Affleck beautifully, as his boss/father-in-law. Pollack has always been a class act, and he plays the slimeball trying to justify his own crimes as well as he did in Stanley Kubrick's Eyes Wide Shut.The script, a first screenwriting effort by Chap Taylor, is great, and credit can be given to director  Roger (Notting Hill) Michell for getting such stellar performances out of the two actors, but both of them should also be blamed for the poor pacing.  The movie is very slow and dry, and there is just way too much exposition and drama.  Taylor should have tried to insert a few lighter moments to break up the rather dour mood of the movie. As far as the filmmaking, the entire movie looks grainy and poorly lit with fairly bad cinematography.  Michell uses way too many close-ups, and often, the camera seems as if it was poorly positioned.  There is a clear-cut moral and resolution to the story as both men try to seek out redemption, but in general, the ending is also a bit of an anti-climax.Overall, the premise for Changing Lanes is good, making for an interesting character study, but it gets bogged down in trying to develop the characters far beyond what is needed.  More often than not, the movie tends to drag, and it fails to deliver on the trailer's promise of being an exciting thriller. On the other hand, it does succeed as an insightful drama, and if it were a stage play, I would be raving about the terrific script and performances.  But to sit in a movie theatre trying to watch these two characters trying to make sense of their lives is just not what I consider entertainment, and if this were a television drama, I probably would have changed the channel.Rating 6 out of 10 "},{"Title":"How a situation can change decent people into raving lunatics!","Date":"12 April 2002","Score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama, Thriller","Review":"  ****Warning!!

The other major actors also deliver, especially those playing Doyle's wife, Doyle's friend from AA, and the hacker (who was deliciously evil).But the movie is well written. And very complicated. Both male leads face moral dilemmas that each could have been the plot line for separate movies, even if the two characters had never encountered each other. The accident and the revenge plots just add to the excitement level. And the writers didn't just give us a simple 'You got me, so I'm going to get you worse' sequence of events. Both characters had numerous opportunities to forgive and forget if they could just be mature. This was also true with the plot lines that would have had nothing to do with the accident.And of course a movie like this serves two purposes. As in the case of 'Falling Down', the main characters get to do what we may have fantasized about, so we get to live through them without facing consequences ourselves. At the same time, we are shown that these actions do have consequences, and we learn that we shouldn't act impulsively. (Or should.) The excitement level did not stay consistently high, because this was not really an action movie. But the tension stayed constant most of the time, and we were given the occasional energetic scene. The second car crash was really something to see.The ending was quite a surprise. I thought I could see what was going to happen, but I was wrong. I still found the ending satisfying.It was a very good movie.

This movie shows that we all have both highs and lows in life.The story just happens to all be on a Good Friday that doesn't seem to be that good after all. I believe all of this is happening in New York. Gavin Banek (Affleck) and Doyle Gipson (Jackson) are two busy men that are in a hurry to life-changing events. Banek is a lawyer and off to an important case that he can't lose while Gipson is off to a divorce court to save his kids. They're on the highway in a rush and get in an accident. They then, being in their rushing moods, are disoriented and continue their days in awkward ways. Within the 20-minute mark of the movie, both protagonists already are at their lowest and they're trying to make things right. They can't and they get even lower, involving even more people within their rage, this not necessarily being there's a good guy or a bad guy. Their struggles to bring each other down become even lower and lower, this entirely still happening on Good Friday.Overall, Changing Lanes is a great gripping drama with some thrilling elements and shows you how bad life can get unintentionally. There are definitely great performances by Jackson and Affleck and great direction by Mitchell. The screenplay is awesome in its own way. It's a great dramatic performance from 2002.My Rating 8/10 Objectively &#150; 8.5/10 Subjectively &#150; 8/10 Eliason A.

The actions of this movie happens all on Good Friday, when evil is let loose, not as the time when a Savior was crucified, but the daily evil that affects human life.  The love of money is the root of all evil, and the members of law firm is filled with that love as they seek to control a hundred million dollar foundation.We meet two men, Doyle and Gavin, who never would've met each other except for a car accident.  Instead of exchanging insurance info, Gavin refuses to take the time and offers a blank check.  Doyle wants to do the right thing and refuses the check, for which he is repaid by being stranded in the middle of the road.  However, as Gavin was searching for his checkbook, he drops a legal file from his briefcase.  That file becomes the basis of the story, which links the two men for the rest of the day.It turns out that both men were on the way to court.  Gavin, the rich white lawyer, arrives late and is given the rest of the day to retrieve the file.  Doyle, the black alcoholic who works for an insurance call center, arrives too late at the custody hearing, and loses his sons to their mother who is set to move across the country.So it goes back and forth, with a scene of each man's day being paired to one from the other's.  As the story unfolds, we see that the lanes that were changed were not merely what led to the car accident, but their lives.  A vendetta is unleashed as Doyle, so full of hope at buying a house and keeping his kids, responds to Gavin's destroying his hopes as a way to force him to turn over the file.  Both men outdo themselves as they sink lower into evil.Finally, Gavin wanders into a church to collect himself, and sees a processional of the cross; finding the only empty seat is in the confessional, he asks the priest to help him find some meaning in life.  At the same time, Gavin is showing his wife the old house he planned to buy, empty except for a picture of the `Sacred Heart of Jesus' left in the closet.  Neither man hears what they want, from the priest or the wife, but Jesus is what gives life meaning.  No amount of money can fix our past mistakes.  We can never get our lost time back, but we can move on and make the most of the time we have left.

So it was with great surprise that I realized about thirty minutes into the film that this wasn't a classic `revenge' tale. *Possible spoilers herein*Changing Lanes stars Samuel L. Jackson as a recovering alcoholic who is fighting to keep his ex-wife from moving to Oregon from New York with his two children by providing them with a modest house to live in.  Ben Affleck plays a young hotshot attorney who pretty much has the world at his fingertips.  When the two get into a car accident in the beginning of the film with no one being hurt, the careless handling of the situation by Affleck sparks events that end up changing both of their lives in the course of one day.  While the viewer can place equal blame on both parties for their actions, this is not a routine revenge flick due to the fact that morality and (seemingly) feelings of regret seem to follow both of these men, despite the fact that they continue on.   It also calls into question whether the events that take place would have precipitated the direction their lives eventually take, both personally and professionally.  These men are not heroes; rather, their flaws make them entirely human.  I am not a fan of Ben Affleck, in fact, I try to avoid his films as much as possible, but he was quite good in this film, as was the usually great Samuel L. Jackson. Of course, this was not a perfect film.  There were some plot holes, overly dramatic moments, and a completely useless scene featuring Ben Affleck in a church, but overall it was a sufficiently good and thought-provoking film.

Changing Lanes is about layers. Layers of character, layers of situations. There are no stereotypes in this movie, thus it appears to reflect the reality I have come to know in my lifetime.This film wasn't created for the 16-24 set. It is not about simplistic revenge, which can be brutal (pick a Michael Douglas movie) or funny (pick a Laurel and Hardy). This is about real people with complicated issues. The writers understand that money alone doesn't make you happy. That most families are dysfunctional only varying in the level of their dysfunction.It is about playing hardball in the game of life. Most of us have played softball, but we can't even conceive of what it is like staring down a 95 MPH hardball with 0.2 seconds to react. Such is the life of a Wall Street Lawyer who has it all, and yet has no self respect, as it is the life of an insurance salesman, who only wants to keep his marriage together and his children around.This movie choked me up.

I was expecting a grim story of a war of revenge sparked off by a car crash - a kind of asexual War of the Roses, with more blind rage and less black humour. This is the last thing anyone would WANT to see.I don't believe in revenge. Not only don't I think that the urge for revenge justifies anything, I don't think that there really IS an urge for revenge - at least, not as a stable mainspring of human behaviour. When we're wronged or injured, we want to strike back; to thump the guy who honked his car horn at us, say. But this feeling lasts, what, half a minute? I can't see the desire for revenge for a past wrong (as opposed to an ongoing injustice, like the occupying of one's city by an army) lasting, unprompted, more than an hour, and certainly not beyond a good night's sleep. People who desire revenge for longer than this have to really work at it, and they work at it, I suspect, because we've all been told that revenge is something we OUGHT to want. The desire for revenge, like the need to believe in supernatural gods, is a fundamentally unnatural desire we're told we have in order to sell us something.(It's no accident that, in fiction, revenge is used as a motivating factor mainly in B-grade genre films and Italian opera ... places where formula is everything, psychological accuracy counts for little any old trumped-up motivation will serve.)Changing Lanes understands the true nature of our desire for revenge. Of the two main characters Doyle is more prone to it in day-to-day life, and his acting on it is limited to, when he's under great stress, ripping out a computer terminal when he's denied a home loan which he badly needs (or thinks he badly needs), then wishing he hadn't. That's all. He lashes out - or doesn't - for a brief moment, then the feeling passes.In any case, the story isn't primarily driven by revenge even of this kind, but by misguided practical rationality. Gavin cuts off Doyle's credit not out of spite but because he thinks, and has some reason for thinking, that only by so doing can he recover the file he needs. Doyle - who by now, after maybe an hour, had lost all desire to strike back, responds with a threat partly out of a kind of moral pride (to not want to give into blackmail is not to want revenge), party to safeguard his own interests. After things turn much more sour each party engages in ONE act of revenge each - and regrets it immediately afterward - not so much out of a desire to hurt the other person but out of a desire to DO something, anything, in a hopeless situation. The fact that the two parties are talking to each other and bear no ill-will at the end is perfectly natural. Many people, of course, would keep the feud, which had never really been a feud in the first place, going, but if Gavin and Doyle had done so it wouldn't have been because they really wanted to; it would have been because they'd been told, by films less intelligent than this one for instance, that this is how people behave. It isn't. At least, if it weren't for the propaganda, it wouldn't be.Reading through the comments here the one that surprises me most is the claim that the film is boring. In fact it's the opposite the rare film that is not even a little bit boring. That people can be bored by a film like this, intelligent, well written, splendidly acted by all concerned (note also the supporting players, Sydney Pollack and Australia's finest acing export, Toni Collette), with something of genuine interest hanging on the outcome of each scene, and on top of it all worthwhile things to say, is as incomprehensible to me as it is that people can manage NOT to be bored by something as clumsy, as monotonously bloodthirsty and as empty as, say, The Two Towers. Oh well. Perhaps these people didn't bother really watching, because they thought it was about revenge.

The story centers on two men living very different life styles who through a quirk of fate, meet as the result of a traffic accident. Both it turns out, are headed to the court house for different reasons. Ben Affleck plays an arrogant self-centered Wall Street lawyer named Gavin Banek. He is going to court to represent his firm's takeover of child's trust fund. Samuel L. Jackson on the other hand plays Doyle Gipson who is headed to court for a custody battle with his wife (Kim Stauton) over their children. The accident changes both men's lives forever. Banek leaves Gipson stranded on the freeway but doesn't notice that he has dropped a file with information crucial to his case. Gipson arrives late for his court date after the judge has awarded custody of the children to his wife. Banek is given the rest of the day to produce the missing file in court and Gipson is distraught over the loss of his children. Banek, in an effort to force Gipson to turn over the file with the help of a colleague and former lover (Toni Collette - having a REAL BAD hair day), hires a computer hacker to effectively bankrupt Gipson and destroy his credit. Gipson on the other hand, tries to cause Banek to have a serious traffic accident to exact his revenge. Banek has to explain all of this to his boss and father-in-law Stephen Delano (Sydney Pollack) who arranges to fix things. Gipson now finds he is bankrupt and cannot get the loan that was approved so that he could buy a house in order to keep his children in New York. The film is fine to this point. In the last quarter everyone suddenly comes to their collective senses and Director Roger Michell takes us through yet another lives happily ever after Hollywood ending. It's kind of a let down after seeing the cat and mouse games between the two main characters. The movie leaves us wondering about a lot of unfinished business. Consider the following  1. Where were the cops at the scene of the accident?  2. On a crowded roadway, surely there would have been a few witnesses.  3. What happened to the leaving the scene of the accident charge?  4. Why wasn't Gipson charged with attempted murder for tampering with Banek's car? And again, where were the cops?  5. Did Gipson ever regain solvency?  6. What happened to Banek's marriage?  7.

It starts as an almost abstract fantasia on the differences between two Americans a white guy (Ben Affleck) who lives in a glass tower of a law office with fake Alex Katzes on the world; at the end of a hard day he comes home to Amanda Peet and a present--his father-in-law's old forty-foot yacht, thrown him as a bonus. The second American is a black guy (Samuel L. Jackson) grappling with his sobriety, wrestling his Rageaholic Issues, and trying to buy a house to keep his estranged wife and kids nearby. White and Black collide, literally, on the FDR Drive, and the rest of the movie Aristotelianly tracks their crosses and double-crosses and triple-crosses in the course of a single wearying, life-wrecking day.Unlike the issue TV CHANGING LANES sometimes feels like, the work of the screenwriters, Chap Taylor and Michael Tolkin (one suspects Tolkin rewrote the younger writer) has a feeling of uncanny end-of-nineties accuracy--unsteady fat cats feeling their cooked books coming home to roost, and have-nots getting steadily angrier at their have-notness. All the details are pleasurably right, down to the tinkly, Bryn Mawr voice Amanda Peet puts on to read a Paddy Chayefsky-like speech informing her callow husband that indeed, the world is corrupt, and why did he think she was with him anyhow? The director, Roger Michell (who made the passably pleasing NOTTING HILL) doesn't seem headed for the big leagues, but deploys one extremely useful stylistic device big, algae-oid, wobbly soft closeups that harden into focus, of a sort, when the faces loom close to the lens. You'd think this shtik would exhaust quickly; it doesn't. The images get at the theme of the movie the tireless pressures of the way the world is organized to get people to do the wrong thing over and over again. Tolkin, Taylor, Michell and company essay this hardheadedly, unsentimentally, more probingly than you expected; then they blow it with that candy-handing ending. It was, I guess, probably the only way the movie could get made--especially under the shockingly conservative aegis of Paramount Pictures.

While millions of people around the world are commemorating the crucifixion and atonement of Jesus Christ, Banek and Gibson find themselves acting out a little morality play of their own in the streets and skyscrapers of downtown Manhattan.  Along the way, they too will confront the issues of right and wrong, sin and redemption - and find out just how far into the depths of depravity their own moral codes will allow them to go.   Interestingly, the heightened unreality of some of the characters' more extreme actions brings to the tale much of the quality of a parable. As a result, we don't have to believe every twist and turn of the plot in order to validate and appreciate it.As the title of the film suggests, the theme revolves around what happens when the paths of two very distinct lives `accidentally' intersect.  These two individuals are total strangers before fate, chance, providence, the gods - whatever you want to call it - conspire to bring them together. Banek is a hotshot young attorney who has married into his father-in-law's wealthy firm, while Gibson is a recovering alcoholic and AA member who is trying desperately to close the deal on a house so that his fed-up wife won't move with their boys to Oregon, far away from Gibson's deleterious influence.  Both desperate to get to their respective court dates - Banek to argue an important case and Gibson to plead for one more chance to keep his family from moving away - the two harried men meet up in a mild fender bender during morning rush hour traffic.  When Banek callously palms Gibson off with a blank check and leaves him stuck in traffic to fend for himself, the wheels are set in motion for the strange, offbeat tale of revenge and recrimination that ensues.  In the confusion of the accident, Banek does not realize that he has accidentally left a crucial folder in Gibson's possession.  Gibson, mistreated by Banek at the scene of the accident and refused a hearing by the court because of his tardiness, finds himself in no mood to turn the other cheek and help Banek by returning his folder.  The resultant game of cat-and-mouse, which could so easily have devolved into a cheap, tawdry melodrama of violence and revenge, instead achieves surprising moments of thought provoking depth and insight.`Changing Lanes' is, indeed, that rarity among American films a drama more concerned with issues and ideas than with cheap thrills and emotional exploitation.  Within the context of a densely plotted thriller, writer Chap Taylor has fashioned a film that is nothing less than a study of the part ethics plays in our daily lives.  Like all of us, Banek and Gibson contain within their beings both the seeds of goodness and the germs of evil.  The question becomes how far each is willing to go to cultivate those qualities when faced with the dilemmas and vicissitudes life throws their way.  Both men, though basically decent at the core, find themselves doing deeds that surprise even themselves when pushed into a corner by despair and desperation.  Rarely in the movies do we find characters this concerned with analyzing both the motives and the consequences of their actions.  In fact the film plays out like a classic morality play, with each man engaging in an internal struggle with his conscience as well as with the other person. The underlying cynical subtext is, of course, that, in the corporate business world, all morality is relative, a fact Banek, in particular, is ultimately forced to face up to - and, by extension, to act upon.Although it does seem to strain a bit to make its point every now and then - employing overemphasis when subtlety is what is really called for - the film boasts a number of beautiful and haunting moments such as when the director, Roger Michell, intercuts between a quiet, but highly charged and revelatory conversation Gibson has with his longsuffering wife and a scene of Banek seeking surcease from his guilt in a quiet confessional.Ben Affleck and Samuel L. Jackson both do superb work at getting to the bottom of their respective characters' innermost feelings and thoughts. David Arnold's somber musical score and Salvatore Totino's moody cinematography lend an appropriately otherworldly quality to this stark morality play, making the everyday world of city streets and soaring skyscrapers seem strangely twisted and menacing.`Changing Lanes' does lose its nerve a little at the end, as evidenced by a certain softness in its resolution. Nevertheless, it still deserves enormous credit for attempting to do what few other films even have the courage to try.   It's truly refreshing to see a film that respects the intelligence of its audience and which provides moviegoers with a little nutritional sustenance to go along with all that cinematic junk food Hollywood normally provides for us in such abundance.

This is a revealing tale of two souls with anger building with each scene and not only with each other but with themselves as well.The film takes time in showing what the two leads- Ben Affleck as a wall street lawyer on the verge of making partner and Samuel L. Jackson as a meager insurance worker on the verge of getting a divorce- and it works by building a good level of familiarity with the two.  They get in a fender bender on the FDR in the morning, Affleck flees the scene without leaving an insurance card for Jackson, and without a crucial file folder with a paper he needs to get to the courtroom.  This isn't good news for him, and neither is it for Jackson's character who arrives late to the divorce court and left with nothing.  This also starts a struggle for one to get the file and the other to get his 20 minutes and dignity back.  But it goes a little deeper than you'd expect than that, which is just one of the film's sweet surprises.Hollywood needs to make more movies like this where formulas aren't pumped into situations that clearly can go on interesting routes and turns, and give the cast and crew space to expand on ideas which better the movie.

I'm sorry, I live in New York, and there's no simply way that a Manhattan lawyer is ever - in this or anyone else's lifetime - going to offer a blank check to a total stranger after they've had an accident.  My partner almost bailed out on the film at that point.  She tried to suspend her belief, especially since the movie had just started, but this ridiculous premise tested her sorely.  If Affleck is in such a hurry, why doesn't he simply exchange business cards with Jackson?  A blank check?  Please.  There are several other unbelievable parts of the story the file worth hundreds of millions of dollars that's so casually lost; the fact that it's the only official copy in existence; Jackson - who wants to take care of the accident correctly - obviously not bothering to call the police, whose report would have helped him in several ways (and, in fact, why do the police NEVER show up at all, especially since there are eventually TWO CARS simply abandoned on the busiest highway in New York - I don't think so); the whole fire sprinkler routine to get a simple file - we're talking thousands and thousands of dollars worth of water damage to a large law firm, not to mention Affleck's own desk, just to get into an unlocked drawer?; the hacker being able to delete and restore so many of Jackson's important accounts so quickly; etc., etc.  Worst of all, why does Affleck never mention or seem to care about the fact that Jackson almost killed him?  After exhibiting so much rage throughout the film, you'd think he'd bring it up at some point.Finally, the ending is terribly flat and uninspiring after the long build-up of tension.  We're served up a high (and very shallow) moral lesson during a sappy Hollywood climax that defeats the well-developed ambiguities the rest of the film worked so hard to create.  All the good acting Jackson did to create a complex character is thrown out the window as the foes suddenly and boringly settle their differences, Affleck makes a little speech, and then he even solves Jackson's familial drama - all in two minutes.*END OF SPOILERS*It's interesting to consider what could have been done with this film.  A better writer and a better director could have turned this into a real classic.  The elements are all there - they were simply poorly executed.  Instead of the uninspiring ending, it would have been interesting to see more of a duel between the two protagonists, in which their rage and anger and their desire to do good all come into play.  The premise of the story deserved a better portrait of trying to survive and do well in an often hostile and confusing world.

At the same time recovering alcoholic Doyle Gipson is also due in court to contest his ex-wife moving away with his son and taking her visiting rights with her.  The two men meet in a minor car crash where Banek leaves Gipson at the crash site.  Gipson misses his case and loses custody of his kids while Banek finds that he has accidentally given a key legal document to Gipson by mistake.  Gipson is angered by Banek causing him to miss his date and begins to take revenge, sparking a small battle between the two men.When I came to see this I assumed that this would be one of the genre that sees a man or family terrorised by a person whom they have wronged in some way.  At the start I assumed Doyle would become increasingly violent and it would all end in a big stand off in the same way as The Fan did.  Happily this showed itself to be much better than the majority of the genre and much more intelligent.  The plot manages to be as much about each men deciding what is right and wrong within their lives as it is about their private war of attrition.This is where I found it enjoyable &#150; it never allows itself to be solely about the war becoming increasingly violent.  In fact only once does the action take the form of a potentially violent act.  Instead the moral struggle both men find themselves over their lives make interesting watching.  This is due to a combination of things.  First of all the writing is much better than the average genre pic, it's clever and paced well.  Secondly I found the direction to be excellent throughout &#150; long shots where we focus on a character responding to things we can't yet see, arty or clever shots etc.  It all made the material more interesting and always held the eye.The element that works best is the acting.  The performances take a good script and take it to work.  Affleck is good, and bare in mind I don't like him.  But here he has a good character and works well with it.  He is a cardboard character at the start but the more we know about him (and he about himself) then he becomes more real and Affleck copes with this better than I expected he could.  The real star is Jackson.  At the start he is such a real character that I was sad to think he would become a `normal guy pushed to the edge' cliché.  I was real happy when he didn't!  Even on paper Doyle sounds like a stereotype `recovering alcoholic losing his kids' but Jackson never lets him become what we expect him to.  The support cast are all very good as well and do more than just provide background &#150; they provide depth.For course it is not without flaws.  Many people will be let down that it moves so slowly or lacks the sort of spiralling action seen in Single White Female, Falling Down or Pacific Heights &#150; but this is more than those genre pics.  Also sometimes the plotting is a little muddled and, while the overarching theme is good the detail doesn't quite hang together as it needs to, however this is a minor flaw as there is a lot to do.  The biggest let down is the ending &#150; or at least the final two scenes.  Prior to this the film is almost downbeat in it's moralising and reality of right and wrong.  However the ending is simply to tidy and neat and doesn't fit with the complexity dealt with prior to this.Overall I expected an average thriller type film but was surprised to find a film that manages to avoid cliché as best as possible.  In place of the usual spiralling violence the film tries a (albeit muddled) look at the modern view of right and wrong, what is for the best and the worst.  Flawed yes but a very brave attempt to do something different and clever with a very clichéd genre.

Samuel L. Jackson brings real depth to his portrayal of a man with, apparently, a lifelong cloud over his head.  He alternates between taking charge and wandering in a bewildered Is this happening to me? state.  Ben Affleck is like no young big firm partner in a major law firm that I've ever worked with or known but that's okay.  He has his moments and his lack of depth as an actor is an asset for the role he portrays.  Sidney Pollack is, again, that very familiar SOB we all recognize in an instant and hate on cue.  William Hurt, in a small role as Jackson's A.A. buddy, is compassionately real.So Jackson and Affleck get into a fender bender on New York's FDR Drive on a weekday morning.  Amazing.  Traffic rarely moves fast enough for even a minor accident at that hour but this is the movies.  The ensuing and escalating drama as Affleck desperately and evilly seeks the return of papers left at the accident scene and now in Jackson's possession becomes more unreal by the minute.  Jackson's conduct, in turn conciliatory and then vindictive, has more meat and meaning. But not that much.In the young partner's firm legal ethics do not exist.  Neither does the slightest respect for the law.  Are there lawyers as corrupt as those portrayed in the film, Sidney Pollack being especially prominent for his sneering disdain of his profession and its ethical norms?  Of course but those lawyers aren't stupid and the Changing Lanes counselors are.  Big time.  This is a flat parody of attorney dishonesty, not an example of the reality. Still, for lawyers and law students the film has its moments.

Note - this is not an endorsement of Changing Lanes per se, it's still a wildly uneven and mostly ridiculous movie with several glaring moments of Bad Acting 101. However, the movie honestly tries to fashion an old-fashioned psychological melodrama, it tries to intelligently explore the psyche of the Prototypical Shallow Alpha-male. The movie even tries for thematic richness - the two lead characters embark on journeys rife with parallel ethical battles and temptations, both making mistakes and both with several opportunities for redemption. The movie even hits the mark by providing both our heroes with minor victories along the way - imagine, a contemporary film structured in a way that thinks outside the box, and actually moves with a certain rhythm, as opposed to the predictable narratives that usually pop up in modern cinema.Dare I say, the director even has a tiny speck of style. Aside from Ben Affleck, he's populated the film with all sorts of character types. Real people with quirky faces and distinctive personalities. Most of the performances are actually strong - even the most secondary characters enter the film with a sense of internal life and energy. Toni Collette gives emotional credibility to her hackneyed role. Ms. Staunton is nothing short of dynamite as Sam Jackson's fed-up ex-wife; her level of commitment and honesty is a such a welcome bit of relief from the usual Modern Hollywood Fare. Dare I say that Ben Affleck delivers his best performance yet. Again - not an endorsement of Ben Affleck, who is still miles away from even beginning to remotely understand how to construct a believable character. However, he registers emotion, and much of it actually seems to come from a genuine place. Hell, there's an even an unbroken extended two shot at one point! Can you imagine? In today's era of meaningless editing and rapid cuts, we get a nice long extended shot of Affleck and Collette as they approach a turning point in the story, we actually get a bit of form that serves the characters, that serves the story. Capra must be singing in heaven right now!Of course, this is all about the lesser of all evils. Changing Lanes is a ponderous, largely superficial movie that is motivated by charcters who routinely behave in the most irrational and unbelievable of manners. It strives to be a character drama, but relies heavily on expositional dialogue to articulate its point (at one point, sponsor William Hurt tells alcoholic Sam Jackson You're not addicted to alcohol, you're addicted to chaos!). The movie is about a half hour too long and is crammed fill with Hollywood Character Traits - Sam Jackson is the recovering alcoholic who's just trying to be a better Dad to his kids, and so and so forth, boo-hoo, cry me a river. The directorial style is largely meaningless with a lot of nonsensical editing that makes for muddied action. Not to meantion the faux cinema verite that tries to pretend the movie has more intelligence than it actually does.  The movie attempts to explore characters' psyche, but wastes too much time on contrived plot machinations and hackneyed cat and mouse games to really achieve dramatic credibility.But it tried! Oh, how it valiantly tried! An old-fashioned man-vs-man urban Western. A big-budget Hollywood movie tried to use the thriller genre to explore character. Oh, how my heart aches for this brave director. Please, let this signal upward trend in the today's moviemaking. Please let today's movies understand that romanctic comedies and thrillers and courtroom dramas can be about actual characters - flawed, interesting characters. Sigh, I'm getting my hopes up.

With so much happening all the time, everywhere, and with so many different ways to go, people have become preoccupied, which can be dangerous if the momentum propelling an individual happens to come to cross purposes with that same kind of momentum driving another, and the two converge.  And it happens.  `Things' happen; and when they do, the important thing is that all parties involved react responsibly and focus their individual attention on the matter at hand.  If either side fails in this regard, it can mean big trouble.  it means you suddenly have a situation; and it's just such a situation that is explored by director Roger Michell in `Changing Lanes,' a tension filled drama starring Ben Affleck and Samuel L. Jackson.	Gavin Banek (Affleck) is a successful lawyer, a partner in the firm and married to Cynthia (Amanda Peet), the daughter of his boss, Stephen Delano (Sydney Pollack).  He's currently handling a probate case worth millions to the firm; he's due in court, where he simply has to present a document that will, for all intents and purposes, wrap up the proceedings.  But fate is waiting in the wings.  In another part of town, Doyle Gipson (Samuel L. Jackson) is also about to wrap up a deal-- a loan for a house that will keep his estranged wife, Valerie (Kim Staunton), from moving with their two boys, Stephen (Akil Walker) and Danny (Cole Hawkins), to Portland, Oregon, or as Doyle sees it, half way across the world.  	When Gavin and Doyle get into their respective cars to head to court, they are strangers to one another; they are about to meet, however, when heavy traffic on the expressway and their own preoccupied mental states precipitate a collision-- a minor car accident that ultimately effects a much bigger wreck in both their lives.  In his rush to meet his appointed court time, Gavin leaves the scene of the accident and, more importantly, leaves Doyle-- who also has an appointment in court (his child custody hearing, no less)-- stranded, and out of time.  Ironically, the document Gavin must file in court is inadvertently in the confusion of the accident left behind on the expressway, and is now in Doyle's hands.  And so the conundrum; loss of the document may mean jail time to Gavin.  To Doyle, the loss of twenty minutes may mean losing his children.  The question now is, how will these two men solve their dilemma?  One has what the other needs, but how do you give `time' back to someone?	This film, nicely fashioned by screenwriters Chap Taylor and Michael Tolkin, and extremely well crafted and delivered by director Michell, is at it's core a character study that examines the effects of desperation and the emotional responses elicited thereof.  It explores how anger and frustration can in the heat of the moment negatively affect even an individual who under normal circumstances is predisposed to abiding by his own conscience; how even the most rational among us has the capacity for irrational behavior if provoked by unmitigated circumstances.  At one point in the film, one of the characters observes that it's like two guys have been dropped into a paper bag together and shaken up, just to see what happens; and that about sums it up.  And Michell does an excellent job of keeping the story on track, setting a good pace and maintaining the tension that keeps the audience involved.  It's straightforward storytelling that is well presented and effective.	As Gavin, Affleck gives a solid performance, developing his character quite nicely as the story unfolds.  When the film begins, Gavin is in a comfort zone, a place that allows him the tunnel vision necessary to do what he does with a clear conscience.  In a way, he's naive; a guy who's been led down the path and made to believe that all is well in the land of the free.  By the end of the film, we see a different Gavin-- or at least an `awakened' Gavin; the same man, perhaps, but with an entirely different perspective on life.  And Affleck's portrayal makes it convincing, and brings Gavin to life in a very real way.  A good job by a fine young actor with the ability to tap into that emotional depth that makes his character believable.	Samuel L. Jackson hits his stride, as well, as Doyle, a character whose outward demeanor masks the complexities lying beneath the surface, but which Jackson brings incisively to light.  Doyle is your average guy, an insurance salesman, but a man plagued by the demons of addiction; he's a man addicted to chaos, evidenced by the failed relationships in his life and his inability to cope with the situation engendered by his encounter with Gavin.  Jackson creates a character with whom you can empathize, even as he makes you aware of the rage within him that could explode at any minute.  Doyle understands only too well the dire, probable consequences of being unable to quell his anger, and through his portrayal, Jackson makes the audience aware of it, as well; and it's a pivotal point in the story, which he successfully conveys.  And it's that unstable element of Doyle's personality that makes this more than just a story about right or wrong, or who's going to win; it means anything can happen, and it keeps you wondering right up to the end what that something is going to be.	The supporting cast includes William Hurt (The Sponsor), Toni Collette (Michelle), Richard Jenkins (Walter), Tina Sloan (Mrs. Delano), Ileen Getz (Ellen), Sam Rovin (Paralegal) and Jennifer Dundas (Mina).  A morality tale that, be advised, does not take too kindly to lawyers, `Changing Lanes' is an engrossing film that delivers much than what is promised, even, by the trailers; a worthwhile cinematic experience.  8/10.

Unfortunately for lazy minded marketers everywhere Changing Lanes shows what any cinemagoer could tell you, that the quality of a film is all in it's execution.Ben Affleck and Samuel L Jackson are both in a hurry when they collide on a downtown freeway. Affleck takes off before exchanging details but without a crucial file for the case he is trying, whilst Jackson misses the custody battle for his children. This then leads to an ugly game of tit for tat revenge between the two, as they both sink lower and lower to salvage something from the day.Despite the entire story taking place over a handful of hours the film has no tension, pace of immediacy, though this is a probably a side effect of the apathy that the lead characters provoke. Whilst Affleck and Jackson are perfectly cast as the lawyer losing sight of his morals and a desperate recovering alcoholic who seems to be fighting the whole world at once, the film never brings either to life. This is doubly galling since a good performance from Affleck seems to come once in a blue moon and so it is especially painful to see it go to waste.By the time the fudged ending ruins what respect the film may have gained for it's gritty style you will be too sick of the shaky handheld camera work and improbable character decisions to care.

In the end things do get a bit preachy and syrupy, but this doesn't matter, because the film's message is a strong one and the dialogue is not spoon-fed to the audience, a failing of so many modern films.

I say this as someone who has been battling partisan lawyers since 2002.Changing Lanes accurately portrays how lawyers have fallen out of their role of protecting the truth and justice, into making the money all that counts.The movie is fast paced, full of twists and turns and moral themes that are challenging. A rich lawyer dealing with an accidental encounter with a down and out man who is trying to return to having personal dignity becomes a good story about how the rich lawyer learns a lesson in what justice really is.This movie may be fiction but it is more honest to what 'the system' has created. I am hopeful that a movie like this might move citizens away from what the writers suggest in the clip provided with additional features. We need to move away from 'acting better when in vehicle accidents' to really challenging the corruption that starts with our legal professionals inside our nations.I remain skeptical about society's possibilities in rising up from the couch after watching this movie, that ends up with a good message for 'our highest'. Oh, Google my name below to understand why I like this fictional portrayal of the realities that apply to 'lawyers', all but know that the motives of 'getting rich', as portrayed in the Woman In Gold, have overwhelmed our social responsibilities.Changing Lanes, being made when 9/11 happened, becomes a better portrayal of what our personal responsibilities should be... rich lawyer or not... A movie that will remain in my collection for this reason alone, even if I never watch it again.Don MacAlpine, Wolseley, Saskatchewan, Canada "},{"Title":"Could not Grasp Attention","Date":"2 October 2015","Score":"","Genre":"Drama, Thriller","Review":" Changing Lanes stars Ben Afflect and Samuel L.

More happens in that single day than happens in an entire year of most people's lives! So, yes, the plot is fast paced. I did not find the acting poor, as some reviewers have complained. I actually found that it was pretty good, not only the Affleck and Jackson roles, but also the portrayal of the father-in-law by Sydney Pollack. But the Ben Affleck character was just too pure to be true! After marrying into his super-wealthy father-in-law's firm, he then seems to believe that he can transform the whole corrupt machine into a shining pillar of altruism! I hate to be this cynical, but I must say that if any real corporate lawyer attempted what the Affleck character claims that he will do at the end of the film, he would be found dead in the not-too-distant future of either a stroke, a heart attack, an apparent suicide, or a single-car accident. That is the reality of how ruthless the people in this arena really are. Saints do not fall into such commerce by mistake.

It's held together by strong performances from two actors we already know always live up to their potential, and is often suspenseful thanks to the way the plot allows each character pretty much equal screen time.The film stars Ben Affleck and Samuel L. Jackson. Affleck is Gavin Banek, an affluent New York City attorney, who is racing down the highway to file a power of appointment document to assure that he now owns the assets to a dead man's foundation because the man signed it over to Banek's firm before he died. Jackson is Doyle Gipson, a recovering alcoholic in a rush to attend the custody hearing of his two young children so his wife doesn't take them and move to Oregon. Banek and Gipson get into a small accident, resulting in Gipson bearing the most damages, with a bent bumper and a flat tire. Banek doesn't have time for the insurance card exchange game and writes Gipson a blank check. Gipson asks for a lift, but Banek tells him that he needs to be somewhere, never stopping to ask Gipson where exactly he needs to go. Banek drives away before telling Gipson, better luck next time! This exchange and accident is really no one's fault. Both men are in a hurry, both men have opposite but equally serious lives to attend to, and, had this been a normal day where they were each driving to work or to lunch even, the meet wouldn't have been as hectic or as rushed. When Banek arrives at the law firm, he is missing a crucial file in his power of appointment case that he believes he left with Gipson, and when Gipson arrives at his hearing - after walking in the rain - his twenty minute tardiness results in his wife getting the custody of the kids. Both men are now frustrated and angry at the circumstances and at each other. What follows is a game of one-upmanship between the two men, as Banek tries to get his file back, which Gipson now has possession of, and as Gipson tries to overcome urges to drink again and the fact that he just lost his two sons.This story wouldn't be half as good if Affleck and Jackson weren't such great screen actors. Both men portray stressed and conflicted to a great level of believability as they do not become overcome with petty revenge motives and senseless actions that are nothing but minor annoyances or ill-conceived, overdramatic kneejerks. The acts of revenge both men commit on each other are realistic and have the ability to scar each other the most, but never do they stretch the realms of believability. Affleck, who has spent years working with thrillers and action films, knows what he is doing in terms of allowing character to bleed through a caricature. Jackson does as well, and together, both men illustrate a biting rivalry that is underrated in contemporary thriller cinema as far as I'm concerned.Changing Lanes was directed by Roger Michell, who amplifies the stress in various scenes of the film. Consider when Banek and Gipson are racing down FDR Drive, trying to get to their desired destinations. Michell is careful to show the hectic qualities of the scene, the bumper-to-bumper traffic, the last-minute lane changes the may shave thirty seconds off your commute, etc. Michell captures it all and thus makes Changing Lanes an active viewing from a directorial standpoint. As if he didn't have enough strong talent to portray on screen with Jackson and Affleck occupying it, Michell works to make the film riveting in terms of camera shots and tension creation, while writers Chap Taylor and Michael Tolkin work on giving the film a realistic tone to the project.Starring Ben Affleck and Samuel L.

And, really, that is part of the beauty of this movie -- we naturally want to pick a side, like one guy and dislike another. But they are both flawed people.Affleck is selfish, cheats on his wife, cuts off a guy's credit, flees an accident... his only redeeming quality is he is the only non-corrupt member of a law firm, though that hardly makes up for his failings. Jackson has a terrible temper, breaks things, has little self-control and is an alcoholic. Sure, he wants to reunite with his kids, which is noble, but maybe he should not be able to.

I like the element of two people making really stupid decisions and letting their emotions control them and showing how that kind of thing can lead to things getting way out of hand really fast. In one day, two men effectively destroy each others lives because of an initial bad encounter that neither men are willing to move on from. I love the scene later with William Hurt as he shouts at Jackson's character telling him he's addicted to chaos. He should be given credit for the fact that after a cool down period he was about to give the file back, but had he been willing to fix things earlier, the whole mess could have been avoided. As I see it, both men are to blame in the end. That is why I love the ending of this movie.

Exactly where it goes wrong, however, differs from viewer to viewer. I would nominate the confessional scene. Obviously designed to change the hero's heart, it rings false to me and seems out of character. The fact that there's no build-up or previous reference to religion, doesn't help either. Yes, I realize that such a scene is necessary, but usually it's the heroine or the best friend who brings a protagonist to his or her senses. To introduce a priest from left field goes right against the grain &#x96; particularly as we've had no inkling at all of religion or religious beliefs up to this point. So, for me, the movie just fell apart. A pity! They spent a lot of money on it, and Sydney Pollack gives a great performance, easily outshining the nominal stars, Ben Affleck and Samuel L. Jackson. An excellent Paramount DVD. "},{"Title":"This is a neat little movie","Date":"17 May 2012","Score":"","Genre":"Drama, Thriller","Review":" Changing Lanes is fundamentally about two men who do bad things but are trying to do better. The main difference is that one is endorsed by society -- Ben Affleck's wall street banker -- and one isn't -- Samuel L. Jackson's alcoholic deadbeat dad. This difference in their social stations drives them into a conflict that causes both of them to revert to their worst impulses.As much as it offers ordinary revenge thrills, Changing Lanes is notable for recognizing the complexity and inequality of our social structure, which dominates even the most powerful of the characters in the film. Even the most obvious villains have reasons for their actions, and one can see how they're pushed into playing out their social roles. At the same time, it's not entirely deterministic -- there are right things to do, but they're difficult, usually involving hurting someone or giving up on some principle or another.Affleck acquits himself relatively well, although he's still Ben Affleck. Jackson is predictably great, as this is back when he still sometimes cared, and Amanda Peet is fantastic in a brief but memorable role as Affleck's amoral wife. Of course, the film is more than a bit melodramatic, with things escalating to a ridiculous extent over the course of one day, and the attempt at reforming Affleck's character towards the end feels a bit forced. It's still a mainstream Hollywood drama, and never really deviates from that style. But it's better than most such dramas, and is in the end a nice film that's been already forgotten as part of the ebb and flow of popular cinema. That forgetting is kind of justified -- it certainly won't go on anyone's best-ever list, resting as it does in the realm of the merely above-average -- but it's still worth a couple hours of your time.

The plot? Samuel L. Jackson plays Doyle Gipson, an African American insurance salesman who's struggling with a divorce, AA meetings, financial problems and much stress. His car collides with Gavin Banek, played by Ben Affleck, who works for a law firm. Gipson is a man of integrity. A man who wants to do right by everyone. Banek, in contrast, is a wealthy shark routinely asked to do morally questionable deeds for his company. The duo's collision thus results in a sort of heated, class conflict. Unfolding over 24 hours, we watch as the couple lock horns, engage in battle, and attempt to ruin each other's lives.Despite some resemblance to Falling Down, Changing Lanes is a refreshingly old fashioned film, feeling like some noir potboiler or race-relations thriller from the 1950s, or perhaps even something Stanley Kramer (vomit) may have directed. It touches upon white entitlement, the psychic scars of disrespect, the dignity and depravity of human beings, and the importance of responsibility and responsible individual actions, but is smart enough to wrap this all up in thriller dynamics. Like most big studio films concerned with the nature of morality (our heroes cycle through temptation, redemption, anger, chaos and reflection), however, things are kept strictly on the level of personal, individual ethics. The systemic issues which make Gipson and Banek's lessons void and unworkable, are ignored.Michell would direct the truly offencive Morning Glory some years later.7.9/10 &#x96; Worth one viewing.

The other one loses his case. And then everything goes down because each one will try to pressurize the other into repairing the damage and they will cause even more damage by doing so. The film then is a thriller in a way since we expect any moment more violence and more retribution and more vengeance. Dependence is the worst thing that can hit a man, be it tobacco, alcohol, drugs or plain catastrophe or anti-social reactions. Lawyers are all crooked and perverted and sick in their minds and you can decide to do more good everyday than you do evil, if you are a lawyer you can be sure you will never keep that word. So you better give five dollars to the beggar round the corner in the street that will probably be the only good action you will do today. Good action? My foot! Since that money is going to enrich a bar tender because the bum is going to drink it. And if you are a mischief maker, a catastrophe bringer, a crash perpetrator, you better stop drinking, stop smoking, stop getting under the influence of anything and retire into some kind of padded monastery or reclusion center for the mentally insane because there is no way you will change and the world will change. So better get used to it and let things go down the chute from bad to worse and then to the worst.

In an electrifying scene his beautiful, high-maintenance wife lists, with chilling candour, her marital demands, and baby, they don't include love! Can the two men save themselves from an impending moral and spiritual implosion?

It's a good title - the two principals get into a fender bender when they inadvertently cross lanes on a highway. Yet the lanes aren't really those of a road, rather they are the career and life paths that the two character seems to be following unquestioningly.The crash leaves both men late for a court appearance, a nice conceit in itself, given that the law is a practical civic expression of majority morality. The unsatisfactory outcome of their morning in court sets in motion a reactive game of tit for tat in which each blames the other for their misfortunes - but their own failings rise to the surface with alarming clarity. It's a good blend of action and revelation, although to effect the entire thing in a day stretches credulity to its limits.Affleck's flash-n-fresh lawyer Baneck is solid but not quite as good as Samuel L Jackson's Doyle; both labour manfully under the compressed schedule of episodes.

Both men angry and bitter, start to take revenge against each other, a war that will either define both men or break them in two.Changing Lanes stars Ben Affleck Banek and Samuel L.

But it's with the writing that Changing Lanes should be noted, written by Chap Taylor more known as a PA for Woody Allen and Michael Tolkin The Player & Deep Impact, Changing Lanes is much more than your average movie about someone having a crappy day. Marketed poorly as a film about men driven to the edge of insanity fuelled bloodthirsty revenge, the piece is intricate in its plot misdirections and adroit at keeping its characters from being stereotypes. These guys are just normal human beings, no daring do heroics or villainous traits to speak of, just your everyday stressed New York inhabitant trying to survive the rat race. Each man is poles apart socially, yet both are drawn together equally in their new found insanity!This is the crux of Changing Lanes' heart, just what will your average sane man to to another under duress? It begs a question that the writers here, thru a series of zippy twists, really open up the picture, the ironies of which are at first hard to appreciate. But Changing Lanes is a film that should be revisited, especially for those who didn't get the film that the trailer and the marketing campaign originally hinted at. Even allowing for the cop out ending, which smacks of a studio bigwig demanding an audience pleasing closure, it's a film that oozes intelligence and thought provoking astuteness. It took me two viewings to fully digest the excellence of its apparent normality, with one restaurant scene between Banek and his wife Cynthia Amanda Peet particularly worthy of another look.

Ben Affleck and Samuel L. Jackson both feature as lead roles and portray very different characters to what we are customary to. The film is in relation to Gavin Banek (Affleck) and Doyle Gibson (Jackson) who are two very different men with two very different lives. The storyline is fairly simple and easy to follow. It begins when both of their cars collide which results in Doyle's car being damaged. Both men are running late for court. Doyle (Jackson) has to go to court to deal with his divorce and custody of kids. Gavin (Affleck) has to attend court to show a file for the firm he works for. On the scene of the accident Gavin (Affleck) can't find his insurance card so he writes a blank cheque for Doyle (Jackson). Doyle strongly disagrees with this action and wants to do things right, despite the fact that he is also in a hurry. There is no stopping Gavin (Affleck) as he quickly returns to his car and escapes leaving Doyle (Jackson) on the scene of the accident.However, Gavin (Affleck) leaves behind a crucial file which is needed for his court case. This is left on the road and Doyle (Jackson) picks it up. When Gavin (Affleck) arrives in court without his file he is told it's possible that he will be sued and sent to jail along with his law firm if the file isn't retrieved. Doyle (Jackson) manages to get to his court case but unfortunately arrives 20 minutes late. The judge finishes off just as Doyle enters the court room concluding that Doyle's wife had won custody before Doyle got the chance to represent himself. This leaves both Gavin and Doyle irritated with each other and they begin to face moral consequences as they fight a battle in the modern world.I consider Changing Lanes as a very smart film. There is a lot of suspense and I had no idea how it would end as there were many twists and turns throughout. The script is predominantly dialogue and I was very impressed with the acting from both Jackson and Affleck. Affleck proved that he isn't just a movie star but is also a skilled actor. He normally doesn't have much dialogue and is often criticised for this. I like it when actors risk themselves by dealing with a different set of challenges. Jackson also played a character completely outside his boundary. He is normally casted as someone who's quite 'hip and cool'. The character he plays in this is the complete opposite and very awkward. The film focuses on two characters and I felt the film really explored them. The main appeal for me was observing them together as they are both at different ends of the scale and wouldn't have met under any other circumstance. Gavin (Affleck) is an idealistic young lawyer and Doyle (Jackson) is a desperate father who is a recovering alcoholic. They both get very malicious and go out of their comfort zone by doing things they've never done before. Roger Mitchell directed this after previously directing Notting Hill. He is a very creative director who I feel is underrated and this film proves it. Chap Taylor wrote the script and co-wrote the screenplay. I am very surprised that he hasn't written anything else to the present day or prior to Changing Lanes. I recommend this film to fans of both Affleck and Jackson. The film has elements of mystery, suspense and drama. I haven't slapped it on my top ten list and I don't think many will. However, it's enjoyable enough and I do recommend it to anyone curious.

Affleck is attorney Gavin Banek, late for court, when he has a car accident involving Doyle Gipson (Jackson), who is also on his way to court to protest his wife taking his children to live way across the country. Not wanting to mess around with insurance companies, Banek offers to write Gipson a check. Gipson, however, is a recovering alcoholic and has made a commitment to do everything in a clean way. He wants to trade insurance cards. Banek can't be bothered and gets into his car, leaving Gipson standing on the highway in torrential rain, although he asked Banek for a lift.When Banek gets to court, he finds he does not have the power of authority necessary to prove that an elderly man knew what he was doing when he fired his board and assigned the law firm to administer his trust. He realizes that he left the folder at the scene. Gipson arrives to court too late to speak on his behalf and finds the Judge has made a decision against him. Banek is desperate to find Gipson and get his document back, since he has only until the end of the day to file it with the court. And Gipson? Well, he just isn't in the mood to return it. Thus begins a war with each man having the goal of total destruction of the other.Despite other comments on this board, I truly enjoyed this film and found the hard lessons learned by both men as the result of a random accident very interesting. Banek is encouraged by an ex-girlfriend (Collette) to question the power of authority and the role of the law firm in administering the trust; Jackson comes up against his own acting-out behavior, rage, and as his ex-wife says, addiction to drama.Changing Lanes is about changing one's path in life from a crooked road to a straight one.

While these tend to come with general good intentions of stealing your money and occasionally entertain during the process, it's those neglected films like this that make me really appreciate modern day cinema for what it is.Changing Lanes is an original tale of two strangers whose course of lives accidentally bump into each other &#150; initiating a personal war between the two. Gavin Banek (Ben Affleck, in one of his last roles before the notorious Gigli crash-and-burn) is an ambitious lawyer on his way to an important court sitting. Doyle Gipson (Samuel Jackson, who seems to have appeared in every second film to come out this decade) is a middle-lower class businessman, a former alcoholic who is on his way to a custody hearing with his ex-wife. A minor car accident between the two men causes Gipson to miss the hearing; after Banek refuses to give him his details or help him out, despite being directly responsible for the accident. However, Gipson discovers he has some papers Banek needs badly, and he now has every intention to make him pay for stranding him in his most desperate hour. Now, the two men have everything to lose, but instead of helping each return to the normal course of their lives, they end up hurting each other again and again in what turns into a personal, breathtaking vendetta.Affleck and Jackson's clash of the titans is a powerful tale of despair and decisiveness. Its plot is more than meets the eye, containing numerous subtle ideas as well as the obvious ones displayed on screen. For those who haven't seen it, it's a gripping experience; one that makes you reach deep within yourself and ponder - how would you react if you were one the wrong side of the accident?

Jackson especially did a great job of showing rage. It was a thankless role as you could tell he would rather be doing something else. Ben Affleck is good as the sleazy lawyer who eventually does the right thing. So watch this movie only for the two leads.Other than that, the movie doesn't get better. It starts out fine but gets boring from there. I really preferred the TV movie Outrage with Rob Lowe, a movie similar to Changing Lanes, but was better. The characters are all really unsympathetic. The supporting cast, especially the lawyer's father-in-law, and his partner, acted and delivered lines appropriate of the supporting cast in a high school play. I won't give the ending away but it should have been better.You might watch this for the great but wasted performances of the two leads. However, the biggest reason to watch this is to see if it gets better and presents interesting action and drama. Too bad that doesn't happen here.

It would be easy to dismiss 'Changing Lanes' as another piece of mindless drivel that Hollywood churns out oh-so-regularly. But look a little closer, and you will begin to notice that this is a very frustrating film. Our dichotomous minds like to think in terms of black and white, evil and good, Darth and Luke. This film is refreshingly different because it presents us with two diametrically opposing characters; and just like in real life, it has been left for us to decide who we want to root for. On one hand is Ben Affleck's hotshot attorney who's rushing off to meet a court appointment deadline. On the other hand is Samuel L. Jackson's alcoholic insurance salesman who is also in a rush for a hearing over the custody of his children. Their mid-highway car collision quickly escalates from road rage to unscrupulous vengeance and then utter moral breakdown. As we fascinatedly watch their cat-and-mouse game of one-upmanship, we shockingly realise that these ethically challenged individuals could very well be a mirror for ourselves. The movie obstinately refuses to side with any one character, presenting each one as a mix of the vile and the pitiable. The dubious moral ground that these characters stand on leave us questioning the world we live in, where nothing is as simple as choosing between the chocolate mudcake and the strawberry sorbet... there's always got to be that lemon meringue pie!

Samuel L. Jackson was the perfect choice to play Doyle Gipson. Jackson has always managed to have a somewhat comedic quality, a satirical one, for none of his antics or even the events that befall him should be funny, and yet, they are.I absolutely loved the plot, as it was the perfect mixture of parody, exaggerated circumstances and real-life drama. It made me laugh, it made me feel worried sympathy, and it also managed to keep me on the edge of my seat- and didn't attempt to achieve the last by direct physical conflict between the characters.Whoever said that Ben Afleck was a bad actor, obviously hasn't seen him in this movie. He too played his role perfectly, and a few of his scenes were especially impressive.A quick note that I would like to add in this review. If you have seen, and liked Falling Down with Michael Douglas, Barbara Hershey, and Robert Duvall, then you would definitely enjoy this movie as well. The crazy, sometimes incredulous sequence of events in Changing Lanes reminded me a lot of Falling Down.

The way it's put on stage draws attention at once. Lots of silence, close-ups (even just parts of faces). Some internal tension. Different plot lines are interlaced in sound and pictures... I even thought that must be some famous director, but I don't know him (although it proves nothing, I'm not an all-knowing movie geek).To honestly say, the story itself didn't catch me too much, since its essence can be very roughly put out as two mules set against each other on a narrow bridge over the abyss. The tension appearing accidentally between formerly unfamiliar to each other lawyer (Affleck) and businessman (Jackson), each of whom has guts and power, grows into vengeance rage of the kind when you try to kill a fly with a sledge-hummer. At the same time both of them have their own moral and principles, which undergo a transformation in the finale of the story (actually a kind of stories I appreciate). Well, emotionally it's not my elements, but the way the film is set, directed, filmed is truly gripping. Those are two (at least) equal righted stories of life, deep, extended, very psychological.Each character impresses with the depth of his personality, internal tension, a whole life can be sensed very brightly behind every sentence even of second plan characters and all is performed very well - a rare thing for Hollywood with its little demand for psychological acting!... I was particularly impressed by lawyer's wife, Michel, by her woman internal beauty, softness, tenderness, depths of feelings and understanding... all that while she advised her husband to compromise with his consciousness for which he never went. It is in general impossible to judge any characters right or wrong. The story is told from either side. A beauty of each personality and a truth of their beliefs can be seen very well in the same time as the unresolvable conflict between all of them. Well, I know the idea is not new to me, but the main is that it is brilliantly fulfilled! The most funny thing is that from the first moments of the movie I caught, I recognized Affleck from behind! While he's not among my favourites and I haven't seen many movies with him (well, if you count Dogma 15 times, may be I'm understating ) ) This mad me understand he must have some very specific gesturing manners, a kind of clearly recognizable bodywrite...Well, the essence of the final transformations of main heroes escaped me - I lost what and how exactly turned their beliefs upside-down (may be I was distracted by something or should have watched from the very beginning). But anyway I took immense pleasure in seeing this beautiful unusual piece of movie are. A very interesting movie!

'Changing Lanes' is pretty much a cycle of revenge that starts with an accident caused by corporate lawyer Gavin Banek who hits recovering alcoholic father Doyle Gipson, as both, unbeknownst to the other are on the way to court for different reasons. From then on each drastic act of revenge escalates to another more extreme act leading to more severe consequences. Michell gets to the point right from the beginning and from then on his focus remains on these two characters. Moving at a steady pace, he adds plenty of energy not leaving any room for a dull moment. In addition Chap Taylor's writing is superb. Not only are the characters well written and the story grabs the viewer's attention right up till the end, but his dialogues are very effective as they mix of humour and wit with irony and drama.Samuel L. Jackson delivers one of his finest performances. He is very relatable as the recovering alcoholic father who is trying his best to stay clean and be a good father and to some day win back his estranged wife but unfortunately he keeps finding himself in complex situations. The actor is restrained when required and explosive when needed. Ben Affleck gives his first good performance (which shows his potential after being in the industry for a long time) and he has since given some great performances in 'Hollywoodland' and 'Extract'. The supporting cast is formed by an ensemble of talents that include Toni Collette, Kim Staunton, Dyland Baker, Amanda Peet, Richard Jenkins and Sydney Pollack.'Changing Lanes' has all the ingredients of a clever gripping thriller. However, it could be argued that the ending was a bit safe. Even though things are rounded up well, I wonder how it would have been if Michell continued with the escalating cycle of revenge until it ended with disastrous consequences.

Well, it quite good as well. Sadly, though, Changing Lanes only has about 10 minutes of said fun. The rest of the time, the two unsympathetic characters are mostly bitching and whining other over the phone, trying to find new ways of messing with each other. Those parts only serve to show just how limited actors Affleck and Jackson really are. Yes, even Jackson, who still seems to be doing his Pulp Fiction thing.The film wants to show the audience how important it is that we all get along; Affleck's young rich white guy, versus Jackson's older poorer black guy. How about easing off the stereotypes and switched roles for the two leads. That would have given the film some much needed dynamics. Well meaning as the film makers are, they throw in some lines about how African-Americans can achieve success without the help of white people. Of course, they make sure that in the very schmaltzy ending, Affleck comes to the rescue and saves Jackson. Way to go guys! As mentioned earlier, there are some fun moments when Affleck and Jackson battle it out in an over-the-top fashion, but they come few and far apart. Dylan Baker is also great in a small role, but that's about it. Otherwise, it's predictable, quite ugly looking, and with a musical score that's so out of place that it's horrifying. 3/10 "},{"Title":"A good thought provoking drama/thriller showing that everyone has their highs and lows.","Date":"25 August 2004","Score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama, Thriller","Review":" Changing Lanes stars Ben Affleck and Samuel L.

This movie shows that we all have our real highs and our real lows in life.The story just happens to all be on a Good Friday that doesn't seem to be that good after all. I believe all of this is happening in New York. Gavin Banek (Affleck) and Doyle Gipson (Jackson) are two busy men that are in a hurry to life-changing events. Banek is a lawyer and off to an important case that he can't lose while Gipson is off to a divorce court to save his kids. They're on the highway in a rush and get in an accident. They then, being in their rushing moods, are disoriented and continue their days in awkward ways. Within the 20-minute mark of the movie, both protagonists already are at their lowest and they're trying to make things right. They can't and they get even lower, involving even more people within their rage, this not necessarily being there's a good guy or a bad guy. Their struggles to bring each other down become even lower and lower, this entirely still happening on Good Friday.Overall, Changing Lanes is a great gripping drama with some thrilling elements and shows you how bad life can get unintentionally. There are definitely great performances by Jackson and Affleck and great direction by Mitchell. The screenplay is awesome in its own way.

This film features some good crisp direction from Roger Michell and a strong cast. The film has little logic and the idea is very Hollywood, but it is executed very well. Gavin Banek (Ben Affleck) and Doyle Gibson (Samuel L Jackson) are involved in a freeway smash, whilst both are in a hurry to be at important court appearances. Banek, a Lawyer, who should have known better, leaves the scene and leaves Gibson on his own when he has to be at an important custody case involving his ex wife and two sons. Banek has also left important documents at the scene which he needs. So having lost his kids for the sake of being 20 minutes late thanks to Banek, he decides not to give the documents back to Banek, and this starts a chain of events of Banek doing things like bankrupting Gibson, to get his files back and Gibson retaliating.Ben Affleck has always had one complaint levelled at him in the last few years, in that his career is too hit and miss. Not just the standard of his films but his own performances as well. Ben can either look like a good actor or a bad actor, he as yet has not looked like a great actor. Changing Lanes marks a tick by the side of it in Affleck's CV. He is good here as the Lawyer who becomes the catalyst for this remarkable day of revenge.Samuel L Jackson rarely has such complaints about his acting but one thing can be levelled at him in one respect, and that is a degree of typecasting. He has different roles, yes, but he always plays cool characters. Here Jackson plays a normal guy, not cool, but flawed. His character is made so that the audience feels sympathy for him, and we do thanks to Jackson's performance. I also have to agree with the general critical consensus that this is Jackson's best performance in years. The rest of the cast are good, including Toni Collette.The film has a good pace to it and never gets boring and despite the fact it all gets a bit over the top before a rather Hollywood ending. The films ending is a bit to tidy and a bit to nice but by the end we start to feel for Jackson's character and Affleck's character also becomes more ethical and sees his own life in a different light. The day itself becomes an indicator for both men about where their lives are going wrong. I didn't mind the nice ending despite the fact it felt very typical of Hollywood. I felt that I wanted things to come good for Jackson.Overall this is a good thriller, better than most that Hollywood are churning out these days.

It gives the film a very bleak, negative look perfectly fitting the screenplay.  Also Affleck is just superb in his role.

Specifically, the premise that Jackson has lost his day in court because he showed up late due to Affleck's having left the scene of the accident is unrealistic. All he had to do was get to a phone and call the police, or just wait for the high probability that a passing motorist would call 911 with a cell phone, get a police report and show it to the judge. He would then have been in a great position to collect big bucks from Affleck's auto insurance and been able to get an even nicer house. Plus Affleck would be in trouble for having left the scene.Second, I found it impossible to accept that a presumably capable attorney such as Affleck's character would not be so careless as to not have made COPIES of a document as important as the one he left with Jackson. To put it another way, do they really expect us to believe he only had ONE COPY, ESPECIALLY when the person who signed is is DECEASED????No, I can't accept it. Then the tit for tat thing is old and was done much better, and much more amusingly, by Laurel and Hardy in their famous short, Tit for Tat.Many other details were simply too preposterous to accept, such as the private eye/hacker being able to nullify Jackson's credit in just a few keystrokes.

Sidney Pollack is the hard-nosed, senior partner, and father-in-law. Nice to see him on this side of the camera. Where has he been?  He turns in a Jason Robot like performance here. William Hurt's role was cameo and serves to deliver a comment about Jackson's messed up life. You are addicted to trouble, he said to Jackson. All in all, I am glad I did not pay big bucks to see this in a movie theater.

So is it with anything less than pure surprise that this doesn't turn out to be an action or buddy picture? Not only does this film happen to be a character-driven thriller, it's also an intriguing look at societal pressures on the human individual, delivering in a manner that is intense, edgy, and perhaps even quite frightening.Ben Affleck stars as Gavin Banek and Samuel L. Jackson is Doyle Gipson. Banek is a high-priced lawyer who is ready to finalize a big deal with will turn over a recently deceased millionaire's entire fortune to his firm. Gipson is a recovering alcoholic who's doing everything he can (mainly by purchasing a house in Queens for them to settle in) to save his marriage and keep his wife from taking the children and moving to another state. Both Banek and Gipson are on their way to court when their cars crash into each other. Gipson wants to get everything done legally, the right way, but Banek is in too much of a hurry, so he simply leaves a blank check and takes off to court, leaving the other man stranded. However, Banek leaves the most important file at the scene of the accident (which Gipson is now in possession of), and Gipson misses his own court hearing, losing any chance for custody of his kids to his wife. Banek's determination to get the file back and Gipson's anger and frustration turns this cross of paths into a game of cat-and-mouse and revenge which makes for probably the most lopsided day of their lives.Changing Lanes is a film that surprised me almost every minute of the way. There's a lot of plot and theme at work here, but I want to emphasize that this is hardly pretentious filmmaking; it's an honest look at just how far pressure can push normal men, as well as how such pressure can bring out the best qualities in these same people. After a rather clumsy introduction and a chaotically directed crash scene that felt rather rushed, the film settled in comfortably into its main story. On the surface, the movie plays perfectly well as a thriller, certainly enough to satisfy thriller buffs looking for hard-edged suspense. But further yet, the film becomes a character study of two men who lead opposite lives, but perhaps aren't as dissimilar as each may think. Rich and affluent, Affleck's Banek is a man on the top, but despite his seemingly arrogant and impatient behavior, he displays a moral and conflicted center, torn by what's right and what everyone else-namely his boss, co-workers, wife-says is right. Undoubtedly the most complex character Affleck has ever played, this is also the young actor's best performance to date.Samuel L. Jackson is easily one of the best actors around, and his portrayal here is absolutely terrific, perhaps his most substantial performance since his role in Pulp Fiction. Gipson is certainly less priveleged than Banek, and this societal gap displays an interesting effect once things get out of hand. Gipson represents the majority of us, the working middle class that's frustrated when fate hands him a wrong turn. The disastrous day that Gipson endures is affecting, and it's both simultaneously crushing and exhilarating to see a reasonable man go to the extremes. There are far more themes at work here, and I've only touched on the surface. For instance, there's a powerful scene where Amanda Peet (as Banek's wife) delivers a coldly manipulative speech that clues us in as to why Banek would cheat on his beautiful wife with a less physically attractive, but far kinder, more emotionally supportive woman (played well by Toni Collete). Another similarly powerhouse sequence is Sydney Pollack's (playing Banek's boss) diatribe on ethics in business and why the cutthroat method is the only effective tool for pressing business matters. With an abundance of moments like these, there's so much theme at work in the script that the film simply demands repeat viewings.Changing Lanes is always entertaining, thanks to Roger Mitchell's well-paced and sure-handed direction, and the script never falters when it comes to both story and thematic material, mixing both together without ever coming off as preachy. The film has lots to offer, and for viewers willing to take the ride, the rewards are plentiful. It's been a fine year for movies so far, and without a doubt, Changing Lanes is one of the best cinematic offerings to date.

The film starts as Ben Affleck and Samuel L. Jackson turn a simple fender bender on FDR Drive in Manhattan into psychotic road rage. As the day wears on they set out to ruin each other's lives through a campaign of dirty tricks, or as the movie's tagline explains, `One wrong turn deserves another.' It's a good premise, nicely acted by Affleck and Jackson, and well told by British director Roger Michell, whose work here is particularly surprising as his previous efforts haven't been thrillers, but comedies (Notting Hill) and period drama (Persuasion). It's familiar territory. 1993's Falling Down breathes the same air as Changing Lanes in a story about a man pushed past his limit, and the consequences of his rage. Unlike Falling Down, Changing Lanes delves deeply into the reasons for the anger, and the characters don't like what they see. Both Affleck and Jackson realize that they are more afraid of themselves, and what they have turned into, than each other. The movie remains strong until things start to fall apart near the end. Tacking on a happy Hollywood ending seriously undermines the power of this story.

But, in Changing Lanes, Banek instead bears down, takes personal responsibility, and brilliantly forces others' hands, with courage, justice, and compassion.

The characters are totally believable (we can feel the pain of Jackson's character when he realizes that he may never see his two boys again) and the plot is not surreal.  It is quite possible in today's world.The music is not an essential part of the movie, but adds to the tension when necessary.  David Arnold knows when to keep it low and out-of-sight and also when to blare it in our ears to let us know we should be afraid for the characters (not like he needs to tell us).Changing Lanes is a great drama.  One of the better movies of the year, in fact, and it should have done better.  It is a little underrated, and I definitely suggest seeing it.

Two imperfect men Gavin Banek (Ben Affleck), who is an overly-confident lawyer and Doyle Gibson (Samuel L. Jackson), who is a recovering alcoholic, get into a minor fender bender on F.D.R. Drive. The two politely ask each other, Are you O.K.? No one is hurt. Banek wants nothing to do with the situation because he's late for an appointment in court; Gibson, the same reason, but wants Banek's insurance information because he wants to do the right thing. Banek thinks that a blank check will solve the problem and leaves Gibson stranded in the middle of the road, unknowingly leaving a crucial document in Gibson's possession and so the battle begins... Changing Lanes is so far, one of the best reviewed films of 2002. Roger Ebert gave it four stars and has already claimed the film as being one of the year's best. Ben Affleck and Samuel L. Jackson both give superb, if not Oscar worthy performances. Their performances are the heart and soul of this stunning and fast-paced film.The film wastes no time in establishing the lives of both of the lead characters. We see that Banek is currently in the middle of a huge court case that if he wins, he will be one of the richest men in New York. Gibson, the recovering alcoholic, is desperately trying to keep his marriage from falling completely apart. He thinks he can save his marriage by purchasing a low-rent apartment that he can move his family into. From the previews you would also probably expect the film to be a no-holds-barred thriller with lots of action. No-holds-barred, yes. Lots of action. No. But what we get is something a little short of a psychological thriller, as it deals with two completely different guys trying to stay one step ahead of the other. After the fender bender, both men engage in a series of escalating battles to see who can outdo who. Banek consults a man who fixes things. What I mean by fixing is that the said man will wipe Gibson's bank accounts clean. Gibson reacts to the situation by refusing to hand over the crucial document that Banek wants so desperately.In many ways, Changing Lanes reminds me greatly of Falling Down, another film which explored the worst of human emotions. That film starred Michael Douglas as a man whose pent up feelings of hate and rage escalated into a city wide orgy of violence. But where Falling Down had a man whose worst qualities are brought out and has him violently lashing out at the wrongs in society, Changing Lanes has two men, already at their worst, unleashing their frustrations on each other.Changing Lanes, as already mentioned, is a stunning film that deserves to be nominated for several Oscars. I give it a 10/10.

The trailers implied that this film was about violent, or otherwise insidious, acts of revenge. Even the movie's tag-line One wrong turn deserves another only exemplifies the poor marketing.  As a result, many of the reviews here on IMDB are from a skewed viewpoint -- people went to see one kind of movie when, in reality, Changing Lanes is about something completely different.The premise is basic enough Two people get into a fender-bender.  Nobody is injured.  It's not really anybody's fault.  Both parties have to be to court at a certain time. A verbal dispute takes place resulting in Jackson's character being left stranded in the rain with a flat tire.  Affleck gets to court on time, but discovers that he left a crucial document with Jackson's character by mistake.  In a lesser film, the evil Affleck character would have tried to take the document by force, but Changing Lanes rises above -- Jackson's character faxes a page of the critical file with Better luck next time! scrawled on it.  Thus, a day long struggle between the two characters begins.Changing Lanes focuses on the two main characters Gavin Banneck Ben Affleck and Doyle Gibson Samuel L. Jackson.  These two actors portray their characters phenomenally.  This is another flawless performance to add to Jackson's record. Affleck is at the height of his ability, coming close to (and perhaps surpassing) his performance in Chasing Amy.  Each character has his own explicit motives for acting the way he does.  These motives are laid out for viewers in ever increasing detail as the film progresses.Jackson's character seems to have a failed life.  He is addicted to chaos (as his AA Mentor tells him) not because he enjoys it, but because it is an escape from his own, miserable reality.  He walks into a bar looking for a fight, not a drink.  After he has calmed down from his chaos high, Jackson's character wants to do the right thing by giving the file back to Affleck.  As soon as he finds some reason for conflict (usually provocation by Affleck's character), he readily engages.  Jackson's character does not have an epiphany like the Affleck character does, but he is a changed man in his own way.  Perhaps he has finally come to terms with his chaos addiction?Affleck's character is much more developed and much more interesting.  He suffers the most change and experiences the most toil.  Unlike Jackson's life, Affleck's life seems successful  he's just been made a partner of a wall street law firm, he's rich, and likes what he does.  In the beginning, Affleck's character seems to have turned a blind eye to the evils that have transpired in his firm.  He is naive and utters such phrases as ...but we didn't do anything wrong! in a vain attempt to put himself in the right. As the film progresses, he begins to question the motives of those around him, specifically, the motives of his two other partners.  If they were such good partners and personal friends, Affleck's character wonders, why did they send me into that courtroom alone?  Eventually, Affleck begins to question his own motives and finally comes to an ultimate epiphany. They have to write their own letters is a classic idea that has been repeated in various films, but still feels fresh in this one.With such brilliant acting, a strong plot, and competent direction, it's quite odd that the film seems to end on a weak note.  Upon multiple viewings, the ending seems to have improved, but only because the motives of the characters are now fully clear to me.  The ending is lackluster and does not reflect the revelation and progression of the characters.Changing Lanes is about Affleck's character's acceptance and then later rejection of his immoral and meaningless life.  He even confesses to a priest that he is looking for meaning in the world.  Why does the world need meaning, the priest asks.  Because the world is a sewer!, says Affleck.  This film takes two people, analyzes them and reaches the conclusion that while their lives are completely different (Jackson is a low-salary insurance salesman while Affleck is a wealthy wall street lawyer), the moral values of both men are essentially the same.9/10 *The weak ending prevents the film from achieving a 10/10.

You may think one thing about a character, but then think different of him the next minute.Samuel L. Jackson is Doyle Gipson, a working class man who is running late to court for custody of his kids. He, while on the freeway, bumps into Gavin Banek (Ben Affleck), an important lawyer late for a case, too. Gipson's car is inoperable, but Banek, worried that he'd be late for his court case, leaves Gipson standing in the middle of the freeway. Banek accidentally left an important file with Gipson, one that could cost him winning the case or not. Tempers heat up when Gipson is very late to his court, but Banek needs his file.It's a compelling dramatic thriller; it's not a thriller where you're wondering when the ax-weilding maniac is going to jump out, it's the thriller where you don't know what's going to happen next. You can guess one thing, and be completely wrong. It's been awhile where there was a thriller where little violence was shown and people don't go on killing people. It tangles with your emotions. You feel bad for Gipson, you might feel mad about Banek just leaving him there. Not many movies can do that.Of course, the best part of the movie is the acting. Sam Jackson was simply mesmerizing. He can control his anger (in the movie) for some time, but when he snaps, wow! What a great actor at work. Affleck was surprisingly good (a whole lot better than The Sum of All Fears); his emotions, though not as emphasized as Sam's, are pretty well made. I liked how it seemed someone was the good guy and someone else was the bad guy, and then it got reversed. That is good filmmaking.What didn't I like about it, you ask? Well, the ever-popular Amanda Peet needed a bigger role, and it had a not-so-intense ending, but other than that, it's solid. I know when I'm old enough to drive (be afraid, be very afraid), I'll be cautious whenever I'm driving down a New York freeway in the rain (on Good Friday, of course). A thing that wasn't so great was it's trying to get religion into play. Why did we need it to take place on Good Friday, what was the point about the church? But, director Roger Michell might be very religious himself and want to put in various themes. That's fine with me.If you want a human dramatic thriller, this is it. If you want a good, original story, this is it. If you want great (nay...superb) acting, fast-paced plot, tense scenes, this is it. Human emotions are abound here. It can make you feel good and bad at the same time. As I've said before, not many movies can make you feel like that. Basically, don't rent this if you're not a fan of good movies with excellent acting. One thing I just remembered-the sub-plot about the affair seemed unecessary, but it still didn't bother me that much.

Jackson as a deeply flawed, humdrum yet somehow passionate ex-alcoholic insurance salesman who's trying to buy a house to persuade his wife to remain in New York with their two little boys.  The plot is a bit too high powered, depicting as it does a pumped-up battle between the two men when a car crash fatally delays Jackson's character from a custody hearing and leads Affleck's to leave his key `power of instrument' document in Jackson's character's hands before another hearing, in his case to determine the legitimacy of Affleck's powerful law firm's control over a huge charitable trust which its founder's daughter disputes.  Through the course of one day the two men battle each other with imagination and reckless abandon. It's more than a little implausible what they do.  But questions like why there would be only one copy of that `power of instrument,' as well as the big one as to why the two men would both try such desperate measures against each other, are kept at bay by quirky photography and constant, well timed cuts that keep the scenes continually so interesting that I was on the edge of my seat from first scene to last.  Sidney Pollack, as in Eyes Wide Shut, plays the role of a rich and powerful man who bends morality, and he's awfully good at that.  Affleck is, in a way, just a big lug, an overgrown baby, a boyish bully, but there's a confusion and vulnerability about him that for the first time in one of his big roles invites genuine sympathy.  Jackson's performance is restrained, neutral, without any of his usual mannerisms.  He loses himself in the role, and it's a seamless, elegant performance.  He has a sad, bloated look, and when he sits for an hour staring at a glass of bourbon in a bar without touching it the improbable event seems believable because there is such a sense of powerful repression in his characterization.  Affleck contrarily is loose, flabby, exposed, like a spoiled prep school boy who's discovering that the world is not his oyster after all.  Some of the philosophical moments &#150; especially Affleck in a Catholic church railing at a father confessor about the unfairness of life &#150; are excessive, but the movie succeeds in keeping the volume turned up so consistently that such moments blend in.  I knew I was being manipulated shamelessly, but I stayed in thrall.  The moral issues brought up are pretty interesting and treated not unintelligently, however over-inflated the plot.  Roger Mitchell is a director worth watching.

Where to begin...first of all I will say that some people, who are far more experienced in the movie critics area say that Changing Lanes is beautifully filmed and full of irony, and wonderfully directed, and brilliantly shot and guess what?? Who cares. I go to see a movie to be entertained, not to see if some guy with a camera can film Irony. I want to be moved, and excited, and scared, and sad, and happy...I don't care how it's shot. Sometimes you see a movie that you just know right away is going to be a critical HIT!! You go see it and it leaves the average person feeling empty, and undecided and impartial about the whole experience and you probably forget you even saw it by dinner time. Guaranteed that's the movie that everyone will be supposedly raving about and everyone will walk home with an Oscar. Apparently that's how I see Changing Lanes. The story is simple enough and very intriguing (in theory.) A man (who is a former Alcoholic and now trying to piece his life back together) is on his way to the Courthouse to try and get joint custody of his sons. On the freeway he is sideswiped into a barrier by a hurried lawyer on his way to Court. The Lawyer brushes the man off and leaves the scene of the accident, accidentally leaving behind a vital piece of information in a file folder that could bring his whole firm crumbling down and cost them millions of dollars. Because the lawyer screwed up the man's chances at getting his children back, making him late for court, the man begins to play a push and shove game with this file folder making the lawyer jump through hoops. Instead the Lawyer starts to shove back in his own way and each man tries to top the other with horribly psychotic mean spirited things. Samuel L Jackson is wonderful. He truly is great as the man at the edge of things, trying to get his kids back, and trying to do what is right but suddenly finding himself on the wrong end of a very bad day. Ben Affleck is...ridiculous. If I see this kid (what is he like 12) play one more big shot attorney or some other high affluence job I'm gonna think the world has got nuts. He is not believable as a partner is one of the cities largest law firms??? He's TOO YOUNG!! and shows it, and not that great an actor. Ben Affleck hasn't made me want to see a movie since Armageddon or Good Will Hunting (ah Ben those were the days when we only had to see you on screen for five minutes total and two lines.) Ben Affleck could be a good actor but he picks parts that just aren't believable for him. Although his immorality and getting to the end of his rope were good everything else in his character just didn't fit. It ruined the whole story line. My second problem with the film is that no one seemed to notice through out this movie that Samuel L Jackson's character who is kind of the hero who we feel sorry for...is a COMPLETE LOONY!!! The man tries to kill someone, and he goes berserk every time someone breaths and starts trashing offices??? Yeah let's root for this guy to get his children back. Ben Affleck's character should have been the one flipped out, now that would have made sense and would have fit the story line much better. But instead they have this father who we are supposed to care for who is basically out of his mind. And the ending was a ridiculous happily ever after ending that was inappropriate. Overall I give this movie a 5/10 and I suggest you spend your 12 bucks going to see The Scorpion King or save it for something cool like Star Wars Episode II, or Spiderman. Changing Lanes was poorly put together.

Blueblood lawyer Gavin Banek (Affleck) and middle-class insurance agent Doyle Gipson (Jackson) are headed for the same courthouse. Both are late to their appointments.All the problems to come could have been resolved had Gavin simply given Doyle a ride but, Gavin's mind is on Gavin and what Gavin needs to do. Better luck next time, he shouts unfeelingly as he drives off, leaving Doyle stranded. If you can swallow this (an attorney leaving the scene of an accident after having done nothing but throw a blank check -- yes, a blank check! -- at the insurance agent), go ahead and enjoy the rest of the Swiss cheese snack.Gavin makes it to the court on time, while Doyle does not. Each man suffers repercussions from the accident -- Gavin has lost an extremely important file (he left it behind after using it to write the check on), and Doyle has lost his visitation rights to his two children, because he wasn't there to speak in court. He tries to explain about the accident to the family court judge, but his pleas fall on callous ears. Now both men are desperate... Doyle wants his day in court back, and Gavin wants his file back. Rather than getting together (Gavin is a high-powered attorney, after all... doesn't he know anybody in the legal system who owes him a favor?) the two decide to punish each other for what happened.Doyle withholds the precious file once he finds out Gavin needs it back (the two meet by chance on the street), and Gavin decides to make Doyle's life a living hell.The thing I liked about Changing Lanes was that there was no clear cut good guy and bad guy. Neither Gavin nor Doyle is entirely at ease with the chain reaction of revenge and one-uppances, but they continue to do it. Why? We're never told outright. But it seems Gavin is addicted to power, and Doyle is addicted to pandemonium, which is fueled by his alcoholism.There is one scene in which his AA sponsor, disgusted with him after having to bail him out of jail, tells him, You're addicted to chaos. The role of the sponsor is played by William Hurt and he is a fine actor, but imagine how much cooler the chaos speech would have been coming from Jeff Goldblum. (Note to casting directors Think!)The director and editor (Roger Michell and Christopher Tellefsen, respectively) have done a great job of switching back and forth between the two men as they act and react. The movie does veer over the top at times, but it's tempered with the occasional laugh. Since Michell is best known for his smash comedy, Notting Hill, it's not surprising that these few and far between moments actually have more honest impact than the drama of ethics.Affleck is believable as the cocky yet conflicted attorney, and he is supported by a strong cast (Sydney Pollack as a hard-nosed attorney, and Dylan Baker as a gleeful computer hacker work well; Amanda Peet as his wife, and Toni Collette as his girlfriend are both underused). Kim Staunton as Mrs. Gipson is quite credible in her tired resignation, but the best thing about Changing Lanes is definitely Samuel L. Jackson. The worst? No famous Samuel L. Jackson speech.Yes, the story is completely implausible and outrageous, but remember truth is stranger than fiction. Just watch The History Channel or the Biography Channel and you'll quickly realize that. Sometimes God likes to put two guys in a paper bag and let 'em rip, Gavin says in the movie (to a priest, no less). And sometimes, it's fun to watch the bag rustle.

Gipson too has to be in court, where he has an appointment involving the custody of his children. Because his car has been wrecked in the accident he asks the attorney for help. But the man leaves the scene of the accident and strands the salesman, causing him to miss his custody hearing and to lose the right to see his kids. But just after the accident the attorney accidentally dropped the papers he needed to present in court. Gipson picked them up and kept them with him. Now that he is furious because of all what has happened to him, he will seek his revenge and will try to make Banek's life as miserable as possible...Despite the fact that I feared the worst about Ben Affleck's performance, I must say that he did a good job. It's perhaps not the best one ever, but it sure worked in this movie. However, in my opinion it is still Samuel L. Jackson who is the star of this movie. Once again the man gave away a very fine performance. But even though I don't have any complaints about the acting, I can't say the same about the story line. Next to being rather predictable from time to time, it is also a bit far-fetched in my opinion. For instance having a man declared bankrupt because he has some files of you, who comes up with such an idea? You can sue him, perhaps you can even send a few thugs after him to convince him that what he is doing isn't such a good idea (you know, mafia style),... I don't know, you can do so many things, but why bankruptcy? What would have been his next step? Sending a professional hit man after him? I'm sorry, but that one I didn't buy.Still, that doesn't mean that the rest of the story isn't enjoyable. Overall this isn't a bad movie and I must say that, most of the time, I had some good time watching it. That's also the reason why I would give it a score between 6.5/10 and 7/10. Although maybe not perfect, it sure is worth a watch.

He plays the role of an Uncle Tom who could take on Mike Tyson. Sidney Pollack as Ben Affleck's boss is even more unbelievable.I can easily conceive that he is ruthless and completely unprincipled. I've met many people just like him at work. But is he really that stupid? He is after control of a $10,000,000 foundation. Would that control all depend on ONE document? You would think that he would have the old man sign several copies. And if it did depend on one document you would think he would have a special courier to keep close watch on it when Ben Affleck took it to court. Finally, would he leave incriminating documents, documents that could send him to jail, in a filling cabinet in the office where anyone can grab them?Then there is Dylan Baker as the hacker. He can effortlessly break into the data base of a credit company and modify Samuel L. Jackson's credit record. If it was that easy the credit card companies would be losing billions of dollars. They would out of business in a week's time. In reality it would take the resources of the cryptographers at the National Security Agency to do that.Then there is the scene where Samuel L. Jackson demolishes a computer worth several thousand dollars at some financial institution. He walks out and nobody goes after him.

Jackson (as Doyle Gipson), who isn't paying attention to heavy traffic on the FDR highway. The resulting crash causes both men to wreck important court appearances. Mr. Affleck has to bring a file containing an important power of appointment to a case, but accidentally leaves the file with Mr. Jackson. And, Jackson is late for a hearing involving shared custody with his two children, which he loses.The bulk of the film shows Affleck trying to retrieve his file from an understandably angry Jackson, who wants to be a good husband and father. Changing Lanes is a moralistic drama, with purposeful symbolism - there are at least a dozen Christian references sprinkled throughout. For example, an image of Jesus Christ appears in long-shot, which is used to bless the Queens house where Jackson hopes to be reunited with his family. Satan appears in more concrete form, as the corrupt lawyer played by Sydney Pollack. William Hurt is an Angelic figure. And, God is involved, behind the scenes.Three subservient female roles shine - Affleck's wickedly beautiful wife Amanda Peet (as Cynthia), his ex-lover assistant Toni Collette (as Michelle), and Jackson's determined ex-wife Kim Staunton (as Valerie). We are lured into liking Jackson's character, but he is so violent while sober, you wind up fearing for the children. The wobbly camera style is employed throughout, drawing attention to the camera operators instead of the characters. Director Roger Michell does well when he can keep the camera still. His young lawyer interviewees and other scenes in Affleck's office building are good.***** Changing Lanes (4/7/02) Roger Michell ~ Ben Affleck, Samuel L.

One man (Ben Affleck as Gavin Banek) is a lawyer, and is fighting a case in the courtroom that is tinged with ethical dilemmas whilst the other man (Samuel L Jackson as Doyle Gipson) is fighting for joint custody of his children after making an effort to reconcile his family with the token gesture of buying a house.  Changing Lanes is predominantly a film that centres around the &#145;what ifs' of life and the issues that stem from this revolve around fate.  The idea isn't exactly new with &#145;Sliding Doors' touching upon this exact scenario whereby perhaps even the tiniest thing could have profound effects on a number of lives.  The film goes beyond that though and delves into the human nature of frustration and anger as both people involved in the accident are left with more problems than what they started out the day with.  In the case of Gavin Banek, he becomes intrigued by his case and asks himself personal questions of those around him whilst also analysing life for answers.  And Doyle Gipson who is fighting to save his family and who is also battling alcoholism also finds himself angered at the injustices of the world and there the perpetual cycle continues.  In all honesty the film was below average and on times was quite boring. Affleck and Jackson didn't seem to have any spark though and their characters didn't make any lasting impression.  The script was a little one-dimensional and rather predictable and although there were clear signs of moral issues and dilemma's being addressed the film seemed too jaded and lacklustre.

The score made me think very much of Insomnia (2002), and to a certain degree, Pi.  This is one of those movies that can't be grasped just by a plot outline.  e.g. if I were to describe it in a sentence, I would say, Two guys get into a wreck, one leaves the scene illegally and inadvertently leaves an important document there, and he tries to get it back.  Yes I realize that this doesn't grasp the full plot, but it'll do for our purposes...Anyway, you could say as much as you wanted about the plot and not say anything about the theme.  The theme is more wrapped in Ben Affleck's monologues.  He acted quite well it seems to me, despite my own negative feelings toward the guy.  In other areas, it seems to me that Afflecks character is very interesting.  He is bent on not forging a second document, so he goes to all ends, to procure the original document, which wasn't legit in the first place.  Seems to me this is the them of the movie...the essence of human nature.  One one hand you have Gavin Banek, who, represents evil.  Not so much evil as just not good,  while Doyle Gibson....also represents the same not goodness...This true nature is most definitely interrupted by turns of goodness, such as when Doyle has the idea to return the file, or Gavin's discomfort with the whole idea of his affair and of the dishonesty of his firm. However the facts remain that Gavin seeks vengance on Doyle, and Doyle has a constant problem with his violent temper. Both of these are out of their respective exhibitor's control, and it is this that shows me that it is their true human nature.  In fact, Affleck's character becomes disillusioned with the rule of law.  The movie spans the depths of the hypocracy of the human mind.  Capable of infinite evil, and also of incredible conviction.

Well that got to me a bit here, and at various points throughout the film. I would look at the screen and think `What?'. So that feeling aside, and accepting what the characters were doing, I found that I wasn't sympathizing with either character, and hence didn't really care what was happening to them or why. The plotline of the major case, is so weak and never explained enough to give the viewer the gravity of the situation, that again you feel there's not a great issue here.

Successfully surpassing the elements of a standard thriller, the movie contains enough original and interesting content and evokes genuine compassion for, if not the characters, at least the situation. Easy to identify with, the themes of the film are ones to make you think, though the story is fairly simple.   It all starts with a minor traffic accident. A Wall Street Lawyer, Gavin Banek (Ben Affeleck) on his way to the courtroom, and a recovering alcoholic father, Doyle Gibson (Samuel L. Jackson) on his way to a custody hearing meet briefly after a fender bender. In a rush to make it to the hearing, Banek refuses to exchange insurance information and instead cuts Gibson a check and leaves him insulted and without a ride. This single incident sparks a chain of events that begins with Gibson missing his custody hearing and losing his wife and kids; and Banek making a fool of himself in court without an important document and signature. Guess what happened to that document... That's right, Sam's got it. The rest of the film takes place over the course of that same day as both men go to extraordinary lengths to try and salvage their individual situations. Banek must get that file, by any means necessary, or risk losing his job and possibly going to jail for fraud if he is unable to produce that signature. Gibson's close to rock bottom, and given how he was treated not quite so keen on giving back the file. Both men blame each other for the downward spiral the day their lives have entered, and push each other's buttons to the point of no return. Intense stuff, even if the action in the film is limited.  The movie works because not only is the situation believable and on a smaller scale identifiable, but the writing reflects equally believable behavior and dialogue. Written by Chap Taylor, his first credit as a screenwriter, I believe, and rewritten by Michael Tolkin (The Player) the foundation of the film is strong. Almost everything really good about Changing Lanes is because of the script. I suspect, in fact, that the original screenplay was probably even better, with more substance than the final product. I suspect a bit of trimming and compromise may not have helped, but it certainly didn't hurt much either. As I mentioned, the movie does work. Visually there were pros and cons. Sick of blatantly flashy and labored direction, I liked the simple, more traditional approach to the film. It was a bit flat, though, compared to some of the good stuff I've seen from the same director. It's not a movie to see if you're looking for pure eye candy, nor is it a movie I'd recommend if you're looking for a lot of action.Changing Lanes is a fairly engaging movie. A solid movie, that was much better than I expected and with a lot more to offer than the promos promise. This one came in under the radar, maybe a little too low. Possibly too much promotion may have done it more harm, because it's not a big summer movie that will please an adrenaline hungry audience; but it does deserve to get some attention. Good casting and good performances, even if neither are a stretch for the two leads. The movie has great supporting performances by William Hurt as Doyle Gibson's AA sponsor and especially the incredible Toni Collette as Banek's assistant and love interest (not to be confused with his wife). Above all a solid script deserves the most credit. Changing Lanes has been the first really pleasant surprise in a new film this year. "},{"Title":"BORING? what is this a thriller or  a drama?

Formulaic Hollywood flicks are beginning to really irritate me.  Maybe it is just old age.  This one feels like it was made for money ... period.  I will say that this may showcase the limit to Ben Affleck's acting ability, but I guess we are going to find out soon.  One of the previews at this film, was the new Tom Clancy movie with Affleck taking over for Harrison Ford as Jack Ryan.  Not exactly classic cinema, but it will be quite a test, maybe even a turning point, for Affleck.  Samuel L. Jackson always brings sincerity and intensity to his roles, and this is no exception.  He is just best utilized in roles with less screen time (i.e., Unbreakable, Pulp Fiction).  Lightweight Director Roger Michell (Notting Hill) does nothing to further his status - except maybe the opening credit sequence which is quite cool and unique.  One bright spot is Toni Collette (the mom from The Sixth Sense).  She is very intriguing and displays a wide array of emotion with seemingly very little effort. Oh yeah, Sydney Pollack does a nice job convincing us he is a naturally evil role model.  The story starts out promising, but quickly spins into the unbelievable and outlandish.  Subtlety could have made this quite the drama.  The whole thing with Affleck being ethically reborn made me want to puke.  No indication that this was ever even a twinkle prior to the incident.

Not surprisingly, it fails on all counts.I'd like to be nice and just say that it's an interesting idea that is just not done right.  But it's really not even that interesting the way it's presented.  A couple of New Yorkers on opposite ends of the monetary and social spectrum get into a car accident.  Without getting into the silly plot, the two proceed to get hell bent on destroying the others life.  These are not necessarily bad guys at heart, mind you; their dark sides are simply taking hold of them.  The film pretends to be different in the different things the characters do to each other throughout.  The problem is, the manner and style in which this different story is presented is no different than any other garden variety thriller to come out of Hollywood.  Standard character setup, accident/plot point, altercation, altercation, altercation, revelation, revelation, happy ending.  It's really not even this that I have such a problem with.  I only point it out because I find it laughable that so many moviegoers and film critics find this film to be so different and unconventional.  Perhaps if Christopher Nolan, Aronofsky, or the Coen brothers got a hold of it, it could be those things. The real problem I have with this film are the two lead actors, especially Ben Affleck.  Twenty minutes into this film, I knew that he was incapable of playing the character the way it should be played.  Affleck is the master of playing the smug, cocky and arrogant character.  But when any sort of emotion, depth, or other dimension of the character needs to come out, I always want to laugh Affleck right off the screen.  He's a BAD actor.  His sort of cheesy and one dimensional acting could cut it in soap operas, but it doesn't fly in feature films.  This character, despite the fact that he may inherently be good, has an evil and harmful side (as we all do) that comes out throughout the day.  Affleck plays that side of the character like he's playing a video game.  And since the whole film is dependent on the believable coming out of the evil sides of Affleck and Jackson, it fails when these two actors cannot deliver.While I think this role was way too much for Affleck, I think Jackson could have pulled it off.  He's shown a dark and desperate side in a number of films.  But in this one, I found him no more convincing than Affleck.  I really would have loved to see what Guy Pearce and Don Cheadle could have done with these characters.The actors are not helped at all by a terrible script (possible spoilers).  First of all, it's another one of those there's no way all that could happen in one day films.  Not just one day, but about 8 hours.  But it's the finer points of this script that make it so implausible as a whole.  Affleck offering a blank check?  Laughable.  No one is going to do that, except maybe Bill Gates.  The incredibly easy way in which Affleck obtains the truth about his partners involvement with the signature fraud?  I'm sure that in real life, such incriminating documents would be under lock and key, not in a file cabinet where anyone could access them.  I'm no expert on cars, but I would imagine that Affleck's Mercedes would have wheel locks to prevent someone (without the proper equipment) to remove or loosen his lugnuts.  It seemed as though every scene had some sort of incredibly ridiculous thing that lied at the center of it.And then there was the happy ending, which just didn't fit in with the dark tone of the film as a whole.  Ending with the somber revelations that Affleck and Jackson make near the end would have made the film much more gritty, socially conscious and realistic, like I think they intended it to be.  What had been a C- film up to that point fell to a D for me.The supporting cast was probably the only redeeming thing about this film.  Toni Collette quietly added another subtlely solid film to her repertoire, and I wanted to see more of her character.  Sydney Pollack always seems to pick his roles carefully, this one being no exception.  The noteable exception was the laughable performance (one scene, really) of Amanda Peet.  Too much.  No one talks or makes speeches like that.Usually, good films of this nature are independently made.  There's just too much money, too many egos and too may collaborators with a major studio film.  Somewhere along the way, the dark side of this film was lost.  And that is the essence of what this film should/could have been.  Better luck next time, Hollywood.

But if you wait a second here if you take the notion that this is one of those lame over the hill buddy flicks,then you are sadly mistaken. These men are primed to be enemies,meaning that,if by Hollywood standards ,one of them has to earn the brunt of our comtempt. This film however,is a rare bird and to me it is one of the rivetingest performances Samuel L. Jackson has done in recent years. This will be a sure Oscar contender for next year which basically steers clear of black and white by adorning itself in appealing shade of gray. A traffic accident on the FDR in New York sets off a chain reaction of events that finds them constantly trying to one-up each other in the dangerous game of long-reach implications. However,the movie progresses the push and pull tension not only between the characters but also between our own constantly striking allegations,and the picture itself doesn't squander its chance to just make a point about the need of people to take responsibility in this cold modern world. There is plenty of leaps for logic here as it refuses to pull no punches while at the same time it doesn't go overboard with some movies to had to just go by the same repulsive formula genre. As for Ben Affleck's performance here,this is a far cry for his recent works(whose last good film was the WWII epic Pearl Harbor)and it shows a tremendous makeover that he his acting skills spiced(and just to make a point here lets hope he can get better scripts like this one too,instead of the lame groupie poo that he's signing up for in the past).

Afleck looks the part of a 30-year-old lawyer on the brink of being corrupted by his father-in-law (Pollack) and his slinky, Lady MacBeth type of wife.  Jackson, heavier, more stolid than in earlier films, is fine as the ex-alcoholic insurance man who is going to lose his wife and children because the accident delayed his arrival at court.That accident starts off a train of consequences that constitute a test for both parties.  In fact, there's an undertone of religion in the movie. Afleck shouts at a priest in the confessional.  A crucifix dangles jumpingly from the rear-view mirror of Jackson's taxi.  The sequence of events unfolds like an illustration of chaos theory with more and more hateful and drastic actions following from an overdependence of initial conditions.  They seem inevitable, given the spiteful, grasping nature of Afleck's and Jackson's characters.There are a few weaknesses in the script.  Afleck seems to change his mind about how to handle Jackson from one minute to the next without any clear logical substrate.  And the happy ending seems tacked on, redemption for the lawyer, a feebly earned family reunion for the insurance guy.Kim Staunton, as Jackson's wife, is outstanding.  She not only gives a fine performance but looks the part of a middle-aged woman with two children, desperate to start life over again, with a new and better version of Jackson, perhaps somewhere in Oregon.  Her face has features that linger in the mind.  It would have been so easy to throw some knockout younger woman into the role -- Vanessa Williams, say, or Naomi Campbell, I don't know. It's to the credit of the producers that they resisted the temptation. Amanda Pays, as Afleck's wife, is equally memorable if for different reasons.  (Wow.)  But both women are faced with tough roles.  Staunton must decide that Jackson is right for her after all.  (Why?)  And Pays, who has earlier urged Afleck to commit fraud and whatever else is necessary to maintain their uptrodden life styles, isn't the kind of woman who's going to settle for some longhair who does a lot of pro bono.  (She turned down a previous boyfriend who was a Professor of Middle English at Princeton because he wasn't good enough.  She wanted a hard-charging Wall Street lawyer.  So much for American values.)There are two set speeches in the script, too, about looking at another girl on the beach or passing someone on the street, and wondering what would have happened if you'd said hello, that weakly echoe Mister Bernstein's marvelous anecdote in Citizen Kane about the girl on the Hoboken ferry -- a white dress she had on.But it's really encouraging to see a movie like this being financed and produced and hitting the screen.  It's never going to be a blockbuster. Everyone involved must have known that.  And yet they took a chance on a low-key movie without superstars, dealing with ordinary people, without the cloying charm that is so often slathered on to movies about ordinary people. Three punches are thrown and there are two car accidents and that wraps up the action.  No explosions.  No slow motion.  Come to think of it, that last accident, when the wheel rolls off Afleck's car and the rim slams onto the pavement in a shower of spark -- that's exactly what happened to me in a 1937 Ford in the middle of the Holland Tunnel when I was a teenager, but that's neither here nor there.  I'm happy too that race is no more important here than it was in White Men Can't Jump.  Jackson isn't an African-American insurance guy.

Questions of right and wrong and absolute right versus a balance of goodness over badness are cursorily tackled, but ultimately dismissed in a rather simplistic way. Affleck has a minor road accident with an insurance salesman. Attempting to resolve it rather abruptly, he sparks off a train of events that lead from bad to worse. Neither character is blameless, and there is ample room for a certain amount of soul-searching that is traditionally absent from American movies, but even this is appearance over substance, for once the audience is hooked on the difficulty of the dilemma it is solved by a white-man-saves-the-world that is worryingly and unintentionally black and white in more ways than one.

Jackson's Doyle doesn't follow the character's development either. He is meant to be a regular guy who is just trying to do the right thing. Why then does he do the wrong thing? His soon-to-be or already ex-wife (this was a little confusing in the movie.) is about the least believable female character I've ever seen. We first meet her at a court date Gavin has missed. She seems unreasonable and shrewish. Then towards the end of the movie she is understanding and sympathetic then a few minutes later she is unbelievably enraged and becomes vindictive. About the only plausible character in this entire movie is William Hurt as Doyle's sponsor. He is quiet and does the only true-to-life thing in the movie. He says that Doyle is a drama queen and is only creating this turmoil for the sake of turmoil. All too true. As a part of the movie-going public I demand that a character in a drama and/or thriller have some motivation behind his actions. In Changing Lanes all any character does is act or react to move the thin plot along. This is a poorly written, and heavy-handed movie. I would not recommend it to any one.

It is one of the most important movies in the last 10 years.Firstly it's in the script. The good story, the good situations, the main characters, the 24 hours plot, and the intelligent harmonization between the social satire and the fast pace; like we're watching a very attractive action movie but with a lot of serious things to say.I loved the good meaning of Changing Leans when you suddenly have the ability to review and reexamine everything; your behaviors, feelings, thoughts, ideals, so what you believe in, and your relationships with the others. In brief, reexamine you, everybody and everything around you, to make the decision  What way do you want to walk into ? It's excellent idea to turn away accidentally from your ordinary familiar road to stop a little, get in touch with new people and new experiences, and win a powerful knowledge. A knowledge which would learn you a lot about the world and yourself in it; like having the power to revolt against falseness, opportunism, corruption and manipulation by law; as for (Ben Affleck), and suffering from addiction of nervousness, anarchism and anything makes us lost love; as for (Samuel L. Jackson).Actually the movie was about to be perfect. I must mention the scene in which (Affleck) is trying to make up a fire in the company to get the opportunity to be alone in it. Just WAW ! This short yet dexterous sequence just condenses the unique quality of the whole movie. It was well written, filmed, edited.. etc. I loved the metaphor of it; as (Affleck) himself was the real fire by his anger. And being the virtuous pure one, by uncovering the corruption, made him the conflagration and the fire fighter in the same superb time.The thing that I hated the most in that clever script was the abrupt idealistic attitude of (Affleck) in the very end (the restaurant scene) whereas it's so difficult to believe that revolutionary move when he forced his boss / that influential old fraud to admit the robbery ! (Affleck) compelled the man to return 3 million dollars to its original owners so simply, so easily, to provocative extent !! Moreover, I didn't like the performance of (Affleck) which was &#x96; as always &#x96; too icy and shallow. But no wonder, because he got such a lame charisma and flat apathetic face which by the way gave his role its shape but not its depth. Not to forget his weak way of diction; for instance the scene when he was threatening (Jackson) by bankruptcy in a phone call. And what a bad luck (Affleck) had when he got the chance to act in front of a formidable talent as well as charisma like (Samuel L. Jackson). Undoubtedly (Jackson) delivered a performance which could present his human momentum's essence plainly. Therefore the movie unfortunately has that irony of a master and a rocky rookie as 2 leads. It's a paradox that really enrages me when they put (Affleck)'s name before (Jackson)'s on the credits !(Changing Lanes) has the best. Great plot, hot drama, good meaning, all tightly made as a thriller. The only 2 mistakes though is having (Affleck), and having (Affleck) in front of (Jackson) !

How an ordinary incident such as an insignificant car accident leads to complete turmoil in a person's life. The loss of an important document sets off a mechanism of hate and vengeance in both Affleck and Jackson that lasts approximately 24 hours. The theme is a modern version of Kafka with the identical elements of frustration and despair. The problem here however is that the rivalry between the two antagonists is not really convincing. Apart from the insignificant event that brought them together there is no real profound bond between the rivals that justifies the extreme measures they are prepared to take. The fact that both individuals are never really convinced of the legitimacy of their acts and are constantly prone to a sense of guilt is detrimental to the dramatic tension. Affleck does not get a real grip on his role and it is difficult to sympathize with Jackson as the down and out but nevertheless well-intentioned individual. The final scenes where both individuals renew their faith in life in an all's well that ends well fashion is both artificial and clumsily moralizing.

It shows a resourceful, rich, powerful Manhattan Laweyer powerless against a poor, divorced, former alcoholic, failed suburbs sales-man.Even the build-up of the plot from the car crash is totally deceitful. Things don't work this way. Not even close. A successful and responsible lawyer would hold very tight to a document that is worth *so* much. At least as tight as not to just drop it. This and the rest of the lawyer's actions simply blow character consistency. Like a poor man will be very happy to accept a blank check and not want to do things right like it is shown in the movie.These are just a few examples. There are so many others (most of which are desire-gratifications) that it would serve no purpose to enumerate them.Moving past the form of the film, to the essence. The movie's message is that being disrespectful or even refusing to acknowledge (as a being) even the most insignificant and ignorable person will result in all hell breaking loose (even if you are a decent person otherwise). No arguments are presented to argue this claim. It is simply stated. Reality is the perfect opposite. This is the reason most of the movie is desire gratification. It is meant to make people who feel insignificant, abandoned, useless, etc. feel important.The movie got 4 and not 1 because the settings are individualistic, characters speak one at a time, there are little or no scenes with pets (or one big happy family), small children or other clique cuts.

What's most interesting is the fact that it is set over the period of one day. This greatly adds to the intensity that it intends to create. But best is the sheer engagement of it all. As one action leads to an even tougher consequence, you feel utterly compelled to find out what happens next.This is all well and good, but the close attention to detail is surprising to see. The extras that appear on the streets and in the courthouse actually look like real people. They're not wearing make-up or dressed up in a fancy way, they're just normal people on a supposedly normal day. I must warn you, the less you know about the plot, the better. The `you scratch my back' motto is what goes along with the film and if you know to much about the plot, then you'll probably be bored for the first or so.Brilliant acting from the two leads aswell as the large supporting cast. The two main characters are your average stereotypes; the vain hotshot lawyer and the recovering alcoholic/ sour tempered divorcee. But Ben Affleck and Samuel L. Jackson both bring human qualities to these roles to show more depth to their shallow exteriors. As the day goes on, their demeanours are gradually melted away, and both actors show this with the greatest expertise. Toni Collette doesn't get much conviction but does what she can with role (ditto Sydney Pollack). Kim Staunton is adequate as Jackson's bitter ex-wife.

The fun starts when high-powered attorney Banek, late for a high-profile court battle, crisscrosses lanes, smacking into Gibson, a recovering alcoholic on his way to the same courthouse to gain parental rights to his children.  Banek desperately needs to submit a signed form to the court that proves an elderly millionaire turned over his organization to Banek's law firm, while Gibson must show he has been approved for a loan to buy a house for his family, ultimately keeping his family together in New York.  Unbeknownst to one another, they inadvertently ruin one another's chances that day, which brings out the worst in them and, eventually, the best.  The whole thing is like a mature, thinking-man's `Spy vs. Spy,' or `Tom & Jerry The Next Generation,' as it transcends the typical, vengeance-meets-street justice theme that characteristically makes films like this so unbearable.  As the two adversaries look deep inside themselves and begin to change, it seems authentic, unlike the average Tom Cruise vehicle (where he routinely loses it all, causing him to reflect, causing him to win it all back and do the right thing. yawn!).Samuel Jackson, sporting a old-timey mustache, is pretty good in his role, as is Affleck.  Typically, Affleck is a horrible actor, but this role must hit close to home for him, as he pulls it off with mucho artistry (need I mention Reindeer Games or Dogma to back me up?).  Jackson again plays Samuel L Jackson, thorny black man, just as he has since Pulp Fiction in films like Unbreakable, The Negotiator, Sphere, Jackie Brown, even The Phantom Menace, though he seems a bit more human here.  On the other side of the fence, Toni Collete (who plays Michelle) needs bigger Hollywood roles, while Amanda Peet, as Cynthia Banek, is truly wasted talent here.Creating one of the greatest rhetorical titles in recent history (it works on so many different levels in this film), director Roger Mitchell, who won't win any humanitarian awards, makes the viewer question his/her belief systems by interjecting an almost misanthropic awareness of the human race, Wall Street ethics, wealth, religion, law, and the sanctity of marriage (there are about 300 close-up shots of wedding-rings) through symbolism, parallels and dialogue.  Mitchell generates an uniform playing field built upon frustration and desperation, asking, `Despite monetary status, religion, education, and intelligence, aren't we all just wild animals when cornered?'

It was one of those movies where I could stop it at anytime and do other stuff like go swimming, wash my clothes, etc and not care what I will miss or that I have it on pause. To me it was a disappointment, but by the look of the average rating it is receiving, looks like the majority give it a thumbs up. Two thumbs down!

As usual Samuel L. Jackson was great and Ben Affleck was good too.  But besides the acting, I thought this film left a lot to be desired.  I give it a 2/10.  I would give it a one but the acting was good so that's why it got a 2 for my vote.

Now, that would OK in some stories, but in Changing Places, it is very painfully obvious. The ending will leave a lot of people with a warm fuzzy feeling, but you can see it coming...

Most every event was predictable and/or implausible.

Put both feet down and RUN from this waste of a few thousand feet of celluloid (do they still use that stuff?).Mister Jackson has done some fine work (the reason I went to see this movie).

But I had high hopes for this movie and was let down big time. There was hardly any character development; just enough to give you an idea of what was going on but not enough to sympathize or understand why they reacted the way they did. Also, the movie took too long to end. The ways they insisted on getting back at each other became old and predictable. The ending was too Brady Bunch for my taste. I suppose when you see it you'll understand what I mean. Also, it seemed like every other word out of their mouths was some moral lesson that we should all take home with us. I don't go to the movies to get lectured, I go to get entertained. Like I said, I was really disappointed with this movie. Samuel L Jackson and Ben Affleck have done better performances as well. They didn't seem like they were into it. It was a story idea that had potential but eventually got flushed down the drain.

This is not an action movie!  Nor is it even an interesting drama.  Changing Lanes takes 2 hours (which actually feels more like 4) to tell a mediocre story at best, that could have been told in 20 minutes.  The proverbial horse gets beaten over and over again and just when you think this tedious film is finally over, they whip out the stick and beat it three or four more times.  I'm sure that all the wannabe film students out there are drooling over the quasi-indy film feel to some of the cinematography.  And for those who feel that good films only show the ugly realities of life, this film delivers, that is, if you can stay awake long enough to see it all the way through. Affleck gives a decent performance and Jackson does an admirable job with a shallow script treatment of his character, but it just wasn't enough to carry this film for me.  Bottom line, if you go, bring a pillow.

Ben Affleck's high-flying lawyer and Samuel L. Jackson's recovering alcoholic get into a car crash with each other; Affleck delays Jackson (who thus misses a hearing to determine custody of his children); but is himself inconvenienced after accidentally giving Jackson a crucial file of his. Jackson doesn't feel inclined to give it back, Affleck tries to pressure him to do so; and the two men end up sucked into a cycle of increasingly serious revenge. This might make for a sprightly comedy, but unfortunately, this movie is deadly serious, and both men come across as pompous and dull on a journey that leads to a very predictable form of reconciliation and personal discovery. This sort of scenario needs to be handled with a bit of zim, not with self-importance. Frankly, I found it very hard to care.

They met at the courthouse to...erhm, I think Afflick wanted to adopt some kids or something. And then a piece of paper got lost and there was this old actor I've seen in movies before when he still took acting seriously. The end. I think.....All jokes aside, Changing Lanes is not thé worst movie ever made. far from it even. But with the talent involved, (acting, directing and catering) such a flimsy storyline should have never been put to film.After a good 45 minutes the little plot they made up, had already been laid out and the movie just continues reluctantly to fill the other promised 45 minutes. These last 45 minutes are basically nothing more than a meagre tale about good vs. evil which was superficial to the point of being banal. And then that ending; the parody of happy endings to end all parodies of happy endings? It made my head spin from the kick in the teeth.Not only was the story flimsy and hackneyed, it was breathtakingly implausible. To list but a phew utterly unbelievable situations -You're in a real hurry to get somewhere very important, your car crashes and then u don't even try to see if the car still runs but in stead try to hitchhike to certain overduement? - You pay good money to freeze someone's assets to force him to give u something u need. The guy you just bankrupted sells you a simple no and then you instantly come crawling back on your hands and knees in remorse and regret? - If you need someone to be bankrupted completely and have it done fast, you simply call some guy and he will make it happen within three minutes without breaking a sweat and on top of that only asks 5.000 Dollars for it? And the number for this guy is given to you by your secretary? The list really just goes on and on.I can't say anyone in particular (besides Sydney Pollack who, due to retirement, had his assistant phone it in) did a bad job at acting.

Not that it comes as a big surprise), with the frequent school-boy down staring when he's supposed to be given a life lesson. Much like Tom Cruise in The Firm, inexpressive Ben Affleck, with his parasite attitude in life and on the screen, is totally miscast. He should just stick to the portraying comic book - characters, where nobody is necessarily looking for a good acting performance, and while we're at it, wear the mask, too.It's more comfortable for the audience not to see his big insipid face.
