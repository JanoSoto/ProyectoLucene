Having been an avid fan of the entire series of Flowers in the Attic books, I knew there was a strong possibility the film would do nothing but irritate me by way of poor acting and even poorer script-writing. What I didn't realise, was how much of a massacre the film was going to make of such a beautifully written book.First off, and I'm sorry - but it is a shallow comment to make Those kids; Chris, Cathy, Carrie and Cory are supposed to be stunning. The Dresden dolls because they are *that* striking. Whoever cast the film seemed to have sorted through the Village of the Damned rejects in order to find the two youngest (scariest looking couple of children I have ever seen) Chris was, I'm sorry - just nothing like the original character and while Kristy Swansen is very pretty - she just didn't cut it as Cathy.Which brings me to my next point - Cathy's thing is ballet - she's an excellent dancer - and aside from a couple of pathetic scenes involving Swansen trying to get her leg higher than her hip-bone, they ignored the one thing that the entire character centres around.And just out of interest - where was the relationship between Cathy and Chris? I know having an incestuous relationship played out in film has got to be controversial - but don't bother even picking up a pen to write a script for a story if you have absolutely no intention of keeping the central story-lines. And if you do, don't have the audacity to pass it off as the film version of a highly acclaimed book just by giving it the same title.Flowers in the Attic was based on a true story. (As stated in the prologue of the copy I have anyway). How - HOW is it OK to just butcher such an awesome piece of work? It's like passing Pokemon off as the Mona-Lisa; sick and entirely wrong. They have completely missed the point of the story It wasn't about 4 kids sitting in an attic waiting to die or be let out; it was about four children adapting to a situation wherein they have to become adults long before their time. It was about how the relationships between the siblings evolved, and the psychological consequences of losing one parent through death and another through greed.For anyone who has watched the film and is ready to dismiss the books because of it - seriously; don't be fooled by such an obvious lacklustre attempt at a book adaptation. There are not enough words in the English language to explain how wrong this film is - how utterly and completely pathetic the script, setting, acting, casting, directing and the 101 other ways in which the movie sucks beyond belief.And just... just don't get me started on the ending. Every time I think about it I just want to do nasty things involving pointy objects to the script-writer.Please tell me someone agrees with me?

And when it is stripped off that, it becomes a story that easily you and me or any John Doe could write. Flowers in the Attic, written by Virginia Andrews, is a gripping tale of broken trust, betrayal, and complex human relationships that seem so natural under the circumstances, however forbidden they were to be. It's such a pity that such a novel should fall in wrong hands for its screen adaptation. The movie horribly lacks the original soul of the story, its sinister twists, its surprises, its adventures in sociology.The story is like this after their father dies accidentally, Corrine, the mother, takes pre-pubertal Chris, Cathy and little twins Cory and Carrie to her own wealthy parents hoping she would inherit from his dying father. But there's a catch; her marriage had been earlier disapproved by the old man and he won't let her a penny if he finds out she has children. So she and the equally cruel grandmother lock the kids up in the attic... until the fine moment comes when she'd win the old man's heart back and tell her everything. But that day never comes while Corrine herself marries another man and eventually inherits the money... without telling her father about the children. In the meantime, Chris and Cathy grow up through teens and discover each other quite fruitfully, and eventually all four of them become a family, sharing a special bond made out of the feeling of being betrayed, and the longing to escape, which occurs not before three years.The movie changed a lot of it. Some I didn't mind, but some are really outrageous. The account of mental and physical growth of the children during the course of time is largely left out. The movie shows Chris and Cathy in late teens right from the start, which ruined the basic message behind their relationship. In the book the twins played an enormous role in building up that relationship between their older siblings. The movie did not treat them as characters, to put it flatly. And how the movie ends, it may look dramatic in a rather happy-ending manner, but comparing to the book, it is overtly exaggerated, giving the whole thing a cheap smell. The book's climax is not dramatic, yet far more thrilling than this crap about the kids meeting their new stepfather. And finally this sick hush-hush about the incest! Somebody who liked the movie considered the brilliant plot of the novel just an excuse to write about incest, and told me it's good how the movie avoided the details. Nonsense! incest in this story comes as the most natural thing on earth. And how wonderfully indifferent Andrews is when she writes about it, the storyteller being Cathy. The movie blandly leaves a large part of it out, making the whole movie seem, well, infertile.For the casting, only Louis Fletcher made a great grandmother. She is right there in her Oscar-winning standard. But besides her, it's all a bad casting throughout. Kristy Swanson as Cathy is just disgusting. How can she act so blunt when she's the central character? Jeb Adams as Chris may not look like he's described, but he acts not that bad. And Victoria Tennant as Corrine too, receives little screen time to be judged well.I wish there hadn't been a movie. You cannot make an art movie through three years, and you can't easily show a 13-year-old girl naked performing incest, both of which are absolutely necessary to make a good screen adaptation out of the story. But I don't want this crap to be remembered as the only movie out of Andrews' novel. I now want a remake, however controversial it may be, whatever ratings it may get.

Andrews, centers around a widowed mother (Victoria Tennant) who decides to whisk her four children off to live with their grandparents in their isolated mansion. The children consist of Chris, Cathy, and the two younger children, Cory and Carrie. Little do the children know, their mother has essentially given them over to their abusive, religiously-fanatical grandmother (played by Oscar winner Louise Fletcher), and they are locked away in the attic and kept there, while their health deteriorates and they are abused constantly. All the while, their evil mother conspires to receive the inheritance from her own dying father, and plans on starting a completely new life with another man - even if it means murder.A decent but semi-disturbing film, Flowers In The Attic is a strange movie. Keep in mind I haven't read the novel that the film was based upon, so I have no reference between the two (although I've heard numerous times that the film did the book not an ounce of justice). So, without comparing the film and the novel, I thought this movie was pretty effective. The storyline is nicely written here, it's an obscure plot for sure. The script was decent as well, and again I'm not sure how it correlates with the original book. Atmosphere and claustrophobia is consistent in the film as well, it isn't your typical bloody horror flick. Everything has a very Gothic, depressing tone, and the mood here fits everything very well. It's an eerie film, mainly because of the disturbing subject matter and the gloomy atmosphere that is present throughout. The film deals with some heavy issues as well (including incest, among other things), so you may want to be aware of that.As far as the acting goes here, I thought it was very good. Louise Fletcher (who garnered an Oscar for her stunning performance in the film classic One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest) is terrifying in her performance as the abusive, psychotic grandmother of the children. As if her character isn't scary enough, Fletcher is a very tall woman as well, and her stature and attitude adds to the menacing nature of her character. I thought she carried the film in way of the performances and more notable than the others, but everyone else was good here too. A young Kristy Swanson plays the eldest daughter Cathy, and Victoria Tennant plays the manipulative and evil mother of the four kids. The ending of the film consisted of some good old bittersweet revenge, it's definitely one of those endings that you're likely to remember.Overall, Flowers In The Attic is a good movie. I haven't read the novel, so I don't personally know how it compares to the book. Based on other reviews here, the book apparently blows the film away, but since I've yet to read it, I'm just judging my review on the film alone. It's a decent psychological Gothic horror story about abuse, abandonment, human relationships, and revenge. Personally I thought it was an alright film, and worth watching if it sounds like your cup of tea (although, judging from what I've heard, if you've read the novel, you may be disappointed with it). 6/10.

In fact, the opposite seems to be true. Having not read the book, I first saw this movie unjaded, and so was able to appreciate it as the sad and tragic story that it is.The sudden death of a loving husband and father (it appears he may be a little too loving toward the oldest daughter, but the movie doesn't expand on that) leaves the family in despair, so the mother takes the children and herself to her filthy-rich parents' mansion, hoping to inherit the estate from her dying father. Just one little thing she was long-ago disinherited because she entered into a forbidden marriage, and her father will not grant her an inheritance if he knows the marriage resulted in children, so she and her mother, The Grandmother, keep the children hidden in an attic as they await the old man's death, and she tries to win back his approval. The Grandmother is like a cruel warden, treating the children, a teenage boy and girl, and two young twins, boy and girl, like convicted criminals, only worse. The waiting goes on and on, during which the mother is consumed by greed, and emerges as the real villain.Some readers of the book are indignant that the story was cleaned up for the movie, but that was necessary to make it more watchable to a wider audience. It is still a great and haunting story, reminiscent of the black and white horror flicks of the 1960's (Whatever Happened To Baby Jane, Hush Hush, Sweet Charlotte, etc.). Audiences of the 1980's were not so jaded as today's, and were not ready for incest, especially among sympathetic characters.Maybe the acting was not first-rate, and some elements, like the climactic ending, a bit campy, but the compelling storyline easily compensates for it, so long as you don't dwell on the few shortcomings, and can't see the forest for the trees.And the movie has one thing the book hasn't a memorably haunting, chilling musical score, a perfect compliment to an equally haunting, chilling story.

The characters leapt off the page and the situations were memorable.This film, I'm sorry to say, is feeble and doesn't get even halfway near to doing justice to Virginia Andrews' work.  As the key character, Cathy, Kirsty Swanson is all wrong, while her siblings Chris, Carrie, and Cory (played by Jeb Stuart Adams, Lindsay Parker, and Ben Ryan Ganger) don't engage the interest.  Perhaps the most interesting character in the film is Corrine, their mother, played by Victoria Tennant, and given a bit of characterisation.I just think the material is pretty unfilmable without it veering into pseudo-porn or just becoming a catalogue of violence.

Andrews southern Gothic horror novel into a made-to-teens movie. A film like this cannot be a P.G. film. If you even read a part of the book you'll know why. That's why today I'm going to give you a brief run down of the movie so you wont be tempted to watch this piece of garbage. A hot mom and her four bratty kids have to leave their suburban home because the bread winner (i.e. Pop's) is killed in a traffic accident. Pop's and the daughter have a very bizarre relationship (shown briefly with Mum spying on the two). Pop's dies on his birthday leaving the family to fend for themselves. When the money runs out, the five of them move into a dreary mansion that's ran by a cruel grandmother, a butler who resembles a young and spry Ronald W. Reagan and a basket case on wheels who looks like Mr. Steptoe. After being cleansed of her sins the ancient way (involving a scourging bull whip). The mother has to put her kids into an attic room while Mister Steptoe eh.. the Grandfather dies. While they wait, the children must live chaste lives and live out the days inside a musty and moldy attic. Chirs and Cathy (the older kids in their budding years) must fight temptation and (oops that's the book) they must become the most stupid and obnoxious children they can become. Grandmother berates them and calls them sinners and what not. The youngest of the brood the twins Corey and Carrie are even more unsympathetic than the older sibs.Pretty soon the food stops coming and Mum only makes cameo appearances. The child have nothing to eat (expect when Chris plays Jesus and feeds the wee ones his blood. If you think the movie can't get more ridiculous, it does. While the children starve, Mum courts a middle aged mullet wearing suitor. When she finally visits the kids, the ungrateful children lash out at their benefactor and she makes a hasty exit. The day of judgment comes when they learn three things, one Corey is dead, two Gramps is dead and three Mum's gonna get married!After stealing enough money, the kids get the courage to leave their room in the attic. After Chris puts the smack down on grandma and avoid lurch err I mean Ronnie err the butler, they run right into the middle of the wedding ceremony. Daughter confronts the jealous mother and a brief chase turns into tragedy. Mum hangs herself with her long veil. How ironic she wore white. As the three leave the mansion, the narrator promises more to come!Thankfully this movie sank like the Bismark at the box office. No more book-to-film adaptations for V.C. Andrews (who died during the post production, probably due to watching the dailies whilst she was on the set). A shame about the movie because if it was done correctly, we could have saw the whole series on film. But when you cheap out and use a hack to write and direct, you get garbage on the screen.Not recommended.I wouldn't watch this movie again on a dare or a bet. Well, maybe if it was worth my while.xxx "},{"Title":"Four dumb children are imprisoned in an attic.","Date":"31 December 2006","Score":"13 out of 18 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama, Mystery, Thriller","Review":" Morons In The Attic.

Even worse, while in other movies of this sub-genre the prisoner(s) can't leave because they are well guarded, in this story the four kids could have left any time! And they don't, in spite of starvation, boredom, decreasing health and the hatred of the grandmother - all because they implicitly trust their mother and her plans. They are just oh-so naive... Their mother, without any explanation, becomes a psychopath who poisons her own children! This piece of garbage would have us believe that four beautiful children can be the result of a marriage between a woman and her blood-uncle! And then there is all that total naivety and innocence that this unrealistic foursome ooze out of their every pore - as if the two older ones had been raised in an attic before they ended up in the house of their grandmother/great-aunt.

V.C. Andrews book, when I read it myself wasn't that bad, actually it was very good! Sadly as in most cases the movie just wasn't as good as the book.The story revolves around a family who at one time was very happy indeed. However as this movie shows they hit hard times. I won't say how because that would give away major plot points for you. After these unhappy turn of events they, I mean the four children and their mother, all have to return in poverty and destitution to their grandmother's home for help. The mother has a plan to win back her father's love to inherit a fortune the likes the kids had never dreamed. When the group enters the grounds of the ornate mansion we are treated to the main villain of the movie....Grandmother, and her bodyguard/servant John The Butler. Needless to say Grandmother is less than thrilled to see her daughter after umpteen years and bringing four unwanted Spawn of the Devil with her. This, sadly is what she refers to them as.Grandmother, as she is called is played wonderfully by Louise Fletcher. Granted I'm a fan of Kristy Swanson, but this is a movie made before she really got good roles such as Buffy. However this movie has only Mrs. Fletcher to lean back upon as the ONLY person who really CAN act.Grandmother makes life hell for the children, and punishes the mother for leaving with her husband years earlier. Eventually Mother as she is referred to tells the children of an attic above their room. For months they use this place to escape the harsh reality around them. As time continues pressing on they realize Mother doesn't love them as much as they had originally thought, and decide its time once and for all to make a break for it.The movie is very depressing, and I think this is what the film is supposed to do. I believe the director wanted you to feel as they did, hopeless and trapped in that attic as the kids were. For that I give it a 5/10, because in some areas it does succeed, and Mrs. Fletcher's acting really does get you angry at her character. Otherwise I count off for bad-acting, scenes which made no sense at times, and plot points which were utterly useless (the list of rules which was never expounded upon, certain other key moments as well) if you watch you'll understand what I mean. Also the time frame for which these events took place also seem out of order, which if I remember correctly were very detailed in the book.To me its good for a one time watch but there are better movies which succeed at doing what this one tries to do. I re-watched it the other day and remembered it being very good when I was younger. However now it seems more like a straight-to-video diatribe which I could've easily bypassed completely.

It seemed interesting enough and one day when it came on TV I recorded it and decided to watch it later that night. Now, maybe I was just not expecting much from it, but I absolutely loved it the first time I watched it. Then, I realized it was based on a book. Not long ago I finished the book, and when I look back this movie kind of did not do it justice at all. There was tons of material that was left out and though I like the ending in the movie better than the ending in the book, I thought the book was much more mystifying and eerie. The thing about the movie though is it's entertaining enough on it's own to where I still really enjoy it and the characters are well adapted and played out by the actors and actresses. The movie maintains some eeriness and has a nice, creepy atmosphere, but now I just wish that there was so much more they would've done with the movie.I guess since I'm not a huge fan of the book, it doesn't really upset me that the movie fails to do it justice, but I really do wish there would be another movie adaptation where it's rated R and they include tons of more important material.

It was trash but it was GOOD trash. It involves a happy family--a mom, a dad and four kids. The father dies and the mother rapidly runs out of money. She has no choice to ask her parents (who disapproved of the marriage) for help. Her mother agrees but tells her that her children must stay up in the attic--her father doesn't know about them and, if he did, he wouldn't help her. The kids are in the attic for THREE YEARS. And, over time, one of the brothers discovers his sister...and the grandmother tortures them almost daily. Those were the big selling points of the book...the incest and kids being tortured. It does have a happy ending though (sort of).I was one of the lucky ones who actually saw this at a theatre back in 1987. The studio snuck it out quietly--I found out why. First, the story was changed. They wanted a PG-13 rating so there's no incest at all--not even suggested. The tortures their grandmother puts them through were softened or eliminated entirely. They aren't up there for three years. And they completely changed the ending (although it WAS great to see the mother get it at the end). All the changes drained the story of any impact it might have had. Acting didn't help--Louise Fletcher is LOUSY as the evil grandmother; Victoria Tennant was even worse as the mother; Kristy Swanson as the oldest daughter overplayed her role a LOT. Only Jeb Stuart Adams as her brother gave a halfway good performance. It was no great piece of acting but pretty OK.To be fair to the movie, a faithful adaptation of the book would probably be way too grim for a movie (and get an NC-17 rating) but diluting it completely AND adding lousy acting isn't the way to go! Boring, stupid, illogical...a total waste. This deserves a 0. I'm really surprised that some people LIKE this movie!

It certainly wasn't the worst movie I have ever seen, but it's down there. The events that transpire throughout the course of the film stay true to V.C. Andrews' novel, in some ways.  Four siblings are locked in the northern wing of their grandparents' house by their selfish mother and sadistic grandmother after the death of their father has left the family in debt.  The movie does open up before Daddy's death, and there is even a scene where the oldest daughter, Cathy, is given a music box by her beloved father, just like in the book.  However, the relationship between Cathy and her father seems almost irrelevant to the whole feel of the movie, from what I can remember, because unlike in the book, their relationship is not developed well, not much beyond that one scene in fact.  And there were sequels to the book that were able to expand on the effects Chris Sr.'s death had on Cathy, especially seen through her incestuous relationship with her brother, which was cut out of the movie.  Then there is the night of the father's birthday party (only in the movie, there are no guests), and the family is waiting for him to come home from work.  He never does.  Instead, a couple of police officers show up at the door. Cathy screams. Cut to Cathy and Chris in a bus (was it a bus? In the book, they were in a train), on their way to their grandmother's house, or rather, mansion.  Blah blah blah.  The kids arrive, are locked away in a northern room, and that's where they stay for the next few years.  You have to pardon me.   I know all about the book.  I know it by heart.  But I haven't seen this movie for years so I don't remember exactly how long they were imprisoned in the film.  In the book, it was like 3 years, four months and 16 days.    In the closet of this sequestered room, there are stairs leading up to the attic where they often like to play, and where Cathy practices ballet.   Cathy and her brother Chris do not go on to have a love affair, though, like they did in the book.  Yet there is still plenty of abuse.  Besides the obvious fact that they are being locked away from the world, the grandmother also cuts Cathy's beautiful hair and slaps the children and stuff.  And Chris and Cathy do like to take baths with the other one watching.  The ending is the worst part of this movie.   It strays far from the book's conclusion.  It goes for sensation, unlike V.C. Andrews, whom I think knew what she was doing when she had the story end the way it did. She also left room for a sequel.  Jeff Bloom really didn't. I read that there was talk of a sequel, but they never got around to it.  I'm glad.  Petals on the Wind was my favorite in the series, and the rest were really good too, better than the original because the characters were more complex.  I shudder to think of what would have been done to them in a film adaptation.   Overall, this is not a movie worth seeing.  Fans of the book will most likely be disappointed, and those who haven't read it probably won't like it much either.  I don't know quite why the movie failed to live up to the book.  Well, no movie seems to, just by principle, with rare exceptions.  On top of that, the acting wasn't very good, though Kristy Swanson does look like Cathy would.  Though perhaps that's because I originally bought the movie tie-in copy of the book, and the kids on the cover were modeled after the actors.  There certainly was a vague resemblance between Cathy, Chris and their younger brother Cory, twin of Carrie, on the cover and the actors who played them.   On some of the movie covers, it shows the illustrated picture from the book cover.  It is cool.  It shows four kids standing in the attic doorway as if they are prepared to enter a dangerous other world, looking scared. The main failure though is probably that the way V.C. Andrews wrote the book cannot be duplicated by any director or screenwriter.  And the prologue was ten times better than Cathy's voice-over during the opening credits.  But mainly, this is the kind of story to be read, especially since I feel that V.C. Andrews was a much better writer than most people give her credit for being, most of all this movie, which by the way, she had a cameo in.  She was a window-washer. So if you want the story, read the book. Read the whole series, if you want.  I gave the first four books very high ratings on Amazon, though they disturbed me greatly, and in a way, I hate them for that.  And it takes a lot to disturb me. Forget this.  I give it a 3 out of ten.

As much as the content off the book and the film is quite disturbing, and some scenes were slightly graphic, it was not as much a horror as it was just a sad tale. A sad tale of four beautiful children kept from the world in a dingy attic. And although it wasn't frightening in the least (and horror's are the genre I watch the most and love), I absolutely loved the film.The basic storyline is the same for both the book and the film, although both are very different. However, both are just as enchanting as each other. The ending are very different, so do not get confused between the two. I prefer the film ending, but if the book had ended like that, then there couldn't be any more books in the series (and I haven't included the ending so that I don't spoil the movie for anyone).The acting in the movie was amazing I think, and was definitely the right choice for everyone. There is so much emotion in the film and moods to convey, so it would be a difficult job for anyone to play the children, mother or the harsh grandmother, but everyone portrayed their part fantastically.This is definitely a must-see film for anybody.

The movie tries to make the plot into something as non-controversial as possible (and ends up missing a lot of the main points of the novel).

While the plot of her dying at her wedding isn't all that bad, it is completely different to the book which they are claiming this to be a film adaption of.The other thing is the actors. Now, it is my opinion that Virginia Andrews describes people more beautiful than possible, but they picked a mediocre bunch of people to portray them.Since I saw the movie first, then read the book, I expected I may dislike the book, but I have to tell you, if you are considering watching the movie - you'd be more entertained to read the book.

In general every time I read a book and then watch the film to it, there are some things missing, like some of the major scenes people want to see. When I read flowers in the attic I was captured by the story and by the characters. I envisioned them to be almost doll like and beautiful and especially the mother.Usually when a woman is very beautiful she passes on her beautiful traits to her children. The movie was nothing compared to the book. Maybe a few scenes here and there to tell you that you are watching the movie version of flowers in the attic, but nothing major. It did not keep me on the edge of my seat at all. I loved the book so much that I wanted my younger brother and sister to see it, so I went out and searched for the movie at blockbuster and after they watched it they were not impressed at all. I also read a book called Garden of Shadows which leads up to the story of flowers in the attic. I would really love it if some really great director came out with the movie version of Garden of Shadows and as the follow up with a remake of Flowers in the Attic. And if the movie is recreated I would really like to see that the characters look as if they are described in the book and also they should at least be real blonde's and try not to leave out the most explosive scenes. People love drama and to leave out the most dramatic parts of the book makes no sense. I will continue to write about this until someone remakes the movie Flowers in the Attic.

The plot revolves around a seemingly perfect family, two parents, four children (all of them unrealistically beautiful)and their happy life - until the father dies.  Instantly, they are destitute and all of their furniture is respossessed.  Why is it that every B movie follows the theme of instant poverty when someone dies?  Apparantly, concepts like having life insurance, owning furniture, etc, don't apply in filmland.  Whenever tragedy strikes in a film, we discover that every house is double-mortgaged to the hilt.  Maybe this is a subtle comment on American consumerism.  Mother's only recourse after this turn of events is to take her children back to her relatives she has alienated by marrying her own uncle.  She actually encourages her children to sleep in the same bed, as if normalizing her own act of incest by perpetuating it in her children who don't know any better.  Naturally, the relatives are evil and twisted, and lock the children in the attic, and we discover that mother is definitely from the same family stock.  There are too many reviews that give a blow by blow description of the plot for me to repeat them, but my main observation is that this is a typical copout provocative movie, with a sicker-than-usual theme;  it alludes to incest, without actually confronting it, which causes the story to fall between the cracks in a bad way. It becomes irrelevant to the story, and there isn't much of a story here to begin with. Either the incest theme should have been eliminated entirely, or dealt with frankly.  Instead, we are shown scenes of brother washing his sister's back in the tub, undressing in front of each other, etc.  Sex is never shown, though it is left up to our imaginations whether they are actually in a sexual relationship or just never taught that brothers and sisters don't undress in front of each other.  The only thing that works is the way the characters don't know that what they are doing is wrong, in fact are innocent to the implications.  The movie tries to have its cake and eat it too, i.e. imply incest and then chicken out, but gives us insulting implied scenes as if we are being nudged in the ribs by a pervert in the local porn shop, only not as subtle.  Implying incest without confronting it in an honest way makes us feel as if we are being manipulated into having perverted fantasies about these characters ourselves, which is the most disgusting aspect of this film, and is my biggest problem with it.  An intelligent script could have dealt with incest in a psychological way, as we understand these characters' relations with each other, and eliminated all the sudsy bath sequences (which true pervs will be dissappointed in, as they don't actually show anything) that makes us feel like we are peeking in someone's bathroom window.An intelligent script would also deal with the idea of family betrayal (by the mother) in an intelligent way; but this isn't an intelligent script.  It relies entirely on atmosphere and images of betrayal, which don't work or are extremely heavy-handed.  This is a very depressing movie about depressing ideas, depressingly presented.  Only the final line Eat the cookie, mother!  gives it a surreal hilarity for a moment. The saddest part of this movie is that the actors are all very good; but they are completely wasted, because the script and direction isn't there to support them.  Four out of ten stars.

Andrews. Following my first read, I read it another 3½ times along with the three follow-up books and one prequel book. I loved every minute of that series and remember the events and journey of Cathy, Chris, Cory and Carrie to this day.When the movie first came out in 1987, my sister &#x96; another huge influence on my childhood &#x96; just had to take me to the movie. Not that I was complaining; 1987 was just when I grew and fell in love with movies (my passion for cinema would only grow tenfold from there.)Since we were both familiar with the story of the flowers in the attic, we walked away disappointed and felt betrayed. So much had changed from novel to screen. Especially&#x85;.that ending. That horrible, terrible, misplaced, no good and actually laughable climax.I believe I saw the movie just shy of a handful of times later on home video, but not for twenty years would I watch it again. 2014 announced to me a Lifetime (TV) film version of this and it sparked my interest into seeing this again after two decades away from Foxworth Hall and the Four Cs.Okay, the movie was very 80s, and had some way overacting &#x96; namely by Kristy Swanson and that ending &#x96; Oh, dear God, that misleading, incorrect and unintentionally hilarious finale &#x96; was just as awful. But, I must say the movie still held true (for the most part) to the original idea behind the V.C. Andrews story.Yes, they changed details, events and made it, incredibly, less violent, claustrophobic and shorter than the events in the book, but the key plot points and motivations were present. And Director/Writer Jeffrey Bloom did all he could to bring a phenomenal book to about 90 minutes of footage. Still not sure how he came up with the last few minutes, though I suspect studio interference for that blunder.The story revolves around four young siblings who get locked up in a room/attic while their recently widowed mother fights for the love of her dying rich father from which she previously fell from grace. Mother's visits to her eventually neglected children become scarce as the weeks and months go by, but they have more to worry about as their hyper-religious and angry Grandmother's punishments increase.With that synopsis, I only touched on the tip of the iceberg with this tale of suspense, love, hope, horror, danger, yearning, greed, despair and future. As did this movie. Watching this should be like reading the back description of the book on the back cover. Then you should read the whole thing, and don't stop until you read all five books in the series. It's truly a great read and never lets the reader down.I digress. This movie, for any of its shortcomings, will always have a special place in my heart. From what it meant growing up, and being with my sister. No matter what they changed, I can still get that feeling, albeit summary, of the book I read nearly five times.* * * Final thoughts The first line, up to the &#x85; of my review is the first line of the book, though eighties replaced fifties for accuracy in my story. To this day, from all the countless books I read, this first book I ever read's first line will stay with me to my end days. I loved it as I did the rest of the book. I don't know why I remember it so well or fondly, but I always will. Think what you will of this movie, but if you had my experience with these&#x85; Flowers in the Attic&#x85;you might actually love this movie more than what it deserves.

They did a good job capturing the creepy, depressive spirit in the novel. At least, the mother and the kids look like they literally jumped out of the book and onto the screen. Their acting was terrible because the movie had a bad director. And poor Louise Fletcher was either miscast or so poorly directed that she almost ruined the film.

I thought Ben Ganger and Lindsay Parker were perfect as the twins, Cory and Carrie, though Kristy Swanson and Jeb Adams weren't nearly as impressive as Cathy and Christopher.  The actress that played the mother, Corrine, lacked the physical and emotional characteristics the book possessed her with, but the actress that played the grandmother did a pretty good job at being evil and torturous.  The movie does have its moments when you feel sorry for the children, but it also has its moments when you wanna shake them and scream Just drop kick the psycho grandma and get out of there you idiots!

What was written in the book was completely different from what went on in the film. The acting was rubbish and i didn't believe what the actors were saying. The reason a lot of the scenes in the book were cut from the film, was because if the incest scenes were left in, a lot of the target audience wouldn't have been allowed to go and see it because of the censorship. I think whoever cast the actors were either new at their job or were very bad at it - none of the actors were believable enough for me (and most other people it seems). The main reason the film was made was for Victoria Andrews who unfortunately died before it was released in the cinema. I feel sorry for her and her family when this was released because it put her writing to shame.There should be a remake and the other books in the series for a tribute to the 16th anniversary of her death.

One of the novel's major themes is incest. The Dollenganger family are the product of a vaguely incestuous union (Mother married her father's much younger half-brother), and during their imprisonment in the attic, the older brother and sister actually have sex once, but in the book this all has its own peculiar logic and actually makes sense.Director Jeffrey Bloom and the production team backed off of the incest; the mother's marriage is mentioned once and the two older siblings have a closeness that is vaguely suggestive but otherwise the theme of incest is never really developed.At the beginning of the film we meet the Dollanganger family Mom Corinne (Victoria Tennant), father Christopher (Marshall Colt), and their four children Christopher (Jeb Stuart Adams), Catherine (Kristy Swanson), and the twins Cory (Ben Ryan Ganger) and Carrie (Lindsay Parker). They are a close family; almost too close, but their world is shattered when the father is killed in an automobile accident.Mother, grief-stricken, is unable to cope with life, and eventually they find themselves penniless and on the street, so Mother decides to take the children to the home of her parents, grandparents the children have never seen. On the way there, Mother reveals that her father disinherited her for something she did years ago, and this pilgrimage is a mission to win back his love and reenter his good graces.We finally arrive at the Foxworth Mansion and are greeted by Grandmother, played by none other than Louise Fletcher. Fletcher is great here, as she always is when she plays a type of evil woman who wields power, but I did find myself thinking the poor woman should have had a word with her agent; ever since the 1976 Oscars Fletcher had been playing variations on the Nurse Ratched theme. But no matter. No one did it better than she.The other actors were savaged by the critics, but I thought they were quite good. Victoria Tennant and Kristy Swanson, who both took a major shellacking in the reviews, deliver in fact the two performances (along with Fletcher's) that drive the narrative forward. In fact, all four of the kids deliver fine work. No, the actors are not the problem; they work hard and are mostly effective. What cobbles them is an extremely awkward script; people simply do not speak the way these kids do most of the time (Cathy has a habit of constantly repeating her older brother's name, for example). And Tennant as their mother comes across as stilted and stiff most of the time, though this may be her way of indicating that Corinne is under the spell of her mother. Only Fletcher seems to have the gift of flinging about the rather purple dialogue; her character is a religious fanatic, half Nurse Ratched and half Margaret White from CARRIE, and she has a field day with her role.In the end, it is Kristy Swanson's Cathy who proves to be her grandmother's (AND mother's) nemesis. Swanson is fierce despite the awkwardness of some of what she has to say, and all four of the kids make a believable family.I am not going to reveal the plot. It's something that should be experienced. Some will probably hate it, but I was most impressed. They ripped half the guts out of what was a truly excellent book in the Gothic tradition, yet still managed to produce something eerie and frightening. In spite of what the film lacks, they managed to give it a somber and creepy mood that is not only impressive but hard to forget.But if you see the film, do read the novel as well; it's great.

Only Louise Fletcher as the cruel grandmother, delivers any real or decent performance. Now I've always liked Kristy Swanson during her teen years, in the many TV movies and smaller roles she's played, and Jeb Stuart pulled off some decent supporting roles himself, in some classic 80's teen movies. However, direction did not pull much justice of intensity for either one of their characters in this. At times their Chris and Cathy's are plain flat or just whiny. And their 'interaction' with the mother, also falls flat.And Victoria Tennant. Get me started on her. The former Mrs. Steve Martin (Yes, the famous comic actor who seasoned during SNL) is as bad or flat an actress is bad-acting can nose-dive. She always was noted as mediocre. And here, she is less than such. Barely believable as Corrine, in spite any proper direction she was allotted during shoot.

My interest lie however in actress Kristy Swanson, and I think she's just the most wonderful little thing in this movie)Addendum, 26 April 2015. ***SPOILER ALERT*** Unfortunately the second half of the movie is a total shambles. At the end, the whole movie is discredited with that weakly staged fall from the balcony. Gee, she practically walks over to the balcony and offers to be thrown over. No. Also, they wear those hideous deathly pallor makeup but remain moving fluently, they don't act sick and weak. And if Mother needed to get rid of them, why toy with them? Why the drawn- out fuss? Weakest link is Grandmother, who has a menacing presence in the first half, but shows petty jealousy and quenches her envy by cutting off most of Cathy's long hair. The hatred the old has for the young... Rest of the second half, Grandmother is oddly ineffectual, and Kristy is not entirely convincing in her vengeful mode. Nice try, but needed more practice. A promising set-up that was off to a good start but got a whole lot off track. I am not going to blast it, though. But the prose I wrote last week, was directed at the first half. I do understand that the story had to turn nasty, but the points I make are totally valid, and the script turned into a sinking ship. Gee, the haters are high-fiving themselves, this 'fan' is all of a sudden quite deluded, looking on his nose, the Home Team lost in the second half. No, haters! The movie is so promising in the first half that I would be focusing on that.By the way, towards the end of these compiled reviews, you'll find one by 'blackfirestars'. I have a bone to pick with this 'author' and the many unwarranted comments. I will not even allude to them here, except for one Suggesting that Cathy was masturbating in the bath. Wishful thinking on your part? Look, I myself admit to being naughtily inclined, but I would refrain from insinuating anything that cannot be proved. Cathy was daydreaming in the bath, as she was lifting her leg out of the water she is clearly thinking about being a ballerina. The title of 'blackfirestars' review is beneath contempt, I dearly wish to address it here, but it seems I might only give credibility to that dark comment if I protest it. An interesting viewing experience. Must say that the experience here at IMDb marred it more than just a bit. Would be interesting to see the remake. One day...

I don't want to mention all the things that were butchered to make this ragged movie. Too many details missing. Was the movie that tight on budget that they couldn't afford to make the scenes flow more realistically? Like teaching the twins in the attic on those old desks in the attic and teaching them crafts with all the gifts Corrine would bring. Not once did I see her bring any gifts, they mentioned them, they mentioned many things but why weren't they portrayed in the movie? What happened to the Attic? It did not fit the description of the book in the least. Let me stress the title of the this story is Flowers in the Attic and that is where the young Dollangangers spent most of their days, where Cathy grew into puberty. They should of focused more about that. Not implement so many things in the movie that didn't exist in the book. I missed the twins sitting on the small desks and the blackboard, I miss Cathy impersonating the grandmother or dancing? All I saw was Cathy doing stretching exercises. I did not see her putting on old records and dancing, dancing, dancing. Oh and what about Cathy's hair that got cut off?

If you've seen the movie and haven't read the book, read the book and you'll see why I'm going mad! In the book I cry in nearly every chapter and in the movie I didn't cry at all except for the fact I cried because it was so bad. Anyway I recommend the book not the movie!!

She plays the psychotic grandmother of some children who move into her house with their mother after their father's death. But as time goes by, it starts looking as if the mom might not be much better.Fletcher makes her role chilling, but the presence of Victoria Tennant makes it hard to take this seriously as a thriller. You see, Tennant was married to Steve Martin for some years and co-starred with him in All of Me and LA Story. Even as her character grew more and more hostile, I kept expecting Steve Martin to enter the scene as the wild and crazy guy. The other main cast member is Kristy Swanson, whose best known movie role is the title character in the completely brainless Buffy the Vampire Slayer.And then there's the comparison to the book. Prior to watching the movie I had never even heard of V.C. Andrews, let alone known that she'd written a series of books about unpleasant families. I did read that they changed a number of things from the book. In the end, this mostly ends up looking like one of those movies only memorable for the bizarre cast that they assembled (others include Hurry Sundown and The Greatest Story Ever Told).

"},{"Title":"Okay as a movie.","Date":"23 May 2012","Score":"","Genre":"Drama, Mystery, Thriller","Review":" To begin with, this viewer has to admit that he hasn't ever read the phenomenally successful novel on which this movie is based, and therefore can't judge it as an adaptation, although fans of the book make it quite clear that this utterly fails in that regard. I was aware that this movie, rated PG-13, waters down some of the elements of the novel such as incest and sadism. Taken on its own, I also have to admit I found this movie reasonably grim and compelling. The basic story is a good one a family is thrown into turmoil upon the death of the father, whereupon the mother must desperately turn to her own mother for food and shelter. Unfortunately, the four children eventually realize that they're trapped in the grandparents' opulent mansion, specifically the attic. Ugly truths and true natures come to the surface as the mother seems to stop caring about her kids at all. The movie does indeed get a lot out of the casting in the central roles. Louise Fletcher in particular is excellent in the kind of ice cold villainess part that became her stock in trade. I don't know about any other viewers out there, but *I* certainly wouldn't want Nurse Ratched for a grandmother. Victoria Tennant is good as the mother with a secret to hide; she initially earns some sympathy but loses it before too long. Kristy Swanson, Jeb Stuart Adams, Ben Ryan Ganger, and Lindsay Parker are all likable enough as the troubled kids. Once Flowers in the Attic approaches its finale, one can feel their blood turn cold when they see just how evil and selfish the people in this story can be. The material does hit a nerve. At the least, this has served to make me want to read the novel after which I too may very well seethe about what could / should have been. For now I see it as a halfway decent melodrama / thriller, that does benefit from beautiful music by Christopher Young and a sober enough tone. Author V.C. Andrews does a cameo as a window washer. Six out of 10.

A serious effort and nice location. The music was good. But quite frankly I found the storyline to be flimsy, utterly illogical, unbelievable, and downright boring. It is a matter of taste I suppose since I see most rated it much higher than I did, so maybe you might enjoy it if you are loose on logic and view it while eating pizza or something. However if you are a serious cinemaphile I suggest you read some of the reviews that I wish I had read before deciding to spend 90 minutes on it.

First, is that it was written to be an x rated film, or an r....It was shot as an r rating. Then the producers fumbled around and cut the best footage out to release this to a general audience, leaving everybody confused. The writer was so upset, she wrote a scathing letter to producer Sy Levin. The second problem is that Sy Levin was involved. Sy no longer can show his face in Hollywood. He was a friend of O.J. Simpson's and was cut of the same cloth as O.J., his friends were involved in the distribution of hard drugs, and had bragged to me about how much fun it was to stab somebody... Sy was interested in producing the O.J. Simpson court documentary that would prove he was innocent. Meanwhile, I was threatened by them, and had to call the police hot line to save my life. Sy's friends got 25 to life for their other crimes, Sy always gets off without charges, but can no longer show his face in Hollywood. It's a shame that the best footage of some fine actors went on the cutting room floor. Gus Peters gave an excellent performance. This film should be re-edited as an x, although the footage is probably lost forever. I would look forward to the sequel, perhaps Fries can do it properly now that Sy Levin is no longer associated with anybody, and can no longer destroy anybody's life. "},{"Title":"Awful.

At the beginning you have four children joyfully hiding behind a sofa to surprise their father when he comes home from work. The two oldest kids look to be in their twenties. The sight of them trying to hide behind the sofa looked ridiculous. None of the four children could act, they were very very bad. The mother couldn't act either. By the size of the two oldest kids they could easily have overpowered the grandmother and escape, but no, they didn't even try. The grandmother gives them a list of rules they have to obey whilst they live in her house but the rules are never revealed to the audience, so why even mention them? When the kids start to get sickly from their incarceration, powder is obviously rubbed into their faces, hilarious. My opinion is whoever made this movie stole the name of a novel and then proceeded to ignore said novel whilst making this dross. The incest in the book is not mentioned nor even hinted at and the ending is ridiculous. Avoid this so called movie at all costs.

Her rigid, expressionless face never betrays a hint of happiness, let alone a smile. She imposes strict rules on the grandchildren who are forced to live in tight confinement in the otherwise large, rambling house that becomes their prison.In this endeavour she is aided and abetted by her daughter who is less convincing in her role as the penniless widow who returns home to mend fences with her parents and achieve her long-lost inheritance. As the movie progresses, we see little of the dysfunctional relationship that compels her to be as mean as her own mother must have been with her, with the exception of the lashes her mother administers for the 17 years of absence.The world of the children eventually forces them into action to try to extricate themselves from the evil that is throttling and endangering their lives. Things reach a climax with a family tragedy. Of the children, the elder daughter is the most convincing. I haven't read the book, which is usually just as well since films can seldom weave in the detail that a good book can achieve. On that basis, this is not a bad movie.

The movie comes across like flat soda pop. The photography is murky-looking, and there are no visuals that catch the eye. The acting is utterly unconvincing, except maybe for the butler character, because he never says a word at any point in the movie. The story moves at an extremely slow pace, with no tension at any point, not even when the (subdued) music score blares. Also, the story at several points seems to be missing footage that was discarded during the editing process, leading to some confusion on some details.

Also, both the book and the movie are very disturbing, so they got that right.However, after that, there are many discrepancies. First off, almost every main character except for the grandmother is miscast. The actress who played the grandmother could have been the inspiration for the character in the novel; she was excellent. However, the mother, Corrine, Cathy, and Chris could have all been played by different actors to make the movie more plausible. The actress who played the mother was neither attractive nor charismatic-2 things necessary to understand the feelings her children have towards her. Kristy Swanson did okay, but to put it kindly, she makes a much better Buffy the Vampire Slayer than a character from a V.C. Andrews novel. The actor who plays Chris matches the physical description of the novel character, but is too stiff and humorless. I think better casted actors would have improved this movie, but then again, I only saw this movie cause I liked Buffy the Vampire Slayer-with Kristy Swanson. And then, a lot is missing from the novel. Not just certain events or dialouge, but some of the major themes. Some of the most haunting concepts about this book (and the whole series) is Chris's obsessive love for Cathy, the grandmother's bitter jealousy of her daughter and her young grand daughter, and Cathy's obsession with measuring up to her mother is all unmentioned in this movie. We don't understand why the Grandmother hates the mother and children so much. We learn later that the mother and her half brother(the children's father, who's mother was raped by the grandmother's husband, which consequently produced Corrine) fell in love when they were young (and both living with Corrine's parents) and abandoned the grandmother. She saw the 2 of them falling in love as a betrayal to her, as did Corrine's father(who was secretly in love with his daughter) and swore she would never love them or their offspring again. She refuses to love her grandchildren cause she doesn't want to be hurt by them.I was especially disappointed with the way they left out Chris's unbrotherly love for Cathy and the rape. Yes, it's kind of icky. But it's what makes V.C. Andrews' novels stand out. Chris doesn't declare his love for Cathy or rape her until the end of the novel, but you can see it building up to that throughout the novel-one thing that I think captivates the readers.

Perhaps the now much older Kristy Swanson could play her, although Victoria Tennant was great. Grandmother is a tough call, since Louise Fletcher was Brilliant!!! I would only hope she is still acting and could reprise the role. If not, perhaps they could get Tyne Daly, an expert at playing mean mothers.

John (the butler) didn't even know about them. The grandmother doesn't strike me as the type who'd wear makeup, and the things added in made it worse. They totally gave away the arsenic poisoning (which was on doughnuts to let you know, not cookies), Cathy did not wear a bra (she was not that well developed in the beginning of the story) and the mouse's name was MICKEY!!!!! That bothered me a lot. But mostly Chris's and Cathy's relationship omittance annoyed - that doesn't even begin to describe it - me. In general, the movie sucked. But the book was excellent. The writer of the screenplay obviously didn't know what the hell he was doing, nor could he get into Cathy's mind. She was psychic, for God's sake! And there was never a hint of that! It's a sacrilege of the book. I recommend the book to everyone - it has a moral point to it - and is beautiful. I cried from a sick pain while watching the movie and cried from emotional sadness during the book.

I have, however, also read less than flattering reviews of this film and now I can see why. It reduced the storyline a little too much - the drama is never really at any sort of peak. You feel as though they filmed a longer version but cut out the most dramatic turning points to fit the estimated running time. Strange choice too, to feature the wedding considering that - at the point in the novel where Chris revealed the fate of his grandfather - all they really wanted to do was get away. The last thing the siblings wanted in the book (and, I thought, in the film - up to this moment) was to be around their mother.Chris is oddly cast - he talks like a teenager but he looks about 27, I presume they substituted him calling her Momma for Mom because the first name sounds too old-fashioned, given the date when the film was released but it doesn't give the film any sense of time. Cathy looks very 80s in the second hour - she could almost look like the girl in the Take On Me video by a-Ha with her hair cut (at least in the earlier part of the film, her hair is a convincing 1950s type of style) but she has got that self-preservation ethos and manner of asking the very questions that a teenager would ask and which a mother like hers wouldn't want to have to answer, so the personality is captured quite well. She seems a bit whiny at times, but then, so was the Cathy in the book. The grandmother's dresses are very like they are described in the book and they have got some continuity with Carrie's hair getting longer and longer.The twins aren't badly cast, but the mother seems moronic (I know she was in the book, but she is always talking in this breathy excited whisper, although her tantrums when the kids get fed up with her show at least one other emotion and she is a very spoilt brat - very like in the book, in fact). The wardrobe department must have had a massive stock of white material that they had to use up, though. In the book Cathy is always describing her mother as wearing richly coloured clothes yet in the evening ball or dance (or whatever it was) scene, all the extras are in white - it seems odd.The dramatic bits seemed too obvious - darkness, people hiding behind doors, thumping piano music that somebody obviously equated with scary. The nearly-escape scene contains every cliché going - guard dogs barking, man with a gun on patrol (he was slow to react, given that the dogs had been barking for about five minutes), rope breaking. It's almost Sylvester and Tweety Pie.The vocal, semi-Gregorian chanting gets annoying - I think it's supposed to be creepy. The shot of Cory's grave being filled in looked convincing enough to start with but the idea of a further three graves being dug out and waiting to be filled seems contrived and frankly stupid - if you're going to kill somebody (especially if you're trying to keep it a secret) I don't think most intelligent killers would have ready-made graves on standby to be filled in as the body count rose. We are then supposed to believe that Corrine's new husband had no idea that she had children with her first husband! (In the book this is true.) Had he gone for a walk around the estate shown in this film, he couldn't have failed to note three gaping holes in the earth! Overall, I suppose the film makers made an attempt at telling the story, but they didn't seem to have a clear vision of its purpose. Too dramatic and eerie in parts for little children yet the more adult themes from the novel (obviously, the incestuous relationship between Chris and Cathy, and the violent beatings and/or whippings inflicted on Corrine Foxworth and her children - which are, to my mind, memorable events from the original novel) are ignored so completely that it is becomes just another dysfunctional family film.The real problem, though, is that you can't effectively dramatise Flowers In The Attic in the two-hour time frame of the average film. You need a miniseries for that - perhaps the film makers recognised this here and that was why they cut out so much of the content?

Badly acted, badly set out, terrible soundtrack and with most of the decent plot removed in a cowardly way.I read the books when I was a teenager, and fell in love with the whole series - Flowers in the Attic being my favourite. So when I found out there was a film, I was so excited. It was entirely wasted though because this film is just SO terrible.The only redeeming feature, I thought, was Jeb Stuart Adams who did his best and played the part of Chris as well as he could, sometimes even well enough to keep you in the story. Similarly, the parts of Cory and Carrie were reasonably well played - but sadly, any and all decent acting in this 'film' were ruined by Kristy Swanson who completely obliterated the main part of Cathy. So many other people, no-name actresses, could have played this role with astounding ability - but instead I was left violently despising her.Also, I am sure I am not the only one who was highly annoyed at the fact that the film was utterly void of the entire Chris/Cathy relationship. I'm sure it was done on purpose due to cowardice on the directors part, and can understand why they would want to remove the whole bother/sister relationship aspect from it....but it was this decision that removed the film from all recognition of its former book self. So now instead of the tense, complex relationship between Chris and Cathy, we have an annoying sister who whines all over the good looking Jeb Stuart Adams as we sit there and cross our arms in revulsion.Cathy in the books was fiery, helplessly manipulative and loving to the family. Sure at times you get annoyed at her, but you absolutely sympathised with her. She was you as you read the book, and you fell in love with Chris along with her. In this film I kept hoping that another dramatic plot alteration would involve Cathy dying early. No such luck, but if you were disappointed by that - don't worry - the ending is so far removed from the original you would ever recognise it.To conclude, if you want a lukewarm film, with tepid acting, an annoying female lead, a lot of choral whining in the background and large chunks of good plot missing - this is your movie. I won't say bypass it completely because of how much I love Chris and was pleased with Jeb, but don't have fantastic expectations - you'll be as sad as I was.I give it 4/10 - the 4 is for Jeb and the twins.

Flowers in the attic is the adaptive movie based on the V.C. Andrews bestseller (and to this day is a very controversial and deeply haunting, moving book); the story is about the Dollanganger family and their kids Christopher, Cathy (or Kathy), Carrie, and Cory four kids who had to suffer the loss of their father in a car accident and had to deal with a quick realization of a grandmother they didn't know about who was very wealthy and might be able to help them and their mother only to come with a lot of shocking truths and had to depend on each other in their darkest moments of their lives that would change them.Right off the bat, you'll noticed that not everything was kept in the movie which they should have done right up to Christopher and Cathy (or Kathy) somewhat romantic kindling; you can tell that bits and pieces of the book fell into the cracks of the film but only few and the rest never showed up, on top of that it was added by bad acting on the parts of the actors...I'm sure its not their fault that would go to the bad script writing that was fused into this movie...being that Wes craven was suppose to direct this movie I'm sure it would of been a great adaptation but since it wasn't him and was directed by Jeffery bloom he somewhat hacked this movie and again it fell short of what a good movie could of been if stuck to the novel. I've seen this many times before a book that is really good and very eerie at the same time becomes a victim of becoming a movie and suddenly had to deal with rushed time, rushed scenes, and no direction to make this movie as deep and squeamish as the book ever was and still is and I still read the book more than the movie.I can say the only saving grace of this movie was the sense of foreboding in the characters which was a good thing being they were stuck in a part of the house that not many people would dare to go too and they had to deal with this and the torture of what's to come; Also the locations were really good and also put the feel of being where they were and trying to enjoy the aspects of their surroundings that was going to be their home. And finally I have to give it to the composer Christopher Young he put the feel of sadness and emotion into the movie and if there ever was a remake of this film I would say bring him back with the original theme to this movie because it was really beautiful and also haunting. But for most part this movie could have been a really good product but came short in a lot of areas no thanks to the director and screenplay writing...more should of been added and it should of been left up to the people watching how much they could take of the abuse that was giving to the kids but that was never done and the results was a low grade movie based off a book that could have been!

Not only was he subjected to a severe test of his patience as a film-goer, but had to lose money in the process. Ironically, this is the same year that Evil Dead 2 came out starring Bruce Campbell, a movie that was most likely playing at the very same theatre (which would have been a far better choice even on the whim of a guess over FITA). What a bad stroke of luck this guy had.This film is not only bad, but it is not even laughably bad. Laughably bad are the following films The Core, The Hills Have Eyes (the original), Troma's War, Class of Nuke Em' High, Class of 1999, Bad Taste (although entertaining for its gross-out quotient). These films have merit for the sake of knowing they are bad. They make us laugh because it's self-parody.Flowers in the Attic somehow finds a new low in cinema (or found one I should say). I feel disgust for not only myself since I cannot have the 90 minutes of my life I wasted watching this garbage, but for every single person involved in the making of this film except for the director (he is solely responsible for its fruition). As a crew, I'm sure they had to smile a lot around the director during production so as not to look dumbfounded and disgusted. My guess is when the director yelled cut!, the crew let out a not-so-obvious sigh of relief. Even more so when he announced, that's a wrap! The acting is very bad, the photography is uninteresting, the locations are mundane, the role of the Grandmother played by Louis Fletcher is not convincing whatsoever, and the list goes on and on. The main thing to attack really is the script itself, which from what I hear from fans of the novel it was adapted from is one of the most tragically altered renditions that they know of. What else could top these things on the list of bad other than the fact that two lead actors have us not at all concerned of their plight or unease. They are not physically tortured in the film (which brings me to ask, why is this movie PG-13?), but in one scene when the grandmother knocks over the daughters beloved (and highly fragile) music box, the daughter screams in agony and twitches her face as if she is enduring 15 lashes across her front torso.You might be curious to see this film just to see how bad it really is, but that would be a mistake. You will almost find yourself feeling unclean and your stomach will assuredly churn. Worst of all, much like the poor guy that remembers his experience in the theatre some 19 years ago, you will unfortunately remember this film for a long time as the most horrific of traumatic film experience ever to take place and be recorded in one's memory bank. The young ons in South Park have inspired me to take a road trip across wherever to track the director down and ask not for monetary compensation, but simply for 90 minutes of my life back.

This movie makes no mention of them having sex, kissing, or even looking at eachother funny! The acting is pretty bad, especially the two smallest children, even more so the little boy. Kristy Swanson goes from poor to mediocre and never truly shines in the lead. Also disappointing is Victoria Tenant as the mother,who I feel really didnt emote as much as she could. In early scenes of grief she just sort of snivels and looks pathetic, where a normal person would've been in near hysteria in this sort of situation. The one person I think did a capable job was Louise Fleischer(sp?) as the Grandma, she was evil and scarey and had a fierce presence.

Further, the results of a young, impressionable brother and sister being forced to live in such circumstances during their formative years led, in the book, to a situation that would have been very hard to get past the censors at that time and had to be left out.  Then, matters were made worse by the absolutely stupid ending (although the way the filmakers chose to end the movie eliminates any possibility at an equally painful to watch sequel!).

The only scene that really grabbed me was when Carrie screams in her grandmothers face and the grandmother picks her up by her hair, and slaps the little boy who tries to help his sister. The movie is worth watching for this scene alone. But overall i would'nt recommend this movie.

The film differs so much from the book its quite unbelievable. Why they would waste time filming scenes which had absolutely no consequence at all to the plot and missing out important features such as the relationship between Cathy and Chris is pathetic! It is clear that whoever made this rubbish never went anywhere near the book let alone read it and should be ashamed. The ending... what on earth happened there? Corrine doesn't die until 'If there be Thornes' which is the third book in the series and even then she is allowed to redeem herself a little by saving Cathy. Also, in the book Cathy and Chris are meant to only be 12 and 14 but in the film they both look at least 25. I don't know about anyone else but I wasn't amazed by the beauty of these children at all, they were supposed to be striking! The acting was terrible and extremely overdone, this film is nothing but a complete mockery of an amazing piece of literature. Another thing, why on earth did Jonn Amos no about the children? Why was the mouse called Fred not Mickey? Why only 17 lashes on Corrines back, it was 33 wasn't it? Why cookies, not donuts? Why was Cory buried in the woods and not his remains not concealed within the house?

Perhaps because of how much I enjoyed the book, I absolutely hated the movie.  Yes, I mean hated.  Abhorred. Despised.First off, the acting was...oooh how do I put this?  CRAP!  And that's putting it mildly.  Victoria Tennant (Mother) was just purely awful.  Not a single line portrayed any realism whatsoever.  Louise Fletcher (as Grandmother) is normally quite menacing in her roles, but this time, she was absolutely laughable.  Perhaps she simply didn't have much to work with. Kristy Swanson (Kathy)...how on EARTH did they choose her?  Every single line was over the top, overly dramatic, and just so plain ridiculously delivered it made me wonder if I was watching an Ed Wood film.  Umm, yeah, it was that bad.  Jeb Stuart Adams (Chris) was, well, ok I suppose.  He wasn't *as* bad as the others, but still had his moments of Can someone please buy me some acting lessons?    Thankfully, the children playing the twins had few lines as they were already difficult to deal with WITHOUT words.The screenplay was just downright awful.  Now I understand that books cannot always be *perfectly* translated into a movie, but c'mon...FAR TOO MANY changes took place that completely took away from the story itself. Well, at least for those of us that read the book.  The dialogue was excrement, to state it lightly.About the only thing this movie had going for it was the setting.  The huge mansion and grounds would have been fantastic for the movie had not the rest of it been so darn awful.  It's a shame, this really could have been a great one.  Unfortunately, it was nothing but a major dud that left little to enjoy.Flowers in the Attic (the movie) earns 2 out of 10 stars (and that's for the ability to pick a great setting).The book, however, earns 10 out of 10 stars and I HIGHLY recommend it to anyone who loves reading.

They missed out the most important parts of the book, killed off the mother before her time, and ignored the fact that the children spent their formative years in an attic...they would have physically changed in that time, yet in the world of the film it was as though only seconds had passed...I just ask that if there is a remake ever made, please please please don't make the mistakes that were made with this one.

Which is why the evil grandmother played by the usually talented Louise Fletcher (what was she thinking when she took this role.

The set decoration and designs are just plain awful, did they have to use floodlights in every scene? That has got to be the brightest attic I've ever seen. By the way when was the story set?

Finally, back to the story line, the final confrontation with the mother was not the least bit believable. No self-respecting daytime soap opera would allow such a contrived and awkward confrontation to occur. I've never read the V.C. Andrews novels, and from other people's comments in Amazon.com, thank god! They were favorable comments but the novels seem to be filled with deceit, betrayal, revenge, and incest. Is everybody sure that V.C. Andrews wasn't a pseudonym used by Jackie Collins? Maybe some executive from Lifetime or Oxygen would turn the whole book series into a Maxi-miniseries. If they do please do not blame me for imparting that lack of wisdom to them.

I know that at my junior high, the reading teachers all got together and banned book reports on any title in the series.  That's how sick and tired they were of hearing about them.  So, as a freshman in college, you can imagine how excited I was to see the film of Flowers in the Attic come to the multiplex. I knew I was in trouble two minutes into the film and it went downhill from there.  I wished that I had an evil grandmother to abuse me and lock me in an attic.  That way I wouldn't have to watch this movie, which I consider to be the most utterly worthless film of all time.  Previous comments on this website have expressed relief that a sequel was never made.  About half-way through the movie, something happens that makes it impossible the for the rest of the series to continue anyway.  They took the one thing upon which the rest of the books hinged and did away with it.  This movie is so terrible, that about ten minutes before it ended, I started to weep.  I know that the few other people in the theatre, for this was a well-deserved flop, were wondering who that stupid guy was, crying in the second row, but I couldn't help it.  I don't know if what I'm about to say is going to be accepted for publication here but I really wish I could have a bowel movement on a print of this movie.  Why doesn't the IMDB offer the 0 stars option?

How anyone could consider this picture *above average* or even a neutral viewing experience simply astounds me. I, myself, watched it in its televised entirety, while compelled by what I can now only describe as a state of masochistic curiosity - a need to know how low the craft of cinema can go, and how much I could endure.I can imagine some of you envisioning this movie as a sort of recreational bad movie that has a sort of hokey fun sense about it. Allow me to emphatically refute that notion this movie is a negative viewing experience under any conditions and should only be watched by hard-core punishment gluttons. Not only does it feature atrocious acting, pacing, and dialog, but it --for no discernable reason other than the discomfort of the viewer -- (Dare I call them Spoilers?) gradually introduces incest into the story, first cruelly hinting at it, then finally confirming it. When you aren't being repulsed by the creepy-but-not-in-a-way-ness, the sheer tedium of the movie drives the you to attempt to engage the story. You wonder What Would I do in this situation? forgetting that the situation is a psychotic grandmother imprisoning two able-bodied teenagers, and you would, of course, beat the bejeezus out of the granny, and leave the house and get on with your life. This would've happened, like, day one, thus conveniently eliminating the need for the rest of the movie.I can honestly say that this movie is in serious contention for -- and this is coming from a MST3K fan who has full knowledge that the following phrase is too often tossed around lightly -- The Worst Movie I've Ever Seen. If you have any clue as to why this movie is liked by anyone, anywhere, I'd be interested in hearing from you.

It was more of the early 1960s type dark depressing tripe. The childrens make up was amauterish (Quite obviously white powder on faces in their illness scenes)and with a very dour music score and even more dour commentry throughout the film,it amazes me how it ever got to DVD.

I had heard about the books, but never read them. The movie is absolutely hilarious! I laughed all the way through it. I particularly liked how the actress playing the mother looked like she was about 4 years older than her kids. Also a very funny touch was how the kids sometimes had white makeup on their faces to make them look sickly from one camera angle and not in another one. By the end of the movie tears were rolling down my face I was laughing so hard. Then they told me it wasn't supposed to be a comedy.... Ooops... "},{"Title":"a mess","Date":"4 August 1999","Score":"0 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama, Mystery, Thriller","Review":"  I have not actually read the book for Flowers in the Attic, but seeing the movie was certainly...an experience. The book certainly has a great deal of acclaim, but after a viewing of its film adaption, one must either assume it is either a poor telling, or else wonder just what makes the book so loved?Flowers in the Attic is, I assume, intended to be a thriller/dramatic mix, but mainly comes off as a horror film, and not too good of one. The story centers upon four siblings, two teenagers(Chris and Cathy) and a two young twins(Carrie and Corey), who, along with their mother, are forced to live at their wealthy grandparents after their father passes away. Unfortunately, when they arrive, they are not, to say the least, warmly received by their grandmother. Much to the children's surprise, she tells them a shocking family secret that their father is well... Great Uncle Dad might be an appropriate name. Because their grandmother happens to be very religious (even though it becomes easy to see through her lines that the writer must not know the slightest thing about the Christian religion), she deems the children unfit and decides to keep them hidden from their ailing grandfather, who has never known that they are born. Though her house is as big as a palace, she forbids the children to leave their room, though they are allowed to enter an attic that their room leads to. Their mother is allowed to visit, but as her mother and father grow to accept her(even though she's only the one that married her uncle), the visits become fewer and far between and the children realize that they are now prisoners with no chance of escape...While the storyline may be rife with potential, what results is not. While Chris and Cathy come off as semi-appealing characters, the twins, particularly Carrie(Lindsay Parker), simply do not HAVE much character, and poor little Carrie ends up having almost no point, either. The mother, who goes from caring to disconcerned with her children is interesting at first, but becomes tired, and as for the rest of the characters, well they really make the film go downhill. As the grandmother, Louise Fletcher gives a decent performance for a lousy role. For whatever importance the grandmother held in the book, she's nothing but a cliched, horror movie-esque villian who terrorizes Chris and Cathy by slapping them around, setting rules(which are really just carefully disguised punishments, Cathy tells us), and occasionally bugs them by sneaking up on them and hissing sinners, without even telling them how they are sinning. She epitomizes the cliched religious villain, though the religious aspects are so poorly done they should have been cut. Finally, about half way through the film they are, but grandmother only gets worse by poisoning the children's food. Yet another potentially interesting film aspect ruined, as we soon see that Grandmother's poisoning involves her carefully sprinkling arsenic onto doughnuts, and the arsenic is pouring from a beautiful silver jar. Would people really go through the trouble of making poison look pretty? Logic is not a strong factor to this film, and it makes it pretty hard to taking this one seriously, though it is entertaining in a bad way. I'm sure the book is not, or if it is, why is it acclaimed? I must read it.

Downright painful. It's really nothing more than an incest sex story soft-core porn. First, the Dad brings home the daughter a special gift and let's her know she's extra special. Then they kill him off (5 minutes in to the film) and the family moves back with the crazy grandparents in a Transylvanian-type mansion where the grandmother strips the mother down to her panties and whips her in front of the grandfather... the reason?? Her husband was her uncle. Yes folks, the kids are inbred. Then, the grandmother makes a big deal about the kids sleeping in the same bed. Finally the girl (who's supposed to be like 11 or 12 or something) practically masturbates in the bathtub while the brother sponges her down. Creeeeepy.... Oh, and the acting on a porno would be a step up from this travesty of a film. "}]
