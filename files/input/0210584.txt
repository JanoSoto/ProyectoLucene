[{"Title":"The tap dance kid is footloose Down Under","Date":"29 September 2005","Score":"13 out of 17 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Drama, Romance","Review":" Most of the negative comments about this film seem to come from its birth place, Australia. Frankly, Bootmen is not a horrible movie by any stretch of the imagination. The film shows some originality in the way the director Dein Perry sets the film in the steel works factory that is about to close and having Sean and his mates practice in another abandoned place that seems to be saying a lot about how industries do away with people that have given their best to make them better.Adam Garcia, playing Sean, is one of the best things in the film. The other asset is Sam Worthington, who plays Mitch, the brother that seems to attract trouble wherever he goes. Also, Sophie Lee, as the brothers' love interest makes an effective contribution to the movie.The dancing numbers reminded us of Stomp, the musical that has been playing here for a long time now, in that unusual ways of tap dancing are practiced on the most unconventional ways, which makes Bootmen more likable.The best way to watch the film is to sit back, relax, and let it unfold, as it will win the viewer over with the inspired tap dancing.

The fact that it was shot in Newcastle and features a few Newcastle actors only increased my interest. As a local it was fantastic to see our often stereotyped city (we are the sixth largest Australian city) look as good as it does. They didn't just focus on the normal shots of the steel works or the beach, and they used references to places in Newie that only we could get. As a tap-dancing fan it was wonderful to see tap making its way into the cinema in a non-Fred Astaire way. As a movie fan it was great to note that something I assumed to be a chick-flick was actually a very blokey film with a bit of dancing thrown in. Perry and the crew have done a magnificent job in not only opening up the eyes of the world to tap-dancing they've also been wonderful in showing everyone a different side to Newcastle, while still maintaining what we are really about.

According to my mate Dr Sebastian who spends a lot of time down under this is a laughably cliched stereotype and Australians are the nicest friendliest people on Earth . Mind you Seb is a six foot three Scotsman so everyone`s nice to him .You can see what I`m getting at about stereotypes though ? because strangely BOOTMEN does feature the type of Aussies who take a drink and commit crimes and enjoy the sound of knuckle against cheekbone . Even stranger despite the mythical portrayal of Australians in this movie no one really gives the main protagonist Sean a hard time for wanting to become a dancer even though he works at a steel mill . A worker at an Australian steel mill wants to become a dancer and no one accuses him of being  A bloody wooftah  , now that takes some swallowing and I guess that`s why some people dislike BOOTMEN , it is slightly obvious that the story was written around the dance sequences but it could have been far worse , it could have been a plagaristic cross between THE FULL MONTY and BILLY ELLIOT  or a camp Baz Luhrmann type production but at least BOOTMEN has an identity all of its own . BOOTMEN is a simple story of people trying to pursue their dreams , it`s funny , romantic , sometimes gritty and foul mouthed , sometimes violent but always entertaining with an absolutely brilliant dance sequence at the end and is by far the greatest Australian film since ROMPER STOMPER.If you`ve ever seen the dance troupe Stomp or these idents on BBC1 featuring the dancers and thought  Hmm that lifts the spirits  then you`ll enjoy this movie .

There is nothing, plotwise, that hasn't been done before and the characters are all tried and tested stereotypes. Cinematography is solid and production quality is safe. There is a fair degree of bad language, which seems a touch out of place given that this film will appeal to a lot of young dance students.

It is one of the few Australian Films I have seen that, either purposefully or not, looks more like a Hollywood flick, and perhaps coincidentally it ranks lower than most Aussie films on my list. The characters are developed haphazardly, and the tone of the movie follows a similar chaotic path, with excellent dancing not quite making up for a weak script and a feeble, unoriginal plot. Although at parts moving or amusing (or occasionally both at once) the film as a whole lacks focus, and it could be seen as a way to bring the Directors talent as a choreographer into the limelight. Impressive dancing, but otherwise nothing special, and towards the end it appears to lose touch with reality.

The theatre they used when Adam's character was in Sydney was really the Civic Theatre which is located in Newcastle.Sophie Lee has come a long way the past few years and definitely deserves higher recognition - I'm not saying this because she is also a Newcastle girl but I thought she outshone Kate Winslet in Holy Smoke and gave Toni Collete a run for her money in Muriel's Wedding and it was a shame she didn't have a bigger role.Australian movies are really hit or miss and this is definitely a hit, along with The Dish which was released around the same time.

When I tap, I feel I can do anything!  You're mad!  MAD!  People just don't TAP that way!  But don't you SEE?  Tapping isn't just about steel-tipped shoes, it's about LIFE!  This is our chance to DO something!  This is our chance to make a difference!  I love you!  I love you, too!  People just aren't ready for your kind of tap!  I don't care!  I'll show them.  I'll show them all!Okay, so I'm making these lines up.  (It's amazing how quickly they come to you, once you let them.)  But if these particular lines don't appear in Bootmen, I suspect it's due to an oversight.  They might as well.  And I remember an I love you line, which, in context - there's nothing wrong with the three words per se - may well be the most embarrassing thing Sophie Lee has ever been called upon to say.Wanna hear a rich irony?  Sean tries out his first-draft choreography on his performers, and one of them says (and I paraphrase), Look - I know why this isn't working.  It's just a collection of the same old tap routines that have been done a thousand times before.  We're doing them funny hats, that's all.  Sean sees the light and comes up with something NEW.  He uses the SOUL of the steelworks to come up with a fresh, vibrant, STEELY kind of tap...  I don't know why I'm being sarcastic; this is exactly what he should be doing.  The irony is that Bootmen is exactly the same kind of let's-put-on-a-show movie that's been done a thousand times before.  It's just a new kind of show.  Granted, working class tap dancing may be fresh - although we aren't allowed to get a sense of its freshness - but none of this freshness or vigour seems to have infected the rest of the film.About that comment (I'm not sure whether or not it's an actual line from the film) - It's been done a thousand times before... this is never a fair criticism by itself, any more than It will be done a thousand times in the future is.  The trouble with Bootmen is that it's stale, in the way that some bread is stale.  You don't have to research the history of a stale loaf of bread to tell that there's something wrong with it; nor do you have to look at other loaves of bread.  The badness of stale bread is intrinsic to the loaf.  If Bootmen had been the only let's-put-on-a-show film ever made, it would STILL be stale.  Every bit as stale.  (Or, to look at it from another angle, if The Full Monty and In the Bleak Midwinter and Singin' in the Rain and Topsy-Turvy had each had a dozen almost indistinguishable clones, they would still be every bit as fresh.  But, alas, I was talking about Bootmen...)Here's all you need to know... Every second of screen time falls into one of three categories (1) the dance routines themselves, which are there for their own sake; (2) the backstage preparation; (3) all that personal relationships stuff, and my, isn't there a lot of it.  -Actually, I need to subdivide (1) - there's (1a), the few minutes of actual performed dance at the end, and (1b), the impromptu dance routines that people break into at such naturalistic prompts as, Show us what ya got.  Now here's the rundown.  (1b) is fun.  (1a) less so.  (2) is poorly done, but not actually painful.  But as for (3) ... boy, do we have to cringe our way through (3).

Sean set off from Newcastle to Sydney like he was going to the end of the world, when it's a journey he would do on his motorbike in well under the running time of the movie. He's landed a part performing in the chorus of a big dance show there - his big break towards stardom. Does his beloved Linda drive down in that fast sports car of hers to see him on opening night? No, she sits at home by the phone waiting for him to ring. Aaaaaaaaaaah! Sophie Lee as bimbo extraordinaire! Guess all she had to do was act naturally.But it was all part of a plot that was totally pathetic. Just not credible. Right from the start of the movie the horrid nasty baddy and his gang of thugs had been in an escalating crime war with Mitch as their sole adversary. And this ends with a scene on a high overhead gantry with the baddie drawing a vicious knife and trying to gut the unarmed Mitch like a fish. Yet he is apparently horrified, remorseful even, when Mitch falls to his death in trying to escape him. Strictly Ballroom wove a plot that had lots of elements of fantasy, but beautifully depicted them thus amidst the sequins and glitter. That was why it was able to succeed so very well as a dance movie with a story to tell and a tearjerker happy ending. Bootmen couldn't or wouldn't leave for single second the grim reality of its harsh meanstreets and decaying heavy industry backdrop, and asked us to accept strictly at face value a story that was just woefully full of holes.   1 point for the plot, 5 for the dancing.

His character goes threw many emotional climaxes, i'd have to say the scene where he confronts his brother about sleeping with his girl was strong but then he let himself down in the kiss-and-make-up-scene. Sophie lee also could have done better than the performance she gave in this film but with a script that lacks any character depth, she had to work with what was given to her. Sam Worthington, i say the same thing as i said about lee, you can't work to your full potential when the script is what lets you down.One thing you have to remember about this film though is that it's a dance film and in the dance department, it definitely doesn't let you down. the scenes where Sean is dancing around the steel works, works so effectively and was a creative idea for how he comes up with the idea of using the steel works in his put-on show. H aving the tap dances dancing to a band was amazing. It added way more ompphhh and sent shivers down my spine.Adam Garcia is one great dancer. it's the final live show that he could show off his tap dancing abilities ( and i've developed a major crush on him after that)) but then if you know about Adams dancing background (saturday night fever, hot shoe shuffle anyone?) then you would expect to see him burning up the floor and for you ladies, mind boggling eye candy.Overall, this film doesn't have action but it does have it's funny moments (aussie humor) definitely it's sad monument, and it really is just a coming-of-age-with-tap-shoes-on film.

It's a real shame writers/producers limit the viewers to the few who do!I think this movie should be reshot (even using the same actors/actresses) and can the vulgarity so the dance can shine through and reach an entirely different generation of kids with the verve of this wonderful dance presentation. This dancing could set their feet as well as their souls on fire!  "}]
