The film is one of the BEST FILMS of my lifetime.  It will always represent to me, the dream that is America.I think it's because the emotions of the film are so universal, that I count it as one of my favorites. I am male, I am hispanic, I came to the United States when I was 13 years old.  I felt alienated, lonely and hopeless, could anyone really understand all that I wanted to do, all that I wanted to become.  How do you reconcile your cultural roots, with wanting to fit into the American Dream.I try to watch The JOY LUCK CLUB as often as I try to read the book.  Because it reminds me that we are all connected in so many ways. That our dreams and desires are not all together different. that Love reaches beyond race, beyond politics and beyond time.when I saw this film I thought, The Academy of Arts and Sciences would gush over it.  But it never reached the kind of acclaim it truly deserved.  I think it's because most film makers field of personal experience limited in reaching and feeling.  Most of the Academy comes from back grounds that didn't see struggle, that doesn't see the world in unison, but in carefully separated categories. This to them was not a human experience film, it was a film for a minority group.  But, while The JOY LUCK CLUB is life affirming to some, to those who have lived the similarities, it is life changing.

It is one of the best movies I have ever seen in my life. It combines the stories of mothers and daughters to tell one sincere story of friendship. It is one of the finest pieces of acting collaberations among an ensemble cast. It also combines foriegn film with American film in a way giving it a new style. This movie is almost ten years old. For me it never gets old and the stories are also fresh. I like the set up of the movie or the sequence rather, better than the book. It seemed to make more sense. It also has the movie and book on the same level of unique style and everlasting stories to go along with it. Many of the performances were powerful. Even those who only spoke the Chinese language in the film should have gotten awards for performances that made me laugh and cry. I would recommend this film to anyone who wants to see an honestly good film without the Hollywood hype. Rent it, you won't regret it.

I have also read reactions to both.  Some really liked it and found it to be very real, while others hate it and object to the stereotype.  It seems to depend on whether you could relate to the stories, characters, or themes.I myself could relate very well to the stories, but that could be because I too have experienced the intergenerational and intercultural conflict as an American-born Chinese daughter with a very traditional Chinese mother. Many other American-born Chinese women who were born in the 1960s could relate to the stories very well also.  For us, we would start crying as soon as the first sentence is made.I didn't experience everything that June, Rose, Lena, or Waverly went through, but on a grander scale, they are dealing with issues that I have struggled with as well.I understand that there are other women who could relate to it as well, and these are not Chinese women--or even Asian women.  Perhaps Amy Tan has touched on universal themes that women of other nationalities could relate to.On the other hand, I have found that some people who are ten years younger than me didn't like the book/movie too much and found the characters stereotypical or unrealistic.Some Caucasian males didn't like this book/movie either, and again it comes back to them not being able to relate to it.I understand another user's comment about the negative portrayal of Asian men, but this person has forgotten about June's father who was portrayed as a very likeable man who was trying to bridge the gap between his wife and his daughter.  As for his objection of the daughters marrying Caucasian wives, he needs to realize that there are other issues/reasons involved and it's not because Chinese-American women like them hate Chinese men.In short, this movie is very good at portraying the intergenerational and/or intercultural conflict between people who are caught between two cultures. Women like me have cried while watching this movie because the issues have been very real for us.  For those who could not relate to it or cannot see the reality of it, then this movie would not be for them.

It's a story of the generation gap that inevitably occurs between immigrant mother's and their daughters who were brought up surrounded by different values. Each mother strives to raise her children in a way that will bring them success and joy in life. Each hopes to free their offspring from the pains they themselves had to endure. It is also about the Chinese way of pushing a child to be the best, and gives insight into a mother's need to see her own struggles amount to something great in her daughter. However, this is not just about Asians. It is about all parents hopes and all children's frustrations with fulfilling those dreams. In America the story of the first generational gap is a very real and painful one. It happens for boys as much as girls, and I know a lot of men who relate to this film despite it's inherent chick flick nature. It celebrates the need to keep your roots and history alive, even if you let go of certain traditions that you were not born into. The women in the film often make hard choices. Many of them folly and sin, but it is not a film about forgiving them so much as it is about the lasting effect of the choices we make. Everyone should see this film. It's one of the most honest human dramas out there.

But somehow they did it, seamless weaving in and out of the characters' reminiscences. Joy Luck Club could reasonably be described as a chick flick - it is, after all, a film about a bunch of women and their feelings - but that would be a disservice.  Chick flick has become a somewhat derogatory term, partially because it was a term created by guys who find women and their feelings annoying, but to a great extent because most movies in this class are shoddy pieces of tripe like Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood.  If movies of women and their feelings were all this intelligent, insightful and affecting I doubt anyone would have even coined the term chick flick.  This is a movie of honest emotion that leaves you with a sense of fulfillment, a rebuke to all those manufactured, syrupy women's movies that Hollywood churns out.

You know a film is well edited when the editing doesn't occur to you as you watch it.  It takes a special film to go beyond that and call particular attention to how well it's all put together.  But that's not only what makes this film great.This film is more or less told as eight small vignettes.  Usually in such a film, half to three quarters of them can be considered good.  In this film, the stories of all eight women are great.  They are well written, well acted, and tied perfectly into the frame of the story overall.  They are funny, dramatic and shocking all at the same time.  They are all interesting and very different from each other. The films' only weakness, in my opinion, is the bookends.  The story of the coming reunion of the three sisters.  The punch that's so prevelant in all the vignettes is just not there in either the writing or the acting. However, this is a great film, and one of the best of 1993.  While I don't think any of the actresses could warrant any Oscar attention on their own, it certainly was a snub that the film itself wasn't nominated, and particularly Wayne Wang, the director.  The Piano was a piece of garbage, and I cringe at the thought of it being mentioned in the same breath as Schindler's List and The Remains of the Day.  And The Joy Luck Club.

Although I do agree with some that the portrayal of men was sometimes rather harsh, but everyone must remember that this movie's focus is relating to WOMEN! Including that not all male characters were negative, this film is about women dealing with believing in themselves and their mothers. Take for example, Rose, her husband loved her for who she was, but she was caught up in the traditional Chinese ideal that a wife must be obedient and self-sacrificing. Not understanding, her husband, of course, felt alienated and strange towards her. There is one scene where he tries to get her to talk for herself, to make her stop groveling before him, but she refuses to feel that she deserves anything. Eventually, Rose's mother gets her to see this through her own personal history of finally standing up for herself, her mother, and a generation of future women.I am a first generation Chinese-American and the stories told by Amy Tan strongly empathized with me. These tales are a touching revelation of the tangible coldness that Chinese daughters and mothers often keep in their relationship. Although we may not always be able to say the things we mean or act the way we feel, there is that unspoken but often thought of love and connection between all mothers and daughters. This is especially apparent within the movie that accurately depicts the pain and anguish but above all hope that humans hold on to throughout their lives as a means to an end. I loved this movie that brought unhindered tears to my eyes and allowed me to see my mother through a different view. It is still difficult at times to remember that my mother has a story behind her tears and a history behind her bitterness, but at least I can understand that my mother only means well for me and my future, and I plan to make her proud.I am definitely not saying that this movie is for everybody, because apparently it is not, but see it and don't judge too quickly until you've let the true message of the film settle in. I would also like to say that those of you who disliked the film, please put reasons behind your complaints for thus far I have only seen a few negative comments that have made any sense to me.

One that springs to mind for me, right away, is that of a generation gap AND a cultural gap.  This is a story about Chinese-American girls, growing up in America, raised by women who came of age in Mainland China, decades earlier.  One interesting thought most of these Chinese mothers came to America, wishing to fight like a tiger for their daughters...........wishing that they could give their daughters a much better life (and a MUCH  LESS  PAINFUL life) than they had.  Unfortunately most of their daughters interpreted their tenacious desire to fight for them (and push them to excellence) as a lack of love hence the double-edged sword of giving their all for their daughters. I am all too keenly aware that this is what most people would call a chick flick.  Nevertheless, as a man, I loved it.  I enjoyed how the stories of the mother's and daughter's childhoods (and their younger years in general) were interwoven throughout the movie like a Chinese tapestry or quilt.  Moving in and out of the American and Chinese cultures made this even more interesting to watch.  Every tale, that each Chinese mother narrated, was like a work of art a work of art complete with flutes, violins and various types of Chinese instruments in the background.  Their tales were also frequently accompanied by breathtaking views of snowcapped mountains and the wide, open Chinese countryside (so very similar to what we have seen on sheets of rice paper or on porcelain plates).  There was also a lot of powerful energy in this film.  Not all of it was the negative energy of deep conflicts and emotional strife between mother and daughter.  Much of it was quite positive and invigorating the energy that filled the room of these daughters and mothers when they got together to CELEBRATE  LIFE at an extended family party...........The very moving and touching energy, that surged forth, when mother and daughter often came together, after years and decades of conflict..........and realized that they were on each other's team..........The tears of joy that often sprang forth, when a given daughter realized, for the first time, that her mother was not disappointed in her..........and that her own happiness was PARAMOUNT, in her mother's heart.In a small way, it did bother me that every single one of the Chinese mothers came from a dysfunctional family (and/or background).  I do realize, however, that the overall story would not have been anywhere near as riveting, had each daughter not had a mother who had to fight and claw her way to survival (and to sanity!).  I will say that, of all the mothers, Tsai Chin's Lindo Jon character was perhaps the most unforgivable role model for maternity.  Most of my friends, who have seen this movie, agree that she was almost HATEFUL in her attitude toward her daughter!  However, this part of the movie did help make the overall plot very interesting (and deeply charged with emotion!).  A few closing comments as a former student of Chinese History I really enjoyed seeing  some of the common Chinese familial traits played out in this movie respect for elders, honoring one's ancestors and being an obedient child.  Finally, I must compliment the casting director of The Joy Luck Club you selected some of the prettiest little girls to play the mothers and daughters in their earliest years.

I lost track of which person was telling their particular story at the moment. (There are eight stories woven into this two hour, 19 minute movie). I think it would be confusing to most one-time viewers to get confused here if you don't know the stories or the actors. It also got a little soap-opera-ish, too, but then again, this film was based on a best-selling book that was ready primarily by women.On the second viewing, almost two years later, I liked it a lot more and upgraded my star rating considerably. It's still a chick flick and a feminist one. The young women are that way, the Americanized women, while their mothers, those all born in China, are quite. The older ladies are a bit too strict and their daughters are a bit too liberal. That included general morals and language - a big difference between the two generations and cultures. The feminist angle I didn't like was that in almost every relationship the man is painted as the bad guy (the abuser, the non-loving type, etc.) That kind of story bias was too much.The more memorable of the stories turned out to be the ones with the older women, such as the one who left her two babies at the base of a tree, or the one who had to marry a young boy.For me, the best part of the film was the cinematography. There were some beautiful scenes and great colors bright oranges, yellows, reds and browns. Some of the young women were beautiful, too. The lady narrating in the beginning, June (Melanie Chang as a nine-year- old and then Ming-Na as an adult) was very appealing and had a great voice. Her story is the one that begins and ends the film. That ending, by the way, is almost guaranteed to bring a few tears.Overall, a wonderful visual movie and a great venue for Chinese-American actresses, all of whom I found fascinating to watch.

But best of all are the performances by the actresses in the leading roles, especially the older generation.  It is so rare and wonderful to see so many Asian actresses in a Hollywood production.However, this should have been a GREAT movie, but wasn't, mainly to a couple of flaws.  Firstly, the portrayal of most of the Chinese men in this film is very negative, such as the philandering rich Chinese husband with four wives, or Ying Ying's cold penny-pinching husband who adds up everything she spends on an adding machine.  Some Chinese men might have been offended by these characterizations, but I would have been willing to overlook them, in light of the positive roles for the Chinese women.  However, there was one cruel unnecessary line of dialogue, spoken by the Rose character, that was a direct personal insult to an individual who wasn't in the film, but should have been.

Overall, it definitely did the book justice. The symbolism and wonderful cinematography all provide a realistic view of the lives of these women, and if anything, it opens your eyes to Chinese culture.Often harsh and poignant, this movie provides the stories of four Chinese - American daughters and their mothers which reveal conflicts between Eastern and Western civilization, but also show the special bond between the mothers and daughters. It is great to see how each character develops and it really goes into detail with each character's traits. The strangest thing was, the images on the screen were almost exactly what I had imagined when I was reading the book. I think that definitely says something good about the cinematography, anyway!I would recommend this film to anyone - no, it is not a chick flick - it is a deep exploration of these women's trials and tribulations. However, DEFINITELY read the book, as a few stories are omitted in the movie. You'll love the book even more than the movie.

When she dies June discovers that two twins that her mother abandoned as babies are actually alive and not dead as feared.  On the even of her trip to meet them in China, the mothers and their daughters reminisce over their lives as children and as adults, strengthening their bonds as mothers and daughters.I always had the idea in my head that this film was about 3 hours long and all subtitled.  Don't know where I got that from but it kept putting it low on my list of things I'd like to see. This week I hadn't really watched anything so I thought I'd give it a try and was instantly surprised to hear English dialogue and notice that it is only just over two hours.  These are trivial things but it is funny what can put you off something.  The film instantly sets out it's stall to be a potential `chick flick' by focusing on the hardships and lives of 2 generations of 8 women.  I hate that phrase (`chick flick') but it is what came across to me from the first 20 minutes.Happily sticking with it revealed that the film manages to avoid the sentimental excesses of those films usually put under that category.  Although the film has enough tragic life experiences to keep a soap opera going for months, all crammed into 8 individuals, it still manages to be controlled and down to earth.  What I mean by this is that the emotion was involving but not forced by the use of tear jerking music or trivialised by being portrayed as mushy or sentimental.  It was from the heart.The cast do well.  No one person really stands out but as an ensemble everyone works. Due to this I won't go into individual performances but there are plenty of well known faces and I did get a little distracted doing `where do I know him/her from' in my head.  Some of the cast were so into their characters that this wasn't a problem but in some cases they didn't grip me and my mind wandered.With a smaller budget, lower production values and an all white cast this would have been just another TVM tearjerker.  However as it is this is a well put together film whose polish shows through in the fact that the emotion always stays relateable (no matter how tragic the events) and never really becomes as cloying or sentimental as many TVM's would have turned this.

It is based on the novel of the same title by Amy Tan, who also co-wrote the screenplay with Ronald Bass.The film was directed by Wayne Wang.The film takes place in present-day San Francisco, concentrating on a group of late-middle-aged Chinese women. Ever since arriving in the United States after World War II, the women have gathered weekly to play mah-jongg and to tell stories, regaling each other with tales of their children and grandchildren, giving each other a sense of hope and renewal in the midst of poverty and hardship. The Joy Luck Club is made up of four women -- Suyuan, Lindo, Ying Ying, and An Mei. But when Suyuan dies, the three surviving members invite Suyuan's daughter June to take her place. Along with the daughters of the other members -- Waverly, Lena, and Rose -- June is a Chinese-American with only a passing interest in her rich cultural heritage. But through vignettes that switch back and forth in time, the daughters begin to appreciate the struggles of their mothers to start their families in the optimistic promise of the United States.The movie gives refreshing -- and bittersweet -- dimension to the age- old clash between generations.Four different actresses play the aunties in their youth, which sometimes keeps us struggling to keep the stories straight. That we do is a tribute about the miscommunication that separates one generation from another.Also,it is one of the most touching and moving films ever released on screen that it deserves every tear it wrenches from your eyes.Most of all,it is a great adaptation of a best-selling novel.

Understandably this epic story becomes all too melodramatic in its unfolding of maternal traumas throughout the older women's years (such as infanticide and the dishonor suffered by unwilling concubines), but it is still worth viewing.

It was brushed off with she would not tell me, she only said she'd been married to a bad man in China.Amy Tan had creative control over every aspect of this picture. Tan may have been trying to keep attention away from Nuyen, fearing that she might win a Supporting Actress award and distract people from the film itself (or, Nuyen thinks, from Amy Tan herself!). Thus, Nuyen's best scene -- in which she -does- explain her life to her daughter -- was left on the cutting room floor.If Nuyen is right, Tan doesn't appear to have considered that leaving that scene in -- giving Nuyen's great acting a chance to showcase Tan's great screenwriting ability -- might have inspired some nominations for things like Best Screenplay or even Best Picture.This is to say nothing of Irene Ng's sparkling portrayal of teenage Lindo's brilliantly clever ploy for getting out of -her- rotten marriage, or the amazing performance of Yi Ding as little An-Mei.

We live close to San Francisco, so this is a film I appreciate.The film is about the relationships between mothers and daughters so it goes beyond just being about Asian Americans. It is about any mothers with daughters, and the trials of growing up in a mother's influence/shadow.

The few scenes that may appear to be over-done are actually very on target with regard what I observe of this precious ethnicity. My female in-laws all giggle about how believable this film is.

The cultural differences separating each of the quartet of traditional Chinese elders from their modern American children give each episode a special poignancy, but while criss-crossing two hemispheres and three generations the film is forced to lean too heavily (out of necessity) on the crutch of constant voice-over narration, presumably quoted straight out of the book.It looks and sounds at times too much like a well-produced television drama (full screen VHS and DVD versions were 'formatted to fit your TV screen', to no real noticeable effect). In fact the film might have worked better had it actually been expanded into a mini-series. Each of the separate relationships deserves a full movie by itself, and cramming so many memorable biographies (by so many different narrators) into a single two-hour movie only dilutes the emotional impact of each story.

The same goes with their on-screen mothers, played wonderfully by Kieu Chinh, Tsai Chin, France Nuyen and Lisa Lu. Their mother-daughter and friend-friend chemistry together were inspiring and a joy to watch and experience.This movie made me appreciate my Chinese heritage as it delves upon another's struggles and perseverance through the culture's past, present and future, and explore how one can cement his/her relationship with one's child or parent and learn from each other to better their lives. The scene where Kieu Chieh's character Suyuan flees China from the Japanese occupation, pushing a cart with her newborn twin daughters and a handful of her belongings in it was such a strong scene that it put tears to my eyes. The cart collapsing with her daughters and belongings spilling out furthered the emotion.

I must say that some of the cultural and historical background is true and I will admit that some of these do reflect reality in China or Asian cultures, but it is overly dramatized and exaggerated. The plot has so much room to play with that I expect to have more breadth and diversity. It just seems unrealistic that all 8 women have such tragic lives. It bothers me so much that this is the way China and Asian cultures are being portrayed in a movie that is popular in the west.In the scene where Waverly brings her white fiancé Rich home, Rich didn't know some Chinese dining etiquette. When Waverly's mother said her fish is not salty, she was being humble and actually wanted everyone to praise it. Rich actually criticized the dish and just poured soy sauce on the fish. It hardly seems like something anyone with decent manner would do. The character of Harold, who is Lena's husband and splits the cost of everything they share, and Lin-Xiao, who is Yingying's ex-husband and abused her and openly brought his mistress home, both seem overly flat, dramatized and unreal. There are also many noticeable flaws in the plot. For example, Ted became bored in his marriage with Rose because Rose has lost herself and let Ted makes all the decisions. Ted was going to divorce her for another women. During the divorce, Rose realized her mistakes and yelled at him Get out of my house and the next thing we know they are back together. The film never explained how the 4 women came to the US too.Besides the plot, the acting, filming, editing, etc. are actually good.

They did not have their own identities, yet blamed their mothers, yet living the american dream they had choices. Meanwhile the mothers accepted their choices yet knew their identities. The mothers even in their advancing age did not change because they despite circumstance made choices (they did the best they could). The daughters had choices...they discovered them with time.

I bought it for my wife a few years ago and we have watched it several times now. It's one of her faves. I think I can make reasonably critical remarks because I've been over the same territory so much. Let's get the criticism out of the way from the beginning. I have two main objections. One, this is a woman's movie that is unapologetically pro-female and seriously anti-male in character. When the men aren't being portrayed as egotistical, selfish, and cruel, they are annoying or clueless. It gets a bit tiresome. In fact, one is surprised that a couple of them make the cut over the long haul because these ladies don't think much of men, in general, that is, unless they are completely domesticated and worshipful. Second is Oliver Stone's unrelenting attack upon the viewer's emotional homeostasis. He comes at you again and again, dragging an emotional response out of you over and over without significant letup. In so doing, he goes over the top a bit, but most of the feeling generated is honest and genuinely acted. One definitely gets the sense that the Chinese (or at least this group of them) are very sentimental people, which doesn't quite jibe with their rather stern and inscrutable image in the world at large. One of my favorite scenes was the one at the beauty parlor between Auntie Lindo and her daughter Waverly, where Waverly confesses that even a look from her mother used to make her cry herself to sleep. Lindo's reaction to this otherwise troubling info was a simple, Now you have made me happy. Then there's the scene in the kitchen after the dinner party between June and her Mom (who sad to say wasn't long for this world). That's where she tells June that for her she has, only hope, assuring her that, I see you. Both of these scenes are very touching. The finale, where June arrives in China to see her long lost half-sisters is a real tear-jerker, as well. Some of the scenes in this movie were rather troubling, however. At the top of the list would have to be the young Ying Ying's sacrifice of her infant son to get back at her selfish and cruel husband. He certainly deserved to be hurt, but to take it out on the baby boy? That I couldn't forgive her for. The same woman, in middle age, was understandably critical of her daughter's unbelievably cheap and pompous husband, but for her to judge him so harshly after the terrible thing she had done in her youth was hypocritical. An interesting sidelight is that this actress was the same young lady who played Leat, the beautiful native girl in the movie South Pacific.Speaking of that, this flick was an exploration of the natural beauty of oriental women. Which one of them was the most alluring? It was quite a contest. I'd say the two most beautiful women in the cast (at least of the older generation) were the young Ying Ying and An Mei's mother, the lovely woman whom we first saw wearing a fashionable hat, who became a fourth wife and didn't know her worth, and finally who committed suicide for her daughter's sake. Less for their absolute beauty than their special appeal was Lindo's mother in China and June's mother in America. Among the daughters, it was a tossup. Probably either Waverly or Lena was the most attractive, but June had a sensuous quality and certainly gave them a run for the money. Rose, although somewhat less beautiful, was also appealing. You can't go wrong with Joy Luck Club if you appreciate the beauty of Chinese women. Just make sure you have something absorbent handy when you sit down to watch because you're going to need it.

It is fair to say that culture is learned, shared, and worked on down thru the ages. The culture of the Chinese woman is a work of art. They learn so many things from their mothers and grandmothers, etc. that it is somewhat impossible for the daughters in this story to loose all of their heritage. With what each of their mothers went thru, they have such a rich heritage to pass on to their children. The men in this book play a very important part also, they are like the sidelines of the story. In China, the father is important, but not as regarded as the mother. Women in China, even though they are sometimes seen as the lowest have a great influence on their husbands and their children.

Not only that, but it was a classic, apparently! I can't believe I didn't know that. Anyway, I decided to give it a try. Like a prologue before I start with the book itself.I didn't like the biases that it gave to all of the daughter's husbands. It was like, somehow it showed that all Chinese men were cruel. I'm sure that not EVERY man in China is like that (or are they?)! That biased opinion of men threw me off. I also got confused with all the Chinese names and the many characters, though it was easy to understand the plot of the movie.What I liked about this movie was the hope that it gave. Friendships can last. I'm not sure if I've found friends that would stick with me until I'm old and gray. I can only hope so. This movie shows that it is possible for it to happen. The relationships shown between mothers and daughters were done splendidly. The last scene with June and her mother was sad. Granted, I didn't really feel any emotion, but I could tell somehow that it was supposed to be a heartbreaking moment.Everyone was also interconnected, somehow. It was like watching those romance films like Love Actually or Valentine's Day. The only difference was that the main topic of The Joy Luck Club was about family (specifically mother-daughter) love.I was expecting a lot, due to all the reviews that I've seen/heard. From friends to parents to adults to online reviews-- everyone said it was a great movie and it made them cry! I was wondering why I wasn't crying even in the last 5 minutes of the film. Either something's wrong with me or it's really just the movie. Or maybe it was just the time of the day. I felt that I wasn't concentrating much on it.

The twin sisters, in fact, were thought to have been dead for decades, as their mother, Suyuan Woo (Kieu Chinh) was forced to leave them, as infants, by a roadside because she was too sick and weak to carry them and had no automobile or other transport. For years, Suyuan wondered what became of these babies she unwillingly gave up, and it haunted her up until the end of her life. Only now, four months after her death, have the 2 women been located, and June, both with joy and trepidation, is going to meet them and tell them about their mother.Up until today's party, June believed that she really didn't know or understand her late mother. She bristled as a child at her mother's insistence that she learn to play piano and compete in talent shows at school. June believed that Suyuan was disappointed in her daughter's life, her career path, her choices, and felt inferior to the daughter of Suyuan's best friend Lindo Jong (Tsai Chin).But Lindo's daughter Waverly Jong (Tamlyn Tomita), as uppity as she could be towards June both before and after adulthood, did not have the easiest time with her mother either. A chess prodigy at age 7, Waverly felt constantly pressured and painfully embarrassed by Lindo's constant bragging about her daughter's extraordinary talents. The generation gap and cultural differences cause more than a few verbal spats between them, and Lindo feels as though Waverly is ashamed of her for being Chinese. Lindo's own history with her mother comes into the equation. At age 4, Lindo is betrothed, and at 14, forced to marry a 10 year old who, naturally, is not sexually mature enough to be a husband. Lindo is the one who is blamed by her surly old mother-in-law of course. It is not until young Lindo cleverly schemes her way out of the ridiculous marriage that she finds happiness, though it is not known if she ever saw her mother again.Intertwined into this happy gathering celebrating June's journey to China are the stories of 2 more women, Ying-Ying and her daughter Lena St. Clair. At 16, Ying-Ying (France Nuyen) falls madly in love with the local ladykiller Lin Xiao (a dubbed Russell Wong), only to find out shortly that he is an abusive, hateful cad who brings women into their home at all hours. Ying-Ying's heart is broken, but when she accidentally drowns their infant boy, it is shattered, and for a few years, she lives in a state of mental catatonia. After her mother's recovery later on, Lena, the daughter (Lauren Tom) finds herself in a rather odd marriage to an accountant (Michael Paul Chan), based more on mathematical equality than love and affection. Ying-Ying, knowing her daughter is heading for a life of misery and lovelessness, intervenes.The other friend of Suyuan is An-Mei Hsu (Lisa Lu), and her daughter Rose (Rosalind Chao). Rose's once happy marriage to Ted Jordan (Andrew McCarthy) is ending, and An-Mei sees a disturbing pattern of behavior in her daughter that reminds her of her own mother (Vivian Wu). If a person feels they are of little value compared to someone else, it is easy to take advantage of them and abuse their goodness. An-Mei recalls her mother's terrible life sixty years earlier, first widowed by An-Mei's father and then the victim of one of the most evil conspiracies I've ever seen in film, and finally (and most horribly), disowned by her own parents. And An-Mei desperately explains to Rose that she must stand up and be counted instead of letting people walk all over her. The outcome of this story is on the upbeat, thankfully, otherwise I would have said it was the most bittersweet of all the stories.But it's not. The most haunting story in the film is that of the late Suyuan. War has broken out and she hastily gathers her most important belongings and her precious twin daughters. Without a car, she is forced to carry them in a wheelbarrel for miles and miles. She is weak and feverish, and eventually, the wheels of the wheelbarrel break and she tries in vain to carry the babies in her arms. Her strength gone, she leaves her little girls on the side of a rural road, praying that her note of instructions will be read and that she will see her children again.But she does not. Suyuan dies not knowing if her 2 girls lived beyond their infancy. There are few situations in movies that I've found sadder than this one, but Suyuan's daughter June, taking the place of her mother, goes to China and fulfills her late mother's cherished dream come true.The emotions of this film are almost too rich at times, especially with regards to Ying-Ying's, An-Mei and her mother's, Rose's, and above all, Suyuan's life stories. There will always be those who think of this film as too corny or just another chick flick. Me, I don't mind OD'ing on emotion. If you're like me, you'll love this film for years to come.

Wayne Wang's touching film, based on Amy Tan's novel, is about four women, who were born in China and later came to America, and their daughters. Among these eight women mingle countless friends and relatives, to the mise-en-scene's maximum scenery capacity, in peripheral branches of life. Actually, those scenes are the biggest weaknesses of the film, as their interjecting party jest is so transparently scripted that we want only the bottom line of the scenes. But what is about to be dissolved are the beginnings of the women, the stories of how they were born and grew up in a time and culture so far apart from the one in which they live now.The club of the title is a circle of elderly Chinese ladies who meet weekly to play mah jong, and trade stories of their families and grandchildren. All have made ruinous paths from pre- revolutionary China to the privileged homes in San Francisco where they meet. But those old days are not frequently talked about, and often the entire reality of them is not revealed.In a framework of flashbacks, the secrets and stories of all four of the aunties are unraveled. We see that the China of the 1930s and 1940s, before the Revolution, was an inconceivably dissimilar world than it is today. Women were not considered too much. Those with resilient spirits and wills were regarded even less than the impressionable, submissive ones. Life was worthless, no more than in wartime. A mother's ability to love her children was doubted. In plenty of instances, all-consuming dilemmas from those hard days still find their echoes in succeeding generations The potent reality of Amy Tan's story is the lack of understanding between cultures that make the capability of the mothers to identify with their westernized daughters rely on things that have never been clearly vocalized.How, in one instance, could the narrator's mother have told of deserting her first-born twin girls by the roadside? Her mother, ill and emaciated, was certain she should die, and believed her girls would have a better likelihood of living if they were not compromised by the bad luck of a deceased mother. Other stories are just as, if not more, agonizing to Americanized ears. There is the auntie who becomes the fourth wife of a wealthy man, and when she gives birth to the son he wished for so much, the child is taken from her by the second wife.In America, the mothers find it difficult to get their minds around the paths their daughters are taking. Some marry whites, who have deplorable etiquette. They move out of the old neighborhood into houses that seem too cutting-edge and frigid. One daughter gives up on ever pleasing her mother, who carps on everything she does.This movie was produced by Oliver Stone, who himself at one time was an astute and scrappy filmmaker who turned out films with cross-cultural themes like this one, such as his Vietnam trilogy, and Joy Luck's director Wang leaves us longing for the rawness of those films, but he captures Tan's story and keeps it pure within his medium. Her story is as respects Chinese and Chinese-American characters, but their stories are all-inclusive. Anyone, everyone, can relate to how the expectations of one generation can become both the obstructions and the awakenings of the next.

And those who are learn from their mistakes the hard way.The story is told in flashback format where each female character gets to narrate events in her life. Each mother and daughter thus get to temporarily consume the whole film, placing supporting male characters in the backseat. It is through to this intimate perspective that the film projects so much heart. We feel strongly for all the lead characters at some point because they are so honest and personal about their struggles.Thanks to this narrative device, The Joy Luck Club is also a beautiful portrayal of eras&#151;the 40s specifically, capturing the grace and heart of each decade but never letting the visuals overshadow the template story of that particular flashback. The mother-daughter relationship is usually in focus.

Does this film have three acts with plot twists on page 27 and page 87? Of course not. You could try to impose such a system - and I'm sure someone will - but what good would it do? The 3-act structure was never designed to help writers create a script. Its main use has been in demarcating a script after it's written.To see how this film is put together - and how you might write a film like it - we have to look at how the seven steps of every story interact with advanced structures.Every good story is founded on seven dramatic steps problem/need, desire, opponent, plan, battle, self-revelation, and new equilibrium. Sure enough, the first thing we notice when exploring the structure of The Joy Luck Club is that each of the eight stories works through the seven steps.Clearly some of the stories in the film fulfill the seven steps better than others. In general I found the mothers' stories more compelling than the daughters'. That may be due in part to the nature of history and geography. The mothers' stories take place in a brutally patriarchal China that is going through vast social and political upheaval. As a result, the mothers' stories have an epic canvas, and the problems these women face are more tragic and profound.The daughters, on the other hand, face the problems of the affluent American, of what has also been called the end of history. Without the burden of war, famine, and slavery, these modern women are free to concentrate on the psychological, on the painful bond between parent and child, or in these cases, mother and daughter.Indeed, the biggest flaw of the film for me is that the psychological needs and self-revelations of the daughters are virtually identical. Each woman feels inadequate in the face of her mother's expectations of her. And each learns, through the help of her mother, that she is a valuable and unique individual. I don't mean to diminish the importance of this problem or revelation. On the contrary, I was overjoyed to see such a powerful feminine perspective coming from a film industry that is so excessively masculine. But the sameness of the daughters' problems makes these parts of the film drag.To see the power of this film, we must go beyond a simple seven step breakdown of each of the eight stories. The trick to this film is the way these stories are tied together. And for this, we need to look at advanced structures.Unlike the linear seven or twenty-two step structure used by almost all Hollywood films to track a single main character, advanced films require specialized structures that can tie a number of characters and stories together into an organic whole. This is a complex subject; there are over 15 different advanced structures (see the Advanced Screen writing Class), and each serves a different thematic purpose.The Joy Luck Club uses a variation of the branching structure. In branching structures, the author sets up a main trunk, then takes the story out to a series of branches that can be organized in an infinite number of ways. The problem with branching structures is how do you sequence the branches to avoid repetition and the sense that the story is stopping and starting all the time.The Joy Luck Club strategy is to center the story within a communal event where we can meet all the characters and return after each story to get anchored. The main trunk of the story is provided by the desire line of June. She wants to visit her long-lost sisters in China. This single line creates the reason for the communal event, returns again and again throughout the story, and gives the story the ending that not only completes June's story but thematically completes the stories of the other seven characters as well.To finish reading this review and to find others, please visit http//www.truby.com/im_jlc.html "},{"Title":"Oscar material??

While it wouldn't have been the first time Hollywood recognized what is essentially a tawdry melodrama in that fashion, let's not confuse a bloated, ineptly manipulative movie with great art.It LOOKS great, though. Very high production values with great costumes and beautiful period sets. And the cinematography is gorgeous. All at the service of... ? A convoluted story, put in the hands of people that seem to have no idea how to tell it. Some good actors involved, though, gamely trying to make something of execrable material.

However, years from now it will ultimately end up seen in a negative light. This movie perpetuates White Knight archetypes along the same veins as Dances with Wolves, Last Samurai, and even Avatar, in which White males are positioned as the saviors for (backwards) foreigners.The author Amy Tan is a self-loathing, Uncle Tom writer. She never lived in Asia, exoticizes Chinese and Asian cultures, and improperly interprets Chinese terms and behaviors in all of her works. Her core reader demographic are White Americans who enjoy consuming self-righteous or superiority complex attitudes toward other cultures. Amy Tan, and other White worshiping Asian Americans like her (like Michelle Malkin), ultimately enjoy success and acceptance in America by pandering, or by demonizing Asian males.In terms of other identity or 2nd-generation American immigrant movies, one hardly sees Indian, Middle Eastern, South American, or other males portrayed in movies/books as negatively as Amy Tan portrays Asian males in all of her works. It also perpetuates damaging (and false) stereotypes regarding Asians and gender roles. When one looks at 2nd class status in Western religions, the lives of American women during the same time period, or the lower percentages of women in current political or corporate offices in America compared to China, the damaging stereotypes seem even more absurd.

Cliches and stereotypes such as the submissive asian wife/bride, the violent/abuse/asexual asian husband, the innocent masculine white man who saves the asian woman, and the wise old asian mother in law. This is the same vicious white racist tripe asian americans have to deal with daily in our lives. It's unfortunate Amy Tan had to sell out asians to write her book and get this movie made. It's also doubly unfortunate that these racist characterizations continue to haunt and burden most asians in the U.S. to this day. If you are looking for more realistic portrayals of asian americans look beyond the one sided portrayals and go watch some movies done by some real asians that haven't sold their souls to the White media yet.

These women are sell outs!!","Date":"14 February 2013","Score":"1 out of 8 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama","Review":" The Joy Luck Club should be condemned, not praised!! These women are sell outs!! First of all, why is the film only about the women? What about the Asian men? There isn't a single leading Asian male character! This film portrays marriage to an Asian man so negatively, while the rich white husbands are portrayed so positively. This is shocking because the Asian men I know are not like this at all. They are much more caring, strong and masculine than this. In fact, I have heard of many white husbands in the news who get drunk and beat or even kill their Asian wives. The Asian men I know are worthy candidates for marriage and are never aggressive toward women.These Asian mothers toiled through sweat, tears and blood, surviving a brutal war to come to America. And what do their daughters do in return? They forget all the hardship their mothers endured and marry the first rich white man they meet!! Instead of working hard for their money like their mothers, they want to be pampered by their rich white husbands and live an easy life of luxury through marriage! These women basically sell their bodies, beautifying themselves according to Western standards of beauty, while trying to sound educated so they can enter upper class society. They basically use their sexuality as a tool to move upward in social class through marriage. This, my friends, is a form of PROSTITUTION!! Whether these women are doing this consciously or subconsciously, they are engaging in prostitution. Is that really all an Asian woman has to offer society?This is an absolute disgrace and an incredible insult to all the real, hard working Asian-Americans in the United States, many who struggle in poverty and have no real voice in society. Any dignified Asian woman should realize that this film is Westernized propaganda, teaching Asian- Americans that white is better, that Asian men are terrible lovers, and to look the other way as their heritage gradually erodes. Tell me, how many objects of Asian cultural heritage can you find in the homes of their white husbands, even after marrying their Asian wives? Can you find even one painting or vase?This film teaches Asian women to scorn their Asian men, even their own fathers, and to learn to put up with their mothers, who are an obstacle to be dealt with. This film does not empower Asian-Americans. Instead, this film brainwashes them to gradually despise themselves as they develop a crippling inferiority complex and a bitter sense of self- hatred. To make matters worse, The Joy Luck Club portrays the so-called Asian-American experience solely through the voices of women, while completely ignoring the male experience. This film is damaging and should be viewed as a negative scar that Asian-Americans must move away from.

It is basically about four Chinese women and the lives of their daughters who are living in the United States and how similar they are. The film played out like a book, not like a movie, and has a Disney-like feel to it. It was incredibly boring for me but would most likely appeal to children under 10 and women over 40. It was basically trying to show that Asian women in the US can do very well when they try, and it did a good job of that. It was also funny at times. But otherwise, this was not very entertaining.
