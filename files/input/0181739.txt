Really, all they'd have to say is something like We just let the creators of 'Something About Mary' and 'Dumb and Dumber' make their own cartoon.  Brace yourselves.All complaints aside, and none of them are really the movie's fault, this is one of the most inventive animated films I've seen in a very long time.  The characters and backgrounds are allowed to look and move in ways that are downright refreshingly bizarre.  The visuals are very imaginative.  The humor, while funny, is still very much what you'd expect from a Farelly Brothers movie that takes place inside a very sick man, so I wouldn't recommend it to little kids or the weak of stomach.  If you have a little future A+P major, however, this is going to blow their mind.  Give it a look!

This movie gives a very imaginative way the body works to fight infection, as if the body was a city of people just like in the real world.

The majority of a crowd would think of adjectives like shocking and envelope pushing, to describe them, but the most shocking thing about Osmosis Jones, is the PG rating. Originally warranted a PG-13 rating, still a surprise from filmmakers whose credits include There's Something About Mary and Me, Myself, and Irene, the film finally earned the family friendly PG rating after it was subjected to a re-rating. Peter and Bobby Farrelly are known for their crude, rude, and disgusting sense of humor. Breaking free of their traditional styles, their focus is now on something a little more entertaining than gross-out humor-imagination.Directing a wildly amusing script by Marc Hyman, the Farrelly bothers are really on to something here. This is arguably their best film to date. Only There's Something About Mary stands up against Osmosis Jones, a film that jumps between live action and cartoon animation. It calculates each moment with the perfect timing. This is not a movie just for this kids, although it's perfectly appropriate for everyone in the family. This is a feast for anyone's imagination. Osmosis Jones creates a world we seldom see in the movies-inside the human body.Osmosis Jones is not an extremely funny movie. Only a handful of plentiful laughs occurs in the film. None of the gross-out humor works; the ideas are too jumbled within other ideas to payoff. Osmosis Jones does play with a lot of different humor types-from a clever Titanic joke that practically winks at the audience, to a laugh out loud performance by SNL veteran Molly Shannon. In Superstar Shannon proved to be a nuisance.  However, in this film she is a very welcome screen presence.Bill Murray needs to be in more movies these days. He still has the comic connection with the audience that carried Scrooged, his best film, to my list of all time favorites. He stars as Frank Detorri, a lazy, slothful zoo worker who would get life behind bars if hygiene was a law. His wife passed away because of a sickness that their young, but healthy and intelligent, daughter (Elena Franklin) believes evolved from poor eating habits.Frank eats something that contains a deadly virus, and it's up to his immune system to fight back. Osmosis Jones (voiced by Chris Rock) is one of those white blood cells who serves as a cop and must capture various villainous germs and viruses inside Frank. Although not a popular individual among the world of Frank, especially with the Mayor (voiced by William Shater), who is running for re-election very soon, he does have a crush on his assistant, Leah (voiced by Brandy Norwood). After the virus, named Thrax (voiced by Laurence Fishburne), accumulates villainous help and starts on a plan to kill Frank in a record time of forty eight hours,  Osmosis must work with a cold pill named Drix (voiced by David Hyde Pierce), to stop this monstrously powerful germ before it's too late for Frank and his daughter.The movie has some very clever material-various parts of the body represent neighborhoods in the City of Frank. For instance, the stomach is the airport with frequent departures to the colon. The Mafia relaxes in a steam room located in the armpit. Lawyers hang out in a hemorrhoid. When a zit pops up, it's seemingly the party room for the entire body, complete with a dance floor and strippers. Just simple content like that makes Osmosis Jones worth a watch. Even adults will enjoy the live action humor, as well as the film's zest, energy, and irony.In a time when summer movies are at an all time low, Osmosis Jones is here to save they day. It's one of the most clever films of the year.

Frank is seen as a huge city, such as New York or Los Angeles, and blood cells live out their daily lives.  The creative abilities of the creators of this movie seems endless even though it is limited to Frank's body.The characters are well drawn-out, and we even learn some of Jones' background (he lived in a certain area of the body and had hardly any education).  Drix is a product of a cold pill and assigned to help out around the place, and we learn much about him as he explains it all to Jones.The music in this movie isn't bad, but some of it didn't really match with the scenes.  Randy Edelman is the composer, and he doesn't do a bad job.  Even the rap and R&B music fit in and didn't sound too bad.All in all, Osmosis Jones is a great movie if you like animation (especially quick-action animated fighting scenes) and imaginative adventures such as these.

I think it's because how do you market a film like this? Since this takes place in the human body, there's all kinds of gross out humour in it. Some of it is too much for a PG rated film. That's my biggest problem with this film and why it wasn't marketed very well. It's gross. The scene where the nose dam breaks and a giant tidal wave of snot comes out is not what you're mean to see in a family film. Especially on the big screen. The scene where Frank vomits on the teacher and it is shown in a newspaper headline, we actually see the vomit. You don't show people vomiting in a PG film. Not only that, but it's part of the story. Making gross out gags part of the story is not a good idea.Also, the scene where the zit is ready to pop, we get a big giant close up on it which is enough to make anyone cringe. It's almost like Panty and Stocking with Garterbelt. A show loaded with gross out humour. But that was for adults. This is meant to be a family film.Now, the stuff I do like about it; the animation is great, it's very creative, (making the stomach the airport, the brain is city hall, the armpits are the steam room, I could go on)Laurence Fishburne was fantastic as Thrax. I kept forgetting it was him. Even if you don't like this film, you have to admit, Thrax is awesome. The music's great too.

What more can a person ask for in an animated world than Chris Rock as a white blood cell fighting off a nasty virus voiced by Laurence Fishburne. You also have Bill Murray in the live action side of the movie playing the unclean and gross, yet lovable Frank. David Hyde Pierce was also great as the Cold Pill named Drix.The animation is really cool, and I guess you could sort of say it's one of the last good animated movies made, seeing as the world has been taken over with CGI (Which is not necessarily a bad thing... it's just nice to see a traditionally animated movie.) I would also like to make comment on the designs of the inside of Frank... they were pretty cool.Of course there is lots of toilet humour and innuendo... but it's all in good fun. Some people may be a bit grossed out though during some scenes. I would recommend you don't let your kids watch this movie if they are under the age of about eight, as there are some dark themes involving death in it.Basically the animation is great, the characters are memorable and the movie is just a whole lot of fun. So the bottom line is if you see this in a shop... I would give a very high recommendation to rent or even buy this. It's just a really good movie.

And the other story line is where the animation takes part and recreates all the inside of Frank's body. This last one is the main part of the film, where we find our white blood cell cop Osmosis Jones (Chris Rock), followed by his partner Drix (David Hyde Pierce), a cold tablet, in order to prevent the body from the attack of the evil and powerful virus Thrax (Lawrence Fishburne). At first glance, the plot seems cheesy and typical, but the movie is an incredible combination of brilliant animation, incredible CGI, fantastic characters and dialogues and very funny gags. I never expected a cartoon movie from the Farrelly brothers. I mean, they have changed a lot their style from There's something.... You still find some scatological elements, but all the action in Frank's body is really good and surprising. For example, the neurones are represented as telephone operators, the stomach is like an airport, the bladder is like a harbor, you find turrets shooting snots inside the nose and so on.The two main characters Ozzy and Drix are quite similar to Mel Gibson and Danny Glover in the Lethal Weapon series. You know, two cops, one quite mad and risky, the other cold and more serious... Also you can find cameos from The Matrix and Titanic, but I would like to mention the appearance of KIDNEY ROCK in the film. Of course, we're talking about KID ROCK, the famous US rock star, considered by himself and lots of fans like the PIMP of the nation.

The music selection doesn't seem at all appropriate for the story's theme.  However, those elements and others, like the casting of Jones' voice, are rooted in Hollywood's recognition that it's trendy to be black and do urban things.

And it's good to see a traditionally animated movie during a time when computer-animated films dominate (though you can't deny they deserve to). Unfortunately for this film, every once in a while we have to suffer through the live-action parts, which are just plain disgusting and not very funny. Bill Murray's character is repulsive and he's very hard to like. He's not a good father and he doesn't treat his daughter very well. Even during the times when he tries to be nice, you still can't like the guy. He should stick to the usual Murray sarcasm and leave the gross-out humor to the professionals.The characters in the animated parts of the film, however, are all quite likable. Chris Rock is almost like Eddie Murphy, in the sense that he has the kind of voice that seems to fit animated movies even if this is only his first animated film. David Hyde Pierce is perfect as Drix the cold pill. You know, the stiff, professional type almost mirroring his character on Frasier, even if it's just his voice here. Osmosis Jones and Drix make a surprisingly good team. Laurence Fishburne makes Thrax's character quite villainous, with his low, evil voice. He makes his point clear that the Ebola virus is a case of dandruff compared to him, using only a large finger to send various cells frying.The script by Marc Hyman is original and witty with puns running a muck in this film. And the direction by the Farrelly brothers is nothing to write home about. It's mediocre at best.This movie is worth renting (maybe buying) if you've got 10-12 year-old boys in the house. It would certainly keep them occupied for an hour and a half. As for anyone over that age, well, it's just too silly to be appreciated the way kids appreciate things. As for me, someone over the age of 12, it's an okay animated feature that's about two-thirds animation and one-third live-action with the animated bits being good enough to deserve a so-so rating.

It makes your insides seem like an entire and adventurous different world, where in the film the white blood cells are law enforcement officers, lymph nodes are police stations, veins are highways, blood is water/lava, stomach is a bus station, a rowdy club is a pimple, and the germs and bacteria are the criminals.Marc Hyman wrote a fun, imaginative and adventurous script for the movie, cleverly depicting (in animation) how the human body fights infections and sickness. Brothers Bobby and Peter Farrelly did a fine job directing the film, making you suspend reality and imagining your body working like it is depicted in the film. Kudos to the team who did the animation work - bright, colorful and vibrant - nothing like some of those dull-looking and washed-out CGI animation you see nowadays. And, the live-acting and voice casting were great - realistic and believable.As this movie is raged PG, there is also quite a bit of bodily humor, puns and jokes, especially involving digestion, going to the restroom, passing gas, popping pimples from the face, food in the mouth..

I don't think it's the funniest (That award probably belongs to 'Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back'), but it's well written and performed, and the animation is wonderful.The film is a mixture of animated scenes and live action.  The live action (directed by The Farrelly Brothers) stars Bill Murray as Frank, a disgusting, slovenly pig of a father, who'll eat anything, including soft boiled eggs!  Even more gross, this particular soft boiled egg has spent some time in the paws and cage of a rather feisty monkey, and as a result a nasty virus enters Frank and begins to turn his body into mush.Cut inside Frank's body to The City of Frank an creatively animated city in which each body part is home to different citizens (The Mafia control the ingrown toenail).  Our hero is a white blood cell named Osmosis Jones (Voiced well by Chris Rock, far more entertaining here than in every other movie role I've seen him in), who has to stop the evil virus before it's too late.Here is the unusual film that is actual more childish and cartoony during the live action Bill Murray scenes (which feature a fight with a monkey, an exploding zit, and flatulence) and witty and adult in the animated scenes.  I saw it in a theater full of kids and I laughed more and louder at the in jokes and clever use of the locations in the city, than the children.  A lot of people throw around stuff like An adult movie disguised as a kids movie but this is really a case where the cliche is true.  This is a great movie to see on the big screen, but I'd recommend checking out the DVD, so you can take full advantage of the freeze frame function and check out the humorous signs and billboards and in jokes that are littered throughout Frank's body.  The summer's most underrated movie.

Audiences really did not get on board for this film, which uses traditional animation along with high-tech computer graphics to create a sprawling fantasy world set inside the body of a sloppy loser.  It's their loss.  Osmosis Jones is one of the funnier films to hit theatres this year, an endlessly clever and bizarre comedy with enough visual invention and screwy plot conceits for two films.Frank DiTorre (Bill Murray) is a slob.  Fat, balding, stubbly, he's like a big greasy eating and farting machine, to the neverending shame of his sweet young daughter (Elana Franklin).  One day, Frank finally puts his mouth where it doesn't belong, namely on a hard-boiled egg he fought from the gullet of an orangutan at the zoo.  As he slurps down the egg, we follow it into his body, where Thrax (voiced by a malevolent Laurence Fishburne), the monkey virus that hitched a ride on the egg, initiates his plan to kill Frank in 48 hours, a personal record.Frank's only defense?  Osmosis Jones (Chris Rock), a gunslinging, wisecracking white blood cell and the joke of the City of Frank Police Department.  He knows Thrax is on the attack, but he can't get anyone to listen to him.  His chief thinks he's a screwup, and the city's would-be brain trust, Mayor Phlegmming (William Shatner) is too busy trying to get re-elected by promising his voters a visit to the Buffalo Chicken Wing festival next week for some good binge eating.  The only one on Osmosis' side is Drix (David Hyde Pierce), a cold pill who's a bit stuffy himself. It's up to these two mismatched partners to track Thrax from the bowels to the brain and rescue Frank before he goes into a crash dive and realizes that he really, REALLY shouldn't have eaten that egg.Animation directors Piet Kroon and Tom Sito take us on a truly wild tour of the body, casting each organ in an amusing and oddly appropriate role. Frank's armpits are a steam bath for the city's germ gangsters, the liver is a skid-row slum full of bums, the bowels are the red-light district, the stomach the airport.  It's all grandly realized with a sweep even some live-action films might be pressed to top, and it's as impressive in its way as the cyberthespians of this summer's Final Fantasy (another big-budget animated film that did not fly with moviegoers).  The characters themselves are just as entertaining, thanks to bouncy design and the effective voice work of Shatner, Rock, and especially Pierce and Fishburne.  Thrax in particular is a droll and bloodthirsty villain, and as he stalks through Frank's nether regions, scratching up a fever with his razor talons, the threat to poor pathetic Frank seems surprisingly urgent.The film's live action segments are directed by Peter and Bobby Farrelly, and while I have found most of their recent work as funny as a crutch, here they score some big laughs.  Murray's dissipation is marvelous, and a scene in which he horrifies his daughter's teacher (Molly Shannon) with a volcanic forehead zit is among the most gruesomely funny I've seen in a while.Marc Hyman's script is witty and clever, and the film is peppered with so many throwaway gags that it's really worth seeing twice to pick up all the jokes you missed (my favorite  a sign on the wall of an inner-Frank diner reading No Cilia, No Cytoplasm, No Service).  It spanks along at a nice brisk pace, helped immensely by a catchy soundtrack of pop and rap tunes.I had a great time at Osmosis Jones, and it's really a mystery to me why more audiences didn't go for it.  Maybe the bodily humor was too clever and not gross enough for kids.  Maybe the poster (which featured no actors) didn't help.  Maybe people can only stomach one animated film per summer, and they had already seen Shrek.  Don't let the film's box office failure keep you away, though.  Check it out at the cheap theatres, or at the very least see it on video.  I bet you'll be surprised how much you enjoy yourself.

Part live action, part animation, it's a spin on buddy pictures that takes place in zookeeper Bill Murray's body, where a rogue virus (the voice of Laurence Fishburne) plots to kill Murray while a disgraced police cell (no pun intended) voiced by Chris Rock teams with a cold pill (the voice of David Hyde Pierce) to defeat him. The film has no great aspirations, preferring to draw on the `Lethal Weapon' series and `Toy Story' for its inspiration and the animation, while compelling, is reminiscent of old, one-dimensional Hanna-Barbera cartoons, specifically `The Jetsons'. The gags are naturally about bodily functions and there's lots of playfulness with names and concepts. But the audience these gags are aimed at--the pre-teen crowd--will find most of them going over their heads. "},{"Title":"More Frank!

Fishburne dips an octave or two below the tones of his Matrix alter ego and delivers real power as the virus out to destroy the city of Frank (Bill Murray), who is to hygiene and nutrition what Gary Condit is to truth and justice.A cold capsule named Drix (David Hyde Pierce) and Frank's Mayor Phlegmming (William Shatner) likewise add to a cast that fairly clicks with hammish appeal, and the animation is top drawer, particularly when Thrax happens upon Frank's subconscious.

The instructional value seeps out of this comedy leaving a fast-moving parody highlighting the voices of Chris Rock (Osmosis), David Hyde-Pierce (Drix) and Laurence Fishburne (Thrax). This is no Fantastic Voyage meets the Magic School Bus but there's Saturday Morning cartoon series written all over it. In live action, Bill Murray is an underemployed zoo worker who's careless about his ingestion. The 10-second rule doesn't serve him well considering he was sharing a hard-boiled egg with a chimp even before it hit the ground. His daughter's admonitions serve little purpose since he's determined to forage mindlessly.   Every action has a reaction and the cartoons microbial have their hands full. Osmosis is a white blood cell working on the immunity force to keep... alive. When an anthrax virus is introduced through the egg, the plot unfolds as the sinister and seedy join forces to destroy Mayor Phlegmming's (William Shatner) town. And to medicate this virus, ... takes a timed-release cold capsule bringing Drix (David Hyde-Pierce) to the rescue. The live characters play well against the cartoon characters, but if there was a competition, the 'toons take it. Bill Murray's comment that his zoo job. allows me to hang out with a better class of animals, sadly rings true. Molly Shannon (Mrs. Boyd) doesn't transition well to the big screen and Chris Elliott hasn't gone past his overly literal, hapless schmoe role.The animation, sound track and script keep the show moving. Puns are seeping from every pore. But what can you do when you're spit up creek w/o a paddle? Maybe for entertainment lets go to the Kidney to see the Stones....Had enough?

This is not a bad idea, but it was poorly executed. The Farrellys can do much better than this.I think the problem here is that the Farrellys are used to doing crude, sexual humor. In this animated PG-rated movie (obviously trying to appeal to kids because they got it down from a PG-13 rating), the Farrellys can't get away with it. So they try doing some gross stuff while keeping the mood PG-rated. The result is disastrous. Without sexual humor the Farrellys bomb, and this movie is not funny at all.They pull off a few good sight gags here. It's amusing to see what the body looks like under the Farrelly imagination (such as, making a zit into a sleazy nightclub). This is slightly amusing, but it never made me laugh out loud. The dialogue was even worse.Chris Rock is terrible here. His usual humor, of course, is out of place in a kiddie movie, but his usual pace is also slowed down. He has absolutely no good jokes in this movie. The other animated figures are very cliche - you've got the trusty sidekick, the corrupt politician, the damsel-in-distress. Since when have the Farrelys used such cliches? None of the jokes by the animation cells (pun intended) are good.But if you think the animation scenes sound mediocre at best, wait till you see the live action. Bill Murray's comic talent is completely wasted, as is Chris Elliott's. I completely agree with the only other person that gave this a bad review - you just don't care if Bill Murray dies, since he's a piggish jerk in the movie. I'll say one thing though - whoever that girl is who played Shane, she does a good job acting for someone so young. It's her first movie, and she pulled off her role quite nicely.However, her part doesn't save this movie. All the jokes fall flat. No one in the theater was laughing at all. To make matters worse, this film has a moral, and one that no one wants to hear - eat right and exercise or you'll die. Who likes being told that they're fat?The funniest thing about this movie?

First we have Frank, played by Bill Murray, who is a slob. His daughter Shane has had enough of his ways. Frank's slobbish ways allow him to swallow food with a nasty virus named Thrax. Moving to the animated story line, Osmosis Jones (voiced by Chris Rock) is a white-blood-cell that discovers the virus and must stop him from killing Frank, and all the people (cells) in Frank's body.I found myself interested in each story line, and the transfers between live action and animation kept the movie exciting.

When Oz sees a villainous germ in the stomach, he immediately hits the PUKE button- creating the ultimate panic button scene. Chris Rock, who made his career playing comic cops, here gets the ultimate straight man in David Hyde Pierce (Frasier's Niles) who somewhow manages to play a superhero cold pill convincingly. The two work well together; I'd like to see them both on Frasier sometime. But the best thing about this film is Fishburne, whose brilliantly designed Thrax (Looking like a cross between Ice-T and the Red Skull from Fantastic Four) is complimented by his unusually campy performance. In one of the film's wittier allusions, Thrax causes damage with a literal fever spike, an extended, sharpened digit that heats up whatever he touches.The problem with this film is the live action sequences, which are dull and uninvolving. Bill Murray, one of the world's greatest physical comedians, is forced to spend much of the film moaning on his back, so one would expect him to rely on his snarky sarcasm for laughs. Unfortunately he isn't allowed to. Instead the humour is derived from grossing the audience out as much as possible, which worked in the Farrelley Brothers' previous films as long as the actors were allowed to play along, but here they all wear serious faces. I think this film would have done better as a fully animated film, perhaps even as a weekly show. Instead it is merely average, which is a shame.

As the other commenters point out, Chris Rock, Laurence Fishburne, and David Hyde Pierce are all fantastic in their cartoon roles, each making the most of lines that are for the most part delicious already.  This is definitely a movie to see more than once; there's so much good stuff going on in the background that you can never catch it all in one go.But I found two things particularly charming about this movie that haven't been mentioned much by other commenters.First is the absolutely and literally stunning performance by William Shatner.  Even if you know going into the movie that he provides the voice for Mayor Phlegmming, you may not be able to believe it when you hear it. I'm no Shatner-basher; I like Captain Kirk and I think Shatner himself is a genuine cultural icon . . . but when I saw his recent attempt at comedy (Miss Congeniality), I thought, Geez, he just looks uncomfortable. Worse than not funny.  I felt he seemed lost.BUT in Osmosis Jones . . . well, as I said, you might not even believe it is him!  His voiceover work outshines all the other actors.  Sure, Rock and Pierce are great, but they're just doing another take on their on-screen personae, the same way Robin Williams just did his own schtick as the Genie in Aladdin.  Fishburne's role requires more acting, and he's a fine menace.  But Shatner's Mayor is a masterpiece of subtlety and vocal shading -- and he's in a role that's the opposite of every other part he's known for!  Self-centered, deceitful, short-sighted, and greedy.  Yet Shatner uses imaginative nuances and perfect emphasis and timing as if he'd been playing this part all his life.  Who knew he had it in him?  Mr. Shatner, I apologize for any unkind thoughts I may have had about Miss C., and implore you to take another cartoon role.The second extraordinary thing I liked about the movie was that it was filmed in my elementary school.

The audience I saw it with was largely quiet and seemed as uninvolved in it as I was.  About the only thing going for it is the vocal talent (Rock, Fishburne, Pierce, Shatner) but even that ended up being disappointing.  The concept just doesn't work.  There's a major disconnect between the live action sequences with Frank (Bill Murray) in the real world (which make up perhaps 1/3 of the movie) and theanimated sequences of what's going on inside his body.  For me, this very cartoony anthropomorphic world of his internal organisms (the animation design reminds me of the Simpsons a little bit) just cannot possibly exist at all in the real world...yet we are supposed to believe that Frank's white blood cells look like Smurf/Bart Simpson hybrids and sound like Chris Rock...it was just impossible for me to suspend my disbelief as the film cuts back and forth between these two completely different universes. That said, I guess the filmmakers do what they can with it, the way they visualize the city of Frank (the inhabitants refer to his brain as Cerebellum Hall, the armpits are where all of the evil bacteria and viruses hang out and veins are shown as busy highways) is somewhat clever but, again, entirely too fantastic to exist in the real world.  And then when these wholly disparate worlds collide, andthe animated micro-organisms are literally travelling from one person to another AND THEN BACK AGAIN via phlegm and tears in the real world...well, that's when the impossible becomesTOTALLY LUDICROUS.And it doesn't help that all of the live-action actors (notably Murray, Molly Shannon and Chris Elliott) appear to just be collecting paychecks.  Murray has achieved a new low here...I enjoyed his recent turns in `Rushmore' and `Charlie's Angels' but this is just plain embarrassing for him.  The Farrelly brothers just must've told him to be as disgusting and slovenly as possible, which is fine I guess but that's all he has to do in this and what a waste of his talent.  And the result is we just don't care about his character...he's repugnant and an idiot.  So what if the Thrax (the virus) causes him to die?  The audience feels no sympathy towards Murray and that is the fatal flaw of the film.And really, I expected more of Rock...there are a couple of scenes where it looks like he was able to improvise and do his thing but for the most part the filmmakers keep him on a pretty short leash and stick to the script, and I really think that an opportunity may have been missed there.  Used properly, I think Rock could do great voice-overs for animated films.Oh yeah, one more thing...why can't a comedic film come out without some dumb film parody in it?  You've seen the action in the Matrix parodied a million times already...well add another attempt (very feeble at that) to the list.  It's really getting annoying, and pedestrian animated films like this one really have no new insights to add as far as that parody goes. That's what we have Simpsons and South Park for.One final note...I had this weird feeling when I walked out of the theater...as if the film just didn't work, and I knew the movie reminded me of another, but I couldn't remember what at first.  Then it came to me...remember `The Last Action Hero'?  That film left me with that same feeling, because Arnold Schwarzenneggar plays the role of a movie character that comes to life in the real world.  It was just totally impossible to believe and renders the film - no matter how well it's done and how well everything else is conceived - toothless.  And Osmosis Jones falls flat for the same reason.  Audiences can suspend their disbelief...but only to a certain point.

The exterior scenes with Bill Murray and Chris Elliot are a bit weak with a standard single father raising a precocious daughter storyline that is only marginally enhanced by the utter vulgarity of the characters. Unfortunately, if you're old enough to get the in-humor of the inner universe scenes, such as finding a lawyer in the hemroid area, you're likely going to be utterly revolted by the gross out scenes, something thirteen year old boys probably will find hilarious -- but not many others. The movie is somewhat engaging, likely due to the voice characterizations--standouts are David Hyde-Price as the by the books cold capsule, and William Shatner as the slimy Mayor. If you like Chris Rock, you'll probably like his character. I dislike his humor but taking out the vulgar language makes him at least reasonably funny. Laurence Fishburne is nicely menacing as Thrax, presumably some mutant strain of Anthrax. This won't win any awards for directing or editing, or anything technical, the animation is mediocre, they did far better things back in the forties. The real world acting is also thoroughly mediocre, somebody please put Molly Shannon back from wherever she came from, she only has a few scenes and is remarkably unfunny to the point of irritation. So there it is A basically average movie enhanced by the really clever rendering of a been done Hollywood plot line, but sadly dragged down by mindlessly immature gross out scenes. One thing seems certain, this is a boys movie, the fairer sex might want to keep away unless the idea of picking up an egg from the ground after it's been in a chimp's mouth and eating it, with the invocation of the ten second rule, sounds funny to you.

She stormed out of the theater before the credits even began rolling because she hated the live action so much. Somehow it all became my fault. Fortunately she dumped me recently, so her opinion on this film means squat to me now. But I would have to stand, as a critic, on the ground that the animated sequences of the film did not flow smoothly into the gross live action scenes. It's almost as if you are getting top-notch Don Bluth post-Titan A.E. animation, then you have to cinch up your stomach and settle into barf-and-zit-popping comedy served up Farrely Brothers' style. It just didn't mix well at all. Everything else was fantastic. The cast, the animation, the story, the soundtrack, the back-story, the overt sub-plots, everything. The only real problem was that the two parts of the story didn't blend well. It would have been better if either Matt Groening or Mike Judge had directed the animated story so that it would be more adult oriented humor, or if Ivan Reitman or someone of his ilk had directed the live action bits so that it would have been more family oriented humor. Because trying to do both in the same film doesn't work.

Gem","Date":"5 June 2013","Score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Animation, Action, Adventure","Review":" This is one of those rare gems that gets better and better with each viewing. There are so many in-jokes and subtleties packed into it, that it is impossible to get them all with just one viewing. Each repeat viewing evokes a new and unexpected chuckle or grin. Best viewed on DVD so you can pause and review what you just thought you saw. (Does that sentence make sense?) Although the Live Action parts are rough around the edges. Bill Murray is genius, as always, and the animation scenes are obviously a work of love. The one drawback is Chris Elliot, who, no matter what project he is in, brings the whole production to a crashing bore, due to his complete unlike-ability as an actor and a person.Those who get this film get it, those who don't, chances are - never will.

The animated world takes place inside Frank Detorre's (Bill Murray's) body, where white blood cells behave like police officers and viruses behave like criminals, living in Frank's body as if it were a city. The City of Frank is run by an irresponsible mayor who has lead to a huge decline in the slovenly Frank's health. Frank ingests an extremely lethal virus named Thrax, and it's up to blacklisted cop Osmosis Jones and cold pill Drixenol to stop him before it's too late. Even in animated form, some of the humor is a little hard to stomach (no pun intended), though not as much as the live action parts. It's interesting that other movies that take place inside the human body like Fantastic Voyage or Innerspace are actually live action in their entirety, but are definitely less grotesque. The animation is done well, it's energetic and visually appealing. It's fun to see how exactly different sections of the body translate into the concept of it being a city, the zit, the nose, and the brain being the most imaginative areas.Thrax is a cool villain, and he actually kills quite a few characters in various gruesome and brutal ways on screen, which isn't something you'll usually see in a film primarily targeted at younger viewers. Osmosis Jones and Drix make for good protagonists, each having their own troubles they come to terms with. Their relationship is a bit stereotypical buddy cop movie style at times, but there's definitely some good stuff regarding Ozzie's past mistakes and Drix's fears of being ultimately useless.The live action side of things isn't as good as the animation, but it still has its moments. I'm a big fan of Bill Murray, and though he's still funny at times in this, it's definitely not his best work. The live action gross out humor is never outright disgusting, but things like the throbbing zit popping on a woman's lip are still pretty gross.Some unappreciated crude humor aside, I do recommend the film.

I liked that it sort of explained what your body was made of but in a CG funny way. I thought that the way that it was trying to get rid of the virus or *red death* it was very well done. It was good funny, informing, and entertaining. There were some gross parts like when Franks zit popped and when Frank puked all over the teacher. But it was still funny. I wouldn't recommend it to kids under 8 because of some really gross parts and there are some parts that are a little scary because of the red death kills some of the germs. Also there is some adult language and content. But other than that a very well done movie.9/10 "},{"Title":"quite a body of work","Date":"3 May 2006","Score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Animation, Action, Adventure","Review":" This could only come from the Farrelly brothers! When zoo-keeper Frank Detomello (Bill Murray) accidentally swallows a germ named Thrax (Laurence Fishburne) that starts causing trouble in the city that is Frank's body, cop Osmosis Jones (Chris Rock) sets about trying to find the trouble.Of course, since this is from the guys who gave us Dumb & Dumber and There's Something About Mary, you know that the plot is an excuse for a series of gross occurrences. And there certainly are some here (just think of what all one can do with the human body). It's hard to say what's my favorite scene. All that I can tell you is that this is not a movie for the fainthearted. Pretty cool.

I remember going into an almost empty theater when I saw this movie. It is really a lot better than it looked. I'm guessing most people were just expecting a Disney type of movie.This is a great movie for kids, not because it is part cartoon, but also because it has plenty of great science facts in it. This is a fun way for kids to learn what would probably bore them to death in a class room.This is part animation, and live action. The best scenes are the scenes that take place inside of Frank, because the live action scenes don't have much life to them. Some of the live action scenes can be quite gross as well, with the ingrown toenails, the vomiting, and the popping pimples.The animation is great. Chris Rock is great at providing a voice for a white blood cell, and one of my favorite actors, Lawrence Fishburne(Yes, that's Morpheus from The Matrix) is the voice of a disease. He makes a very cool, convincing, and terrifying villain.This is a good movie. Despite it's poor box office success, it is shown on Cartoon Network, it is shown in science classes a lot, and it has a cartoon series based upon it(it's not a very good series though). Watch this movie, it's great, and let your kids watch this movie too. I'm sure they will love it.

It would have been surprising had it been a smash hit, but it still deserved better than the reception it got.The movie's at its best when the action stays inside the City (i.e. body) of Frank, the nauseatingly unhealthy zookeeper played by Bill Murray; the layout and characters are fun, especially the running-for-reelection Mayor of Frank and cold pill Drix, and the little details dotted throughout (my favourite the computer screen displaying Frank Online in lieu of America Online) make it seem like a living, breathing world. Though I'd like to know how they managed to get hold of Sophie Ellis Bextor records for their club (really, reall small discs?). The inner workings of Frank and the plotline of a vicious germ who's out to set a new record by killing Frank in 48 hours are more compelling than the live-action scenes, which for the most part just get in the way of the real meat of Marc Hyman's screenplay when they aren't being more gross than they have to be. (Then again, the TV series Ozzy & Drix - and why did Warner Bros. make a TV series out of this anyway, given the film's lack of success? What with Evolution, Godzilla and this, I wish studios would wait until something's actually a real hit before launching the spinoff machine - lost the sense of different worlds that this one has, because the scenes inside Hector the boy who Osmosis and Drix were transferred to in the first episode and out were entirely animated.)Osmosis himself is less entertaining than most of the other characters, but it's colourful and fast-paced, and doesn't get drippy enough for it to hurt. Warner Bros. has had its shield on some utterly horrid cartoons, but this definitely counts as one of their better efforts. If only the stuff outside the body was as wide-ranging...

Unlike Finding Nemo, where (with a bit of suspension of disbelief) attention to detail was staggering and the science was as good as the context would allow, Osmosis Jones was utter nonsense; don't kid yourself about the science.

Middle-school science teachers often leave this movie in lieu of a lesson plan. This is unfortunate because the movie teaches nothing and is also not entertaining.As best I can tell, the producers saw one of those Science is COOL! posters -- feeble propaganda that fools nobody and embarrasses those who do like science -- and said, let's make a movie of it! They decked it out with a star-filled cast and plenty of fart/poop/bodily fluid jokes. It never adds up to any more than the poster. But you can look away from a poster. This just keeps going, and going, and going. (And normally I have to show it to FIVE CLASSES).The problem is that no age group will get anything from this movie. It is not engaging or funny enough for teens and adults, and has enough gross jokes to alienate many of the latter. Elementary-school kids might like the animation and goofy/stereotypical story.There is no scientific lesson here. The only lesson is, Eat healthy and exercise.
