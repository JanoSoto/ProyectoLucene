Young lovers are separated by war; bad things happen to both. We've seen it many times before.Nonetheless, we haven't seen it filmed this well, with bold shots that take liberties to emphasize separation, or destruction, or hopelessness. All the more remarkable coming from the Soviet Union, and reason to conclude that Tarkovsky is not the last word in modern-era Soviet cinema.I was reading Chekhov's Three Sisters the other day, and chanced upon what may be the meaning of the title of this film. In Act 2, Masha objects to the notion that we must live our lives without meaning or understandingMASHA Surely mankind must believe in something, or at least seek for the truth, otherwise life is just emptiness, emptiness. To live and not to know why the cranes are flying, why children are born, why there are stars in the sky. Either you must know why it is you live, or everything is trivial - mere pointless nonsense.Likewise, Veronika has a hard time believing that the war, and her and others' sufferings, have been pointless. Better to assign a meaning, to live as if one's life is significant, and not to give in to despair. It is perhaps this thinking that prompts her to her final act in the film.BTW as a minor correction to one other comment here--there may be a pattern of V's in the film, though I hadn't noticed them myself. But the first letter of Veronika's name is not a further instance of this; in the Cyrillic alphabet, her name begins with a letter which looks like an English B.

This film features a Red Army that is NOT victorious, in fact they are encircled, in a retreat mode, with many people dying, including the hero, in a film set after 06-02-41, the German invasion of Russia when Germany introduced the Barbarossa Plan, a blitzkrieg invasion intended to bring about a quick victory and the ultimate enslavement of the Slavs, and very nearly succeeded, actually getting within 20 miles of Moscow in what was a Red Army wipe out, a devastation of human losses, 15 to 20 million Russians died, or 20% of the entire population.  Historically, this was a moment of great trauma and suffering, a psychological shock to the Russian people, but the Red Army held and prolonged the war 4 more years until they were ultimately victorious.  During the war, Stalin used the war genre in films for obvious morale boosting, introducing female heroines who were ultra-patriotic and strong and idealistic, suggesting that if females could be so successful and patriotic, then Russia could expect at least as much from their soldiers. Stalin eliminated the mass hero of the proletariat and replaced it with an individual, bold leader who was successful at killing many of the enemy, an obvious reference to Stalin himself, who was always portrayed in film as a bold, wise and victorious leader.  But Kalatozov changed this depiction, as THE CRANES ARE FLYING was made after Stalin's death, causing a political thaw and creating a worldwide sensation, winning the Cannes Film Festival Palm D'Or, as well as the Best Director and Best Actress (Tatyana Samoilova), reawakening the West to Soviet Cinema for the first time since Eisenstein's IVAN THE TERRIBLE in the 40's.  This film featured brilliant, breathtaking, and extremely mobile camera work from his extraordinary cinematographer Sergei Uresevsky, using spectacular crane and tracking shots, images of wartime, battlefields, Moscow and crowded streets that are extremely vivid and real.  Another brilliant scene features the lead heroine, Veronica, who hasn't heard from her lover, Boris, in the 4 years at war, so he is presumed dead, but she continues to love him, expressed in a scene where she runs towards a bridge with a train following behind her, a moment when the viewer was wondering if she might throw herself in front of that train, instead she saves a 3 yr old boy named Boris who was about to be hit by a car. Another scene captures the death of Boris on the battlefield, who dies a senseless death, and his thoughts spin and whirl in a beautiful montage of trees, sky, leaves, all spinning in a kaleidoscope of his own thoughts and dreams, including an imaginary wedding with Veronica.  This film features the famous line, You can dream when the war is over.  In the final sequence, when the war is over, the soldiers are returning in a mass scene on the streets, Veronica learns Boris died, all are happy and excited with the soldier's return, but Veronica is in despair, passing out flowers to soldiers and strangers on the street in an extreme gesture of generosity and selflessness revealing  cranes white and gray floating in the sky.  The film was released in 1957 in Russia, and according to some reviews, the silence in the theater was profound, the wall between art and living life had fallen...and tears unlocked the doors.

Although the film is about Russian characters in WWII, don't expect to see any Nazis, cannons, blood, gore, etc. It's not a film about people who cause a war or who fight a war. It's a film about ordinary people who war happens to and the choices they make in dealing with it.Acting, cinematography, writing all perfect 10s here. You'll certainly appreciate it if you're Russian like me, but even if not, you'll probably love it. If you speak no Russian, look for the RUSCICO (Russian Cinema Council) DVD version. It's got subtitles in about 14 different languages, but the English dubbing on this one I'd say is just as good. It's of course not as good as the original Russian track (some stuff is lost in translation), but just as good as the English subtitles.

For the record, this movie was made in 1957 in Russia, but the technique used here is probably something that we've seen much later in the western world...about 20 years later. The level of emotions through the film varies quite a lot happiness -love-war- despair-joy, but in the end you remain with something quite unique the joy of seeing one masterpiece of filmmaking. The young directors from our time should study more this kind of movies and maybe they will be able to create something similar..even though I think movies like this are very hard to come by... If you've seen I am Cuba , then this movie would appeal to you very much,  but if not, be prepared for a unique experience. The Russian directors have something in common very small budgets, great actors, and a joy of creating art...and yes, they are able to create more masterpieces than all the western world together. I am not a big fan of Russia, actually I hate everything that's communist, but the film making in that part of the world, manages to create such feelings that are hard to describe.Enjoy it.

It is sublime and beautifully filmed. Some scenes feel like there were made way ahead of their time. Sergei Urusevsky's camera work and creative discoveries were included in the text books and widely imitated. The film tells the moving and timeless story of love destroyed by merciless war but eternally alive in the memory of a young woman. It is also the film about loyalty, memories, ability to live on when it seems there is nothing to live for; it is about forgiveness, and about hope. The film received (absolutely deservingly) the Grand Prix at Cannes Film Festival and Tatiana Samoilova was chosen as a recipient of a special award at Cannes for playing Veronika, the young girl happily in love with the best man in the world in the beginning of the movie. After separation with her beloved who went to the front, the loss of her family in the bomb ride, and the marriage to the man she never loved and only wished he never existed, she turned to the shadow of herself, she became dead inside. Her long journey to redemption, to finally accepting death of her beloved and to learning how to live with it, is a fascinating and heartbreaking one and it simply won't leave any viewer indifferent.For me, the movie is very personal and dear because I was born and grew up in the city where its characters lived and were so happy in the beginning. I walked the same streets, squares, and bridges over the Moskva River. Every family in the former Soviet Union had lost at least one but often more than one family member to a combat or to the concentration camp or to the ghetto or to hunger, cold, and illnesses during WWII and my family is not exception. My mother and grandmother knew the horrors of war and never healing pain of losses not just from the movies and the books. Cranes are Flying speaks to me clearly and honestly and touches me very deeply. It is a masterpiece of movie making but it is a part of my life - my background, my memory, and my past.

She is the focal point of a bittersweet war romance against the background of World War II in Moscow.The film is almost poetic in its gorgeous B&W cinematography which was the main reason for watching the film in the first place, since I had never heard of it and decided to give it a try when it aired on TCM.It's a very moving love story about a girl's deep love for a man who is suddenly swept away by his role as a soldier drafted in wartime Russia. She's unable to forget the memory of her romantic attachment to him, but inexplicably marries someone else who has forced himself on her, a pianist who soon realizes that she still loves the soldier she hopes to hear from. Their marriage is a troubled one because she can't let go of her remembrance of a happier time with her soldier sweetheart.By the end of the story, she accepts the idea that he's never going to return and is able to face reality and cope with the situation. There's a very poignant final scene at a train station where arriving soldiers are greeting their loved ones and the tearful girl shares the joy of the returning soldiers by giving some flowers from her bouquet to the joyous families.The stylish and striking camera-work is what carries the film, as well as the honestly played story.Tastefully done, but perhaps the English subtitles didn't tell the whole tale because some of the plot elements seemed a bit blurred to me as if they had been glossed over.Summing up Easy to see why it won awards at the Cannes Film Festival.

Soviet films are known for their overzealous propagandist approach but, thankfully, this one's free of such emphasis - with the interest firmly on the central tragic romance between a promising artist and a vivacious girl, doomed by the outbreak of war for which he gladly volunteers but from which he'll never return. The girl (a remarkable performance from Tatyana Samojlova) is also loved by the young man's cousin and, when she doesn't receive word from her boyfriend, gives in to the latter and marries him. He, however, is an aspiring concert pianist bitter about the war having curtailed his chances for success and, knowing too that the girl's still devoted to the soldier, begins to neglect her. Finally, word reaches the girl of her loved one's death but, by the end of the film, she has learnt to accept this as a sacrifice to their native country and is content to live with her memories of him.The film features some truly amazing camera-work which makes extremely judicious use of the screen space and, by frequently adopting tracking, tilted and high or low angle shots, renders great power to the unfolding emotional drama. Individual sequences are equally impressive - two in particular the stunning scene, frenetically edited and sped-up to boot, in which the girl saves an abandoned boy from being trampled by a truck; and the young man's premature demise in an unfortunate incident at the front, undoubtedly one of the best of its kind I've ever watched (with the sun moving away from him, symbolizing the life that's seeping out of his body, as he imagines the wedding day he'll never have!). Also notable, however, is the scene where the girl goes to look for her parents in her home that's been hopelessly devastated during an air raid; as is her final violent capitulation to the concert pianist - which she tries to resist by repeatedly slapping him in the face - taking place during a later air raid and making particularly effective use of a set of billowing curtains!Disappointingly, the R1 DVD of this outstanding film is a bare-bones affair (the RusCiCo edition features a few supplements but, being an export, tends to be heavily overpriced and hard to track down to boot!); Criterion released it in conjunction with another war-themed Russian classic, BALLAD OF A SOLDIER (1959) - which my pal at the local DVD rental outlet has told me is forthcoming... The only other film I've watched from this director is the Arctic epic THE RED TENT (1969; albeit via the much-shorter U.S.-release version!), a star-studded international production based on true events; given the unmistakable artistic quality of THE CRANES ARE FLYING, I regret missing out now on his famous documentary I AM CUBA (1964) a number of times when I was in Hollywood late last year apart from receiving a one-week theatrical run, it was shown more than once on TV accompanied by a feature-length Making Of!!

Superb acting, particularly by Samoilova and Vasili Merkuryev (as Boris' uncle) that is made all the more poignant by sheer understatement.

I loved the camera work in I am Cuba, but I felt that the story was too rigid, too much of a propaganda piece, too much of an advertisement for my taste. The characters weren't real enough, not fully developed. It felt as if I were watching types of people rather than actual people. In The Cranes are Flying, which Kalatozov made prior to I am Cuba, I didn't find the same problem. The story is thoroughly engaging, and I felt a whole range of emotions. The lead character, specifically is so real, I think she will haunt my dreams. She is played by Tatyana Samojlova who deserves special acclaim. She is dazzling. Her sweet charm reminded me of Audrey Hepburn, and yet Samojlova's acting seems to have a broader range. Hers is more realistic in a way that feels ahead of its time in 1957. Her wild despair is in a league with the best emoter actresses, such as Natalie Wood, Isabelle Adjani, Juliette Binoche. I must mention, also, that the cinematography is so crisp, it seems to be 4 decades ahead of its time. As far as composition and movement of the camera, I'd say it has strains of several styles, including German Expressionism of the 20's and 30's, and the stormy noir melodramas of the '40s, like Out of the Past (1947). This is a romantic, dramatic movie that looks long and hard at the repercussions of war, and yes, it does have a message and it certainly hammers it home, but still I think it stays more clearly in the realm of universal themes, rather than falling into the propagandist ditch.In summary, I don't think I have ever seen better acting, better camera work, better editing, or better direction in any movie made previous to it. There were some scenes made with such planning and precision that I had to press PAUSE just to catch my breath. Lovers of movie history, enjoy!

From the screenplay by Viktor Rozov, based on his own play, Kalatozov shows us a vision of the heroism of war and the suffering by those left at home. Inundated with countless war movies showing us the frontlines and the carnage, the topic itself becomes tedious and avoidable. However, this Russian gem shows how the tale of hardship can be told in a different way; by telling us, straight from a soldier's mouth how war is hated by all, that they hope those who died did so for a cause that will allow for peace and the end of fighting, we see a new vision of WWII. We have young men volunteering to wage war for peace, to keep their families and loved ones safe at home rather than draftees fighting a battle they don't believe in. With so much hatred towards our current situation in the Middle East, and how people are dying for no reason, against their will, it's nice to see a film that shows just how selfless and heroic these soldiers are, as well as those awaiting their return.Communist Russia shows how involved all were in the war. While Boris may have volunteered to go to the frontlines, his father is head doctor of a hospital aiding in the mending of soldiers injured and his sister is helping him there as well as his girl Veronika, doing all she can to keep her mind off the fact that no letter has arrived from her love. An entire city comes out to send the boys off in celebration. Even the factory that Boris and his friend Stepan work for send representatives over with gifts of gratitude. Whether this is all a glorified look into Russia at the outset of WWII or not, I don't know. There are no protests or badmouthing of these boys risking their lives for a country, it is all praise and thanks. Some in America could learn a lesson from this because whether you agree with the war at hand or not, protesting and wreaking havoc in its name only sullies what these men and women are sacrificing each and everyday.The acting is top-notch throughout, but some deserve singling out. I really enjoyed Antonina Bogdanova in a small role as Boris' grandmother. She is the one family member he can trust and her sadness at his leaving is very evident on her face and through her body language. Vasili Merkuryev, as the patriarch Fyodor Ivanovich, brings what is perhaps the best performance. As spoken at the end, about fathers needing to choke back hidden tears, Merkuryev epitomizes those sentiments. He puts on a tough exterior, especially cracking jokes and riding his son hard when he finds out about his volunteering just hours before he must leave. But when Boris exits to go to the assembly station we see the true pain of the man, seated in sorrow at the table. He loves his son dearly and although he may not be able to show it to him, his actions throughout the film express it to the audience. Aleksey Batalov is effective as Boris, a happy-go-lucky young man, and idealist, doing what he believes is right, and Aleksandr Shvorin is good as the villainous Mark, staying home due to his talented piano skills, or maybe just to steal his cousin's love. That love, played by Tatyana Samojlova, really draws the audience in to her grief, dejection, and slim glimmer of hope. The true star of the film, she must go through many emotions on a journey where she does lose her way, needing to steer back on course, hoping that she did so soon enough for Boris' return.Besides the realism to the story, as well as being unafraid to use tragedy to get the theme across, I also loved the visual style of the film. Sergei Urusevsky's cinematography is amazing, especially when considering the movie was shot in fullscreen. It is one thing to create stunning compositions in a widescreen panorama; it is completely different to do so in a square frame. Right from the beginning we get a beautiful static shot of a winding walkway along water, a bridge in the background at the top, as our two lovers skip their way up the screen and into the distance. There are multiple instances of the camera being behind barriers yet still allowing for the action to be seen, creating unique spatial depth and interest at all times. Sharp angles are utilized, as well as careful blocking to allow for overhead shots and exaggerated juxtapositions of characters in frame together.The real feats, however, are those instances of the long shot. Used well towards the end to follow Veronika through the mass of returning soldiers, it is magnificent earlier on as she roams through those saying goodbye to their loved ones while she searches for Boris, her own farewell needing to be said. The planning for this shot must have been extensive because while she weaves in and out of people, the camera focuses on couples kisses, people yelling to one another, and more, all purposely in frame at specific moments while the camera moves through. Everyone needed to hit his mark precisely and it leads to a brilliant piece of cinema. It's just one part of an overall masterpiece of tone and style; The Cranes are Flying shows how successful placement and mise en scène can be in showing the audience what it needs in as simple a way as possible. Composition and professionalism from the actors and crew can work wonders, adding something that huge setpieces and special effects can never do.

In the early years of the 1950s, film production came close to a complete standstill a mere nine feature-films were released in 1951, and the work of all filmmakers was closely monitored, and often censored, by the government. Following the death of Joseph Stalin in 1953, filmmakers were given greater artistic freedom with their pictures, though many remained reluctant to challenge the heroic, optimistic and propagandistic stance towards warfare that had been prevalent in previous years. It wasn't until 1957 that director Mikhail Kalatozov and writer Viktor Rozov became bold enough to produce what is widely-considered the first post-Stalin Soviet masterpiece, 'Letyat zhuravli / The Cranes are Flying,' one of the finest depictions of war I've seen from any country or time period. Not only was the film lauded for its artistic brilliance in the Soviet Union, but international recognition was soon to follow, and Kalatozov's film was honoured with the Palm d'Or at the 1958 Cannes Film Festival.'The Cranes are Flying' is both an invigorating visual feast and an audacious, humanistic portrayal of war. Unlike many Soviet war-themed films of the time, it was less constrained by the archetypal figure of the traditional war-time hero, and more concerned with the futility, brutality and, indeed, the inevitability of conflict. Love, as a cinematic concept, is too-often idealised as a notion that somehow conquers all and endures endless hardship, and yet the reality is substantially less romantic. In the film, two lovers, Veronika (Tatyana Samojlova) and Boris (Aleksey Batalov), separated by the advent of the WWII widely known in the Soviet Union as the Great Patriotic War, 1941-1945, pledge to marry after the war, but tragedy denies the couple their wish. Driven to betrayal by the unending torment and uncertainty of waiting, Veronika agrees to wed Boris' cousin, Mark (Aleksandr Shvorin), a handsome but unworthy youth. The film may conclude with the proud victory of the Soviets, and a patriotic flag-waving parade, but the optimism of this sequence is overwhelmingly eclipsed by the bittersweet tragedy of our young female protagonist, who wanders soullessly through the celebrating crowds.Perhaps the most remarkable feature of 'The Cranes are Flying' is Sergei Urusevsky's inspired and dynamic hand-held cinematography, which realistically and dizzily captures the chaos and confusion of war, not necessarily in the hail of gunfire and the cries of dying comrades in fact, only one of the film's sequences joins Boris on the Eastern Front, but from the perspective of the family and friends who are left behind. In one particularly impressive, oft-cited long shot, the camera follows Veronika as she frantically searches for Boris in a crowd of departing recruits and their families. The hand-held camera smoothly follows the girl off a bus, jostles through the crowd alongside her - capturing momentary snippets of loved ones saying farewell to their sons and husbands - before unexpectedly craning above the crowd as Veronika disappears into the dust of a passing squadron of army tanks, a breathtaking movement that offers scope and urgency to the dramatic episode. Urusevsky first acquired his filming experience as a military cameraman during the war, and obviously fell in love with the storytelling possibilities of hand-held photography The camera, he once declared, can express what the actor is unable to portray his inner sensations. The cameraman must act with the actors. "},{"Title":"five thumbs up!

I stumbled across this movie by accident (channel surfing), and couldn't surf away. This is a truly incredible movie, worthy of all the praise the critics and those on this site have heaped on it. The actors are terrific. Tatiana is beautiful and innocent. Her fiancé Boris is sweet and patriotic. You couldn't help but feel Boris' father's exasperation and sorrow as he upbraids his son for such foolishness as volunteering to serve in the great war.Others have summarized the movie so well, so I'll just mention a couple of scenes that moved me the most. When Boris' brother reveals to his family that he has broken trust with his brother and has to marry Tatiana, Tatiana's twisted mouth shows her revulsion at this betrayal (even though her part in the unfaithfulness might have been through rape). You fear that the rest of the movie might right this wrong by visiting just destruction on Tatiana and the brother, or worse, show Tatiana destroyed by an immoral descent into cigarette smoking decadence. Since this isn't French existential cinema, the latter doesn't happen. Thankfully! Another scene that tears at your heart is when the unnamed musician soldier who was saved by Boris returns to tell Boris' father of the death of his son. He unwittingly breaks the news to Tatiana. I can't describe the sorrow of this scene... Still,Tatiana finds finds a straw to grab and hope that Boris will yet come home. The musician actually never saw Boris buried, after all.I won't mention more scenes, but do want to observe that the touches of Soviet political correctness didn't detract at all from the film. Boris' brother is revealed as the piano playing anti-soviet slacker that someone who steals his brother's wife-to-be would have to be. No doubt he gets at least a tenner at the conclusion of the film! The ending, when Tatiana finally learns for certain that Boris is dead, still manages to end with cheerfully and full of hope for the future. You don't even want to imagine the tears and catharsis that must have swept through the theater when survivors of that war, with their own losses in mind, first saw this movie.Incredible. Go see it.

The expert use of symbolism in this film also contributes to the overall message. One of the most important symbols used in this film is rotation the rotation in the film implies a sort of image in how things spiral down in life. The film also does a good job of developing characters. The protagonist of the film, Veronika, is representative of the nation as a whole. She represents the guilt brought on by being the survivor in war as well as the hope associated with new beginnings. The entirety of the film is mostly heartbreaking; however, the message at the end of the film is a hopeful one.

Sometimes those films are unknown to most people. The Cranes Are Flying is one of those films. Made in Soviet Russia in 1957, the films starts with the romance of Veronika and Boris, a romance that is rudely interrupted when he volunteers to go to the front during WWII. After the lose of her own family, Boris' family invite her to live with them, only for his brother who found exemption from fighting 'forcing' her into marriage. The family are forced to move to Siberia to escape the onslaught of the Germans and it is here Veronika learns the fate of her real love.The film's main plot, the love story, is tragic, but the film as a whole is as tragic in it's depiction of war and the immense effect it has on people. Through fine performances the cast bring another episode of war to life, with drama, joy, despair and hope. Director Mikhail Kalatozov achieves something else, a masterpiece of film making. The film contains some of the most remarkable camera work you'll likely to see in a pre-CGI film world. One of the early scenes where Boris runs up flights of stairs as the camera pans and follows in one take is a hint of things to come. That scene is mirrored when Veronika returns to her family apartment to find it bombed and runs up the same stairwell, that hangs among the ruins and fire. There are fine tracking shots, such as where Veronica runs along the dispatch area or when she runs along the train track. Another stand out scene is where Veronica is 'trapped' by the brother during an air raid, the noise loud, the camera angles obscure, the lighting jarred and ominous, it's a powerful moment, among many throughout the film.The audience learns the fate of Boris way before Veronica, who tries to hang onto hope that he will return. Her love grows ever more when she discovers the note he left in the toy squirrel. The powerful end scenes, when the truth is revealed are stunningly effective, full of emotion and the horror of what war can create in people.War films are often too busy concentrating on the battles itself, but occasionally a film will explore the real battle, the one that humanity has to endure on a personal level.More of my reviews at iheartfilms.weebly.com "},{"Title":"Russian grapes of war","Date":"28 April 2010","Score":"3 out of 4 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama, Romance, War","Review":" The Cranes Are Flying is a film just as mesmerizing as the title suggests. It's stark and poetic, emotional but existential, it's about human nature, human life, human circumstance. The story is a simple and often told one, but then again, the stories of life tend to be simple and often told. The heart of the film lies in the very beginning where the two young lovers Veronika (Tatyana Samojlova) and Boris (Aleksey Batalov) stand in each other's arms and watch the cranes flying in the sky. They love each other. They don't know it yet, but they are about to be separated by war. This is the first and last moment of peace, harmony and love in their lives. The rest of their years are going to be filled with heartache, guilt, hardships, hunger, grief, death. The film ends on a hopeful and even joyous note. You have to see it to believe it.This is the first point. Very simple. It's a wonderful film that you should see. Then there are the historical notes, and the technical qualities to marvel about. Based on a play by Viktor Rozov, who wrote the screenplay, the film was directed by Mikhail Kalatozov who was one of the first Soviet filmmakers to emerge and blossom after Stalin's death (he was his former head of production). He would make tremors with his 1964 pro-Castro documentary I Am Cuba, but The Cranes Are Flying won him the Palme D'Or in 1957. It's no wonder either, not only does the film prove amazing craftsmanship but it would also remind anyone of a more general European art film from the same time (the French New Wave easily comes into mind). At the same time, it seems to have managed to pass all of the demands from the Soviet Union. It doesn't come off as a patriotic spectacle of propaganda but, as I said, it does end hopefully, with the love for the people shining from within the people itself.Tatyana Samojlova is the heroine of the film, and Kalatozov is occupied following her with the greatest of care. Much of the film is portrayed in silence, but it's not the kind of artistic silent quality you might expect. It's a quiet film, the absence of sound is naturalistic, as are the cranes in the sky and the feelings of Veronika as her childish romance dies out while she grows older in the war times. She loves Boris, lost in field. She marries a man she doesn't love. The film suggests feelings of guilt and shame. We're not sure, Samojlova is too human. There are breathtaking moments of film making in this film that, made in 1956, seems to predate most original methods of film making - and, I'd say, to this day it's not often you see sequences like the one where she is desperate, running along a train seemingly at the same speed, whilst the film itself seems to react at the sudden impact of speed and emotion. It's like the entire film looses control over itself, she almost outruns it herself, and you can't say what will happen the very next second or, once that second has passed, the second after that.This is a film about human beings, the value of human life, of love and family and hope. But it's not entirely an anti-war film, as one might suppose. This is a film where the characters face their sadness and their emotional tragedies right up front and never tries to deny them or shun from them, or in any way prolong their suffering. There is a higher cause and life must be lived by the citizens of an entire country in hope, because if we loose hope the suffering will have been pointless.

They represent the freedom to realize your life as you wish, in order to aspire the greatest possible fulfilment.In the beginning Veronica and Boris experience such a promise of happiness, and their eyes follow the path of the cranes in exhilaration. It seems as if they might be able to live according to their dreams.But Man is not a bird. Life draws up its own rules, from which no human can escape and which we cannot change - not even by making a supreme effort. War breaks out, and without much hesitation Boris signs up for the front in order to fulfil his patriotic duty. He cannot even say good-bye to Veronica, for she arrives late at the assembly point from which the soldiers are sent away. Surrounded by a jubilant crowd all her attempts to attract Boris' attention must inevitably fail.Boris eventually gets killed in war, without Veronica learning about it for the moment. His brother Mark, a vigorous musician, who obtained the exemption from military service by corruption, is eager to take his place. Veronica initially resists, but in a frightful night of bombing she finally falls victim to his charms. A marriage takes place, which is never accepted by the family.Soon feelings of guilt seize hold of Veronica and she realizes that Boris' return is the one and only thing she actually longs for. She therefore eases her bad conscience and  despair by the self-sacrificing work in a field hospital.When war finally is over, once again a crowd of enthusiastic people gathers in order to cheer the victorious soldiers. Again Veronica is among them, forcing her way through a wall of bodies. In her hand she is carrying a bunch of flowers, until she finally has to give it away to complete strangers, for one of the homecomers has just dashed her hopes by confirming the sad certainty of Boris' death.Once again the cranes invade the sky, drawing their wayward lines. But now Veronica is watching them on her own, and the look in her eyes is a different one. She has had to accept the impossibility to live according to preconceived plans, to follow the guidelines of your dreams. For all humans are nothing but helpless puppets hanging on the inscrutable strings of fate.

Two paralleled sequences where they sneak back to their respective bedrooms also signify the affections are mutual. Then Soviet Unions declare war in WWII, a patriotic Boris volunteers to join the army with his friend Stepan (Zubkov), he leaves a toy squirrel as a gift for Veronica's upcoming birthday as squirrel is his term of endearment to her, he conceals a note for her inside the squirrel's basket too, but Veronica is delayed en route to his send-off party, and woefully they miss the chance to see each other for the last time, till death do them apart, Boris' wedding imagination before his death is heavenly heart-rending.War also takes its toll on ordinary people, Veronica's parents died in an air raid, and their house has been destroyed, without any information from Boris, she is helped by Fyodor (Merkurev), Boris' father and the chief surgeon in a local hospital, and lives with his family, where Mark (Shvorin), Boris' cousin, a handsome musician who gets an exemption from recruitment, and has always coveted Veronica, forces himself on her during a nerve-racking air raid. Soon Veronica capitulates and marries Mark. Plagued by her guilty of betrayal and Mark's exposure of his unscrupulous nature, Veronica is under severe distress and attempts to end her life (another mesmerising sequences where Veronica running hastily to the railway station, are montages of a succession of quick-edited shots-in-motion, fervently emotive and transfixing to behold), but instead, she saves a 3-year-old boy also named Boris, which gives her strength to hold on. When bad news finally arrives, Veronica becomes brave enough to face it and holds a tiny chance that a miracle can happen, until the war ends, she meets Stepan, she accepts the fact and has no more illusions, her life must continue, as the flying cranes in the sky.From every respect, THE CRANES ARE FLYING is bordering on perfection, Kalatozov's poetic aesthetics and his effective principle of keeping up an intimate observation on the subjects in the frame, Urusevskiy's erratic shooting angles, the impressionistic chiaroscuro are all textbook exemplars. And the comely Tatyana Samoylova, who shoulders on a gallant and insightful performance as our pertinacious heroine, depicts a transcendent maturation from a carefree girl to a gutsy woman under the ablution of war, an iconic endeavour indeed. When all is said and done, the film is another weighty testament of how advanced and innovative Soviet Union was in the world cinema production, a trailblazer emphatically!

The Red Army was always depicted victorious and the people had to believe they were working to create a communist paradise. But during the post-war period, movie production nearly stopped because of increased political prosecutions and the limited number of permitted themes and directing styles. After Stalin's death in 1953, the pro-Stalinist propaganda ended and the movie industry slowly recovered. The Cranes Are Flying was the first war movie that exploited this situation, showed the tragedy of losing loved ones in war, and exposed war profiteering and draft dodging. It is still the only Russian movie to have won the Palme D'Or at the Cannes Film Festival.In Moscow, during World War II, Veronika (Tatyana Samoylova) is deeply in love with Boris (Aleksey Batalov), and is devastated to discover he has joined the army. After he leaves, her parents are killed in a bombing of the city and she moves in with Boris' family &#x96; his father Fyodor Ivanovich (Vasili Merkuryev), cousin Mark (Aleksandr Shvorin), sister Irina (Svetlana Kharitonova) and grandmother (Antonina Bogdanova). Mark is in love with Veronika but she rejects his advances. Tired of being rejected, he rapes her and she decides to marry him out of shame, but still waits and hopes for Boris' return.Like I said, this is the first Soviet movie that portrays war as it truly is tragic. Fighting a war is not heroic, Boris and the other soldiers are not invincible and their generals are not infallible. There is no honour in dying in a muddy swamp after being shot by the enemy. Draft dodgers may be viewed as cowards, their behavior may bring shame to their families, but still they are the ones who will surely survive and lead a normal life after the war is over. War has no positive qualities, and this is perfectly portrayed in the movie while Boris and Veronika are together in Moscow, the weather is sunny and warm; as soon as he leaves, and until the end of the movie, the atmosphere is dark, gloomy, cold &#x96; most notably when Veronika and Boris' family escape to an unnamed place in Siberia. The cinematography is impressive we feel the characters' strong emotions without them having to say a word.The cinematographer Sergei Uruseveky's use of hand-held cameras should be mentioned, as it was extremely innovative at the time. Interestingly, he learned it when he was a military cameraman during the war. This technique helped convey the feeling of tension, like in the scene where Veronika hurries to meet Boris before he leaves for the front &#x96; as she's trying to make her way through the crowd, the camera closely follows her, just like a friend. Tatyana Samoylova's role was ground-breaking as well her character is a normal woman who doesn't care about nationalism, she just wants to be with the person she loves. From this moment on, Soviet cinema started creating more complicated heroines. The rest of the cast is excellent and very convincing as well, and this only makes the movie better. It's impossible to remain indifferent when watching this classic, favored by both Francis Ford Coppola and Martin Scorsese. The Cranes are Flying is a must see for everyone, a symbol of the importance of peace, and the destructive inevitability of war.Rating 10/10 Read more at https//passpopcorn.wordpress.com/ "},{"Title":"love   under  the  ash","Date":"14 April 2012","Score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama, Romance, War","Review":" war. love story. anonymous heroes of a large world. the story is old but in this case is unique. because it is story of a time. death of Stalin, new image of Soviet Union and need to present the truth behind every mask. so - strange themes. sacrifice of a generation. compromises, fake image of society, solitude as cage, malleability of feelings, forms of sacrifice, search of sense out of ordinary forms, hope, fight against interior shadows, force to make borders of future, peace as basket of memories. all - pieces from extraordinaries images - crumbs from Potemkin - in skin of honest view about existence.

Don't get me wrong.  THE CRANES ARE FLYING is, for the first half at least, supremely entertaining, boasting a lightness of touch completely unexpected from its country of origin; a fresh, brisk, spacious technique that eventually irritates as much as it initially charms; two stunning subjective set-pieces; and a romantic verve that flirts with, but never quite topples into, Lelouch territory.  It's just that , in its subsuming of vast social, national and world events to a love affair, it is essentially no different from a conventional Hollywood movie.Of course, in a Soviet Union that emphasised the state above all else, and in an era (World War Two) that suppressed individualism and liberty to uphold murderous symbolism, this foregrounding of two appealing young lovers is a relief.  And the thematic similarities - all consuming love rent apart by war - with two of the most wonderful of all films (SEVENTH HEAVEN, LES PARAPLUIES DE CHERBOURG) also adds to its potential loveability.The story is simple enough.  Boris, a young factory worker from a bright medical and artistic family, and Veronika, a student, conduct a breezy relationship at night, their only free time.  Boris's cousin Mark, a composer, also has eyes on Veronika.  When the Nazis invade Russia, Boris secretly volunteers, to the chagrin of his family and lover.  He promises to write to Veronika, but never does, thinking maybe she hasn't bothered to see him off, or perhaps the mail is simply unreliable.  Veronika's parents die during an air raid, and she moves in with Boris's family, helping out at the hospital where his father tends wounded soldiers.Distressed by Boris's silence, Veronika is also assailed by the attentions of Mark, who has gained exemption from military duty by bribing a local official.  She is eventually worn down, and marries him, to the disapproval of her adopted family.  Boris, meanwhile, is killed in action.  Veronika, disgusted with herself and an adulterous Mark, refuses to believe this, and awaits his return, fostering a young orphan bearing his name.The title refers to the birds the couple see at the height of their love, symbolic perhaps of its transcendant, epiphanical power.  But this is illusory - the cranes fly in a V formation, and this shape pervades the entire film, through the geometric shapes of buildings, interiors, exteriors, groupings of people, composition, camera angles, the heroine's name - or by editing in which feet walking southwest in one story are met by feet walking southeast in another.  This serves to fatally trap the lovers who have no control over their destinies, and also suggest the Stalinist power that is never, specifically, mentioned in the film.  Although the pair seem to be free in space, whether literally in an unpeopled environment, or privileged in generous close-ups, they are always ironised, minimised, torn apart - by circumstances, families, by crowds (see the brilliant, if obvious, sequences where Veronika is engulfed by tanks, or the pair fail to meet in a huge crowd), or simply by the film's structure, which is constantly distancing, through paralellism, their closeness. Although at the beginning, the lightness and brightness of style suggest a beautiful romantic idyll, it is constantly being broken  by strange edits or camera angles of distracting snatches of music.What is most remarkable is how these blocks to romance are achieved by abstracting rather than emphasising historical forces.  The whole film, but especially the war itself, is strangely unreal and dreamlike, we are never shown its harsh, brutal actuality, just its effects on the lovers.  In fact, it is transformed into a majestic spectacle, devoid of nasty Germans. On the home front, the air raids create delicious effects of light and shade, or ruins of almost Gothic decadence.  In the bunker, the threat to the Soviet empire is less important  than Boris's perceived indifference.  The empty, oneiric Moscow spaces the lovers initially, than Veronika with her mother, walk though are less actual locations than emotional spaces. When Mark tries to force himself on Veronika, the air raid is less a destructive reality than a symbolic release of sexual and emotional frustrations.  This is a brilliant sequence, filmed with silent, Expressionistic terror, in which the screen seems to burst with hysteria and violence, all the more compelling for the earlier scenes' wistful gentleness.It's not much different at the front either, where fights over girls' honour are more urgent than tactics, Nazis or despair.  The movement of Boris and his wounded comrade into a final space is a further abstracting of the experience of war, its setting in a forest giving it a sexual dynamic; and Boris' final, pre-death flashback is an extraordinary mixture of dream-wish fulfillment and heightened anxiety, in which what is wished for becomes menacing and grotesque.From this point on the film becomes a little less interesting, slightly more obvious.  One more grasp for Expressionist overload - Veronika's attempted suicide and her rescuing the infant - is clumsily handled; and her sombre guilt casts a paralysing shadow  over the whole film.  The use of deep focus, at first ravishing, soon becomes wearing, devoid as it is of any of the moral force or meaning Welles brought to its use in CITIZEN KANE.  After what seems a quietly sly critique of totalitarianism in favour of the individual is cruelly betrayed at the end, when individual suffering, as so often in Russian art, transmutes into symbolic (i.e. sexless, dehumanised) hope.

The film then proceeds to show the hardships of life that Veronika has to endure as her parents are killed in a bombing raid and she goes to live with Boris' family who feel obliged to take her in for his sake. It's at this time that Boris' cousin Mark (Aleksandr Shvorin) takes advantage of the situation and Veronika grudgingly marries him afterward. Now rather than reveal any more of this movie and risk spoiling it for those who haven't seen it I will just say that this movie is a rare example of Soviet filmmaking at its best. As a matter of fact, it has the distinction of being the only Soviet film to win the Palm d'Or at the Cannes Film Festival. Additionally, Tatyana Samoylova was also awarded a Special Mention at that same event for her performance as well. In short, this is a remarkable movie and I highly recommend it to all of those who appreciate films of this type.

It tells the story of two young lovers who are separated by the arrival of World War II. The film commemorates the lives that were lost in the Soviet Union during the war (between 22 and 30 million, more than in any other country). It observes patriotic self-sacrifice and heroism, but also builds a compelling anti-war message by illustrating the suffering and trauma that the Soviets had to endure during those years of human tragedy. Certain scenes even betray a hint of cynicism towards the government's official discourse. Apparently, this sort of nuance only became possible under the Communist regime after the death of Stalin in 1953.The director operates in two different modes one is a form of melodrama that feels a bit rigid and contrived; the other is a daring display of inspired, almost surrealistic flares in which the imagery takes off deliriously, as if suddenly propelled by a boost of adrenaline. This latter style is more lyrical and sets the film apart from the standard.Kalatozov is also famous for his 1964 effort, 'I am Cuba', a piece of Communist propaganda that I find overrated. The camera-work, carried out by the same cinematographer, Sergei Urusevsky, is again exceptional and I can see why people like Scorcese hail its virtuosity. But unlike 'The Cranes are Flying', 'I am Cuba' is ruined by bad acting and the use of political caricature. Even in Havana, the film was criticized by the audience upon its original release for giving a stereotypical view of Cubans.'The Cranes are Flying' may have some flaws, but it's still quite impressive and relevant today. I can honestly say that I was shaken by it. "},{"Title":"The ideas and energy are pure cinematic magic.","Date":"10 July 2013","Score":"","Genre":"Drama, Romance, War","Review":" Just like the film's young lovers, The Cranes Are Flying, has a naive and adolescent approach to its heavy material. Famous for re-igniting Soviet cinema in the post-Stalin era and for winning the Palme D'or at the Cannes film festival, the film's style isn't too far away from the bombast of Hollywood, even for today's standards. Much of its sequences are very loose, often conceptual, perhaps not taking enough care for its characters despite the relationships being the proposed centrepiece. However, the true star of the film, is the incredibly cinematography. The camera goes to places where I didn't even know it could go. Cranes are particularly used inventively, with an unforgettable shot from hand-held in a bus to high in the air all in the same take and also a shot of a character going up some spiral stairs with the camera following him in the centre of the staircase. It's remarkably bold.Unfortunately, while this film does have some intense dramatic moments, what it does lack is a focused protagonist. It opens with the main couple together then refuses to choose which perspective the film is told from. This doesn't keep it from being rather poignant, if they are just to represent any man and any woman in this scenario rather than being developed characters - this is probable in a scene where the woman is a nurse treating soldiers and the soldier is a victim to a similar tale she's involved in but not connected to. It's a very engaging film, the highlights being the magnificent canvases of disorientating camera-work and powerful editing during the most vivid and exaggerated sequences and held back by the domestic moments where it doesn't quite know how to approach it. Regardless, the ideas and energy are pure cinematic magic.8/10 "},{"Title":"the urges of the world, and the space that surrounds them","Date":"1 October 2009","Score":"","Genre":"Drama, Romance, War","Review":" When you take your life as a film watcher seriously, you start deciding you own own special things you like to observe in films. That can be as simple as wanting to see films depicting certain themes (that's superficial to me), or observing how certain things are handled. In my case, and because i am, primarily, an architect, i care about how that is handled in film. It's not so much a matter of how the built world (architecture) is depicted, as i initially thought, but how the space is handled. It is not illustrative cinema what i look for, the kind of footage we have in most of the ordinary architecture documentaries. It's interpretations of space, ways to place us in those spaces, bended to the intentions of who films them. For that specific corner of film possibilities that i love, Kalatozov is one of the most interesting directors ever. He does handle space. In doing so he simultaneously works with framing, editing and, specially, camera movement (thus the cranes). I think he should be credited for these experiences along with the brilliant Urusevsky, two complementing and crazy visions. Their master work, definitely, is Soy Cuba, which has to be one of the most perfect visions of a lifetime work. That one is a perfect film in pretty much everything that you see. This one, to me, paves the way to the later one, but what a powerful experience it is on its own.Check what we have here - right at the beginning, the geometry of the composition that includes the stone from the stairs, the shadow of that stone, and the movement of the characters within that frame; - still at the beginning, the stairs scene. All the games that include editing, and those beautiful spiral camera moves up the stairs, and perfect framings of the stair pits. These stairs are a fundamental metaphor for the story, and they come back to our eyes, half destroyed, later on. From the point of view of the matching of space/architecture/camera, this is the most powerful moment in the film, that will stay long after i saw it; - all the sequences between crowds. These have a pretext, always the same, Veronika looking for Boris, early in the film she tries to find him so she can say goodbye, and at the very end, she still hopes to find him. This is powerful because it suffocates us, placing us as one among many. Those are strong spatial scenes which, still, depict very little built elements of the environment. It's about people and how we/camera and Veronika walk around or through it. This is the true nature of Kalatozov's eye. So powerful.Apart from these scenes which matter specially to me, we have two brilliant pieces of editing, which probably should be credited more to Urusevsky -The implied rape scene where shadow/light, bomb sounds, and a piano score are the very definition of the drama we follow Veronika cross. Perfect editing, subtle camera work, perfect close up framing (Samoilova's face was precious); -Boris' death. To me it's less powerful than the other one, but still it works in ways that move you beyond surface.So, back to space concerns we have geometric framing; we have camera movement and editing attached to an architectural space; and we have a disembodied spatial camera that moves without built references. What a visual glossary! What more can you want? This would be good enough, but Kalatozov/Urusevsky expanded our minds, and gave us Soy Cuba. What great lives they had.My opinion 4/5 http//www.7eyes.wordpress.com "},{"Title":"A Cut too Far","Date":"21 July 2008","Score":"","Genre":"Drama, Romance, War","Review":" I watched this movie on TCM last night, all excited expectation, having last seen it (twice) in its memorable 1957 release in Toronto. I told my wife, who hadn't seen it before, to watch for the thrilling long tracking shot, no cuts, where Veronika is seen on a bus on her way to find her Boris. In a hand-held frame that certainly predates the modern Steadicam, the shot then pulls back up and cranes (pun unintended) over the street as she exits the bus, and darts among the tanks to cross the road. THEN I remember that, no cuts, we follow her up close to the fence as she peers through, anxiously looking for him, but does not find him. But we do continue to follow Veronika as she searches the faces of harried recruits and their emotionally racked women, all extras, and each one a gem of riveting Stanislavskian behavior. How, one wonders, did Kalatozov and his cameraman Urusevsky set up this extraordinary sequence. But what did I see in this version? After crossing the street dodging the tanks, the scene abruptly ended, and cut back to scenes at the apartment, before continuing to the soldiers and their families at the fence. Seems to me that this film was not only restored, but also re-edited. What a downer!

The film's images are so gorgeous, that you'll be carried away - the film technique is in perfect unison with the emotion.There are few scenes that portray directly the war A bombing - wind, lightnings, explosions - that will have important consequences in the life of the main protagonist, Veronika, who waits for the return of Boris; and there's another scene on the front, where we we will be confronted by a emotional/visual hurricane showing the images played in Boris' mind. Another scene works as the leitmotif of the film and provides its title - the cranes flying in the sky. This image stands as a the symbol for Nature and its seasons and underlines the final message of the film Not to give up hope and fight for a better future.Kalatozov is a great director, this film is visually stunning and it also touched me deeply. It is not just pure technique. Tatyana Samojlova is perfect as Veronika. What more can I say? The film transcends the time it was made - the action takes place during the Second World War.

Imagine Umbrellas of Cherbourg with no music and no color, or Waterloo Bridge with no class consciousness.Tatiana Samoilova, a cross between Vivien Leigh and Bjork, is deeply affecting as a pretty girl whose fiancé enlists and doesn't write or come back.The fiancé, Boris, dies on the front, and his death scene is indescribably romantic. Very daring too, because so close to over the top. But that scene will stay with you.Although the Soviets were so defined by WWII, the movie is quite unspecific, and more powerful for it. The pre-war and post-war scenes have a very 1957 feel. There is no attempt at period detail. The whole film becomes more and more stylized, until the Siberian scenes, which feel like a modern opera set (that is a compliment). The cathartic final scene is milked to its last drop - there again, comparable to Cherbourg. The production feels like a big budget (those staircase scenes must have cost a pretty kopek).Go for it. Don't expect a bitter socialist pill (although it is, of course, very sad). The Cranes are Flying is an impressive slice of world cinema, quite advanced considering where and when it was made.

This is a WW II movie that focuses more on what happens to those who are not fighting and are at home, waiting for their beloved ones to return home safely. This is not unique but what is sort of unique is that it's doing it without falling into the usual clichés and isn't using any false sentiments to fuel its drama. This is really foremost why Letyat zhuravli works out as both an original drama and WW II movie.And it's an Soviet movie, so that already means that it's being different from anything you're probably accustomed to. Soviet movies at the time always had a very distinctive- and powerful style and atmosphere over it, this one included. Yes, you could also really call it a propaganda movie (especially toward its end it's really starting to head into that direction) but this is of course not necessarily a bad thing. As a matter of fact, it's even what makes some Soviet movies even more interesting to watch, in todays light and retrospective.One thing that almost immediately becomes apparent about this movie, is that it's an incredible well shot one. Its camera-work is fantastic and they used some unique shots for this movie. But also with all of its close-ups and large crowed scenes, it's a great looking black & white movie, that uses some fine lighting as well.It also helps the movie that it's being a quite short one. Before thing start to dwell on and before things can get too melodramatic, it's over already. 90 minutes (and a bit) was basically the perfect running time for this movie.As far as war movies, mixed with drama and romance go, this is definitely one of the better and more unique movies to watch.8/10http//bobafett1138.blogspot.com/ "},{"Title":"as if one is leafing through some master photographer's album","Date":"16 November 2008","Score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama, Romance, War","Review":" Fabulous cinematography from Sergei Urusevsky help to make this a stunning piece of work.

Cinema was then not only one form of arts. It was much higher than ordinary life and it gave many people hope to live after the tragic war. It is said, that even Picasso was moved and cried that such a work of art can appear only once in 100 years! Audience that time was also different. I read that after seeing Kurosawa's Ikiru(Live) in its first release, young couple quietly told each other,It is a good film, isn't it?.

At such moments, it's strange, to say the least.Something that offended me was the film's pretense that the USSR had not been one of the three aggressors of World War II since September 1939 -- when it invaded Estonia, Lithuania, Latvia, Poland (seizing about 35% of Poland's territory which was never relinquished), and later Finland (seizing territory which was never returned), and Romania (again, seizing a chunk which has never been returned). In this film, it is only when the USSR is invaded almost two years later, that characters shout WAR!

Boris, meanwhile, continues trotting through the countryside, fighting the Nazis and experiencing all the horrors of war, until he he runs out of energy. When Veronika - working in a military hospital - receives this news, she refuses to accept it, until Boris' body arrives home on one of the trains. Simultaneously, the radio announces that Germany has surrendered and the Allied Powers have won the war; the Soviet Union lost 27 million citizens, but it's the start of a new era.This movie did a very good job showing the human impact of the war not only in the battlefield, but also how it affected the civilian population. This is definitely a movie that everyone should see.

Unfortunately, just before they marry, WWII comes along and despite their plans, Boris responds to the call of duty and volunteers to fight. They are both heartbroken, but duty is duty. Shortly after this, Veronika's parents are killed in an air raid, so she moves in with Boris' family.At this point, the movie becomes a bit confusing and this is one case where I really wish the film had been more explicit. Boris' no-good cousin is living at the apartment along with the family and during an air raid, he attacks Veronika and begins kissing her despite her protests. Then, inexplicably, in the next scene they announce they are getting married! Either he won her over with passion or he raped her and she oddly felt that since he violated her she should marry him (that's twisted logic). It makes a big difference--if she just lost interest in Boris that easily, it really doesn't make sense since they were so in love and after marrying, she acts like she loves him as much as ever. But, if she was raped, she is a far more sympathetic and tragic figure.Now apart from that, the movie is marvelous. The camera-work (especially when Boris is shot and he is imagining the wedding that never was), acting and production was amazing. So much so, by the end I really had to fight back the tears (after all, I'm a guy and guys NEVER let themselves cry,...except when Jim Brown gets killed in THE DIRTY DOZEN). A very loving and beautiful film that greatly humanizes the face and cost of war.

The best I could manage was a sort of admiration. Agreed, previously taboo subjects were touched upon but this remains a work of Socialist Realism, the characters like granite statues--handsome but not quite human. Though their talent is undeniable, the male and female leads are a bit too old for a story that at least at the outset is about young love.The events are compressed, as another commenter pointed out, the suddenness with which war comes being a backhanded slap at the all wise Stalin who trusted Hitler and left the Soviet Union dangerously unprepared when Nazi Germany attacked with over a hundred divisions. Nor is all well at the fighting front. Soldiers brawl over trifles and incompetent generals let their men be trapped and slaughtered by an unseen enemy. But this is not so boldly controversial a message as may seem. Stalin himself had these disgraced but often innocent generals sacked--several were shot--in the wake of the early and disastrous defeats the Red Army suffered.The camera work is innovative for the time. Even now it is striking. But color movies were unknown in the Soviet Union in 1959 which is unfortunate. For a more appealing treatment of the subject, compare Ballad of Soldier, a 1960 effort also in black and white but featuring genuinely young actors and a more human story. "}{"Title":"Leftist movie on the hardship of war.","Date":"2 December 2008","Score":"3 out of 12 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama, Romance, War","Review":" I often find that Russian cinema in general is very often interesting at the least, particularly because of their cinematography, which always elevates the technical standards from a film. Under this aspect, it can be said that Russian cinema has not decreased in quality since the early days of Vertov and Eisenstein.The cinematography here is brilliant. We witness beautifully co-ordinated shots like the one in the staircase, as Boris runs up to Veronica in the early stages of the film, to ask her when their next encounter will be. This is a scene that shows the beauty of Russian youth during the pre-war days, the immaculate image of hope. This scene itself actually show casts another great aspect of the film, which is the editing, when it is re-used later on when Boris gets shot.On that note, I must also add that that is a great turning point. Boris gets shot. We always suspect it will happen, from early on in fact, when we see that Mark has feelings for Veronika. However, we don't want it to happen, and in the end, although we have witnessed him dying, saw him breathless on the ground after a great montage as I mentioned before which inter-cuts with images of the wedding with Veronika that he will never had, and with the beautiful shot from the early stages of the film when he ran up to her on the staircase.It is, however, far from being a flawless movie. It almost collapses under the emotional weight that it carries, and becomes an obnoxious film that is supposed to lecture us on our behaviors towards the people at war. Its views are, expectedly very leftist. And these views become cliché from the moment we see Mark with Veronika, which is early on in the film. Mark is the coward, because he doesn't want to go to war. Veronika never falls for him, and in the eyes of Kalatozov, it is in fact because he is a coward. And it doesn't matter that he is a good person. We never see him lay a hand on Veronika and at some stage he hopelessly asks her what he can do to make her happy. She replies 'Just disappear'. That is a harsh reply, and we can't help sympathize with Mark for trying to make her happy.WATCH FOR THE MOMENT - When Boris is shot. I mentioned above why. "},{"Title":"Take Back Your Minsk","Date":"16 June 2004","Score":"4 out of 14 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama, Romance, War","Review":"  It's always problematical to watch an acknowledged 'classic' several decades after its initial release.  Within two days I have been able to watch no less than 4 titles that fall within this category; the trilogy comprising 'Marius', 'Fanny' and 'Cesar' and now this Russian entry produced some 20 years later. There is also the problem of watching something produced when Russia was still very much a Communist country and the ordinary man in the Western street knew little or nothing about life there and almost inevitably brings pre-conceived ideas to bear.  Watching the film I was subconsciously looking for overt signs of oppression - fifteen families sharing an apartment, people dressed in drab, shapeless clothes, etc - so it was disconcerting to see first the protagonists dressed very much in 'Western' style clothes (to say nothing of a pre-credit sequence in which the lovers cavort on the banks of a large river that could, with a stretch of the imagination, be the Seine, especially when the background music is supplied by an accordian) and note that each has a room of their own in their respective apartments.  In fact the whole mood of the first half hour or so seems unrealistically buoyant as if to repudiate the impression of dour, downtrodden people with no room in heavy hearts for the souffles that characterise young love.  There is nothing in this story that girls/women in the West couldn't read any week in their Redbook, McCall's or Woman's Own; two lovers parted by war, whilst the man is at the front the girl succumbs to the wooing of another suitor though still retaining her love for the first; the soldier/lover dying miles away from his beloved and all played out against a backdrop of War.  Yet against the odds - and a terrible print that 'jumped' constantly at the end of a sequence into the next - the film succeeds in holding the attention even as we are wondering where the hell we are - for nothing, especially the exteriors, says 'Russia' and we could be anywhere, or at least anywhere where huge slabs of concrete edifices dwarf the people - and the central performances win us over.  It's possible that time, plus its reputation have worked against what is undoubtedly a fine film and had I been able to see it on its initial release I feel sure I would have joined in the universal acclaim.  7/10 "},{"Title":"...petulant, selfish anti-heroine makes film virtually unwatchable.","Date":"7 November 2007","Score":"6 out of 21 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama, Romance, War","Review":" I apologize to those who liked this film. It is very difficult to get passed the main premise in the film which is nebulous, at best, and impossible to circumvent, no matter how grand and astounding the cinematography is, Veronica's character, and Veronica herself. I did not enjoy watching her ideals and ordeals on the screen. This petulant, selfish anti-heroine makes the the film virtually unwatchable. The grand achievement is the cinematography, which can never become a character on its own in any film, but is so remarkable that I do believe it is right up there in the number one spot with Citizen Kane, maybe slightly even above it if considered on it's own. The problem, of course, is an unsympathetic (to me anyway) protagonist who essentially wallows in self absorption (with a few momentary refrains) the whole time. Well, I haven't seen many Soviet movies from those decades, it may be considered one of the best. The next time I watch this film maybe I will turn the sound off. Among many other different, interesting constituents the film expresses the IDEA of love, but never does it even touch love itself. "}]
