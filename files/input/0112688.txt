It is not an easy film.  It is bleak and at times very off-putting.  Actually, if you are a thinking, caring person, this is movie is overall heart-breaking.But it is brilliant and, for the person who truly tries to understand it, a compelling, insightful look at the problems killing black America today.  The only reason for the film's lack of recognition I can imagine is that its subject matter had been examined a number of times before.  But the inescapable fact is that this one of the best examinations of the subject matter there has been on screen - on par with Boyz N The Hood.And it is FAR from uncreative.  In fact, on one level, it is not a hood movie, but a whodunit.  The mystery aspect of the plot is very interesting.  But there are other, more important layers.  It is the story of the confusion and crisis of a young man's life.  Most importantly, it is a brutal look at drugs, guns, and life in the projects.  It is a movie asking why so many young black men are dying in the streets.The lead character Strike has a stomach problem.  It might be an ulcer or something like that.  I believe it is a metaphor.  Just as heat represented racial tension in Lee's masterpiece Do The Right Thing, Strike's sickness represents the illnesses plaguing the ghetto drugs, guns, liquor.Like DTRT, this film looks at community.  The mothers, the cops, the young people, the kids, the men trying to make a living - there is eloquent commentary in Clockers on the situations of all.  In Spike's movies, paying a little attention is rewarding.  A good essay could be written on what I call the Spike Summarization technique.  This is when Spike compresses a serious debate or concern in the black community into a few expressive moments of action or dialogue.  There are better examples in other movies, but it manifests in Clockers a few times.  A bunch of kids are sitting in front of Rodney's (Delroy Lindo) shop; one of the kids is rapping while the others pay attention.  The two sides to the coin we feel the artistry and skill of the moment, the continuation of a rich tradition of oral art; we're also struck by the cruelty and coldness in the kid's violent lyrics, and we think about where that comes from.Stylistically, this movie is a huge success.  The cinematography is amazing, and I wonder what must be wrong with my tastes when I'm floored by a film like this and find visually bland a more oft-praised classic.  The projects become blinding panoramas, landscapes which add tons of meaning to the poignant ending (I won't reveal it here).  The sound is great; many films of this nature use hip hop in the soundtrack to produce certain effects, but Clockers does it in a more methodical way which jars some people, but contributes to the film's meaning.I could say more about the film, but I encourage you to just see it, along with the rest of Spike's oeuvre.  He's not a perfect filmmaker, and some of his best films are marred by elements that don't work, but I feel his consistency in terms of delivering brilliance is not below most of the cinema's most celebrated auteurs.

Lee is justly famous for his incendiary agitprop films of ideas which dissect race relations and urban living, sometimes at the expense of cohesive storytelling; but working with source material as thought provoking a novel as Clockers, which is set in Lee's home base of Crooklyn, er, i mean Brooklyn, Spike finds the right mix of action, angst, and intellectualism for his strengths to shine.  Clockers are petty drug dealers who work around the clock pushing their wares. When one turns up dead and a stand up citizen steps up to take the fall, a homicide detective begins unraveling the complex dynamics of life and dealing in the 'hood.  Lee gets his usual gritty street landscape to work with and Price gets a director with a cinematic eye (thanks to standard Lee lens-er, Malik Hassan Sayeed)and a playwright's heart. Central character brothers Isaiah Washington and Mekhi Phifer (in his star making role) turn in complex credible performances but are easily outshone by the astonishingly strong acting out of Harvey Keitel, Delroy Lindo, Regina Taylor (who won awards for her work here), Keith David, and Lee regulars John Turturro and Thomas Byrd.  Lindo is particularly impressive.  This film may have been too gritty for general audiences with its brutal depiction of urban violence and emotional brutality. And it may have been a bit too stylized for the Saturday night drive-in set wanting a brainless shoot 'em up; but for  those interested in quality film making on a hugely important issue that also functions as an engaging who done it, Spike Lee does it up royal in this, perhaps Lee's most, accessible film.

However, looking at this film from the standpoint of having never read the book I thought the story was brilliant, it engrossed me to the end. Mekhi Phifer was great, he played the part well, personally I thought he conveyed a wide range of emotions and all of them very well. There was some great character development, especially on the part of Delroy Lindo (another great performance).Lee did a good job in his portrayal of the drug culture in the projects, as well as taking a look into the police's side of the story. The story interested me from the beginning and I didn't feel my interest waver once, in fact is grew steadily throughout the film. The images of dead bodies shown at the beginning made a strong starting point, and served as an immediate reminder that the themes dealt with in the film are occurring all the time.On a side note, I thought the resemblance of Shorty's game 'Gansta' to today's GTA San Andreas was pretty funny.

When someone kills one of Rodney's enemies Detective Klein (Keitel) investigates. Strike's brother Victor (Washington) confesses but suspicion points to Strike. Klein suspects that Victor is covering for his brother and begins to put the heat on Strike for more information.The main plot is a form of crime thriller, with Keitel playing the cop trying to uncover the truth behind the murder. However the plot is not what this film is about - this is basically a film about the effects on drugs on the NY ghettos. Strike is the average black man, while his protégé, Tyrone (Peewee Love) is black youth. The film tries to show the forces placed on them by their situation, their role models and the few options they have in life. Rodney represents the draw of selling drugs, of quick money while policemen Andre (Keith David) and Klein represent his conscience trying to get him to do the right thing - Andre and Tyrone's mother (Regina Taylor) particularly doing right by your own community.The message is at times forced, Keitel's sequence towards the end is very clever cinematically but feels a bit like a sermon, but at other times we're allowed to work it out ourselves. Strike is not judged but allowed to be pulled by the situation around him, his sickness representing the sickness of his situation. Through him we see the pressures that are on him to act like his peers and the bad role-models he has in his life. In Shorty we see the same things affect the next generation and, while his aping of Strike is clumsy, you again see how the lack of good role-models reduces the options for an otherwise intelligent kid. The best thing about the comparison of Lindo and Keitel is that neither is judged - both are allowed to show themselves as appealing, Lindo appears as a parent, almost seeking the best for all his workers and Keitel is allowed to be an honest cop with a good moral code. However both are also seen in a bad light, Lindo brings out the violence, pressure and treachery of his character - a man who is really out for himself while the way Keitel pressures Strike is seen as bad as Rodney's pressure and reveals a racist angry streak within himself. We are left wondering how anyone can survive between the two.Phifer is good as Strike and manages to avoid just doing a ghetto-movie type of performance, he makes you believe that he is trapped in a no-win situation. Isaiah Washington gives another in a string of strong performances as the honest man trying to get by. Lindo is great as drug dealer Rodney, mixing paternal aspirations with moments of sudden viciousness. Keitel and John Turturro act below their station and aren't given much to work with, Keitel especially doesn't always manage to carry the moral core of the story without preaching. Two small roles of interest are Tom Byrd as Errol who has plays the fallen dealer with AIDS, however not enough is explained about his character, also Michael Imperioli (better known as Chris in The Sopranos) plays bent cop Jo-Jo. Peewee Love stands out as Shorty/Shorty, sucked into a world that lacks choice.The film looks great, the whole thing has a bright colourful sheen on it that is very attractive to look at. Combined with Lee's stylish director it makes for a beautiful film - although some scenes are shot differently and on different stock, to make a point, although I'm not sure what that point is. The music is as good as most of Lee's movies, a mix of soul and hip hop, it is better than many ghetto films that just assume that the hip hop is all that's needed to help the mood.This is a good example of the lack of options that exist in the ghetto and, besides some very obvious preaching, it makes it's point without shouting it at the audience. The only failing is that Lee bottles it near the end, delivering a sentimental ending of hope that is unfortunately not the truth in many cases.

Upon re-viewing, I am struck again by its complexity.  It is the first urban drama to depict inner-city race relations with the intricacy such a pervasive cultural issue demands.  On the surface it resembles a whodunit, but its main concern is how drugs and violence contaminate entire communities, dramatized in the collapse of one African-American youth's life.  (He chokes up blood the way some of us sweat.)  This process is observed by a predominantly white police force that makes hollow attempts to keep order, and refuses to intervene with the community's gradual decline.Instead of characters with overt prejudices and plain racial allegiances-characters that are sterile symbols of bigotry rather than credible humans guilty of it-Lee gives us characters of casual racism. Most representative of this is Harvey Keitel's Rocco Klein, a white detective who cannot understand the culture surrounding him, which is a culture of narcotics, violence, and black-on-black crime.  On his beat, drugs are less a problem than a lifestyle, murder resolves the tiniest of disagreements, and young mothers valiantly but vainly battle the influence young dealers have on their sons.  Klein views the inner-city with contempt, but deep down he knows all the whores and dealers are human beings, too.Klein is introduced at the scene of a homicide, where the police handle the gruesome death with a clinical sense of detachment, cracking bad jokes and asking the bloodied corpse questions.  Is it just a job, or is it racism? For Klein, it's both he needs the gallows humor to psychologically deal with this culture of depravity.  What's fascinating about CLOCKERS is Lee's willingness-and guts-to present Klein, despite his prejudice, as the film's hero.  Lee understands that casual racism is simply endemic and inescapable in American culture.  What he appreciates is Klein's ability to transcend his own prejudice and finally do the right thing.

The movie takes place in no other city than New York, Spike Lee's trademark as a director. Strike (Phiefer) is a clocker who works with his friends in the park selling high potency drugs to neighborhood people, under the command of Rodney, the drug dealer of the area. Rodney tells Strike if he wants to get off the benches he should kill a man named Daryl who is selling ounces and making lots of cash, Strike considers it, but he isn't a killer. That night Strike's brother Victor comes into the bar and is mentally upset and talks to Strike. A little later Daryl is killed by four gunshots, one in the leg, one in the head, one in the chest, and one caught between his teeth. Spike Lee shows off the gritty urban street crime life here perfectly. Harvey Keitel and John Turturro play homicide detectives who take the case, and the clockers are the main suspects.Clockers is a surreal look at the drug buisness, friendship, descision making, and death in the city. This movie has a flawless cast, the clockers, the detectives, and Rodney and Harold the dealers are perfect. The script is great too, as it has suprises, good dialogue, action, and setting. The direction is almost perfect, especially the last scene with the train, Spike Lee is one of the most underrated directors ever.

Spike Lee is no fool and a lot of his early work on recent viewings seem to revolve around someone stuck in a situation that is a mere result of their emotional drive and the world they are living in She's Gotta Have it; Jungle Fever and Clockers are good examples of protagonists committing an action they really shouldn't have (and probably didn't want to but buckled under either temptation or peer pressure) and now must face the consequences. But these consequences will affect more than merely the hero.Lee does not hang around in presenting or perhaps delivering his subject matter as a whole. The thing that amazes me with Lee is that he can write so many different types of characters low grade African-Americans, educated and seemingly decent African-Americans; white cops; women of different ethnicity and a few others. In Clockers, the opening scene which integrates with the credits is of a somewhat crude and humiliating public autopsy during which a couple of white cops examine a dead black man in front of a watching black crowd. Two of these detectives are Rocco Klein (Keitel) and Larry Mazilli (Turturro) but the scene acts as one final act of humiliation to an already dead black man as they search his carcase for clues and bullet holes.But the film has more than one current flowing throughout it. Strike (Phifer) plays a neighbourhood African-American who speaks and acts just like all his drug dealing friends, even hanging with them when they act out their drug selling routine to customers in a staged manner. But Strike is different and Lee wants us to create an alternate profile of the man by giving him milkshakes to drinks and trains to collect, set up in his apartment, maintain and run. The others laugh at this hobby but Strike maintains most of them too have hobbies collecting welfare cheques. But this is the greatness of a character like Strike; we are led to believe he is a bad influence through the dialogue of a police man named Andre the Giant (David) but this is perhaps just another cop's point of view and opinion on another African American kid.Andre believes Strike to be a bad influence on Tyrone (Love) but what Andre fails to notice is that there are higher, more criminal minds badly influencing Strike and that is more of a problem than Strike talking to Tyrone. The film is about a seemingly nice and somewhat moral 'gangstar' who is put in a situation where murder is the only way out, and we go through the narrative with the emphasis on this moral gangstar that he is actually a cold blooded killer in an excellent and very effective piece of atmosphere. But this is a slow burner and it slowly burns away at our opinion because there is a scene in Strike's apartment when he talks to Tyrone all about drugs and guns, apparently Tyrone should stay away from taking drugs but selling them will bring him a nice chunk of change; however guns are something that Tyrone should seriously consider getting into. To top this scene off, Tyrone is told that mathematics is also a very good thing. Already, Lee is trying to manipulate and force us to change out minds as to weather we like Strike. Is he a killer? Does he know drugs should be completely avoided? Why does he suggest Tyrone get a gun one day? Or is it just a misguided fool repeating what he once heard and saying what he thinks is right. Interesting how later on Tyrone repeats train information to another person after sort of adopting a 'Strike' figure.But the film has some more strong points. Rodney Little (Lindo) thinks that just because he has had a shotgun in the mouth and was manipulated into murder, he can do it to others. Little himself asks Strike How are you so smart and so stupid? in a scene that actually has someone echo Strike's personality to his face. Little's background in presented in a nasty and somewhat disturbing fashion via flashback to the days when he was younger with Errol Barnes (Byrd), the resident 'hood psychopath-come-criminal who seems to have some distorted views to do with religion. With all this in the melting plot, it's no wonder the film does a good job in maintain interest and quality delivery. Lee does not fail to focus on his subject matter like he does in Summer of Sam when tackling the psychological development of a serial killer and a love triangle at the same time became messy. Instead, he does not get sidetracked with any unnecessary sub-plots and keeps the delivery sharp, realistic and intriguing when the final act comes to an end.

But, as he followed, he could use what it means to have drugs in an urban environment, and what it does to the people, and have that as a stand-alone movie. He followed this up, in part, with the Samuel L. Jackson storyline in Jungle Fever, and thanks to Richard Price's novel and original script, he has here what might be his answer to that question. It's not a very great movie, perhaps, because by this time Spike Lee has so much invested in the style of his cinematic theatrics, of how the nature of the camera itself related to those of the characters, that it comes close to going over substance. But it's is a worthy attempt at putting into context, via the conventions of genre going back to the 40s, as to what makes or breaks the ties between drug dealers and their workers, and how the workers (or 'Clockers' as per the title of the movie) go about their business in the streets.Clockers has a main plot that pushes along, as the murder by multiple gun-shots of a Darryl, black fast-food worker, who was also apart of the crew of Rodney (Delroy Lindo), call into question who might have done it. At first, it seems pretty open and shut, as Victor (Isaiah Washington) comes forth and admits he did it in self-defense. Rocco Klein (Harvey Keitel) doesn't buy it, seems too easy, so he asks around, digs deeper, and sees that his brother, Strike (Mekhi Pfeifer) seems to be much more of the guilty party, by way of how he handles himself in the streets, his repore with Rodney, and as having more motive to kill Darryl. It's through this that Lee then branches it out to make it as much as character as about plot, where the ties between certain characters, like Strike and Tyrone, a pre-teen who looks up to Strike like a surrogate father, are mostly defined by how the neighborhood works out in the open. The clockers are bunch of would-be gang-bangers who talk a lot of talk, but haven't walked nearly as much as Earle, best friend of Rodney's and psychopathic murder, or Rodney himself, who has that veneer of being like the one you can trust the most- half surrogate father as well and half good cop/bad cop boss- until he gets crossed.Although Price's material, which comes through with the energy and occasional wit, is noticeable throughout, it's really Spike Lee as director and many of the actors who make this a consistently watchable movie. Lee is never one to be too subtle with the camera, and he has variations with how he deals with the material to make it very observant but also subjective. Early on, for example, we see the clockers making their deals in the park in long-shot, shaky, as if Lee's filming it far away for a reality TV show. But then we also see the 360 degree camera moves as Klein questions Strike. There's many camera moves that are practically trademark Lee shots, especially with the lighting, as Klein questions Tyrone, or when we see a flashback to Victor having to deal with some clockers. It's all very flamboyant and meant to call attention to the material, and aside from a few unneeded music choices (it's the only time you'll hear Seal in a drug dealer crime movie), he's on top of things. Meanwhile, the performances are all top-notch, usually, as Keitel and particularly Lindo play their characters so well by pretty much being how we think the actors 'really' are, even though they're not. Pfeifer has a little trickier a time with his performance, because he usually is on a very similar note I didn't do nothing, is his usual beat. His character also has the intriguing qualities that mark him as something of an outsider however in he might be his stomach virus, which is never resolved but always looming over him, and his love of electric train-sets.And all the while, Clockers succeeds in presenting a time and place where there should be little to no hope, and it makes the cops and criminals both pretty well-rounded when compared to other genre films. The cops are meant to be the good guys, but there's also a steady conflict between Klein and his partner why should Klein care so much as to who did it or why (Strike also asks this question towards the end, in one of the best scenes in the film)? And Strike and Rodney are not cut-outs from black exploitation flicks, but with more of a push and pull tie that is always a threat, never a comfort. There are little details that help make Lee's film interesting when it veers into being like a television serial; the white yuppies who get entangled in the case; the over-protective but very smart cop (Keith David, always a pro) who also tries to play surrogate father to Tyrone, albeit without the same care, however negative, as Strike has; the brief shots of the drug addicts with their habits on display, as we only need to see it for less than a minute to get the nature of the bottom of the food chain, which is total despair. Lee's film, however, isn't really disparaging as it has moments of hope, yet a hope meant to be in understanding that there's no easy way out of all of this.

So obsessed is our director with these two aspects of his film, that everything else suffers greatly and the movie is thus never able to take hold of its audience.Class actors like Harvey Keitel and John Turturro have very little to do, with everybody being mere background to lead player Phifer. While the clever plot is all but ignored, Phifer is left to carry the show from beginning to end, which he isn't quite able to do (though he puts in a solid performance).

Adisa), and Skills(Hassan Johnson) all work the benches inside the housing projects in New York City.  They are constantly being harassed by the police who often come and search them for any drugs they may have in their possession.  Strike who is getting tired and stressed out from working the benches, asks his boss Rodney(Delroy Lindo) to see if he can move up to a better position in the New York drug trade.  Rodney tells Strike the only way to do it is if he kills another clocker named Darryl Adams(Steve White) who works as the night manager at Ahab's Burger, a local restaurant.  So one night, Strike patiently waits for Darryl to come out from the Ahab's, but Strike decides to into a local bar.  Sometime later, Darryl is found dead, the victim of an apparent street crime.  This introduces us to NYPD Homicide Detectives Rocco Klein(Harvey Keitel) and Larry Mazilli(John Turturro).  When they arrive at the crime scene, they find the officers joking around as they search Darryl's bloody corspe for any evidence.  The police soon after gather enough evidence to pin the perpetrator of the crime on Strike.  Before they can arrest him though, Strike's decent and hard-working brother, Victor(Isaiah Washington) turns himself into the police as the murderer.  Rocco doesn't believe Victor's story since he doesn't believe Victor had any real reason to murder Darryl.  But he does believe however, that since Strike went bad and did have a motive to kill Darryl and Victor remained a good person, that Strike is the real murderer, but can he prove it? This is in fact Spike Lee's most underrated film, even more underrated than his epic Malcolm X.  Clockers offers an inside look into the world of black on black crime.  What's even more disturbing about Clockers is that it opens up playing Marc Dorsey's song People In Search Of A Life while showing us bloody crime scene photos.  I heard that Spike Lee said he did this for the maximum effect.  I guess that means he wanted show us the true nature of street crime and the effect it has on the community where they happen.  Mekhi Phifer makes an impressive film debut as Strike, the lead clocker.  He isn't necessarily a bad person nor is he a good person either.  His influence on Tyrone Jeeter(Pee Wee Love) a young boy whom Strike takes under his wing, is frightening, as well as it is disturbing.  Tyrone begins the same sort of transformation that Strike went through after Rodney got a hold of him.  As Strike tells Tyrone about Errol Barnes, Oh, don't think that just cuz your a kid and all, that he won't smoke you.  Why just last year I heard he caught himself a 10-year old.  A striking moment in the movie that shows street crime can happen to anyone, even kids.   Keith David gives a terrific, yet under-used performance as Andre The Giant, a local housing police officer who tries unsuccessfully to keep Tyrone from becoming like Strike.  I think one of the most over-looked performance here however is Thomas Jefferson Byrd who plays Errol Barnes, a middle-aged man who is dying of AIDS.  He is Rodney's right-hand man and is also a known child murderer.  ***SPOILERS AHEAD***  Spike Lee also creates a sort of ironic twist-of-fate for Errol towards the end of the movie.

The scenes follow each other in a certain monotony and shallowness inevitably prejudicial, and the dramatic progression is extremely weak, not to say almost non-existent. Therefore, you're never captivate by this chronicle and the overlong passages don't help either.

The intention is to shock and disturb, but Lee's photos are subject to incessant zoom-ins and close-ups of bullet wounds, all of which are distractingly manipulative. A better director would have let these photographs &#x96; which were all staged &#x96; speak for themselves. Lee, though, likes excess.Still, Clockers nevertheless finds Lee doing some of his best work. The cinematic equivalent of Ice Cube's It Was a Good Day blasting from a loudspeaker in Opposite Land, the film stars Mekhi Phifer as Strike, a Brooklyn drug dealer who's having the worse damn week of his life. As the film progresses, Strike will find himself hounded by the police, his family, other families and various high and low-level drug dealers. Epitomizing the effect of outside forces on Strike is a painful stomach ulcer which worsens as Lee's film progresses. Eventually Strike begins to bleed from the mouth and is forced to drink only magnesium hydroxide milk.Unsurprisingly, Lee sympathises dearly with Strike. His film, like its introductory photographs, is preoccupied with the physical and psychic effect of violence on black bodies. Strike is himself repeatedly hounded, symbolically raped (once by cops, once by a black gangster called Rodney), is battered by protective mothers, stomped on by housing cops and kicked-in by other street urchins until his ulcer bursts. For Lee, Strike is a criminal who is more sinned against than is sinning.Though a foul-mouthed, violent film, Lee's aesthetic exudes a certain warmth. He's in love with urban life, with Brooklyn brownstones, and his tone is often sentimental, warm and sepia-tinted, with homey interiors and loving shots of promenades and train sets. The film doesn't trivialise gang-life and the crack epidemic, but it shies away from harsher realities in favour for something more broad and melancholic. Strike is Lee's cocaine Christ, trapped in a seemingly inescapable whipping circle. The film ends with Strike on a train, curled up like an infant and hoping for rebirth.Since the release of HBO's The Wire, most crime films have been rendered obsolete. The Wire, the brainchild of David Simon, had an expansive, novelistic quality, and carefully juggled neo-realism with literary/theatrical attributes. Clockers, in contrast, sports much unconvincing dialogue, and the photogenic Mekhi Phifer is at times out of his depth. The film was written by Richard Prince, who would work with Simon on The Wire. Simon himself cites Prince's early novels as an influence on his own work. These criss-crossing influences make Lee's Clockers simultaneously ahead of its time and behind ours.7.9/10 &#x96; Worth two viewings. See Freedomland.

Staking the local park the line of work is relentlessly stressful causing a stress-induced ulcer, which he deals with by drinking down yoo-hoos by the litres. At night respite is found in the form of a trainset hobby, an voyeuristic escape from the reality he has accepted. When his boss Rodney Little (Delroy Lindo) hints towards the necessity of cropping one of his less trustworthy workers Strike confides to his brother Victor (Isaiah Washington). Soon after the murder is committed and Victor steps up to claim self defence. However hardliner detective Rocco Klein (Harvey Keitel) quickly assumes this is a cover up for the true culprit.One of Spike Lee's most accomplished works and a worryingly underrated gem bordering on a masterpiece. While showing artistic restraint in symbols and style, Spike Lee offers a well-devised structure, which lets the strength of the story carry itself. Especially in the final act Lee's well-tuned reserve makes for a heart-felt conclusion full of poignant suggestions, as to the nature of violence. Even the innocent can be corrupted needing a vent for their endless victimisation, while the corrupt seek innocence by befriending children reminiscent of them in their youth and dreaming about a life with 'no more packing'. The ultimately compassionate Rocco, previously shown as a no nonsense cop with a strong moral compass ultimately rejects 'Justice in Black and White', deciding that even the guilty are seldom dealt justice and takes on the role of a benevolent judge and jury - the antithesis of Dirty Harry and Judge Dredd, one more attuned to understand human faults, accept them, than issue warrants. Nonetheless this self-conscious style of storytelling does backlash during build-up, as the convoluted plot mires midway with mild bouts of oversentimentilisation and underwritten character motivations, before finally hitting back with an astoundingly well-rounded finale. Nonetheless a brilliant and captivating movie, which ranks up there with Spike Lee's best with high probability of future rewatching pleasure. A big part of the success comes from disposing of the preacher like stance so predominant in many of Lee's weaker works.Albeit mostly low-key and pretty standard the most significant scenes feature sudden detachment from traditional cinematography to a more detached, surreal focus, as if suggesting a detachment from the grim everyday reality of the protagonists offering escapist release from hardships. This offers some extremely imaginative cinematography by Malik Hassan Sayeed.

Clockers fails, in my opinion, because the film's premise is lacking substance to begin with; the story is lackluster to the max. On top of this, where the film had its opportunities to reel in the audience emotionally, it instead dropped the ball. Moments where energy, tension, and suspense were supposed to effused were disappointingly overridden with anticlimactic slumps in action. The choking scene in the car as well as when Mekhi is being beat up in the park, with their odd selection of music, seem unfulfilled in their potential to capitalize on emotional appeal.I will say the denouement is shot with expert precision. Lee's patented cinematographic maneuver, the double dolly, is on full display. Moreover, his use of low-key lighting in some specific scenes that illustrate the proliferation of drugs inside the projects are done in a professionally haunting manor. Unfortunately, these instances are rare, overshadowed by the weak portions previously discussed.With regards to Lee's film style in Clockers, I like to point out two of his techniques that I find terribly annoying 1) Those stupid circling gliding shots around characters when they are talking. 2) His persistent use of intense music to compliment serious(at least Lee thinks they must be) scenes. When put together, these two devices serve to create the ultimate exaggeration of the weight a scene carries in this film. Doing a flashy gliding pan across the park accompanied by pounding sound while Tyrone's mother yells at Mekhi and his boys about his haircut is a little excessive. Instead, I think Clocker's would benefit from a greater variation in the levels of stress and emotion we experience in each scene. This way, when the film actually does come to a TRULY significant moment, the audience will become more invested in the action.P.S. I don't think anyone from the projects would actually where a complete Arizona wildcats uniform. Just the jersey, not the shorts.

I know I am not the first to say this, but this movie can be compared to the novel Crime and Punishment.  Raskolnikov is Strike the young drug dealer.  Strike is always feeling nauseous due to his ulcer.  Raskolnikov was always sickly.  Harvey Keitel plays a role similar to the Police Inspector in the novel.  Who knew that Spike Lee read Russian literature.      I like the main character, Strike, because he is a train buff.  I never figured that black people in the ghettos or Projects would be train enthusiasts!  OK, so I'm a white guy.  I don't really like Rap music.  I don't really know much about the black underclass culture that exists in the ghettos and projects but I'm trying to understand.  This movie helped me learn a little bit about what life is like for these people.      Strike is tied up in a murder, just like Raskolnikov was.  Harvey Keitel likes Strike, but disdains his drug dealing.  Harvey Keitel has more sympathy for these black people than do the other white cops.  He helps coach one little black boy into saying that he killed a hoodlum in self defense so he wouldn't do hard time.  Keitel's character wants to give Strike a break, so he exiles him from New York City to keep him from facing a certain conviction with a long prison sentence.      At first I liked Delroy Lindo, because I thought that he was a simple shopkeeper, a good man trying to run a small business in a bad neighborhood.  But that's deceptive because Lindo is a distributor for drugs and has a lot of the drug dealers under his controll.  Lindo is basically a drug lord so he is not a good man!      What was sad in this movie was seeing the apartment of Strike's mother.  She was living in the Projects yet had the apartment as nicely furnished as she could manage.  I could tell that she was a good woman who worried about her family while living in a world getting worse.  What dignity!      I liked the very last scene.  Strike is sitting in the lounge car of an AmTrak train looking out the window at the desert scenery going by.  Obviously, he did leave New York and went out West to start a new life!

I'm not quite sure why Spike Lee would have chosen this presentation, though perhaps it was to create an expected emotional bond with his audience that he felt was lacking due to the large ensemble cast, or maybe he didn't trust the performances of his actors. Regardless, the overall effect cheapens the drama and removes all the real life consequence the story and characters naturally possess (as written).2 The acting comes across as preachy.Consequently, the whole film seems like it trying to prove a point (and nothing else). On the one hand, it's saying to the kids growing up in the projects that, This is no way to live. Let me show you how. And on the other, it's reaching out to the dominantly white congress, senate, electorate & bureaucracy, and trying to show these people the human cost of their ignorance, bad public policy making & flawed humanitarian ideals and voting.So the thing is, Richard Price's writing is excruciatingly realistic, and his novel, though not without its genre tropes, is equally exacting, and poignant.This film, however, feels like a very well-hearted effort to render the former, but that gets lost in way too much ideology.

It's a mixed bag on that count. Some of the weak acting is probably attributable to a lack of good direction. The strong acting comes from the experienced players like Harvey Keitel and Delroy Lindo, plus some of the supporting parts like Tom Byrd, Regina Taylor, Isaiah Washington and John Turturro. What is most unfortunate is the near complete failure of the character played by Mekhi Phifer to come across in the depth and pathos he deserves. It seems to me that this defect owes to story, script, acting and direction. They all conspire to bring the movie down on this critical dimension. We should see the character Strike much more fully and understandably in all his relationships. Instead, he just seems down-hearted most of the time. It helps that he befriends Peewee Love, but this is not enough.The story comes across as a mystery with its central character being Keitel. It is not an especially well-told mystery. It's not clear that Keitel's character was even supposed to dominate the film. But it does, because of the vacuum in Phifer's role.Spike Lee needed to decide what kind of story or genre he was working in and put it across in that genre. He didn't. Too much sentimentality comes in. The story is too episodic. It becomes a semi-documentary of ghetto life and relationships without coherence. It is extremely difficult to provide a coherent story while having all sorts of asides, unless they are subplots that tie into the main plot. And when the film attempts to do that, it does so in a very obscure way.I like the film for its positives, but it really is a bit of a mess. We should be understanding the characters and their motivations far better than we are given to do. Told properly, this would have been a great story and movie. I don't think Richard Price, who wrote the book, succeeded in translating it into a powerful screenplay.

Later that night, I viewed it in a large cineplex with possibly 20-25 screens. There were other action films, comedies, and dramas that I could have chosen from, but I had to see Lee's latest outing. He was a controversial director back then and still reins as one today. In the 90's, his films were a bit more mainstream than they are now. To me, they were like events. And after watching the trailer for Clockers, I knew I had to get to a viewing on opening night. Slightly disjointed, messy at times, yet totally absorbing, Clockers remains one of Spike Lee's most interesting and most forceful cinematic feats. It holds a varied cast of actors known and unknown (I'm just speculating but I think a lot of the people on screen were plucked off the street without any acting experience thus adding to the film's realism), a plethora of varied styles of directing, a fantastic opening credit sequence, and a massive need to get its message across. With most of Spike's films, you generally see a sort of sporadic narrative. Clockers has this but it still manages to be a solid helping from the Brooklyn- rooted director. Produced by legendary filmmaker Martin Scorsese and based on a novel of the same name by Richard Price (he wrote the screenplay as well), Clockers tells the story of a small-time drug dealer named Ronald Strike Dunham (played by Mekhi Phifer who at the time, had never acted in a film before and got picked out of 1,000 people in an open casting call). He works with a bunch of other fellow dealers who are labeled Clockers (they are basically 24 hour drug pushers). When Strike's brother Victor Dunham (played by Isaiah Washington) is accused and confesses (in self defense) to murdering one of Strike's rival dealers working at a fast food restaurant, Strike is then somehow caught up in the whole investigation. He's pulled in different directions and has to take sides. This is based on his relentless pursuers being a morally concerned cop named Rocco Klein (played by Harvey Keitel who gives a Harvey Keitel-like performance) and a parasitic drug lord named Rodney Little (Oscar caliber stuff from Delroy Lindo). A couple of things to note about this film the acting by the entire cast down to the bit players, the supporting players, and the leads is sensational in every way. Second the drug solicitation scenes that are featured at various intervals are disturbingly real and authentic. As you view them, it feels less like you're watching a movie and more like you're experiencing real life as it happens. Registering at a running time of just over 2 hours, it's safe to say that there is a lot of movie to take in with Clockers. This vehicle is a character study, a drug flick, and a murder mystery all in one. You have a meaty script by Richard Price (he wrote The Color of Money and Ransom), a searing musical score from Terrence Blanchard (he's Lee's right hand man when it comes to musical scores), and an extremely dark- hued look from cinematographer Malik Hassan Sayeed. In essence, Spike Lee has every resource possible to flex his directorial wings. This is in my mind, one of the strongest turns he has ever put in as a director. His technique is exuberant. You get a lot of slow motion scenes (set to music of course), a shot that pans over the view of one of the film's most pivotal moments (a protective murder of a burnt out drug addict by a young boy), some solid jump cuts (at the beginning during one of the drug deals), and high energy flashbacks that are quick and to the point. A lot of the film's best sequences are not only set to Blanchard's score, but also to a mixed pop soundtrack with songs from Seal, Crooklyn Dodgers, Chaka Khan, and Rebelz of Authority.In conclusion, this is a heavy urban crime drama with powerfully realized, individual scenes. Clockers is no doubt, a solid interpretation of Lee's rather large body of work. He tries hard to be a good storyteller and sometimes slips a bit. But somehow someway, he still gets the job done here. The film's last ten minutes, which feel subdued, project a bit of a relief from all the chaos that came before it. They faithfully channel a feeling of radiant hope. This reassures the viewer that an exercise this depressing and melodic, can still end on a positive note. With that said, Clockers for me, was definitely worth a re-viewing. It's a Spike Lee Joint that clocks in as something I would wholeheartedly recommend.

The obvious answer is that Lee is able to provide an authenticity that Scorsese may not have. While it is not true that only black men can tell the stories of other black men, but few handle the material like Lee does. Scorsese would likely have shifted the emphasis to Rocco Klein, the white cop.And that would have worked, as well. Klein (played by Harvey Keitel) is the co-protagonist, as his search for the killer is an important plot point. Roger Ebert says, He is a weary professional who acts as a witness to death. There is a tendency in his business not to linger too long over the death of one young drug dealer, but he cannot get stubborn questions out of his mind. Keitel does a fine job in this role, and it is nice to see him take his gritty gangster image and put a spin on it towards law enforcement.

A clocker is a term for a drug dealers, who works furtively, under the table. We all know em', we all seen em', though I'm sounding more Americanized there. A young clocker has been shot, and may'be the wrong brother has been imprisoned. Again, enter trimly dressed, cool Keitel, a cop, again with a heart, who knows deep in his own heart it's the younger brother, Strike (Mekhi Pfeiffer) a clocker. The one who's been imprisoned is a Mr Do Right, holds a steady job, and is ever so polite to his customers, while also being a good mediator if the brother play up in his café. Keitel, on a unrelenting quest, keeps haranguing Pfeifer, breaking him down, until the surprising finale, where the real truth comes out, where it's like a big joke has been played on us, all along. Clockers is compulsive viewing, all the way, about reality, of growing in the disadvantaged New York Projects, where we hope in the end, Strike, will finally get out of all this bull...t and finally getting his life on track. The over confronting, bloody opening shots, is from real footage of black victims, as the opening credits comes randomly sliding across the screen. Even this sequence impressed me.

And if you think that you've been desensitized enough by police procedural and gangster movies, Clockers will be a powerful wake-up call. Honestly, I can't recall a film that dealt so straightforwardly with real-life violence apart from David Cronenberg's A History of Violence but that was 10 years after ''Clockers.The opening credits set the tone. Shots of young black persons' murdered are shown, blood staining the pavement and deadpan expression proving they didn't see what was coming to them. Lee doesn't stylize for aesthetic purposes but intelligently guide our expectations, loudly shouting what gangster films timidly whispers this is an ugly word with no redeeming appeal whatsoever. No matter what it involves, it either ends up with jail of being the unintentional poser of bloody aftermaths' pictures. And their purpose is echoed in the murder scene, where lies Darryl Adams, a restaurant manager, shot four times.The sight of the body is disturbing but no more than the total detachment of the two assigned detectives played by Harvey Keitel and John Turturro. They comment the body with shocking detachment and cynical wisecracks such as the kid had brains while blood spilled over a hole in his head&#x85; I don't think Lee's intent is to portray these cops as racist or cynical, but to underline how routinely these murders became. This is not to brandish the 'racism' flag (Lee is above these clichés) but to remind us that these crimes are committed within the black community. So, no matter what you'd think of the cops, they're not the ones who pulled the trigger.We're used of that ambiguity regarding racism and this is a credit to Spike Lee's co-writing with Richard Price, who wrote the original novel. Clockers depicts a slice of people's life that encapsulates all the factors that lead to the opening 'pictures'. And that no-way-out situation is embodied by the main protagonist, Strike (Mekhi Phifer), a clocker working for Rodney (Delroy Lindo), the crime lord of the neighborhood. His job mainly consists on standing in the park and waiting for customers coming to buy crack. The process is well-elaborated, as there is a watcher to check for cop's arrivals, but eventual strip-searches are also part of this routine.The point is that clockers are at the bottom of the hierarchy, but that's their way of living. The issue of money is another layer of subtlety the film provides. Strike doesn't use money to date girls, buy a car or new clothes. Electric trains are his hobbies. Why? Why not? But we understand that he's trapped in that job for the simple reason is that it earns him enough money to fulfill his passion. On the other hand, his brother Victor (Isaiah Washington) is a honest, two-job worker and decent father forced to constantly swallow the bitter taste of frustration while watching brothers making easy money while he gets no respect and that's his routine.These brothers live in a world where money buys enough power to ooze respect. Both feel pressure in their lives, and the result is Victor's arrest and confession that he murdered Adams, claiming it was for self-defense, but there's something wrong in that murder Keitel's character can't get off his head. The case is even more complex because it was Strike who was supposed to kill Adams, to make his bones with Rodney and climb the 'social ladder'. The seemingly fatherly affection between Rodney and Strike is finally distorted when Rodney reveals the first time he killed a man, threatened with a gun on his mouth by Errol (Thomas Jefferson Byrd) a tough killer before he became the local AIDS-stricken psycho.Like for Rodney, Strike had to have blood on his hands, the point of no-return meaning trust. So, we get it, there are no feelings in such a dirty business. And as the investigation proceeds, Keitel gets more and more interested in Strike's case and wonder why he'd let his brother covering him, and why would a man like Victor kill Adams in the first place? To spare Strike the burden of belonging to Rodney, and in the process, vent all his anger? The procedural leaves to a satisfying resolution but it wasn't Clockers' main point. The film is more about complex human interactions, because while Keitel and Phifer get closer one another, their mutual affection feel more real and genuine than with Rodney, and might pave the road to Strike's redemption.I know this 'redemption' word is kind of hackneyed, but I know Scorsese co-produced the film, and I felt some intense Scorsesian vibes in that gritty depiction of an underworld and the torment poisoning the main character's life, in the real meaning of the world since Strike is also victim of chronicle ulcer that gets bloodier as the film progresses, like a metaphor of his moral downfall and an imminent deadly conclusion. But there's a third significant character to enrich the film Tyrone, a kid who admires Strike and imitates him to the point of shaving his head and wearing the same clothes. The kid is a younger version of Strike with Strike playing Rodney's mentor role, and ironically, the disciple shows more zeal and competence than his master. Tyrone's arc is a light of hope illuminating possible ways out of the hell&#x85; given you don't act like people acted with you.Tyrone evolves from the embodiment of Strike's disgrace to his redemption. And Strike is given the same chance, the possibility to count on people who don't help him because they like him, but because they hate that world enough to triumph over it by getting someone out of it. Indeed, there might be a right way and a wrong way but when trapped in such blinding routine, everybody needs a sign, or guidance.

I never felt involved with any of the characters in it or to any of the dramatic events and developments. It doesn't make this movie bad but it does indeed make this movie a bit of a one dimensional experience.And remember, this is an 1995 movie. So everything that was considered to be hip and 'thug life' might seem a bit ridicules and less cool in today's perspective. The whole attitude and way of talking and the way everyone dresses makes this movie really a product of its time. In that regard this movie also really reminded me of Kids, which coincidentally or not, got made in the same year as this movie. It makes this movie less relevant to watch now days but really, it's nothing I was holding against the movie.I would had most definitely preferred it if this movie was using a more straightforward style of storytelling. The movie as it is seems to be wanting to focus on far too many different characters and tries to do and tell too much. It also really has its own style to it, when it comes down to its storytelling, which was nice and helped to give this movie an unique feeling but at the same time it also made the movie unnecessary hard and not all that pleasant to follow at times.Another thing I also disliked about this movie was its pick of music. The movie mad some bad music choices, in which the music often would swell and become melodramatic at moments that really were uncalled for. It absolutely distracted and most of the time didn't suit what was happening on the screen at the time.But really, I though this movie still had some hints of a great movie in it as well. One thing was its already earlier mentioned unique and distinctive style. Spike Lee always has had an unique and distinctive style of his own and he manages to put a lot of that in this movie successfully. There are some interesting moments in this movie, from a more technical and movie-making perspective. There was some good camera-work for instance and also very little wrong with the movie its editing and pacing.The movie its story in essence also really seemed to be a solid one but I do feel that they perhaps should had picked some different perspectives to keep- and make things a bit more interesting and effective. Wouldn't this movie for instance had been better and more interesting if it told things more from the Harvey Keitel's character perspective? Who knows and it's not like the movie bad or interesting as it is right now but while watching this movie it constantly gave me the feeling it had more potential and things could had been done better.I don't know, perhaps the movie was also being a bit stuck between being a gangster movie and a more realistic one. It never felt like a true gangster flick and it never felt like a true realistic movie neither. Producer Martin Scorsese perhaps should had stepped in a bit more often, since he definitely is a kind of director who can more successfully blend realism with tough and tense gangster/crime movies.Not trying to sound too negative. The movie is good enough as it is but it doesn't ever reaches its full potential.7/10 http//bobafett1138.blogspot.com/ "},{"Title":"Brothers killin' other brothers ain't no big thing.

It stars Harvey Keitel, John Turturro, Delroy Lindo, Mekhi Phifer, Isaiah Washington, Keith David, Peewee Love and Regina Taylor. Music is scored by Terence Blanchard and cinematography by Malik Hassan Sayeed.Young drug pushers in the projects of Brooklyn (Clockers) are caught between loyalty to their drug boss and the detectives out to stop them.It's not as incendiary as one might expect of a Spike Lee joint, but the director's concerns and astute knack for story telling are very prominent features. It was originally going to be a Martin Scorses film, but he chose to make Casino instead, he does, however, get a producing credit and you can see in the material why Scorsese was interested in directing. Pic is basically a take on urban drug dealing in the Brooklyn projects and the impact said dealing has on anyone who comes into contact with it. From the downward spiral of life for young men earning their pay by illegal means, to fretful mothers desperately trying to keep pe-teen kiddies from joining the ranks of what they think are cool operators, the morality of the play is forcibly rammed home by Lee. Unfortunately this comes at a cost to the white cop characters, who are too thinly drawn to offer up a law and order counter point to the illegal activity involving drugs and murder, they serve only as the man, and damn the man at that. The Rocco Klein (Keitel) of the book is not evident here, sadly, while Torturo may as well not be in it! Cast performances are well in tune with the material, with Lindo as the black godfather turning in a scary one, and Lee's camera-work, coupled with Sayeed's moody photography, has a nifty grasp of realism. Soundtracking is soulful and pleasant.A mixed bag for sure, but it's a story that needs to be told. Bleak and brutal at times, but still offering hope, it's middle tier Spike Lee that always remains intriguing. Even if it at times feels like he was bored telling yet another black on black is bad message movie. 7/10 "},{"Title":"Tribal Study.","Date":"5 May 2012","Score":"","Genre":"Crime, Drama, Mystery","Review":" In this complicated tale of the pressures on Mekhi Phifer in the Brooklyn projects, director Spike Lee captures the values and the iconography of the African-American community well, as he usually does. You get a genuine sense of the simmering anger, the shifting allegiances, and the small reward system of the social world these pathetic people live in.Pfifer is the central figure and he sweats a lot. No brighter or better than he should be, he's pressured from one side into dealing cocaine by local mogul Delroy Lindo. On the other side, he's pushed by the manipulative but well-intentioned detectives Harvey Keitel and Stanley Turturro. Pfifer's handsome and upright brother is under arrest for murder but Keitel believes that Pfifer is the culprit. Pfifer's brother is simply too good, too compliant, to have done the deed.Nice ambiguity. Lee convincingly nails the diversity and solidarity of the community. It's like John Ford in the ghetto. Pfifer may be innocent of the crime of which Keitel is convinced he's guilty but he also deals dope. Keitel, for all his ploying the system, is determined to bring the guilty party to justice, though he may play a little dirty in getting the job done. And when he finds out that he's been wrong about who committed the murder, he does what such a person would do in real life. He hides his guilt behind a tirade of threats.In a way, it's an improvement over Spike Lee's Do The Right Thing. It doesn't turn all the cops into heavies. And it doesn't end with an ominous quote from Malcolm X.The weakness of the film lies in Lee's allowing conversations to go on for too long. Pfifer gets a lot of screen time and when he's not chewing out his young brother (who will save his life) he's whining about his innocence. The exchanges, sometimes rising to shouts, go on too long and become tiring.It's a devalued life these people lead. They wear clothes and they groom themselves in ways that appeal only to those in their immediate and limited social worlds. I'm beginning to develop an idea. The more you resemble someone who is upper class and British, the more your social worth. The farther removed you are from this model, the lower your status. If you could take Pfifer, dress him in riding clothes and teach him to play polo, and have him say eck-tually instead of aks, and have him grow some hair on his shaved and shiny skull, he might not be thought guilty of anything except being too polite.

I've always been vaguely aware of it's existence as one of the 'other' Spike Lee films, but not much more. I certainly wasn't expecting to see some of his all-time best work, which it is. This film should be mandatory viewing for every single high school in America, that's how important it is. Spike Lee paints a devastatingly realistic picture of inner-city life and the mortal perils that it's inhabitants face on a daily basis. There are no heroes, no angels, and no caricatures. It's all laid bare for the viewer to draw their own conclusion. Lee treats the audience with a level of respect and maturity that is almost unheard of in films that deal in such explosive and controversial subject matter. He trusts that the audience will understand the big picture and take away the appropriate lesson without being evangelized, and without resorting to the kind of cheap gimmickry and pandering that can often plague films of this genre. Everyone should see this film. Literally everyone.

Inside Man was a wonderful mature film that focused on character and motivation far beyond the Afro-centric purview of earlier Spike films. And while Clockers is perfectly serviceable for anyone coming to the story without having read the novel, I submit that Spike's attempt to refocus Richard Price's 1992 masterpiece as a singular black story, with a bone-throwing portrayal of white Detective Rocco Klein within an indictment of white police tactics, short-changes the audience of the profound respect, balance and humanity that made Price's novel so unforgettable.It is truly one of the five best novels I have ever read, while Spike managed to produce one of 1000 best movies I have ever seen.Read the book.

Clockers is about Strike, a young black man living in Brooklyn, dealing drugs for his ruthless drug lord Rodney Little. Strike deals drugs for the money, but all he really wants to do is hang out with his brothers in the park and play with model train sets. But things start to get rough when a night manager at a local fast food joint is murdered and Strike's brother Victor turns himself in. Det. Rocco Klein is the lead detective on the case and he doesn't buy Victor's story, which sets him on an obsessive hunt to unmask the truth behind this whole ordeal. The film is loaded with spirited yet vulgar dialouge, artistic and vibrant direction, and plenty of memorable characters. Clockers is witty, intelligent, and a lot of fun. It isn't your typical murder mystery or racial tension film. It is a beautiful blend of the two genres that turns into something very unique and very exciting.Spike Lee adds a lot of visual flair to this film and the way he directs it is something you can't quite pinpoint. The panoramic visual style is something you can't exactly describe in words and it is really something you have to see for yourself. There is something obviously unique going on in the way Lee directs this film, it is just difficult to articulate what exactly that is. But the visuals do work in a whole plethora of unique films, allowing the film to succeed on multiple levels. The film ranges from intense and gripping to quirky and fun. From one scene to the next the film grows more fun and more enthralling. Rarely do I care this much about what happens to the characters of a film and I'm not always so compelled to learn the motivations of the very well written characters of a film.All that being said I can't say that I loved the main character, Strike. The actor, Mekhi Phifer, wasn't great and the character himself had some odd moments. I eventually learned to like him and his character thankfully didn't deter too much from my liking of the film. Besides, a lot of the film actually focuses on Harvey Keitel's character and his unending search for the truth behind the murder. There are also numerous subplots that all end up being more interesting than the main character's story. It helps that this is just an all around well written film that is just smarter than your average crime film.Clockers is very different from any murder mystery crime film, as well as any racial tension film. But it provides plenty of great work on both sides of this spectrum. Spike Lee has created a visually interesting film with a fantastic story. The main character is the only low point of the film, but everything else is very good. Clockers is a very worthwhile watch for fans of Spike Lee or the multiple genres this film spans. "},{"Title":"Modern urban classic - Spike's greatest 'joint'","Date":"24 March 2011","Score":"","Genre":"Crime, Drama, Mystery","Review":" This is one of my all-time favourite films. Director Spike Lee adapts the Richard Price Novel, set in New Jersey, to his hometown and favourite movie backdrop Brooklyn. It is often said that films never live up to the books on which they are based, but in this case I think the movie out performs the novel. This is because the book can be slow moving at times, and the action is separated by long passages of writing. However, the film chops all of these slow parts out, and the result is a film that keeps you engaged from start to finish. Spike Lee uses music perfectly to compliment the tone and mood of each scene, be it hip-hop in the urban playground, the acoustic interludes of Seal and Des'ree, or minor key, intense jazz to accompany drug use in doorways and nooks, and the final scene's soundtrack is absolutely inspired.Delroy Lindo plays his king-pin character with such comfort, at times it is hard to imagine that he isn't that person in reality! Harvey Keitel and John Turturro work well as the detective double-team, conflicting over whether to take the easy close-by-arrest, or the moral crusade to find the truth behind the case at the heart of the film. Mekhi Phifer is impressive in many of his scenes as the central character, who keeps you guessing to the end on whether he deserves your sympathy or not. For me, Lindo's performance is the standout turn.The cinematography is luscious, and the colours and compositions make this film a visual feast. But more importantly, the natural dialogue of the film and the delivery of nearly every line really reinforce the fact that you are watching a film about real situations. Overall, I give this film my maximum rating of 9.5 stars. If you like this film, you'll love The Wire Season One, and you also might want to check out another overlooked film, Jason's Lyric.

Although centring on Strike one of the eponymous Clockers the film examines the ravages of drugs from a cross-section of society. Mothers, brothers, policemen, children and corner boys are all given their say. The script is careful to portray no one as entirely evil, with even the chameleon Rodney given a chance to present his own case for victim status.The entire cast give committed performances, particularly a standout turn by Isaah Washington's humblingly decent Victor. Mekhi Phifer's conflicted Strike is also utterly watchable as he meanders from disaster to disaster, trapped between his so called friends, employers and the police.Spike Lee's direction is on point as ever and although the ghetto is never beautiful, Lee's cinematography makes sure that it is always interesting. Lee uses colour and a wide variety of shots to texture the story he is trying to tell. Whether it is the brash reds and oranges of the mountains and countryside to emphasize Strike's escape from the greyness of the ghetto, or Lee's trademark floating head shot, the film never lets up in its innovation.Clockers is a classic Spike Lee Joint, imprinting itself on to the viewers' consciousness long after the end credits roll. An important work on an important subject.

Having developed a bleeding ulcer from using crack and drinking this ghetto drink called Moo Strike knows that he'll never live to see his twentieth birthday. That's unless he disassociates himself from his fellow crack dealers, called clockers, and the person they work for local barber and neighborhood drug lord Rodney Little, Delory Lindo.It's when Little takes Strike under his wing and tells him that he'll go places in the world by becoming a big time drug dealer like himself, not a bottom feeding 24 hour pusher, that thing turn around for Strike and for the worst! Told by Little that the night manager Darryl Adams, Steve White, of the fast food joint Ahab has been dealing crack out of his eating establishment without kicking any of his profits back to him Strike is given his big chance to knock Adams off and take over his business.Even tough Strike is willing to sell crack and pay the price for it, by constantly being arrested and shaken down by the police, he's a bit scared to murder anyone in order to ingratiate himself with his boss, who treats Strike like his own son, Rodney Little! It's when Strike meets his older brother Victor, Isaiah Washington,in the local ginmill that he comes up with the idea to get Victor to do the job, icing Darryl Adams,himself!Shockingly brutal and honestly realistic movie filmed mostly around the high crime Gowanus-called the Nelson Mendela in the film-Hoseing Projects in the Red Hook section of Brooklyn New York. The film makes you realize how hard it is for young people like Strike to have a normal childhood where their never given, by the dangerous environment that they find themselves in, a chance to have one. The poverty together with the knowledge of knowing that crime is about to only way to survive in neighborhoods like Red Hook in Brooklyn can turn anyone, no matter how hard they try not to, into either a person like a Strike or Rodney Little. Later in the film when Darryl is blasted to bits by an unknown gunman It's Victor, who runs the rival eating establishment Hambo's who turned himself in as Darryl's killer. The cop handling the case of Darryl Adam's murder Det. Rocco Kline, Harvey Keitel, is very sure that Victor a hard working and law abiding, as well as good family man, citizen is covering up the fact that it was his always in trouble with the law younger brother Strike who was Darryl's actually killer.Not leaving any stone unturned Det. Kline get's Strike's handler and drug supplier Rodney Little to suspect that he ratted him out to the cops in supplying himself and his fellow clockers with crack. This has the honest Strike, who didn't finger his boss Rodney Little,to become a marked man in the neighborhood with Little, now out for revenge, putting a price on his head. Even though Det. Kline put Strike's life in danger he in fact saved him from a fate much worse. This had Strike, with Det. Kline's help, leave the city of New York and start a new life, where no one knows him, in far off Albuquerque New Mexico doing what he loves best Learning to become a motorman on a freight train going cross country!****SPOILER***** As for who killed Darryl Adams that becomes evident late in the movie in a long and bloody flashback in how rumors can lead to murder if the person spreading them doesn't care whom, the person who's killed or the one who kills him, he ends up screwing! Even his own flesh & blood!Director Spike Lee's shocking depiction of life on the mean streets of Red Hook & Ft. Green Brooklyn is about as realistic as any movie made on the subject of inner city life n America. Even though the movie is about the most despicable persons you'll, God forbid, ever run into it also shows how their just as much a victim of crime as those that they pray on. Strike soon sees the light in his trying to get 12 year-old Shorty Jeeter, Peewee Love,to follow in his footsteps as a clocker or crack pusher.It's when Strike changed his mind and tried to straighten Shorty, who looked up to Strike as a role model, out that things got in fact worse not better for the two of them. Even though they had to bend the law a little both Det. Kline and local, from the Mendela Housing Projects, NYPD cop Andre The Giant, Keith David, got both Strike and Shorty a new start in life away from the horrors that they faced everyday in the ghetto with them and only them, in taking advantage of it, able to make that new start in life work.

Strike's desire is further complicated when the local kingpin (Delroy Lindo) he works for gives him the task of killing another one of his own dealers who turns up dead soon after. Now Det. Rocco (Harvey Keitel) is adamant in finding out who killed the drug dealer. His veteran detective's intuition points him at Strike as the shooter.Strike's brother Victor (Isiah Washington), a hardworking, God fearing, law abiding husband and father of two, confesses to the murder, which seems like a ploy to get Strike off the hook to Rocco and his intuition.During Rocco's persistent scrutiny of Strike, there is an engaging subplot that shows Strike trying to be a big brother to a fatherless young boy in his projects, a boy that obviously admires the conflicted drug dealer. On the other hand, the boy's mother doesn't share her son's admiration for Strike while Andre the Giant (Keith David), once a mentor to Strike, threatens him to stay away from the young boy as well.However, Rocco's dogged determination to catch Strike spirals the investigation way out of control, to the point of no return.I thoroughly enjoyed this film. I cringed at the colorful clothes wore by the young Brooklyn boys, but that was a minor flaw overshadowed by the complex characters, riveting performances and the interesting plot. Strike's seamless character arc was a difficult journey. Everyone seems to end up in a win/lose situation that doesn't give us any answers to the drug problem in urban America or a solution for urbanites' damaging glorification of gun violence.The drug dealing scenes were excellent. Spike Lee either used real crack addicts for these scenes or the greatest actors ever that can play crack addicts flawlessly.The ending could be perceived as anticlimactic but it all works well for a satisfying, motion picture experience.I was unimpressed by the camera-work and the cinematography, particularly the reversal film look of the movie. The cinematographer should have kept the look clean instead of grainy.The performances weren't without flaws, with some that seemed over-the-top (Spike Lee's style) or muted, like the young boy that idolized Strike.However, Mekhi Phifer, making his motion picture debut, was like a tour de force, bringing the New York City street attitude and slang to the big screen rarely seen in film and television while leaving out the trained thespian, unauthentic feel that undermines any actor's portrayal of street kids from the N.Y.C. Keitel, Turturro, David and Lindo were all excellent, rounding out the supporting cast.This is a great film if you're looking for something urban and gritty, driven by a murder mystery against the backdrop of 1990's Brooklyn, before the gentrification. It's definitely one of Spike Lee's top five best films in my humble opinion.

Its a detective and small time crooks story but its also got more. The story itself, based on a Richard Price novel, Clockers, is a raw portrayal of young drug dealers, aka clockers, caught in the cyclical grit of the New York streets with little hope of escaping this life. One of these young clockers is killed and a detective tries to get down to the facts. His two main suspects are brothers one is a clocker, the other is trying to make it by being legit. Thats the basic story. And it works.What else works is Spike's depiction of the desperation and workings of the cycle of drug dealing and how it is passed down from old to young - the mechanism of ghetto life is fueled and kept going by its inner workings. A kid is obsessed with a gangster video game, similar to GTA. Other kids are more interested in looking hip then making something of themselves - all typical things in ghetto life - to give the idea of prestige via bling bling, clothes and such. Characters in the film, Rodney, Spike, Shorty, all want or wanted to get involved in the street happenings to gain maybe notoriety or credit or a sense of importance and in the end they must pay for this.My problems with the film are these At times the film gets instructional. For instance there are a few monologues that preach the negative effects of crack as if the film is a public service announcement to all the crack users. Another monologue, the one in the barber shop about buying useless things could be more subtle instead of some blatant anti consumerist agenda speech. Its clear Spike feels strongly about these issues and in general the hopelessness of ghetto life. But too often I got the feeling he's trying to talk you out of it, rather than simply objectively show it. And this was my problem with this. Its got moral message that might as well have been preceded with 5 seconds of black frame with white letters saying, this is the message of the film so listen carefully. In this case, all those writing and film teachers who told me many times over to show and not tell, I now noticed were hitting on something important, something Spike should have taken into account. Otherwise, why not he start making commercial service announcements about social issues and state propositions which so and so political figure is fighting to change for the better.Or maybe the reason I give it a seven out of ten has something to do with the eyeball reflection shot where Detective (Kietel) is seen reflected, as if stuck in the eyeball of the suspected killer. Does this mean he is innocent? Or is it all subjective? You decide.

A sad tale of urban life and the continuous cycle of crime and poverty in inner cities, where only the lead character Strike gets a break in his life.The film is masterfully written and directed and as the plot unravels it takes the viewer with it on a who done it tale based within The Projects of New York.The majority of the characters are unsympathetic, not people trying to change the world around them, merely props in the cycle of crime. Take for example the two homicide cops played masterfully by Harvey Keitel and John Turturro investigating the murder that links the main characters. They are anything but hero's who are indifferent or de-sensitised to the crimes they deal with this is summed up by the quote just another stain on the side walk said at the crime scene of the main murder.Although the film focuses on the local drug trade based around the park and the projects and run by the youths, it is Delroy Lindo's horrible Rodney character who masterminds it all from a distance and ensues that the cycle of crime continues. Grooming kids from an early age, acting as a father figure to these poor youngsters and promising them the world in exchange for them clocking. This man really is Satan in disguise, fully aware of what he is doing, corrupting children for his own benefit and yet appearing as a Saint.An all round excellent film. "}{"Title":"Good Acting, Mediocre Directing","Date":"11 August 2004","Score":"","Genre":"Crime, Drama, Mystery","Review":"  I usually like Spike Lee films, but with Scorsese, one of the greatest movie directors of all time working beside him, the directing could have been much better. I liked this film mainly because I liked the book. The acting is very good, especially Harvey Keitel, Mekhi Phifer, Delroy Lindo, and Keith David but several details from the book were missing.The book and movie are very similar, you get a sense right away when reading the book that Harvey Keitel is Detective Klein. You get a feeling that Rodney can be played by Samuel L. Jackson, but Delroy Lindo who is known for playing a gangster performs very well. You also sense Mekhi Phifer as Strike. The main differences are that all of Strike's crew have different names and they deal more with some other gangs in town. There is a shootout against a Puerto Rican crew which is completely ignored in the movie. Also the whole concept of playing with Trains is something completely new. However I think Spike Lee did well in using the trains to portray Strike's humanity a little bit better. The book does a much better job describing Strike's frustrations and resentment over his life and his current position in life. Finally the book takes place in New Jersey while the movie takes place in Brooklyn. I feel this move was actually good it not only gave the audience a more familiar setting but because Scorsese and Lee both are much better adept to Brooklyn than many of directors.On to what was done right. First and foremost Harvey Keitel pulled off a performance as Detective Rocco Klein that no other actor could have pulled off. You get a sense the whole time that it's an easy natural role for him. Pulp Fiction was an act for him, Clockers was not. He seemed to do very well throughout the film, especially the parts where he is pressing Strike for information. John Turtorro does a good job as Rocco's partner Mazilli. After seeing him in other Spike Lee movies, it is almost no surprise to me that he would fall into the role of Mazilli. One performance that I thought was done really well was Keith David's role as Andre The Giant. He played a community-oriented Black Police Officer who was one of the few cops out there that really cared for this particular Black Community. Spike Lee directs most of the White Cops as he does in all of his movies, for the most part not giving one damn either way about Black People. His portrayal of Andre was critical mainly because the audience needed a sense that Cops were actually interested in helping the community. Andre is the type of Cop every Black Community wants. He is caring, supportive, unabusive, protective, and tough on the real criminals. He is the only officer who can successfully date one of the kid's moms (Tyrone's mom) and not even have the drug dealers view her is traitor. In the book, Andre is much bigger so I thought at first someone like Ving Rhames or Michael Clarke Duncan would play Andre based on size, but Keith David was a much better actor to play this particular role. This movie was a perfect way for Mekhi Phifer to begin acting. This role defines him through many of his other movies and there was no better place for him to start out than in a ghetto drama such as this. Delroy Lindo gave the second best performance of the movie. Seeing Malcolm X; Blood In, Blood Out; and Romeo must die, I knew he'd be perfect for the role of Rodney. Like Keitel, he seems really natural at his role especially when he gives Strike the speech about what Crack Cocaine will do to someone. His whole attitude as Rodney is perfect being an uncaring, relentless, intelligent drug dealer who ran this particular set of projects. Isaiah Washington did well as Victor but I think he wasn't the only one who could have played Victor. He was believable as a working class citizen trying to leave the projects but he didn't stick out naturally like Keitel or Lindo. Michael Imperioli (Chris from The Sopranos) had a nice contribution to the movie too playing the crooked Detective JoJo. I couldn't stop laughing when he told the kids from Connecticut about 12 baboons in a cage calling you Mary all night long for refusing to give up the drugs they came to buy. He was a little foul mouthed at times and insensitive like in his speech about Dinkins being out and Guiliani being in, but he contributed a nice minor performance. Overall the acting was very good and too natural for some of the people performing.Overall, I liked the story because it is a true description over the crack dealing that goes on in inner city America. I think the movie could have easily been an hour longer but in the condensed time frame, it did what it could. I think it was good for Lee to display people who dealt drugs only to go somewhere better in life and to display the damage that crack does to people. Unlike Do The Right Thing and Jungle Fever, I think Lee did a better, more realistic display of the relationship between the Police and the Black Community during this day and age. In those two movies he shows two stereotypical White Italian Cops who actually play the same role in each movie (Rick Aiello and Miguel Sandoval as Officers Long and Ponte) who are quick to beat up and slow to control themselves against Alleged Black Criminals who get treatment worse than they deserved (Flipper Purify gets a gun to his head for friendly roughhousing and Radio Raheem gets purposefully strangled to death). In this movie, he shows a Black Cop who cares, some White Cops who are beat out by what goes on in violent neighborhoods and who start to care when someone they think is innocent is going to be sent to jail. I do think the added line by Mekhi Phifer about cops not caring over Black on Black violence was needed because it is the way that most of Black America really feels about Policing. Overall it was well acted but poorly directed for the quality of actors and directors in the film, 7/10.

Like his contemporary, Michael Moore, his virtuosity as a director is often lost in passionate reaction to his political reputation. Like Akira Kurasawa, his brilliance in a different genre is ignored in favour of his dominant image - Kurosawa as a Samurai filmmaker, Lee as a Black American filmmaker. Both made films among the best, I think in the American cop genre - for Kurosawa it is High and Low and 2 other early films based on police novels of Ed McBain. I have published some scholarly criminology research, and what blew me away in Clockers was the rich, accurate, impartial detail that explained what was happening on the street and why people acted as they did, in a moving, gripping entertaining way. A seemingly baffling and maybe still unsolved murder in San Francisco in the past 5 years fit neatly into a pattern we learn about in the film, so the film succeeds in making an unfamiliar world understandable.

He seemed to have a maddening lack of interest in anything but his toy trains and his ulcer.  He was so passive that I couldn't believe that I was supposed to care much how he ended up.  I see the point that's made with his character - that he's young man trying to establish himself in a world already dominated by the power of the drug economy, Rodney Little and the NYPD - but his lack of interest in his brother's fate was offputting.Aside from the exasperation I felt watching Strike shrug about everything, the movie is packed with really intelligent performances and is beautifully shot and scored.  Thomas Jefferson Byrd and Delroy Lindo deliver menace, authority and convey the ruthless intelligence of people who have been running a dangerous game for several decades.  Lindo is especially amazing in the scenes where he cynically harvests his young drug pushers by becoming a magnanimous father figure, dispensing largesse, love and responsibility.  Harvey Keitel and John Turturro don't do anything they haven't done in other films.  Isaiah Washington's character, Victor, really gets put through the grinder in this movie and Washington makes his suffering real enough that I couldn't guess if or why he murdered the fast food clerk.

The film becomes a whodunit in the middle of the ghetto. Most common in most of Spike's movies, we see different stories unfold. There's the relationship with Strike and Tyrone (Pee Wee Love) and Strike and Rodney.

But I was a huge admirer of the original novel version of Clockers, and I was pretty sure I could depend on a person with Lee's talents to do justice to the story. So I made sure to see this film within a couple of days of its initial release. Well, Lee took some shortcuts along the way, and I am not sure if the choices he made were the best, but the results are quite affecting.When I say that Lee's version of Clockers takes only half of the novel, I mean that what we see in the movie version is essentially the black side of the story. The investigating detective, played by Harvey Keitel, is reduced to a cipher, a straight-arrow Joe Friday type who is only there to show the 'police procedural' part of the dynamics between the police and the drug dealers to control the neighborhood. In the book, the reader comes to know the cops - ALL the cops, not just Keitel's character - as well as Strike and the dealers and the denizens of the neighborhood. Lee chooses to omit this entire aspect of the story, which is a shame, because the most powerful part of Clockers-the-novel is the way it presents the whole picture of life in a ghetto/projects area.But Lee chooses to stick with Strike and his world. I believe this was done to help Lee focus more on issues in the black community that he is most interested in, and which (in the days before the rise of 'gangsta' culture, hip-hop, and the rise of authors such as George Pelecanos and Don Goines) were (and maybe still are) severely underrepresented in mainstream cinema.And the results are still very effective. The relationship and the exchanges between Strike and his mentor (played with ferocious effectiveness by Delroy Lindo) came across on film exactly the way I'd pictured it from the book, the interiors of the bars, the squalor and graffiti in the projects, the aimlessness of some of the 'lesser lights' in the neighborhood - people who you knew would never escape...all this came across perfectly. The young actor who played Strike has just the right blend of nervous energy, youthful charisma and doomed resignation, and I keep looking for him in other roles to see what else he can do.One major complaint - at the end, Lee pulls a big cheat, by substituting a 'virtual reality' shooting game for the complex web of emotions, anger and conflict that drive a juvenile to ruin his life by shooting down a dealer. This runs counter to the whole message of the film with its lazy substitution of 'video games cheapen the value of life' versus the message of the entire rest of the film that 'racism, drugs, and poverty cheapen life'. I was very disappointed with this blatant cop out, and that knocks a star or two off the final rating.And I am still not a Spike Lee fan. But this was a good adaptation of a very challenging story.

Taking on the street drug scene in NY was hardly going to get him Oscar nominations or front covers - but the film is serious, modestly interesting and just occasionally insightful.The film is born in to bondage because no one has much of a capacity for change and we know all the rules of roughhouse urban life (or get up to speed quickly here). Strangely I expected the world to be harsher and more squalid, the setting of Summer makes the place seem almost pleasant.The central murder is almost a throwaway, like it tacked on to try and build suspense and introduce the white cops (the kind of role that Harvey Kietel can play in his sleep) to this black vicinity. Remember the no drama without conflict rule? Ok - just checking!The lead Strike (Mekhi Phifer) is not someone to feel sorry for, despite his stomach ulcers and life of self-created danger. The local drug boss (played by Delroy Lindo)  and store  owner is no cliché and has some insights about his dangerous product. Some might even see him as an entrepreneur that is only playing by rules of the street - although I certainly don't!This is really a small film and doesn't really measure up to earlier life in the 'hood movies which had some novelty value and somewhere to go. This movie rather sits and stews in its own juice, like a prison movie. Things get resolved and people are steered in the right direction, but you are left with a giant feeling that this a film about lives that are without hope or without satisfaction. The dye has long been set. Lee trys to pretend that, maybe, it is not by the closing scenes - but I am not buying it.Check out the Brazilain movie Pixote to see where certain plot lines are borrowed from.

Repeating a theme is not in itself a bad thing (in fact, there are few, if any, original ideas left) but having the same type of ending is.  In Clockers, Spike Lee portrays what I felt was a realistic depiction of the grittiness and the despair in the projects (interesting to note that a lot of the action takes place in a leafy green park in sunny weather that tends to make the projects look not so bad).  One problem ,though, comes when Lee throws in some camera tricks (the flashbacks and the kid's version of his crime), this distracts from the story and reminds us all, it's only a movie.  But my main problem comes from the ending.  In an effort to make one wonder about placing judgment, the ending comes off as hard to believe.  The is just like the old gangster movies of yore, the endings just seem too unbelievable to what was shown before.  And just like that you get a mediocre movie.

Not sure what Lee was saying here, unless it was fruit drinks are making black kids sick. Same goes for the video game that mirrored the incident where the main character's little brother blew away Arrow (great camera work on that scene, though). I'm sure some kids have been and always will be getting the wrong idea because they emulate what they see in video games and on television, but I think everyone realizes claiming that this is the root of the problem with violence among kids is essentially dodging the issue.Anyway, decent plot overrun by the usual rhetoric and allusions, though not nearly as bad as normal. A fair flick. "},{"Title":"Urbanism","Date":"26 February 2004","Score":"0 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Crime, Drama, Mystery","Review":"  Mekhi Phifer's first film.

He became a spokesperson for African Americans around the globe with his hard hitting Malcolm X and he went under fire from the victimized families of David Berkowitz during that fateful summer of 1977 in the haunting Summer of Sam. Survival of the fittest is played to the very bone in this film of a young clocker named Strike. Clockers are drug dealers that are placed at the most bottom position of the crime totem. Fed up with the way his life is going Strike goes to Rodney about moving up in the world. Rodney, a crime lord who has the neighbourhood at his fingertip, offers Strike a deal. A local night manager named Darryl Adams has banned the clockers from operating out of his premises so if Strike will take care of him Rodney will guarantee his success. Sure enough Darryl is found dead in the parking lot with four bullet wounds in his body. Here we meet a white detective named Rocco who has lost his sense of sympathy from his hardened shifts on the street. In a rather disturbing scene we see Rocco not even flinch as Darryl's body is flipped over to reveal the open bullet wounds. After numerous investigations Strike's brother Victor confession to the shooting claiming self defence. This does not satisfy Rocco who believes that he is just covering up for Strike. This is not your run of the mill detective story. This is a film that doesn't care who did it, but rather why was it done. It is a question without an answer and an answer without the right to questioning. This is a film about empowerment, embodiment and the will to stand up against anything, even yourself. This is not an over exaggerated account like Training Day and it does not sport overtly political views like American History X. This is the a showcase of a man, one a son, still a brother, a fighter, a winner, a loser, a criminal, a youth, a human being. He does not like his position in life but yearns for survival. He works a job that sells the deed to your life ever time those drugs are passed on. Lee weaves a symbolic ring that turns the streets into a household of crime but also attributes it with the power of choice, a gift to some and a curse to others. We see that these young black men are not criminals because they want to be, but because they see no other way to fulfil their duty in life even if it means losing it in the process. We see the beauty of a harsh environment and the embrace of hope, all of these men have what it takes to realize that you won't always be young but you'll always have the opportunity to change your path in life. At first I didn't like this film. It confused me and made me feel like it wanted to play tricks with my head. Then I realized that it wasn't content that mattered, it was human nature that is singing that song of hope. This film is like a symphony, sometimes it is rock solid, others soft and willing to embrace anything, but always soothing. This film is not a film about how blacks clash with whites or how street justice is the only way of life in the projects. It shows us the contrast between the stereotypical black male's surrounds and how that compares to his emotional balance in life. We are shown drug dealers who never once consume the product, we see a crime lord who doesn't appears as an honest man trying to make a living and we see a man who is more fascinated by trains than gang violence. Believe it or not this is an out rightly positive film. This is mainly due to its soundtrack of restful gospel music and enlightening R&B. IT is this music that plays for almost ninety percent of the entire film. Rarely is there moments or silence, silence is deadly. This film is the music video to your life and there is no stop button this time around. The film opens with several horrific images of real life victims lying in pools of their own blood to a moving piece by R. Kelly. Lee knows how to work his material to its highest emotional denominator by mixing the ugly with the peacefulness of the soul. Any of those who know the style of Lee will be aware that talk is cheap and nothing comes for free. Lee purposely does not give away the identity of the shooter in order to use the audience as self-examiners. There is no emphasis on dramatic irony in this film, all evidence is give as it is received, allowing the audience to attribute greatly to the films underground subtext. It is implied that Strike was the man sent to kill Darryl. Rocco believes that yes, it was Strike who committed the crime and so do we. Is it because he is black? Maybe. Is it because he has an unclean record? Possibly, but in all probability it is because he looks suspicious. It is human nature for us to stereotype what we don't understand instead of inquiring towards the facts. Black people have become known as a bunch of criminals who live on the streets. So how come a happily married man with two children and an honest job is admitting to murder? This is a film that functions out of sheer curiosity as apposed to caring. Rocco doesn't care about any of these men but looks for answers because he wants to know, that is what separates Lee from all the wanna-be film makers, he knows his material and has no problem putting his art on the line to have his message get across. Lee makes all of his films like they could be his last. Thus knowing how to attribute a negative misconception into a positive piece of real-life drama. The acting from the entire cast is riveting especially Delroy Lindo as Rodney. This could have been a character played as a big time criminal who fears nothing. Instead Lindo plays him as a God-fearing individual who appears to be living an honest life. He threatens Strike with what he will do if he ever catches him taking drugs and tells him or a dream he has where God called to him. Harvey Keitel is also great as Rocco a cop who has seen it all but still can't help himself of wanting to see more. Mekhi Phifer (Now known from 8 Mile fame) makes his debut role in a performance that demanded a lot of inner turbulence from the young star and his is fully content on giving it ever step of the way. A lot of films of this kind feel the need to preach their morals. But Lee is not a preacher or an activist, he is pound of his race and will to show it even if it costs him his dignity but in now way is he out to shove his words down your throat. He is more so a teacher that is willing to shed some light on the truth behind a stereotyped configuration of human inadequacy in the black community. You can watch this film and call it nothing but black drivel but make sure that once you are done watching it you take a good look in the mirror and like what you see, because someone just died on the streets for it.

My favorite charcter was strike played by the about to be great mekhi phiefer. this movie will have you on the edge of your seat towards the end. Harvey keitel and Delroy Lindo add terrific performances. Theres one scene in this movie that takes my breath away is when you strike watching his train set and spike lee is showing everybody how much crack has impact in america WIth beautiful music in the background. This is the most underrated movie of all time in my eyes. Very over looked and should have been nominated for a lot of oscars. Any ways even if your not a fan of spike lee you would like this movie anyways... spike lee again proves he is the best director of all time.

It's good, no doubt. But one thing that isn't mentioned here is that it seems to be a film by Spike Lee to teach the white man what it means to be a black man - especially in the projects of Brooklyn.  I found myself saying message coming in at certain parts of this.  And the trains.....come on.  It's like Lee thinks, what kind of hobby can a white person relate to?  so he picks trains...not ONLY that, but the main character doesn't like sports or b-ball or anything but trains, clocking and Mylanta.  The first half hour is strong and then the let's include the white man in on this conversation comes in and it feel obvious.  Lee needs to just tell a story and not be so concerned with the audience - whatEVER color it is.  The cinematography is excellent - the characters are great...but Lee is too concerned with making sure the whole color spectrum can relate to his stuff.... which, for me, is just a little too self conscious.  I dunno.....6 out of 10 for me.
