It's not my favorite but I admit it is very, very good....and it has some of the most touching, wonderful moments of any of her films. In fact, there were several times in the first part of this film that produced tears in my eyes. Of course, I am an old sentimentalist. Nonetheless, this is wonderful stuff.The only reason I don't rank this among my favorite Temple films is the mean old lady, Fraulein Rottenmeier, played by Mary Nash, has too big a role in the second half of the movie making for a number of unpleasant scenes. I had gotten so involved with the story that I couldn't stand to see this mean woman so nasty to Heidi (Temple). Also, there was only one song-and-dance number and that's not enough for Shirley Temple movie.The other characters were fine. Arthur Treacher provides good humor; Jean Hersholt is great as the gruff-then-loving grandfather and Marcia Mae Jones is nice as the young invalid.This is a true classic story and ends with perhaps the most gorgeous and sweetest smile I've ever seen on Shirley's face.

So well does she fill the role - eyes bright, tremendous smile & bouncing curls - that it is difficult to imagine any other young American actress of the era playing the part.Some might grumble at the various incongruities - the jumble of accents, the Dutch musical number - but that is beside the point. This was meant to be quality family entertainment and to earn Fox Studios a great deal of money. The film was a success on both scores. Director Allan Dwan ensured that the book's high points were included in the film & Fox gave HEIDI very good production values - note especially the scenes of village life in Dorfli - and a fine supporting cast gentle Jean Hersholt, perfect as the old Grandfather, gruff & lovable; droll Arthur Treacher, his comic English butler is definitely not in the original book, but he is hilarious nonetheless; Marcia Mae Jones as crippled Klara; Sidney Blackmer as her wealthy father; Sig Ruman as a police captain and elderly Helen Westley as the blind Grandmother.There are often she dragons in Shirley Temple films, bitter women who try to thwart the innocent joys of the Mighty Moppet and end up either converted or punished. HEIDI boasts two villainesses, Mady Christians as hardhearted Aunt Dete & imperious Mary Nash as the strangely evil Fr√§ulein Rottenmeier. So well do these ladies play their parts that they are able to grab some of the attention of the audience away from Miss Temple.Movie mavens should recognize Greta Meyer as a Dorfli villager & Frank Reicher as a Frankfurt police lieutenant, both uncredited.

It was only natural that Darryl F. Zanuck should choose to have his number one star play the title role in what has become a classic Shirley Temple film. Watching it, one has to be aware of just why this girl was one of the most famous of all the child stars. She has more charisma than the law allows!While not completely faithful to the book, it is adapted to make it suitable to fit Shirley Temple's growing expertise as a child actress--and for good measure, a song sequence is included--My Little Dutch Shoes--to keep Shirley's fans happy. Jean Hersholt makes a perfect Grandfather, living in the Alps and at first resistant to Shirley's charm, stern and strict in behavior. Of course his heart soon melts and soon he's even attending church again. When Heidi is kidnapped, we see her in a rich man's household. Here she helps the crippled Klara to walk again and brightens up a gloomy household. In the end, of course, she is reunited with her grandfather for a teary reunion.Perfect entertainment for youngsters who will probably fall under Temple's spell by the time the movie is over. Mary Nash is a standout as Fraulein Rottenmeier--although even meaner to Shirley in The Little Princess. Too bad this one wasn't filmed in color. There is a colorized version available on video but I'm not partial to the colorization of black and white films. The colors are often distorted and unreal.

From the moment Heidi arrives on the mountain to live with her Grandfather, the film captures ones imagination. The spirit of Heidi, the bond she develops with her Grandfather. Her finding a bed in the straw with the coverlet, milking the goat, carrying a load of firewood on her back, and my Grandson's favorite scene, sledding down the snow covered mountain on a sled, all show the child's perfect life with her Grandfather. When disrupted by her mean-spirited Aunt, and taken to live in the city, Heidi is instantly a favorite of Clara, the Butler and Clara's father. Once again, heart warming scenes capture the spirit of the girl. The monkey shines, the school lessons, the manners taught, all paint a vivid picture. None the less, Heidi and the Grandfather can not be kept apart, and each fights a mighty battle to be rejoined.

I must say I love all Shirley movies, I don't have a favorite one(except for the very first movie of hers I saw, which is very close to my heart), but Heidi is a great movie and I think everybody must see it.Heidi's an orphaned girl who lived with her aunt for six years. Then the aunt got a job and she had to live with her grandfather, a very unsociable man, who have a terrible humor and hates everyone. He lives in the mountains. Later, the aunt comes back to take Heidi to the big city to be the playmate of a girl that can't walk.I think this is one of the greatest(if it's not the best)Shirley's acting performances. In that movie she shows that she's not just a cute little girl that can tap dance and smile! She shows she's a good actress. A very good actress. I just think that only one sing-and-dance number's not enough for a Shirley Temple movie -- but the only sing-and-dance number in that film is great(In our little Wooden shoes).That story was adored by me when I was a kid. I saw an animated version, the 1970's movie version and I read the book. When I became a Shirley Temple fan and noticed that she'd played Heidi, I said WOW! Shirley played Heidi! and after I saw that movie I absolutely 'fell in love' with Shirley.There are some parts of the film that make me cry, like the Christmas scene and the ending scene(apart from Shirley's cute smile of course!).Anyway, a very good movie. Enjoyable, happy, and with the great Child-Star Shirley Temple starring in it. Anyone who wants to watch this film with the kids but think they won't like because it's black-and-white, just try.

Released at the time when classic literature became the rage at the box office, it would be a matter of time before Temple would be taking part enacting the part of a literary character taken from book to screen. With so much to choose from, Anne of Green Gables or Little Red Riding Hood, perhaps, the one that seemed most fitting was of Heidi by Johanna Spyri. And what a logical choice that was considering how it remains one of the many true Temple classics.Starting off with its opening cast and credits presented through pages of an open book, followed by a forward passage In the beautiful Alps that lie south of the black forest of Germany, on a bright June morning, two figures traveling up the steep path that leads from Mayenfeld to the little village of Dorfli, the plot development begins. Heidi (Shirley Temple), an orphan child raised by the uncaring Aunt Dete (Mady Christians), leaves her under the care of her grandfather, Adolph Kramer (Jean Hersholt), the village's most feared man whose unhappy secret is known only by Blind Anna (Helen Westley). Kramer, who for many years, has lived a recluse life in a secluded mountain cabin, is even more bitter when Dete leaves Heidi and runs off. During the course of time, however, the bitter old bearded man slowly grows fond of this child, responsible for his transformation into a kind, gentle soul. Thanks to Heidi, Kramer is now happy, returns to church and is now a welcome member of the community. Now fully established, Heidi, becomes close friends with Peter, the Goat Boy (Delmar Watson) and his grandmother, Anna. Things all change when Aunt Dete returns to take Heidi on a train trip to Frankfurt on her birthday, where Dete once again abandons Heidi, this time in the exclusive home of Fraulein Rottenmeier (Mary Nash) for financial reasons. With Heidi now acting as companion to Klara (Marcia Mae Jones), a crippled teen-aged girl and daughter of her rich employer, Herr Sesseman (Sidney Blackmer), it now appears that Heidi will never be with her grandfather again. In the meantime, the old man journeys a hundred miles by foot searching for her. Grandfather. Grandfather. Where are you? With other members of the cast consisting of Thomas Beck (Pastor Schultz); Pauline Moore (Elsa); George Humbert (The Grinder); and Sig Rumann (The Prefect of Police), Arthur Treacher is a delightful presence for amusement purposes as the lovable manservant named Andrews whose catch phrase is My, word! As much as Temple has transformed cranky old men in previous motion pictures, notably Lionel Barrymore in THE LITTLE COLONEL (1935), and Claude Gillingwater Sr. on a few others, Danish actor, her transformation towards Hersholt's Kramer is heart rendering. Because the screen treatment in itself is divided into two separate stories, Hersholt's scenes, though wonderfully played, is off screen for long stretches. During its second half, the plot goes to Heidi's involvement with the evil Fraulein Rottemeier (Mary Nash). Briefly straying away from the usual Temple formula, the writers (scripted by Walter Perrin and Julian Josephson) include a well staged dance number, Inside the Wooden Shoes (sung by Temple as a little Dutch girl ) as part of her dream sequence. At 88 minutes, it appears the film in itself was initially longer, editing down many characters ranging, Helen Westley and Delmar Watson perhaps, in favor of more Temple. Though Temple never worked with Hersholt again, she did appear opposite Nash, Treacher and Jones again in another literary story transferred to the screen, this one being THE LITTLE PRINCESS (1939 by Frances Hodgeson Burnett. In later years on a talk show in the seventies, Temple would recall the strong paste or glue smell from Hersholt's beard during their embracing scenes.Available on video cassette both in black and white and colorized formats, HEIDI, with cable TV broadcasts including The Disney Channel (colorize, 1990s), American Movie Classics (black and white from 1996 to 2001), The Fox Movie Channel, and finally Turner Classic Movies (TCM premiere July 10, 2010), HEIDI, whether it be true or loosely based on the novel, makes great family viewing from start to finish. And beware of shorter 81 minute prints that have circulated during the broadcast television era intended to fit into 90 minute time slots with commercial breaks. Although there's been other Heidi screen adaptations in later years, there's only one Shirley Temple.

She is able to charm embittered grandfather Jean Hersholt and win an entire Swiss mountain community over.Yet, in spite of all the sappiness, this is the best of Temple's movies and is both heart-warming and sweet. There are plenty of pathos and a bit of humor, especially the presence of an organ grinder's monkey who creates chaos in the Frankfurt house that Heidi is taken to against her will. It is obvious that depression era audiences needed someone like Shirley to brighten things up, so her talents can't be denied in that respect. If FDR hadn't been do popular, somebody might have endorsed Temple for president!As usual, there are evil grown-ups and in this case, it is Mary Nash as the nastiest housekeeper outside of Rebecca's Mrs. Danvers. Mady Christians is nasty as her self- serving aunt. On the good side, there is Helen Westley as a sweet blind mountain woman, Delmar Watson as her grandson who quickly befriends Heidi, Marcia Mae Jones as Clara, the Frankfurt girl whom Heidi is brought to serve as her companion, and Sidney Blackmer as Clara's kind father. Arthur Treachet offers some comical buttling and Thomas Beck is the kindly minister whom Temple tried to find a wife for.There's an unnecessarily cloying musical number that comes as part of a dream sequence rather than a plot device.

This version with Shirley Temple was also a favourite as a child and is still a delight, whether you've read the book or not. It is true that it is not the truest to the book, with some darker elements that didn't feel shoe-horned and far from traumatising, but that really doesn't matter, you can still love the book and also love the film. There could have been more of the relationship between Heidi and her grandfather(but it is still really touching) and the musical number In Our Little Wooden Shoes while catchy, well-staged and cute didn't add a whole lot to the story, in fact really it was irrelevant. Everything else is fine, and I found it superior to the 1993 Noley Thornton version(which was still good), it doesn't feel over-dramatic even with the added darker parts, the characters are far more truthfully and sympathetically written with much more of a character journey with the grandfather and there's more heart. Heidi is a lovely film to look at, being crisply and lovingly filmed, scenery that makes you wish you were right there and the costumes give a genuine sense of time and place(they look good too, yes even Heidi's poor clothes). The music is whimsical and sparkling, the dialogue has a very good balance of funny and meaningful and the story essentially has every bit the charm, heart-warming sentiment and emotion that the book has, the ending is well and truly sweet and not tacky. The sled chase, any scene with Fraulein Rottenmeier and the monkey are standout scenes. Heidi is briskly directed with enough time for the story to resonate and for the actors to really go for it. Jean Hersholt plays grumpy and heartfelt beautifully, while reclusive there is a real sense that he cares for Heidi and she for him. Mary Nash is the very meaning of beastly- living aptly up to her character's name- and absolutely relishes it, while Arthur Treacher is hilarious as the butler Andrews and Marcia Mae Jones is an affecting Klara. But it's Shirley Temple's film, she's adorable and while she manages to be charming and have wonderful comic timing she is equally good at displaying an emotional side, her acting in the scene in the police station(another memorable scene) is just heart-breaking. While she is the main attraction of the film, the other characters and actors are just as believable to not make Heidi too much of a Shirley Temple show.

Incidentally, not only have I recently acquired &#150; or watched &#150; a number of the director's later efforts, but I've even watched a later TV adaptation of the Johanna Spyri novel.As it turned out, the film is an utterly professional (and typically handsome) Darryl F. Zanuck production but I think that the story was tailored far too much to suit the ebullient child star's usual formula not only do we get Arthur Treacher (receiving unwarranted third billing!) as a typically bemused butler, but Temple is made to act as cupid between the new parson and the local schoolmarm; besides, we're treated to a totally irrelevant fantasy song-and-dance number, two separate antagonists in the shape of her aunt and jealous governess &#150; not to mention the apparently requisite corny final close-up! Among the differences I noticed from the 1968 version (which is probably more faithful to the source material) is the fact that Temple befriends the invalid child immediately and even gets to be the one who cures her psychosomatic ailment! Besides, the incidents which climax the later version i.e. Grandfather's religious redemption and Clara's 'cure' itself occur earlier here, whereas the highlight of the film is taken up by a sleigh-chase in the snow with the Police pursuing the hysterical Grandfather! The overly made-up Jean Hersholt is fine as the latter, while the supporting cast also includes Mary Nash as the overbearing Governess, Sidney Blackmer as Clara's father (whose role is much reduced here) and Sig Rumann in a bit part as a police official.

This is a good example of how sentimental her movies are, sometime being overly so and some would say manipulatively so, as they don't make movies like that anymore. But Heidi is taken to live with her grandfather, played by Jean Hersholt, who is reputed to be a mean old man, who disowned his son when he married a young lady he didn't like. When they died, she is then taken to her grandfather by an Aunt. Many an old heart can that little girl melt. But the plot doesn't stop there. She is then separated from him and goes to live with a sickly girl who is in need of friendship. But when the nanny, who doesn't want the sick girl to get well and has her own agenda, played wickedly good by Mary Nash, doesn't like Shirley's optimism and gaiety helping her girl to recover, things happen and with no holds barred. Oh, and Arthur Treacher is hilarious as the butler. Melodramatic stuff? Yes! Subtle? No! But this film has heart and you can't complain about Shirley Temple, who's as genuine as can be. Watch Heidi and see just how sweet Shirley Temple was and how she can captivate an audience and tug at your heart.

I know it's a super-famous book and I've seen a few of the movies. But what I do know is that this Twentieth Century-Fox version was FAR from the original tale. It's still entertaining, but it's not Heidi.The story begins in the German mountains. This is odd, as it was actually supposed to be Switzerland and I wonder why the studio changed this--especially in light of the rising oppression in Nazi Germany. It begins with Heidi's aunt bringing the girl to live with her Grandfather. He has no interest in the child or anyone else, as he long ago disowned his child and became a hermit. But, VERY quickly (much more quickly than it should), Heidi brings out the man's love and humanity and all is well. However, the aunt returns to kidnap the child (not in the original story) and the rest of the tale is set in Frankfurt--where Heidi becomes the companion of a disabled girl. This portion of the story is somewhat like the original, though there was no kidnapping and the housekeeper was NOTHING like the original--and instead of just being stuffy, she's evil and a criminal who eventually tries to sell Heidi to gypsies!!! Again, certainly NOT in the original story. But, in the end, all is finally well and Heidi is returned to her loving grandfather.If you have never read or seen a film based on the original story, the 1937 version is wonderful. As usual, Shirley Temple is great and I can even forgive the totally unnecessary song and dance number inexplicably inserted into the movie. Having watched the 1993 Noley Thornton version which closely follows the story, however, I know that the story can be a lot better. Decent but see the 1993 version instead...or in addition.

Brought back many memories of the pre-10 yr. old days for me.- & what a treat seeing comic genius Arthur Treacher again!?! As the butler, he NEARLY stole-the-show. Recall him on Merve Griffin's early TV series. He was a riot as-a-guest. Shirley's not bad either, but that governess was EVIL!?! Surprised she didn't scare us more than Margaret Hamilton as the Wicked Witch of the West!!! Share this wonderful film with your children. Or enjoy it again-all-over for just YOU!!!... Forget all the remakes & stick with this ORIGINAL. You can't beat it! "},{"Title":"Not recommended for diabetics","Date":"4 September 2005","Score":"","Genre":"Family, Drama","Review":" One of Temple's biggest hits for 20th Century Fox, this version of Johanna Spyri's much-filmed children's classic might provide suitable entertainment for young children but will prove far too saccharine-sweet for any adult whose critical facilities aren't compromised by watching the film through rose-coloured spectacles&#133;The little moppet plays the eponymous heroine, a spunky little madam with an infectious grin and an abundance of curls, who is foisted upon her grumpy Santa-look-alike Grandpa (Jean Hersholt) by her wicked Aunt Dete (Mady Christians) who has found work in Frankfurt. Of course, it's not long before Heidi has melted grumpy old Grandpa's heart, which is the cue for the wicked Aunt to snatch Heidi back and whisk her to Frankfurt to be companion to Klara (Marcia Mae Jones) the crippled daughter of her employer&#133; Nine-year-old Temple is cute as a button in this one, and has enough screen presence to carry even mediocre material. The story is decent enough, and the production values are good, but the heavy doses of sentimentality injected into the plot at regular intervals really get too much to stomach after a while and are wholly unnecessary. If you can overcome that however, the story does offer a fair measure of suspense as it reaches its inevitably happy ending, and any film with not one but two wicked witches has to be awarded points for originality. Arthur Treacher is also worth catching as an outwardly stiff butler who is really a big softie on the inside. It was a role he would repeat with Temple in the inferior The Little Princess a couple years later.Watch the black-and-white version if you get the chance, because the colourised version is an absolute horror (when are they anything else?). Everybody's lips and tongue are the same colour as their skin&#133; "},{"Title":"Lamentable vehicle for Shirley Temple","Date":"6 August 2006","Score":"","Genre":"Family, Drama","Review":" The tale of Heidi is such a groaner that it manages to defeat any little, bright-eyed young actress who stars in it, yet they keep trying. Here, it's Shirley Temple's turn at the waterworks playing a spunky young orphan living with her kindly grandpa in a Swiss village, kidnapped by a scheming relative and taken off to live with a rich, unpleasant brood in Germany. Was there ever a more contemptible or manipulative kids' story than this? Treacly hokum is mixed with melodramatic hysteria, with enough story contrivances to fill up several pictures. Kids seem to get caught up in it; adults may go a little batty. *1/2 from **** "}]
