[{"Title":"Not much more than a continuation, but still a worthy sequel.","Date":"2 December 2004","Score":"27 out of 30 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Fantasy, Horror","Review":" I think I liked Child's Play 2 more than most people, given the reviews that I've read and the movie's low voter rating on the IMDb. A cute kid's doll is once again the unlikely home of Charles Lee Ray, notorious serial killer, again feeding off of the surrealism created by seeing a kid's doll screw it's face into expressions of the purest rage and spouting all manner of profanities. By now, Ray is becoming more and more desperate to get out of the body of the doll, because as we were informed in the first film, if he spends too much time in that body he'll gradually become more and more human until one day he'll be stuck in it forever. Needless to say, Ray's a lot more interested in starting life over as a 6-year-old (and who wouldn't?) rather than spending the rest of his life as a plastic doll.Although, given that he becomes more human the longer he is in that body, how human will he eventually become? Will he ever reach full human-hood? My guess is that he'll gradually approach being a real human being in a sort of half life, where he gets closer and closer and closer but never actually gets there, kind of like computer generated actors. There is currently much talk about how close computers can ever get to animating convincingly real people into the movies, and the leading theory seems to be something akin to my theory of Chucky turning human. He'll always get closer but he'll never get all the way there.At any rate, Andy's mother has landed in a mental institution and Andy has been taken in by a foster family with appropriate mental vacuity to be a horror movie surrogate family. When Andy becomes frightened and runs through the house, his foster father grabs him and says, 'Rule #1, no running in the house!' OK, 'dad,' but not even when I open a closet and find myself confronted by the doll that landed my mom in the nuthouse and almost cost me my life and my very soul? My God, man, what the hell is this guy doing with a Good Guys doll in the house in the first place? It's difficult enough trying to figure out why it's even there WITHOUT having to watch this mental giant grab Andy by the arm and ask him what on earth is the matter.There are some funny moments in the film, such as when Chucky smashes the head of the innocent Good Guys doll, buries it, and takes its place in the house, and my favorite, when Chucky is later addressed by a doting adult, Chucky responds by saying in his cute doll voice, 'Hi! I'm&#133;.Tommy!'The stockholders in the Play Pal corporation are distressed over the suffering that the company has endured due to the negative publicity of the events of the first movie provide the premise for the movie's rather impressive finale. In order to generate a more positive image for the company and the doll, they have decided to reintroduce it into the market. The original Chucky doll was collected by the company and examined by toy-makers, who decided that there really was nothing truly wrong with it, it was not really a demon-possessed toy, so they decided to melt it down and remake it. Why they didn't just throw it away I'm not really sure, but who cares. Waste not, want not, I guess.At any rate, Chucky comes back in a fresh plastic body (too bad he can't be transferred to a human as easily as he can be transferred from one doll body to another), and once again resumes his quest for Andy's soul. I've heard complaints about why Chucky had to go after Andy and couldn't just find a bum on the street or something, but you'll remember in the first movie, the conditions of his plastic entrapment stated that he could only transfer into the body of the first person that he revealed his identity to once he was inside the Chucky doll.Jarrett Friend, writing for HorrorWatch, made the above suggestion having forgotten that little stipulation, but also smartly suggested that the plot should have involved a huge number of Chucky dolls, since the original doll was melted down and whose plastic conceivably should have infected much more dolls than just the one that we saw in this movie. This would have made the movie much more interesting and added another level of originality; my guess is they just didn't have the budget for something that big.Nevertheless, even though the first sequel in the Child's play series comes dangerously close to falling into that sophomore sequel chasm of falling flat because of obviously feeding off the success of its predecessor without having much of anything to add to the story, Child's Play 2 escapes into the world of moderately acceptable horror sequels, kind of like Psycho II, which had no hope of matching its predecessor but at least was able to justify its own existence. I think it's easy to be put off by the conclusion of Child's Play 2, but I was pretty impressed with the toy factory setting, if only because it created such a great atmosphere for Chucky to make his hunt and Andy and his foster sister Kyle to try vainly to escape. There was some pretty clever stuff in the final act of the film, not including, however, the scene where Kyle and Andy run around completely lost, making the factory seem like a maze by editing together a lot of clips of them clearly running around the same corner half a dozen times or so. A bit trite, but nothing compared to my biggest gripe of the film, which is the final scene, one of the goofier things that I've seen on an otherwise at least moderately competent horror movie. Odd for a movie to try so hard to live up to its expectations and then belittle itself with something like what I'll just call the air hose scene. I do, however, think that the movie was successful and good enough to deserve a better DVD than it got. I can't stand it when the only extra features on the DVD for a successful film are nothing but some foreign audio tracks and cast and crew history that is nothing more than a brief biography and a list of film credits. What do you think the IMDb is for?

Writer Don Mancini also must have figured out that his creation of a foul-mouthed killer doll was too good for just one film. The Chucky series would seriously evolve and change over the years but even in this first sequel things are already looking quite different, even if it suffers from Deja Vu a little bit.Now that the cat is out of the bag and we know that Chucky really is alive and it isn't just Andy's imagination, our killer doll gets much more screen time and his wicked personality has more time to develop. The animatronics have improved and a lot of Chucky's character comes through in his wild facial expressions.Director John Lafia shoots the film with a bright, playroom color pallet with most of the location footage done in Los Angeles with only a few key shots done in Chicago (as if the Windy City was ever this sunny). Despite the autumn setting it does feel like a rather Xmas-y film. He's also fully aware of how silly the killer doll concept is and seizes the opportunity for some of the self-aware sarcastic humor seen in the later films. Graeme Revell usually does the most generic horror scores, especially in recent years, but surprisingly he gives Child's Play 2 the best score of the series with a full orchestra at his disposal, he doesn't hold back on the action cues and even delivers a couple of pretty good themes. So much better than the rotten score to the first film and probably one of the best horror scores of the 90s, or even of all time. It really is that good, and elevates this sequel to a higher level than most snobby critics would consider it deserves.There isn't much of a story to Child's Play 2 however. It's just the same as the first, with Chucky going after Andy, who is now staying with a foster family, once more. The body count is higher and there are some good kills, but I wish that the running time wasn't so anorexic and that it held back on the lurking in the dark scenes.The slick quality and silly nature of Child's Play 2 is probably what prompted Universal to stick with the franchise for good and 23 years later the Chucky films are still coming out. To think that if MGM held on to the rights, we may never have had them.

While unfortunately, Chris Sarandon and Catherine Hicks do not return, they are at least mentioned, and given plausible reasons as to why they could not be in the movie. Innocent Andt Barclay (Alex Vincent) however returns, and is once again at the mercy of Chucky (voiced by the classic Brad Douriff) when Chucky traces Andy down to where he is living in foster care. From there, the typical mayhem follows, with plenty of doll-style murders, witty lines from Chucky and a great finale at the Good Guy doll factory.While the original Child's Play is a terrifying classic, part 2 is somewhat of a step down, only because one knows what to expect, for the most part. However, the cast are a great asset to the film. Alex Vincent is right on the mark in his role as Andy, Christine Elise is terrific as his foster sister Kyle, and Jenny Agutter adds a touch of class as their foster mother Joanne Simpson. Gerrit Graham plays her strict husband, and Grace Zabriskie is good in her role as the career at the orphanage. Beth Grant steals the moment in her small role as Mrs Kettlewell however. Overall, a fun sequel to the original, with a well rounded cast and plenty of thrills to keep one entertained.

The first film was a very entertaining horror film. The second movie in the series isn't as good, but it's not real bad either. However, the filmmakers took the gory route for this one. All the graphic violence makes it less effective. The first movie worked so well because it kept the violence down to a minimal. Oh the first film was violent, but not as violent as this one. But it's stylish look somehow makes it watchable. And, like the original, it's entertaining to watch.

Of all the films within major horror series stretching from the late '70s to the '90s -- Friday the 13th, A Nightmare on Elm Street and Halloween among them -- Child's Play 2 deserves a place very close to the top.This sequel picks up two years after the original in which young Andy Barclay (Alex Vincent) was tormented by Chucky, the killer-possessed doll trying to transfer his soul into the child's body. With his mother traumatized, Andy is sent to live with a foster family. Trouble is, there's a certain rebuilt Good Guy brand doll all too eager to get reacquainted.Child's Play 2 is solid horror fare. It has legitimate thrills as the seemingly innocent doll plunges to murderous life in the blink of an eye. It has a smart, unpredictable storyline. Its strongest asset, however, is an exciting finale at the Good Guy doll factory in which Chucky, piece by piece, meets his maker. First he's forced to amputate his own hand (he replaces it with a knife blade). Then his legs are torn off in an unsuccessful maiming. Next he's showered in gallons of steaming hot doll plastic before finally having an electrical cord stuffed in his mouth, exploding his head into a thousand gooey pieces. Where do they come up with this stuff?There are plenty of other things to like about this picture. Its budget is much higher than that of the original, a fact that shows up in leaps and bounds on the screen. With the origin storyline out of the way, the sequel is able to focus solely on the excitement without getting bogged down in too many details. And Brad Dourif outdoes himself as the creepily frightening voice of the homicidal doll.Child's Play 2 established Chucky as a legitimate horror icon. Simply put, the series never again reached this high a caliber and probably never will.

Although a freak electrical current kills one of their employees and revives the doll. Knowing that he has to get out this body, Chucky goes about trying to locate Andy, so he can transfer his soul into his body.The lovable, foul-mouthed good guy doll is back at it again in this far from surprising sequel spawned by the original's success. Old habits die young in this basically unnecessary no frills retread of the original film. Actually, the horrifying thing is that I don't mind this effort. It's still my favourite sequel of the series, just ahead of Bride of Chucky. Directing his debut feature with plenty of verve and focus happens to be John Lafia (co-writer of the screenplay for Child's Play), who ups the ante in mostly every department. There's more hectically nervy mayhem, spur of the moment thrills and rather a mean spirited vibe worked in. Chucky's one sadistic little monster here and it seems to exploit its premise for the sheer of it. Popping up are many amusing moments that are plain rib tickling and a few unexpected splashes of suspense. The nastily inspired and glaring death scenes are well thought out. Time breezes by because of tight pacing and crisp editing. The silliness of the concept is simply taken to the extreme with constant use of smarting one-liners and devilish puns. The tongue is heavily planted in cheek within its jest-like tone.Written again by original creator Don Mancini. The straightforward script nicely rounds off what had happened to the major players of the first film and how Chucky was resurrected. After that it goes for a basic stalk and slash formula with more blood and violence to cover up systematic gimmick. Instead of the icy cold Chicago downtown setting this time Mancini decides to go suburbia on this foray. While, it's cliché bound and everything about this one looks plastic. It's commendably made production with a glossily bright tinge to the set designs (like the surreal-like toy factory). The slick photography by Stefan Czapsky is lithely orchestrated and Graham Revell's ominous sounding music score hits all the right chords. Kevin Yagher's animatronics creation of Chucky has advanced a little more with refined detail and zeal developments. The face and body movements seem a bit more flexible.Who gave this doll life was the ultra-cool and memorably wicked vocal performance of Brad Dourif as Chucky. It became Dourif's definite trademark role. Alex Vincent returns and isn't particularly that convincing in a stiff performance as Andy. Gladly it doesn't do any damage, but only enhances the traumatic angle they are going for. Having the same person playing the role added some continuity though. Adding a professional touch to this b-grade fluff were the likes of the always elegantly classy Jenny Agutter and ripely formal Gerrit Graham were likable as the foster parents Joanne and Phil Simpson. Christine Elise is fittingly strong as the delinquent teen Kyle. Also there are minor, but decent performances by Grace Zabriskie, Beth Grant and Greg Germann.The novelty isn't a complete waste, but if you take the unbelievably illogical premise and the unpleasant nature with a grain of salt. There's sure entertainment amongst this nonsense that doesn't pretend to be anything else.

The little boy he turned into an orphan is leaving the clinic now that he's over the traumatic situation (or so the head of the clinic tells his adoptive parents). His adoptive parents take him home and you know things aren't going to settle down when a Chucky doll drops from the top shelf of a closet he's exploring.The evil Chucky doll finds his way to the household, switches places with the toy doll and buries it, setting the stage for things to come. Credibility really is strained by the time we get to the schoolroom scene where Chucky has followed the boy to school, lands magically in his classroom and manages to start trouble between the boy and the teacher, who subsequently gets killed by Chucky after the boy has climbed out a window. Takes quite an imagination to think of these plot lines, but when the imagination runs wild plausibility begins to suffer. Following the schoolhouse segment, the bizarre incidents keep piling up as Chucky gets away with more and more havoc and no one believes the boy is telling the truth--just as in the original.None of the incidents are as startling or as well staged as in CHILD'S PLAY, but it still manages to hold the interest with some original touches tinged with fright and a weird sense of humor. Especially good are the effects toward the end when Chucky holds the spunky adopted girl and boy captive as the story speeds toward an ending in the toy factory. The factory sequence has some grotesque chills as one of the workers gets caught up in the doll machinery and Chucky himself suffers quite a few happenings at the toy factory before he's liquidated by the boy.Entertaining nonsense despite the strain on credibility.

And of course, the smart thing to do would be to continue the story from the first movie. And for the most part, the sequel stays faithful to the story line. It does have a few areas that need to be addressed but all around it pretty much matches its parent. After the torturous event of Charles Lee Ray (The Lakeshore Strangler) attacking the Barclay home, it was time to move on. Sadly things didn't get better for Andy Barclay. Andy's mother is sent to a psych ward for help and Andy is put into a foster home. Making matters worse, is the Good Guy Doll company somehow acquired the burnt dismembered parts of Chucky and decided to clean him off and put him back together. Unbeknownst to them, once re-assembled, Chucky comes back to life and begins his rampage of violence to find Andy again. And that's all there is to this. It is just another set up to have Chucky (voice by Brad Dourif) killing people to get to the boy that he told his secret to. Is it bad? No, it actually can hold its own as a good sequel.The weakest area is Mr. Mancini's writing. For example, very few audiences are familiar with voodoo and it's never explained to why Chucky came back to life after being re-assembled. Was that apart of the voodoo spell? Besides, in the first movie, wasn't it shooting Chucky in the heart the only way to kill him? That's a big loophole. However, it's also forgivable because a lot of people like Chucky, so it's obvious a lot of people will not care too much. It's crazy though how similar this sequel is like Hellraiser II Hellbound (1988). The director of Hellbound was a crewmember for Hellraiser (1987) and then directed the sequel. Same goes for John Lafia, the director of this film. He too was apart of Child's Play (1988) and then went on to direct the sequel to this franchise. And both sequels are decent and have good continuity but suffer from weak reasoning for the logic behind the continuity. A very similar parallel that is interesting to think about.As for actors, it's obvious that Brad Dourif is needed to play Chucky and his performance is always the best. Next is Alex Vincent whom fans should be happy to see because he's a key part of why Chucky exists and his performance is just as likable as he was from the first movie. Lastly is Christine Elise who plays another foster child named Kyle who befriends Andy. At a point she develops a strong will to fight and it's good that she wasn't written in as a scream and do nothing girl. But as for the rest of the cast, they aren't much to talk about. The foster parents and every other individual are the same. They don't believe a killer doll exists (and right fully so, IF this were a reality). Oh well, their loss.The last couple of elements that viewers should enjoy is the cinematography by Stefan Czapsky and music. Unlike the first movie, which contained grittier and darker colors, this movie has brighter more elementary colors, which give something new for fans to look at. Plus, the music produced by upcoming composer at the time, Graeme Revell, did a much better job than the score from the first movie by Joe Renzetti. Here Revell actually uses an orchestra and not just synths. And, Revell even gives the Child's Play franchise a motif theme and some creepy tunes. A well developed horror score. Does it top its predecessor - no. Is it a good sequel - yes.Like other horror sequels, it lacks clarification on logic but it still amounts to a decent sequel. The score has improved as well allowing to sound more like a horror film.

It has many moments to rival the original films many suspenseful sequences, such as Andy looking for Chucky, while roaming about the basement in the middle of the night, where he knows Chucky is hiding out. Teen bad girl Kyle, discovering the corpse of her foster mother & being attacked by Chucky in the bedroom only for him to disappear & her looking around wondering where he will strike. A huge stalk & chase in a doll factory etc. KEVIN YAGHER'S new Chucky puppet is much better looking than his old one. It's clear the film-makers had more money to play with, since they are able to do more things with the puppet than what they were last time. The co-screenwriter of the first, JOHN LAFIA (DON MANCINI also returns to pen the script) slips into the directors chair for this one, taking the reigns from original director Tom Holland & does a fabulous job, milking many scenes in the film, for more maximum tension suspense & impact. BRAD DOURIF reprises his role as Chucky (He provides the voice) & further goes to show that in another actors hands, Chucky just wouldn't be anywhere near as fun. The acting works for the most part, Christina Elise is really good as the teenage heroine of the show, while An American Werewolf In London's own JENNY AUGUTTER & C.H.U.D. II's GERRIT GRAHAM, both put in good performances as the foster family. Alex Vincent continues to be a real find in his role as the sympathetic Andy. What should be noted about CHILD'S PLAY 2 is despite it's serious storyline, the film-makers have turned him into an almost Freddy Kruger like character, since he spews a series of bad puns before, during & after he dismantles his victims, something he didn't do in the first. Weather taking the franchise into the realm that the later A NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET entries went with Freddy, was a choice on the film-makers part, or a result of the studio heads is not known. The film has a light sprinkling of comedy, as one can't help but chuckle at Chucky's bad puns. What also should be noted is how several concepts in the film are taken from the original film's psychological horror driven script (Then titled BLOOD BUDDY) a bully who troubles Andy (Though this adds nothing to the film & could so easily have been written around) & a teacher who keeps Andy after school winds up being killed by Chucky, when he batters her repeatedly with a ruler (Ironically enough the original CHILD'S PLAY script was later adopted & re-written in areas & filmed as Pinocchio's Revenge/Pinocchio Syndrome, a direct to video horror film released in 1996)That said I did have a problem with the films concept early on. We are informed from the outset, that Andy's mother has been put in a psychiatric hospital over her claims that Chucky was alive & was doing all the murders, yet whatever became of Mike Norris & his partner? surely they could have backed her story, since they both seen Chucky alive themselves? Since Chucky was becoming human at the end, wouldn't the police & Play Pal Toy executives find it a little odd that Chucky had a human tongue, blood in him, & human teeth? what about his body? would it not contain some human organs including remnants of his shot to pieces heart? wouldn't this give them cause to pause & wonder why a plastic doll, had these odd features? speaking of the body, why is it that his head is used by the executives to see what malfunctioned & not the rest of the body? what made them think that the head had something to do with a malfunction & not some other part of the doll? None of this is really answered. GRAEME REVELL does the score here & it's terrific throughout. Look for MATT ROE as a cop, he played a psychic in PUPPET MASTER, another killer doll movie to emerge on video shelves after the original CHILD'S PLAY.All in all, while is is nowhere near as scary as the first, CHILD'S PLAY 2 has it's own wicked sense of style & fun. It's not very gory, but it's death scenes are pretty neat & the whole plot is pretty fun. Highly entertaining & fun & definitely recommended to fans of the first.

Brad Douriff is back as the maniacal voice of the pint-sized murderer.  What you would expect from a sequel of this caliber is pretty much what you get.  Little plot, little characterization, lots of killing, lots of blood, lots of gore effects, and a Chucky that comes back, comes back, comes back, comes back, and comes back.  I got so tired of watching Chucky come out of situations where he was supposed to be 'dead that it was like a test of endurance for my common sense.  Vincent does a good job with his role, but the film really lacks from the freshness and individuality of the original film's characters.  I don't know why people that make horror sequels always think it is just the gore and blood which makes the first film popular.  They are integral parts, but the film probably(not always) has other elements that appeal to people over 15.  This sequel eliminates those elements and makes it very clear that its intended audience is between 15-19.  Pity, because I found the first film very effective and slightly intelligent on one level.  This film is really nothing more than one killing after another until we get to the factory where other Chuckies are made and the real nonsense begins in what has to be one of the most ridiculous finales of a horror film I have seen in some time.

But in some cases, cheesy is exactly what you want from a movie. Especially if it features a red-haired freckled doll possessed by a serial killer. Come on people, of course this movie was going to be cheesy. The first one just about managed to keep it together with some suspense, but once you've done the big reveal there's not a lot of credible scares you can wring out of this premise. What's left is having fun with it, and Child's Play 2 does that very well. From the opening scene in which Chucky is reconstructed by the original toy factory (for a nonsensical reason, but who cares?), it has this obvious sequel quality to it. The thing that could not be destroyed, but was, is back, and he's angrier than ever! The cliché of the cynical company bosses is played out and then we're on our way. That first scene sets the mood really well, you really get everything you need to get an idea what this movie is going to be like. Over the top, campy, set in its own reality. There really was no other way to go after the over the top ending of Child's Play 1, with the melted, barely recognizable Chucky dragging himself to his victims for a final scare. So we get some enjoyable one-liners from old Chuckles, and I definitely got some chuckles out of his killer lines. Literally, because most of his one-liners are accompanied buy an equally funny kill. About those kills, well, they're maybe not even extremely creative, but they're sure as hell effective. In the beginning of the movie all of the people Chucky kills really deserve to die (in horror-movie terms that is, obviously no one really deserves to die). I'm rooting for Chucky when he kills the underling of the company director who brought old Charles back in the first place and who's just a slimy little weasel. Then Chucky manages to kill Andy's horrible teacher with a ruler, in the classroom where she locked Andy. And even when foster dad Phil is killed on the way to punish little Andy for misbehaving, you're still sort of rooting for the doll. But no horror movie can thrive on just murdering bad guys, so from that point on the movie takes a more action-driven mood, which is done quite nicely. In the end, we go back to real sequel territory when we return to the good guy doll factory for an ultimate showdown, set to a background of thousands of good guy dolls in various stages of being manufactured. That just works brilliantly. The acting in this movie never strays into academy award winner territory, but it's sufficient, and especially little Andy and his stepsister Kyle play their parts pretty well. Of course the real star is Brad Dourif who serves his cheesy lines with a side order of ham. The effects are again nothing mind-blowing (well... one effect is, but that's not a description of its quality, it just literally blows Chucky's mind apart), but they're not bad. Add to that a pretty good score, decent camera work and editing, and you have a nice little brain-snack. I don't think it was anyone's intention to make this a great piece of art. It's pulp, entertainment. Ultimately pointless, but a great watch when you're bored. I can't rate this higher than a 6 objectively, but in my heart I would have given it a 7 or 8, just because it's so unpretentious. Horror sequels that try to artificially invoke the same terror the original had to offer are usually horrible to watch. Child's Play 2, although it is of course nowhere near as good as the first movie, made the right choice to take a different approach.

You don't hate them enough to want them to die, or like them enough to care what happens to them, so you end out with just some 'people'. You don't know them, you don't like them, you don't care. The only character I ever had interest in was the adopted sister, and even her character wasn't that great. The animatronics and puppetry are amazing though. Chucky walks, stands up, and makes complicated gestures on screen. His movement looks very realistic without any CGI, and I found this very impressive. The soundtrack is good, but at some times a little too familiar to other horror films scores. The kills in this film are also not that effective as scary, due to the fact that there is calm time between many of the murders. They end up coming off as slightly overly gruesome, making it even harder for the movie to be fun. In all I thought Child's Play 2 was an okay movie, but it doesn't have the a scares of CP1, or the fun of CP3.

Though it doesn't quite hit home with the same quality as the original.","Date":"13 September 2014","Score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Fantasy, Horror","Review":" There's something to marvel at while watching Child's Play 2. From a grandiose score courtesy of the wonderful Graeme Revell. To some really fascinating set-design. To quirky, stylized direction from John Lafia. And even a few key scenes that have a timeless, mythical feel. It seems that the creative team behind Child's Play 2 sought to not only create an effective sequel, but also build the character of Chucky into the sort of thing that legends are made of. This is a big, bombastic, wild ride of a film, constrained within the guise of being a standard slasher-sequel.But, there's something important to think about. A key question. Does it work?And the answer to that question Sort of, I guess.Following a wild opening in which Chucky (voiced by the fantastic Brad Dourif) is re-constructed in a way that I actually found quite intriguing, he escapes and sets off to find his old target- young Andy Barclay (Alex Vincent), who is in the process of being placed into a new foster home. With his new body, Chucky hopes to finally be able to transfer his tormented spirit into a human host once and for all. And so a sort-of deadly game begins, as Chucky infiltrates Andy's new home, and toys with him, causing him distress and picking off the people around him, leading up to a final confrontation that I can only describe as epic in scope and quite satisfying.Returning screenwriter Don Mancini seems more at home this time around (after some apparent drama with the first film going into rewrites), and relishes in the chaos of the storyline. You can feel a writer just having fun with the material when you watch this film. Everything is bigger. Stakes rise to new heights. Set-pieces are more encompassing and wild. And there are new ideas being explored left and right.John Lafia's guidance as director is quite good. While the original film was slick and grounded, Lafia here goes for stylized visuals that lend a unique quality to the film, making it feel more akin to a fairy-tale. And I really enjoyed that aspect of the production. Although at times it does take you out of the movie, because things are a little TOO stylish. (A scene where a character has to run around a maze of boxes, while suspenseful, will probably make you chuckle and exclaim Who stacks boxes like that?!)I found the performances admirable. Alex Vincent grows quite a bit as a young performer. Though I didn't mention it in my review of the first film, I never found his acting organic or believable. He was just a little too young and a little too cute for you to believe the emotions he was trying to convey. But here, he knocks it out of the park. He's a bit older, as had more experience acting, and is able to give a really remarkable, compelling performance for a child-actor. Supporting roles by the likes of Christine Elise and Jenny Agutter are also quite good. Particularly Elise as Kyle, Andy's older Foster Sister, who becomes the person he connects with most in the story. She has a lot of heart in her performance, and comes off well on- screen, and along with Andy, is the one person you really care for.And of course there is Brad Dourif. He IS Chucky. His role is a perfect blend of different elements, combining to create a near-ideal slasher-movie villain. Dourif's voice is commanding and threatening, yet also oddly endearing and amusing when it needs to be. His delivery is spot-on in every scene. And he is able to take charge of every scene he's in.All of this being said, I do think there are a lot of fundamental issues with the film. And I do believe that despite rampant strengths, it just doesn't quite gel together as it did in the first movie.Despite the more grandiose scale and qualities of the film, I thought it didn't do quite as good a job at forging human connections. With so much chaotic content, the smaller moments just seemed to become lost in translation, which is a pretty big issue. This is a film of style over substance.I also felt that the film lost me at a few times. Some of the performers aren't up to snuff (despite the main cast being great), some of the deaths are bizarre and weak, and some moments just seemed silly, or went on for far too long.If the film could have gone through just a little bit more trimming and re-editing, I think it could easily have matched the quality of the original.But still, as it stands, Child's Play 2 is highly enjoyable, albeit flawed. And I think that in the grand scheme of things, it's definitely worth checking out for all fans of horror. If the story doesn't win you over, the crazy, mythical style just might.I give it an average 6 out of 10.

The photography of the scary scenes would have been so beautiful in high-def, but somehow the fact that it is not high-def lends a sort of creepy feel to the cinematography.

Now, after sending the offending dolly back to hell, he's back again (you don't need to know how - basically the same way Freddy, Jason or Michael Myers always comes back - yet - again). And, guess what, Andy Barclay is top of his 'hit list.' Brad Dourif returns to voice the killer doll, Chucky, and he gets it right on the mark again. However, the story does get a little bit repetitive after a while. It focuses around no one believing Andy that his doll is alive (and evil), only to find they're proved wrong when the doll kills them in a grisly manner (rinse and repeat). Plus you can tell who's going to die a mile off - all the adults are pretty horrible and you won't really shed a tear when any of them get gutted. Then there are the lapses in physics, i.e. when a plastic doll can regularly overpower fully-grown adults.However, despite all its flaw, Child's Play 2 just about does the job. If you liked the first one, this one does its best to keep the franchise going along the same lines. However, if you're new to the films, I'd start off with the first one (it's easily the best and scariest) before seeing if you want to watch this one, too.http//thewrongtreemoviereviews.blogspot.co.uk/ "},{"Title":"It's a decent continuation with Chucky","Date":"5 June 2014","Score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Fantasy, Horror","Review":" I thought the way they revived Chucky after they over-killed Chucky in the first installment was kinda dumb. They replaced the whole Chucky doll except the shell for the head and apparently that is enough for the soul of Charles Lee Ray to make it back into the doll. The first one worked because of it's originality and mystery for the most part. Although the audiences knew what was going on the characters wasn't sure what to think. This time the protagonist Andy knows about Chucky and what he is capable of. After the first movie Andy is put into foster care since his mother got sent to a mental asylum. Anyways Chucky is back and he is back to his old mischievous tricks again of playing just a doll and sneaking around to kill people. The first one had meat to it and knew what direction to take with what they had. This time around it just didn't really seem to have a sense of direction. However I still give this one credit, because after the the first installment ending this one was a logical direction to take. Unless they wanted to start over with another group of family that buys the doll, but that would just be a rehash. This time Chucky is back for vengeance and for Andy's body. Most of this movie seemed pretty mundane with almost no suspense or cool Chucky moments (few slightly clever moments, but nothing really stand out) despite the signature Chucky laughs. The death scenes are also bland this time around. The first installment had parts that didn't make much sense, there is actually a lot of those moments in this one. The plot didn't really seem to have a sense of direction. It basically revolves around Andy's life after the event of the first film while he is paranoid of Chucky. And nobody believing him when it came to his stories. The premise and relationships seemed to have more development this time around. When the final act kicks in though in the toy factory things start to pick up for the better. While the first one tried to go in a more serious horror direction this one lightens up a bit which I am not quite sure if it's a good thing or not. All in all this is a alright sequel with few clever Chucky moments and few laughs because of Andy's reactions (although I am not sure if it was intentional or not).

After murdering several people, the evil doll was burnt to a crisp and dismembered by Andy's mother which effectively put an end to his crimes. No one believed Andy's mom and she was taken away to a mental correction facility for her crazy story. The now eight year old Andy has since been placed into a new home with foster parents Phil Simpson (Gerrit Graham), Joanne Simpson (Jenny Agutter), and their adoptive daughter Kyle (Christine Elise). Meanwhile, Chucky has been reconstructed by the company that manufactures the Good Guy dolls in order to prove a point. Knowing that Andy is his only means of becoming human again, the murderous doll immediately goes after the poor boy and will kill anyone who gets in his way! I will never understand the bad things that I sometimes hear about this sequel, it's great! Sure the first film is way scarier and more suspenseful but here we see way more of Chucky and his one liners, which are both cruel and hilarious. Most of the adults in this film are very unlikable and I've heard people complain about that, but it makes it all the more satisfying when they meet their fate at the hands of Chucky! The killer doll is once again voiced by Brad Dourif, who is a huge favorite of mine and never fails to deliver those lines with such wicked devotion. No one can ever replace Brad and you can tell he loves being the voice of Chucky. Alex Vincent is also on top of his game here as Andy from the first film and delivers a structured and layered performance. He has great chemistry with Christine Elise who plays Kyle, his foster sister. This sequel has some of the best kills of the whole series and I also love the action-packed finale in the toy factory. This movie isn't quite as good as the original but I will still give it a perfect rating as seeing more of Chucky is always a good thing. I'll never get over his side splitting comment about women drivers towards the end of the movie, funny stuff! Long live Chucky!

He tracks down Andy played by Alex Vincent and finds out that his mother(sadly not seen at all in the movie) was sent to a mental institute after defending her sons story about a killer doll. Andy goes to live with a foster family but after multiple mishaps involving the killer doll and the death of his foster dad(Guess Who?) Andy is sent back to foster care where Chucky takes him and his foster sister Kyle(Hey that's my name!) hostage and takes them to a toy factory for a climax that is now infamous in the horror community.The problems I have with this film are 2 very minor things. The first is the story. It feels like it is trying to be a copy of the first film just in a different story(I'm looking at you The Hangover Part II). The second is the doll effects. The special effects for the doll still look good but they feel a little lacking in comparison.Now onto the good stuff. First I like how Andy is now sent into foster care because it gives him new people to interact with. Now even though I complained about the mother not being in the film, I am glad that there are new people because if the mother was in here than this would be a blatant copy of the first film.Next the acting. Alex Vincent still does a good job but feels a Little stale than the first one. Of course Brad Dourif is fantastic as the voice of Chucky. The foster family does an o.k. job, and thats about the main cast of the film.Lastly the climax of the film which takes place in a toy factory. My favorite film critic that is not based online, Roger Ebert and his colleague the late Gene Siskel stated that they thought this was a poor film but praised the last 15 minutes. The last 15 minutes are the best because it takes place in a giant toy factory where Chucky could be anywhere.The final verdict for Child's Play 2 is 3 1/2 stars out of 4, and it does earn my seal of approval which is earned by films that earn 3.5 or 4 stars. The films had good acting, a new setting which does work out and of course the 15 minute climax in the toy factory is the cherry on top of the sundae.

Obviously this sequel was very rushed and came when it shouldn't. Spending more time on a script and another choice for director could've helped this to become a decent sequel. **SPOILERS** After the traumatic events of part 1, Andy Barclay is separated from his mother and both are under psychological treatment. Then Andy is settled with an adoptive family formed by Mr. and Mrs. Simpson and Kyle, an orphan troubled girl also adopted by the Simpsons. Police denied Andy and his mother's version of the events and close the case making the events of the original movie as non existent. Executives and the President of the Good Guy company needed an official explanation in order to shut down rumors spread by tabloids about a possessed Good Guy doll. Engineers of the company explore and repair the rests of the supposedly possessed doll and do not find any abnormality. Suddenly lightning strikes the doll and one of the producing engineers gets electrocuted and dies. Chucky is resurrected that way and once again starts his search for Andy in order to get his soul out of the body and pass it on Andy's.Chucky manages to enter Andy's new house and subsequently his life. Nobody believes Andy when he says that Chucky is alive and living inside the house, but when things start to get a little ugly after Mr. Simpson's death, only Kyle realizes the boy is telling the truth. Kyle and Chucky escape from Chucky after a series of events and persecutions and end up in the Good Guy factory. The climatic ending leads Andy and Kyle blowing up Chucky's body (or what it's left of it). You have to watch it for specific details, it's a very weird death.This time Chucky kills Andy's school teacher, Mr. and Mrs. Simpson, a Good Guy exec., a Good Guy worker, Tommy (a Good Guy doll), and a woman of the family center. ACTING. In this field the best is Alex Vincent's performance. He's a very cute boy still and this time his performance is stronger than in the first movie. He had potential to become a child star. Kyle's performance is okay, and her beautiness helps a lot. Brad Dourif's voice is still excellent and gives Chucky a personality. The other actors are regular and makes us miss Mr. Sarandon and Catherine Hicks. DIRECTION. Boring and tries to copy Tom Holland's. This movie is not attractive for the eye and is just one of the bunch of early 90's crappy horror movies. F/X. Chucky has more screen time but sadly it's not as good as in part 1. Remember, quantity is not quality. The gore is okay and Chucky's death is somewhat good in the gore field. SCORE. Regular. Nothing you haven't seen.Watch Child's Play 2 only if you are a big fan of Chucky. I'm not a huge fan but I enjoy his movies; I'm a big fan of the original Child's Play movie, not because of Chucky. As a child I like all of the Chucky movies the same, but not that I can say I enjoy good horror I realize the best of the bunch is Child's Play. Sequels shouldn't be spawned after the original IMO. After the superior Child's Play, the franchise turned into horror/comedy movies with a Chucky that would crack one liners a la Freddy Krueger.

And he's angrier, and more sadistic, and wielding more corny one-liners than ever. All Chucky fans remember that he was burnt to a toasty crisp in the first movie. However in order to dispel rumors that Chucky ever came to life, the business that makes the Good-Guy Dolls decides to preposterously rebuild him, and show the public nothing is wrong with the doll. When they do this, Chucky comes back to life and sets out to find Andy Barclay (Alex Vincent). The kid he needs to voodoo in order to come back to life as a human. Chucky finds Andy in the hands of his new foster parents Phil (Gerrit Graham) and Joann (Jenny Agutter), and a stepsister Kyle (Christine Elise).

Until the crazy, psychotic doll begins running out of time to turn human again, and sadistically murders anyone in his way of Andy.First things first, the original Child's Play is a campy classic, Child's Play 2 is not. Whereas the original had a way of composing itself with fine suspense and acting, which helped shut out the corniness of its doll-come-to-life plot. This utterly puke-inducing sequel has no way to take itself seriously at all. It happens in a lot of horror films with a lead slasher. Freddy Kruegger fell victim to crappy one-liners, Jason Voorhees turned out to be a frady-cat loser as a kid (Freddy Vs. Jason), and even Michael Myers got his butt kicked by Busta Rhymes. The only slightly creepy thing about Child's Play 2 is the ending, which takes place in the Good-Guys Doll Factory. But that can't save this ludicrously over-the-top slasher sequel. The acting is mild, the script only gets creative with the kills, and even the kills are more unsettling than scary.The few parts where Chucky kills somebody go too far over the top, to the point where you almost (or may) laugh at them. While they were a bit creative, I was repulsed by them in every imaginable way. There is a random, grotesque kill where Chucky pushes an innocent man onto a conveyor belt, and he is killed when doll eyes are punched into his face. It's scenes like this that, while creepy, really cross the line. Horror fans may enjoy a movie with nasty kills. But for me there has to be something to back it up, or it's just a senseless kill. I think it's absolutely disgusting how Hollywood glorifies murder on screen nowadays. It's only gotten progressively worse over the years after Child's Play 2. This review is being written in 2008, and the theaters are filled with Saw, Hostel, and more torture, torture, torture! I don't understand why people are so intrigued by gore. What fascinates audiences so much with it that it makes big money in ticket sales? A person gets killed on screen and there's no tragedy, but yet everyone gets upset and mourns when someone dies in real life. There's a word for that and it's called Hypocrite.Child's Play 2 is an awful horror film. The poster art is scarier than the movie itself. Chucky did not deserve to have a horror series because in my opinion he's one of the worst horror icons since the evil killer Leprechaun. However I do have to give it points for its eery, creepy playtime atmosphere (such as the doll factory scene). I give Child's Play 2 a 1 out of 4.

Chucky 2 is the beginning of the process to turn Child's Play to another classic Slasher series and establish his status as equal to Freddie or Jason. In my opinion - it failed miserably.In order for the process to set off on the right foot, the sequel has to at least top the original, which Child's Play 2 absolutely doesn't. I realize we're talking about a film that had been released 26 years ago, but understanding that bluntly stupid characters damage a film's effect (and reputation) isn't a 21st century notion. It's a doll, but it's becoming more and more human in regards to vulnerability. You have to destroy it's heart. Say it with me Destroy. The. Heart. Chucky is menacing, frightening and evil, and is quite strong seeing as how it's a doll possessed by the soul of a deranged serial killer, but it's still a doll. Burn it to the ground, chop it to pieces with an axe, drop it into a tub full of acid, do something! Anything to make sure the heart is destroyed, if you're unable to stab it or shoot it! No. Instead, Alex Vincent (who's still unauthentic and unconvincing) and Jenny Agutter (also unimpressive, even in late 80's standards) insist on doing anything but actually killing the doll, regardless to countless opportunities and the fact Andy knows how to kill it, having witnessed his mother's past attempts. The plot and screenplay are completely irrelevant, since the entire film revolves around Chucky's superiority and his magical ability to completely disarm people of their logic and intellect.The good part? Chucky is adorable and hilarious (just what you want out of a Horror villain, right?). His facial expressions, trying to be more vicious and scary this time, reminded me of Mr. Marshmallow Man from Ghostbusters. Not a good sign considering this was supposed to be a scary movie. Also, making Chucky a comically cynical bastard in the footsteps of Freddie is nothing more than an unoriginal imitation. My fault, I know. I'm watching a kids film when I'm old enough to be a father. Still. This film isn't suitable for children (as it would scare them too much), and is a joke to adults. If you watch it, it would probably be for the 1000th time, but if you're a first timer - do yourself a favour, and go watch A Nightmare on Elm Street or Friday the 13th. Child's Play is a bust.

The first is the 'improvement' sequel that strives to outdo its predecessor &#x96; films like TERMINATOR 2, ALIENS and THE DARK KNIGHT fall into this category, one of my favourites. The second is the 'rip-off' sequel, the sole reason for which is to make money. These films typically rehash the plot from the first movie without adding anything new to the blend and look like nothing more than bland imitators. Sadly, CHILD'S PLAY 2 is the latter type of sequel, a weak imitation of the first movie lacking the same originality, narrative thrust and enjoyment.Things kick off at a toy factory where some manufacturers inexplicably revive Chucky, who was burned to a cinder at the end of the last flick. Soon enough he's back up and running, stalking Andy Barclay. What follows is in essence a series of cheesy deaths people are stabbed, fall to their deaths, get electrocuted and in one instance are killed by a ruler. Unfortunately such moments feel tired and drawn out and this is a film that feels like it's in search of a plot. The only thing that holds it together is Brad Dourif, having a ball once more as the voice of Chucky. Alex Vincent also returns from the first but he seems more morose and restrained there; either he was bored with the role or told to act' subdued'.With Alex's mother written out of the movie, we're introduced to a bland foster couple &#x96; there's nothing much to get out of the sheer boredom of these guys, which is a shame because two cult favourites play them; Gerrit Graham and Jenny Agutter, both wasted with nothing of what made them so memorable in the first place. The cheesy, extended finale is more yawn-inducing than inspiring this time around, as we've already seen all the Chucky-isn't-dead-is-he scares. Special effects are adequate but the low budget is apparent in many scenes, especially the non-starter of a car crash which is laughably bad. In all this is a worthless remake in a series filled with pretty uninteresting, undeserving films; apparently the rushed-out sequel is even worse. Stay tuned...

What really works here is pretty much a lot of what worked in the original in being reliant on whether the doll is alive or not, managing to some pretty fun times here in keeping the truth hidden quite a long time here. Not only does this one have the trauma inflicted from the original, but there's a lot of retread here in the first half of copying tactics where he does something that ends up framing the kid for what happened, making for some rather decent times with the broken statue, his teacher at school and finally the incident in his bedroom where he's found tied-up with Chucky and no possible way he did it to himself which makes the eventual stumbling across it quite nicely done here. While none of these have the power of the original, they give this a solid- enough start here that when this one turns into a slasher there's some great parts already on display with this one. Starting with the teacher in her classroom and the father in the basement, there's some great stalking scene that make this one quite fun as the kidnapping from the orphanage and resulting car chase to rescue him leads into the grand final half. The utterly freaky stalking in the factory upon hundreds of boxes of dolls, the various stalking around the conveyor belts s they barely manage to escape him each time, the fine kills and lastly the triple-stacked measures needed to finally put him down give this one plenty of action, some nice suspense when necessary and a bit of cheese to make this one interesting enough that it's not all that stale throughout. These here are good enough even with a few minor problems. The main one is that it tends to feel very much like the original as it plays with the same overall set-up, just not quite as powerful at doing so. The other factor against this one is the rather noticeable lack of kills here in the first half as it keeps the truth hidden away during this time so it keeps the body count a little undervalued in this section. Beyond these small facets, there's a lot to like here.Rated R Graphic Violence, Graphic Language, children-in-jeopardy and underage drug use.

For a film only 84 minutes long, it really packs quite a punch. The plot itself isn't all too impressive, however the film's impact lies in its execution.Stefan Czapsky's photography is effectively claustrophobic, and makes great use of an elaborate, eye-poppingly colorful set design to make the film look painfully cheerful and eerie. Graeme Revell's score is difficult to describe. It is a good score, however, coming off of Joe Renzetti's creepy electronic score for the previous film, this frenzied, overwrought orchestra is more in the vein of Christopher Young's 'Hellraiser' scores and would be better suited for a film of that series as opposed to 'Chucky'. It is, at times, overtly sinister.These, combined with John Lafia's over-the-top directing style make for an action-packed, visually pleasing, and profoundly uncomfortable viewing experience. It feels like the movie was made with the direct intention of frightening children out of their wits. Or like Tim Burton attempting a horror movie. "},{"Title":"Chucky Wanna play? Me Sorry, not so much this time.","Date":"13 June 2012","Score":"","Genre":"Fantasy, Horror","Review":" This unnecessary, but inevitable, sequel to Tom Holland's surprisingly nifty original serves as a somewhat logical continuation of the events of the first film, but despite Chucky's frequent and insistent outbursts of maniacal glee, Child's Play 2 isn't ultimately all that much fun.Last seen as a charred plastic doll-corpse, Chucky is made pristine once again by a team of witless toy company executives, who conveniently restore his damaged frame good as new in an effort to prove that the scenario in the first movie couldn't possibly have taken place (this is one of many dicey plot issues you'll have to overlook if you have any prayer of making it through this film). Of course, this make-over brings Chucky raring to life (with the ability to shoot electricity out of his eyes, naturally) and sets him free to embark on another killing spree.The story follows returning friend to the end Andy as he is shuttled to a foster home while his absent mother undergoes a psychiatric evaluation. The ever-resourceful Chucky very quickly tracks Andy down and resumes his quest to transfer his soul into the lad's body, knocking off a few random victims along the way, and the film quickly settles into the same nobody believes me motif that we saw the first time out.Andy's foster guardians are predictably clueless, and they even keep another Good Guy doll around the house despite their pre-awareness of that precise toy's status as the root of Andy's trauma. Like most of the characters in the film, they exist primarily to provide a body count, though the deaths here are notably tepid and bloodless, and in some cases downright silly (Chucky dispatches a disciplinarian teacher by beating her to death with a ruler, duh-dun-dun).Kevin Yagher's Chucky effects are as excellent as they were the first go around, and while I'm not sure how the mechanical puppetry will resonate with modern audiences used to lazy CGI trickery, those who relish the days when special effects were created by skilled and imaginative craftsmen instead of computers will marvel at how effectively Yagher's team brings our cuddly killer to life. It's fitting that Chucky is the best thing about this outing, but since his presence was augmented by a tight story and well-orchestrated suspense elements in the original Child's Play, watching him simply go through the motions here isn't nearly as engaging as we've already witnessed it could be. Despite the rich camp value inherent in the material (later explored to much more satisfying effect in future installments), Child's Play 2 is an oddly mirthless affair, and only one of the sight gags (which is, subsequently, literally a sight gag) provides a modicum of the gallows humor rampant in this film's predecessor. The rest of the movie's attempts at bits are a tad too self-aware to be clever and largely fall flat as a result. While I'm certainly not arguing that we should expect brilliant bon mots in a sequel to a film about a homicidal doll, a bit more levity beyond Chucky's mostly droll one-liners would have been refreshing here.A rare Emily Valentine sighting (if you get the reference, you'll enjoy her presence immensely) provides a minor point of interest, but unfortunately I don't have too many other reasons to recommend this film. Even the overlong and unexciting climax fails to generate any real thrills, and since we already know going in that Child's Play 3 is on the horizon, Chucky's concluding comeuppance doesn't have a whole lot of impact.Child's Play 2 isn't unwatchable, but it does offer up only the most paltry of reasons to justify its own existence. You'll assuredly have a bit of fun along the way, but I simply can't conclude that the meager morsels being dished out here are worth 83 minutes of your life.

I knew that going into Child's Play 2, I was thinking two things at the time; 1. I knew it wasn't going to be better than the first one and 2. I knew that I was still going to love it.The story is quite solid as it is a straight-forward, very disturbing take on, where Andy is taken away from his mother, put into a foster home with an absurd woman named Joanne, her husband who is a twit called Phil and then the most coolest, absurd like teenager, Kyle. From here on, the Good Guy Doll company decide to remake the doll to prove there was nothing wrong with it at all. But once he's remade, the soul of evil mass-voodoo murderer, Charles Lee Ray comes back to life and seems to find poor little Andy, where he starts the terror again, only this time toying and torturing poor little Andy.I think that it was an excellent sequel. Even though it doesn't have the impact of the original, it still kept me in watch mode.The music score which becomes quite chilling and circus like by Graeme Revell is well scored and structured, where it is all paced well. Alex Vincent is Andy is still quite convincing and he seems to to still be in his roll, only though this time, his character seems to become more frustrated when no one believes him about Chucky trying to get him. The other actors all did an excellent job at their roles, very dramatic I must say.Although everyone was good, the real credit goes to Brad Dourif who pulled the voice off well. He seems to bring a more surreal humor to the doll this time, which I think is a nice touch as in the first one, he becomes quite scary and creepy. I also like how they made him look a bit different, to keep up with the time span (being two years apart).I also think setting it in a foster home and later a factory, doesn't strand too far away. Not like what Bride or Seed did, where they took the action everywhere. I think in order for a Chucky film to work, it has to remain in one or two places.One little problem I have is that this film, like the next three Chucky films do NOT have the impact like the first film. For some reason, I just loved the first film and I seem to always find myself watching that one the most. These sequels although done well, I just don't find them as memorable. But it really doesn't matter with Child's Play 2, because even though it doesn't reach the potential like the original, it generally works very well, where the viewer can become distressed because of what Chucky does to poor Andy in this one.Overall, a great sequel that has it's dark and disturbing moments.8/10 "},{"Title":"not as good as the first one but its a worthy sequel","Date":"24 March 2012","Score":"","Genre":"Fantasy, Horror","Review":" this was a alright follow up of the original child's play movie it's more violent and the language is rough.chucky the killer doll is rebuild and he decides to track down his target Andy Barclay so he can steal his soul. there's one scene i found to be very disturbing when chucky is in Andy bed he has him tied up and he tells Andy how much he missed him,that scene made feel so uncomfortable Lol.Andy is now in a foster home because his mom was put in a mental hospital for blaming chucky for the murders in the previous film.this movie is faced paced and we see chucky talk more. the body count is higher and the kills were very creative.

While I did enjoy it, I felt that the switch from suspense picture to slasher film was done far too awkwardly and not smooth enough. The first half of the film had a sense of reality to it that made it quite creepy and bizarre while the second half was more of a by-the-numbers slasher film. The first film was well-made, but it's flaws made it a bit more of a mess than I would have liked it to be. I just really didn't find the idea of a killer doll to be that scary to be honest. It's not that hard to just pick up a doll by it's feet and smash it on the pavement. How could such a silly premise sustain an entire franchise? I didn't have high hopes for the sequel, needless to say. However, having seen the second film, I'm going to have to eat my words about a killer doll not possibly being scary. This film was really quite terrifying at times! It's about the boy, Andy, from the first film being moved into foster care while the doll from the first film is put back together and unleashed back into the poor child's life. Unlike the first film, however, the doll immediately goes on a killing rampage without wasting any time. Needless to say, there is plenty of splatter and plenty of gore in store for the audience.This is probably one of the goriest slasher films I've seen. Sure, it's no MANIAC(1980), but it is a really sick and foul piece of film-making with a lot of mean-spirited nastiness and cruelty, and it has no shame! One of the things I disliked about the original was that it didn't go far enough. However, this CHILD'S PLAY film goes all the way in it's depiction of a mad killer on the loose. There are some truly frightening and heartless scenes throughout, but it's all done so effectively and with such imagination and depravity that it comes off perfect. The performances even seem better too! Alex Vincent's portrayal of Andy is startling in it's emotional impact. Christine Elise is also very strong as the Kyle character as is Jenny Agutter as the foster mom.While I can't recommend the film to the squeamish, I can safely say that if you are a horror fan and you're in the mood for a truly sick and wild gorefest of a slasher film, CHILD'S PLAY 2 is definitely a must-see. It may not be everyone's cup of tea, but CHILD'S PLAY 2 definitely satisfied my bloodlust and managed to creep me out and chill me to the bone all the same. Definitely a must-see for fans of the macabre and the crazy. Be prepared for one hell of a scene involving a conveyor belt!

He starts to show some of his famous humor here and is actually able to make people laugh as he kills or causes destruction. The first movie had little or no comedy in it but was able to be very eerie. This movie isn't very eerie at all but is a little funny. The actors were OK for the most part, none really bad. But Chucky was definitely the highlight of this movie. I give this a 6/10, and don't worry if you don't enjoy this movie, I will honestly say it's probably the low-point of the series.

Often named one of the best sequels to a film, the premise is of a company trying to renew the popularity of the Good Guy dolls after the poor publicity of Andy Barclay's claims that the doll was killing folk. Why on earth they do this is beyond me but they take the charred remains of the doll possessed by Charles LeRay, scrape off the ashes and burned plastic and send the dolls back into production using the Chucky dolls their prototype.So Chucky escapes the clutches of the toy makers and works on finding Andy because Andy was the first person he told his secret to...and that means in voodoo world that he is the only one that Charles can put his soul into. Meanwhile, Andy is put with a foster family and has actually learned to be friendly with a new Good Guy Doll. Easy pickings and Chucky does away with Andy's new doll and moves in for the kill. So Andy discovers Chucky is back soon enough and once again...nobody believes him. So we get a much more action packed movie with Chucky on the prowl once again and Andy fleeing him all the while. The film ends up for an excellent finale in the toy factory that isn't to be missed. Classic scene from this film is Chucky's use of the middle finger from the back of a big rig with Kyle (Christine Elise) in pursuit. I've always gotten a kick out of that. This movie is right on par with the first film "},{"Title":"Another blooper for Chucky 2! and my thoughts on it.","Date":"7 August 2007","Score":"","Genre":"Fantasy, Horror","Review":" Another blooper that they missed was when Kyle was going through the machine where they put the eyes in the good guy dolls she gasps and goes back and when it comes down it puts eyes in a good guy but on the shot before you can clearly see that there was no doll in front of her to put eyes in. My thoughts on this movie are good. The movie graphics were excellent for 1990 and a great sequel to the awesome Child's Play movie in 1988. Chucky is basically brought back to life by the company. Even though I loved this movie why would they want to rebuild that one doll that could just be out of there lives forever that almost ruined the company when they have tons of dolls already made? It doesn't make much sense when you think about it.

It was released by Universal City Studios on November 9, 1990, exactly two years after the predecessor. There is less of a structured plot than in the original, and Chucky has more of a witty character than before.The film was regarded as being widely successful for a horror film, in its opening weekend - it took an estimated $10,718,520, with only 1,996 screens in the United States. The film grossed an estimated $28,501,605 in the US and was declared a hit. The movie flopped overseas and only grossed $7.2 million.9/10 "},{"Title":"An entertaining movie that can't live up to the original","Date":"10 January 2007","Score":"","Genre":"Fantasy, Horror","Review":" In Child's Play 2 we see the return of Chucky, a doll possessed by the soul of Chicago killer Charles Lee Ray (Dourif). It seems that after the first installment of the series, Chucky's potential victim, Andy (Vincent) was placed temporarily into an orphanage while his mother underwent psychiatric evaluation. We learn that police witnesses involved in the first film decided not to press charges against Good Guy Dolls, the company responsible for the manufacturing of toys like Chucky. However, the executives at Good Guy are up in arms over negative tabloid reports and have reassembled Chucky to study it. One thing leads to another, Chucky escapes and goes to find Andy, the one person whose body he can cast himself into by the use of voodoo.Ahh, a time where the Child's Play series was still trying to be scary. I can remember watching Child's Play 2 late at night on USA at a young impressionable age, something which my parents would have prohibited if they had known how determined I was to watch scary movies. Although the movie doesn't do much to frighten me now, this flick scared the crap out of me back then. Chucky becomes much more of a featured character in this sequel. Unlike the first film which opted to keep Chucky in the shadows for most of the first half, we see the character interacting in the environment. While this lessens any tension or mystery about Chucky, it gives Brad Dourif the chance to talk more and spit out continuous one-liners and obscenities. Without Dourif, this movie would have lost major points with me.The special effects in Child's Play 2 are one area in which the production crew topped the original. Especially considering the time in which it was made, it is amazing how they were able to show Chucky walking around and interacting so freely with the environment. His movements are very smooth and realistic. After a while, it is easy to forget that there is even a special effects crew operating the doll.Although movies like this have a reputation for sub par acting, there are actually a few fine performances in Child's Play 2 that stand out. Alex Vincent continues to be effective as Andy Barclay. He comes off very real and avoids any child star overacting, known in my book as Jake Lloydisms. Unfortunately, this time his role doesn't require him to do much more than look concerned, nervous, and sometimes scared. I felt he was much more developed and explored in the original. Also, Jenny Agutter, of An American Werewolf in London fame, gives a strong performance as a caring foster mother.Nevertheless, there is some lousy acting here. While Christine Elise is not bad as Andy's foster sister Kyle, her reactions and overall display of emotion are pretty flat. I mean, the girl doesn't seem to be too blown away by the fact that there is a killer doll trying to kill her. In a scene where Chucky commands her to drive faster, she casually asks him with mild annoyance what his hurry is? I had the same issue with the Good Guy exec that Chucky holds up in the beginning. This is a talking, walking, killing doll that houses the spirit of a dead criminal! Why does this fail to amaze you? Ultimately, this movie fails to live up to the expectations that the original instilled in audiences. Whereas the first movie played like a supernatural crime thriller, Child's Play 2 feels comfortable with settling into pre-existing slasher clichés. The simplistic plot leaves much to be desired. Chucky escapes, finds Andy, causes trouble which gets blamed on Andy, kills some characters which have death written boldly in red on their forehead, and isolates the obvious survivor(s) in a showdown. It's a progression that can be predicted well before viewing. There is also the ever predictable stalk sequence where the protagonist is looking for Chucky, the music is builds to a crescendo, he pulls something aside expecting to see the doll right as the music climaxes, he sees nothing, sighs in a relief to make the audience think he's not there, and then crazy old Chucky dives out from another spot, in effect causing the music to soar to new heights.Also, why are there so many characters that seem out to get Andy? The foster father (Graham) seems only moderately sorry for leaving a Good Guy doll in his adoptive son's closest, even when he knows about Andy's history with the company. OK, I guess we can let that one slip. But does remove the doll from the house? No! Like a jackass, he decides that he can break Andy's irrational fear of the doll by keeping it around the house. Also, the teacher irked me. What kind of person teaches a first grade class like that? I particularly enjoyed the part where she keeps Andy after for detention, something that usually isn't bestowed on children that young. If that wasn't bad enough, she proceeds to lock Andy in the classroom with Chucky while she calls his house. I realize that the actions of these characters exist to advance the plot, but couldn't they have made the characters better-rounded and less static? But all in all, Child's Play 2 isn't a bad movie. It's not great, it doesn't top the original, but it is entertaining as hell. Sure this film had about as many false endings as Lord of the Rings Return of the King, but that seems to be a Chucky tradition. If you are older than fifteen, don't expect to be scared too much. Nevertheless, if you are looking for a light-hearted horror movie with dark humor, you can't go wrong. Brad Dourif as the voice of Chucky alone justifies the price of the DVD purchase or rental.

One of the reasons this sequel is the best is because of the unique and outstanding set designs and colors. Along with Suspiria, this is one of the most colorful horror films I've ever seen. The climax that takes place in a toy factory is terrific. The factory itself is like something out of a child's imagination. The film is filled with mainly bright bold colors and they stick out so much that I think this actually plays a part in giving you nightmares the same night you watch this film.

Now let's move on to the stupid doll company. How pathetic is this? They decided to put the doll back together to see if it is really evil. How stupid is that? What's the point? So now, Chucky is alive again, and he has to get his soul into Andy's body blah blah blah. The death scenes in this movie are flat out funny. There is actually a scene, where this 3 foot doll, beats a full grown adult woman to death with a wooden YARD STICK! Alright people, that's just impossible. If your hitting this person that hard, then the yardstick is going to break after about the third or fourth time, and if your not hitting them that hard, then your not hitting them hard enough to kill them. And another thing, what happened to the kid who played Andy??? He did such a good job in the first film. No wonder they decided not to bring him back in the next one.

Although it ended with a bravura climax with the demise of Chucky, the infamous killer doll, its buildup was slow and brooding. The result was to generate a degree of ambiguity regarding the truth about the situation. Was he really killing people, or were the murders the work of a sick little boy? There was a real sense of dread that made the film more of a dark fantasy than a straight horror movie. However, when the inevitable sequels came out, there was no need to adhere to this approach. The reality of Chucky's presence had been firmly established, so all that was left to do was to go all-out, to jump right in the action. Child's Play 2 accomplishes its goals on that basis.It's silly, but slick and entertaining. There are at least a few gaping plot holes, but it doesn't really matter. The film was made to simply give us a good ride, and it generally manages to accomplish that. I just didn't care too much about whether or not it made sense. Just accept it as one of these pop a can and enjoy movies. Director John Lafia knows the material can't be taken seriously, so he goes heavy on the style and treats us to a fast-paced film with plenty of showoff camerawork. In fact, it's arguably more immediately entertaining than the original, though the writing simply isn't as good--a few more twists would have helped a bit. The highlight is a thrill-a-minute doll factory climax.Alex Vincent was a solid child actor, and it's a shame his career never took off after the first two Child's Play films. A lot of movies, particularly in the horror genre, have grappled with the problem of annoying kids, but if nothing, Child's Play 2 avoided falling victim to that unfortunate curse. Gerrit Graham adds very good support, outdoing his young colleague. His character, the foster dad, isn't too likable, but his matter-of-fact presence lends a degree of reality to the fantastic happenings. Christine Elise, as the foster sister, doesn't quite hit the bull's-eye, but she gives it her best shot. At first her character was obnoxious, but she eventually becomes more sympathetic and drops the nonsense. Finally, Brad Dourif delivers another warped Chucky voice performance.

In Child's Play 2, you get to see Chucky move around and talk a lot more, plus some of his famous one liners are created in this movie. The way Chucky is brought back to life is kind of sketchy. I mean, why would they re-build that exact doll? And how? He was burned to a crisp. But oh well, sometimes ya gotta suspend disbelief to create sequels (Hey, Michael Myers' head was chopped off in H20, but the sucker is still alive). Chucky continues his murderous rampage and also continues his stalking of little Andy so he can transfer his soul into the little brat before it's too late and he's stuck as a doll for the rest of his life. The body count rises as does the volume of blood used. This is simple sequel math, folks. Chucky is really funny in this movie, and he is so sadistic and just goes off killing people for the sake of killing people. His personality has improved a lot. Brad Dourif returns to do the vocals for Chucky and he does a wonderful job with it, as he does in all the Child's Play movies. He really makes Chucky who he is.

Now he passes the director's chair over to the co-screenwriter of the first film John Lafia to bring us the rest of the story. Child's Play 2 starts off rather well with a nice little Chucky reconstruction sequence and a really wonderful 'killing the guy from Ally Mcbeal' sequence. It also has a nice ANDY Barkley foster child routine going on as well. Others might say that this film is a BOMB, but I tend to disagree. If most of you will pay close attention, this film is where the humor starts kicking in and the films start moving slowly towards a more comic angle. The laughs aren't as frequent in this one as in 1998's 'Bride of Chucky', but their still rather conspicuous, which is very good. This film's supposed to be a horror movie, not a comedy alone. The comedy is supposed to be in the form of Comic Relief, not bitter unrelenting Comic suffocation. John Lafia balances the two genres brilliantly in this chapter so as a result Chucky is at his best. Brad Dourif (Chucky) is only appearing as the doll in this film but he handles the dubs perfectly (Infact, and I don't want to go off subject here, I believe that his portrayal of the killer toy is what held the entire series together) Yes, Critics may disagree but I believe that this has to be the best of the series. It has a more funhouse cinimatic style to it that the original film - or the other sequels - plus more darkly comic interludes (and Greame Revell's haunting score). If you want to watch any of the SEQUELS, Watch THIS ONE.(don't listen to any of that crappy 'false shocks' criticism. It's not the shocks that keep you hooked. It's CHUCKY... and his sharp utencils.)

A good way to fix that would have been to have Chucky somehow kill the two cops at the end of the first movie, but I guess it's too late for that.  Alex Vincent, who played Andy in each of the first two movies, seems worse in this one than he did in the first, almost like he had some acting talent then lost it.  He just seems so... sleepy or something.  Sure he seems a little bit stronger now, but he should be a little smarter than he was in the first movie.  Brad Dourif is great once again as Chucky.  Brad gives Chucky his own personality, and I'm sure that if Chucky were voiced by someone else the movies wouldn't be half as good as they are.

The problem is that Chucky is shown during the killings. This is a problem because when we're supposed to be cringing, we're laughing. The first did this perfectly because we only saw a silhouette of the doll, nothing else (sans the third act). If the doll HAD to be shown, maybe less screen time and witty jabs? Moreover, I had more fun when the film tried on different hats. For an example, the scenes between Andy and the other foster child, and how the values like family, trust, etc. are put to test. That alone made for an interesting character background, and I would've preferred to have that relationship carry on throughout the film as the doll slashed his way from victim to victim.The highly-talked about toy factory sequence does not disappoint either. The gore is amped up to about infinity, the races are on, and that's pretty much when the sh*t hits the fan. Too bad the whole film didn't have that spark. What would've made Child's Play 2 a more taut film? Dispose of the whole no one believes Andy subplot. It happened the first time, it just gets more been-there-done-that as it continues to happen. Furthermore, develop Andy and the foster child (as I previously stated). And less screen time on Chucky would pay off in spades. All in all, this is not a bad sequel. This movie could've gone in much worse directions as its future sequels (the abysmal Seed of Chucky), but they should've just scrapped the material. The first by itself would've made for a terrific little thriller. Now that it's a franchise, all appeal is lost.

Also there is an attitude that regards children in this movie that is just as cynical, the adults never believe our child hero, force him to conform to their rules and basically never give him any credit. These adults are throughly unlikable and clearly deserve their medicine which The Chuckster delivers by the spoonful. The teacher in particular is a cold hearted and viscous type that make a student feel stupid or make a child feel worthless. So watching Chucky dispatch her becomes quite perverse pleasure. Also of note is the adults who cheat on their wives, live in a museum of a house and basically in general care more about appearances than actually being parents. One is never convinced that the step-parents ever adopt Alex Vincent out of love but rather for appearances sake. In fact when Chucky takes apart the family unit, it speaks volumes that he destroys one of their priceless artifacts to add insult to injury. Even better is when Chucky chases the duo in the climax, where he takes on an imposing edge not seen in the series. As many have noted Chucky comes off as an adult figure and it is clearly these scenes that make this the best of the series. A fascinating effort to be sure.* * * out of 4-(Good) "},{"Title":"Outstanding horror film you'll love which will leave you feeling good","Date":"25 November 2005","Score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Fantasy, Horror","Review":" CHILD'S PLAY 2, in my opinion, is an outstanding horror film you'll love which will leave you feeling good.

None of the sequels really offered anything that the original didn't and thus they became rather boring movies.Following the bad publicity of the &#145;Good Guy' doll after the Andy Barclay (Alex Vincent) became public knowledge the aforementioned doll was removed from sale. Naturally nobody believes that the doll murdered anybody (Andy's mother is now institutionalised for backing her son's story up in court) but they do believe that Andy was somehow disturbed by his Good Guy doll &#145;Chucky'. Rumours have floated about that the internal tape may have been changed. The company that makes the &#145;Good Guy' dolls have decided to reintroduce their product and to quell concerns over the dolls the doll containing the spirit of Charles Lee Ray, the notorious Lakeshore strangler, is manually re-assembled. Unfortunately the spirit of Charles aka Chucky is still resident and he once again resumes his quest to regain a human body, which puts the now fostered Andy in trouble once again.There's a little more bloodshed, a few more victims and more screen time for Chucky but all in all this movie is not particularly fulfilling. Fans of the original may be impressed by the extra screen time for the foul-mouthed, murdering toy Chucky, but on subsequent viewings the movie no longer stands up. The plot leaves a lot to be desired and the characters all seem rather wooden and unrealistic. A pre-&#145;Beverly Hills 90210' Christine Elise plays Kyle, the only character in the movie that may garner any audience sympathy and respect and even she seems dull and contrived throughout the movie. &#145;Child's Play 2' had no input from original creator Tom Holland and it certainly shows through as the general direction and execution of this movie is poor. The final ten minutes or so of the film are the only moments that really seem to shine through but this is too little, too late from writer Don Mancini and director John Lafia. Other than the finale it's just a far too logical next step from the original and tries too hard to capture the good parts of that movie without trying to improve upon them. A little more humour is added to the mix but still the movie offers nothing of any real distinction to be a satisfactory sequel.

Sure, but it's a horrible experience to go through","Date":"23 January 2010","Score":"4 out of 8 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Fantasy, Horror","Review":" 'Child's Play 2' is a tough movie to review. It is well directed, well acted, and hits all the targets. On the other hand it is a movie I felt unclean watching. The idea of Chucky has lost what ever originality it had in the original film. Instead we get a genuinely evil character torturing a poor little boy for the film. I honestly think you'd have to be mentally ill to find entertainment in 'Child's Play 2'.I liked the original 'Child's Play' a great deal, and I even enjoy 'Bride of Chucky' a lot for it's camp entertainment value. I will say though that I absolutely hate Chucky as a character. It's no fault to Brad Dourif who is an excellent actor and gives some very good vocal work as Chucky. If anything Dourif makes me hate Chucky for all the right reasons. The problem I see with this picture is that it is staged so that Chucky is always the vocal point of everything. Alex Vincent isn't the main character of the picture. We are in a sense encouraged to follow Chucky and still despise him at the same time. It doesn't work.Many fans praise this film for it's black humor. I think this is actually one of the worst things about the film. Don Mancini has written a script that takes this little terror with utmost sincerity. Any joke involving Chucky isn't tongue in cheek, the viciousness is still there. Where as in the superior 'Bride of Chucky' Mancini recognizes the scenario as being very stupid and he plays off that for some brilliant jokes. I think I have to credit Mancini for why this film is terrible. He has written a grim hopeless opus for black souls. It isn't easy for me to do this. I've liked plenty of horror films that have been considered dark and too ugly by mainstream critics. It's a testament to Brad Dourif for taking Mancini's script and bringing it to this level.I think the biggest problem with the script is that Andy is completely alone in his battle with Chucky. Conceptually Mancini is ripping off his original 'Child's Play' to the keel. No one believes little Andy until the bodies pile up. This story is tiresome and unoriginal. Mancini recycles it over and over again but through different lenses. In my opinion he's a lazy screenwriter who struck gold with this character. The concept of a killer doll isn't original enough to recycle the same stories for this killer doll to inhabit. I wish Mancini put more time into his stories than he did into creating this little terror. I'm not praising Mancini in anyway for making Chucky so evil. Mancini was given a tremendous gift in having Brad Dourif respect him and take this role. If a lesser actor took it this character would have died off after the original film.In a sense I have to award Alex Vincent and Brad Dourif praise. They have taken these characters to the utmost degree. I feared for little Andy, and despised little Chucky.Director John Lafia is very good at creating pure horror, not suspense, not fear, but actual horror. He has given us a horrendous situation. To his credit he does it really well. The thing is thought that audiences don't like horror, they like simulated fear. 'Child's Play 2' in all it's silliness has genuine horror. Some sequences are genuinely hard to sit through because of Lafia's staging. He takes Mancini's awful script and really brings out the most in it. I think Tom Holland knew how to better frame this concept. He knew that audiences were attracted to the concept and not the character of Chucky. I could have fun with the original 'Child's Play'. I can't have fun here, not when there are real monsters in the world.

In Jaws 2, having seen what the shark is and what it was capable of, the filmmakers figured there is no need to hide it anymore, and the makers of Child's Play two are doing the same thing with Chucky, big mistake. The tension is reduced to a handful of boo moments, Chucky is no longer scary, he is loud and obnoxious, and the climax offers impressively amusing and money efficient set design in an other wise wreck of a concluding chapter.

Andy is now in a foster home, still affected by the events of the first film 2 years earlier. Unfortunately, the doll company rebuild Chucky in a typically unlikely and stupid horror movie plot point and Chucky goes after Andy again. The film has the same formula as the first Chucky kills people and frames Andy for it, intending to transfer his soul into Andy. With a runtime of less than 90 minutes and a predictable rehashing of the plot points of the first, Child's Play 2 feels slight and more like an extended YouTube compilation of Chucky kills. Acting is better than one may think for a horror film. Brad Dourif is still excellent as Chucky, who is one of the best horror icons out there and Alex Vincent again puts in a good child actor performance. Another neat touch is his foster sister Kyle, who is a surprisingly good addition to the film.There are plenty of exciting moments, such as the finale in the Good Guy Doll Factory and Chucky can be quite amusing, but CP2 just isn't scary. There's no build up, no big reveal this time and Chucky reveals himself to Andy too quickly, showing a desperation to cut to the chase. The direction is nothing to write home about and the script is predictable, unimaginative and has various illogical and contrived moments. The film is gorier than the first, and horror filmmakers seem incapable of realizing gore is actually thoroughly tedious and this undermines the film as a result, contrasting heavily to the suspenseful and patient approach of the first film. CP2 gets boring very quickly, saved mainly by Chucky, who is a very good villain and an entertaining finale, although once again Why. Won't. He.

You always have different tastes when you are younger, but I have no clue what the hell I was thinking at that juncture. This is by no means a bad sequel. As a matter of fact, it's rather fun at times. It's never boring, and always kept my attention. My problem with this sequel is that it was rushed into production when the first one was a hit. The first movie is not only highly suspenseful, but a great psychological horror film. This almost feels like a generic slasher movie at times. The terror you witnessed in the first movie is gone. Chucky is still somewhat creepy like he is in the first movie, but this is when he was really beginning to fire off those one-liners. I think they realized how popular the Chucky character could be, and they essentially turned him into what Freddy became, a comedian. I will say that they don't have Chucky commence an attack on Andy immediately or anything. It's decent psychologically for a little while ( I died laughing when nobody knows Chucky tied Andy to the bed, and Andy yells It's Chucky! I told you he'd find me!

A classic death from a ruler (Miss Kettlewell was very naughty!) and a finale that is quite nasty at a toy factory. This movie has very little suspense. Unlike the original, which was filled with suspense, we don't get much here. I have to mention some pointless scenes, such as Andy trying a cigarette, or a couple of pointless killings. You could tell it wasn't as well crafted as the original. Alex Vincent has to deal with an inferior script than the original. He's adequate, but he doesn't have as much room to play with as he did in the original. He's still one of the more endearing child actors I've seen. If you wanna check out a great performance from him, see the original (I excluded Curse of Chucky, because I've yet to see it) Christine Elsie has a bit of trouble showing emotion at times. It's a shame, since she's fairly charming, and an everyday type of girl you can BS with, but she seemed like stone at certain points. You've got a doll after you, girlie! Shouldn't that account for something?! She was OK overall. Her chemistry with Andy is good as well. I just wish she wasn't so robotic in certain scenes. Jenny Agutter is OK as the Foster Mom. Gerrit Graham is a huge prick as the foster Dad. I wanted to backhand him silly! He played his part well. To be honest, the whole foster storyline was lame. I kept pining for Catherine Hicks (Andy's mom in the first movie) Grace Zabriskie is likable in her role. She's the zany mother of Susan's in Seinfeld, for those that don't know.

Even if the idea of a child's toy possessed by the soul of a serial killer sounded silly, Child's Play was more successful then it had any right to be, thanks to Tom Holland's confident direction and a smart screenplay.Although disowned by the studio, Child's Play was a hit. So Universal quickly bought the rights, eager to launch the character off on a new horror franchise. For Child's Play 2, direction has been handed over to John Lafia, one of the screenwriters on the original film. And unlike the Elm Street sequels, Chucky's encore is a good one.There's nothing stupendous about CP2, nor does it want to be. But John Lafia's direction elevates a thin script. The film abandons Tom Holland's sobering approach. Its still very much a horror film, but a touch of black comedy has crept in as well. It isn't pushed to the extremes that Bride and Seed of Chucky would take it to, but you can see some of it in the film's gleeful tone and colourful set design.One of the things that became annoying about the Elm Street series was how they kept finding ways to resurrect Freddy Krueger. It didn't matter how many times they killed him off. They would just bring him back for the next instalment whether it made sense or not. And although you could make that same criticism of Chucky, CP2 does to its credit find a way to bring him back to life that isn't totally implausible.The toy company that builds the dolls gets a hold of Chucky, or what's left of him. After he was shot to pieces and burned to a crisp at the end of the last film, the company want to know why one of their Good Guy Dolls went on a rampage. They rebuild the doll from the guts up, but the spirit of Charles Lee Ray is still within it, and as soon as the doll is up and running, so is Chucky!Chucky has no intention of living the life of a plastic plaything, and there's only one person who can spare him that, Andy Barclay. Chucky's former owner is stuck in foster care, while his Mum has been carted off to the funny farm for backing up her son's insane claims about the doll. Chucky still needs to possess Andy's body, before he becomes trapped in the doll forever.Although Child's Play 2 is often seen as a soulless rehash, I'll admit I enjoyed it. Its certainly well made, and much higher budgeted than the first film. And John Lafia has a slick, firm hand on the material. Where the first film toyed with our expectations about Chucky, Lafia shows no such restraint. In part 1, we had to wait about 40 minutes before Chucky got to do anything. Wisely, Lafia just jumps right in and delivers Chucky at his murdering, swearing best.Kevin Yagher's puppet effects have come a long way in the two years since. Chucky is allowed more room to move, a range of malicious, animated facial expressions that don't look at all fake, and what with Brad Dourif reprising the role, leaping in with fast energy and zero inhibitions, Chucky is just as much a character as any of his flesh and blood co-stars.The other person who's polished his act since the first film is Alex Vincent. He was a little blank in Child's Play (even more so than Chucky!) but he's developed into a capable, sympathetic lead, and he gets strong support from Christine Elise as his foster sister. Gerrit Graham is stuck in a one-dimensional role and Jenny Agutter struggles with an American accent, but they both give decent performances as Andy's foster parents.Although horror sequels come in for a lot of stick, I must say Child's Play 2 is quite suspenseful at times. Like when Andy hunts for Chucky in a darkened cellar, or Christine Elise's fight with Chucky in a master bedroom. And the film mounts to an effective climax at the Good Guys toy factory. Where the factory set becomes a bewildering backdrop of packing crates, conveyor belts and oxygen pumps as Andy fights Chucky to the death.There's never any doubt that Chucky will survive of course, but Child's Play 2 is a sequel that's fun, tight, with never a dull moment. Things you will never say about an Elm Street sequel.

This is one of the last true Childs Play films in the entire franchise that took on a creepy tone to it. The rest took the Elm Street route, having the character say cheesy catchphrases and have the funny dialogue be the main focus rather than the scares. Still, this one balanced it out perfectly. Enough scares and satire to even out the whole movie. It also stands as a worthy sequel.Andy Barclay is sent to a foster home while is mother takes time in recovery from their last encounter with the doll killer. He is taken by a family of three, Joanne and Phil Simpson, and their teenage daughter Kyle. Andy quickly find Chucky in the house and is petrified to go near him. The family's stress level goes over the top with only Kyle understanding the true pain Andy is facing with the doll. The movie has some great scares in a classroom scene and one of the best, most intense end scenes, I've ever seen. Almost has the adrenaline filled ending to the 1994 movie, Speed.Like I said, this is the last creepy film in the Childs Play franchise. The rest were more of a Horror Comedy, or Black Comedy than the first two which was a shame. It makes me wonder, how would both Nightmare and Childs Play turned out if they the entire franchise was one creepy film after the next. The same fate unfolded for the Leprechaun franchise. By the fourth one (Leprechaun 4 In Space) they started to take a turn for the ultimate worst and become cheesy, laughable, unbelievably bad movies. Then the following sequels (which were the last two) took place strictly in the hood or ghetto, which was the cemented end of the franchise. I was surprised after the green fellow went to space the series carried on. Space is a sign of a dead end and a plead for new ideas. Luckily Chucky hasn't visited the galaxy yet.Starring Alex Vincent, Jenny Agutter, Gerrit Graham, Christine Elise, and Brad Dourif. Directed by John Lafia.

You have seen this before so the surprise is gone and the plot remains basically the same. Nothing is really added to this movie to really distinguish it from the first movie. I never saw part III, but from what I have seen they did try to do at least one thing different by having the kid from these two movies all grown up in what is the span of three years. He hit one of those growth spurts like the baby on the Family Ties television series I am thinking. This movies highlight is the end of the film where we get to see the kid and this girl put Chucky through a whole heck of a lot, yet he keeps coming after the kid. Seriously, you have to give your props to Chucky for hanging in there, he would have been put through a lot less pain had he simply stayed an evil doll.

The market was flooded in the 1980s, but the flood was mostly plugged up by the early 1990s. 'Child's Play,' a film blending the slasher and killer toy subgenres, came at the end of the 80s slasher cycle, but still would get it's share of sequels in the next decade or so. The first came two years later, putting Chucky in line with all the horror greats like Jason, Freddy, and Michael.Pros Performances are good. Special effects are excellent. A good score. Well-paced. A neat opening titles sequence. Writer Don Mancini injects some humor into this one. Some good kills. Powerhouse finale.Cons Plot is thin. Unless you're afraid of dolls come to life, this film isn't much for scares. Characters are way underdeveloped.Final thoughts The first 'Child's Play' is no masterpiece, and this sequel isn't either, but is a good start for a series and has earned it's place in the Horror Hall of Fame. Though not spectacular, this first of several sequels is far from being a waste of time and does a fine job of carrying on the legacy.My rating 3.5/5 "}{"Title":"If it's any good at all then it's good for the first hour or so, after which illogical actions and mindless chase kicks in.","Date":"8 September 2008","Score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Fantasy, Horror","Review":" Child's Play 2, like so many other films in its respective 'slasher' sub-genre, begs the question at probably around about the hour mark, by which time we'll have seen a couple of grizzly ends, 'are we still scared by something that's been happening for the last sixty minutes?' Sure, cheap thrills and the odd manifested jump are good fun but after a while a few of these do wear you down and the film feels like a procession. Child's Play 2 is one of these films that is good for what it is but the ambiguity surrounding the young hero's mental state and the consistent feeling you have that a character is about to get eliminated makes you weary.The returning hero is Andy Barclay (Vincent) and whilst he won't need quite as much child counselling as Rachel Carruthers' little sister in Halloween 4, it's probably still recommended. But Andy's suffering is escalated in this film, nicely put across in the film's opening. Andy is adopted by some foster parents that put across an uncomfortable feeling for the audience to endure, mostly down to the fact the father isn't sure on whether he wants a foster-child in the first place and Andy's time at school is difficult with particular attention paid to bullies and strict teachers.But while the parents that are Phil (Graham) and Joanne (Agutter) come across as quite useless, Andy's one mentor that it seems can keep him safe or is at least on his level is his new foster-sister, Kyle (Elsie). Combining the protagonist's sister of sorts as a motherly figure is a brave move for the film to take &#150; it echoes the work psychoanalytic theorists might undertake when studying a disturbed child's psychosis and whom a really young child may latch onto when seeking a motherly figure of sorts. In this case, Andy fits the bill as the disturbed child and perhaps the equally disturbed Kyle slots into place as the young but old enough for Andy's sake motherly figure whom must protect him and help him through any obstacles.Although Child's Play 2 remains nothing spectacular. The film is really a series of events that place the child in a string of unnerving and unpleasant situations. The main source for suspense lies in the manner of which Andy tries to convince those around him, haplessly, that he is innocent of doing certain things like breaking a family ornament, and that Chucky is the reason. We know it wasn't Andy but his superiors have no reason to suspect otherwise thus rendering the scenes effective in their own right but somewhat disturbing from the audience's point of view &#150; this is largely down to how we react to seeing very young children being put in vulnerable positions and made to look incorrect.But this segment of the film has this and only this going for it. There is a bit of suspense and some nicely timed comic touches when another, less animated, Chucky doll is around and the evil Chucky must remember what his name was upon taking identity. Then there is the scene in which Kyle finds the doll buried in the garden and the penny drops. The trouble is, we, or at least I, wouldn't have cared if Chucky had won these battles. If we look at the possible knife fodder in the opening exchanges, they consist of Andy (who we don't want to be harmed); Kyle (who we progressively don't want harmed); the foster parents (who we don't really mind seeing harmed), Andy's teacher (who we wouldn't mind seeing harmed) and some of the meaner kids at the school. Trouble is, if Chucky kills some of these characters as you're watching the film it wouldn't be all that bad because of the manner in which they're put across initially. This results in us siding with the villain which can be fun at times in other films perhaps but not here.So if the film is at its most effective during these exchanges in the first hour, then what follows surely relegates the film to the level of failure. After certain events transpire and it turns out Kyle and Andy must leave the house, the film falls apart. It turns into a brainless chase/slasher with disturbed logic and references to other, much better past horror films notice the chase in the maze of factory boxes at the end being very akin to the The Shining finale and the scene from Psycho in which a female slowly turns around the character of the mother who's sitting in a chair with a face you don't want to see. Questions are raised, not least when Kyle runs Chucky over in the car and then gets out to check if she got him; sure enough, he jumps on her back and attacks. Then there is the shot at the factory of the 'release valve' sign, which is the most blatant set up for future events to happen I've ever seen in a film.Child's Play 2 is not ashamed of being paint by numbers for its final act. There is the fatal blow, the twist of fate, the false conclusion and then the film tiptoes around the new order completely, meaning we have to pencil in what happens next. The conflict is there and the film gets across a desperate atmosphere of lust for survival but somewhere along the lines it felt like the brains behind the operation went walkabout.

Once reborn, Chucky decides to track down Andy and pickup where he left off. Andy is sent to a foster home that looks like the parents rake in billions taking care of foster kids. Given their young age, and the realities of foster parent payment, one can only guess how they got the perfect house that Barbie must have built. It's difficult to pinpoint how many rooms this thing has, but it must dwarf the white house for space, and is too sterile and quiet for a child's haven. Kyle, a perpetual foster kid, is Andy's new sidekick in the film. She is a streetwise young woman who does not take any garbage from anybody and ultimately helps Andy destroy Chucky.Another problem I had with the film stems from the domineering teacher. I never thought I would say this (and please note, I am not endorsing school violence in anyway) but congrats to Chucky for taking out Ms. Kettlewell after she completely humiliated Andy in the classroom in front of his peers.

Basically it has been two years since the events of the first film, and Chucky the Doll, possessed by the soul of The Lakeshore Strangler, Charles Lee Ray (Brad Dourif) (named after Charles Manson, Lee Harvey Oswald and James Earl Ray), has been recovered and reconstructed by Play Pals Inc. They have had bad publicity because of the events reported, and they have put together this doll for analysis and to prove to the public there was nothing wrong with it, of course they were unaware that the soul of Ray still inhabits the doll, so he comes back to life soon enough. Chucky is after the child he tried to transfer his soul into before, now eight year old Andy Barclay (Alex Vincent), who has been placed in a foster home, as his mother is in a psychiatric hospital for thinking that a doll tried to kill them. Andy is living with foster parents Joanne Simpson (An American Werewolf in London's Jenny Agutter) and Phil Simpson (Gerrit Graham), and teenage orphan Kyle (Christine Elise), who has been transferred to numerous foster homes due to her trouble making. Chucky manages to find where Andy is, and finding another Good Guy Doll in the house he switches himself with it, and for a while Andy is fearful but unaware it is the same doll that tried to get him before, until of course he is tied up and almost his his soul taken away. Andy is next having a day in his new school, and gets into trouble with teacher Miss Kettlewell (Donnie Darko's Beth Grant) for apparently writing an expletive on his test paper, and trying to catch Andy again, Chucky kills the teacher. This chasing and killing spree continues, with anyone getting in the doll's way falling victim to his evil intent, even the Simpsons get killed as no-one believes the little boy's story that the doll is trying to get him. Kyle does discover the truth about Chucky when she uncovers the original Tommy Good Guy Doll buried in the back yard, but she cannot stop him from getting away and heading for Andy who is being held in the Foster Centre. The little boy is forced to take Chucky to a seemingly empty place, the large Play Pals Inc. factory making the hundreds of Good Guy Dolls ready for shipping, and he tries to transfer his soul into the boy's body. But he has been inside the doll body for too long and he is trapped in the body he has, so in rage he tries to kill Andy and Kyle, chasing them through the factory, and losing his hand in the process, replacing it with a knife blade. After losing his legs as well, Chucky is splashed by heated plastic mould until apparently dead, but then he springs to life one more time, before getting an air hose shoved into his mouth, and inflated until he explodes, and Andy and Kyle walk out relieved it is over. Also starring Grace Zabriskie as Grace Poole, Peter Haskell as Sullivan and Greg Germann as Mattson. As before Vincent is cute as the little boy forced to run away from the evil doll chasing him, and the puppet techniques and menacing and wisecracking vocals of Dourif make Chucky the star of the film. It is fair to say that this follow up is almost the same thing all over again in terms of the concept, especially seeing characters realise the doll is alive seconds before they are killed in a nasty way, but you can't help but like the deaths, the finale in the toy factory, and of course Chucky the killer doll, not a really bad horror sequel.

The only difference is that Universal took the film rights, ending up producing all the sequels so far. The only returnees are scribes John Lafia (who has taken the director's chair) & Don Mancini, the producer & visual effects people, as well as stars Alex Vincent & Brad Dourif.The Play Pals toy factory has obtained the burnt remains of Chucky & sets out to discover the fault by rebuilding it. Returning to life, Chucky tries to track down Andy Barclay who, following his mother's committal to an asylum, has been sent to live with foster parents Phil & Joanne Simpson. Things don't go according to plan, with the doll resorting to murder in order to get to Andy.To be quite frank, I didn't really like the original film. It was, as some critics have pointed out, extremely silly. The concept had a limited idea &#x96; that of a killer doll doing a Freddy Krueger - & was full of ridiculous plot twists (the idea that a person could transfer their soul into a doll is bad enough, but having its body turning human & only being able to transfer again into the first person to uncover its secret is just plain ludicrous). I first saw this sequel when I was a child & it unnerved me. Watching it today, I ended up laughing.While it is stuck with the same stupid plot as the original, Child's Play 2 is actually better, mainly due to Lafia making some scenes truly suspenseful. There's a scene where Alex Vincent hunts Chucky in the dark basement, which has a commendable tension, as well as the teenage girl cornering it in the bedroom. Don Mancini's script is a lot better than his previous work, but still has some dead spots, making the Child's Play series the filmic equivalent of an M60 machine gun &#x96; in the sense that both the films & the weapon started out as very poor designs & have now reached a high standard of mediocrity.The other thing about the film is Chucky himself, killing people while spouting one-liners. The doll effects are better this time around, with the doll's features looking more human than doll. The climax, where Chucky is slowly destroyed piece-by-piece (first he loses his hand, then his lower half, then is covered with molten plastic & finally blown up with an air pump) is similar to the climax of THE TERMINATOR, although not as good as that film ever was.One of the script's strengths is that it conducts things in a more believable manner than the first film. The doll is rebuilt in the toy factory (although I don't think that, after the technicians completely build the doll from a burnt skull, they should use a machine to insert the eyes &#x96; can't they do it themselves?) in order to unearth the reason it turned deadly, while Catherine Hicks is sent to the loony bin because she backed up her son's story in court.On the acting front, Jenny Agutter (fans of war films will recognize her from THE EAGLE HAS LANDED) & Gerrit Graham do a good job as the foster parents, while Brad Dourif delivers another good performance as the wisecracking Chucky. Alex Vincent, who I thought was a whiny brat in the first film, has grown up (if only slightly) & does the kid-in-distress thing a lot better than he did in the original.

Not much later, he was asked to write a third film of the franchise. He said it impacted his writing, as he was out of ideas after writing this one. Well, how many ideas did he have before, exactly? The first had a fairly good plot, but this has the unlucky fate of being the second film in a series of films that started with an idea that only really allowed for one film. The same could be said of Terminator 2, but James Cameron worked that out nicely, by directing a sequel that was almost a remake. But enough about that. Where this movie goes wrong plot-wise is by using a cheap ploy to put Andy, our main character, in basically the exact same situation that he was in the first film; knowing that the doll was alive but no one believing him. That worked well in the first film, partly because we weren't sure if Chucky was alive for a while. Here, it's just a cheap ploy to ensure that no one will help Andy. Of course, this installation also suffers under the curse of sequels to horror movies; everything needs to be bigger(because 'bigger is better'). More deaths, more gruesome death scenes and, for some reason, more obscenities. It might be because Chucky talks more for this one, but he seemed to swear more randomly as well. And why was he suddenly so bloody lighthearted? Early in the film, he seemed to laugh every five seconds. Anyway, the deaths are nicely done, and the fact that there are more of them doesn't bother me(I am a horror fan, after all). It's more how they are virtually ignored or written off by characters in the film. In the first film, the deaths were few and far between, and they looked like accidents. Here, the bodies pile up, and it's clear to anyone that these are intentional killings. Which leads me to a gaping plot hole; in the first, we were told that he was a psychopath and a killer. The killings weren't expanded upon. Here, we're told that he, being the voodoo aficionado that he is, killed them ritually. Now, if he did that when he was alive, why does he settle for just killing people now that he's dead? I mean, he does go out of his way to kill people, but now he doesn't care about the voodoo stuff anymore? What gives? Now, as the one line summary of my comment tells you, this has grotesque amounts of 'fake' scares. For anyone who doesn't know what that means, it's getting a cheap jump-scare out of the viewers through something that has nothing to do with the actual horror of the film. Cat jumping down from high point, friend appearing suddenly from behind character, etc. You know them, I know them, and we(by 'we' I mean us horror fans) all hate them. The plot is somewhat good, what little there is of it, though too much of it is just to set up new Chucky scenes, either involving him going after Andy or killing off one or more of the many characters that have the words 'I'm going to be killed off' printed on their foreheads from the moment we see them(...not literally, of course). Which brings me to the point of the characters. They are somewhat well-written and credible, but they are in no way interesting or likable(with the exception of Andy and Kyle), making them uninteresting victims(where's the fun in seeing you don't care about getting killed?) and they, like the plot, are written around how Chucky acts, to protect him and his 'mission' from interference. The acting is good enough, with Christine Elise and Alex Vincent, the kid who plays Andy being the only two who transcend the mediocre level of acting that everyone else seems to stay at. The special effects have clearly evolved quite a lot since the first, and it makes the Chucky scenes more pleasing to the eye. The end is about as overdone as the first one. All in all, probably only a film for the people who really liked the first. If you only 'kind of' enjoyed the first, you probably won't like this one... unless you thought what the first lacked was more death and less plot. I recommend this to fans of the first and of horror in general. I don't advise anyone to watch this if you haven't seen the first yet, though. Not only is the first a better film, it sets the tone for this pretty well and contains a lot of plot that this doesn't summarize for new viewers. 6/10 "},{"Title":"Not as expected to be...","Date":"26 February 2014","Score":"0 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Fantasy, Horror","Review":" Child's Play 2 is the sequel of Child's Play and in this movie we have Chucky who is killing people in his way of taking a boy's soul.

It's a better constructed movie, with a better build-up to it, more slasher ingredients and a more insane and evil Chucky.Of course it's not a perfect movie and it isn't even all that great as an horror but I really enjoyed watching it. The concept of having a killer doll is of course a ridicules one but the movie makes great use of it. It does so by making Chucky this time even more evil and there are quite a lot of kills in this movie. And some pretty good ones as well, which is not something I could say about the first and original Child's Play movie, made 2 years earlier. In that regard this movie already works better as a slasher and horror movie than the first one ever did.But I also thought the story was way better this time, which caused the movie to flow better and more naturally. All of the kills and horror were pretty much forced into the first movie but in this movie it feels far more like it's a part of the story. No, it's not a brilliantly written story or even a very original one, it just simply allows the movie its pace and build-up to work out quite good and pleasantly.Another thing that really surprised me was its musical score. I don't even remember the first movie having a musical score at all but in this one it's pretty notable. Graeme Revell did a great job with it and it truly helps to make some of the movie its moments to stand out.One of the things that wasn't as good as in the first movie though was its acting. It stars the same young boy played by Alex Vincent again but in the first movie I was quite impressed with his performance, while in this one he's quite horrible to be honest. He never shows any emotions and pretty much has the same look on his face, throughout the entire movie. It doesn't matter if he's playing scared, sad, happy. or neutral. I don't know how this happened but perhaps it was because this movie got done by a different director. Maybe John Lafia just couldn't direct kids as well as Tom Holland.But overall I can see myself watching this movie over and over again, while I probably won't ever see the first movie again, any time soon.7/10 http//bobafett1138.blogspot.com/ "},{"Title":"A Fun Sequel That Doesn't Skimp on Thrills.","Date":"25 January 2010","Score":"0 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Fantasy, Horror","Review":" You just can't keep a Good Guy down, and in this sequel to 1988's Child's Play, Chucky the killer doll (Brad Dourif) returns to haunt his friend 'til the end, Andy (Alex Vincent). Now under foster care following the events of the first film, Andy is just getting his life back together when Chucky shows up to play, and once again, has a Hell of a time proving to everyone that he is innocent.Although it lacks the sheer suspense of the first film, Child's Play 2 is still a good time. With Chucky now taking a more prominent and vocal role (a.k.a. more wise-cracks than before) the film gets by with some improved special effects, a few truly grisly death scenes and a superb score by Graeme Revell. The direction by John Lafia has more of a funhouse feel to it than the first, but is more than appropriate for the kind of film it is. The film caps off with a face-off in the factory that serves as the birthplace of Chucky and his fellow Good Guys that is both outlandish and thrilling. With its smooth pacing and tight script, not a moment is left to waste and at no point does it drag or try to repeat the first film in any way.Despite the fact that it's not quite up to par with its predecessor, Child's Play 2 goes a long way with its premise in delivering a razor-sharp slasher that is as fun as it is morbid. Chucky truly comes into his own in the film as a creepy killer turned into a wise-cracker (ala Freddy Krueger) and, in turn, makes the film lighter fare than the first. Chucky fans will no doubt revel in its mean-spirited madness and as far as slasher sequels go, they don't get much better than this.

If so I'd say it was MGM who showed business savvy . The original - which I haven't seen in years - does contain instinctively fond memories but I'm not sure to give much credence to my memories . I should also point out there's a very 80s seen it all before feel to this sequel . Wise cracking monsters that murder and mutilate humans ? We saw that in the NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET and HELLRAISER franchises . Was anyone expecting this type of horror to last well in to the 21st Century ? neither did I . Pity Universal Studios didn't give me a job because I could have stopped them losing money There's also another aspect that's wrong and that's the audience identification . The story revolves around possessed doll Chucky trying to track down a young boy called Andy . Hmmm a horror film where the audience are supposed to relate to a child ! Fair enough if it was a children's movie but it's not so couldn't the producers come up with the protagonist being a more mature character ? To be fair they do have a teenage girl as the heroine but she's not technically the main character . Couldn't Andy have been dropped altogether in the draft stage and have Kyle as the protagonist ? There's also a feel that there's a fair bit of slumming from the cast . I've no idea why Brad Dourif didn't become a big name after ONE FLEW OVER THE CUCKOO'S NEST and show's you how far he fell when he's probably best remembered as being the voice of Chucky instead of his roles in NEST and THE TWO TOWERS . Jenny Agutter is a surprise casting choice being a well known name and the fact that her character's death receives no build up or impact aesthetic tell's you all you need to know as to how ill thought out this mediocre sequel is "},{"Title":"OK, the thing I don't get is that the doll can't be more than two feet high and weigh more than 1 pound, so what's the big deal?","Date":"15 July 2006","Score":"1 out of 5 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Fantasy, Horror","Review":" For some obscene reason, I do want to see the Child's Play series.

One of my friends also said that I have to see Bride and Seed for the Chucky series, but I didn't want to see those without understanding maybe a few things I missed in the third or second Child's Play.Some silly deaths occur in this movie, like the teacher's. I mean, did anyone look at that as more of a porn movie than a horror flick? You've been very naughty Mrs. Kettlewell!, slapping the ruler? You'll see what I mean. I just thought that it was very funny instead of gruesome and also very unbelievable. But then again, I wasn't looking for Oscar material.

You'll find yourself saying NO to quite a few scenes!There was some stylish direction, but only occasionally.Not the worst horror movie made by any means - but if you watch it, don't pay for the opportunity.

The soul of a psycho-killer inside a doll was a big hit at the box-office and you know what that means...More from the same!! And fast! But hey, who's complaining? Child's Play 2 is fairly good. Some nice twists, several funny moments and a few very original killings. What more could you ask for in a horror sequel? Story doesn't matter. In fact, can you call this a story ? Chucky comes back to life and continues to chase Andy to take over his soul. He has to kill everyone who comes too close to him and his secret and every time he's about to call Dumballah ( or whatever ), he gets interrupted. Voilà, there you have the plot of Child's Play 2. Original ? No. Entertaining ? Yes, very. Jenny Agutter plays the role of Andy's foster mom. I tell you, she still is as adorable as when she played her role in American Werewolf in London...only older, of course. Brad Dourif returns as the voice of Chucky and he seems to enjoy that very much. That's about all there is to say about Child's Play 2. Certainly not a urgently need-to-see movie but pure fun if you come across it on TV or something. It's recommended to watch the first two films in a row. Child's Play 3, however, should be avoided like the plague...yuk. The more recent Bride of Chucky uses a whole other style, but surely is worth a look. I'm quite sure more sequels have yet to come...

Meanwhile Andy Barclay (Alex Vincent) has been placed in a care home after his mom goes into psychiatric care, he is adopted for a short time by Joanne (Jenny Agutter) & Phil Simpson (Geritt Graham) who make him welcome in their home. Chucky the possessed Good Guy doll finds out where Andy is now living & sets out to exchange souls before he is trapped in the Good Guy doll forever...Directed by John Lafia this was the sequel to the surprise hit Child's Play (1988) & for what it is it's a rather enjoyable follow up, in fact I think it's a slightly better film than the original. The script by Don Mancini is far more serious in tone than the later sequels despite some foul mouthed one-liners uttered by Chucky, Child's Play 2 feels much more like a standard slasher horror film franchise sequel than the two most recent entries & as far as standard horror sequels go it's pretty good. The character's are good, the dialogue is fine & I particularly liked the storyline here. The idea behind how Chucky is resurrected is rather clever & actually works really well, I really liked the ending set in the doll making factory as Andy & Kyle dodge automated machines, the way Andy is brought back & Chucky's quest to transfer his soul into his body makes for a fun way to pass 80 odd minutes. It moves along like a rocket, there are some good kill scenes although the body count is a bit low for my liking & I'd have liked to have seen a bit more blood & gore but since this was a major studio picture from the 90's the lack of blood doesn't come as much of a surprise. A pleasant surprise & better than I had expected.Director Lafia does a fine job here, it's not the most stylish film ever made but there's a few creepy moments & it's very well made. The special effects are very good, the way Chucky is brought to life by animatronic puppets is pretty convincing. Thhere aren't really any special effects you can point to & say they were bad, I'm not happy about the lack of gore effects though with only a stabbing, a factory worker having his eyeballs replaced with dolls eyes & a messy demise for Chucky himself the only real gory death's. The film has some nice horror scenes & a few jump out of your seat moments, whenever the foul mouthed Chucky is on screen the film comes to life & it becomes very watchable & good fun.With a pretty big sounding budget of about $13,000,000 Child's Play 2 was actually a well funded film, it's very well made with good special effects & good production values. Shot in Illinois in Chicago. The acting is good by all involved, I'm not sure what an actress like Jenny Agutter is doing in this though & despite her near top billing barley features & is killed off before the 50 minute mark.Child's play 2 is a much better film & sequel than I had expected, it's nothing amazing but at least it's enjoyable if taken for what it is. Followed by Child's Play 3 (1991) before the series took a different direction with Bride of Chucky (1998) & Seed of Chucky (2004) while a remake of the original Child's Play (2009) has been announced. "},{"Title":"Fair","Date":"24 May 2008","Score":"1 out of 10 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Fantasy, Horror","Review":" Child's Play 2 (1990) ** (out of 4) Sequel to the 1988 cult classic has Andy (Alex Vincent) now living with foster parents but old Chucky is back and after him once again because the killer needs a body for his evil soul. The reasons behind Chucky being able to come back to life is pretty stupid and that stupidity really runs throughout the entire movie and one can't help but be disappointed in this first sequel in the series. The movie hasn't really held up well over the years and it's rather shocking at how dated the film comes off even though it's really not that old. There's some mild entertainment in the gore department as we get some nice kills but that's pretty much all the film offers up. The highlight is of course Brad Dourif who once again does the voice of Chucky. I'm not sure what Dourif did for his role but he really adds so much life to Chucky and I'd say his voice brings the doll to life a lot better than the special effects. Vincent also fills his role very well and turns in a nice performance. Jenny Agutter and Gerrit Graham turn in fine performances as the foster parents even though neither role is written too well. The biggest disappointment with this sequel is that it's very lame when it comes to the suspense scenes, unlike the original film, which had some very good suspense. The ending, set inside a toy factory, manages to be very entertaining but in the end there's really not too much going for the film since the screenplay is very weak. "}]
