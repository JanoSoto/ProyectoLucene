What could possibly go wrong?","Date":"9 April 2004","Score":"19 out of 22 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy","Review":"  Feast your eyes one of the last films that both Corey's will appear in that are of any merit for the rest of their brief careers. And this can be considered something of merit, despite the nature of the film, since they were only teen stars. License to Drive is a movie about taking chances, though you can probably figure out from beginning to end how the movie is going to go. No less, it's good 80s fun. Les Anderson (Haim) has turned 16 and is desperate to get his driver's license. Over-confident, it is no surprise that he flunks the exam. But he figures no one would notice. So, he lies to his folks and friends about the whole thing, expecting everything will be smooth sailing until he can retake the exam. But Les is wrong once again when his parents learned that he lied, serving up a harsh two week grounded term. But Les doens't know when to quit while he's ahead, and decides he's not going to let this little matter inconvenience him. After all, he has a Friday night date with his dream girl Mercedes Lane (Heather Graham). Hence the line, an innocent girl, a harmless drive, what could possibly go wrong? Everything. It all has to do with Les borrowing his grandfather's antique (and very off limits) Caddillac, a drunk date, and two friends looking for their newly licensed friend to show them a wild night. Sure it's predictable, but it's just a simple 80s comedy.

Sure, those were excellent films and very talented actors, but with all the focus on those actors sometimes the gems get overlooked. License to Drive is surely on of those gems.License To Drive, one of only a few films that stars both Corey Haim and Corey Feldman, is a perfect 80's teen comedy. Shot at the height of both of the Coreys careers, while they were both still in high school, the film captures their youthful spirit perfectly. License to Drive is hilarious and outrageous while still remaining simple and easy to follow.Haim plays Les Anderson who like every high school kid has nothing but girls and cars on his mind. But this isn't just any girl. Les has his eye on the most beautiful girl in school. The bombshell is played by a very young and beautiful, Heather Graham. When Les is lucky enough to score a date with the bombshell, the only obstacle he must overcome is his pending drivers license test so that he can take his fathers car to pick her up in.Like most high school students, Les slept through drivers education class and when the time comes, he fails his drivers test. But the fun has just begun. Les isn't going to let this stop him. He takes the car anyways. Uh oh... this never turns out right. The night takes a turn for the worse when Les's best friend (Corey Feldman) shows up with 'a plan.' Another bad sign. Well the night just gets wilder and wilder and ends up with Heather Graham drunk as a skunk locked in the trunk of a car, police roadblocks, crazed militants running the streets and some really mean and angry drag racers to boot.License To Drive really has it all. It's a perfect 80's teenage comedy. The DVD has loads of extra goodies including interviews with the stars and tons of deleted footage.Fasten your seat belts, you're in for one totally awesome ride!!!

If you are going 2watch any of their movies make it this one as their output in the nineties as not up to scratch. Nice to see a young Heather Graham in one of her first decent roles as the out of reach babe Haim falls for. The film is also complimented by the great soundtrack featuring eighties greats, Billy Ocean, Belinda Carlisle and many others. Look out for a great cameo from Uncle Phil from the Fresh Prince of Bel Air who plays Les' driving instructor. The Scene with the drunk driver is especially funny. This film is made even more hilarious by the fact that Corey Haim drove round LA without a real driving license for many years when he was in his wild child years. They Rock.

It was playing on TV recently and I have not only watched it, but am waiting to see if I am fortunate to find the DVD so I can buy it.Quite simply, if you are a fan of the 80's and/or love your nostalgia then this film is for you! Typical 80's groove, lingo, starring leads (introducing a young and very attractive Heather Graham in her screen debut as the delicious Mercedes Lane) and, something that definitely deserves a mention is the soundtrack! Great tunes that suit the mood perfectly. Billy Ocean's Get Outta My Dreams, Get Into My Car was a highlight and with the title License to Drive was the ultimate song. There are others by Belinda Carlise and the Breakfast Club that will have you not only reminiscing, but toe tapping and humming as well.Also, look out for James Avery as Les' DMV Instructor.

Funny, blokes with rolled up sleeve jackets and with terrible acting by Haim what's not to like? Getting serious for a moment, it is actually a very good film. Tightly written, well directed and with good supporting acting it would get a nine if only Haim could stop a) Blinking b) Keep his mouth shut, he looks like a fish. If anyone wants to know what all the fuss was about in the late eighties with two lads called Corey, then this is the film to watch. In fact it should be given to directors as a how to manual, on how to make a light breezing ENTERTAINING film, which the movies sadly lack these days. A film every home should own. LEGENDARY.

Les and his twin sister Natalie Anderson (Nina Siemaszko) are preparing to the driving test and while Natalie studies the questions, he does not pay attention to them. Les fails the test but is not brave enough to tell neither to his father Mr. Anderson (Richard Masur) nor to his pregnant mother Mrs. Anderson (Carol Kane) and his best friends Dean (Corey Feldman) and the clumsy Charles (Michael Manasseri). When Mercedes has an argument with Paolo, she invites Les to date her to make Paolo jealous. Meanwhile Les' parents discover that he has flunked his driver's test and they ground him. However, when Mercedes calls him asking if they are not going to date, Les sneaks away from his house and drives his grandfather's Cadillac that is parked in the garage to date Mercedes in the beginning of a nightmarish night of adventures.License to Drive is a comedy from the 80's still very funny after almost thirty years. This is one of the best roles of Corey Haim in the top of his career immediately after the cult Lost Boys and Lucas and the debut of Heather Graham. The plot would be considered politically incorrect in the present days but fortunately it was not a problem in 1988.

I adore such a movie. It's a decent comedy, non-stop action, and centering on beating fear by facing its worst nightmares. It succeeds in every each way it goes, with fascinating sense of creativity.How can any comedy be smarter ? See for instance the character of the father apart; the way he celebrates his son's faultier as a driver and why, his scenes with the about-to-give-birth wife, and his threatening speech near the end. Just unforgettable. The thing about this movie is that it knows its characters and their lives, then could mix that with a lovely touch of craziness where everything you don't expect happens. So, it wins at being truthful and lively. This is one way to be a classic. Not by the heaviest amount of toilet humor !Despite being not highly charismatic Corey Haim was wonderful as the perturbed aghast and eager teen. Heather Graham was fabulous in pink, being every teen's dream back then (and look closer to her name; Mercedes Lane !). Loved her performance as always-happy unconscious drunk. The minor parts were done no less than excellent, even the drunken old driver. Then the best credit must go to that incredible climax; now the teen gets his full chance to drive outrageously by the approval of his parents, winning the recognition he dreamed of, achieving rescuing his mom and her baby on the nick of time, yet that itself was done in one outrageous piece of cinema. Again, this script is smart, smashing smart !It evoked many similar themes and atmospheres from the same era  the suburban teen who wants to challenge his fear, a ride of a lifetime in the city; John Hughes's Ferris Bueller's Day Off (1986), a hellish night of accumulative misunderstanding and funny circumstance; Adventures in Babysitting (1987). My conclusion  Is the 1980s cute or what ?Remember the moment in which the lead lives a cassette tape crises, where the thin brown strip explodes. Ahh, this is something only the audience born before the 1990s knows well, suffered from and laughs about. With CDs and else more advanced devises now, plus teen comedies that have become all about obscenity, you must think; does more development mean more degeneration ? or when things grow less complicated, other things grow more ugly ?Anyway, this is a teen comedy and decent classic. Now the 4 words don't meet together in one sentence at all !

There's nothing to state about the direction, since it's not that important in such comedies.

Despite his having flunked his driver's test, he's not about to let anything stop him from being with Mercedes (Heather Graham, in her first substantial movie role), the girl he adores. So he makes off with his grandfather's prized Cadillac for one incredible, long night of misadventures. Now, admittedly some viewers can find certain elements objectionable - the protracted sequence with the drunk driver, or the fact that Mercedes gets herself drunk - but this movie still provides lively, zany entertainment for a very well paced 90 minutes. It resonates with so many of us who saw that driver's license as one of our first steps towards freedom and maturity, seeing all the possibilities before us for good times. Les just couldn't have predicted the kind of stuff that happens to him and his buds Dean-o (a priceless Corey Feldman) and Charles (Michael Manasseri). The aforementioned problem with the drunk driver (Harvey Miller) is just one of them. The highly quotable dialogue includes such gems as I'm so dead they're going to have to bury me twice.. The movie gets off to a fine start with its hilarious opening sequence, and the supporting cast is full of familiar and reliable actors, starting with a delightful Carol Kane as Les's pregnant mom and the always solid Richard Masur as his flustered dad. Graham looks great, and is perfectly cast. Nina Siemaszko is a hoot as Les's uptight sister, as is Grant Heslov as her boyfriend. Other amusing contributions are made by Grant Goodeve, as the most relaxed driving tester on Earth, and James Avery, as a far more intimidating one, Michael Ensign in a dual role as the bus driver & driver's ed teacher, and Helen Hanft as the scary Miss Hellberg of the DMV. License to Drive just breezes along (it certainly would out pace a street sweeper), coming up with some irresistible gags, and suffice it to say, that poor Caddy takes a lot of abuse before the movie is over. It wouldn't be inaccurate to regard this movie as perhaps the ultimate teaming of the two Coreys; it's definitely a career highlight for both. Eight out of 10.

Les' brash hipster best friend Dean (Corey Feldman in top-rate supremely cool form) and their nerdy pal Charles (a charmingly geeky Michael Manasseri) tag along for the wild and outrageous ride. Director Greg Beeman, working from a smart and witty script by Neil Tolkin, relates the eventful and entertaining story at a zippy pace, maintains an amiable good-natured tone throughout, and adroitly milks the funny sense of inspired zany humor for loads of major laughs (the final gag concerning Les' grandpa in particular is a gut-busting corker!). Moreover, this movie deserves extra praise for having actual teenagers portraying adolescents. The lively acting from the able cast helps matters a whole lot The strong and appealing chemistry between the two Coreys keeps the picture humming, with sturdy support from Richard Masur as Les' easygoing father, Carol Kane as Les' wacky pregnant mother, Nina Siemaszko as Les' stuck-up snob sister Natalie, James Avery as Les' hard-nosed DMV examiner, Helen Hanft as formidable DMV head honcho Miss Hellberg, and, in an especially bravura uncredited turn, Henry Alan Miller as a raucous drunk driver.

He also gets to go out on a date with a very attractive lady as well named Mercedes (played by Heather Grahme). Well for some reason he does not do so well on the computer quiz portion of the driving test, but thanks to some luck the test results are wiped out and he is given the chance to take the driving portion of the test. Which of course is highly unlikely no matter how well his sister scored. Well he somehow manages to pass the driving portion despite having a driving instructor from hell while his sister gets the guy everyone should want during this part. In the end though they find his score and no license. Well through a series of strange events he gets his grampa's car and takes the hot girl out as she proceeds to get drunk and pass out. He then picks up his friends as they try to get to this cool hangout. Lets just say a lot of stuff happens and that car takes some hits. I especially found the drunk guy funny.

License to Drive is a fast-paced, original Comedy which is probably my favorite Haim/Feldman movie.The most embarrassing part of a teens life is being driven to a party or school by their parents. The parents are the ultimate antagonist when caught dropping their kids off because that means the teen doesn't have a driver's license. I'm sure it will be like that when I reach High School.Les Anderson (Corey Haim), the slacker type, crashes the computer on accident in anger after failing his driver's test. His teacher can't find the score to his test, which leads him to take the driving portion of his test, coached by a certain uncle, from a certain Will Smith show.He passes that test, but the teacher recovers his score, realizing he failed, rips up his driver's license, leaving Les to be driven by his parents. He then unwillingly takes out his grandfather's prized Cadillac to take out his new girlfriend Mercedes Lane (Heather Graham) who gets drunk and passes out on their date. He goes to his friend Dean's (Corey Feldman) house. Les, Dean, and their geeky friend Charles (Michael Manasseri) embark on a journey to a drag racing competition in Les' uncle's Cadillac.I have always had a weakness for 80s Comedies that depict the life of true teenagers (most of which are John Hughes movies). This, Sixteen Candles, The Breakfast Club, Ferris Bueller's Days Off, Career Opportunities, and so many others deal with real conflicts that teenagers have consistently. Though I have to feel bad that this one is overlooked and almost like it is never spoken about anymore seeing as it's very touching and funny.Perhaps one of the best 80s Comedies I have seen, License to Drive delivers heavily and keeps the laughs coming.Starring Corey Haim, Corey Feldman, Heather Graham, and Michael Manasseri.

While Les passes his test driving on the road,he fails his computer exam. Although Les has no license and is in trouble with his parents,Les decides to take his Grandfather's Cadillac and go on a joyride with his friends Dean(Corey Feldman)and Charles(Michael Manasseri)and Les' dream girl Mercedes Lane(Heather Graham). It's going to be a wild night of laughs and insanity Les and the Cadillac.License To Drive is a terrific and hilarious Teen Comedy and is one of the better Teen movies of the 1980s that was the second movie starring the two Corey's Corey Haim and Corey Feldman and for 88 minutes offers nothing but fun and laughs. It's a movie that isn't trying to be thought-provoking or inventive,it's just a movie that tells you to turn off your brain for a while and just come along for the ride(no pun intended). License To Drive is a movie that is from the very start is outlandish and takes the viewer on a wild journey that gets more insane and over the top with a relentless energy and never stops until the end. This movie doesn't rely on realism or true life accuracy just lighthearted fun that will have you laughing. And while License To Drive maybe a little predictable and have tons of trademarks and familiar aspects that are in other Teen movies you as the viewer are entertained throughout and there is never a dull moment. The Comedy and laughs in License To Drive are funny and memorable because the Comedy has a wonderful balance of being simple one minute and being surreal and ridiculous the next with some characters and moments that are exaggerated and with dialog that is witty and clever. The Comedy and laughs are nonstop and incredible. What also makes License To Drive work so well is the structure of the film which is two sections. The first section is showing Les trying to ask out Mercedes and taking his driving test at the DMV and trying to get his license. The scenes at the DMV as well as Les driving on the road are pure Comedy gold and we as the viewer relate to Les' nervousness of trying to get a license. The second section of the film is about Les' joyride in the Cadillac with Mercedes and his friends and taking a big risk driving without a license. With the second section Les and his Grandfather's Cadillac take a lot bumps and bruises and even gets into a car chase which is one of the funniest moments in the film. The moments in the second section make the moments the first half look normal and regular in comparison and things get much worse for Les and the Cadillac. You can almost say that the second half of the movie is not only a Comedy but also an adventure with laughs,thrills and stunts. When we see the main character Les Anderson and the chaos that he has to deal with we connect and relate to him because he's a typical teenager who is in a crazy situation that is beyond his control and when we watch the film we are in the car with him and we see what he sees and we as the viewer all ask will he get the car back to his house before his parents find out? When you see the film you will find out what happens. The ending of License To Drive is truly wonderful,hilarious and filled with surprises and laughs that will put smiles on viewers faces. A great ending.The cast is great. Corey Haim is terrific and hilarious as Les Anderson,with Haim bringing Humor and a likable charm to the role. Corey Feldman is wonderful and funny as Dean,Les' friend with Feldman having great scenes with Haim. Richard Masur(Mr Anderson)and Carol Kane(Mrs. Anderson)are fantastic as Les' parents. Heather Graham is great and beautiful as Mercedes,Les' dream girl. James Avery is outstanding and funny as Les' DMV examiner. Helen Hanft is sensational as Miss Hellberg,a woman that works at the DMV. Michael Manasseri is memorable as Charles,Les' other friend. Nina Siemaszko does a fine job as Natalie Anderson,Les' twin sister. Parley Bear(Grandpa Anderson),Christopher Burton(Rudy Anderson),Grant Heslov(Karl),M.A Nickles(Paolo)and Harry Alan Miller(Drunk Driver)give good performances as well.The direction by Greg Beeman is great with Beeman always moving the camera and giving the movie a wonderful style and pace. Fantastic direction,Beeman.The score by Jay Fergusan is good,light and matches the film perfectly. The soundtrack is sensational with songs by Billy Ocean(Get Outta My Dreams,Get Into My Car),New Edition(Crucial),Frank Sinatra(That's Life,Strangers In The Night),Nia Peeples(Trouble),INXS(New Sensation),DJ Jazzy Jeff & The Fresh Prince(Jazzy's In The House),Belinda Carlisle(I Feel Free)and more.In final word,if you love Teen Films,Comedies or The Two Coreys,I highly suggest you see License To Drive,a wonderful and hilarious Teen Comedy from the 1980s that is worth your time. Highly Recommended. 10/10.

Driving for the teen meant the freedom to go where ever you wanted or needed to go, any time you want. But also for most it was a ticket to being cool. This is an 80's gem that I like and is a gem that has driven under the radar, it's not to say it wasn't popular for it's time but like certain vintage cars it became forgotten.There really not much to say, I really like the plot it's a simple no nonsense plot which is what I like about comedies. Yeah there is absurdity but that's part of what makes it funny. The music soundtrack I think is really good, I like the end credit theme song from Billy Ocean Out of my Dreams which is one of my personal favorite 80's songs.I really like the two Corries, shame both couldn't of kept up on the high end of their carriers, but oh well. Corey Halm whom sadly is no longer with us is great, I've always liked this actor he can do both comedic and serious roles. But anyway I like his character Les Anderson whom is a typical geek that is on a quest to be cool and to get the girl, is ill confidant always struggling to prevent disappointment and being uncool. Dean by Corey Feldman is great, his character just cracks me up, he has some of the best lines in the film my favorite was that speech he gave which is both funny but kinda true at the same time about life. His character is also on the same quest as Les but he is a little more confidant, and a person that is more loose and a bit wild.The adventures with the car are fun, fast paced and hilarious, it's pretty random what these characters run into. I don't want to give too much away, but my favorites are the infamous jump toward the Shaky's Pizza place (damn I miss that restaurant) and the solid car chase for the drunk driver.Though I think what really makes this comedy stand out is on it's emphasize and sympathy factor. Les's predicaments are both funny and a little sad at the same time because most of us have been there, or have felt it. From Les taking that drivers test and under pressure of failing. The threat of getting busted by your parents for something you know you shouldn't do, which results in Les saying my favorite line Im so dead, their going to have to bury me twice. yeah I sometimes thought those words from time to time. But just simply the desire for the first time to taste freedom, to not just be cool but feel cool, as well as just to simply drive.Overall License to Drive has plenty of millage for fun which makes it worth a test drive.Rating 3 stars "},{"Title":"A GOOD light hearted movie you gotta watch!!!","Date":"21 September 2007","Score":"","Genre":"Comedy","Review":" Well,I got hold of this movie from one of my friends and started watching it without any great expectations.

No dick jokes, no fart jokes, just the good old problem of the main character trying not to get grounded.License To Drive is an overlooked little movie from that genre. It's no great classic like Ferris Bueller's Day Off, but it does have its charms. The two Coreys are in there as is a VERY young Heather Graham.The characters and the plot are totally unbelievable and there are no real laugh out loud-moments, but that doesn't matter so much.

But this does not stop him from picking up his new girlfriend (Heather Graham) and his friends (including Corey Feldman) and going on an all-night adventure. This movie is so 80s it hurts! I love 80s movies. I love Corey Feldman movies. So, yes, I love this movie. My friend Jason and I watched this and could predict the entire plot as it went along (so many 80s clich√©s, so little time). You would think this predictability would make it a bad movie, but it only made it better. There should be an 80s movie Bingo with things like mobsters chase kids or kid steals car from parents on it... between this film and Adventures in Babysitting, you would have a blackout.I wonder one thing would Corey Feldman be better as the lead actor rather than the supporting cast? He is funnier and more likable than Haim (and more handsome), but can he carry a film? I guess we will never know. And luckily Heather Graham spends the majority of this movie in the trunk of a car. I know many people think she is hot, but even in the 80s when she was still young she was just not attractive to me. For the 80s, give me Ione Skye or Jennifer Jason Leigh or Elisabeth Shue, please.But yeah, if you like car chases and the dad from Fresh Prince of Bel-Air, this is your movie. If you like Carol Kane playing a pregnant woman, this is your movie. If you like excessive vulgarity and sex, this is not your movie (sorry, this is not Fast Times).I recommend this film. Heck, rent a few Feldman classics. Lost Boys, Goonies and this are all great. Maybe even Dream a Little Dream if you plan to be up all night.

After picking up his two best friends (Corey Feldman, Michael Manasseri) they head out for what's suppose to be a good time but they hit one disaster after another. This was one of my favorite movies before I hit 16-years-old because it was always a fun movie to watch and fantasize about what my first day out with a driver's license would be like. Watching the film now I was a little surprised to see how well it stood up and especially by how many of the jokes still pack a lot of laughs. This movie was clearly made to get the two Corey's together and they do a terrific job but the main reason for this is that the screenplay is so spot on and smart in terms of what happens. I think the screenplay perfectly builds up that teen spirit of being a dork and wanting the most beautiful girl in school. It perfectly builds up all the fun stuff that one does when they get a car. It perfectly builds up the two friend characters who are constantly want to do more and more simply because they're not the ones who own the car. The performances in the films are extremely good with Haim doing a great job with the nerd role. That shyness and laid back style of his perfectly fits this character and it's really the perfect mix for all the craziness that's going on in the movie. Feldman, to no shock, plays the wilder one and the two of them blending their styles makes it easy to see why they were so popular together. Graham isn't too bad either as she gets quite a few good scenes. Another major plus is Richard Masur and Carol Kane who play Haim's parents. They are both perfect in their roles and really add a lot of great laughs and especially Masur who pretty much steals the film with his lovable bear type performance. The soundtrack is totally 80s with The Breakfast Club doing a cover of The Beatles' Drive My Car and we've got Billy Ocean's smash Get Out of My Car and even a couple Sinatra songs added for great effect. This film isn't an Oscar-winner and it will never be confused as one. It is a great throwback to the 80s with some extremely good performances and a winning screenplay and that alone makes it worth viewing.
