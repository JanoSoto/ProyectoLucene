It involves demons, Pinhead, some French people, architecture and outer space. Pretty good deal.This film is my favorite in the Hellraiser series. By itself, there is not much going on. I can understand why many think this film is weak. If I just watched it without the entire series, I would be like, what the heck? But I think this really ties the first four films together, explaining how everything fits.I have read reviews that say the film is inconsistent and that it does not line up with the other films. I say hogwash. The film makes perfect sense. And it lines up with the others just fine. I guess you could say things like how did the box get from x to y, but I think it is pretty clear. The French guy had it, then it went into circulation, then the Cottons had it in parts 1 and 2, then the news reporter in part 3, and she buried it in the cement where it was pulled out this time. What is not to understand? I could say the space aspect was cheesy. Leprechaun has been to space, and later Jason Voorhees went to space. Others probably did, too, that I cannot think of offhand. But unlike Leprechaun, this made sense... it was actually central to the plot and could not have been done on Earth in any conceivable manner. So the space thing is not so bad.As I mentioned in my review for Hellraiser 3, I dislike how writer Peter Atkins introduced new cenobites. This movie has more, including twins and a former demon (which really makes no sense to me). What determines who becomes a cenobite? Pinhead? Maybe this will be explained in a later film, but probably not, and it is not really explained here.The director disowned this film due to massive re-shoots he had no part in. I, for one, would love to see his version. While I have already said this is my favorite, perhaps the other is something worth checking out. Also, it would stifle some of those critics who think it was reassembled as a senseless pile of bangers and mash. I disagree with those critics and would love to see them eat their words.After seeing parts 1 and 2 (and presumably 3), watch this. Do not listen to the nay-sayers. If you want to know how the whole Pinhead, box and whatnot started, this is the film to explain it to you. (You might ask how Pinhead got out before the box was created, but you would be silly, because he was not born yet.) I support this one and you should, too.

He has commandeered a space station (that he himself designed) for this task. He opens the box, lets the demons out, and is detained (people begin to investigate his questionable behavior on the ship) before he can capture them. Almost the entire film is told in the form of a story which he tells the people holding him, in an effort to get them to let him go so he can finish his work. Needless to say, it takes a lot of gory deaths to convince them. There is a small bit of tension created by the fact that the entire time he is telling the guards what is going on, the Cenobites are out and are on the ship. However, this is largely forgotten about for the majority of the film because so much of it takes place in 18th century France, the time when the box was created. Basically, some toymaker makes the box, opens it, demons show up, and they terrorize his family for generations. You'd think they'd be grateful because he let them out into the world of the living. Anyway, the guy in 2127 has taken upon himself the task of building a NEW box that will be sort of an antidote to the first box, one that is designed so that it can actually trap LIGHT inside. It's an interesting enough story, and it was actually fairly entertaining, but the film itself was still somewhat lacking. The acting was pretty bad (but at least Ashley Laurence was blissfully absent again), and there wasn't much effort put into the directing. The movement back and forth from the distant future to the distant past was also a bit detrimental at times to the tension of the story, but luckily the film did present a few cool new cenobites (one that was satisfactorily created out of a couple of idiot security guards), and Bloodline also displayed probably one of Pinhead's best performances ever. I would say that Bloodline is more of an informational movie than a good Hellraiser movie. While it is interesting to watch, it is almost more informational than entertaining. So even though the movie itself may have been disappointing, I think that it is a good addition to the series as a whole. It works better within the Hellraiser series than it does by itself.

Hellraiser 3 was the first in the personalization of Pinhead's character. Hellraiser 4 Bloodline gives us the history of the box, the curse upon the family of the one who created it, and the fate of the descendant who created the UN-box; the reverse to the original which will close the gates to Hell for all time.Some critics have given this movie low marks due to the Pinhead in Space factor, claiming that it was unnecessary and that it lent nothing but cheese to the story. Others have labeled the vehicle as a franchise contrivance. I must say that I agree with neither statement. Space was the ideal place for this sequence to have occurred. The plot would have suffered greatly had they tried this particular ideology on the Earth's surface. Also, this was a hard movie to make and I found nothing whatsoever contrived about it. It flowed smoothly and told the story beautifully; albeit darkly.This movie also faced some real editing problems while in production. It seems the director had his name removed from this movie (or changed) after scenes depicting a deeper story line and stronger ideologies, were deleted.I give this wonderful installment high marks!

For me Bloodlines tells the story of the puzzle box and for me as a huge Clive Barker fan it resolves the questions Where was the puzzle build?, Why was it build? and Who made it?The true Hellraiser movies are 1 and 2, the third one comes like a baseball player sliding in to home plate just inches from being struck out...but it works. And bloodlines totally compliments these, because it's not just about Pinhead, the main character in this one is the Puzzle Box.That's my 2 cents.

Like many third sequels, it takes the path of going back to the series' roots; thus tracing the origins of the central prop; the box that opens the gates to hell. The film starts aboard a space ship, and we witness the seemingly insane ramblings of a madman. He then tells the story of the curse on his bloodline; starting off with the toy maker who made the box and opened the gates to hell. The man plans to create a box to counter the original, and send the demons back to hell. The rest of the more modern sequels follow plots that have nothing to do with the original films, so at least this one doesn't suffer from that. The plot isn't completely relevant to the story of Frank Cotton in the first Hellraiser, but at least it isn't merely another episode of Pinhead taking some guy's soul. On the subject of Pinhead; this film takes place in the time that he was still evil, rather than being a mere shadow of the cenobite that we all know and love. Pinhead plays a major part in this movie, and that's always welcome as far as I'm concerned.Bloodline is more of a fan's movie than the rest of the series. That, therefore, means that if you haven't seen, or didn't like the previous three films; there really isn't much on offer here. Things that have been explained in the first three aren't re-explained here, and therefore it's really important that the other films are seen before this one. Bloodline is surprisingly gruesome, and a lot of the film is very dark and bloody. No bad thing as far as I'm concerned, as I go into Hellraiser films expecting to see gore, and tend to be pleased when they deliver. The acting here is largely terrible, with only Doug Bradley saving the film in that respect. He only does what he's done before - but it really does make the movie. It's surprising how much this deviates from the original; but I'd rather see a sequel do something a little different than merely retread the same ground, as far too many do. That's the reason I aren't slamming this film like a great deal of other's are. It may not be great, and doesn't change the fact that the series dried up after Hellbound...but at least it's not a total dead loss. "},{"Title":"Very well done!

Seeing this undeservedly LOW score here made me feel that I really had to 'say' something.First off, YES, I am indeed a BIG fan of the first three films; before these just recently came out on glorious Blu-ray, years ago, I even sprang for the UK Puzzle Box set of the first three films (mainly because at the time UNCUT versions were not available here in the States and also for the full commentaries and the bonus DVD that came with it  ) Now, I know it is hard to believe, but I just NOW for the very first time saw this one, part 4; the reason being is that from some casual stuff I had read, I was under the impression that pretty much all the other 'HELLRAISER' films were not very good. Well... Let me tell you, I was extremely surprised and impressed! As I said, compared to all the REALLY AWFUL Horror films out there that are excruciating and badly made, and that is most of them, I was surprised that this one was made quite well. Okay, so a lot of the fans are sort of put off because it is really different from the other films. Fine... Isn't the POINT to try to come up with different angles and new approaches rather than just remaking the same film again and again...? I thought it was genuinely very creative and kept my attention very much so throughout the film. Sure, okay, it starts in space and your rolling your eyes, thinking Oh great,'LEPRECHAUN 3' ) well, it works; it really does. Obviously a LOT of thought was put into the timeline and the mythology of the box, etc., not to mention the follow through at the end. Sure, it wrapped it up rather quickly and left it kind of ambiguous, but so what?! Yes, of COURSE it doesn't have the intensity of the original or even the complexity of the next two films, but to me I was mainly impressed by their not only coming up with the new idea to show the origins, etc., but also I honestly felt that everything that made up the film was done very well considering that it is a damn 'HORROR' movie!  ) I gave it a good, strong '8' which it fully deserves considering the context and type of film.

The plot of this film starts in 2127, and then rolls back to the years 1996 and the 18th century.The last descendant of the Merchant family, Dr. Paul Merchant (Bruce Ramsay), is trying to build a more efficient box so that the demons that Duc de L'Isle (Mickey Cottrell) brought up after toymaker Phillip L'Merchant makes a toy box. The first demon that comes out is Angelique (Valentina Vargas).First thing, it's 18th century, they didn't see demons as the guys that walked around in leather. The saw demons as the guys with horns and large canines, and most descriptions of them even have long sharp claws. Okay so we visit 1996 where one of Merchant's descendent's has just finished a building with designs of the box everywhere. Soon John Merchant (Bruce Ramsay), his wife Bobbi (Kim Myers) and their son Jack (Courtland Mead) meet Pinhead (Doug Bradley of course) and Angelique.I'm not going to give away the ending, but I will say that Steven Yagher (Alan Smithee) directed this fine.

But then again, this is the kind of scene that should be in horror movies more, instead nowadays we have to put up with crappy remakes of old slasher movies that are made with no intelligence whatsoever. Another thing that creeped me out the fact that the characters especially John Merchant, a family man who has a wife and a kid where you actually felt terrified for them, you'd expect those chains come from nowhere again and rip their skin off. The atmosphere that surrounded his family was chilling.The cinematography and editing in the movie was perfect to show a hellish like atmosphere that is continuous in the movie while in the scenes with the cenobites and Angelique. The music as well is portrayed brilliantly, I thought the director did very well. The make-up and gore was nothing to make it seem fake, I actually didn't notice anything odd about it, it seemed very well done for this direct to video release.Some people are against this movie that its getting to the point where Pinhead is in space, I did notice this, however still after watching the first 3 movies, i didn't think it was that bad. I thought it worked, the story didn't rely too much that it was in space, it was mostly flashbacks of Merchant (who has built a space station and use it to close the gates of Hell forever and destroy the cenobites) to the curse of La 'Merchant - the man who made the box, and the curse of his bloodline by the Cenobites. It shows the fate of Pinhead seeing that this is far into the future.All in all, it was a good horror movie, but if you're easily offended by mutilation in a twisted sick and grotesque degrading way by means of chains and machinery coming out of nowhere, then this might not be for you "},{"Title":"Love this movie","Date":"17 May 2006","Score":"4 out of 5 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Horror, Sci-Fi","Review":" This movie had its inconsistencies, but though some have said they like it least, I still enjoy it more than 'Inferno'. Any time-spanning film that takes in a handful of centuries is going to be quick with each one by necessity, or the movie would be six hours long. And I did like the space stuff, but I have a bone to pick with the idea of Merchant's Elysium device, and I'm not sure that should be capable of killing Pinhead. But even if it did, his death wouldn't kill Leviathan, or all the rest of the Cenobites who weren't there. In spite of that, the current Merchant seems convinced that he's vanquishing the enemy for all time. O_o Angelique in human form sort of annoys me &#150; I like her better once Pinhead makes her into a Cenobite. But one of the most entertaining aspects of 'Bloodline' is the rivalry between them, as well as something I'm going to call attraction/repulsion. For most of the movie, if Pinhead and Angelique are on screen together, she starts being arrogant and coquettish, and he starts behaving as if he's out to seduce her. But underlying all of this is the mood that they might actually hate each other on some level, as they fall into a contest of wills over how to proceed with John Merchant. Over all, the actors are achieving multiple levels of mood and tone at once in each of those scenes.I also rather liked how Mr. Ramsay managed to be the same man and very different men, each time he played a new successor to the Merchant curse, neatly reinventing himself each time.And doesn't everyone love the Chatterer Beast? A boy and his dog. The humor of seeing Pinhead stroking a dove only to toss it to his pet was great. And the line, Ready for something &#150; that screams? was brilliant. I don't know if it was in the script to make that slight pause in the line, or if Doug threw that in himself, but it makes the line even better. It conveys a quiet delight in what he intends to go do, and demonstrates covertly (since he's generally rather overt) his immense power.

The real name of the director for BLOODLINE is Kevin Yagher best known as being behind the make up effects artist on the NIGHTMARE OF ELM ST movies . Considering the director used the name  Alan Smithee  and BLOODLINE was the last HELLRAISER film to be released in the cinemas the omens weren't good but I was pleasantly surprised . It's certainly not Oscar winning material but neither is it a totally redundant horror movie The story starts with a police unit turning up at a space station in the 22nd Century and right away I was expecting an ALIENS clone with Cenobites . If this is what you're expecting you won't be entirely disappointed but for the most part screenwriter Peter Atkins does try and flesh out the mythology of the Cenobites by setting the story mainly in the 18th Century France and 20th century New York . The French sequences are somewhat confusing since it suggests the puzzle boxes used since the first film were actually created by a toymaker and not by the Cenobites themselves . Atkins is less successful in explaining how the box ties in with the creation of the Cenobite race but does at least point out how the building seen at the end of HELLRAISER 3 has the same architecture as the boxes Interestingly the original director of was to be Guillermo Del Toro but he turned it down . This film would have suited his style with its grotesque imagery but Yagher does well and puts the budget on screen . I was amazed that the budget only cost $4 million . The space scenes are convincing and the movie is shot very effectively . The only real problem I had was with Bruce Ramsey as Dr Paul Merchantin the 22nd Century who gives a very poor wooden performance All in all HELLRAISERBLOODLINE is an entertaining horror romp . Comparing it to the original HELLRAISER from 1987 is similar to comparing James Whale's FRANKENSTEIN to some of the later films in the Universal franchise .

It seems the producers (pinhead) are out to destroy or at least put the fans through hell, after opening (watching) the mythical box. In my opinion, it is Rick Bota who is the real Pinhead, that let us suffer! I think they are out to remove pinhead completely from the series as he is getting less and less airtime.

The initial atmosphere and setting by Clive Barker has completely vanished, yet the morbid surrounding remains and several sequences are still very creepy and unsettling. Hellraiser Bloodline contains quite a lot of exquisite slaughtering and the charismatic presence of Pinhead (Doug Bradley) still is an extra horror-value. Pinhead &#150; accompanied by a pet puppy this time &#150; still knows how to kill&#133;too bad he talks too much and his vicious speeches tend to get boring quickly. Best aspects in this production are the newly introduced `cenobites' and the occult Parisian portrait. Giant turn-offs are the weak script, the absence of the typical macabre humor and the lack of references to Barker's initial masterpiece. Although not highly memorable itself, Bloodline stands as the last watchable Hellraiser film. After this sequel, the series went downhill completely. So far, 2 more sequels came out (2 more are still in process) and neither of those is worth seeing. HellraiserBloodline suffered from a lot of production difficulties and the director eventually preferred to be credited as Alan Smithee&#133;Meaning he doesn't want to be remembered as the director of it.

One thing i did notice if anyone else thinks the same comment and let us know, i found that in this movie pin heads IQ went down big time like his so evil and empty in this movie which is good makes him ruthless but sooo sooo dumb. His great in this movie but he doesn't really give paul merchant much of a fight instead he just blabbers and blabbers about how earth is a garden of flesh, this is near the end like hello didn't he really really want merchants ancestor to help him make a bigger door so that the cenobites could come in and out as they pleased and not like insects that sneak in the cracks, this was before his ancestors wife sends them back. I would be like okay lets start from were we left off as soon as i was summoned instead we see pin head near the end talk a lot of crap which is great dialogue about how theirs only darkness and no light. and wastes his time. you would think that someone that knows your fear and knows what your thinking of like he did with the twins would suspect something twisted was up he got his ass whooped way too easy if you ask me but then again its the writers fault really not his. apart from that this film rocks the feeling stays with you long after its finished and i'm referring to the feeling you get with the last lines of dialogue before the ending i wont say too much more even tho i've said enough but i did warn that this review contained spoilers. for others that have seen this film share some insight of what you thought about the battle in space, by the way i've seen some crappy space movies like leprechaun 4 this movie actually works really well in space as for the location i think who ever thought of the idea originally got it spot on. this movie rocks!!!. its definitely better than hellraiser 3 but like i said before we needed more quick action from pin head instead we got him talking way too much.

These are the guidelines that should be followed when occurrences like this happen. Of course we all know that's rarely the case except for the few. Most money hungry studios end up taking the full reign of the production and end up demanding the final result being fairly an exact copy of previous entries made or drastically changed the concept itself. Thus leading to the trend of diminishing returns. For Clive Barker's Hellraiser (1987) franchise, the trend is mostly the same, except the issues are in other places this time.Compared to Hellraiser III Hell on Earth (1992), this entry doesn't really surpass it, but it does at least feel more on track than the prior one does. Originally Kevin Yagher (a make-up and special effects artist who had experience in other horror films) was set to direct as his debut film. Unfortunately, Miramax Studios, which then owned the rights fought with Yagher, causing him to quit. However, one man who hasn't left since Hellraiser II Hellbound (1988) was writer Peter Atkins, who once again penned the script. In this chapter, the year is 2127 and audiences are introduced to Dr. Merchant (Bruce Ramsay) an inventor who has discovered a way to destroy Pinhead (Doug Bradley) and his followers forever. Regrettably, he is stopped before he is able to finish by a group of soldiers who came to take him away. To stall time, Merchant convinces Rimmer (Christine Harnos) to listen to why he needs to finish what he was doing. The story Merchant tells is how the Cenobites were first released and how they connect to his family ties.The fact that Atkins went in even further than before to explain the back story to Pinhead and his origins is again commendable, but sadly this new information totally contradicts the three films before it. None of the main characters in the prior entries were related to Merchant, so why did their fate have them come in contact with Pinhead? Also what about the multiple boxes that Dr. Channard had in his office from the second film? If these boxes act as portals, what makes you think destroying one box will keep Pinhead out forever? It just doesn't add up. Along with that is a new pseudo-villain named Angelique (Valentina Vargas) who also has a past with Merchant, but only him. Of the characters in the story, the only people that matter and viewers will enjoy is Dr. Merchant, Angelique and Pinhead. Bruce Ramsay (who ends up playing different versions of himself) manages to at least be competent in his role and certainly more convincing than Terry Farrell from the previous movie. As for Vargas and Bradley, they both looked like they enjoyed their roles. Doing all kinds of evil acts and such.On the flip side, the rest of the cast is completely forgettable. There is no character development, not even for Rimmer who listens to Dr. Merchant. There's also a young Adam Scott and an older Kim Myers (from A Nightmare on Elm Street 2 Freddy's Revenge (1985)) and they too have no real significant importance. But aside from characters, Atkins did change a number of things for the better. One being the tone; the third movie had a completely different tone to that of the first two. Many fans took it as too goofy and cheesy where Pinhead was portrayed more as a generic slasher villain. Here, Pinhead still kills just cause, but he's not as blood hungry either. Another plus is the creativeness of the cenobite designs, which unlike the third film looked quite gimmicky. Here, they look more like what Pinhead's followers would look like. Then again, fans may also complain because there really isn't a lot of new additions. Throughout the whole film, only three new cenobites appear of which one wasn't even human and they also don't receive a lot of screen time. Along with that is a possible dislike for the smaller amount of gore too. With that it may not be as scary either.Yet, the kill scenes are still quite gruesome. Another interesting edition to the mix of the franchise is the use of CGI, which doesn't look that bad. It's used minimally which is how it should be used. The cinematography shot by Gerry Lively is a slight improvement over his work in Hellraiser III Hell on Earth (1992). This time instead of showing Pinhead in the sunlight all the time, he is kept in the shadows and this helps him feel more mysterious and dangerous. Finally for the musical score, Daniel Licht who would later be known for his music in the Dexter (2006) TV show composed the tracks. Thankfully, Licht exceeds Randy Miller's score from the prior film by adding new themes for the cenobites and making a variation of Christopher Young's original theme that was created from the first film. Much of these tracks use the same string build up, choral echoes and percussion but its the deviations that make it more appealing to listen to than recycled tracks.It still doesn't anywhere match the first two original movies and most will probably find it equal to that of the Hellraiser III Hell on Earth (1992) quality, but even for the production troubles that it had and nonsensical story telling, it can be a more entertaining watch. Although the likable cast is few, it is made up with more back-story, a better- written tone, appropriate costume design, acceptable special effects that don't look dated and a better film score.

One of the finer points about this one is the actuality of this one tying up the series-long thread of where exactly the box that summons them actually came from. Finally getting that sorted out while also showcasing the connection to their dimension and ours through the rather chilling summoning ceremony on display which is quite fun and finally solves that burning question in the series about its origins. Also on display is the rather impressive sequence showing the creation of a double-headed Cenobite in grand fashion, a lengthy and bloody sequence that truly revels in the horror of the intent behind this sequence. That also brings about the impressive special effects and the blood and gore, which are rather impressive since there's not a lot of screen-time devoted to them so instead it really makes the most of such scenes by really going all-out in here. That does bring up one of the few flaws in here, with this one coming across as way too overfilled with the family drama to make better use of the Cenobites and their actions. There's not a whole lot of time here with the creatures due to the films' incessantly annoying habit of switching through history to keep the story going. There's not much about this one that doesn't make sense because of its needless switching back-and-forth in these time periods as this just becomes endlessly convoluted and overdrawn which doesn't have to be that way as the story could've been told in a much simpler fashion. Otherwise, this one wasn't all together that bad.Rated R Graphic Violence, Graphic Language, Nudity and a brief sex scene.

Executives who know little about art thinking they know what the people they really want is both amusing and frustrating. It hurts even more when we're dealing with a film that's part of a beloved series. Dimension Films has been known for having some problematic productions. Few are as interesting as what went on during the making of the third 'Hellraiser' sequel. One can only imagine the amount of tension there was between the director and the studio there was.The franchise created by Clive Barker was becoming more successful with each installment. The first two had been made independently, while III was the first with a studio involved. For what was to be the final installment, the filmmakers had a tall order to fill. A winning concept, a talented effects artist in the director's chair and a script by 'Hellbound' and 'Hell On Earth' writer Peter Atkins were all good signs. Alas, the studio had to put their noses in and make changes against the director's wishes. The surprising thing is that the end result is actually quite good.Pros Good show by the entire cast. Though no match for Christopher Young's work, the score here is excellent. Neat, not to mention ambitious premise. The parts of Peter Atkins' script used are excellent. Gorgeous cinematography. Fabulous production design for all three time periods. Flows at a good pace. Some really killer effects, practical and visual.Cons Far too short for ideas and characters to fully develop. Some of the visual effects look dated. Has signs of studio interference, like in the editing.

It focuses on the puzzle box itself, otherwise known as the Lament Configuration, that caused all of the trouble in the first place. It was created centuries ago by a toy maker who knew not what he was doing, as nefarious types were out to use it to unleash demons such as Pinhead upon the world. The back stories are framed by sequences set in the future where the latest descendant of that long ago toy maker is attempting to make things right again with a puzzle box of his own. Now, it almost certainly would have been better had director Kevin Yagher, a top makeup and special effects designer, been able to stick with his own vision, as extensive re-shoots were ordered, re-shoots that didn't involve him, and as a result he took his own name off the picture in favour of the notorious pseudonym Alan Smithee. And the story does indeed feel thin, not fully realized, and too rushed. Overall this is a hard movie to really get interested in, as too many of the characters and actors on hand are of the nondescript kind. Doug Bradley as Pinhead, of course, is an exception, and is magnetic as always, sinking his teeth into his literate dialogue. And Valentina Vargas is mildly amusing and definitely sexy as his ironically named cohort Angelique. There's just not much oomph to this thing, no standout set pieces, and no real sense of overwhelming doom or menace. In fact, it's tiresome at times. The gore and designs are a highlight (although one can tell this was done on a budget), with Pinhead provided with an effective canine companion. There are interesting ideas here, and hints of what could have been, but from start to finish this is purely on the routine side. Five out of 10.

The only part of this movie i didn't like was the cenobite's dog. Other than that the whole thing was great. I give it a 4 out of 5. Intelligent and insane. Clive Barker truly mastered the art of horror with this movie. And to the person who said Pinhead's speeches get boring They show the part of the character we rarely see. In all the other movies he's pretty much quiet and does very little. Those speeches make this movie intelligent, where the others are made for their gore effects and not their plot lines.

Besides being held up a year, the film went through various script changes, re-shoots & re-editing, resulting in a somewhat uneven film, that at times feels rather choppy in area's. The films plot & execution is certainly a mixed bag in terms of direction. While Special Effects artist KEVIN YAGHER is billed as director, he walked off during mid production, after being disgruntled with the final product & slapped the ALAN SMITHEE pseudonym on the film. While HALLOWEEN THE CURSE OF MICHAEL MYERS helmer JOE CHAPPELLE was later called in to do re-shoots & re-edit the film, with the help of screenwriter RAND RAVICH, who re-wrote original writer PETER ATKINS version of the film. Interestingly enough Screenwriter RAND RAVICH also did some uncredited re-writes on HALLOWEEN THE CURSE OF MICHAEL MYERS a film that suffered the same fate as BLOODLINE. None of this is all that surprising, since the directing style noticeably varies at times in various sections of the film. While some of the direction is really good, other parts of the film, feels rather hackneyed in approach. As a result of this, HELLRAISER BLOODLINE comes off as a rather underwhelming affair at times. It makes very little sense, with plot lines noticeably being dropped, while others are not fully developed. Making it a rather routine effort. BLOODLINE certainly has the best plot out any of the HELLRAISER movies, but it is never taken full advantage of. The segment set in the 18th century tends to suffer more than anything else in the film, not only is it brief, but many of it's more captivating sequences were left on the cutting room floor, making the whole segment underwhelming in it's execution. The segment set in present day, is a little more interesting in the first half, but quickly degenerates into the usual stalk & chase horror movie that concludes unsatisfying. While the space station segment comes off as a rather cheap looking B movie rip-off of ALIEN, that just seems to be getting interesting when it ends abruptly & confusingly. It also appears to be missing certain scenes, not to mention any kind of real suspense or atmosphere. Angelique the lead demon who plays a major part in the first two segments winds being underused here, she turns up as a cenobite follower of Pinhead's & there's never any scenes where she confronts the space station hero like she did his ancestors. The segment ends with a shot of the dark prince of hell himself Pinhead being finally destroyed, uttering the words Amen before his death. It seems the film-makers were hinting at something here. One comes up with the crazy notion that the dark soulless villain of the series, may have repented & asked for forgiveness for his many years of indulging in evil, but it's rather useless to speculate. Angelique wanting to become human was an interesting little subplot, but that to is seemingly dropped midway into the film, as is the scenes that suggest that present day descendant John Merchant is having an affair with Angelique but this is never fully developed. The plot holes come in with the following At one point after his wife & son are abducted by Pinhead, John leaves Angelique to go looking for them, terrified of who has them & where they are, but how did John know they were in trouble? Did Angelique tell him something? Why did Angelique summon Pinhead to help her, when she really didn't need him at all? It seems pointless especially later on in the film, when it looks like she is set to betray him by forcing John to open the portals of hell for her, before Pinhead showed up? & what became of Angelique & the cenobite twin brothers, after they kill the head commander of the troops sent to arrest Merchant's ancestor in the space station? They just collect the box & disappear, with their deaths never being shown? the whole ending of the film feels incomplete, plus Angeliques feud with the Merchant family is never resolved satisfyingly & what is her connection to Pinhead? it seems they know each other, but chronologically this would be impossible, since Angelique left hell in the 18th century, while Eliiot Spencer became Pinhead in the early days of World War I? The performances for the most parts really aren't all that great & that maybe due to the constant script re-writes that went on during production. The only ones that really shine here, are CHRISTINE HARNOS & DOUG BRADLEY, They make for a fun set of villains & we finally do get some questions answered as to who made the box & whyAll in all, HELLRAISER BLOODLINE is worth a look for horror fans. Despite word of mouth & its bad history, it really isn't that bad of a movie & remains fairly watchable for what it is, but coming in at an 85 minute running time, a film like this should have been executed on a far more epic & grand scale, especially the ending, since it is supposed to be Pinhead's last outing on his path of destruction. But it all comes off as a watered down film. As it is, it remains a very passive effort.

Given the low budget and messy production, it's no minor miracle that it works as well as it does.Hellraiser Bloodline tells both the beginning and ending of the story Clive Barker unleashed on the big screen in 1987. Not only do we find out how the puzzle box was created, as well as by whom and for what initial purpose, but we also get a front row seat for its destruction, providing a sense of closure to the franchise.other sequels followed, but by jumping so far into the future for the outer space-set finale, Dimension Films was able to make the rare franchise sequel that actually feels like the end of the franchise. Not only is the puzzle box destroyed but so too is Pinhead, and there's something to be said for the definitive nature of Bloodline. In many ways, it's sort of the last Hellraiser sequel that matters.Ambition and a respectable amount of imagination are also on display in Hellraiser Bloodline's standout makeup effects, particularly when it comes to the birth of a siamese Cenobite that Pinhead creates by literally twisting two twin brothers together. The film also introduces the awesome Chatterer Beast, a hellish pet hound composed of human flesh. He doesn't get nearly enough screen-time, but he's pretty damn cool.Hellraiser Bloodline tries way harder than most horror sequels.

The droid succeeds only to be blown to pieces as a most unsatisfying victim, as Pinhead puts it. Meanwhile, the station is stormed by a small group of Marines sent to capture Dr. Merchant for hijacking the very station he designed. He's captured before he can put his potential plan into action, and thus, pleads with them to allow him to finish his work. After enough pleading, he convinces the female marine to hear his story. Merchant tells of how his ancestor, Phillip L'Marchant (also played by Bruce Ramsay), created the puzzle box in the eighteenth century based on the specific instructions of the most famous magician in France, Duc De L'Isle (Mickey Cottrel). Phillip never could've imagined what it would unlock. De L'Isle used the box to bring forth a demon in a woman's skin, and named her Angelique (Valentina Vargas). Paul says that Phillip witnessed this devilry and attempted to undo it by designing the Elysium Configuration - something he would be incapable of implementing as it had to do with the reflecting of light beams to be a counteracting prison for these demons...the Cenobites. The design was passed down through the family's bloodline (hence, the subtitle), and eventually, the twentieith century descendant, John Merchant (Ramsay, again), a achitect / computer designer, had potentially built what could become the Elysium Configuration, but Pinhead states that it could be a very large doorway (the office bulding featured at the conclusion of the previous film). Angelique attempts to seduce its secrets from John, but Pinhead states that seduction is useless as pain and suffering are the way of hell now. Pinhead attempts to trap John by holding his family prisoner, but in the end, both sides lose. In the twenty-second century, Dr. Paul Merchant believes that he can destroy the Cenobites once and for all, but the marines' untimely arrival have prevented that. Naturally, no one believes his elaborate story, but he must find a way to destroy the Cenobites or else the bloodline will end with him.Barker's original vision was something far more grisly and seedy than what was shot. Still, the film holds together with a decent story. The scenes in eighteenth century France are probably the best in the film as they are the most Hellraiser-like. It also has the richest art direction, and actually contains no Pinhead. To me, it is the most fascinating segment of the film. Though, as the film goes on, we see the further divergence from the original, established mythology. Pinhead once again creates his own Cenobites despite not having the power to do so. Performance wise, Doug Bradley seems quite comfortable here, playing bringing back the coldness of the character.Bruce Ramsay shows a great flexiblity as he portrays Phillip, John, and Paul. Each one is a different type of character. Phillip being the niave little man, John being the protective father, and Paul being the intelligent and cunning one of the lot. I hand it to him for showing the diversity of his acting abilities.The overall style and look of the film is very slick and smooth. There's less artistry and more commercial sensibilities in place with the cinematography and direction.There are several cut scenes including Angelique's Party in the first time period, and in fact, the story was to be totally chronological instead of starting with Paul's narration from the future. More things were undoubtedly cut, and it would be wonderful to see a Director's Cut someday, but it seems highly unlikely. Also, these marines are idiots, and it would've been better if they were more like the Marines out of Aliens or the team from Predator. Capable, intelligent, believable, and highly aware. These marines are just meat ready to be ripped apart by Pinhead's chains. Even the grunts from Jason X would've been greatly better than these slaughtered lambs. Anyway, it had potential, and probably still does in that aforementioned, yet unseen director's cut. All that I will mention about Clive Barker's vision, if it had been adhered to, is it woulve' been a far more visceral and nasty film with Phillip L'Merchant being a highly disturbed serial killer obsessed with creating dozens of puzzle boxes, and a deeper, more textured backstory overall being explored. As it stands now, Hellraiser Bloodline fails in some places, has some shining moments, but all in all, still delivers some chilling scenes with a good story, great makeup work, and good visual effects.

And what a vision this could have been. Sadly the budget, and aforementioned studio interference renders it a run of the mill, rather underwhelming slasher movie with but a few moments of surprising creativity.Yagher had previously made a name for himself as a master of special effects, working on such titles as A Nightmare on Elm Street 2 Freddy's Revenge, Child's Play and The Hidden. He was so aghast at the changes imposed on Bloodline, he removed his name from it and replaced it with the Directors Guild of America approved pseudonym, Alan Smithee. Directors can do this when they feel that their artistic vision or creative control has been severely compromised by the interference of pesky studio executives more interested in money than creativity. Apparently many of Yagher's more elaborate designs and ideas never even made it to the screen, including Cenobites decked out in French period garb. When Yagher walked away from the project, just before it wrapped, Joe Chappelle was hired to film the remaining scenes, reshoot some material - including the narrative framing device onboard the space station - and tie everything up. Chappelle had previously directed the equally misguided- but- strangely-fascinating Halloween The Curse of Michael Myers.Again, as with the prior films, there is a strong sense of continuity present in Bloodline, and kudos must go to writer Peter Atkins, a veteran of the series at this stage, who, with the character of Angelique, creates what actually feels like a bona fide Clive Barker character. Alluring, seductive and deadly, she is a demon inhabiting the skin of a beautiful prostitute offered in sacrifice to her. When she emerges at the finale, complete with full-on Cenobite make-over, her appearance harks back to earlier female Cenobites, and reeks of the same morbid sensuality; a sensuality that was markedly absent from the prior instalment. Bloodline gets one thing right at least; it feels like a Clive Barker film. Albeit a rather flawed one. Bloodline was clearly intended to be the final installment in the flailing Hellraiser saga and in chronological order if watched as a prequel and a sequel its the final chapter of the hellraiser franchise.

Though the film got hacked up and reduced the plot to a mess (as only Dimension and Joe Chappelle could do it!), the multiple story lines stretched over three time periods makes for an interesting take on the Hellraiser mythos. It also features some slick gore and makeup gags, which comes as no surprise considering Kevin Yagher was at the helm (before he was unceremoniously dumped in post-production); A three part anthology spanning five centuries, it explores the origin of the puzzle boxes and the family that created them.The movie worked as an excellent slipcase for the entire series.

The image of a human body suspended by hooks is enough call to vomit. Subtitle suggests generations of evil. Story regards an ancient toymaker who made a cube that can summon and destroy demons. It is obvious to anyone after seeing the movie that this wasn't regarding a Rubics Cube. It might have been more interesting if it was. See if Pinhead can get all the colours matching. Anyway, a rescue team invades a space station and finds the film's narrator. Soon Pinhead and his demons arrive and make short work of them in all sorts of graphic ways that would create more vomit than an evening of heavy drinking. Filled with great visual elements matched with a screenplay overrun with idiocy. It assembles a bunch of nameless peons who die graphically for the sake of entertainment. To top it off this film is directed with the alias Alan Smithee, which means someone other than the audience hated it too. Bad acting headed by Doug Bradley as Pinhead and Valentina Vargas, Bruce Ramsay, Kim Myers, and Charlotte Chatton. While the original film is intriguing and creative with its visual elements, this third sequel is an exercise in gore and guts that belongs in a barf bag with viewer's results.

There is a single male adult on the station before it is boarded by armed, uniformed troops. The man attempts to manipulate a puzzle cube remotely. This does not go as expected.The man is Dr. Merchant, who designed the station for a company. The boarding party is from his company. They are attempting to figure out what is going on, and then to restore the profitability of the station. They imprison the doctor, then interrogate him.So, we start an ongoing set of pieces of flashback to some 400 years previous. Dr. Merchant's ancestor, Phillip le Merchant, after occult studies, constructed the first of the puzzle cubes that opened a passage to the cenobites to Earth. In 2127, Dr. Merchant was attempting to finish the process of closing that passage. Of course, the boarding party did not help.Phillip sells the cube to the Duc de l'Isle, an evil minded magician. The duke uses it in a number of bloody rituals conducted by him and Jacques over the murdered and dismembered body of a peasant girl. The rituals raise a demon. The duke is stupid enough to think he can command the demon, whom he names Angelique.Phillip tries to get some support for stopping the duke, but the 18th century is in the Age of Reason, so no one really believes him. Still, one of this friends tells him to design a mechanism that will close the doors to the demons. Phillip sets about to do this.Phillip clearly failed in his own time. Angelique meets Phillip's descendant John in the 20th century. He is a famous architect, whom Angelique hopes to recruit. Evidently John failed as well. Will Dr. Merchant succeed in 2127? -----Scores-----Cinematography 7/10 Dark, a bit fuzzy, but mostly OK. I could do without the almost mono-colour palettes.Sound 5/10 Music composed by Daniel Licht, the credits say. Sound overall was not that effective.Acting 3/10 Bruce Ramsay was the lead, I suppose. Unfortunately, his acting was beneath poor. Doug Bradley and Mickey Cottrelle were reasonably good, but the bit players were terrible. Valentina Vargas was marginal.Screenplay 2/10 So we have artificial gravity in 2127? Sounds great. The jumps are many and not helpful among the 18th, 20th, and 22nd centuries. Changing directors in mid-stream due to the interference of the producers did not help. There might have been a coherent idea here at one time. The final product was way too muddled with threads that go nowhere.SFX 4/10 There were lots of CGI (computer generated images), but few of them were well done. The film had plenty of blood and ripped flesh for the gore hounds. The worst FX was the stupid lipstick on John and Paul Merchant. "},{"Title":"Geez, these people need to stay away from that box! Grab a friggin' Rubic's Cube!","Date":"17 March 2012","Score":"","Genre":"Horror, Sci-Fi","Review":" When we think about what famous horror films like A Nightmare on Elm Street, Halloween and Friday the 13th, what do they have in common? They all have a million sequels. The series that seems to be the underdog that most people forget about but know it's main villain is Hellraiser which has a decent amount of sequels. However the sad part is, after the first three movies, every sequel that came out was a direct to video so I don't think the series had much of a chance to stand up to the big boys on the block of the horror genre. Hellraiser was the series that was not only darker but more serious when it came to horror and wasn't afraid to show off the gory side of torture. Think about it, I don't think we could have films like Saw and Hostel which owe a little thanks to Hellraiser for giving us the blood and guts. Also it gave us an extremely dark villain, Pinhead who feels no mercy and enjoys the pleasure of putting pain into your body and pulling your flesh every way possible with chains and hooks. But where did the puzzle box come from? Well Bloodline takes us into the story of the origin of the cenobites.In the year 2127, Paul Merchant, has a robot solve the puzzle box that holds Pinhead. However, several guards led by Rimmer capture Paul. Paul tells Rimmer the story of his bloodline. Philip L'Merchant, a French toymaker, makes the puzzle box for a wealthy aristocrat, who is obsessed with dark magic. He and his apprentice kill a woman and use her to summon the Cenobite slave Angelique. However, Angelique betrays and kills the aristocrat. L'Merchant, in the process of inventing a design to destroy the demons, attempts to steal back the box but is discovered. Jacques, Angelique's master, callously informs the toymaker that he and his bloodline are cursed until the end of time because of the box he created, before ordering Angelique to kill him. However, his wife survives and gives birth to his son, thus continuing the bloodline and to the future where Paul is trying to destroy Pinhead and Angelique once and for all.So I really did enjoy the story of Bloodline, it was a great idea that deserved more time and money. The film does well with what it was given, but since you can tell they were not given such great finances, the film falls short in the acting and shortness of the film. It feels like a made for TV film at times that was just more bloody than others. I couldn't really get into Valentina Vargas as Angelique nor did I find her incredibly evil like Pinhead, she didn't send any chills down my spine. But the last fight with Pinhead was cool and there are some great one liners. Pinhead screaming how he couldn't die is classic considering how many more sequels there are, but this was meant to take place in the future so who knows? Maybe Pinhead really does die in the future. I was a bit disappointed that we didn't have any more Elliot Spencer who is also a very interesting character. But this story was more about how the box was created and the family and their curse to fight the cenobites forever. Over all, it's worth the look, I think this was the last good sequel before it started getting weird and that's odd to say considering this is the Hellraiser series.5/10 "}{"Title":"FINALLY a decent Hellrasier movie.","Date":"25 June 2011","Score":"","Genre":"Horror, Sci-Fi","Review":" In my honest opinion, I think the Hellrasier franchise is extremely overrated in the horror genre. I didn't like Hellraiser 1 at all. I thought it was poorly acted and directed. Hellrasier 2 was an OK movie but certainly not a classic at all. Hellrasier 3 was just awful and ridiculous. So I decided to watch 'Bloodline' last night expecting to see another poor Hellrasier movie. I was completely surprised. It was actually a good movie! Unlike the other Hellrasier movies, 'Bloodline' focuses more on important story elements but it certainly doesn't shy away from the nasty death scenes which have become synonymous with Hellrasier. People will either hate the direction this film takes or will enjoy it. I personally enjoy it and think it's superior to the other Hellrasier films. That probably sounds stupid as Hellraiser 1 & 2 are often touted as horror classics - I've never understood why they get so much praise as classics, whatever...'Bloodline' has both story and gore - the perfect combination for a horror flick in my opinion. People who found Hellrasier 1,2 and 3 lame might just find 'Bloodline' a decent horror movie. Watch it.

It was okay for what it was and though it had an interesting concept &#x96; past, present and future, with each storyline (or is that Bloodline?) having its own beginning, middle and end &#x96; it just really didn't fit the Hellraiser lore, so far.Besides, who could get past the PINHEAD&#x85;IN&#x85;SPACE! (said in best PIGS&#x85;IN&#x85;SPACE! voice-over) main selling point? Sure, this preceded the soon to be, laugh out loud trend of putting slashers in outer space Jason Voorhees in Jason X and Leprechaun in Space. (Did I miss any? No, Critters already came from there.)There's more, though not much, to it. Apparently, there's this Toymaker in France, L'Merchant (Ramsay in three Merchant ancestor roles) who made this box &#x96; what's that box's name anyways? Oh! I just now looked it up after having revisited the first four Hellraiser movies The Lament Configuration, if Wikipedia's telling the truth &#x96; in the 1700s that inadvertently was used to summon a demon. L'Merchant's concerned because, well, that's not the purpose of the puzzle box, but nonetheless, the story begins.Fast forward to present day 1996 (also) France and the demon, Angelique (Vargas &#x96; who has screen presence, so probably just did this for the paycheck) breaks free from her master Jacques (Scott) and goes after the bloodline within (now) John Merchant in the USA. John's trying to decipher the antibody, or cure, or drawling of grandpappy L'Merchant in order to contain light to the demon's (Cenobites) darkness.Here's the one thing I believe I liked most in this ho-hum movie. This second story or present day, represents where Part III left off a high-rise tower in the shape(s) of The Lament Configuration. In addition, it was interesting that this mid-section was as if it were a movie all its own, much like if Creepshow's multi-segments were connected, other than the comic-book narrator.Well, the heroes, or John and his family, are able to thwart Pinhead, who shows up to meet both an heir of The Lament Configuration's Toymaker and the demon Angelique for the first time. Pinhead brings his dog, awww and makes new friends out of twins. Let me stop there; in a movie that's only 86 minutes, not only did most of the movie feel like it dragged on, but when they introduced twin guards into the fray, it seemed not only irrelevant, but just a space-filler.But, I digress, fast forward to the future, on a space station where the last of the Merchants is telling the story to his arresting officer &#x96; apparently he went rogue! &#x96; in order for him to complete the giant light box to kill Pinhead&#x85;once&#x85;and&#x85;for&#x85;all! As expected, it gets cheesy in the closing and falls under the typical bad FX with typical one-two-three killings until, you guessed it. Our (well, new, sorta) heroes confront the (by-this-point overly) preachy Pinhead. Rules bygone, reality and fantasy mix unevenly and we may have the end to the downward spiral of a series Hellraiser has become.This is a SKIP. For any fan of Hellraiser, this is an abomination, irrelevant and almost completely suspenseless &#x96; even III had some level of frights. It's not the absolute worst I've seen in any horror part IV, or even one that takes a horror icon into space, but again, it's a back-story of the box that's really not that interesting or relevant. "},{"Title":"Pinhead Suffers Another Scratch in His Creepiness, This Time Caused By 'Alan Smithee'.","Date":"30 July 2009","Score":"","Genre":"Horror, Sci-Fi","Review":" ***SPOILERS!*** I sometimes wonder what makes sequel-makers think that they have to explain (and therefore destroy) the mysteries behind iconic Horror films. The original Hellraiser of 1987 was an absolute masterpiece and probably one of the scariest films ever made. The 1988 sequel Hellbound was also a fantastic Horror film, though I personally didn't like how the viewer got background information on the Cenobites, some of the all-time creepiest Horror-villains in the original. The third part, Hell on Earth (1992) was already quite a mess, whose makers obviously thought it necessary to add a dose of humor to the formerly incomparably creepy lead-cenobite Pinhead (a typical 90s stupidity) and therefore destroyed most of his scariness. This fourth part Hellraiser Bloodline (1996) is slightly more atmospheric than the third one, but it lowers this quality by inventing even more silly and completely unnecessary 'background information' about the cenobites and the opening of the gates to hell.Seriously - did we need to know how the mysterious puzzle boxes that open the gates to hell are being made? I think not, and that is not the only mystery about the cenobites that is stupidly destroyed in this film. The setting of Bloodline goes back and forth in three different periods. The film begins in a 22nd century space-station, when scientist Dr. Merchant (Bruce Ramsay) attempts to close the gates to hell forever. When government soldiers disrupt his mission he has to explain his reasons. In 18th century Paris, Merchant's ancestor was a toymaker assigned to build a puzzle box by an aristocrat obsessed with the occult. An evoked demon, the princess of hell, took over the body of the beautiful Angelique (Valentina Vargas). Since the only person capable of destroying the gateway to hell is the one who built it, the bloodline of the toymaker would be cursed and his ancestors infested by cenobites throughout the ages... The film, which takes place in the 18th century, the present, and the 22nd century, really is quite a mess. I admit that the part set in the 18th century has a creepy atmosphere and is by far the best part of the film, but its also its smallest part. The parts set in the present and in the future are quite weak, and filled with stupid and unworthy elements. The film's undoubtedly strong points are the terrific make-up and gore-effects, the absolutely ravishing Valentina Varagas as the she-demon, and Pinhead (Doug Bradley), who, in spite of having lost some of his creepiness, still is a menacing villain. It is an almost offensive idea for Hellraiser fans, however, that Pinhead is supposed be defeated by a ridiculous light-show. Overall, Bloodline is not a complete disaster, but it sure is an unworthy sequel to a series that began so brilliantly. Even director Kevin Yagher was obviously embarrassed about it, as he preferred to be credited as Alan Smithee. Overall, this is only recommendable to hardcore Pinhead-fanatics, and most of them are probably going to be angered by another diminution of their favorite demon's creepiness. All others are well-advised to stick with the brilliant first, and excellent second part of the Hellraiser franchise and skip all the others. The makeup effects in Bloodline are creepy as hell, but almost everything else is disappointing.

And you know a movie is in really big trouble when it's been directed by none-other than Alan Smithee, the pseudonym coined for directors disowning their films. But despite all it's got going against it, Hellraiser Bloodline is a surprisingly well-made and entertaining entry in the Hellraiser saga. Not without huge flaws, Bloodline would be the last Hellraiser flick to make it to theaters, followed by a cluster of direct-to-video releases that, sadly, are much worse. The director of the film, it turns out, is Kevin Yagher, the go-to guy for creature effects on such franchises as Child's Play and A Nightmare On Elm Street. It seems he was at odds with Dimension (the studio that produced the film) and when they decided to go behind his back and re-shoot some stuff with director Joe Chapelle (Halloween The Curse Of Michael Myers) in tow, he walking away, burdening this film with the Smithee trademark.Truth be told, there's an interesting story beneath all the issues this film has, mainly a back-story that tells the creation of the puzzle box, and the war raging between Hell and the bloodline of the creator of the puzzle that spans from the 18th century to modern day (well, 1996, mind you) and all the way to the final frontier of space. Bloodline manages to engage and entertain with its tale, especially in the 18th century and modern day bits. These bits (really, 80% of the movie) are the meat (bad word usage considering the film, I suppose) of the film, bookended by the space tale. Aboard a strange spacecraft, we watch Pinhead and the cenobites stalk their way through the crew, which feels less like Hellraiser and more like Friday The 13th (Jason X to be exact) but that's forgivable. What really kills this film are the bits where we watch Pinhead plot and scheme and make rambling speeches. What was once meant as a minor and mysterious character has been reduced to a Freddy Krueger-type (thanks goes to Hellrasier III Hell On Earth) and nearly every time he shows up on screen and opens his mouth, the narrative comes to a screeching halt. On the upside, however, the rest of the story is fairly faithful to the source material. The back-story that opens the film is about as mean and gruesome as Hellraiser can get, and the modern day piece might have made an okay sequel in its own right. The film also looks good, which will come as a bit of shock considering Yagher's lack of experience in directing. The Joe Chapelle scenes, while directed well, stick out like a sore thumb and are a serious detriment to an otherwise solid sequel.All in all, for a film that was directed by Alan Smithee, Hellraiser Bloodline is a worthy affair. Fans of the first two films will feel a rush of relief that most of the corniness at play in Hellraiser III has been abandoned (no CD throwing here!) and that, for the most part, this flick remains true to its roots. For all it's got going against it, it's overall entertaining and certainly more respectable than certain other entries in the series.

In fact, it was on cable tonight and I am sitting here watching it thinking, wow this movie is pretty brutal even compared to the horror/torture genre of movies that have been coming out the past couple of years. Almost every scene is a bloodbath and I really love the Angelique character. Vartina Vargas played her great. It is a very mean spirited movie and for the most part, left out the cheese which is in the third movie.However, it is obvious that the studio interfered and screwed things up. It could have been a lot better. It is a textbook example of why Hollywood is a joke because everything is about the almighty dollar. Like someone else said, it suffered from a low budget too. It was almost as though they spent the budget on the Space Station sets and then ran out of money for everything else.For someone who hasn't seen it, I would recommend it because it does have it's good points. Just don't expect another Hellraiser or Hellraiser 2 but at least it does try to explain the Hellraiser myth and is really the last true Hellraiser movie because from Inferno on, the series breaks off into an entire different tangent.

Also, the movie would have been fine without the idiot from the future telling his story in a flashback. It could have just been the modern day John Merchant finding out about his bloodline, instead of Pinhead-in-ancient-France and Pinhead in Space in the same movie. The only reason this movie earned a 5/10 was the fact that Pinhead himself saved the movie from total cinematic crap...he's just too cool (even though he took backstage to a useless villain again like in Hellbound.)

While there appears to have been quite a few arguments between the director (Kevin Yagher) and the producers, this comes together fairly well if somewhat chaotic at times, but this should probably not be appointed to any failings on Yagher's abilities but rather on the producers lacking understanding of Yagher's ideas. As an sequel, well it stands out due to the fact that it dosn't revolve much around Pinhead or somebody that comes into contact with the Puzzle Box but more on the story and creation of the Puzzle Box itself. And this is in my opinion a nice twist to the franchise and a welcomed one at that (I Can't help it but I'm a sucker for background/story on anything up this alley).The effects is good enough while not being spectacular, they do what they are supposed to and nothing more. The acting is not Oscar worthy or anything close to but works good enough. Doug Bradley is as always when portraying Pinhead splendid although he dosn't do that much here, is more in the background than taking any significant part. Bruce Ramsay does a lot of character jumping in this one and while he acts the roles of Phillip L'Merchant/John Merchant/Paul Merchant with nicely enough passion it comes up somewhat lacking, you just don't feel that much for the different Merchants that you should considering that the Family is the creators of the Lament Configuration. Valentina Vargas is good as Angelique; the princess of Pinhead's Hell; She plays her as a uncaring bitch, as the character should be played. Christine Harnos does a good job playing Rimmer; a soldier interrogating Paul Merchant and being very confused and not quite able to get to grips with what he's saying (I guess pretty much anybody would have trouble doing just that.).All in all I think this is a good addition to the franchise and I give it 7 out of 10.

An armed recovery crew interrupts him, and this is where the background for the movie, and ultimately the series begins.Christine Harnos as Rimmer (anyone know if this is a Red Dwarf reference?), proceeds to interrogate Merchant. We are told the story as a lengthy flashback. It's revealed why and how the puzzle box came to be. As the flashback continues it's learned how the bloodline is important, pertaining to the original maker and how his bloodline was cursed for creating the puzzle box. Doug Bradley as Pinhead, of course makes a triumphant return, but no other Cenobites from previous films do. The film also introduces I believe a new character, Valentina Vargas as Angelique, a demon who was summoned by the original petitioner of the puzzle box.There's a lot to be enjoyed in this movie. There's the classic Hellraiser moments and effects. The acting is good, and Bradley has never been better as Pinhead. Valentina Vargas portrays her demon character very well too. The story is written well, and really covers a lot of ground in this average length film.Fans of Hellraiser really should appreciate this movie as part of the series.

The initial atmosphere and setting by Clive Barker has completely vanished, yet the morbid surrounding remains and several sequences are still very creepy and unsettling.

Pinhead &#150; accompanied by a pet puppy this time &#150; still knows how to kill&#133;too bad he talks too much and his vicious speeches tend to get boring quickly. Best aspects in this production are the newly introduced 'cenobites' and the occult Parisian portrait. Giant turn-offs are the weak script, the absence of the typical macabre humor and the lack of references to Barker's initial masterpiece.Although not highly memorable itself, Bloodline stands as the last watchable Hellraiser film. After this sequel, the series went downhill completely. So far, 2 more sequels came out (2 more are still in process) and neither of those is worth seeing.

While Bloodline has a number of problems, the most prominent being the slowly-paced first hour of the film, there's a lot to like here too. For one, the creature and make-up effects look great (I loved the canine-like Cenobite), there's lots of gore, decent enough acting (though the twin security guards were easily the worst two actors ever to grace the screen) and a lush musical score by Daniel Licht. This was the directional debut of effects artist Kevin Yagher, who later had creative differences with the producers and left the project before finishing some scenes, and rather than attaching his own name to the film went with the much-abused alias Alan Smithee. Additional scenes were shot by Joe Chappelle, who later went on to direct the excellent 1998 Dean Koontz adaptation, Phantoms. Yagher has yet to direct another film.Not nearly as bad as you'd expect a fourth entry in a horror franchise to be, Hellraiser Bloodline is worth checking out if you're a horror fan.

But the first two were at least extravagent in the artistic department, and in the third one it was cool to see the new cenobites. This one has nothing good to offer. It seems like the makers of the film took two movies and spliced them together- creating a mess of a movie that could've been an epic 3 hours long, but thankfully they've reduced it to a monotonous hour and a half of garbage. Nothing's really new in this one, except -oh yeah- they've added an entire new plotline (No more Kristy or old pinhead, the toymaker's now the main focus) that you can never really acept or get a hold on because the movie moves too quickly, from one dull pointless grusome scene to the next.

Is the director's vision better? I have my doubts.This is basically three separate hour long movies truncated and crammed into one 90 minute or so feature. Maybe this would work as a 3 hour movie, or 2 or 3 separate movies, or maybe even a miniseries, but one 90 minute film? No. It tries to bookend the Hellraiser franchise in 90 minutes--think about this, 90 minutes is going to explain the origin and finale of the Hellraiser Trilogy that came before it with a little mid-plot thrown in between for good measure. You can't bookend another film (much less a franchise) in 90 minutes.Like all bad horror sequels, this tries to explain and (even worse) cap off the series. Yeah, right. I don't think so. Then again, this came along during the kill all the slasher villains phase in the 90s, starting with Freddy, going to Jason, now this. Even worse, (yes, it gets worse) this combines the In Space concept behind many horror films now. Nowhere else to go? Take it to space! Where no man has gone before! Cue Star Trek theme. We get three timelines, and not one is handled with any particular interest. The first flashback is the most interesting of the three, so the film feels like it put some bait out front to lure you into watching the rest of its dull unenthused running time. New characters (some of whom played by the same actors in the new time) pop up in the new timelines, but I never really had anything to invest in the previous characters so scrwe the new ones.This disjointed nature destroys the film. There's nothing with 'flashback' nature films, there's nothing wrong with 'space' films if they're handled right. Space films not handled right turn out hokey, and if you cannot handle linear storytelling, flashbacks will not magically enhance your ability as a storyteller. It's not automiatically 'sophisticated' or 'elegant'; it takes talent and knowledge to know when to use it. This film was lacking one or both, and it's hokey.In the end, it's a hacked together jumble of ideas which do not work together as a solid story should; it violates the crime most sequels commit in trying to cap the series AND tries to explain, explain, explain--we do not need any more explanations in horror sequels! You can't have a mystery stay a mystery if it's explained, and you can't be scared knowing all the facts. The original hellraiser had its shimmer because no one knew anything about the box other than you probably don't want to open it, and your guess was as good as mine as to where Pinhead came from.Hellraiser II managed to pull off a nice explanation about Pinhead, but you'll also note they introduce a bigger, badder cenobyte to haunt hell and discard Pinhead because he's been explained and is no longer scary. Granted the new cenobyte does not pose as big a mystery as Pinhead, but I haven't seen very many other films that manages to explain anything coherently and maintain its atmosphere reasonably well. Enough about Hellbound, back to Bloodline There is no mystery. Everything is out in the open--all the ideas are under bright florescent lights where no shadows can hide anything. Say bye bye to scary, there's nothing left to explain in the Hellraiser world, which also means there's nothing left there to scare us.Given the reasons above, I cannot possibly see how the original director could have done much better with the material I've seen. I don't see how the Explain everything about Hellraiser in a series of brief meaningless flashbacks while capping the series in space could possibly work. That combination of bad ideas would require one hell of a craftsman to suspend my disbelief and make me say Whoa with the concepts behind this film.Having said that, I still wouldn't hesitate to watch Yagher's rendition, but at the same time I highly doubt he's talented enough to make this disaster work. Nothing against Yagher, I can't think of *any* director that could make this disaster work. May Yagher prove me wrong some day, and I'd welcome that . . . but I can't imagine this crap being good.

The film is set in the future and in a space craft where a man tries to eliminate Pinhead for ever. The plot is pretty confusing and many characters are there but it's not too hard to follow.The film is not a masterpiece but couple of scenes are pretty creepy and well crafted and the gore effects are plenty, too. *minor spoiler* The transformation of the brothers is very convincing and horrifying as they become one of the most interesting cenobites in the whole Hellraiser saga. *no spoilers* So it is not as bad as some people have said, but maybe they have seen only the censored version which is available at least here in Finland.

In fact, it will leave most feeling pretty disgusted. Whether it was the buckets of blood, creepy crawlies on dead flesh, gore, decapitations, and ripped skin, Hellraiser films always turned heads. The movie in question here is Hellraiser 2, arguably the most gruesome film ever recorded.Well, after seeing this, a more daring, productive sequel, I have to say it's even more disturbing then the first sequel. The fourth film is set in 2147 on a spaceship, and Pinhead decides to wreak havoc on a bunch on under-paid actors, resulting in buckets of blood and gore. The film ventures into the past of the evil Rubiks cube, where it came from, and how it evolved. But this time the results are even more morbid.The acting is of amateur standard. The special effects are low budget and look cheap. The storyline is a little flaky, and the setting on a spaceship started to make it feel like Babylon-X. But one thing they did get right. Before some of the Hellraiser scenes were unintentionally hilarious. Everyone remembers the CD death from Hell On Earth, and the most ridiculous romance storyline in horror history in Hellbound. But this time the scenes are exceptionally cruel, brutal, and so severe only a mental case would find them amusing. The deaths are even more fantastic (meaning of fantasy, not enjoyable in the slightest). They really have hit the nail on the head (if you excuse the pun, Pinhead). This was the idea, but I certainly don't think your typical audience enjoy this sort of defilement. For example, here a helpless cop gets his head twisted into a deformed cenobite, so they become two. Later on, a more disturbing death occurs when the cenobite couple stand on either side of another victim, and all three heads twist together in hideousness. It certainly creates an evil atmosphere, and I award this the category of Most Depressing Film.The direction of this film is all over the place. Some would argue that there's too much talking and not enough action. I also share this view. They didn't space the action out enough. The first two-thirds of the film are a complete mess, going through the history of the box, with the odd death. After seeing this, I say I'd rather keep it a mystery. The last third is an all-action, blood-coated climax. Not to mention disturbing.Hellraiser Bloodline is not a good film. It is strictly average. It seems clumsily put together, like the way a four-year-old child inserts stickers into his Pokemon album.

Unlike Bloodline, the first Hellraiser film was a respectable foray for Barker and the first real success at putting his dark visions onto celluloid, as was the more 'out there' sequel, while 'Hellraiser III' wanted to commercialise the series and seemingly slot old Pinhead beside Freddy Krueger and Jason from the 'Friday the 13th' movies.This the fourth in the series catapults Pinhead out into the stars to a space station while shifting the story back in time to the origin of the infamous puzzle box and the female cenobite it summons, and it is here where the film flounders the most. Though the story provides answers to a lot of questions asked before, the epic timeline sacrifices characterisation, and a horror movie without characters you care about is just a day out at the abattoir.Pinhead has surprisingly little to do in the movie despite Doug Bradley's usual steadfast portrayal. And it's puzzling why the female cenobite is allowed to steal so much airtime, apart from possibly injecting more sex into the script. The cenobites in space theme also seems misplaced and results in an uncomfortable mix of sci-fi and horror that never really gels like it did in 'Alien' or to a lesser extent 'Event Horizon', which this film has a lot in common with.Kevin Yagher's directorial debut is acceptably workmanlike, though his use of the Alan Smithee pseudonym can only indicate his disappointment with the final production, maybe even as much as I was at having to watch ANOTHER group of victims run around ANOTHER techno-junk filled corridor out in space.

This time around, the Hollywood process generated this film by fusing together concepts and input from various screenwriters, directors and studio executives.  Not the combination that usually results in a cult-horror film.  And Hellraiser Bloodline doesn't exactly deliver a cult-horror film; instead it delivers an interesting, reasonably complex film that works best if seen as a stand-alone story, rather than a popular horror film sequel.This fourth movie focuses less on the sadism elements of the original films, and plays around with ultimately more interesting ideas... such as 'technology vs. myth/spiritualism' (a conflict that is decidedly resolved in the satisfying finale) and the possibility of redemption for pure evil (the demoness Angelique, played nicely by actress Valentia Vargas).The storyline itself is quite strong, paced like an epic saga of the traditional good against evil conflict played out against the backdrop of human history.  The sheer ambition and scope of this sequel far outweighs the simple blood-letting of the original films.  Acting performances are pretty decent all around.Naturally, die-hard fans of the original movies will be shocked that their favorite evil icons are placed into such a decidedly non-Hellraiser movie, but they can take comfort in the fact that they can just go back to watching the originals on videotape if that's what they prefer.  However, viewers who appreciate dark stories with an edge, should enjoy Hellraiser Bloodline's fusion of the horror and science fiction genres into a grand period piece. Fans of the film 'Event Horizon' should definitely check this out, as the tone is quite similar.Depending on your mood, there is plenty of opportunity to view this as a comedy too, due to the over-the-top nature of many of the set pieces (actually the fact that Pinhead has one-liners in this film should tell you not to take the whole thing too seriously).  It may ultimately be a flawed film, but it has plenty to offer and tries hard to entertain.Even though the original director removed his name from this film because it wasn't what he originally envisioned, the fact remains that the final product is quite unique and highly watchable.

When things start we join an apparent madman (played by Bruce Ramsay) on a spaceship as he tries to open a certain troublesome puzzle box and end a nightmare that has plagues his family through centuries. We find this out as Ramsay relates the tales of his family history (all featuring a male predecessor played by Ramsay) and reveals some more about the grand plan of the cenobites.Sound okay so far? Well, you will also be pleased to hear that there are some enjoyably unpleasant moments here, complete with decent special effects, and one particularly impressive new cenobite design worth looking out for.The movie assumes knowledge on the part of the viewer, which is fair enough considering it's the fourth instalment, but also seems to ignore a lot of the events from the first three films (especially in regards to Pinhead).Then there's the acting which is pretty terrible from almost everyone. Ramsay has three roles and is awful in all of them, Valentina Vargas is supposed to be sexy and evil but doesn't have the talent to convince as either (which is a great shame as she has a large part in the movie), Adam Scott has a small role that I'm sure he doesn't bring up in party conversations and Kim Myers . . . . . well, she actually does a lot better here than she did in Freddy's Revenge. Thankfully, Doug Bradley is as excellent as ever in his Pinhead incarnation and his scenes bring the movie back up to an acceptable level.It's a shame to read up on the background of the movie and to consider what WASN'T filmed but many movies are compromised and changed from their inception - this is a step up from many other Alan Smithee movies, as damning faint praise as that is.

The editing is bad, the photography is bad, actors don't really know what they are doing. I'd rather say they didn't know what they were doing from the very beginning.

It's hard to say what hurt the film worse - the obviously limited budget, the casting, the cuts made by the studio (which lead the director to take his name off the film) or the lack of inspiration in the screenplay.The movie does some things well. Pinhead is a striking character design, and Doug Bradley plays the part to the hilt. Pinhead gets to spend lots of time declaiming his philosophy of, well, I hate to call it life...let's just call it his philosophy. Vargas is a major babe; in this movie she absolutely oozes danger and sexuality, and since she is a relative unknown, the viewer doesn't have the problems with cognitive dissonance that a better known actress would cause. The production, art and sound design folks did an impressive job of getting as much atmosphere and mood out of the money and time available as was humanly possible.But the whole thing just falls short. I have to blame the male lead, Bruce Ramsey for some of this - the movie stands or falls on how well his character is written and how convincingly he pulls it off, and he just can't carry the movie, at least not with the character as written. Imagine a low-energy Tim Curry, only not as interesting or magnetic or funny. I am sure he is a fine actor, and I wouldn't hesitate to watch him in another major role, but he is 2nd rate goods here.And the writing and dialog is weak in some spots, and very weak and sluggish in too many other spots...even Pinhead gets to be a bit of a blow-hard in some spots. For a movie about families and history, IV just feels like it takes place in a social vacuum, on a sound stage instead of in the world.A lot of people have commented unfavorably about the movie resorting to the idea of Pinhead In Space, and it's possible that the movie would have been better if so much of its budget wasn't spent on space station CGI. But it works here, and adds a nice contrasting visual theme to the film, and I figure it was worth a try. Pinhead is Pinhead, after all, no matter what context you put him in.Cable TV has been putting Bloodlines in fairly heavy rotation recently for some reason, and I have caught bits and pieces of it here and there. In fairness to the people who put this movie together, I have to admit that once you know where the 'good bits' are, the movie holds up well to repeated viewings...you can sit through some of the draggy or weak bits because you know that the good part with the hooks is coming right up. They have also been showing a later direct-to-video chapter called Hellseeker which is more of a Twilight Zone puzzler, and far less shocking than even this lesser effort....so count your blessings, Pinhead fans, and enjoy what there is to enjoy here. Bloodlines was probably the last real Hellraiser film.

Much like the third installment, the fourth entry's only obvious connection to the original story is the useage of the Puzzlebox and Pinhead.Unlike the other entries in this series that identified Pinhead's true identity and his self-destruction as a human being, this story tries to examine the origins of the Puzzlebox. The story kicks off back in the days of the French revolution and Marie Antoinette. A French toymaker (Bruce Ramsay) has constructed a 'puzzlebox' for a wealthy mad man who has intentions of using it to open up the portal to Hell. He has invited a French whore to his house of which he uses as a vessel to be occupied by Satan once he murders her by strangulation and skins her. When Ramsay delivers the puzzlebox to the mad man, he witnesses a vortex opening in the floor as incantations are spoken. The whore's flesh hangs via several hooks over the vortex and is 'filled' once the incantantions have stopped. She becomes 'Angelique', a woman with the face of beauty and the heart of a demon. Ramsay doesn't get far once he witnesses all of this horror. He is ultimately murdered but his legacy is continued through the birth of his son.We follow Ramsay through several generations (the same man playing the same character) as he meets Angelique and dies an untimely death each time. It almost comes off like 'Groundhog Day' where the scenario keeps repeating itself, but each time, his son survives and we get to the point where it is now several hundreds of years later and the setting is now aboard a space craft. Through all of this ridiculous hack storytelling, there is one good scene where two twins are turned into cenobites by Pinhead, but unfortunately, that was not enough to save this turkey.Basically, Pinhead and Angelique stalk the corridors of the space craft as they kill off members of the police force one by one in amusing ways. One man gets sliced in a mirror. Another man has hooks rip off the flesh of his face while a drill protrudes through the top of his cranium. There is even a cenobite dog that attacks a man! AND through all of this, Ramsey's character has devised a plan to create a puzzlebox via laserbeams projected through sattelites that will send Pinhead and Angelique back to Hell once and for all. I have no idea who wrote this story, but I can guarantee he/she won't be working in Hollywood again.This really shouldn't have been labelled as the 'fourth' entry in the Hellraiser series as nothing about it was releated to the main storyline or even had anything to do with what 'Hellraiser' is all about. The thing I've always liked the most about Pinhead are his black pupils and his yellow teeth. The poster for this movie portrayed him as having a green head with shining red eyes! That alone should tell you that this is an imposter in the franchise.I realise that this came out before the (hopefully final) fifth entry in the series and that movie was worse than this one.

They only pull Smithee out of the woodwork when they really think they've made a terrible movie, such as classics as The Birds II Land's End or Bloodsucking Pharaohs in Pittsburgh. No I didn't make that up. How did I like it? You're reading this so I'm sure that's what you want to know.The Good This movie isn't as bad as you've been led to believe. Oh I'm not going to sugar-coat it. This movie was filled with so much potential and ended up being a disaster, but it does have some positives. Cooler cenobites this time around for starters, such as the twins and the demon Angelique. Pinhead is still in a main role, and still has good lines(Pain has a face, allow me to show it to you) and it's somewhat entertaining throughout. Gorehounds will love the movie because of it's endless supply. There is also some continuity with the rest of the series, although you'll have to look hard to see it. The Chatterer Dog is awesome.The Bad But for a story about Hell vs the cursed Merchant bloodline that could close the gateway forever, it was really complicated and held together with duct tape. Nothing was really explored to it's full potential and there were some really stupid things included. Pinhead kidnaps a kid and holds him for ransom! Random deaths just to feature more blood(not always a bad thing, but not for the sake of the story). Pinhead is at his worst here, he rants and rants and rants even when he's about to die! For the very smart demon that he used to be, he's been reduced to nothing more than a Bond villain, at best. If Hellraiser fans ever needed a reason why he was moved back into a cameo like role, this is it. Bloodline ruined it for us all.The Ugly Gore is always mentioned here. This one has skin ripping, drilling, hook impaling, beheadings, and more goodies. The Chatterer Dog, while awesome, reeks of bad special effects during the chase scenes.Final Verdict This movie had the potential for something great, even Hellbound levels of greatness. But all of that was wasted. Who knows exactly what went down to produce this crap, but we can only blame Alan Smithee.Compared to the rest This movie is the worst of the Hellraiser series.

Yeah, the entire movie was basically an extended flashback so that the writer could justify the space setting, and then that stuff was lame too (it was basically a slasher movie... but we'd spent maybe 20 minutes here top. So we didn't know anyone's name and it's faceless people being killed slasher-movie style + 2 underdeveloped leads. One of whom just exists so the guy has someone to tell the back story too)And that's not even close to giving justice to how horrible this was. The characters? They exist for no reason other than to drive the plot forward (or die gory deaths after one scene) There's underdeveloped, and then there's these utter non-entities with such little effort put into characterizing them that you feel like your watching a living, breathing, speaking prop. Every single one was a plot device to move the plot forward, much like the plot was basically just an extended back story to bring Pinhead to space. See a pattern here?And the best part is that they couldn't even do the back story (which is a good 80-90% of the movie) properly. There's more holes in this movie's plot than there are in Swiss cheese. How is Jaques still alive 200 years later? How is the body Angelique is possessing still functioning 200 years later? How could Phillip have any descendants when the film never hinted at a child? What exactly were Jaques and Angelique doing for those 200 years while she knew Phillip's descendants were running around? If she wanted that line wiped out, you'd think she'd try to do that as fast as possible. And how does Angelique know Pinhead? She left hell before he got there! I'm sure there's more that I forgot, but nothing about this movie's plot holds up under even the most basic analysis of its events.As far as its relation to the series goes, I'm kinda surprised this one was meant to be a Hellraiser film.

It seems to mostly focus on the female demon Angelique, who is actually quite forgettable. Doug Bradley nails it again as Pinhead.

The plotline has its possibilities, telling the tale of Pinhead and his cynobites and the magic box as they move through the ages, from Medieval times and through the Romantic and Restoration periods, the twentieth century, and into the future (where the film beings on a chintzy-computer animated spaceship).But, the film doesn't live up to its imaginative promise, proving to be thick in stupidity, delivering stiff performances, cheap special effects and costumes, and one of the worst scenes of a character wandering around in the dark (I know that some security gaurds are not so bright, but cmon!

God, this movie is bad ! This is a shame, because the second and third Hellraisers were fairly smart, imaginative little gothic-gore horror tales that I thought were about the best scary movies of the 1980s and 90s.

And this movie begs the question was the director's vision of this film going to be better than the version that the studio released (after changing it against Yagher's wishes)?  Who can say for sure.  One thing is very clear when watching this movie the premise is very interesting and alone it demands a better treatment.  I'll analyse what I think is going on with this movie.We have to skip the futuristic introduction; it looks nice but is confused.  We don't know enough about the why, and only some of it is revealed at the end of the film, this despite the story being told from the POV of the future protagonist.  This leaves us with two choices either ignore the introduction or fill in the narrative ourselves (the latter leads to disappointment later on as our imagination is clearly better).  Either way, we forget what we see and optimistically we find ourselves in Renaissance France.Act I France, opens well and sets a tone of spookiness that captures the suspense aficionado.  The footage is quite beautiful, if macabre, and is in line with what we would expect to see.  Clearly though, something has been excised from this Act of the film because the relationships between the characters change without warning towards the end the entailments from what we are told previously do not coincide with where the Act leads (which just gives us loose ends, or unresolved plot-lines).  It is jarring for the viewer, not so much because of the material, which is jarring to say the least, but as it seems a little rushed (which adds to the sense that something is missing).  That much could be forgiven if the film settles into a pace that can be followed without too much trouble, but this is where HellRaiser Bloodline collapses and never recovers.  Act 2 New York.  This is a mixed up cutover from Act I the sudden end of a relationship which sees the initial antagonist, Angelique, heading to New York to locate the toymaker, who has meanwhile constructed a building that acts as a big containment device for Cenobites (in a manner not unlike the Lament Configuration it seems).  Bizarrely, there is no reference to the building or to its strange setup until we are *in it*, following some erstwhile security guards to their timely ends.  But then there is something about a kid as bait, and a wife trying to save herself from a Cenobite dog (werewolf?).  And Angelique is suddenly forced into becoming a Cenobite.  Is that what is happening?  Obviously on this detail I am lost.  She comes across as a Julia-like character in Act I and for most of Act II but is then inexplicably confronted by Pinhead and seems to turn into a Cenobite herself... is this usually what happens now in these movies?  Seems at odds with HellRaiser folklore to me.Act III Future Space Station.  This part looks like it was filmed on the Event Horizon or some similar spacecraft and is stylish.  HOWEVER, by this time the chop and slop we are being served doesn't add up.  We don't understand why Dr Merchant is being hounded by the thugs with guns, or worse still, why the hell are those goons so utterly incompetent?  In any suspense/horror setting, it is much more exciting when the guys with guns are intelligent and well-trained, but still no match for the bad guys (ie the Cenobites).. on that point compare with Aliens.The main thing this movie suffers is not even just that the pace is messy, which it is, but that the relationships between the central characters and the various plot devices are totally shattered and mismatched.  Who would put such a shoddy piece of work together?  I think we can all guess that meddling by the studio played a big part in this.  (Cast your thoughts back to Brazil and how much better the Director's vision turned out to be).As far as the HellRaiser franchise is concerned, this movie is a low point, about as bad as it gets (along with the slightly better HellRaiser III Hell on Earth, which I guess is what started the trend towards cluelessness on the part of the production team).  I am all for HellRaiser movies, not necessarily being related to any central or ongoing non-Cenobite characters, but at least give us a consistent and structured story to work with!

The second is essentially the same, though in retrospect, every action, every spoken line of dialogue, is played with tongue so firmly in cheek it reaches the ultimate in high camp.The third is, on second glance, a vaguely-commendable attempt to repackage the film series and introduce it to a wider audience. Unfortunately this involved giving the lead villain, Pinhead, super powers and cracking jokes. Completely inappropriate for such a visceral character, just as his constant eulogies grate in the fourth.And so I came to see Bloodline for a second time, a movie which, initially, I was pleased gave a seriousness back to the characters. Second glance reveals it's absolute tripe of the highest order.A pinhead in space sequel, this one falls between both horror and science fiction genres, though is unlikely to worry aficionados of either. Holograms are involved, and a character called Rimmer stalks the ship (maybe the production team had been watching episodes of Red Dwarf?) The central plot involves Bruce Ramsay as Mr.Merchant, a man who, in his ancestral past, invented the box that started the whole thing off. This idea to fill in the back story must be commended, but then Psycho IV filled in Norman Bates' back story and look at what a lame film that was.This handy device of a line of Merchants (Philip, John and Paul) means that they can all be portrayed by the same actor. The notion of having one actor dress up in silly wigs and put on a French accent in a medieval setting is something that has delighted the makers of Britains' Children's Film Foundation for many a year in the 70s, but this is an adult film of the supposedly-sophisticated 90s. Cheap-looking, we follow these flimsily-written vignettes through to a present time and then to 2127. If your idea of film entertainment is seeing a temptress in ball gown turn her hand into a bright green claw then rip off half of someone's face and prod their cheekbone then this is for you. Personally I found it unnecessarily crude in it's vulgar gore.And so we reach the present timeline of the series, a place where a no longer scary Pinhead feeds scraps to a chattering plastic dog and preaches a load of half-baked nonsense about Hell and damnation, God and religion... all the usual stuff, but even less inspired than usual. This conclusion aboard the ship only lasts for just twenty minutes, indicating that ideas were low on supply for this exceptionally short film.This really is just pulp-schlock-gore, though in fairness this isn't Atkins' worst script for the series, it's just the direction and acting that make it seem worse than it is. Budget, too, seems lacking for what is a high concept for the series, and comes off as a low-grade tv movie. But then, set on a high-tech spaceship, do we really believe Merchant is in any danger from some bloke with a pin cushion for a head? The film even ignores it's own rules, that of a cenobite can only take the lament configuration box if it is freely given. Here Rimmer gets it whipped out of her hand by the Jezebel Cenobite, Angelique. If the writer has such a lack of respect for his own borrowed concept, then how can we respect his screenplay?Clive Barker wrote the script for the enjoyable Hellraiser. The state of decreasing returns were all penned by Peter Atkins, based on the original concept. However, I bet Barker isn't complaining, he sold the rights to the lot for a million.

Basically it is the year 2127 on the Space Station Mionos, and the man who built the station Dr. Paul Merchant (Bruce Ramsay) has built a robot that can solve the Lament Configuration, i.e. the puzzle box, but the robot is destroyed and he is captured, and he tells his kidnapper Rimmer (Christine Harnos) the story of his bloodline. The story flashbacks 400 years earlier, where French toymaker Philip L'Merchant (Ramsay again) creates the Lament Configuration, he believes it will be just a simple puzzle box for wealthy aristocrat Duc De L'Isle (Mickey Cottrell), but he has black magic in mind and uses it to release Cenobite slave Angelique (Valentina Vargas) from the dark regions. The toymaker also invented the Elysium Configuration which he uses to destroy the demons, the Duc's apprentice Jacques (Adam Scott) informs him that his bloodline are cursed until time ends because of his creation. Two hundred year pass, and the next in the bloodline John Merchant (also Ramsay) is the architect who built the building seen at the end of Hellraiser III, where the puzzle box was placed in the wet cement, and after Jacques is killed by Angelique she travels to America and tries to seduce John, the puzzle box is taken from the ground, and a man solves it and as a result releases Pinhead (Doug Bradley). The Cenobite leader wants the Elysium Configuration to be be used to open the gates of Hell and allow him and his dark forces to do anything he pleases, and he knows the best way to force John to do it is by threatening his child Jack (Courtland Mead). The Elysium Configuration is forced to be used, but it does not work, so Merchant is killed, while his wife Bobbi (Kim Myers) is the one who sends Pinhead, Angelique and the other Cenobites created back to Hell. Back in the future 2127 on the space station the Cenobites are freed once again, Rimmer realises the danger they are all in and releases Paul so that he can destroy the demons, using the main purpose the Minos was built for. Pinhead is distracted while Paul and Rimmer escape in a shuttle, and the combination of powerful lasers and mirrors create a blast of light, and the space station is transformed into a giant version of the puzzle box to trap the Cenobites within, and it self destructs as well, and destroying the connection between Hell and Earth as well. Bradley still keeps you watching as Pinhead with his philosophical like dialogue and his malevolent love for torture and death on humans, I will be honest though I don't fully agree with the critics giving it an average review, I think it is nearly the most ridiculous of the films in the series, going to the future and into space is a daft idea, only the origins of the puzzle box and the bloody effects is what kept me interested, apart from that it was a slightly disappointing horror. Okay!

As can be predicted a special force is sent to retake the expensive station and put Merchant into custody. Upon arrival they find him partaking in a weird ritual with the use of a mysterious cubical. During interrogation he reveals that they must let him finish, what he has started or else the hell he has released will bathe in blood... In order to convince the officers holding him captive he reminisces about his heritage, about the toymaker who built the box and about the reasons as to why he is here in space...The movie that is essentially the same to Hellraiser, that The Quickening was to Highlander. Something to be ignored and forgotten, as so it won't influence the lore of Hellraiser to much. By far the most trashy of the franchise with a much more low-grade feel to it than its predecessors (who let's face it were B or C class films).Acting at times seems to be influenced by a mid-budget porn-flick with wooden unbelievable performances, that actually have you thinking So when are they going to undress and start with the intercourse? Surprisingly not much sex in the movie, albeit the introduction of the seductress-demon Angelique (a totally superfluous character that unnecessarily messes with what we know of the world of Hellraiser) offers ample opportunities for the love-making.Basically the movie consists of three abruptly pasted together separate short stories (one in the future, one in the present and one in the past) which lack focus and are rushed along in amateurish fashion. The end result is extremely poor, basically underlined by the fact you have no interest into what happens to any of the characters in the film.Some decent gore in the flick, but apart from that an utter failure.

I believe it's the fourth installment in the Hellraiser series.I missed the beginning, and all I remember from there was some topless women and a box-shape thing on a computer screen. But, using my wit and intelligence, (and the Info Button) I soon found out that the villain (Pinhead) was released from Pandora's Box, which, I believe is a gateway straight to Hell.So, anyways, Pinhead somehow comes out of the box and terrorizes the Toymaker's family. And, that's about it. Oh, and not to mention the random tortures of various people that cross his path. Yawn.What mainly happens in this film is that Pinhead captures the kid, and then unleashes the dog on his wife, and then kills a random person. Then he husband comes along, blah, blah, blah. Who cares? Why it fails is because Hellraiser Bloodline is too corny to be scary. Look at Pinhead's minion of creatures a cheesy dog that looks like it's been turned inside out, two men whose heads and bodies are connected together, (Siamese twins in a horror film?) and some person who is supposed to be a princess of some sort. (I haven't seen the previous films.) Now look at the main villain. His name is Pinhead. Isn't that the name you call somebody when they're stupid? He has pins in his head and hooks coming out of his fingers, and he has blue skin. I suppose he would make a decent villain if he didn't have such a corny name, and a corny speech. Somewhere in the film, two cops approach him and say Don't make us put some pain on you! Pinhead replies Pain? How dare you use that word! I AM pain&#133; blah, blah, blah, blah blah. It sounds a bit cliché if you ask me.Don't forget the final half of the movie. The characters (and audience) get to experience more torture when Pinhead attacks some futuristic asylum. Some person who we don't recognize (Maybe he was in the previous films. I don't remember him in the beginning of the movie.) This scene is basically one thing played over and over again A guard goes to inspect a mysterious noise.Some other guard Oh no! He's down. I will go check on him&#133;by myself!After he dies the same thing happens again.(SPOILERS) Here's the thing I didn't get. In the film Pinhead is supposedly sent to Oblivion at the end. So, how does he come back for another four films? Are they prequels? Why hasn't he died in the previous ones? Geez. The makers need to come up with an idea for a different series. (END OF SPOILERS) Hellraiser Bloodline is gory and full of torture scenes, but has little thrill or scare value. Just forget it. Bad special effects with bad&#133;everything else make this more of a snooze-fest than a good horror.Good Well&#133;some people may enjoy the topless women in the beginning. Plus, Pinhead's voice is pretty cool. I suppose if you like ultra-violence, you might like this too.Bad None of the reasons above make this a very good film. The corniness and repetitiveness are pretty bad. And, who names their villain Pinhead?Feel free to send me a Private Message regarding this comment.

An ambitious idea.  But none of the cast is given enough screen time to do anything with their characters and rookie director Yagher abandoned the film rather than give in to studio meddling.

He opens the Chinese puzzle box which releases Pinhead (Doug Bradley) & his twisted Cenobites & opens the door to hell as he plans to destroy them forever but he is stopped when a team of marines sent to regain control of the station capture him. Merchant pleads with them to let him finish what he has started & tells his interrogator Rimmer (Christine Harnos) the story of the deadly little puzzle box which dates back to 17th Century Paris where his ancestor Phillip L'Merchant (Bruce Ramsay again) built the box for an evil magician named Duc de L'Ise (Mickey Cottrell) who gives it it's power & uses it to open the gates of hell, Merchant then goes on to continue the story through the generations until now where he intends to finally destroy the box & close the gateway to hell forever...Oh dear, this the fourth entry in the Hellraiser franchise had a few behind-the-scenes problems. Originally set to be directed by special effects man Kevin Yagher the producers at Mirimax didn't share his artistic sentiment & they re-cut the film extensively & hired another director Joe Chappelle to re-shoot some of it & turn in the film they wanted, apparently Hellraiser Bloodline was going to be very different then the way it eventually turned out so Kevin Yagher disowned it & the director now on the opening credits is the infamous Alan Smithee. The script is credited to Pete Atkins but who knows exactly how much of it has actually ended up on screen, anyway I can't quite believe that anyone would think that putting Pinhead on a space station over a 100 years in the future would be a good idea. The basic concept is rather neat with a chronological time-line that charts the Chinese puzzle box & it's origins but the finished result is a bit of a mess, the character's are poor, the dialogue that comes from Pinhead's mouth is terrible, it's stupid, it ignores just about everything that made the first two films so brilliant, shooting Pinhead with laser guns at the end looks silly, there is no journey into hell & to add insult to injury they've given Pinhead a pet dog! Having said that I found that it moved along at a nice pace & isn't boring & there's a fair amount of gruesome gore (yeah!) if nothing else, at least it entertained me right through to the end.The film has a certain gloss to it but it lacks the imagination that the first two Hellraiser films showed & it comes across a bit flat & lifeless at times, it definitely doesn't have the dark sadistic edge or atmosphere of the first two. A lot of stuff was changed & re edited, I'm not sure if I should be saying this but if you have a search on Youtube.com you can find some of that stuff although it's not exactly fantastic & obviously taken out of context with the rest of the film. The special make-up effects are very good but the CGI effects are poor & that space station really does look cheap. There's some nice gore including the usual skinless bodies, hooks embedded in flesh, a cool decapitation by a hook with blades on, someone is decapitated with a mirror, there's plenty of maggots & worms, lots of blood, open wounds & an exploding dog.With a supposed budget of $4,000,000 Hellraiser Bloodline is well made save for a few poor CGI effects & has that Hollywood polish about it, unfortunately that's not what the Hellraiser series is about. The acting wasn't exactly Oscar worthy if you know what I mean.Hellraiser Bloodline is a bit of a mess & I can't in all honestly see too many people getting that much from it & it comes as a huge disappointment after the previous three films all of which where pretty good especially the first two. This was the last Hellrasier film to be released theatrically, the series now stands at 8 films.

This movie is just great and certainly better than the third one and maybe even the second. I liked were the movie and its story was heading to but then it suddenly made a turn for the worse. I should had known better with a sequel that gets set in space...Still it's far from an horrible movie and it still is actually quite a watchable one. At its first halve it does a great job at further expanding the whole Hellraiser story and universe, by digging deeper into the past. Even though this the Hellraiser movie that is set in space, it also for most part is set at the present and the 18th century. The movie is being really original with its story and it was an interesting watch.The second halve felt far too rushed, as if they desperately wanted this movie to reach a spectacular conclusion. It simply doesn't fit the characters and the entire concept of Hellraiser to be within a spectacular movie. The more low key the movie plays things, the effective it works out.Luckily the character Pinhead still works out better in this movie than he did in the previous one. He's back more evil Doug Bradley handles this type of dialog way better than that of the last movie, in which he really had to act more serious.It's also a more gory movie than any of the other previous Hellraiser movies. Appereantly director Kevin Yagher shot many way more gory moments but got overruled and called back by the studio, who favored more on-screen time for the Pinhead character and pretty much did not care for much else that had to do with this movie.A movie with a really great and interesting first halve, that almost gets entirely ruined by its rushed and far less good second halve.6/10http//bobafett1138.blogspot.com/ "},{"Title":"The Scarecrow reviews Bloodline","Date":"13 August 2006","Score":"0 out of 5 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Horror, Sci-Fi","Review":" From what I understand, this was supposed to be a series of films dealing with the bloodline of a toymaker named L'Merchant who unknowingly created the dreaded puzzlebox for which is a gateway to hell where Pinhead comes from amongst other minions. If that had been the case, perhaps things would have turned out better. Instead we have three different timelines of L'Merchant placed in a 90 minute movie and I feel you can see lots of things left out. The whole film feels uneven and I never could shake the idea that post-production killed an interesting premise. The first timeline shows Phillip L'Merchant creating the puzzlebox for demented magician Duc de L'Isle(Mickey Cottrell)and his pupil Jacques(Adam Scott)who wish to summon a demon for their pleasure and servitude. Angelique(Valentina Vargas)is a prostitute who is selected for such a purpose and once she is killed, her soul is resurrected but this time it's in demonic form. I'm guessing Jacques and Angelique decided they didn't need L'Isle because when Phillip wishes to destroy the puzzlebox he finds the magician almost dead and badly beaten. He is attacked by Jacques when Angelique gets his attention and almost dead when he informs his wife to flee with their unborn child. This first story is badly underdeveloped and that might be due to cutting it into a 90 minute film. This story suffers, but the second film had much potential. This time, the setting is modern day New York and John Merchant has become quite a famous artiste extraordinaire. His design for a high-rise has a sculpted puzzlebox artform. Angelique wishes to dump Jacques and kills him when he breaks some sort of demonic rule or code(this doesn't get proper explanation). She awakens Pinhead from his puzzlebox layer thanks to a doorman who thinks he's about to get the greatest lay of his life. Instead Angelique suckers him into opening the gateway and releasing Pinhead and his demon dog upon the earth. Pinhead stays within a hidden room in the highrise for he desires for Merchant to open a much larger puzzlebox from a design in the building(this whole angle makes little sense and has some sort of connectional link with a computer). John's wife is played by Kim Myers of A Nightmare on Elm Street Part 2 fame and looks great if I might say so. Anyway, John's son is used by Pinhead as bait to open the large puzzlebox gateway in the high-rise. While this scheme is being concocted, Pinhead has a little fun with twin security guards having them crushed together. Unfortunate for Pinhead, John's wife has courage and opens the smaller puzzlebox while the inventor programs his computer to overload the larger design model to explode. The smaller puzzlebox pulls Pinhead and Angelique back inside(along with the demon dog..Myers fought them all bravely), but not before our star demon of pain killed John via beheading by chain. In the third story, Dr. Paul Merchant(who also serves as narrator to a group of soldiers assigned for some reason to bring him back to Earth)has designed an elaborate space station and brought Pinhead, Angelique, the demon dog, and the twins(now some sort of conjoined monster)out from within their small puzzlebox. The soldiers assigned to bring Paul back to Earth search the spacestation and become victims of pain thanks to Pinhead and his posse. For some reason, Paul is considered a threat to Earth so the soldiers check throughout to see why he is in space. Paul has told them why he has created this vessel and his goals to finally put an end to Pinhead forever, but this final act feels severely cut and one might wonder where Angelique and the twin monsters vanish to after they kill some soldiers. Pinhead has no idea that Paul has designed the spacestation as a uniquely created puzzlebox in the design of L'Merchant to destroy him. This whole film seems like one crudely pieced together exercise. It's incredibly nice to look at and Pinhead has much more screen time than in the next few films that will be made. He gets supplied plenty of eloquent phrases describing the pain he shall cause. He declares to some victims..I..am..pain! I particularly like the final sequence when he realizes he has been defeated and finishes the film with his final word..Amen. The film really seems to have much potential if it had been a series of films as perhaps planned by Kevin Yagher. There so many problems with the story of Pinhead and Angelique I don't know where to begin. Does Yagher abandon the third film's ending. How come the puzzlebox is in this pillar of the building and how does she know it is there(in modern day New York)? How does she even know about Pinhead and vice versa? Perhaps much back story is missing because of bad editing. What has been left on the cutting room floor? That perhaps in the ultimate question. Too much of meat is missing and all we have in this film is leftovers. It isn't all bad for like I said above..we do get to see the ominous Pinhead much more, but the what ifs of what a trilogy of stronger, more beefed up stories containing Pinhead & Angelique does have me ponder what might've been.

The film starts off in 2127 when a doctor has taken over a space station trying to find the secrets of the puzzle box. The film then flashes back to the 17th Century Paris where a toy maker creates the box so that a magician can bring demons to Earth. Finally, we then flash forward to present times where Pinhead (Doug Bradley) is back and trying to force a relative of the toy maker to build a new and bigger box. HELLRAISER BLOODLINE, according to legend, featured a pretty good screenplay, which ended up being tossed out when the producer's felt they needed more Pinhead and less story. This caused the original director to walk and what we're left with is something of a half and half between what the original screenplay called for and what the producers wanted. I can't imagine a Director's Cut being much better since he apparently didn't get to film everything he wanted to but either way what we're left with is a real disaster as nothing ever makes too much sense and you can't help but feel as if you're watching something that incomplete. The biggest problem I had with the film is that there isn't an ounce of energy in the thing. Not once do you feel any sort of emotion be it tension, drama or anything else so it's impossible to really care about anything going on. There's no humor or anything else so you're pretty much just sitting there becoming more and more bored with each passing minute. None of the three segments are very entertaining and in reality they don't mix too well either. The stuff set in the future looks cheaper than those ALIEN rip-offs that Roger Corman was making in the early 80s and the space station is just downright laughable. The Paris stuff isn't much better because it's so dry. Then we have the stuff set in modern times but this too is rather boring and doesn't contain a bit of imagination. The performances really aren't too bad and some of the special effects are good but this really can't help overcome all the major issues with the film. With such a lackluster screenplay and a messy production, HELLRAISER BLOODLINE is a complete misfire on most levels. "}]
