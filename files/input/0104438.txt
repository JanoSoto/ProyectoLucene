[{"Title":"We're caught in a trap...","Date":"4 October 1999","Score":"14 out of 18 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Romance, Thriller","Review":"  I always thought that it was strange that the film Indecent Proposal was released not long after Honeymoon in Vegas and that no one seemed to make anything of the overt similarities between their plots, which involve men who gamble away their fiancees. Both films take a generally misogynistic approach to romance, although the antics in Vegas are generally less repulsive than the typical romantic comedy fodder that, in most states, would usually constitute some form of stalking or harrassment.Honeymoon in Vegas, however, is not nearly so maladjusted. Unfortunately, it isn't so funny, either. There are some choice one-liners and a great climactic scene involving the Flying Elvises, but it generally isn't very engaging because the plot and most of the characters are rather dull.But Cage and Parker are both monumentally talented and charming, and they somehow manage to carry this film through its lapses in quality.A side note Honeymoon in Vegas has BY FAR one of the best soundtracks EVER-- the wide array of Elvis cover-songs is simply amazing Billy Joel's take on All Shook Up and Dwight Yoakam's he's the singer who covered Queen's Crazy Little Thing Called Love for the Gap commercial, fyi rendition of Suspicious Minds really stand out among a truly stellar collection. Hearing this music in the background will carry you through most of the less-than-interesting moments of Vegas.Rating 6 out of 10. Not bad. Parker, Cage, and the soundtrack make Honeymoon in Vegas, at the very least, a WATCHABLE film with some very enjoyable moments scattered throughout. It's worth seeing once, and the soundtrack is definitely worth picking up from the discount bins.

(She's also quite easy to look at I might add).Everything goes wrong for Cage, as he races across hell and high water trying to catch up with the girl he wants to marry, but of course wacky high-jinx ensues.  Hey, if nothing else, you can't go wrong with Las Vegas and Hawaii as your two main locations.  A very good, funny film.

You can't completely negate a movie that involves a desperate man who tries to gain back the love of his fiance by jumping out of a plane dressed like Elvis.  The flying Elvises concept is definitely an original touch, but there are others as well.  I like the running gag involving Robert Costanzo suspecting that his fat, ugly wife is cheating on him with Mike Tyson because of obviously doctored photos of her and Iron Mike.  There's also that great scene with the 5-year-old Elvis impersonator, who's actually quite good.  Anne Bancroft makes a brief but funny appearance at the beginning of the film.  Peter Boyle also has a funny cameo as Chief Orman, an Indian Chief who has a love for showtunes.  James Caan gives his usually savvy performance.  I could've done without the cliched fat henchman character, who basically repeats everything that Caan says and bumbles all over the place.  Nicolas Cage is over-the-top as the paranoid Jack, but his overacting works in the context of the film, and he's often very funny.  And finally, who can resist a film with tons of Elvis songs in the soundtrack?

I watched it solely because Nicholes Cage, one of my favorite actors was in it, so I thought it couldn't be that bad. And I was right. It was actually better then I thought it would be.There isn't any way to describe this movie except a lighter, funnier, sappier version of Indecent proposal. While indecent proposal the book, was great, the movie was pretty bad. This however, was a really fun time from beginning to end. Cage and parker make an adorable screen couple and James Caan was absolutely great. This movie hooks you, in the first five minutes, and retains a fun atmosphere throughout. It doesn't hurt that the two main settings for the movie are Las Vegas and Hawaii. The movie will make you want to visit both places. It is also peppered with unforgettable funny characters amidst two great settings, one a non stop party(Vegas) and one stunning peaceful island beauty(Hawai).What's also great about this movie is it is actually unpredictable in a few places and I don't say that lightly because there are not a lot of romantic comedies that can do that. Give you the warm fuzzies-oh yeah most of them do that no problem, but it's the rare romantic comedy that can leave you guessing.For me, I didn't know, at first, who parker's Betsy would actually end up with. Cage is at first, presented as a jerk who yells almost non stop through the first part. And Tommy actually appears to be, if a little questionable, genuinely attracted to Parker. And the two have chemistry as well. So I wasn't quite sure which road the movie would choose to take.That Tommy ultimately becomes much nastier then he was at first presented was, to me, at first a disappointment, and didn't seem to go with what I'd seen so far, but the end made it worth it as this tops many romantic comedies with it's Completely over the top yet somehow appropriate, ending. The sky diving sequence was thrilling, not to mention how fun the Elvis impersonators were. This movie is an easy 7, maybe even a bit higher(7.5) and is a movie I'd completely recommend, it's fun, it's funny, it's pretty, and it's well acted. Makes a great summer's late night watch and should be rated a bit higher on here.

Its possible it contains the word Elvis more than any other mainstream movie.  The impersonators of every nationality, the Flying Elvises at the climax and, as user 'lawndale' pointed out, the soundtrack is one of the best.   Aside from the King, there is still a very funny movie here.  Cage was doing small comedies at the time (Guarding Tess and It Could Happen to You are two of them), and this fits in with those other light entertainments, as far as that goes.  He does 'frustrated' comedy pretty well; Ben Stiller would have been in this if it were made today, since he seems to be the new 'victim' in today's comedies.  All the comedy is totally dependent on Cage's performance, and he delivers in ways I would not have thought possible. His next trip to Vegas (in Leaving Las Vegas)should have been as much fun.

Nicolas Cage stars as Jack Singer, a guy in love but hampered by a promise he may or may not have made to his mother, Bea (Anne Bancroft), on her deathbed, which causes him to drag his heels on the path to the altar.  When he finally manages a breakthrough, he spirits his girl, Betsy (Sarah Jessica Parker), off to Las Vegas with the intention of tying the knot once and for all.  But before the plan can come to fruition, enter professional gambler (and widower) Tommy Korman (James Caan), who spots Betsy in the lobby of a hotel.  what follows involves something of a twist in plot, but suffice to say, Jack is about to face a personal baptism by fire.  And Betsy may be the flame, but Korman is the flint. 	It's an amusing comedy that never gets too deep beneath the surface or purports to be anything but what it is, though the plot does dip in to a bit of a gray area, morally speaking.  The performances are good all around, though nothing here is anything approaching a stretch for any of the principals involved.  Cage conveys the angst of his situation with aplomb, and employs that hang-dog look he does so well to great effect while his emotions implode.  Parker looks fetching and makes a credible character of Betsy, but even though the action revolves around her there is not a whole lot for her to sink her teeth into with this part.  But to her credit she handles what she is given to work with convincingly enough.  Caan looks every bit the part of Korman; in fact, to put this part over he had little more to do than show up.  Even at that, there are times when he takes it just a trifle over the top.  The supporting cast includes Pat Morita (Mahi Mahi), Johnny Williams (Johnny Sandwich), Seymour Cassel (Tony Cataracts) and Peter Boyle, who creates one of the more memorable scenes in the movie, as Chief Orman. 	With `Honeymoon In Vegas,' Bergman has put together a film that, while not entirely memorable, is good for some laughs (the highlight of which is when Jack must of necessity interact with the flying Elvis impersonators).  In the end, with some popcorn and a little imagination, for Cage fans especially, this movie will make for a satisfying evenings entertainment.  I rate this one 6/10.

Two years later would seem them collaborate once more with It Could Happen To You, a film that is equally as funny and equally as under-appreciated. The pair work really well together as Bergman's style of comedy utilises what makes Cage such a good actor, his ability to portray anxiety in a way that makes you laugh and yet still be fully sympathetic with his plight.In a pretty high concept plot, Cage plays a private detective, haunted with dreams of his dead mother, who is in a long term relationship with a teacher played by Sarah Jessica Parker but is afraid to tie the knot. Relationship troubles persuade Cage to take the plunge, deciding to head off to Vegas to get married as fast as possible before he is able to change his mind. The comedy really kicks in when James Caan's character, a wealthy professional gambler, spots Cage's fiancée and decides to pursue her himself using the most underhand of tactics as she looks similar to his recently deceased wife.Granted, the premise might not be the most edgy or original of ones but it consistently manages to serve up some really funny moments. Towards the end it starts to slightly go off the boil with James Caan's character seeming to change in a way that seems geared to reach a resolution rather than unfold naturally. This problem only really briefly manifests itself in places throughout the last fifteen minutes of the film, but can't really detract from the heartwarming climax involving a planeload of skydiving Elvises.If you are looking for a goofy comedy to watch that you don't need to think about a great deal then you'll not do much better than Honeymoon in Vegas. If you are still not convinced then watch it because Sarah Jessica Parker spends a lot of the time scantily clad, and this is before she looked like some genetic engineering atrocity where the DNA of a horse was spliced with a prune.

Nicholas Cage was pretty good here, just not as good here as he has been in other movies. The script for honeymoon in Vegas is really just average, kind of mediocre in my opinion. James Caan was actually pretty spot on in his own role and I thought it was a good casting decision to cast him in Tommys role, but once again nothing all that great to work with I'm afraid. The comedy in this film is pretty poor, it's not funny as all. I literally never laughed once, not once, and that is a very bad sign for a comedy film, a very bad sign obviously lol.

But then again, he also did Striptease and the remake of The In-Laws. I'm talking about Andrew Bergman here, who wrote and directed this movie and just doesn't seem to quite have the right skills and qualities for the genre. I mean, he can definitely write and tell a good story and he can handle some decent characters but he just can't quite seem to get a grip on the right tone and style for a comedy. The movie does have some fun and crazy moments in it but even when watching these moments you'll have the idea and feeling that if they had pushed it a bit further all this movie could had truly been hilarious. In this particular case it probably wouldn't had harmed the movie if they went a bit over-the-top with it all.Nevertheless, it still really is a perfectly watchable movie that doesn't really ever bore and you'll simply have a good time watching it. It is still a movie with more hits than misses in it. Those hits just aren't very hard however.It's of course also really a movie that gets made interesting by its cast. When you have a cast with Nicolas Cage, Sarah Jessica Parker, James Caan and a strong supporting cast as well, you are of course quite blessed as a film-maker.

Still, there are many good gags throughout most notably the different types of Elvises and some funny PA announcements that you'll only catch with the subtitles on. The soundtrack is amazing and the closing fifteen minutes start to re-capture the hilarity of the first few scenes, but ultimately there's just too much time allotted to Nicolas Cage screaming and James Caan sweet-talking Parker.

Sure enuf, you go see and then, after 15 minutes, you just want to go period.  This stinker was SO bad it made me angry! I wanted my money back.  Why the reviews have been from good to excellent on this one is totally beyond me.Nicolas Cage and airhead Sarah Jessica Parker headline this misguided slapstick as a long-standing couple who finally decide to tie the knot after years of hedging on his part.  They head to (where else?) Las Vegas to make it official wherein Cage proceeds to lose Parker in a stacked poker game set up by a big time mobster (Jimmy Caan).  Trying to win her back is supposedly the fun part of this comedy what with all the crazy problems that ensue and inane characters he encounters.It's all for nought.  Cage and Parker, known for their loopy auras, are just plain dumb here, as is everything and everybody else associated with this dreck.  Cage, who has always been an acquired taste, was FUNNIER in Leaving Las Vegas! (That's  a joke, guys, and better than anything you'll find here.)  Parker, who can be a sexy, delightful featherbrain (catch her in L.A. Story) is entirely wasted here.Supposedly full of inventive bits, it has more the feel of somebody who stitched a bunch of stupid, tasteless, half-baked ideas together using very weak thread.  Offbeat director Andrew Bergman has done better work I suppose (It Could Happen to You -- also with Cage) but, to tell you the truth, I just don't connect with his style or humor.As far as I'm concerned, a THOUSAND flying Elvises couldn't save this turkey!

His writing & directing is pretty much related to adult comedy. Starting with being a writer on the brilliant Blazing Saddles, this entry is uneven with some comic moments & some awkward moments as well.Nicholas Cage holds this film together for most viewers. The plot is something below the comedy which holds the film together but is not something whole. The film, to its credit, follows the plot through to a logical conclusion.There are some good comic moments in the film. James Cann is the bad guy and plays his role straight as the bad guy who sets himself up with Cages newly minted wife(Sarah Jessica Parker) on their honeymoon by taking Cage on a big betin a rigged poker game.The late Pat Morita is the best of a pretty good supporting cast. Morita is more known from Arnold on Happy Days & the Karate Kid series. Here he is a cab driver in Hawaii who is supposed to keep Cage away from his wife while Tommy Corman (Cann) tries to score with her.The beginning of the film has some good comedy. The ending with the flying Elvis's is inspired too. It is the middle of the film, in spite of Morita's presence which bogs down some. This film is a pleasant diversion but not a must see unless your a Cage fan as he does dominate this film.

Eventually, however, he gives in to Betsy's entreaties and agrees to go back on his promise. The two arrange to get married in Las Vegas, but on arrival in the city another obstacle presents itself. Betsy catches the eye of a wealthy professional gambler named Tommy Korman because she reminds him of his late wife. After winning $65,000 from Jack in a crooked poker game, Korman agrees to forgive the debt if Jack will allow him to spend the weekend with Betsy.The situation is somewhat reminiscent of that from another film from the early nineties, Indecent Proposal, in which a wealthy man offers a young married couple $1,000,000 to spend a night with the wife. Indecent Proposal, however, was intended as a serious drama, whereas Honeymoon in Vegas is played for laughs. Moreover, in Indecent Proposal the young woman, played by Demi Moore, was expected to sleep with Robert Redford's millionaire; here, Betsy only (reluctantly) agrees to go along with Korman's proposal on a strict no sex basis. Nevertheless, during the weekend they spend in Hawaii, Betsy finds herself falling for Korman. Can Jack win her back? With his lanky figure and long, lugubrious-looking face, Nicolas Cage does not really have the looks of a Hollywood leading man, but here he seems admirably suited to the role of Jack, the sort of lovable if eccentric loser who eventually turns out to be a winner, and deservedly so because for all his faults and eccentricities he is basically decent. In the final scene Jack has to make a parachute jump from 3,000 feet with a team of skydiving Elvis impersonators in order to reach Betsy before Korman can marry her. This struck me as a modern, comic take on all those old legends in which a hero or knight-errant has to perform some brave feat in order to win the hand of a fair lady. James Caan's Korman, by contrast, might initially seem affable, but beneath a jovial exterior he has a mean streak a mile wide, a streak which starts to show as soon as anyone crosses him. As they say, lucky at cards, unlucky in love.I was less taken with Sarah Jessica Parker, perhaps because I am so used to her as the hard, brassy Carrie Bradshaw from Sex and the City that it was difficult for me to accept her as a softer character like Betsy. One character I could have done with less of was the annoying Pat Morita's Mahi Mahi, Tommy's Hawaiian driver charged with trying to keep Jack away from Tommy and Betsy. Overall, however, Honeymoon in Vegas is an agreeable and occasionally amusing, if slight, rom-com. 6/10 "},{"Title":"An average comedy from the early 90s","Date":"8 August 2005","Score":"1 out of 3 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Romance, Thriller","Review":" Honeymoon in Las Vegas is a decent comedy spoof, but nothing special.

Unfortunately though, Andrew Bergman seems to have been succumbing to the inevitable gravity of a rather slippery slope ever since that success (as the role of producer on the horrendous Striptease will attest) and this film certainly falls short of what it might have promised on paper.Although the script is rather laboured and clunky there are some genuine moments of comedy, a few one-liners that you will be repeating to your friends for a couple of weeks after seeing the movie and a pretty original climax involving a troupe of sky diving Elvis impersonators and a rather miffed James Caan.Although I would agree with a lot of the other reviews that the soundtrack is excellent and even Sarah Jessica Parker puts in a good performance if you're going to see a Sin City based movie starring Nicholas Cage make it 'Leaving&#x85;' and not 'Honeymoon in'. A solid five out of ten, not unwatchable, but far short of a classic.

Nutty comedy relies on stray eccentricities to put it over, but aside from the three leads, nothing about this scenario is very interesting.

That was what happened with this film, for me, at least, and I fear it will happen for many other people. There's no good way to warn people about the dangers of such a casual way of buying films, so I just hope people will look past the three familiar faces on the cover and smell the stench of this turd of a film. The plot is an obvious rip-off of Indecent Proposal(the book, not the movie... I know this came out first), and it's quite poorly written, for coming from so good source material. It's basically a cat-and-mouse game with Caan trying to keep Cage away from Parker, trick her into staying with him, moving back and forth whilst he has people slowing Cage down. The acting is overdone and uninspired. Cage yells and goes off in fits of rage every few minutes, Parker basically just stands by and looks pretty while going back and forth between the two men(emotionally, not literally), and Caan just does his gangster-shtick. The dialog is vapid. The chemistry is close to non-existent. The many Elvises in the film, as well as the two main settings, Las Vegas and Hawaii just shows how hard the director tries to sell this film. He can't think up good scenes or interesting characters, so he just throws in stuff he figures everybody likes. Everyone likes Elvis, right? Yeah... when there's one of him, and he can actually sing. Every song by him on the film's score is sung by other people(probably because they didn't want the hassle of buying the rights to use his vocals along with his lyrics). In short; the film just isn't funny. It tries way too hard, and winds up looking like some under-produced unknown little 80's comedy with either actors who can only do one character or actors who have never worked, neither before nor later. Caan, Cage and Parker deserve better. I just wish they would have realized how awful it was going to turn out and not signed on to do the film. Instead, I stand here with about 90 minutes of my life almost completely wasted... and I urge you to take heed, follow my warning... don't make the same mistake I did. Don't watch this movie, don't buy it, or any other's you don't know anything about, no matter how cheap they are. You were warned.
