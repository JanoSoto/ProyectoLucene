They stick to each other and just have the best time together. In school they were outcasts but it never phased them one bit. They currently reside in L.A. and are exactly how they were in school. When they hear that there is a high school reunion, they are over joyed about going back to meet everyone again; even their nemesis the A group. But they realise that people might not be impressed with their lives, so they think of a lie that makes them look really successful. But from this simple lie their friendship is broken apart and are made the laughing stock at the reunion.Romy and Michele's High School Reunion is a great little comedy of nostalgia; looking back upon school years, the fashion, the music and how people were back then; seeing that they've changed or just stayed completely the same.Overall this doesn't say much; there is that moral that friendship is the most important and to stand by your friends in any situation. There is that idea also that when people look back upon school years people realise if they were liked or not; Christy and the A group finding they were the most hated and despised and that the 'freaks' of school go on to be the most successful.Mira Sorvino and Lisa Kudrow fit their characters perfectly; giving so much energy and naivety to them. Janeane Garofalo was great as the surly, fowl mouthed Heather Mooney and Alan Cumming as the nerdy Sandy Frink is also great.It isn't the best comedy, but its still a great watch. Makes you look upon your own school years.

They also adore going out to the dance clubs every night and looking for their own potentially rich boyfriends. However, on most evenings they end up turning down invitations from jerks and dancing with each other instead. Word arrives that their ten year high school reunion is approaching. Since Romy and Michele were certified geeks at school, they get the idea that they will make a triumphant return as winners. After all, they both look pretty and they can make up the rest. So, they outfit themselves as successful businesswoman, with a hot car and cell phone and take off for Arizona. Will they be able to fool the old gang with their new, trumped-up identities? This is a classic tale of dumb blondes who are clueless but, who nevertheless, end up making good. Sorvino and Kudrow are perfection itself as the dimwitted but lovely blondes. Janeane Garofalo is also on hand to steal scenes with her acid wit and intelligence. The costumes are to die for and the overall production values are very nice. But, most importantly, the humor is abundant and zestful. If you need to drop all your worries and get your fighting spirit back, spend an evening with the delightful Romy and Michele. They will make you giggle and get you ready to face the more somber world again with a renewed and optimistic attitude.

But I've never gotten a chance to see this movie until now. The verdict is while there are some funny moments, and the ending is good, there are enough dead spots to only get it a lukewarm recommendation.Romy (Mira Sorvino) and Michele (Lisa Kudrow) are two best friends...and first class ditzes. Both of their IQs are far below what is considered normal, and the term Valley Girl seems to have been tailor made for them. They are living stylishly in LA when an old school chum Heather Mooney (Janeane Garafalo) tells them about their high school reunion. But seeing as the only reason to go to the high school reunion is to boast about their careers (neither Romy or Michele has an enviable job), they decide to lie and pass themselves off as rich and wealthy business women. And the creators of Post-It Notes.The problem with the film is that it's too plot heavy for its own good. These two bimbos are hilarious in their own right, but Robin Schiff's screenplay (based on her play) spends too much time developing the story and not enough time letting the characters be themselves. There are plenty of flashbacks about how the Queen Bees of their school bullied them, but this material comes off as cruel, rather than funny. The movie is at it's best when it allows them to be the ultra-dim bulbs that they are, but there just aren't enough of these moments.Lisa Kudrow and Mira Sorvino are terrific as the leads. Romy is the smarter one, although that's not saying much. Neither one is a stranger to playing a mental vacuum, and they're pretty funny. Surprisingly, Janeane Garafalo is ineffective as the cynical Heather. The character has to add a dose of emotional damage to her character, but Garafalo goes way far over the top. Garafalo can play a dramatic character, but she's just not very good in this film. Alan Cumming is good as the geek who has long held a torch for Michele. Camryn Manheim steals her scenes as the organizer. She's one of those people who is so into this thing that she doesn't realize that no one else really cares. We all know someone like this, and that's what makes it funny.Some people have been calling this a chick flick, and that's not necessarily true. It's not a sappy romance, and while the central characters are girls, the humor is such that members of both sexes can get it.Fluff, but not that great fluff.

The 90s managed to generate some really neat exercises in irony, the blonde heroine who in her own fashionable and dizzy way stumbles upon self-empowerment and manages to stand up to the face of society, but this is no Clueless, mostly because the extended dream sequence just before the third act doesn't look, feel, or flow any different than the rest of the movie. The acting is uneven, too--Lisa Kudrow gets nowhere near the empathy Mira Sorvino illicits, and neither of them are nearly as interesting and Janeane Garofolo.However, honestly, once the three-way dance between Kudrow, Sorvino, and Cumming occurs, all bets are off. I felt higher than coke-addicted drunk mixing a cocktail of LSD and heroin to the mix for extra flavor. Seriously, the writing of this movie is straight-forward enough but the tone and progression of it is unaccountable. I can actually see the cult enjoyment this film gets, but whereas I was expecting something more along the Sugar and Spice lines, I wasn't expecting Legally Blonde meets Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas.What a weird friggin' movie...--PolarisDiB "}{"Title":"Do you have some kind of businesswomen's special?","Date":"2 January 2005","Score":"7 out of 10 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy","Review":" Yeah, 'cause we're businesswomen.

This movie is dopey and fun and you don't have to think very much, so it's great if you just want to chill for a couple of hours. Romy and Michele are perfect examples of the iconic vapid, superficial southern California beach girl. Their ignorance makes them endearing, and when Romy's heart is broken at the prom and Michele offers a consolation dance, you can't help feeling sorry for her. The music is great, it's all eighties like Bananarama and Wang Chung and Kenny Loggins. The dance sequences, in the disco and at the reunion, are well done and perfectly suited to the style of this movie. My favorite scene in the whole film relates to the quote in my summary, when they walk into the eatery and ask the waitress if they have a businesswomen's special, because they're businesswomen in a hurry.

One of the girls dreams about the reunion that could have been should they have gone with most of what they planned, ending with them growing old and hating each other, but then the real reunion begins.

Of course, the whole deception crashes around their ears, but through the experience, Romy and Michele discover that their lives have been much richer than they had realised.The comedy of Romy and Michele veers towards the extremely silly at times, and is unlikely to appeal to those who enjoy more cerebral humour, but the underlying, heartfelt messages, the effervescent performances from its likable (and luscious) leads, excellent support from Janeane Garofolo (as class grouch Heather Mooney) and Alan Cumming (as nerd-turned-millionaire Sandy Frink), and spirited direction from David Mirkin are guaranteed to provide a fun time for all but the most joyless of souls.

Romy runs into her high school classmate Heather Mooney (Janeane Garofalo) who is now wealthy with news of the upcoming Sagebrush High School 10th year reunion in Tuscon. The girls decide to go but then they realize that they are not as successful as they thought they were. Despite their best efforts, two weeks are not enough and they decide to lie about their lives. When the girls were in high school, they were picked on by popular mean girl Christy Masters. Romy was in love with Christy's boyfriend Billy Christianson and they played a trick on Romy. Michele was in a back brace. Mooney was secretly in love with fellow geek Sandy Frink but he was in love with Michele.Mira Sorvino and Lisa Kudrow have both played iconic dim-witted blonds. In this movie, they pull together their performances and it's a wonderful pairing. Their friendship is really the glue that holds this movie together. The dream sequence in the middle could have been cut down. Also Sandy Frink could have been played by a hot nerd rather than Alan Cumming. There are some hilarious fun and some uncomfortable awkwardness. I would have loved these great actresses go for a sequel.

Not a big fan of Friends and never have been, but Lisa Kudrow is really funny in this, and so is the other star (whose name escapes me).They're basically not very bright, materialistic, and only really care about themselves and each other.

It's not like they are plain Janes that work as clerks in the 7-Eleven.Second I did not find their old classmates all that offensive or uppity. It was just difficult to imagine the two as underdogs being degraded or the subjects of snobbery.

Alan Cumming is the most prominent support as the school geek with a crush on Kudrow's Michelle who grows up to be a multi-millionaire inventor and who comes to their rescue, with helicopter, naturally.The funniest scene by far is the threesome's show-dance at the end and there are some other amusing scenes and lines too along the way, but probably not enough of them. Still, rather like TV's Laverne and Shirley from the 70's, Kudrow and Sorvino have you rooting for them from the start and it's their cuteness, kookiness and finally loyalty to one another which ultimately make this an amiable if shallow watch.

Not a flop, but far below expectations. At the end of the day, movies are about making money. So despite proving her chops as a comedy actress, Sorvino didn't get a second chance. She tried many other genres, but somehow always picked movies that didn't do well at the box office. (She's now in a new TV series Intruders) Kudrow has done a bit better, but never became an A-lister.Why didn't Romy and Michele do better? Perhaps it was expectations. The caliber of the cast and the fun premise has us expecting something far better. On first viewing I was very disappointed. I almost hated it.But the first 45 minutes is very good. It has enough laughs, and the characters (and the actresses) have a lot of charisma. Romy and Michele are a Folie à deux; a happy pair of fools who share the same delusion. They're fun to watch and it looks like we're in for a real treat.But after that first 45 minutes, with a few exceptions, the movie falls flat. The last hour of the movie is about the reunion itself, but this is poorly told and poorly directed. Laughs are few and far between. The whole thing is carried on two very weak jokes, which in a sitcom would no more two throwaway lines. But instead of hitting us with new jokes, Director Mirkin and Writer Schiff recycle the same two weak jokes over and over again.This has been done before and done much better. Even teen comedies like Patrick Dempsey's Money can't buy me love have a far more compelling plot. So after the build up, we're left disappointed. Perhaps it was bad word of mouth that killed it.But I watched it again, and while my comments still apply about that last hour, there's still a lot to like. Sorvino and Kudrow are brilliant, and there are iconic scenes (like Garofalo's Cowboy) which carry a lot of weight and a few good gags (the suit cracked me up). If there were more of these, the movie would have been a classic. The interpretive dance at the end is nerdy but very sweet and I loved their Stayin' Alive too.For the first 45 minutes I'd give it 8/10 (4 stars), but that last hour drags it down to 6/10 (2 stars).There have been attempts to relaunch Romy and Michele. In 2005 Shiff launched a TV series which by IMDb comments was badly written. Sorvino and Kudrow are begging Disney (Touchstone) to let them do a sequel, but Disney is baulking. Perhaps they can't imagine a movie with two 40 year old female leads? Perhaps they think the Valley girl undertones are passé? Perhaps Disney don't want to give up the rights either? Hollywood is competitive, and studios have been known to buy rights to scripts just to stop another studios possibly making a hit.And perhaps after two disappointing outings they don't think Shiff can deliver? I think Shiff had a wonderful germ of an idea here. If she stands back and lets more experienced comedy writers take it further, her franchise may yet deliver.

Since they were misfits in high school they lie about their success and face the ramifications thereof. Janeane Garofalo is on hand as a no-nonsense fellow high schooler.While this comedy is fairly amusing and many elements of the story ring true, it's told from the protagonists' perspective (naturally) and would therefore appeal more to women. I'm on the fence with Sorvino and Kudrow -- I neither like nor dislike them -- so it's the story and peripheral characters that are going to make or break the film for people like me, but I can't remember that many memorable parts even though I saw the movie two days ago, which isn't a good sign. On the plus side there's no raunch.So it's worth checking out if what I said piques your interest but, for me, meh.The film runs 92 minutes and was shot in the general Los Angeles area.GRADE C "},{"Title":"Smiles and giggles and hugs all over!!","Date":"9 June 2014","Score":"","Genre":"Comedy","Review":" This movie left me with giggles and smiles all over!

The simplicity of the characters, though predictable, is very lovable. Usually, I'd be P.O.-ed if the movies get to predictable but this is one of the rare ones that is actually bearable to watch. I'm fond of it even. They hit the home run on all of the obvious tropes. And the dance sequence and the ending!! UGH.

Also, the movie actually holds palpable but meaningful lessons that you learn after high school (or when you get over it - or else you might just end up like Christy and Billy).All in all, this movie is a feel good movie that is very relatable and will bring some fond (but some may be bitter) memories from high school days.

We can't say, I'm the President of the United States or I'm a big movie star, but we can dream of coming up with something to impress that makes us seem better than who we really are. In the case of Romy and Michelle, they want to get past the memories of being mistreated by the A group at their Tucson Arizona high school, boys who either didn't know who the heck they were or got excited just by being near them, and come back to their Venice Beach California home with some sort of dignity.So what do these cool fun women who make great party outfits do? They come up with a whopper of a lie and claim to have invented that item that everybody knows about but whom nobody seems to know who invented it Post-Its! One invented the glue, the other chose the color. Cool, right? It all seems to work until a former rival who ran into one of them at their uncool job at a car rental shop shows up and threatens to spill the beans.A great mix of dumb blonde comedy, fun 80's music, bad 80's hair and the slobs versus the snobs, Romy and Michelle's High School Reunion is a comedy of stupidity that works in a very subtle intelligence level. The two friends are obviously devoted to each other, and as played by Oscar Winner Mira Sorvino and TV's Lisa Kudrow, they seem as perfect a couple as Lucy and Ethel, Mary and Rhoda, Laverne and Shirley, Patsy and Edina, well, you get the drift. I'm the Mary, You're the Rhoda! one yells at the other during a sudden argument, and this threatens to split them apart. You're the Jewish one!, the Mary wanna-be tells the other. But once they see the nasty girls who are still just as nasty, loyalty is not only tested but things are revealed about the A group that many of us can attest to from high school reunions we've gone to.Jeanene Garafalo is hysterical as the class freak, a goth-girl/genius who has invented the quick-burning cigarette. Broadway vet Alan Cumming goes through several different looks as a nerdy geek who becomes a multi-millionaire, and Julia Campbell perfectly spoofs the spunky cheerleader type who manipulates her friends (all but one) and is obviously overly self-obsessed. It takes a while for the film to get going, mostly vignettes of Romy and Michelle's life together, trying to find a good job, find a decent boyfriend and dealing with the sexy Latin lothario that the one works with at the car rental place. But even though there's a long-time of set-up, it is all done in fun, and when meshed together (even with a fantasy sequence that threatens to slow down the film but really doesn't) the result is a future film classic that late baby boomers can particularly relate to (like me) and younger audiences will see some of the build-up to what has become now their generation. So have a ball, pull out your Cindy Lauper records, Madonna outfits, and just enjoy. "},{"Title":"LOL where it started...

Why, yes! And it's even enjoyable to finally get to see them shop!I used to describe this movie as the female Dumb & Dumber, and in reality, Romy and Michele's High School Reunion is, in fact, just that. But, let me assure you it's 10x funnier and has more originality than the Jim Carrey movie will ever have.I just rewatched this movie for the, I dunno, fifteenth time and even though it's been about a decade since I last saw it, I found myself laughing out loud so many times, I couldn't count. So many memories, so many great characters, so many rude behaviors that would normally make me squeamish, made me burst out this time. Again, I understand hardly anyone is a good person in this, but their so-outrageous behavior made this slapstick comedy all the more enjoyable.Further, so many scenes and lines brought back such great recollections that I marveled in the comedic genius behind the screenplay. One that stood out, that made me stood up to watch, was the (Mild-spoiler, sorry) Romy-Tell-Off scene towards the end. I could watch that few-second scene dozens of times and never tire of it.(One more major spoiler, and if you haven't yet seen this, please skip to the next paragraph&#x85;) When I first saw this in theatres, I thought this movie was just okay and when it came to a scene that one character dreams of what the reunion is going to be like, I rolled my eyes. Here we go again, I thought, for in many sitcoms, much like The Brady Bunch or movies, one character will dream of events they've never partaken in, but are worried about, and lo, following the dream, the next day, normally, they encounter the exact same scene/set up, even though it was physically impossible for them to predict/dream of what was to come when they've never encountered it. Here, Michele dreams of their pending High School Reunion, but, upon waking, the actual reunion is far different from what she imagined. Now, that's real life. That's exactly what would really happen. It was that moment that I admired and LOVED this film.Romy & Michele reminisce on their high school days of Tucson, Arizona's past once told about their upcoming high school reunion. But tensions rise between the non-gay BFF ditzy blondes of (now) L.A.'s beaches when the truth of who's (a VERY tad bit) smarter than the other right before they get to the reunion. Will they make up? Will the endless and set-up in advance old high school students finally realize who they were meant to be with or avoid?It is a comedy after all.With one of the best soundtracks, after all. And cleverest lines, and deep acting for a slapstick comedy. And fairly good cinematography and overall originality. It's also one of the absolutely funniest movies that still holds up today, for the most part &#x96; Flip phones, anyone? &#x96; of all time.Revisiting this movie, I now realized it's been far too long between viewings.

Her glazed-over dumb face in scenes where the pair confront the A-group chicks is hilarious. The school social structure portrayed in the movie, albeit presented in a highly clichéd form, will ring true for many viewers. At the top of the social scale are the attractive and self-confident kids who are often arrogant, mean and shallow. In the moral scheme of the movie they are seen to pay the price for these deficits ten years down the track, for example, relationship failure and alcohol abuse. As I'm sure many have experienced, people don't change and it can be pointless attempting to make friends with people who shunned you at school. But it is the wacky scenes in the movie which redeem it Romy's dream while waiting in the car, invention as a means of creating unlikely wealth (fast-burn cigarettes, Postit notes), and the opening scene where the couple are watching Pretty Women for the 67?th time instead of playing down the beach. In short, some of the acting, wackiness and the grains of truth in the storyline save this movie from being total crap.

The comedic timing of all the actors was right on and the movie, though it was kind of making fun of, for some, real high school experiences, managed to do so without condescending or, IMO, pandering (too much). What we have are 2 young women, 10 years after graduating high school, who seem to really have gone nowhere. But for them, until they learn about the reunion, that's just fine. They somehow manage to survive and are enjoying their lives and are truly happy. Of course they are just 28 so one must keep that point in mind. Still plenty of time to figure out one's life. The story then revolves around them learning about their 10-year high school reunion and they want to go, but Romy, who on the surface seems to be the smarter of the 2, wants to do so but make an impression by showing the A List group that they are now successful. Each of us has been in one of those groups, though called something different depending on your generation, but the premise is the same whether one attended high school in the 50s, 60s, 70s or 80s (even the 90s). There are always those kids who are the most popular and some of them are some of the biggest bullies on campus, making life for everyone else miserable. The geeks and nerds (who usually are the ones who head off to get graduate degrees and thus making some decent money and become very successful). The artsy group. The loners and others that just do not fit into any group, thus make their own groups, such as what Romy and Michelle did. So the 2 end up going to the reunion, and have come up with a story about how they have become successful, though in the process end up having a huge fight about it. Probably because in their hearts they know this is wrong, and after they have been exposed they realize that being a fake gets you nowhere, and as they learn, the worse thing that can ever happen is to lose one's best friend. Everyone should just be who they are, and this includes those snotty I think I am better than everyone else group. Thankfully, most of those people grow up and realize they were awful. Of course, this is Hollywood and we must have a happy ending with the villains getting their due, which happens of course, and in a quite clever way I might add, and we end the movie with our 2 ditsy blondes actually becoming successful. The moral of the story could be, What goes around comes around. Check it out for an afternoon of easy entertainment.

Excited about the possibility of showing up their snotty peers who tormented them in high-school, Romy and Michele borrow a fancy car and head for their class reunion. On the way they hatch an elaborate success story....they are going to tell everyone that they invented post-it notes. Sounds easy enough. Nobody really knows who invented post-it notes, right? Wrong. Janeane Garofolo's character eventually shows up in the middle of this conversation and spoils their plan, embarrassing them in front of the A-crowd, which they were trying to impress. But that's not the end of it. A former A-crowd member(who was smart enough to disassociate herself)has become a successful fashion editor for Vogue magazine and is quite impressed with Romy's and Michele's self-made outfits. In the end they become the successful women that they wanted to be, and all from an area of expertise which was right at their fingertips.The main thing that holds this movie up is the two fabulous leads, Sorvino and Kudrow, whom I believe to be great in all of their roles. They really make their characters believable, albeit they are only playing dumb blonds. Still, if you like nothing else about 'Romy and Michele's High-School Reunion'(it's only medium-funny), then you'll at least enjoy the subdued work of Kudrow and the cuteness of Sorvino and her accent. Unless you don't like chick movies, then, really, it's worth a viewing. But it's probably an acquired taste...

"},{"Title":"Average comedy with excellent casting.","Date":"16 June 2004","Score":"","Genre":"Comedy","Review":"  ROMY AND MICHELE'S HIGH SCHOOL REUNION is one of those movies that isn't necessarily terrific, but very lovable nonetheless. It's the story of Romy White (Mira Sorvino) and Michele Weinberger (Lisa Kudrow), best friends living in LA who get news of their ten-year high school reunion going on in Tucson. They want to go, but the problem is that they've done nothing with their lives that they're really proud of. Romy has a very mediocre job, while Michele is unemployed altogether, and they don't have boyfriends, let alone husbands. The two begin to reflect on how they were treated by the popular crowd in high school and how hard they tried to fit in, and decide that they'll make up successful life stories to tell to their former classmates at the reunion. But ultimately, they learn that trying to fit in isn't worth masking who they really are.On the surface, ROMY AND MICHELE'S HIGH SCHOOL REUNION is just your average comedy. The story is far from original, and all of the high school-related cliches are present. Even the jokes aren't so funny, although there are some that are very entertaining.What really holds the movie together is the characters and the actors that play them. The characters don't necessarily have so much depth, but the actors manage to make them come alive. Every actor is great and funny in their role, namely the two title roles, Alan Cumming as Sandy Frink, and especially Janeane Garofalo as Heather Mooney. Janeane Garofalo is truly wonderful and adds a darker, more comedic mood to any scene she is. Also mentionable is Camryn Manheim as Toby Walters, and all of the actresses playing the A-group.ROMY AND MICHELE'S HIGH SCHOOL REUNION isn't the best comedy you can find out there. It's highly unoriginal and not very funny per se, but very entertaining nonetheless. The actors make the story come alive and in turn make it a very fun movie to watch. 7/10.

Both having neither a job nor a man, which they deem to be the epitome of success, they set out to find themselves men and respectable jobs to impress those people from high school who tormented so much. They tried so much to fit in while they were in high school, and now are attempting to do the same thing ten years later. Heading out to the reunion they don't have the men or jobs they wanted but making up a convoluted story about how they are famous inventors seems to suit them just fine. On arrival, they are sized up by everyone in the room, especially the girls of the ever-so-popular `A Group'. Of course no one believed them and they felt humiliated, but it was only after this that they realized that they had achieved the success that they wanted. While the `popular girls' gave up their dreams and put on false fronts that they are actually happy the way their lives turned out Romy and Michele were independent from everything they felt ever held them down.	I would definitely see this movie. It's one of those uplifting, fun movies that you can just relax and watch and take away the knowledge that those petty little things that once seemed so important to you, don't matter as much as you thought. For Romy and Michele, and hopefully for the rest of us, true happiness and success is in the eye of the beholder. Do what you want and enjoy it and don't ever look back and regret it!

Romy White (Mira Sorvino) and Michele Weinburger (Lisa Kudrow) are two girls who graduated high school way back in 1987, and their 10 year reunion is coming up. They are happy and excited to go back and spend time with their classmates...even though their only friends were each other and the A group made fun of them all thru school. Even back then, the two girls created their own clothing and patterns, and displayed good fashion sense. Of course the A group, headed by Christie Masters (Julia Campbell) teased and tormented Romy and Michele about everything possible, including their choice of clothing. One A group girl, Lisa, thinks Romy and Michele make pretty cool clothes, but she is silenced by their leader, Christie. Christie is a flat out jerk who makes fun of Romy's slight weight problem and Michele's scoliosis. Romy and Michele remind me so much of my own high school years. I had one very close friend named Henrietta, and we were loners with a few scattered friends outside our tight circle. But honestly, we enjoyed high school because we spent those four years doing things we enjoyed. We didn't design fasions or anything, but we did fun things like rent cheezy horror flicks, go to football games and chase after guys who didn't know we were alive. We had FUN!!! I'd never go back in a time machine to those years, but they were fun. Romy has a crush on Christie's boyfriend Billy (Vincent Ventresca) and Michele has an unwanted suiter in Sandy Frink (Alan Cumming), a total nerd who adores her. Probably the most laugh out loud funny character of all is Heather Mooney (Janeane Garafalo). She is a genius comedienne!!! Other great cast members are Jacob Vargas as Rrrrrramon, Camryn Manheim (adorable) as Toby Walters, and Justin Thereaux as Clarence, the cowboy who tormented Garafalo's character. The two heroines get their revenge at the reunion, and their fashion gifts are finally given the critique they deserve. Christie Masters gets her comeupance too!!!

I had never heard of it, and to be honest, I wasn't too excited about watching it. But as I watched it, I could not keep a straight face. The movie is just flat out hilarious. Even though it was obviously geared just a little more towards the female audience, I, as a guy, thoroughly enjoy this movie. The movie is about two best friends in their late 20's who are a bit slow. One day, they discover that a class reunion is about to be held, and they start to have flashbacks of how miserable (but funny to us) high school was for them. This movie probably holds the record for most flashbacks ever. After deciding that their current lives aren't exciting enough, they fudge their story over the past 10 years a little bit more to show everyone up. Obviously, being a comedy, things go wrong but are eventually made right. It's pretty much a feel-good comedy. You don't have to be in any certain mood to enjoy it, and you really don't have to think. I recommend it to anyone with a sense of humor. I don't know anyone who didn't like it. Heck, it's worth the rental price alone for the scene where Romy (Mira Sorvino) puts on her seatbelt as they get ready for their road trip to Arizona...

The two have got irrational optimism and a blissful trust in one another's friendship. Then they hear about their 10th high school reunion - and proceed to get all bent out of shape trying to make themselves appear more succesful than they are. How they go about it - how they get psyched, humiliate themselves, fight to reconcile, prevail, woo the boys, and triumph while never making any sense on planet Earth - is the rest of this comedy fairy tale, directed with an indulgent hand by TV producer-writer-director David Mirkin (Newhart, The simpsons - a lot of good stuff.) Had 'Romy and Michele' been written by Wendy Wasserstein - at this point our bard of the contemporary American female condition - it would have been called Uncommon High school woman and others and it would have been a much better and tighter story. As it is, this sloppy, pleasant comedy is an amiable mess, a padded out expasnion of a play called 'Ladie's room' mounted nearly a decade ago, starring a then unknown Lisa Kudrow in a showcase role that eventually brought her to 'Mad about you' and 'Friends' doing much the same ditz-as-Zen-mistress character. There are so many good ideas packed into 'Romy and Michele' about friendship, revenge, about the kind of high school torture that never sees the light of day in Grosse Pointe Blank - that it may be uncharitable to yammer. There's a killer interpretive dance the two friends do with Alan Cumming. The music is dishy. So, like, I guess who cares if there's a long draggy fantasy portion in the middle?

It is also one of the funniest I've seen. When I saw the trailer I thought it would be like Dumb and Dumber and Clueless, but it's not!! Romy (Mira Sorvino) and Michele (Lisa Kudrow) play a couple of dumb blondes who were losers in high school and sees their 10-year reunion as an opportunity to make up success stories and get back at the popular and snobby Christy Masters and her friends.I loved the flashbacks, especially the one at the prom where they were both wearing Madonna outfits. I also love the dream, it was odd and made no sense, just like most dreams are!! I especially love the fight Romy and Michele had over who of the two of them was cuter and Michele saying that she was Mary and Romy was Rhoda, Romy replies that's ridiculous you're Rhoda, you're the Jewish one! LOL!! The ending was great, I was literally cheering for Romy and Michele and I don't wanna give the ending away but it's hilarious, especially the dancing part.So in a nutshell, it's not a movie to be taken seriously. It is filled with humor and just a feel-good chick flick that you can watch over and over and over, which is why I bought the video) "},{"Title":"The blonde leading the blonde, eh?

Never have I seen two actresses play such gormless characters.Which is why I loved it to bits. We need films like this in our times of trouble, strife and misery; something to watch and laugh at like a prat. The chemistry between Kudrow and Sorvino is the main laughter source, but everything else also slides perfectly into place around them.The main reason I love this film, on reflection, is that in a peculiar way it lives up to it's own message. By never taking itself remotely seriously, and goofing around at every opportunity (I mean, the dance, come on), it endorses the idea that people should simply be who they are, and not attempt to pretend to be something they aren't simply to obtain the validation of others. (The added sugar of Romy's spectacular revenge just caps it.) This isn't high art, it's not a brilliant piece of film-making, it's certainly not worth 10 out of 10 on a Serious Movie Scale. But on a purely personal level, where it appeals to me and my 26-year-old sensibilities, it ranks as my favourite film.The soundtrack is pure class, and it all makes for a great movie. I score this film 10/10 because I love it so much, not because it's good.

And who doesn't want to go back and impress all the people that made your life miserable back then?  This movie is about that exact feeling, and approaches it from a great angle.  It manages to accurately portray what high school was like for the rest of us, none of that Varsity Blues crap, or the sappy ludicrousness that was Can't Hardly Wait.  The film even manages to make Mira Sorvino and Lisa Kudrow (virtual goddesses) believable as teenaged losers.  Kudrow, though a brilliant actress as proven in The Opposite of Sex and Analyze This, still seems to be playing Phoebe from Friends in this role.  She is still funny, and delightful all around, but Phoebe all the same.  It is Sorvino that reinvents ditz.  She won an Oscar for everyone's favorite hooker, Linda Ash in Mighty Aphrodite, but she chooses a completely different but still ditzy route with Romy White.  Sorvino wields her talent better than her character wields a hairspray can.  It takes a brilliant woman to play a ditz, and an even more brilliant woman to discover facets within the role of the ditz.  Sorvino accomplished just that.  She also has a faking it scene that gives Meg Ryan in When Harry Met Sally a run for its money.  The supporting cast is wonderful as well.  Emmy winner Cameron Manheim appears as the perky, big-boned, well-meaning, and terribly annoying Toby.  Every class had one, and Manheim has it down.  Then there was the most noteworthy supporting cast member, Janeane Garofalo.  This is a quintessential Garofalo role, sarcastic, sardonic, cynical, and downright hilarious.  She utters truisms, most of us have only thought but never dared say.  The movie was great fun, and whoever played Billy is great eye-candy in his high school years.

But they also decide to lie about their careers during the past decade to impress the A-list, who always looked down on them, and made fun of them during high school. What happens before, during and after the reunion is often hilarious, but also touching, as Romy and Michele find out that true friendship is a precious thing, and being yourself is always the best way to live. Mira Sorvino and Lisa Kudrow are outstanding, from their comments on other people and situations, to their facial expressions, to their interactions with the other characters. They bring beautifully to life Robin Schiff's excellent screenplay. Janeane Garofalo deserves special mention as Romy and Michele's bitter classmate, Heather Mooney. The soundtrack of 80s music is fun, and captures the mood of each scene. The clothes worn by Romy and Michele are wonderfully tacky, and the flashbacks to their high school years are funny but also a reminder of the peer pressures and tensions felt by all teenagers. I get a lot of pleasure viewing this movie each time, and Mira Sorvino and Lisa Kudrow are worthy of a big pat on the back for providing two of the most delightful and memorable characters I've seen in a lifetime (over 40 years) of movie watching.

It is brilliant in SO many ways, but first and foremost is because of the delightful, hysterical and touching chemistry between Mira Sorvino and Lisa Kudrow as the unforgettable title characters. Overtly obvious that the two actresses were as close as their characters forces the viewer to become hooked and laugh like crazy at their superb dialogue (eg. Romy, you look SO good with blonde hair and black roots it's like... not even funny!; Don't you just love how we can say that to each other and we know that we're not being conceited? - Ooh, I know.

Janeane Garofalo, who was so good as Abby in The Truth About Cats & Dogs the previous year, is also outstanding as grouchy loner Heather Mooney. It's just a shame she's not in it that much. Although the film is regarded as just a silly comedy, it should be pointed out that there is a strong message to go along with it - be yourself and the hell with what other people think!

I liked the movie, but just think how great it would have been if it had succeeded in tying things together at the end with a bitchin' redemption theme, or some kind of profound character transformation.  Some kind of meta/spiritual awakening type thingie, y'know?  For example, Michelle(?) has this extended prescient dream sequence involving walking into the high school reunion and pulling off the we-invented-postit-notes scam.  All these ideal outcomes are played out on the silver screen of her subconscious mind.  Then she wakes up and; what happens?  She walks into the reunion and has pretty much just another variant on her dream; not quite as ideal, but not terribly distinguishable, either.  I thought that was a little sloppy. I weaned on dream sequences by Bunel and Fellini, so I'm a bit spoilt.Funny story  I'm teaching ESL at a community college, and am presently delivering a reading course, which includes movie viewings.  One of the scheduled movies is this one; the accompanying reading has the theme do clothes make the person?  I was a little reluctant to take on this theme because I wasn't sure I wanted to make these students see the movie; I didn't want to have to explain some of the seedier words and idioms to them.But don't get me wrong; it's got plenty of laughs.

This is most likely the fault of the writing, which is as hit and miss as it gets.  What finally won me over (besides appearances by the always welcome Camryn Manheim and Janeane Garofalo) was the idea that Michele would not dance with Sandy Frink unless Romy could join them.  It was a gesture of true friendship and solidarity, and I was so glad that Sandy would understand and agree.

The difference is that this film actually accomplishes it pretty well, and comes up with far more great humor, something that is probably mostly due to the R-rating(Legally Blond has a different rating, a PG-13, I believe). That doesn't mean that the film is packed with nudity or profanity, though. It does have its share of F-words, and the two main characters(among others) do show a little skin, but nothing serious. Most teens should be able to see this as well, and laugh at it. About the laugh at it, though, I will say that the film requires you to be able to laugh at fairly simple humor. It's not going to make anyone form philosophical ideas about it, nor is it going to impress you in any way, it only tries to entertain, and it succeeds, depending on, of course, whether or not you can laugh at dumb humor. It mostly consists of stereotypes(main stereotype being the dumb blond one), but as long as you can accept that, you should be able to find it fairly amusing. I definitely laughed out loud at a few occasions, and was chuckling at many more. The plot is pretty good, it's about Romy and Michele(as you probably guessed from the title), who, 10 years after high school haven't really gotten anywhere with their lives, and are told about a high school reunion. Fearing they may not impress their former schoolmates, they try to improve their lives. Hilarity ensues. The film has a pretty good, slow, unhurried pace throughout, very much like another teen comedy, American Pie. It doesn't hurry from one scene to the next, but it doesn't bore you either. The acting is pretty good, especially by the two leads, Mira Sorvino and Lisa Kudrow. The supporting cast is also pretty good, especially Janeane Garofalo and Alan Cumming. I very much enjoyed Garofalo's sarcastic character, and her acting was great. The main characters also have great on-screen chemistry, I think. The characters were sufficiently well-written and credible, for a bunch of stereotypes. The soundtrack for this film was also pretty good. The films climax, that takes place at the actual reunion, is packed with pretty much every single reunion-cliche that you can think of, but still manages to entertain. All in all, a good comedy if you can enjoy the fairly simple-minded comedy of it. I recommend it to fans of dumb humor comedies, like Dumb and Dumber, and various other Jim Carrey comedies. Also, fans of dumb-blond jokes might also finds this amusing. 7/10 "},{"Title":"Tries to be funny, but rarely is.","Date":"21 July 2002","Score":"3 out of 6 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy","Review":"  Boy, what a dissapointment all the way.

For some, it's a return to the `glory days;' for others, it can be a masochistic attempt to purge the memories of a past they'd rather forget, but cannot; still others will go seeking vindication and/or retribution for real or imagined injuries suffered at the hands of juvenile miscreants during the formative years.  Then there are those who will go out of simple curiosity (`I wonder what so-and-so looks like now?) or just because it sounds like it might be fun.  And then there are those who would rather have red hot coals pressed into their eye sockets than show up at such a shindig.  Call it different strokes for different folks; but whatever you call it, you're going to meet all of these and more, in `Romy and Michele's High School Reunion,' directed by David Mirkin, a light comedy that indicates that the past may have, indeed, been everything you thought it was, and more-- but that perhaps you just hadn't seen it clearly at the time.  And, upon returning to the scene of the crime, as it were, you discover that ten years of maturing and endlessly revisiting certain school days situations in your mind can do to your perception of it what laser surgery on the eyes can do for a myopic-- for maybe the first time in your life, you can actually see everything crystal clear, and the way it really was back in `The day.'It's been ten years since lifetime friends Romy White (Mira Sorvino) and Michele Weinberger (Lisa Kudrow) graduated from high school, left Small Town, U.S.A. and headed for L.A., where their respective endeavors have at last taken them both to the very top of the minimum wage pay scale.  When the news of their ten-year reunion comes down the pike to them, they're excited and want to go.  Upon reflection, however, it occurs to them that returning to an environment that was less than accepting of them a decade ago, without having accomplished anything more than successfully drawing breath on a daily basis, could possibly be construed as the proverbial fools errand.  They'd just be setting themselves up for the likes of perpetual Prom Queen Christy Masters (Julia Campbell) and her `top of the &#145;in-crowd' cronies (all of whom are sure to be in attendance) to once again come in for the kill.  Not a happy prospect.Romy and Michele, however, have learned a couple of things since high school (and probably no more than that; it's why they're where they are today), and they put their heads together and concoct a plan through which they will finally obtain that which has always eluded them  The cherished esteem of their peers (and most especially, that of  Christy Masters and her cohorts).  And it's so simple-- all they have to do is attend the reunion as a pair of successful businesswomen!  They even come up with the kind of business they're `in,' just on the off-chance someone should ask (what are the chances of that!).  It's a brilliant plan, it's foolproof and it's going to be fun.  And with that, Romy and Michele are off to their high school reunion.Light comedy, like a meal consisting of `lite' ingredients, can be a delicious and satisfying treat for the cinematic palate.  When properly prepared and dished up in just the right proportions, it can be a cause for celebration; and Mirkin's film is just that-- a cause for celebration.  It's well crafted and delivered, works on a number of different levels and will appeal to a wide audience, inasmuch as the subject of the film is one to which most people are going to be able to identify and relate, and on a very personal basis, at that.  Without question, personal experience and individual frame of reference are going to determine how this one is received, and on which level; and it will hinge on which group from among those listed above in paragraph one the viewer falls into.  For some, this film is going to be fun-- taken at face value by the curious who just want a few laughs-- and they won't be disappointed, because this is funny stuff.  For others, however, beyond the surface humor, it may tap into some dark corners of the psyche, revealing things that have been repressed, possibly, but not forgotten.  And regardless to which group the viewer belongs, it will be those with a keen sense of perception that will understand that this is a comedy with some very serious underpinnings.Again, it's the personal experience and frame of reference that will come into play here.  Those of a more superficial bent will see Romy and Michele as prime targets to be set up and used for fun; mere objects of derision held aloft for the merriment of others.  The more astute will recognize the cruelty enacted upon them for just what it is  Cruelty.  And it's a sad fact that for many-- the `real' Romys and Micheles of the world-- the price of the education received in high school was high, indeed  Tuition paid in psychological scars carried-- in too many instances-- throughout the remainder of one's life; scars born of the cruelty meted out by the `perfect' upon those deemed `unworthy' of acceptance in the prevailing social order.  Heavy stuff for a `light' comedy?  Perhaps.  But it's what makes this film so good; it entertains-- Sorvino and Kudrow together?  Forget about it, they're terrific-- but it also makes you think.  And, hopefully, it will encourage the `real' Christy Masters' of the world to pause and reflect upon past deeds and `judgments' handed down in the throes of juvenile self-righteousness.  `Romy and Michele's High School Reunion' is funny-- very funny-- but it also says something that is genuinely worth saying.  7/10.

Indeed the film is so shallow and hollow it's difficult to loathe it as much as I do, but to this day I still long for the 90 minutes and £2.75 I wasted discovering all of the above.Don't get me wrong, I don't mind mindless comedy, either slapstick, spoof or romantic but this is just 42 caret drivel. Don't rent it and if you do - don't come crying to me. I warned ya!

One of these is clearly the bossy type, the others of course do not dislike our main characters so much but want to fit in and play along. Have we seen this before, yes a million times or more. Next we see them -unchanged ???- but 10 years later, thinking of how they will 'do' in the high school reunion. Bore bore. Okay. They make up the story we're business-women who invented the 3m post-its, we'll be so admired, yawn. Loan a neat car and go. Argue about who of them did invent the post-its and split up before they enter the reunion. Then one dreams of how the event goes - o unhappy end, they fight even when they're 80. Pop - wakes up! At the reunion both tell they invented the post-it. A third girl (gets her lover in the end too)spoils the joke by telling who did actually invent it. O you naughty girls lied, oooohhh. Laughing stock. So then they (have to) stick together again, it is not important to be successful, it's about being yourself. And everybody but bossy-bitch now likes them and their cool outfits. @#%@^^@%!!!!!!! And the real turn off is the end. Of course the most successful guy (and still himself of course, NOT) gets the girl, and the two girls become... themselves? Well that too, but above allSUCCESSFUL in their business. And the bad girl is dumped by all.In a nutshell. Seen it, been there done that disliked it... Why do American comedies always pretend to esteem showing your true personality higher than success and without exception end with all 'good' people being successful ???? It is beyond me. Are we 'like' idiots ?Trash instantly. Forget this one. No rent, no watch on telly no nothing. Too bad Pheebs is in it, I like her 'like' sooo in Friends. And Romy is a nice chick allright. But no actress.

There is just one problem they have not done anything in 10 years.  Now they are doing anything and everything to make their ho-hum lives look interesting to all those they hated in high school.  However, they may end up losing each other's friendship during the venture.  Romy and Michele's High School Reunion is definitely funny, but also has a fair amount of drama in it.  This causes the film to be uneven and keeps the film at a fair two-star level.  Sorvino and Kudrow work well together and Janeane Garofalo and Alan Cumming are hilarious in supporting roles.  The screenplay and sub-par direction keeps the film down though.  2.5 out of 5 stars.

I cannot think of a reason why this was ever made or why anyone would want to see it unless to see the leggy actresses. I smiled for a couple of times and ended up with a suspicion that the ending had been changed from some other, original version. As is, the ending was actually better than one could have hoped for (judging from the rest of the movie). (barely a spoiler ahead) In the worst case scenario, there would have been a 'six months later' scene with at least one of the main characters pregnant and married with a rich guy. For the ending alone, I gave this 3/10 and not 2.

I kept expecting something interesting or ironic to happen to these two bimbos who try to pull various schemes to impress people who they went to high school in Tucson with. Nothing really happens except in a really obvious dream sequence. Even the supporting cast with people like Janeane Garofalo and Alan Cumming aren't given anything fun to do. Usually I object to the presence of a pre-fabricated moral but in this case at least it would have given the movie something to hold onto. As it is the movie feels like a joke without a punch line, and it's impossible to judge what kind of values the film is attempting to live up to, even in purely comedic terms.Lisa Kudrow and Mira Sorvino are fun to watch but the appeal of their one-dimensional characters wears off extremely quickly. They do things that are supposed to be amusing and endearing and quirky but that just fall flat or become totally obnoxious &#150; I'm thinking mostly of their vapid assurances to each other that they are on the same wavelength. Vapid characters doesn't necessarily mean a stupid movie (see for example This is Spinal Tap or heck even Wayne's World is a lot smarter than this movie) but in this case the characters are just thrown into one predictable situation after another where they freeze and die. The movie's only momentum comes from the preparations for the journey to the reunion and the journey itself, but this only takes up the first half of the running time. The rest of the time is taken up by the aforementioned lame dream scene and then an equally implausible real sequence which apparently teaches us the lesson that as long as we don't treat other people like complete crap, it's OK to have no aspirations or intelligence because a high-school nerd you used to know will definitely show up to rescue you in his helicopter.It's garbage as far as I could tell, and I always wonder how something like this could even be made. I just assume while I'm watching it that some kind of interesting element will pop up to make the whole thing worthwhile, but from what I could tell it's just a complete waste of time for the audience. It feels like they figured that if they made the characters almost brain-damaged then everyone would feel smart by laughing at them, and then if you throw in a few 80s garbage club tunes people will think it's a masterpiece of nostalgia.

However when they find out about their high school reunion they plan to sort themselves out and return in style.  When this fails they get good suits, borrow a Jaguar and pretend to be successful businesswomen.I watched with some hope of an enjoyable no-brain comedy, I was in that sort of mood.  However I didn't want a no-laugh comedy, which was almost what I got.  The plot is so vacuous it's hardly worth mentioning so I won't.  It barely serves to give us a few comedic setups.  The comedy is a mix of blonde jokes and Phoebe from Friends style jokes.  They aren't very good after the first couple of times and they don't get different or better.Sorvino is OK but I kept wanting to see her other (better) blonde bimbo in Mighty Aphrodite, here she is on auto-pilot.  Also on auto-pilot (but quite good) is Kudrow who just does her best Friends work here.  Cumming is good in support but the film is totally stolen by Garofalo.  She only has 7 or 8 minutes of screen time but she is easily the best character in the film.  Sadly when she isn't onscreen you miss her real bad.Overall this had a few smiles and the odd laugh but the blonde/dumb thing is only one joke and doesn't stand up over 90 minutes.  Watch it for Garofalo's chain smoking, swearing goth and fast forward the rest of this dumb, inane stuff.

It's probably a testament of how to succeed in movie making without really trying. The screen play from Robin Schiff plays as flat as a pancake, with a only a few laughs, more then, than now.Lisa Kudrow was in a TV hit show, and her popularity with some of the viewers might have been why this film was made. Ms. Kudrow's Michelle is a continuation of her television persona. This actress capitalizes on that fact and makes Michele an extension of her other role, Phoebe.Mira Sorvino as Rommy, is totally at a loss. Ms. Sorvino has done better in other films. In here, she has no spark as Rommy, the dumb blonde who decides to lie at her high school reunion, in order to be popular. She is pathetic! One of her best moments is at the diner where they want the business woman special, because they are, business people, you see.The only thing good to be said about the film is the great musical score that we hear in the background. The rest of the cast is totally wasted. Jeanne Garofalo, Alan Cumming, Julia Campbell, Vincent Ventresca, and Caryn Manheim, have nothing to do.A film to be watched with a bunch of former high school friends.
