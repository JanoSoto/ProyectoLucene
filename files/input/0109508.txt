With the movie fresh in my mind I want to put out this message to all the people who have made depreciating statements such as what is Crumb moaning about, he's famous now, the Sixties weren't really like that, it was just two hours of whining, rambling and unjustified complaining etc. etc.  go back to your Kevin Costner, Tom Hanks, Tom Cruise big budget Oscar winners, and stop smearing dirt on one of the best documentaries ever made.  So frigging what if it's shot with a hand - held camera and without studio lighting?  Crumb is the real thing, it does not need any trickery or gloss.  Basically it shows Robert Crumb, the artist famous for Keep On Truckin', Fritz The Cat (though he does not like to be associated with either of them) and Mr. Natural, telling the story of his life through his wife and brothers, with a few scenes of him at a vernissage and a comic book store (etc.) thrown in for good measure.  Call it a modern - day version of the van Gogh - story, or a look at the darker (or even just the non - Warner - Brothers) side of the flower - power generation, the human condition, the power of art, the battle of the sexes, a case history of mental illness, psychotic families, whatever.  The story, and with it the film, is amazing and totally captivating.  I have watched it many times and intend to watch it many times over.  Give it a miss only if you expect some good, clean, family entertainment, but do so at your loss.

Having grown up a bullied, miserable child - and an anachronism almost from the start, with his interests in pop culture ephemera and old-time music - in a dysfunctional family (his father was an overbearing tyrant, his mother an amphetamine addict, his older brother so obsessed with comics that he forces his siblings to draw them), Crumb escaped this drudgery by fleeing to Cleveland, where he first became a staff artist for a greetings card company, then one of their most innovative and prolific designers, before relocating to San Fransisco. His initial impetus was to get some of that free love stuff, but his pen ran away with his thoughts and he wound up virtually launching the underground comics movement. Between 1968 and 1993, Crumb produced some of the funniest, most outrageous, licentious and flat-out brilliant comic book work of all time, and this film is an invaluable insight into the man behind the madness and the mayhem. Turns out Crumb, despite his bizarre appearance (he's stick thin, wears Coke-bottle spectacles and dresses like a character actor from a 1930s comedy) and sexual deviance (he likes nothing more than hefty haunches and big, strong legs in a woman), is something of an everyman - he's married, dotes on his understanding wife and gifted daughter, and feels just as alienated from the 'evils' of modern living as the rest of us sensitive intellectuals! At first glance, of course, Crumb is as weird as they come, but the sight of the aforementioned older brother Charles (a reclusive crank who rarely leaves his squalid bedroom, let alone the house) and younger brother Maxon (a haunted, bedraggled amateur mystic, given to sitting on beds of nails and begging on the street with a wooden bowl) throws the relative sanity of Robert into stark relief. One gets the impression that if Robert had not escaped, he'd have wound up suffering just as much as Charles and Maxon, possibly even more. This isn't easy viewing and the subjects are undeniably resistable, but it does offer a unique and enlightening glimpse into the reality of the old clich√© about genius and madness walking hand-in-hand. Recommended.

The film focuses upon three decades of Crumb's artwork to reconstruct his unhappy childhood, days with Zap Comix in the late 60's, `dark side' period and recent life.  Interviews with him, his wife Aline, family and friends reveal the motives behind his astounding creativity.  Crumb is sometimes hilarious, often depressing and always entertaining &#150; a rare combination in a documentary film.During childhood, Crumb and his brothers Charles and Maxon found solace from their tyrannical father in comic books and drawing cartoons.  Crumb escaped the mental illness that ended both his brother's careers as artists (Charles was equally as talented), but otherwise had a perfectly miserable childhood and adolescence.  Socially awkward, bullied at school and rejected by women, he decided in 1962 (at age 17) to take revenge upon society `by becoming a famous artist'.In 1966, his chemically inspired `revelations of some seamy side of America's subconscious' caught the eye of a Haight Street publisher in San Francisco and Zap Comix was born.  Zap was an outlet for his creative energy, which was rooted in his social difficulties.  He was uninterested in money and once turned down a $100,000 contract &#150; a huge sum of money in those days.  Although identified with the hippie crowd, he could not relate to their culture `My main motivation for drawing was to get some of that free love action'.After a few years of fame, he retired from Zap to express the darker side of his nature.  His later work frequently contained sadistic and violent themes and was sometimes labeled as pornography by friends and critics alike.  Even Crumb isn't sure of his intent `Maybe I should be locked up and my pencils taken away from me'.Critic Robert Hughes says that in Crumb's world there are no heroes and `even the victims are comic' &#150; ideas that don't jive with traditional American culture.  But Crumb has always considered himself to be an outsider and enjoys the feeling of `being very removed or extremely separated from the rest of humanity and the world in general'.  `Words fail me, pictures aren't much better' to describe his disgust with American consumerism.  He now lives in France because its culture is `slightly less evil than the United States'.The film is embarrassingly candid about unhappy details of Crumb's life, such as his brothers' mental illness, experiments with drugs and ambivalent attitudes towards women.  Yet it is apparent that there is no misery or violence in this man &#150; it's all on paper.

As far as this film can make clear, three members of the Crumb family had strong artistic temperaments and significant talent.  Only one, Robert, made it out alive, and his life and work are defined by resistance to what should have been a sad fate.To many, this documentary may be depressing, offensive to women, or just too damn ugly to sit through, but it made me as happy as anything I've ever seen on screen.  Art's ability to reveal truth and promote survival is evident in every frame.  I admire R. Crumb's courage to speak unpopular truths, to draw what gets him off, and to ferret out the art he loves at considerable expense and trouble (he's a blues maven; one of my favorite scenes, where's he's sitting on his floor absorbed by aching music, is echoed in Ghost World, when Enid takes home Seymour's record and gets lost in her favorite song).  And like Ghost World, ratty, real American culture is railed at hilariously another favorite scene involves R. on a park bench, disgustedly commenting on the ugliness of everything around him logo-emblazoned clothes, graceless music, ugly plastic everything.By the end of it all, I respected and liked him Crumb enormously.  I'd take his scary-woman worship over the banal musings of a dime-store philosopher any day. And Terry Zwigoff deserves much praise for being able to pull it off (especially as a first-time filmmaker who had very little idea what he was doing).  From high art and family pathos to a lovely animal appreciation of big round female asses, this is far more a roller-coaster, I laughed/I cried film than most others so touted.

People who didn't know anything about R. Crumb beforehand (like me) can get a look at what drives the stories and characters in his often vulgar artwork and comics. For instance, any of the villains in his work are based on people who made his life a living hell when he was kid. Decades after the fact he still seems to be nurturing those old grudges. At first it seems a bit petty and immature but then we meet his two brothers. They are both talented artists as well but they never learned to express themselves through their works as Robert did. They never found an outlet for their obsessions. Charles became an introvert who hadn't left his mother's house for many years and Maxon developed a fondness for sexual harassing women and sitting on nails. It was probably Robert Crumb's art that enabled him to escape from his own head.All three brothers talk in a very articulate yet somewhat detached manner. You get the sense of love between them, buried beneath decades of pain and emotional repression. When a picture of them as teenagers sitting next to each other on the couch is shown, all of them handsome and apparently very intelligent and artistic, I felt sad and maybe even a little mad. Why were they chosen to be the big victims in life? Poor Charles Crumb never had a chance. Crumb is a great movie that probes the darker corners of human emotions (Bobby Driscoll?!) and a tribute to the usefulness of an artistic mind. **** out of **** "},{"Title":"Sex, drugs and piggyback rides","Date":"4 September 2004","Score":"13 out of 17 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Documentary, Biography, Comedy","Review":"  Robert Crumb became an idol among hippies in the 1960's because of the psychedelic comics he drew at the time. In this excellent film, directed by Terry Zwigoff (who also directed the excellent, and also comic book related, Ghost World and American Splendor) Crumb starts out by telling that he hates just about all the work he is most famous for. This is typical, √ç think, of Crumb he is uncompromisingly politically incorrect, completely unafraid to speak his mind openly, and above all disgusted by the idea of selling out for money.I have been a fan of Crumb ever since I advanced beyond Donald Duck and Marvel Comics about 20 years ago (this is not to say that I don't love Donald or Marvel anymore, because I do). Crumb is probably the most talented comic book artist of the latter half of the 20t Century. Quite simply, I don't think anyone can draw as well as he does. He is not much of a storyteller, but like I pointed out above, that is more than made up by the fact that he is always totally candid about his life, sometimes painfully and embarrassingly so.Crumb is an excellent portrait of an exceptionally talented artist who also happens to be a total pervert. However, as this film makes abundantly clear, Robert Crumb is practically the ideal model of a stable, well-adjusted person when compared to his mother or his brothers Charles and Maxon. We see once again that great suffering makes a great artist.

Once you start watching, you cannot take your eyes away, like watching a train wreck. This is one very strange person, and one is ready to consign him to the loony bin until you meet the rest of the family, whereupon Robert comes up looking like the very picture of sunny sanity. His brothers Max and George are so clearly unbalanced (and mom's wrapping isn't very tightly tied either), and in mental pain, that it is disturbing to listen to their tortured self-analyses; yet, like some sort of horrible natural disaster unfolding before your eyes, you feel compelled to watch. The home in which George lives with his mother is a showcase of squalor. The revelations of their horrible childhoods with a sadistic and bullying father and an amphetamine-crazed mother, are further horrors in this macabre family story. The refusal of the 2 sisters to be interviewed for the story is an omission that speaks loudly, in view of the revelations of the twisted sexual fantasies of all three brothers; one cannot help wondering what the sisters would have had to say. Aside from Crumb's apparent weirdness, right down to his off-the-wall physical appearance and sartorial habits, his comments on American culture - its materialism and its aesthetic barbarism - are dead on. One notes with interest the photography collection Crumb show us of power lines, telephone poles, traffic signals, and the other arcana of the ugly technological background view of our culture - to which we have become inured - which he uses as a reference for his work, because who could imagine such stuff?Robert Crumb - or at least the impression one takes of him from this movie - is an ambiguously enigmatic character, driven by darkly bizarre inner sexual demons, yet with a weird sort of innocence and compelling aesthetic vision that isolates him from American culture. We are not surprised, at the end, when he decamps himself and his family off to a village in southern France. We are also not surprised to learn that George committed suicide shortly after the completion of the project.The movie itself is coldly dispassionate, making no commentary or judgement on these people, but letting everything and everyone speak for himself. The result is a disturbing yet compelling portrait of a troubled artist and the personal and family history that shaped him.

In this great documentary I found that Robert Crumb was telling TRUE stories ins his comics. Which makes him a great story teller as well as an artist that now enjoys accolades from museums around the world. He is one of those very rare people who can be called a MASTER. He also maintains an honesty and a level of integrity that is just not seen these days, the exception being Dave Chapelle when he walked away from $50 million. It also sheds light on his dark childhood and how he turned out to be the normal one. Music plays a vital part in this movie as well. Crumbs passion for mostly blues music from 1936 and before and his premier collection is fascinating. He easily could be considered a music historian. I live in Colorado and will be visiting Roger Ebert today as part of his annual trek to speak about film near the CU campus and hope I can talk to him about his commentary on this updated DVD. You don't have to be a fan of Crumb's to enjoy this film either. His life story is more than enough. For me this movie led me to become the largest collector of Crumb art in the state of Colorado and enjoy an inside circle status. I can't wait for his book of Genisis to come out.

He has been accused of being a racist and a misogynist. This film does much to deal with misconceptions about the artist, but not all the misconceptions are negative.As typical for a documentary like this, there are several artists/critics interviewed about Crumb's work. Invariably, there is some sort of analysis given. Crumb's compared to Brueghel, to Daumier, he's spoken of as a great political satirist.The fact is the first thing discussed in the film is what motivates Crumb's art, what is he trying to express. After a slightly amused, slightly annoyed Jesus! I dunno... he speaks that he doesn't think of his work in conscious terms until _after_ he's drawn it; then he figures out what it's about.This film very subtly points out Crumb is not really anything he's been accused or praised for being. His work is the purest form of his id, his wife, Aline, comments.The film is really his triumph to be himself through a number of horrendous hurdles a brutal father and drug addicted brother; being rejected by women; being tempted to sell out; and legal problems over cartoons. While his two brothers, Charles and Max, both show in differing degrees how their youths were permanently scarred then, Robert Crumb emerges whole, even admirable, in spite of the uncompromising nature of his art. He is unique, his work not easily separable into allegorical meanings or expression of political beliefs.Crumb is a great artist, and he cannot be understood from a few interviews and his art can't reduced into something understandable in clich√©d artistic terms. Zwigoff's film shows Crumb in every way available and tries to express his art similarly. At the end, all we can do is be astonished that the man not only survived but flourished, and marvel at the wide range of what he's produced.Zwigoff's style is so seamless, it doesn't feel like his film, but Crumb's. Of course, it is not Crumb's, but that impression is an indication of Zwigoff's mastery of the form. If his own personality intrudes in the fabric of the film by what he shows and how he orders it, he complements rather than obscures Crumb's genius.The result is unforgettable, not just for its exposition of Crumb, artist and human being, but for the experience of letting Zwigoff's work flow over the film and us.

Although he is the center of the movie, Robert is hardly the only compelling character in the film.  His family, his friends, his admirers, his former girlfriends, his critics, all come through in very sharp focus.  This film could easily have been nothing more than an homage to R.

Yet one comes to understand, through R. Crumb's contrasting interactions with his family, what a curious combination of inner strength and minute perception it is that makes his comic art so accessible to others.  Simple yet mindblowing things, like how he approaches sketches of photographs from a 19th century sanitarium, or his sourcebook with pages of photos of suburban streetlights and electrical substations, give insight into the mechanisms of his genius.

While his personality has tons of odd quirks both troublesome and entertaining, his family demonstrates how far he had to go to escape.

I've heard that Robert Crumb hates this film, but that's typical of him and should in no way influence you not to watch it. (For some people, naturally, that may serve as a motive to see it.) After all, Crumb almost appears as if he hates everyone and everything - except his old jazz/blues music and his daughter. (Then again, I've been often told that I myself hate everything/everywhere/everyone, whereas I know for certain that I only despise 95% of the things I'm accused of hating.) He probably feels uneasy about himself too, so obviously he's going to react negatively to a movie where he appears a lot of the time - and a movie that exposes him. Although, to be fair, there is little Crumb ever hid from his personal life, so in that sense there are no major surprises for the more knowledgeable among his fans.It's utterly irrelevant whether you've heard of Crumb or not, or like/dislike his artwork/comics, or if you even care about comic-books or the visual arts. He is a fascinating and intelligent character, only to be potentially upstaged by his brother Charles, who committed suicide a year(?) after this movie was made. Charles is tragedy personified, a shy luckless misfit who could have had as much artistic success as his brother. There's plenty here to amuse, shock and entertain, a constant barrage of interesting little details about the life of Crumb, his family members, his friends, and the underground scene he was/is a part of. Some of the music Crumb loves is occasionally used as a soundtrack, and this gives the film a distinctive feel. Geeshie Wiley's Last Kind Word Blues, which is played early on, is a terrific example of what true blues sounds like. (Forget Eric Clapton...) Robert Crumb often comes off as totally un-PC, yet sometimes his views may be seen as Leftist (i.e. decidedly PC), but essentially he is a mankind-loathing, intelligent semi-misfit who through his enormous talent and persistence (and a little luck - you always need that) managed to forge a unique career, and avoid ending up perhaps like his brother Charles.

Zwigoff does a wonderful job of setting a mood that allows you to examine an artist who is depraved, perverse and, yet, insightful.Everyone seems to come away from the movie with an idea that Robert is spared the obvious insanity of his two brothers because of his art. But I see it differently(hence the title of this comment). Even Robert admits that his brother, Charles, was a better cartoonist. Another way to view Robert's success and his brothers' descent into crazy is fame. Crumb was an involuntary icon of the 60's. Where would Robert be today if he wasn't recognized and rewarded in the 60's? If Zap comix had turned him away for his misogynist and racist comics, would he have had the subsequent female relationships that seemed to normalize his existence? What would his fantasizing over a high school yearbook and habitual masturbation meant if he was an unknown sharing a room with his brother at Mom's house?When I watch this movie, I am always mindful that Robert's obvious genius would be lost were it not for his luck at being discovered. I suppose that is an obvious statement but, in Crumb's case, fame has managed to gloss over many unacceptable characteristics. And, maybe, that's not such a bad thing.The film lightly touches on Crumb's relationship with his son and daughter. For some reason, Crumb's bumbling attempts at affection with his children were a bit disturbing. Or maybe its just that Crumb's fixation with wrestling and piggyback riding lingers in your mind when he hugs his daughter.On a lighter note, I've noticed that no one has mentioned the soundtrack of this movie. Designed to be in keeping with Robert's love of old American music, the music helps to define the subject. I wonder why Zwigoff made no mention of Crumb's Cheap Suit Serenaders band.Crumb comments against the crass commercialism of America. And, yet, I first saw this movie at a theater in Baltimore where the lobby was chock full of Crumb comic picture cards, mugs, etc.Crumb, the movie, is a crazy world of contradictions and well worth the ride.

The film's epilogue is sad but not altogether surprising, given the clear signals throughout the narrative. A terrific film.

The man is an incredible artist and his works are pure art, even if they are comics. To defend this position, we hear from a British art critic who praises Crumb's work, no matter what the offensive subject matter is. On the other side, we see women - past girlfriends, fellow artists, and others who admit that Crumb is a great illustrator but are extremely wary of the sexist and racist messages Crumb's comics contain. Is Crumb really a sexist and racist or is he commenting on the world? The answer is hard to determine but, after seeing this movie, I think that its both. It's amazing how Crumb, this skinny, ugly, fake-toothed weirdo is so incredibly tapped in to the crazy male id and its sexual desires and racist beliefs.And, at the same time, he's barely able to function in society. He just blends into the crowd and doesn't really understand the world around him. A lot of Crumb's observations on the changing world are used by Terry Zwigoff, who directed this film, in his next movie, Ghost World. That movie is also an adaptation of a comic book so maybe it was there that Crumb's influence was made. Either way, he's the comic book version of John Waters - ahead of his time in grossness, incredibly influential, and not yet surpassed.As for Crumb's family life, the amazing part is that he's the most normal member of his family. His brothers are also great artists but are even worse at functioning in the world. Maybe it's genetics. Maybe it's the torment of being an artist. Seeing Crumb's family humanizes him. Then we see his comics. And we can decide for ourselves if we can separate the artist from the art but, more importantly, we have to decide if we can separate ourselves from the art. Can we laugh at sexism and racism and not be sexists or racists? Does the fact that we find it so offensive mean that we hate sexism and racism or that we are afraid to face our own beliefs (or the beliefs of those close to us)? Bringing out these questions is the greatness of this movie.

Very few films of the 1990s have been universally accepted as masterpieces. Crumb should definitely have been one of the few. On the back of the video's box, it proclaims one of the most critically acclaimed films of all time. It is probably the only film of the decade besides _Schindler's List_ that could have claimed that without stretching the truth. Every critic proclaimed that it was one of the very best films of the year it was released. Gene Siskel put it as his #1 picture for the year (having said in his original review I doubt I'll see a better movie this year), and Roger Ebert put it as his #2 only after _Leaving Las Vegas_ (the only 1990s film I'd put above it myself, too).So why do I claim that it is so great? Well, I particularly think that documentaries are much more important than fiction films if they are done well. The purpose of great art is to study and try to educate us about human nature. Documentaries, since they are fact and not fiction, logically can tell us more about human nature than fiction films, which can tell us about human nature, but they necessarily teach it through the eyes of the artists who created the work. For instance, _Hoop Dreams_, which has been accepted by many already to be a masterpiece, s by far the best sports film ever made. No fiction film could have had more insight into the appeal of sports. Also, it is one of the most important films ever made to deal with racial issues for the same reason.Crumb is the most important film ever made on the subject of the artist. Never has a film had more insight into an artist's work than Crumb does into R. Crumb. Each time I watch it, his artwork becomes more deep and complex. Each drawing becomes extremely multi-layered. R. Crumb was hardly inhibited while Zwigoff was filming him, nor were the other people who were interviewed. Crumb spares none of his personal life. Because of this, we learn more about him than we have ever learned about a single fictional character in film history. Not Charles Foster Kane, not Jake LaMotta, not Travis Bickle. No one. R. Crumb is also extremely anti-capitolistic. I love this! He has inspired me with his thoughts. He never existed as an artist to make money. He has enough to exist happily, but he does not live in a mansion, nor does he own a sports team. He does not own a fleet of vehicles. In fact, he can't even drive!

Crumb's two sisters, however, remain absent from the family's tragic downward spiral--and they don't participate (wisely) in Zwigoff's pet project (The story goes that the director threatened suicide to gain Crumb's full cooperation. Who knows the truth?) Back at the ranch--Crumb does live in the country--the artist's father is dead. His older brother lives in a single room on San Francisco's Skid Row, where he bathes sometimes and sleeps on a bed of nails. He also has dark thoughts about Asian women. Once in a while, he acts on them. His other bother lives with their crazy mother, never works, and reads and collects mountains of old, yellowed and tattered paperbacks. He refuses to read anything new. Everyone is manic depressive. On drugs. And bananas. But somehow Crumb has struck a balance between his art and personal life. He survives nicely with his wife and their daughter in a comfortable ranch house. The dwelling serves dual purposes protection for his massive and priceless blues record collection, and personal solitude from an encroaching outside world. His next step is a permanent move to France! In the end, Crumb, the movie, is a worthwhile odyssey for anyone who wishes to feel better about their own family.

By contrast, his brothers, Charles and Max, are basket cases. They were the children of an active monster (their father) and a passive, colluding monster (their mother). There were two sisters, who declined to participate in this film. As Mad Magazine was of the Fifties, so Zap Comics and Robert Crumb's cartoons and artwork were subversive, anarchic emblems of the psychedelic Sixties, although as the film abundantly details, he himself was never really of that world.After half an hour of this film, we were saying, Wow, how fascinating!

The training film's hypothesis is, what you become as an adult is largely a product of the things you experienced during your formative years, and as an adult only a severe emotional experience could alter any of that. R. Crumb and his two brothers were misfits in school, rejected by girls, and spent their formative years in their shared room, imagining and drawing cartoons. And having sexual fantasies. R. Crumb said by 5 or 6 he became sexually attracted to Bugs Bunny. But he says it in such a 'matter-of-fact' way, and with a smile that you almost accept it as alright. They all became as adults, what they were as kids. One can only wonder if a more well-rounded childhood would have produced different adults.The film itself, which is primarily taped interviews with R. Crumb, his two brothers (two sisters refused to participate), his former wives and girlfriends, and his associates, is a fascinating look at this famous cartoonist. He really is a gifted, self-taught illustrator. When you look at his drawings, and those of his two brothers, you see clearly that what we draw is simply a product of our subconscious. His two brothers were barely functional in 1994 when the filming was done, and one killed himself a year later. But R. Crumb comes across as a fairly normal person, interacting with his young daughter, sharing illustration hints with his grown son. But when Crumb says he has never been in love, never been jealous, and both he and his wife admit to 'fooling around' outside their marriage, it is a wake-up call that these are not mainstream people.R. Crumb is a realist, speaks his mind, doesn't worry about what others think. He admits to his hostility towards women. When a young woman related how fearful she became as a young girl when her brother showed her one of R. Crumb's pornographic comics, he had a genuine concern. No guilt, but concern that 'maybe I shouldn't be allowed to draw my cartoons. Maybe my pens should be taken away. But I have to express myself.' His cartoons are mainly autobiographical. He doesn't drive. He makes fun of the affluent who bought up property near is home, and 'built their dream homes on every hill.' He abhors the commercialism of our society, cannot fathom why people let themselves, for example, become walking advertisements by wearing clothes with commercial insignias or sport teams. In a comic book shop, where some of his stuff is sold, asked for an autograph he said, 'No, I don't believe in that.'As the filming ended, we see Crumb's furniture being loaded up. They moved to Southern France where I suppose they still live. Some art investor paid enough for his old illustration notebooks that he could buy the home in France.

The comics weren't in the best condition, a tear here and there, but they still held up pretty well. Being a slightly big comic book fan at the time (even bigger now) I took a peak at these weird looking comics. Well, I immediately found something special in these comics. Maybe it was the nudity, the drugs or the swears, but I was obsessed with these two comics for quite some time. The two comics were Zap #0 and Mr. Natural #2. I remember on the back of the Zapped comic there was directions on how to smoke a joint or a muggle. Great directions by the way. Ever since I found these two gems, I've become a fan of R. Crumb's work. The first time I saw Crumb the movie, I suppose I was a tad too young to grip what was going on. Thankfully my brother bought me the DVD this past Xmas. I've put if off for a while now, but I put it in last night, and I was immediately brought back to that same type of infatuation with drawing. But something I didn't pick up on the first viewing was all the emotion this documentary delivered. Crumb is a documentary that covers almost all bases of his life. From his tough childhood all the way up to the present as rich and famous artist. If you ever wanted to know who R. Crumb is or how he acts, or what he thinks, this is a must see movie. The film also focuses on Robert's family. Be it his ex-girlfriend, ex-wife or his mother and brothers.

Not since Raging Bull has their been an American film as brutally honest and artful in it's portrayal of its tortured protagonist.  Robert Crumb was a sick cult figure to many; a depraved, perverted, misogynistic and racist comic / pop artist that was one of those once in a lifetime celebrities -- a true original and intriguingly weird character in a world known for weird and original celebrities.  But compared to his horrifyingly screwed up family, Robert Crumb is a COMPLETELY NORMAL person.This is the most revealing documentary movie ever made.  By the end of the movie, you feel as though you know EXACTLY why Robert Crumb grew up to be the way he did, and you actually admire his resilience and his ability to live through the crap he had to go through with a psychotic military father, a mother who was strung out on painkillers throughout much of his childhood, and two brothers who are COMPLETELY crazy (Robert also has two sisters, but they declined to be apart of the film)!  The part that makes this film so unbelievably entertaining and watchable is how interesting and deep all of these characters are, especially Robert's scene stealing older brother Charles, whom is in his 50s and has lived at home with his mother virtually his entire life!  Charles has never had sex and lives among mountains of read books in a house he hasn't really left for any reason at all in twenty-five years, although he also happens to be on an incredible amount of pain-killers and anti-depressant drugs at all moments of his life, so leaving probably wouldn't have been a good idea.  He's so unbelievably insane that he's brilliant.  Charles disconnected theories on life, love, social status, sibling rivalry, and his recollections of the childhood the imaginative Crumb family offspring had are some of the highlights of the film.His other brother Max is also quite compelling.  A self-proclaimed sex-offender, Max lives in a cheap hotel room somewhere in San Francisco, where he begs on the street for money, paints paintings of considerable talent, passes a six-foot nylon strip through his digestive system for cleansing purposes and sits on a bed of nails all day that it is speculated that he made himself.  Crumb's mother, who originally did not want camera crews interviewing Charles, is also quite intriguing.  By the point in time we meet her, we already are aware of her addiction to pain killers throughout her kids lives and her lost, goofy woo, are we really on camera? demeanor is quite funny in a disturbing way.  She also boasts jokingly about such things as beating her children and threatening to give the children enemas if they misbehave.Crumb also brilliantly treats R. Crumb with humility towards his art. Robert Crumb is never displayed as a freak and his artwork is never discussed along the lines that normal comic book art is usually discussed. The movie treats Crumb like a serious artist and social satirist.  Scenes are shown in which Crumb's art is being displayed at galleries as prestigious as the Museum of Modern Art in New York, and the film features expert art-critics as interviewee's, who all uniformly praise Crumb's art and humor (although some do it as though they are in no way endorsing Crumb's strange world view).  There are also many brilliant scene's where we see Crumb doing exactly what he does best drawing.  Many art films focus on the personal lives of the artist more so than the art itself.  While Crumb is a highly personal film, the film largely focuses on his art itself (some of his more infamous drawings and strips are debated and discussed with pro and con viewpoints by various art critics and activists) and how autobiographical a lot of it really is.  Some of the best scenes in the movie show Robert Crumb just sitting down on a bench or at a table somewhere, drawing the people who walk by him.  Crumb focuses in on the most clich√©d details of the people he draws, exaggerating the ad-wear that they wear (Nike, Addias, San Francisco 49ers, etc...), the looks of desperation in the eyes of some of the crowd, to the loudness and crudeness of the sounds coming out of a kid's boom box (in which he quaintly observes that everything coming out of kids stereo's these days sounds like a piercingly loud guy screaming 'cocksucker motherf**ker').Crumb also gives insight into the artist's personal struggles with the female species and the strange misogynistic art it has produced.  Through revealing interviews with ex-girlfriends and his longtime wife Aline, Crumb comes across as a Howard Stern-like 'softy-on-the-inside,' with kinky sexual fantasies.  The alarming difference is that Crumb's childhood was so devoid of love and normalcy that Crumb himself does not have the ability to truly love another human being apart from his young daughter whom he had with Aline (Crumb also has an older son from his first marriage, but they are not quite as close).The one person who does show a lot of love in this movie for its characters and its subject is Terry Zwigoff, the director of this film and one of Robert Crumb's closest personal friends.  Crumb travels into territory that few documentary films are ever aloud by their subjects to travel through.  It is clear throughout the film that the entire Crumb-clan knows Zwigoff quite well from over the years and feels completely comfortable with him, in spite of his camera crew being there -- Charles especially, who romanticizes the camera with his funny tales of teen-angst (of which he seems permanently trapped in, in a disturbing, J.D. Salinger-esque way) and growing up in a strange household.  Robert Crumb himself seems anxious to get it all over with by the end of the film when he and Aline move to France (the film was shot over a period of six years by Zwigoff at a time with both Zwigoff and Crumb were suicidal), but the film has the feeling a lot of times like your watching a group of old friends sitting around reminiscing about the past and catching up on things with each other.  Very few films capture that personal feeling as well as Crumb does, and very few films treat their subjects with such honesty & humility.  The film is a complete labor of love, and it is the best film of the 1990s by a landslide.

And it's full of hilarity and pathos, to be sure.But what remains with me from this film most of all is the running commentary, which in intimate bits and pieces forms the foundation of a thoughtful man's philosophy.  And it's a very human philosophy, from his wry yet tender recollection of homely schoolgirls in the opening scene, to his despair for those poor souls who don't recognize the absurdity of wearing brand logos emblazoned across their chests.It IS an absurd world, that perpetually reveals the possibility of beauty and spiritual connection.  Crumb is an honest man, calling it like he sees it.  And there's love and passion in that deadpan voice, for those that listen.

This will often depend on the merit of the filmmaker, and how personally they connect with the artist and the work itself (some of it is more made for films to show just to get kids to fall asleep in school). Terry Zwigoff, however, is a filmmaker very much in tune with his subjects; his fictional films, the comic-book adaptation Ghost World is cynical (or skeptical) but with true heart, and Bad Santa is as dark as comedies can get. With his friend Robert Crumb he gets one of the most candid, and smooth, documentaries from the 90's. It may mean more to people who are from that period; Crumb is still a legend in the underground comic-book/art scene, not quite breaking into a 'mainstream' but still with his immense cult. But for one from the following generation, I was often mesmerized by his work.A good part of the film is just Zwigoff using his camera to get into the main mind-set of Crumb, not just necessarily with interviews with his family members or friends and co-workers (though there is a lot of that), but also through the presentation of his work, often in medium close-ups, with awesome blues melodies and tunes in the background. Crumb's work is morbid, satirical, drug-inspired, occasionally racist (for a purpose), ultra-sexual (the Fritz the Cat adaptation film of his work was the first X-rated animated feature), and funny in most respects. One particular description by Crumb over a comic of a woman with a headless body being seductive for a main character is very fascinating, as it brings out several different reactions when reading it- laughter at the random-ness of the characters, romantic drama with the man's lusting for this headless woman, and pure odd-ness at what goes on here. You scratch your head in confusion, or maybe have to put it down in disgust, but if you have the stomach for it it's somehow rewarding. If nothing else, the actual form in the ink and use of colors is often miraculous.Then there are the interviews. With Bob Crumb himself he's always in a fairly good mood, very personable around those he loves and admires, and those around him- mostly the women whom have inspired, terrified, and amazed him over the years- and without any shame or shyness about his work. And when it comes to his family they too are just as candid; it's a little depressing, to be sure, to see the state of his brothers (Charles, in particular, who is actually an identifiable character for many outsiders in the world, only to an extreme), and the tales of his father. Some of this goes to explain some things about the psychology of the Crumb mentality, but the fact is Bob Crumb does let it all hang out in his comics, as he admits usually instinctively. There is something about the subject of the artist as a confessional, as someone who is so personal that he can't necessarily projects to a specific 'audience'. It's appropriate, therefore, that a filmmaker like David Lynch produced the film; the similarities are striking in how they both reflect their own desires and hates with the idealized Americana of the 50's.At times 'Crumb' is a little un-settling, but never for the wrong reasons. It's not for the average comic-book fan, and for those who just love and respect artists in general will find much to admire in Crumb's style.

I love a good documentary and this is not merely good; it's a great one, directed by film genius Terry Zwigoff. Crumb the movie riveted me, showing me an intricate portrait of a complex man. This is not a short movie, but I was always engaged--great pacing and editing, surprising and revealing choices of scenes.To me what it says about art (or craft) is far less important than what it says about this one man.Crumb had a childhood that looks worse than the worst horror film I've ever seen. Bad father, bat**** crazy mother, and three genius boys that I suppose may carry the crazy gene too. As Zwigoff takes us into that bizarre home and the lives of the other brothers, we come to see that R. Crumb's art and life is a triumph of the human spirit, a flower blooming out of burbling sewage. To me, it's not an attractive flower, rather a noisome and homely thing, but dang it, a flower, and I ended up applauding him for doing so well with such beginnings.No matter how crazy your family is, you leave this film thinking, wow, thanks Mom and Dad for not being anywhere near this bad. Your own tiny neuroses will seem charming and mild in comparison to the brothers'. You leave the film with the sense that all things are possible--if Crumb did this with his life despite what you now know, what the heck is holding you back?And if a film can change people, even for a short time, this one has the capacity to make you more understanding of the worst people you meet.

What Charles does now is unclear. Presumably nothing. And the other brother, Maxon, is even more bizarre.The constant cynicism is a welcome perspective. He seems happy, but Crumb constantly talks disparagingly of things. His attitude is interesting, and sometimes he suggests a Luddite viewpoint. He also, despite needing money, turned down Saturday Night Live and the Rolling Stones... running from fame.A gallery owner calls him the Daumier of our time and the Time art critic says he is the Brueghel for the second half of the 20th century.

The film never let's your feeling's about Crumb settle or congeal into an easy interpretation, at times he's just a normal guy, others a sex addict, a misogynist, a crotchety old man, an absent and loving father, an abused son, and a younger brother living in the shadow of an even more disturbed older brother. Not to mention the younger Charles who panhandles meditating on a board of nails, or his two sisters who wont speak to him because of his work. Crumb's work is disturbing, funny, grotesque, pornographic, and surreal, and it completely imitates and represents the man and his life, it's not always enjoyable, intelligible, or decent (how does Crumb respond to White-Man arguably his most racist comic, It's about my father I think...., and after watching this, I will give the guy his daddy issues, and take him at his word.) This isn't a good movie, because Crumb is such a great artist, he's a hugely important and prolific figure in the world of comics and graphic arts, but this movie is good, because it's a great documentary, it asks all the right questions, and it's arranged as compellingly as any fiction movie, and it has at it's heart something sadly lacking in many of Crumbs best works, empathy. Terry Zwigoff who would later direct the Dan Clowes comic Ghost World, to similar success, of humanizing the absurd and morose. Even in the parades of his sexual fetishes (R.

Based on interviews with Crumb, his wife, his two brothers (Maxon and Charles), his mom, his son and some other people that know him and also some critics.So the film is based on that in the time when R.

Spoilers ahead! This movie succeeds largely because the documentarian does not inject his bias into the story, nor does he push any sort of agenda. He lets his subjects give their side of the story. He listens to both sides of the argument, whether they approve of what Robert Crumb has done as an artist, or whether he is nothing more than a bizarre pornographer. In all, the neutrality of the movie-maker is this film's best selling point, and I highly recommend this film as one that doesn't beat you over the head with its opinion or message; it lets the subjects do the talking.On the topic of semi-famous underground cartoonist Robert Crumb and his family, the film leaves one with an uneasy feeling at best. Charles, Robert's brother, and his mother reminded me of the recent HBO Grey Gardens movie, which itself was based on a documentary. If Robert Crumb can be perceived by some as a stark eccentric who cannot fit in to modern society, at least he has been able to create a stable home life with a loving family of his own. This movie is utterly tragic in its portrayal of Crumb's brothers, Charles and Maxon, especially so since Charles is gifted with exceptional cartooning skills (his artwork looked superior to Robert's best efforts), yet was cursed with severe psychiatric problems which prevented him from entering society as a functional individual. While Robert is a functional member of society, the overall impression the movie gave was that he was somewhat distant from other people, including his kin, and could not pick up easily on the feelings of others. The most poignant example of this was a brief (maybe one minute?) description of his father by Crumb's son from his first wife. Still, it was delightful to see Crumb nurture his children by helping them do artwork of their own.On the surface, Crumb may seem like a unique if peculiar individual snobbish, detached from the outside world, relishing in dressing in anachronistic clothing and listening to old jazz records. Still, the impression was of a kind-hearted individual who found release through art. I did enjoy the movie's inclusion of those who objected to Crumb's art as blatantly pornographic, though my sense is that Crumb's work does not have the mainstream popularity which would make it troubling to society at large, nor the messages in his illustrations singularly sexual, to classify it as straightforwardly pornographic.A solid effort.

But the classics are stylized accounts with kernels of truth. Crumb, in contrast, is truth through and through uncompromisingly laid open. You don't realize how rare truth is until you finally see it.Crumb's own oeuvre is a study in truth, inhabited by a menagerie of characters that haunt his subconscious rigid White Man, farcical hippie guru Mr. Natural, Amazonian Angel McSpade, the subhumans who beat up his brother as adolescents, and his own self-pitying self.When he became a counter culture hero, Crumb promptly put the would-be worshipers at arm's length with his openly perverse sexual comics. He lampooned America and its critics alike, though lampoon isn't quite the right word, for his powerful critiques are frequently wordless, midnight black humor, if it's humor at all (see, for example, his History of America at www.zubeworld.com/crumbmuseum/history1.html). He drew what he felt and never sold-out, even turning down a commission to draw a Rolling Stones album cover because he didn't think much of their music. During the filming of the movie, he and his wife are moving to the south of France because America has become just too ugly, commercial and crass.Interviewed in the film, he and his brothers acknowledge being unpopular wimps, abused by their father and many of their peers. Underlying the truth in his work lay the truth of his life and family, exposed with embarrassing candor. His older brother and mother never leave their small, poor home, though they have nothing in common so they just maintain an uneasy truce. His younger brother lives as a monk, drawing a long linen tape through his body to clean his intestines while sitting on a bed of nails. Neither brother has ever had sex.Crumb, it's clear, loves them, and it's a painful, poignant love because he's also detached. What can he do after all, except accept them? His work too, is poignantly portrayed at one point he sits semi-autistic listening to soulful old records (he's a collector), with a slow panning over a collage of haunting illustrations.Crumb is routinely referred to as a pervert. And of course his family is deeply disturbed. But so is much of America. And so is much of the world. Psychiatrist Alfred Adler observed that The only normal people are the ones you don't know very well. So of course Crumb is not normal. He has allowed us to know him.

Terry Zwigoff's documentary examines a man behind his works, his tastes, hobbies, and phobias and the forces that have contributed to producing a very original and controversial art.Director Terry Zwigoff spent six years in making the portrait of an Artist as seen by Crumb himself, his spouses, ex-girlfriends, his son Jesse, various artists and art critics, and the members of his family. Speaking of the strange and dysfunctional families, Grumb clan could definitely take a prize. Of three brothers, only Robert Crumb was able to come through his upbringing with his sanity, talent, and ability to create and to communicate still intact but at the same time, he is a man with many inner demons, sexual and psychological that he reveals and fights through his art. His two brothers, Max who is a confessed sex-offender and Charles who had lived all his life in his mother's house and would commit suicide one year after he gave the interviews for the film, were both gifted artists themselves but they could not leave their childhood memories of a father, an overbearing tyrant and sadistic bully, and a mother who became an amphetamine addict behind them and to move on with their lives. The interviews with Charles and Max are devastating, shocking, and very sad. It would be interesting to listen to their two sisters but they refused to talk in front of camera for the film. The most fascinating aspect of the film is the fact that a viewer does not have to be a comic book fan or have knowledge of the counterculture or the specific cartoon characters to appreciate and admire it. I am not a comic books expert or fan. I've heard of Crumb before but only in regards to the films that also have impressed me a lot, Ghost World and American Splendor. It did not stop me from realizing that the documentary about Robert Crumb, his life, his works, his struggle, his anger, his obsession with sex, his non-conformism, non-sentimentality, his rejection to do mainstream even it means saying No to making a lot of money, and his ability to look at the circumstances and deal with them with a dry humor is an amazing document which provides a thought-provoking character study and the deep psychological insight in the creative mind of an artist.

Shelton, however, was almost always portraying head humour Crumb had a dark side.R. Crumb's drawn-from-life yet cartoonish women were always legs-and-bum for you Americans, legs-and-fanny. The inclusion, in this film, of comments by feminists juxtaposed with same by his ex-lovers, is perhaps more indicative of the American psyche, and its reluctance/need to embrace fetishism, than it is of a feminist need to expose Crumb as a proto-rapist a portrayer of porn.The need for satire, whether for political reasons or no, is what makes cartooning an incredible source of fun indeed, a source of what makes us human in the first place. Thus Robert Crumb.However, this doco indicates just how awful life can be when all your family is (apparently) clinically insane.

I can only take so much of anybody's whiny self-indulgence (what his brother Charles refers to as an excess of narcissism), even if he IS a genius, which R. Crumb clearly is.  At least he says it all with a smile and a shrug, having gained some perspective over the years.  Still, his genius is artistic, and is limited to his artistry.  Many of his statements are expressed in sweeping, categorical statements that reflect a nostalgia for an ideal bygone era which Crumb himself -- in his demythologizing of the Ozzie 'n' Harriett '50s -- denies ever existed.There's a chilling sequence in Crumb that lingers in mind.  Robert is show-and-telling us one of Charles's last (early '60s) homemade comic books, one of a series titled Arcade and featuring stories derived from the Disney film version of Treasure Island.  As Robert turns through the pencil-drawn pages, there comes a point where the text takes over  the word balloons become bigger and busier, the characters reduced to tiny talking heads.  Next the characters disappear completely, giving way to page after page of nothing but words carefully rendered in tiny hand printing -- which then segues into notebook after notebook of unintelligible scribbling.  By that point, the nervous laughter of the audience had given way to an awestruck, sinking silence.  It reminded me of the All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy scene in The Shining, with the obvious exception that it was true -- a genuine glimpse into the abyss.Seeing Crumb made me want to read some of his comics again, but I wouldn't be interested in seeing the movie a second time.

The film strikes a nice balance between interviews and montages of Crumb's work; a lot of time is spent on the camera gliding over the inventive images that Crumb generated over the years. His images are provocative and Zwigoff again strikes a great balance between interviewing those who hate his work (believing it sexist, racist and worse) and those who think he is misunderstood. Crumb himself gives sadly little insight into the rhyme and reason behind his work. Early on, he claims to never work with conscious messages and later on he admits to having no idea where the inspiration came for a fake advert. Crumb's brothers are also interviewed, and while Robert is the famous one, it is Charles and Maxon who are the most intriguing. Both seem disturbed, whereas Robert is actually well-adjusted and happily married with a doting preteen daughter (though his choice to make her watch 'Goodfellas' is odd). It is hard not to wonder how different the film may have been with Charles and Maxon more in focus. Charles was in fact an accomplished artist himself but unable to ever restrain himself, while Maxon has some perversions, almost as odd as those seen in Robert's comics. 'Crumb' is an interesting documentary either way and even if one finds some of Robert's images offensive, there is no denying the artistry and imagination required to come up with such bizarre concoctions.

The movie is a honest depiction of Crumb in the sense that he (and people around him) openly talk about his strange (and sometimes scary) sides - but the movie never gets personal for him. Only for his brothers.That said, the documentary does not point to his brothers and say This is the explanation for Crumb's art. It does not simplify his art, even though some of the people commenting on it in the documentary are clearly trying to. It takes you on a journey through the themes of his art in a way that feels fluid, but that is really done point for point.And that is why this documentary work so well.

The notoriously reclusive Crumb, who self-proclaims that he doesn't like to interact with people he isn't completely comfortable with, would normally be a near- impossible target for any self-respecting documentary film-maker to get even an interview out of. But life-long friend Terry Zwigoff, who reportedly threatened to kill himself if Crumb wouldn't allow him to film him, achieves an immaculately intimate portrayal of what drives the man, and how this strange and often extremely dark-humoured man came to be.Born in 1943 and growing up closely with his brother Charles and Maxon (he also has two sisters who declined to be interviewed), the brother's developed an early fascination with comic-books, mainly thanks to Charles' obsession with the medium. Living with a tyrannical father who often beat them, the three boys grew up extremely damaged and socially inept. Charles was good-looking but, as he describes, there was just something wrong about me,, but Robert would use these experiences as amusing pieces in his sketches. As he got older, Robert wrote for Zap! Comics, and was one of the front-runners in the underground comic-book scene, where he developed the Keep on Truckin' serial, as well as his most famous characters Mr. Natural and Fritz the Cat.Given what seems like unprecedented access to Crumb, Zwigoff doesn't bombard the film with archive footage or talking head interviews (though there is a bit of the latter), he instead allows the story to be told by Crumb interacting with his family and friends, who all seem to regard the man with a lot of love, regardless as to how damaging he has been to their lives. We meet his two brothers - Charles still lives at home with his mother in a room piled high with literature, discussing his inability to get an erection due to the vast amounts of medication he has been given, and Maxon, having recently discovered his own artistic potential, is compelled to sit publicly on a bed of nails and pass linen through his body to cleanse his intestines. This isn't your typical all- American family.Which makes it interesting is that the idea of a husband happily greeting his wife and kids after a hard day's work to sit down to a wholesome dinner in middle-class suburbia, became one of the focal points of Crumb's work. It is something that obviously appals and amuses him, this idea of 1950's all-American perfection where consumerism took centre-stage and capitalism reared it's ugly head. He frequently refers back to a simpler time, where America lay relatively untouched, when people's problems were real and poured their souls into the blues songs he so obsessively loves and collects. His piece A Brief History of America, where a peaceful and green bit of land slowly gets taken apart and replaced by all manners of ugly wires, pylon's and advertising boards, shown here in the film, is especially powerful.Zwigoff isn't afraid to show the dark and ugly side of Crumb either. Shown sketching random passers-by on the street, he formidably judges and satirises them without uttering a word to them. This is a man whose opinion of humanity is nigh-on misanthropy, voicing his disgust at the brands and slogans people feel compelled to wear. His work also went places that most people would leave untouched, such as N****r Hearts, where a perfect, all-white family sit down to a dinner of African- American organs, or the sketch in which a man and his friend rape a woman with no head (later revealed to have been simply pushed down within her). He's certainly a troubled man, but all great geniuses are, or at least should be, and Crumb the film lays it out on the table.

Robert Crumb is the cartoonist and artist who drew and created popular comics and images such as Fritz the Cat, Mr. Natural and Keep on Truckin', he was the major pioneer for the genesis and popularisation of underground comics. This documentary details his life from developing his talent for drawing and making his own comic books with his two brothers, and of course becoming famous, but we also get an insight into the darker and strange regions of his subconscious mind. Interviews come from Crumb himself, his mother, his two brothers Charles and Maxon who are perhaps more strange than Robert, his then wife Aline Kominsky who knows her husband is unusual and his ex- girlfriends, as well as other artists, art critics and historians, and some admirers. The work of Crumb started from childhood with his love for Disney and various cartoon characters, where he and his brothers would create their own adventure comic books, and growing up he developed his bizarre style which included satire and sexual and perverted imagery. It is interesting to hear his various stories about his creations, his relationships with his brothers, his parents and the women he was with, it is interesting to see how disturbed his brothers are (one committed suicide after the film), and it is interesting to see his works discussed, including the mentioning of killing off Fritz the Cat following the cartoon film which he did not approve. This has many elements to it, it is fascinating, it is artistic, it is strange and it is disturbing, Crumb is obviously a genius with his cartoon style and imagination, but his eccentric personality and family background is the most interesting thing to watch this for, a most worthwhile documentary film.

Crumb's art and career are celebrated here on film even while his dysfunctional adolescence, his personal insecurities and his sexual obsessions are dissected by family, friends, pop psychologists and other invited crackpots. We see how, by his own understanding, that young Robert Crumb developed his talent as a vehicle to reach out and connect with other people, especially girls, and then had to deal with the frustrations resulting from his failure to achieve success with this. We see how his cartooning style evolved, how certain repeated subjects and motifs found their way into his work.We get a close up view of Robert Crumb that is almost too close up. The film's intimacy with its subject creates an almost claustrophobic feel, especially since Crumb himself is almost painfully awkward and lacking in personal charm, his mother is an ogress, his wife and daughter seem wary and stiff on camera, and his older brother is borderline crazy.Especially interesting is Robert Crumb's brother Charles, who is also a cartoonist and quite talented but clearly mentally unbalanced. His work shows genuine technical polish and is extremely evocative. It is also morbid and obsessive to the point of wallowing in darkness and despair, since its creator is an over-40, out of work dingbat who lives and works in the attic of the Crumb family home. Charles was a key inspiration to the young Robert Crumb, yet he is also an object lesson.

Crumb just claims that all this stuff is inside him and needs to come out through his pencil. I actually admire this kind of truthful approach. Filmmakers Martin Scorsese and Federico Fellini come to mind as two others who put a lot of themselves in their work, although they do it on film and not paper. Robert Crumb became popular in the 60's for his psychedelic comics of the time including ZAP comics, one of his most popular. He has two brothers, Charles and Maxon who can also draw well but have had no real success with it. It's hard to believe but seeing these two brothers makes you actually realize that Robert was the normal one in the family! Definitely a scary thought. Has success gone to Robert's head? The answer is no. He consistently turns down offers from Hollywood that would make him very rich. Although I admire things about him, I found him kind of a jerk from how he treated other people. One instance is when someone says they love his work and would like an autograph and Crumb wouldn't even look at him and basically just let out his usual defensive laugh. What is curious though is that his wife, son and daughter seem almost well adjusted. Interesting.

His irreverent satirical cartoons exploded from an era which included the Viet Nam war, to thrust him to worldwide status, but even those who grew up during those disturbing times, had no idea who he was personally, or how he came to draw as he did.  An icon of his generation, he was almost anything but its product.As the documentary opens, Crumb has turned a bit grey and his best days are behind him.  But he is doing okay, living leisurely within his means.  He is not uncomfortable letting us know about his background from a dysfunctional family, or sharing with us the tragic conditions of his brothers and mother.  It is all a part of who he is, and how he became.  Cartooning was both his passion and his way to survive.  He credits one of his brothers with inspiring him to cartoon, although both of them became increasingly insane.  That he was able to escape that dark world he credits to luck and his art.As a story, and not just a biography, the view of humanity exposed resonates with any kid who didn't fit in, and whose genius stood outside the gates, tartly observing the scene, like a tourist, with his brilliantly absurd satirical cartoons on the sleaziness of popular culture.  At the same time there is a deeply moving poignancy to his story, mixing an introverted burlesque and near madness with sadness for humanity.  His life emerges out of controversy.  Some find marvelousness in his work, while others see only indecency.  To him, it is a working out of contradictions in his mind.  To the extent that much of it is shocking, it is the American popular culture that is so ludicrously pornographic, for which Crumb could only exaggerate the obvious.

In the intervening years, documentaries such as The Kid Stays In The Picture, American Splendor, and Mayor Of The Sunset Strip have used narrative and filmic techniques that make Crumb seem downright quaint and formulaic, by comparison. From the technique of highlighting the bizarre and uninteresting people that inhabit mumbling cartoonist Robert Crumb's life, to having statically placed talking head experts- such as Femininazi journalist Peggy Orenstein and Deirdre English, a former editor of Mother Jones magazine, who decry Crumb's alleged misogyny and racism, to egghead elitists like Time magazine art critic Robert Hughes who ridiculously masturbate over the most inane and puerile of Crumb's work, to ending the film with a text-laden write-up of what happened after the cameras stopped rolling, Crumb seems to be a relic from another age; which is ironic since many in the film seem to already- by then, associate him with the bygone psychedelia of the 1960s. But that's what it is- a pre-Internet ideal of the classic Junior High School approach to its subject matter. Its only deviance from formula is the deviance of its subject&#133;. The actual film is not bad, merely adequate, which given its hype, is quite disappointing. In rewatching the film, too, there just seemed to be many moments where things were staged for effect, such as when Crumb is confronted in a coffee shop by a young female who objects to his work, and weakly defends himself by stating, 'not everything is for everyone,' or when Orenstein and English pontificate against Crumb, only demonstrating their stolidity, while Hughes bloviates in his defense over minutia that Crumb does not even buy. That anyone with an intellect can take such lowbrow and transitory work with such seriousness says far more about the decline in art and critical thought than anything satirical or lampooning from Crumb's pen. Robert Crumb may be a great comic book illustrator, but he is not a great artist, for technically his work never rises to a visual sense that moves nor provokes the deepest and highest ideas and ideals, and there is no profound message, nor joy, to his work. In short, it and this film are not nearly as great as its hagiographers claim- which seems about right, for that is just like the man himself.

I say yet, because he is  A persona that would not have been allowed to flourish in France, or anywhere that doesn't have the US' counter culture history.Check his brother too.... not a Mad Yogi but a real Yogi as far as I can check it. His brother mediates on bed of nails , has begging bowl etc . He needs this discipline as it checked his sexual harrassment habits! A True Yogi,I say,   a superfreak who can't get it on so masks it with Yoga as he can't find a nice spot to release and relieve himself..ha ha, while you and I are lucky enough to get nasty in other countries.Pity we were not lucky enough to be born earlier when creative outcasts like Crumb really could for a moment make a living out of their outbursts without a friggin PR Marketing Yuppy coaching you.The movie ends with precisely that, some tosser Hollywood Ho hassling Crumb for 'cartoon rights' on the phone....pause... hey maybe the guys is doing the right thing leaving US for France. What About Us Bro? Looking at this documentary is real history, that time has gone where does the 'hurt, sensitive, guy who doesn't fit in' go? where are our spaces and outlets. My old mates back home are all recluse with NO FUN. Crumb has fun, Crumb had fun ... jerking off to his own cartoons, riding big ass ladies. We gotta come up with a plan and use this documentary as a starting point.

It was about one fourth of a good movie, but that was during the begining, and it didn't last long. That good part was a brief bio on how the title character began writing his comics, his struggles to fame, the controversy, and competition that he faced. We're also forced to sympathize with him when his comic, Fritz the Cat was turned into a full length movie without permission. But the movie turned into a borefest when we're introduced to his family, who have absolutely nothing to do with his comics (According to his reasoning, it was influenced by the fact he was a loner in high school). The dysfunctional aspect of his family just wasn't sympathetic, it was uninteresting, and I can't buy the fact it was what made him who he is.(Compared to some broken families, this group of people are perfectly normal.) Thus the whining was unjustified. He's famous. What does he have to worry about? Interesting to note that the real life R. Crumb found this movie misleading! Only see it if you think watching paint dry is entertaining.

There's a lot of admiration for Crumb's wondrous talent and fertile imagination and the film makes a case for subjective appraisals of his work. (To be fair, though, Zwigoff often presents his subject from perspectives that are not always complimentary, primarily through critics outraged by Crumb's perceived misogyny.) But the film seems a little long in the tooth and the primary subject himself often seems so slight that he barely justifies a feature-length examination. Crumb himself simply slithers through the film, constantly smiling falsely and frequently obscuring himself and his cranky insights--he grows tiresome pretty quickly and his protestations about not being a worthy subject proves dismayingly true.  "},{"Title":"Odd Character Study","Date":"15 January 2001","Score":"0 out of 5 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Documentary, Biography, Comedy","Review":"  Crumb consists of a series of interviews with or about Robert Crumb, probably the most famous of the underground comics artists of the 60s. Mostly it's Robert doing the talking, although much time is spent with his older and younger brothers. If you are a fan of Crumb's as I am, this movie provides insight into what makes the man tick. It provides glimpses into the persona who created Angelfood McSpade, Mr. Natural, and Fritz the Cat. It's not all pleasant, especially when it is Robert's older brother doing the talking. If you don't give a hoot about underground comics from the 60s and don't care to know anything about R Crumb, this movie could be a real drag. It really will depend on what you want out of it. My college-age daughter who was expected a tutorial on hippies and their literature was disappointed.

I am a comic collector of 27 years now (as of the year 2000), but I found myself skipping chapters and fast forwarding after chapter 15 of the DVD.  The whole story is just boring.  It's obvious that Crumb and his family are disfunctional, but it's not what I'd consider interesting.  There are a couple of interesting tidbits, but to *everyone* except true Crumb fans, this documentary will bore you to tears.  I'd avoid at all costs.  I rated it a 2 of 10.

Another one of those movies where the release had a positive impact on critics but no real benefit to the audience. In other words, a disappointment. And just because a film is about someone's life does not make it necessarily good.What was wrong with Terry Zwigoff's Crumb? About one hour in, the film delivered a taste of biographical brilliance. But what really ruined it was how the documentation turned into a barrage of rambling and self concerned babble. Imagine a camera focusing on a group of doctors, talking, laughing, and gabbing about something you couldn't care less about. What's more, this goes on for 30 minutes, it's in one room, and you can't understand what they're saying. That's exactly what Crumb was like. If you like to see that in a movie, I recommend Crumb to you very much. For anyone else, skipping the flick would be a smart move.Woodstock, Monterey Pop and Roger & Me were all excellent documentary films. Not because they were made by well known directors, but because they focused on something either historical or interesting. Crumb, whose character, real life Robert Crumb, was not very sympathetic, did not need to be in order to make it interesting. However, Crumb was not. Dismal, bland, boring,  and insipid, Crumb is recommended for those who think all independent films should be good.

The critics have got to be joking.  The only points of interest are those segments where the film displays Crumb's drawings, and possibly a few prurient details of Crumb's life and longings (if you go for that sort of thing).  Otherwise, this freak show gets boring fast.

This film achieved none of these objectives.  I suppose CRUMB was supposed to fill objective number three &#150; and be thought provoking.  The only thought I had is `Why the hell am I wasting my time watching this `genius'?  If R Crumb is a genius, well -- as he annoyingly starts most of his thoughts throughout the entire film -- `ya know&#133;..' we have seriously lowered the bar.  How many times can a grown man say `YA KNOW?'   GOOD GOD!   I was hoping for a nuclear attack while I watched this wretched film.  How people who are such losers could be interpreted as entertaining is beyond me.  I hated every single solitary second of this film.  Crumb is a monotone self-indulgent mess, and I am talking both of the film and the person.  Seldom have I seen a film with more unlikable people.  Charles should have killed himself years earlier and spared himself a life like that.  He probably committed suicide after screening an advance copy of this film.  Every time Crumb giggles, I just want to smack him.  Every time he spoke, I cringed and wished I were deaf.  Every time I saw one of his Shi**y comics, I wished I were blind.  Only David Lynch could have made this film. Only David Lynch would have WANTED to make this film. This film SUCKS.  I hated, hated, hated, hated, hated this film.  It should be shown only at lobotomy conventions.  My version of hell is being strapped to a chair, having my eyes forced open with toothpicks and being forced to watch a never-ending double feature of CRUMB and ERASERHEAD.   David Lynch is the Devil.

We also spend time with ugly Crumb's brothers, Max (epileptic, women molester who lives in San Francisco) and frustrated Charles. Yeah, we get it, Crumb's home was a deliriously freak circus. Zwigoff introduces us to Crumb in his sanctum sanctorum, the small studio behind his house in Winters, California, but there's one thing Zwigoff doesn't tell us, however, and that's why Crumb has become such a famous cult figure. Though most reviews have so far been positive, Crumb was attacked by some critics as Andrew Sarris in the New York Observer, for its notorious sexism present in his artwork. In the film, Crumb says that around the age of 17 he wanted to succeed in art as an act of revenge against all the school girls and bullies who abused him. Now he lives in France while ironically U.S. market is full of his nasty figurines. "}]
