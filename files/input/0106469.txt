It simply tells a story that faithfully paraphrases harsh reality. If you don't get the story, then it's easy to lambaste the acting and directing. If you do get the story, then the acting and directing are good enough.Many of the film's characters are people we know Cruz, full of verve and potential, a victim of the needle; his father, a working class Chicano who wanted better for his sons; Miklo, the fresh-faced well-intentioned misfit driven inexorably to a life of brutality; Paco, the handsome athlete rescued from ruin by the Marine Corp; Juanito, the mocoso of the family, whom everybody wanted to protect from the perils of the barrio, tragically cut down nonetheless; Miklo's mom, a party girl ill-prepared to be a mother; Miklo's aunt - strong and responsible - called on to be a mother to her sister's son.The prison scenes and subplot are quite visceral. Some people find them laughable or unbelievable, but I find them to be neither. Some liberties were taken, but for the most part, I thought prison gangs, corruption, killings, rape, parole boards, and trade were depicted quite well.There are also universal themes The meanings of home and family; hard but honest work versus a life of crime; the fickle consequences of youthful foolishness, striking down some while letting others pass; unfulfilled hopes, and other hopes fulfilled in unexpected ways; a family torn apart by tragedy with only time to heal the wound; the struggle to right one's ship; generational gaps bridged only by maturity that comes in the wake of mistakes; the constant questioning of oneself.It would have been nice to see more character development of women in the family, and some of the actors should have worked on their accents and delivery a little more. Still, I highly recommend this film to anybody in search of a story like the one it tells. To those who don't feel particularly strongly about the material covered, I'd say BBH is no worse than almost any recent big budget film. But to those inclined to greet the *underlying story* with folded arms and a dismissive grin or snort, I'd say spend your three hours watching something else. My verdict 9 of 10 stars.Now I'll address some points raised by those who say the film is garbage.1) It was too long. It was long, yes, but there's very little I'd have left on the editing room floor. I think if one finds the subject material interesting, then the film moves along nicely, despite its length. Also, I think it's hilarious that so many people who despise the film actually watched the whole darn thing! Any flick that keeps you watching for 3 hours can't be too bad.2) Damian Chapa is too white to play a Latino. First, people who say this misunderstand what it means to be Latino, and second, they miss an important subplot. Chapa is a *Spanish* surname, and if Damian Chapa is Latino, then by definition, he's not too white to play one. Latinos of mixed ethnicity are not some Hollywood phantasm, and the treatment of mixed ethnicity and Americanization is a recurring theme in Latino culture in the USA. In the film, Chapa's character is of mixed ethnicity, and as such constantly has to prove he is Raza in a way that his peers never do. This constant challenge to his identity makes him fearless and quick to the draw, lest those whose approval he seeks question the make of his blood. For example, that's why *he* is the one to first confront Tres Puntos, not his fellow Vatos Locos. In a culture where fair hair, skin, and eyes are at times a liability, he proved his worth by the only measure his peers valued.3) The acting was over the top. Some of the acting that seems over the top is actually not. Gang members quickly learn to communicate by force of will. Also, they are not generally educated or refined, and in their own parlance, one word can mean many things. So the frequent displays of machismo are not necessarily bad acting, and hearing ese and carnal repeated over and over is not necessarily bad directing, and the convicts' corny one-liners are not meant to be the witty banter of NPR... but yeah, the film could have been toned down a little in some places.4) It wasn't true to the time period. Critics said the same thing about Doctor Zhivago, but a good film transcends that, and I believe BBH does. The film covered from ~1970 to ~1985, and I had no problem with the settings. Whatever time period mistakes were made weren't bad enough to distract me from the film.5) BBH is a cheap rip-off of American Me (AM). I saw BBH before I saw AM, so I wasn't predisposed to dismiss BBH as a knockoff. I think AM is depressing and clinical, whereas BBH is uplifting and colorful. Both films cover the same reality and so of course will overlap at points. The same can be said of films about the Vietnam War or the Old West, except that because there are relatively few films about Latinos, the comparison of these two is inevitable. AM is more polished, but BBH is more riveting, probably because BBH makes you care about its characters more. If AM is a sad docudrama with all the loose ends tied up, then BBH is an emotional roller coaster with many questions unanswerable and others simply left unanswered.

What a travesty for a start that it had not made a bigger mark at the box office and had been consigned to a cheap basket! I'm sure if released with more fanfare this time it would reach the audience it deserves! It is a story of rival gangs, family, love, betrayal, loyalty, acceptance - every film clich√© you could think of.It thoroughly explores the destiny of its 3 young stars as they struggle to make their way with the life path they have taken. I won't give away the plot as I believe anyway who truly loves films should see this film in its full glory with no knowledge of the plot or how the film eventually plays out.I have been reading the postings, and many negative comments have been made about this film, but I believe this film stands up to much of its unfair criticism.I will admit though, that I did squirm at some of Miklo's earlier expressions in the film, but a 3/4 of the way through he really picks up the baton and completely takes over. In fact, he is a revelation.There are some cheesy bits of dialogue, but I don't think this takes away from the piece in any way.It is a long film, but it needed to be. I don't think there are ANY scenes they could have done without - it is very effective, just the way it is.Anybody who has seen it and didn't like it first time round, I employ you to rent it/buy it again and give it another try.I purchased another copy of it again just a few days ago.

It's an interesting story, though generally, it perpetuates the East L.A. gang member stereotype.  However, it also addresses something I haven't seen before in a movie of this type, and something that was perfectly illustrated (unintentionally) by some of the unfavorable reviews posted here.  I'm referring to the character of Miklos, and how stereotypes within his own community about what is Latin contribute to the person he becomes.  There have been a few reviewers here who feel that the character of Miklos was not believable as Latino, as he was too white looking.  As I understand, that was exactly the point.  He was always having to prove himself as 'more latin than thou' because of his fair skin.  Somehow being 'more latin than thou' became akin to being a hardest of the hard gang member. I think that was the most compelling idea out of the movie because that sort of thing happens quite often.  Many Latinos subscribe to the stereotype that all latinos are a sort of medium brown.  Forgetting that Latino is not a race.  It refers to ethnicity.  You can be of any race and still be Latino. Those who don't fit into the stereotype of appearance sometimes try to find another way to 'be more Latin', and become susceptible to other, more insidious stereotypes. I've known my fair share of blue eyed blond Miklos who felt compelled to prove their Latin-ness by being a thug. So despite what has to be a record usage of the word ese, I found this movie a worthy viewing due to the addressing of this topic.

Growing up more or less together, all three start out as gang bangers, but each has a different destiny and in many ways one's destiny is caused by the actions of the others.Borrego gets injured in a gang retaliation and works hard to not become a cripple. He does however become both a painter of note and a drug addict of considerable appetite. A tragedy there sets him and Bratt apart.Bratt also winds up in a feud with Chapa. When both were young gang bangers and looking to retaliate for Borrego, Bratt and Chapa are arrested. Because this was Bratt's first offense he got a choice of the military or jail time and he chose the Marines. Chapa however was sent to prison, to San Quentin to be precise where he joined the Chicano prison gang La Onda. Pretty soon Chapa is high in the gang councils and deep in the politics of the prison. Bratt in the meantime joins the LAPD and destiny makes these two collide.Bound By Honor has an epic quality almost a kind of Chicano Gone With The Wind. The mostly Hispanic cast do a great job in depicting life in the Barrio. The film runs just about three hours and it's a tribute to director Taylor Hackford that your interest doesn't flag for a minute.Hackford also creates many interesting supporting characters two numerous to mention, always the mark of a good film. But your interest is always in the three leads. You get to care about what is to become of them, what destiny has in store.There are certain similarities between Bound By Honor and the Edward James Olmos film, American Me. Personally I give a slight edge to this one, don't miss it if it is broadcast.

Drug addiction, life in prison and 'betrayal' are the main subjects here and they don't fail to demand attention. I must honestly admit that I have watched this movie in awe, until the closing credits were gone. It's that good.Most of the actors aren't that famous (alright, you might recognize Benjamin Bratt for his role in Law & Order) and those who are have no real starring roles. In my opinion, this adds to the 'real feel' of the movie and is one of it's strong points (the casting, that is). Even Damian Chapa isn't bad in this movie (he usually is, think Street Fighter... Or U.S. Seals 2 S) and I must praise him for his work. Both stars and supporting actors performed magnificently.But in my opinion, the real credit should go to the writer and the director, who made such interesting and real topics in to an engaging, 3-hour long drama that manages to captivate it's audience.

You may think, based on the movie title as well, that it will be one of those gang action movies where the hero beats up everybody. It certainly starts that way, but the movie is not like that.After a while, when the plot expands a little more, you find that the white dude that comes to greet his Chicano friends is a halfbreed American Mexican who hates his white father and considers himself brown on the inside. He is also on parole and only days until he gets to be 18 and be totally free. Then he makes a stupid move. Now you think it is going to be one of those prison movies, with the misguided youth and the corrupt system. Perhaps he is going to go to prison and beat up everybody. That ain't it, either.It takes maybe a little to see that the movie isn't even close to being over so you look to the length of the film. It's 3 hours long! The fact that it starts showing the year in which things happen gives the final clue it is an epic story. The complexity of the characters hint at a book or something like that and, indeed, the story is written by poet Jimmy Santiago Baca, based on his personal experience. It's almost a biopic.And look at the cast! Damian Chapa is pretty known, but also Benjamin Bratt, Delroy Lindo, Victor Rivers (can't have a movie about Mexicans without Rivers - I really think he should have gotten more main roles), Billy Bob Thornton, Ving Rhames, Danny Trejo and even Jimmy Santiago Baca himself as Gato, who I don't really remember.About the movie itself, its main strength is the characters. Each of the lead characters is being carefully sketched and then transformed by the story. The ending, most of all, explains the feelings and reality of the people involved. There were criticisms that the movie was overacted sometimes. Perhaps, but most of it was actually in character. Miklo is someone who is desperately, so desperately, trying to belong. Of course he overacts. His whole character is made up in his head.So, as a conclusion to this too long review this is not a masterpiece, but it is a movie about the truth of people in those times, and it is well done. Truthful films are more and more scarce as the time goes by. If you find the time and mood to watch this white Mexican biopic, I don't think you will be disappointed.

It should be thought of in those terms. Both films track members of a family who are in mob-like organizations. Blood In, Blood Out tracks the fate of family members involved in gangs but some of whom try to go straight, while The Godfather is more concerned with the internal machinations of the criminal organization.That said, the films tracks several boys who during their youth are parts of illegal criminal families. I think this film is criminally underrated. Both the first and second Godfather films deserve their plaudits and the performances, direction, and script combined to make for compelling inter-generational dramas. However, this film is no different. It does not track such a lengthy period of time, but we see significant character development, multi-layered story lines, and large numbers of peripheral characters who also play important parts in the film.The acting in this film is brilliant from the three leads Benjamin Bratt, Jesse Borrego, and most notably, Damian Chapa. Chapa as Miclo is the light-skinned, blue-eyed Latino whose appearance has always driven him to prove how loyal a Latino he was and which leads him into a lot of trouble. Chapa's performance depicts Miclo as scared and unsure as a youngster, but as he grows older, he becomes more sure of himself and more committed to his lifestyle. Chapa delivers an intense, energetic performance which really should have led to more opportunities for him, had he wanted them. Jesse Borrego as Cruz is a talented artist whose life falls prey to drugs but who survives and doesn't forget his origins and values. Borrego make Cruz an imp with a twinkle in his eye which never goes out, no matter how far he falls and Borrego's performance also shows a great deal of depth. Bratt is Paco, perhaps the most troubled as a youngster, but whose life changes fortuitously before it can spin too far out of control. The three leads are cousins, and their courses in life converge and diverge in interesting and not unrealistic ways.There is great supporting work from actors like Delroy Lindo, Enrique Castillo, Carlos Carrasco, Victor Rivers, and many others. The script and screenplay are fantastic, chronicling about 13 or 14 years with great ease but without sacrificing complexity. The story is based on the experiences of artist Jimmy Santiago Baca and he helped to write the screenplay.For me, the relationships among the races in prison is the most fascinating part of the film. Race defines one's position in prison. The unity of the members of a race will determine how powerful that race is in prison. This is not a film for kids. The violence is not soft-pedaled. It is brutal and unapologetic. Director Taylor Hackford should be applauded for not shrinking from a not particularly feelgood story. He allows the film to breathe and allows the tragedy and triumph to play out. I have read some reviewers critique the length of this film and while I sympathize, I don't know which parts they would remove. I don't find that the film drags at all and the relationships within the family, within racial groups, and between racial groups, make this a film that will withstand repeated viewing.

Thats right. It really is epic at least when you consider the length. 190 minutes of drama which encompasses 13 years and many twists and turns. It was like seeing a movie twice over. And its pretty hard for me to sit and do the same thing that long. But thank god it was nice or i would have been lying on the bed all day with a headache. And it amazes me that I sat through a movie that long without much fuss. It was pretty nice. The LA which many outsiders never see or hear about. The east LA, the gang wars, the drugs, inmates running the prisons and rape attempt on a white prisoner. And thirteen years of twist and turns in the fortune of the three brothers and their familias as tragedy and happiness went hand in hand of a community which just wanted to live and work with dignity as some of their own went the wrong way and destroyed their careers and lives. And with much of the second half happening in the prison it needed a good genuine drama which thankfully is delivered. The prison and the stories feel real. And you feel destroyed as you see criminals getting criminalized in an institution made to reform them. Gay cooks and prisoners and racially segregated groups which ran their business from the inside in lieu of money. Attacks being planned and committed on fellow prisoners. Its all there as it takes a lot out of you to watch and absorb all this and more for more three hours. But all said and done it engrosses you for most the time and its only in the middle when not much is happening when you look at the time remaining. But as the plotting and action starts you again get absorbed. I got out with a real good knowledge of the people and a side of one of my favorite cities I never knew about. For that I am happy that I watched this.Read more at http//hightensionmovies.blogspot.in/ "},{"Title":"Three Latino gang members follow divergent but related paths criminal, cop and artist","Date":"11 July 2012","Score":"","Genre":"Crime, Drama","Review":" This movie is average. It's a 5 or a 6. It has a number of problems and a number of good points. The good points are that it's an ambitious film that makes a serious attempt to show the changing lives of three different men from the barrio from the time they are about 18 to when they are 30. They are bound together by blood, by background, and by gang. But their actions eventually lead to one being in jail, another being a cop and a third being an artist.This is not Manhattan Melodrama, however. There is far more realism. Most of the focus is on the prison life of Miklo (Damian Chapa). In the prison are three gangs, divided by race brown, black, and white. Their rivalries for power play a critical part in the film, and it's almost as much about these gangs as anything else. This is a strong point of the script. The character arcs of the three leads create another strong point.The main problem with the movie, in my opinion, is the direction of Taylor Hackford. There are simply too many scenes in which the actors are shouting at each other at the top of their lungs. The director should also have had a hand in cutting down the excessively wordy lines that clutter up many scenes. A movie is not a book. There are some group scenes that are not well staged or managed at all and in which the result is awkward. The script has too much verbal exposition and explanation. It has clich√©s and lacks progressive tension, but good direction and acting might have overcome these issues. Unfortunately, it seems to me that the acting abilities and charisma of the actors varied widely. They just didn't all pull off their roles. Some did, and others didn't.I was straining to watch this one to the end. I didn't find it particularly engaging and that's due to how it was written and executed, not the story or characters.UPDATE After writing the above, I went back and read my review of Against All Odds by the same director, written more than 2 months ago. Interestingly, some of my criticisms of that movie are similar to those made here.

I did jail counseling and had exposure to the gangs, drugs, prison and street scenes that are shown in this movie are remarkably real and true to life and behind bars. Very nicely done for realism sake and schockingly accurate. Mom and dad in this movie are the streets and you and your family live by clique rules. Large cliques determine right and wrong and something even more powerful than that disciplines everyone which is the prison systems. Both ways fail and this movie chronicles that failure while staying true to the what they have to work with...real life. It is a long story told so that you can hitch a ride with it and then be roped in. Once in, fasten your seat belt and pray for a bathroom break...Its the only thing that will break the tension at times. Take heart, the players deliver you to an ending that helps you to recover your breath and resume a normal life.

It sounded like just another gang movie and i wasn't interested in watching another movie like that. Then when i was sick one day it came on cable and i decided to watch it. As soon as the first 1/2 hour passed, I was sorry I didn't watch it sooner. This movie was well done! A very good depiction of street and prison gangs..(the fact that some of the actors and crew either were involved in gangs or had done time in jail helped make some of the roles more believable).The saddest character in the movie is the main protagonist Miklo Velka. despite his mother being a brown-eyed, blk haired Mexican, his white father's features constantly make him an outsider in his own community and his willingness to do whatever it takes to be accepted by his own people ends up having disastrous consequences for all involved in his life in the 12 years that the film takes place.One other thing I saw in the movie that really surprised me is when Popeye tells Miklo that he cannot get mad at another Latino in jail because they were both from rival gangs. In prison, they have to unite if they want to survive. I saw that as a unity born out of need to protect themselves.If you are Latin, regardless of type (cuban, Puerto-Rican,Peruvian,Mexican etc) see this movie.

But first some trivia The AV is based in the AB gang called the Aryan Brotherhood. Their members are known and respected in prisons for being especially murderous and ruthless though having smaller numbers than the other gangs. The BGA is based on the BGF black gorilla family gang (Delroy Lindo did a great job as Bonafide). They are a real gang and they claim to be politically motivated and are interested in black power. La Onda, as previously stated in another comment is based on La Eme or the Mexican Mafia. The members must deny its existence just like the real mafia or face death. These really are the three gangs that run the prisons in LA and across the country to this day. Also the concept of prison violence spilling onto the streets is a real issue. most gang violence in LA is Black on Black or Hispanic on Hispanic but when there is a war in the jails that is the main time that there is interracial violence on the streets. This is depicted well in the movie. More trivia The Tres Puntos gang is based on a tattoo that many Hispanic gangs get with 3 dots. They signify the three possible ways out of a gang prison, hospital, and death. The only flaw to this movie is that the actors may have overacted a little. This genre of movies rarely lends itself to great acting opportunities. think of the other great movies of its type e.g. Boyz in the hood, new jack city, menace to society. none of them won awards for best actor. but what sets this apart is that none of them touched on the jail aspect as much as this one did. The other nice thing was that nothing horrible happened at the end. Arguably everyone ended up alright, which is rare in this genre. Miklo became the boss of a powerful gang and spread the gang to other prisons, and Paco and Cruzito became friends again. On a side note, the slang used in this movie may be my favorite part.

Prison gangs have been deemed a security threat in every American prison, state or federal, and how members and family are bonded. This film portrays the life of a biracial man (Damian Chapa, known as Carmine in Money Talks) that is hated by his real father (a Caucasian), and before he turns 18, murders a rival gang member to avenge his cousin's (Jesse Borrego) maiming, after he is bodyslammed onto a fire hydrant.  This event changes the lives of the three youths in the film. One youth ends up becoming an artist, and a heroin addict, after his near-serious injury from the bodyslam, another goes to boot camp (Benjamin Bratt), after being arrested by the LAPD, and becoming a police officer, and the other ends up in prison, and ascends up the hierarchy of being a prison gang leader.  The Miklo character would be the focal point in the insurrection that occurs in the penitentiary, while the other men live separate lives.  The saddest scene in the film is the Cruz character, where he ends up being a heroin addict, and is devastated by the death of his younger brother, when he ODs after a trial shot.  This leads to Cruz being ostracised by his family, and this fuels the resentment by his half brother, the detective.   Lots of familiar faces, especially Thomas F. Wilson (Biff Tanner in the Back to the Future flicks) and Billy Bob Thornton (Armageddon) as a Nazi.

I suspect that The Godfather was on the minds of some involved in this production while it was being made. Certainly, the character of Miklo is as tragic a figure as Michael Corleone, and also shows he is a traitor to himself and his mentor, much the way Corleone betrayed his own brother. Also, The Family has utmost importance in both films, but this film falters in places where Godfather excelled, and so it does not deserve the same consideration. "},{"Title":"Blood In Blood Out...

Therefore it has adopted the familiar course of amateurs, and that is to add everything in the story without giving it a balance and counter balance. There is no editorial overview of how to shape material within a reasonable time period. It is also very very long ...Anna Karenina is long, but that was by Tolstoy and he has some claim to be one of the greatest writers of all time.Fourthly, the actors oh well, and the report card is depressing. Basically two modes of action. The leads are all generally terrible, especially Mr Chapa, whose performance might be compared to a guard dog with distemper. Such monotony should not be viewed in a feature film.As with anything that that exemplifies all that is detritus in film making, there are so many other things to mention but space precludes a fuller list of its faults. The music for instance, with its deliberate sentimental Spanish guitar style in the few quiet moments showed all the artistic intelligence of a fast food restaurant franchise.Almost anything on earth is better than wasting the time that is this dreadful waste of one's own too short life.

I was simply blown away by the ensemble acting and cinematography. The DVD version that I have runs about 3 hours long and it doesn't drag for one second. I remained drawn into the story from beginning to end. The level of realism in the drama that unfolds is eerie. The relationships that are displayed between the characters are impeccably played out. You get a real sense of family between the half-brothers and the cousin (the three main characters), and see it develop between Miklo and his prison familia as well. The making of featurette on the DVD really took me by surprise, and revealed with crystal clarity the depth of Taylor Hackford's vision and motivation to create this cinematic masterpiece. I echo the sentiments of comments I've seen expressing an interest in a full director's cut (4+ hours) and/or a disc with deleted scenes at the very least. There isn't anything predictable about this film (in my opinion), and it is truly a rare film experience that is full of surprises. For a work of fiction, it is obviously based in real experience, which Jimmy Santiago Baca was able to forge on paper and Taylor Hackford was able to bring to the screen, with no apologies needed or implied.

But Blood In Blood Out, is far superior in pure entertainment value, in my opinion.  I have watched it (all 3 plus hours) many times and I have never gotten tired of it.  It is the kind of movie that sucks you in and is hard to press STOP once it gets going.I think that all the actors except one were great, especially Benjamin Bratt, Enrique Castillo, and Jesse Borrego.  It was especially amusing to see good old Billy Bob Thornton, as a neo-Nazi.The only actor that I do not include in the greatness is the more or less star Damian Chapa as Milko.  While other actors in the film had their overacting moments, this guy just wouldn't quit.  Every scene was just way too overdone with him and by the end he was just plain obnoxious.I give this movie a ten in spite of Chapa.

We see them tackle their life in different ways and following different paths. Each path is their own but sometimes they lead to a crossroad.Many people just assume that this is a gangster movie because it contains the ghetto, Chicanos, prison, drugs and violence. But it is so much more. The ghetto is a importent part of their life's but the actual drama could easily been a king's court or something else Shakespearian.Many people I have seen this movie with complains about the acting but even if the actors are poor the characters still seem true. Often the ghetto turns into the fourth main character when we see how alive it really is.This is my all time favorite film. First watched it at a young age about twelve or so. At that moment I found the gang-members to be something cool. When I then got it for Christmas two years back and re-watched I was astounded by the settings, multiple plots and the human drama that occurs.

A storyline that converts characters and shows change as time proceeds.  It triggers the question of honoring the family and who to call family (in this case, familia).  Viewer takes a step in the lives of the three friends, Paco (Benjamin Bratt), Cruz (Jesse Borrego), and Miklo (Damian Chapa).  The actors play their rolls to a tee, showing examples of if my character were in this situation, what would he do.  Paco is the hard-worker in all aspects - to be the big dog for either good or bad.  Miklo looks up to Paco and strives to be that big dog, also in all aspects, however, he grasps a hold on his destiny.  And Cruz is the artist and medium of the two - with the word artist used in its generalization of being liberated, depressed, and isolated.  The storyline begins with them together, then follows them unto their own paths, to only conclude with a means of reconciliation. Taylor Hackford uses the simplicity of shots to carry out this story.  He uses quick shot sequences presenting montages of what the viewer needs to know.  Also, usage of close-ups involving emotional eyes, as seen in his prior film, An Officer and a Gentleman.  A very good storyline to exemplify character revolution.  Bound by Honor takes the viewer within a world less known.

The story, plot, and acting is very powerful and interesting.It shows how Cruz, Paco, and Miklo started off as one, then drifted off into thier own set of personal problems, but always intertwinded with each other.  The gangs in the prison San Quentin were very well acted out.  The BGA (Black Guerilla Army), the AV'ers (Aryan Vanguard), and La Onda were acted out very well.  It shows how miserable prison life can really be if you don't belong to the RIGHT group.The characters were great  Big Al, Red Ryder, Pockets, Bonafide, Wallace, Montana, Magic, Miklo, Chuey, Cruz, Juanito, Popeye, Carlos, and the rest.

This movie is more entertaining, but I'm not knocking American Me. One thing about this movie, Is Miklo a virgin in this movie?  He went into jail at age 18, then was only out for a bit till he went back in.  There were no scences with him with any women.  I found that interesting.  I give it 9 1/2 out of 10.

It's a movie about life.What makes it so great for me? Although I heard from some people that they don't like the acting, and maybe in some parts that's true (after all there's no one like Al Pacino or *add a favorite actor name here*). But it's more than appropriate for this movie and it's not distracting at all. In fact I was hooked by the movie from beginning to end.The story that is told here needs the film to be long and not one minute of it seems boring. The characters grab you from the very start and you feel with them the whole movie. Everything that happens to them, you are there to witness it and feel with/for them. That makes a good drama.I love every aspect of the movie. The only thing that I could complain about is, then whenever this movie is on somewhere (on TV) and I see it, I can't switch the TV off or change the channel.

The movie has a clever ending, I'm sure I have seen a similar type ending in another movie, cant remember which. Although it is a 3 hour movie, it does entertain. The acting is efficient from the cast. If this had a better and popular starcast, it probably would of been among the Best Movies. Al Pacino or Robert De Niro would of suited in Benjamins role.

From the ' Homies from a rough part of town learning the meaning of unity and family' plot, to the godawfull dialog. Too much we gotta stick together, homes!, i'll never forgive you, you killed my brother!, and ITS NOT THE COLOR OF YOUR SKIN, IT'S WHAT'S INSIDE THAT COUNTS!!! for my liking,thankyouverymuch.The Clich√© alarm was going nuts on this one, i tell you.Thirdly, it was all so sickeningly heartwarming, or at least it tried to be. Yes i understand the value of true friendship, and the pain of loss, and no, I don't need to be told again.Oh no... Apparently we need another BUT I LOVE YOU BROTHER!!! scene.Fourth, DID I MENTION IT WAS THREE HOURS LONG?!?!?!?!?! oh yeah, sorry.I'm sure that everyone in england (sorry rest of the world) will understand me when i sayBasically, this film is nothing more than a latino homeboy version of the One woman's struggle films that BBC2 puts out at midnight EVERY FREAKIN NIGHT.It is that bad, believe me, it will save you three hours watching time, plus the inevitable two days of I can't believe I actually sat all the way through that film that will follow.My intelligence feels raped.

In the film; Miklo's father was a White man who married a Mexican woman and gave birth to to Miklo but was racist against Mexicans? This movie is genocide, it is suicide, it is destroying our youth and crippling our communities. To some degree it glorifies the Gang culture, it promotes violence and encourages children to become gang members and end up in prison. Boycott this racist filth along with that half-hater, white man's lap-dog, murderer, sell-out Edward Olmos James and his racist movie American Me Put a stop to our genocide! "}]
