I think that it is also one of his best films. We watch his character train throughout the movie for a fight at the end. The martial arts throughout are very well done. This is one of those films you can watch every time it is on TV. If you like martial arts movies you will probably enjoy this one. The movie though is all about the final fight. Like many other films of its type. All in all van dam is great and if you want to see a film based on the martial arts that doesn't have Druce Lee or Jackie Chan or Jet Li in it then this movie is one for you. The story is pretty simple but the fight scenes are worth it so go for it. 7 out of 10.

In this picture J.C.V.D. plays the younger brother of a unbeaten American kick boxer who lusts for some real competition. So he decides to go to the home of Muay Thai kick boxing, Thailand. There he realizes that he doesn't know squat about the true art of kick boxing. He learns a painful lesson. His younger brother decides to learn Muay Thai and avenge his brother's honor.Not a bad movie. Entertaining and a good time waster. But for some reason the producers decided to franchise out this series. The rest of the films are a mixed bag at best. The more they made the least interesting they became until the final results were unwatchable. As always with these films the first film is usually the best of the bunch. Jean-Claude plays his character with a thick euro-accent (I forgot how they explained it). He's physically impressive so it's kind of hard to swallow his naivet√© about fighting and what not.

You're not going to miss Van Damme's hammy acting, his trademark splits, or his harsh (although according to some sources, inaccurate) training and portrayal in and of the Thai sport of Muay Thai, are you?Of course you do. The Muscles From Brussels goes Thai in this 1989 adventure, with the Belgian actor exploring the martial arts fundamentals of Muay Thai, the national sport of Thailand, which has gained wider recognition in the West because it's the de facto fighting style for mixed martial arts and Thai-native newcomer Tony Jaa seeks to promote his tiny country's greatest commodity for a worldwide audience. But this is a Van Damme movie, first and foremost. True he's no great actor, but there's something about his work here that makes me want to watch Kickboxer again and again.First things first, what is Muay Thai? As already stated, it's the national sport of Thailand, where the fighter will condition his body so that his arms and legs become weapons capable of delivering blows, kicks in particular, that are three times as powerful as that of any ordinary martial artist. He'll also use his feet, fists, shins, and elbows too. If one wants to go all out, two guys will get in a ring and have themselves a rope-fist fight, where the fighters' wrists are bound in rope and covered with broken glass. Isn't that mean and nasty?To begin Kickboxer, Van Damme is Kurt Sloane, brother of Eric (Dennis Alexio), the top kickboxer in the United States. Tiring of the generic competition of his native soil, he travels with brother Kurt to Bangkok, where he hopes to dethrone the current champ Tong Po (Michel Qissi), who has a reputation for fighting dirty. Kurt first sees this towering mountain of flesh and muscle kicking the hell out of a support beam in the locker room; that's the first clue to Kurt that Eric shouldn't get in the ring, but he's not listening.And Eric fights anyway, against baby brother's warnings.To make long stories short, Eric takes quite a beating in the ring but a series of illegal blows delivered after Kurt throws in the towel cripple Eric for life. So what went wrong? According to some sources, American Kickboxing is a watered-down form of Muay Thai, so it's no wonder Tong Po got the upper hand so quickly on Eric, who despite his excellent training and peak physical condition, only landed a few lucky punches on the towering fighter. Apparently, Muay Thai is strictly for street fighting, not something for refined martial artists like Kurt and Eric.To teach Tong Po a lesson in humility, Kurt contacts American Winston Taylor (Haskell V. Anderson III) to seek out a venerated Thai master, Xian Chow (Dennis Chan), to learn the art of Muay Thai, and so the training begins. Kurt first puts aside his already-planted Karate training and strengthens his body, kicks tree stumps until the scar tissue prevents any kind of feeling aside from invincibility, learns a little about Asian spirituality, and even flirts with Chow's niece Mylee (Rochelle Ashana). What it all culminates in, of course, is a no-holds-barred Rocky IV-style showdown using the ancient rope-fists between Kurt and Tong Po.As someone who knows next to nothing about Muay Thai (in fact, much of what I know comes from Wikipedia and the special features section of the Ong-Bak The Thai Warrior DVD), I found Kickboxer to still be quite entertaining. It's brutal stuff, really, so it's no wonder Muay Thai is gaining such greater notoriety in the United States. As Kurt Sloane, Van Damme is good (despite his acting limitations in showing emotions), his performance notwithstanding, and none of the other performers are really worth speaking of either, but Tong Po is a nasty villain and his one speaking line You bleed like Mylee; Mylee good f**k sends chills down the spine.The fights are another thing and are what this feature co-directed by Mark DiSalle and David Worth seems to specialize in. The fights are spectacular (as with any martial arts movie that features Van Damme doing his trademark splits and 360-degree flying spin-kick), which does include one sequence where Kurt gets drunk, starts dancing, and takes on the patrons at a bar.This Kickboxer - it's a kick, just don't let it kick you in the head too much with its lackadaisical script and lame-brain plotting.7/10 "},{"Title":"One of Jean-Claude Dammes best movies","Date":"29 July 2005","Score":"14 out of 18 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Sport","Review":" This movie is really good and its about a Kickboxer and his brother who go to Thailand to fight the Thai Kick boxing champion and the American Kickboxer loses and ends up being paralyzed and then his brother gos and gets kick boxing training in a remote part of Thailand to revenge his brother.There are heaps of good scenes in this movie like all of the scenes of the city Bangkok and of all of the beautiful temples and the great fight scenes in the end of the movie.This movie stars good actors like the great action star Jean-Claude Van Damme,Dennis Chan,Dennis Alexio,Michel Qissi and Haskell V.

It has some good fights, and some interesting moments showing the difficulty of training and trying to achieve your best while not losing your focus. Although it suffers from some cheesy acting, dialogue, music, and a highly disturbing dance scene, this is a must for Van Damme fans, and those with an interest in martial arts movies who don't want to stray too far from the West.Van Damme stars as Kurt Sloane, the younger brother of a flashy American Kickboxer. They train together, but his brother Eric seems to be more interested in looking like a good fighter than actually finding the ability and skill to be one. Eric takes part in a fighting competition and is crippled and almost killed by Tong Po, and fearsome Kickboxer with a great rage and discipline. Kurt decides to avenge his brother, but no-one will train him as they believe Tong Po is too popular and strong. Eventually he finds a trainer in the middle of nowhere who teaches him to reach his full potential and push through the barriers which he never though he could surpass. He also meets Winston Tyler who provides some laughs, and Mylee who provides some style. Of course it is the fights that matter, and the revenge plot is safe enough to give the fights reason. Rather than cheap montages, we see the tough training regime Kurt goes through, and see Tong Po kicking a cement wall to build up the strength and invulnerability of his foot. Sounds odd yes, but how else would we know he's a hard lad? Anyway, a good film for fight fans, light-hearted and fast and worth watching.7.5 out of 10 "}{"Title":"The ultimate feel good movie...........","Date":"24 August 2003","Score":"5 out of 5 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Sport","Review":"  Well, thats how a Van Damme fan like myself would describe this because thats how I feel before, during and after viewing it.Back in that late 80's early 90's period, Jean Claude Van Damme kept the good times coming, one film after another, the man could do no wrong.......then the Soviet Union broke apart, everyone was owning a PC, cell phones became dime a dozen, reality tv...........you get the deal here.........I guess a good thing never lasts forever.  Anyway, back to Kickboxer, which is a classic JCVD and martial arts film, with a touching and believable story.........Mr. Van Damme must climb to the top of the mountain here, and by God, between the funny one liners and the splits, he makes it there!  Van Damme as Kurt Sloane makes a great team with Dennis Chan (Xian) and of course Haskell Vaughn Anderson III (Taylor) providing more coolness here.  Not forgetting his brother, the love interest and the bad guys.

With his brother/ringman Kurt by his side, he feels he cannot lose. That is, until he faces off against the most fearsome fighter in Thailand, if not the world the dreaded Tong Po (himself...actually Qissi) Despite Kurt warning him to not get in the ring with him, Eric pridefully ignores his brother and fights Tong Po. The evil Po mercilessly beats Eric so badly he paralyzes him for life. Seeking revenge for his brother's crippling, Kurt sets out to learn Muay Thai and beat Tong Po in the ring. No school will accept him, so, working on a tip from ex-Special Forces Vietnam vet Winston (Anderson), Kurt goes to the Thai countryside to receive lessons from master Xian Chow (Chan). Chow puts him through his paces, but ends up falling in love with Mylee (Ashana) in the meantime. Gangster Freddy Li (Lee) has bet millions on the upcoming fight, AND Tong Po assaulted Mylee, AND he wants to get revenge, so with all the pressure building, will Kurt defeat Tong Po? Here's another Van Damme classic from the golden year of 1989. Most people, even if they're not action fans, are at least aware of Kickboxer. Even a David Letterman Top Ten List of the day featured the topic top ten things overheard while waiting in line for Kickboxer. Underground fighting movies had hit the mainstream and had their brief moment in the spotlight. And Van Damme was spearheading the trend, thereby becoming one of the faces of the action movie movement of the late 80's/early 90's. While Kickboxer falls squarely in the middle in terms of the quality of his Punchfighting era (the best being Bloodsport, 1988 and the weakest being The Quest, 1996 - as always it's open for debate but that's our opinion), it has a much imitated, never equaled kind of feel to it and even though it's a little on the long side, it never really gets boring.It may be a bit of a stretch to believe Alexio and Van Damme are brothers, but, that aside, in the movie, Eric disregards Kurt's advice to not fight Tong Po, thus reinforcing the old saying always listen to your Van Damme. But the brothers in Bangkok do share a genetic sense for fashion, as stonewashed denim vests and half-shirts seem to be the order of the day. But Van Damme steals the show in the wardrobe department when he unleashes what can only be described as a tanktop with suspenders for straps. And for no explained reason, for the final face-off with Tong Po, they are BOTH wearing silly loincloths that leave criminally little to the imagination. How did they both know wear a freakin' loincloth to this particular battle? Presumably they didn't talk beforehand and arrange it - it's surprising they both weren't embarrassed, like two women who wear the same outfit to a party.There are some excellent and picturesque Thai locations, there's a great song at every turn which smartly keeps the energy going (most of which are by AOR artist Stan Bush), and at one point one character says to Van Damme, I'm not signing your death warrant. Seeing as the movie of that name came out the next year, could this line be an inspiration? Also in 1990 came a similarly-themed movie to Kickboxer, The King of the Kickboxers (1990), where Keith Cooke takes over the rural Thai trainer role. But one thing that movie does not have, nor any of the myriad training sequence movies that followed in its wake has, is one very important element the Van Damme dance. Yes, part of Kurt's training is to go to a roadside cafe, get drunk, then bust a move with some local ladies. The movie pretty much stops - as it should - so we can see Van Damme get funky on the dance floor. Not since Breakin' (1984) where he claps along to the beat in his wrestling singlet have we seen his expertise with rhythm. Definitely a movie - nay - a career highlight for JCVD. He should have danced more in his movies.One other note like how in Best of the Best 2 (1990), the name Brakus is constantly and continuously said throughout the movie, here the name Tong Po is the constantly-said name. These writers were sure proud of their bad-guy names. While the popularity of this movie led to the inevitable flood of sequels (where Sasha Mitchell replaces Van Damme), this original is truly a video store classic and a worthy movie in its own right.

I would think that as much as some highbrow film fans roll their eyes and look down their noses at these type of action movies, they do at least acknowledge the fighting artistry and choreography on show. They, you hope, stay away and leave the ass kicking fans and nostalgists to wallow in their cheese and beaten body pulp kingdoms. I mean why would an arty film lover seek out an early Van Damme movie anyway?I love Kickboxer, I really do, when I first caught it on release I could be found trying to do some of those wonderful Van Damme moves, rewatching the key moments over and over again, enjoying immensely the adrenalin rush that comes as we go slow-mo and Jean-Claude goes about dismantling uber bastard villain Tiger Tong Po (Michel Qissi). Now, well over twenty years later, I still get that rush, I can't do the moves, mind, I nearly put my shoulder out just punching the air in triumph as a mullet headed Dennis Alexio sticks his thumb up from his wheelchair, but all the thrills are still there, the skills on show still amazing. Hell, there's even a pet thread of substance, damn those animal threads, that cool dog better not get killed! Grrrrrrrr.Of course now, viewing with older and wiser eyes, you can see the clunkiness of the script, the lame-brained plotting and excuses for Van Damme to flash the flesh and show his dexterity. There's even one of the worst dance sequences ever put down on film, so bad I can't believe I never laughed out loud at the cinema all those years ago. Yet it's still a wonderful movie, often exhilarating, the thematics of second chances (Haskell V. Anderson III having a great old time of it as Winston Taylor), revenge and different cultures, these impact greatly on the picture. Then there's Dennis Chan as Xian Chow, giving Pat Morita a run for his money as the most fun cinematic Martial Arts trainer, the real location photography in Thailand, the training sequences and of course we get to learn about the ancient sport of Muay Thai. There's a lot of good here to off set the saggy cheese.There are some truly awful Van Damme movies out there, case in point Cyborg which was released the same year as Kickboxer, and without doubt the quality of Van Damme movies improved in the 90s as his stock began to rise and the budgets went higher. But this is a goody for his fans to lap up, a film to sit alongside Bloodsport as one of the two best action movies from his early body of work. And I love it so. 8/10 "},{"Title":"Truly 80's Van Damme","Date":"12 July 2007","Score":"2 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Sport","Review":" This film has all the hallmarks of a classic Van Damme martial arts/art-house movie. The opening credit sequence is pure genius, going along the river in a power boat, Van Damme wearing a sleveless denim jacket, his on screen brother wearing a floral shirt, sleeves rolled up, permed mullet and moustache flowing in the wind. I particularly enjoyed watching van damme put his arm around his brother as they sailed through the river, very homo-erotic. The cheesy 80's song to accompany this scene is like the cherry on the cake, with lyrics like I Don't Care What You Think, I Could Kill If You Blink, we know we're in for a treat with this movie.As usual with Van Damme films we are shown in the most subtle of manners how he developed his Belgian accent. We discover that Jean Claude was raised in Europe and learnt Ballet whilst his brother was raised in America by their father. I made the presumption the parents were divorced.Watching Jean Claude learn Mui Thai with Master Zian was awe inspiring and gave a true insight into the 'old ways' of mastering this martial art. He did not need to visit a Mui Thai school or perhaps indulge in a few evening classes. No, it involved having his legs pulled apart with ropes, kicking down palm trees, coconuts dropped onto him from a great height, raw meat tied to his legs so dogs would chase him, being kept underwater whilst performing various kicks and finally training in the ruined temple where he could hear the noises made by the ancient warriors.The best scene in the film is set in the waterfront bar, where Zian gets Van Damme drunk. Van Damme shows John Travolta a few moves, whilst wearing black patent boots, trousers pulled up to his waist and a tight vest top, he dances by doing the splits, wiggling his torso and randomly clapping his hands. The soundtrack is superb and the girls he is dancing with look totally lost, which is again, all part of the brilliance. The following fight scene is astounding, with Van Damme kicking 2 guys at once in mid air, kicking a short guy ramming him with a table, into the water and slapping someone with both hands on the side of the head. Bruce Lee, eat your heart out.I particularly enjoyed the scene with Freddy Lee in his Miami Vice style mansion and pool, full of bikini clad women.The clothes in this film are pure high fashion, sleveless denim jackets, high waist banded trousers with black vest and skimpy brightly coloured sports shorts.The final battle is a classic, Van Damme manages to land 5 or even 6 hits per punch onto Tong Po after nearly being shredded to death by his opponents glass clothed hands. Again, at the end, the credits roll with another fantastic soundtrack with lyrics like Never surrender, never say die, you've got the heart of a hero.This film borders on a comedy, and the more seriously it takes itself, the funnier it gets. Ignore the sequels, this is the one to watch.

Having beaten everyone that he can in America, he's talked into travelling to the home of kickboxing in Thailand to see if he can take on the best that they have to offer. However, Eric ends up paralysed after a fight with Thailand's best Tong Po (Michel Qissi). Eric's brother Kurt (Jean-Claude Van Damme) is determined to avenge Po for what he did to his brother and sets about training and preparing for the fight of his life with the assistance of Xian Chow (Dennis Chan).Kickboxer seems to be remembered as one of the defining films for Van Damme and watching it again today I can't help but be reminded at how lazy and unimaginative that this film feels as a whole. Let's look at some examples....We have a Rocky 4 scenario at the start where we have a cocky champion that underestimates his opponent and ends up paying the price for this (albeit the champion's fate was much worse in Rocky 4, but the general consensus is the same).Kickboxer then switches tone and becomes a karate kid style film whereby an unassuming martial arts genius takes a pupil under his wing and provides him with the necessary training to defeat his opponent.This all sounds OK in writing, but somehow these elements don't translate quite as well on screen; for one thing this film lacks the entertainment value that Rocky 4 offered; sure Rocky 4 was agenda heavy, but it was entertaining. The other problem with this film is that The Karate Kid element is weak compared to Karate Kid; the training montages were dull and unimaginative for the most part (although some elements did make me laugh so this aspect of the narrative wasn't a complete failure). If we continue to draw comparisons then it's almost impossible to overlook the fact that Van Damme lacks the vulnerability of Macchio who looked like a 5 stone weakling in the Karate Kid. Van Damme is the 'Muscles from Brussels' so to see him training as a rookie in martial arts was a tough sell to say the least.Kickboxer is a predictable film which isn't necessarily a bad thing, but the clich√©d turn of events at the end was almost too much to bear (Kurt is getting his ass kicked, but then when Po announces that he raped his woman Kurt seems to whirr into action). It's an obvious plot device and to be honest it would have been better if we'd have just seen Kurt kicking Po's ass because of all the training that he'd had).I noted at the start of the film that Van Damme was responsible for the fight choreography and for that he does deserve some credit. A lot of the fight scenes were intense and quite well-staged.There are other problems with this film such as cheesy dialogue, wooden acting and awful dubbing, but given the fact that this is a JCVD film these are forgivable flaws. However, the lazy and overly familiar plot line that plagues Kickboxer only helps to remind us of the better films that it tries and fails to emulate.

I don't know why but Kickboxer is one of those films that seems to bring back memories of your past, well it certainly did for me because it was one of my favourite martial arts films as a child. My other favourite martial arts films being things like Fist of Fury and Enter the Dragon starring the famous Bruce Lee. The story is basically about a young man called Kurt Sloane (Van Damme) who despite having no fighting experience or interest, decides to learn martial arts under a trainer, so he can take on the dangerous and evil Tong Po and avenge his brother. Kickboxer is one of the films that basically kick started Van Damme's movie career. Van Damme was the real deal throughout the 90s, performing in so many successful martial arts and action movies. If you're a Van Damme fan, then I'm sure Kickboxer is up there amongst your favourites. If you haven't seen it, then it is worth watching. What I really loved about this film were the soundtracks.

At any rate Kickboxer is a fantastically fun film to watch. It attempts to (and does successfully) explore the story of a man seeking Vengeance, learning to better himself and discovering ancient methods of training to fight that much of the world had forgotten ever existed.Jean-Claude Van Damme is in his prime here. Strong, powerful and about as masculine as a human male can get. In real life, Van Damme's combination of training methods brought something to film screens around the world that had never been seen before. A classically trained black belt in Karate, combined with a Kickboxing career and formal training in ballet. Yes, ballet. It sound like such an odd combination and yet it translates beautifully into a man who would become a world famous action star. Capable of amazing feats involving balance, flexibility and fighting combined with a muscular, ripped physique and dare I say a perfect set of facial features that make him insanely attractive. It's just astonishing and the only other actor I could even consider comparing him to would be Arnold Schwarzenegger. Although I think Schwarzenegger has better acting skills, he and Van Damme share that amazing unique set of god given talents both physical and mental that set them apart from almost every other action star that's ever lived. Now that I'm done drooling over Van Damme, back to the movie review.It truly is a fantastic, male oriented action film the likes of which Hollywood rarely turns out anymore. The film starts off with a light hearted happy feeling as Kurt (Van Damme) accompanies his older brother Eric to a fight where Eric, already a champion Kickboxer defeats yet another opponent and then announces his next fight will be in Thailand. Eric, on a high from all of his wins fails to realize that Thailand's champion is a ruthless fighter named Tong Po who's backed by the Asian mafia.When Eric finally faces off against Tong Po, Po not only defeats Eric but permanently and intentionally paralyzes him so that he will never fight again. In this instant, the light hearted feeling of the film is gone. Kurt and Eric are two Americans alone in a foreign land with no friends and no idea where to turn next. But Kurt knows one thing for certain, he wants revenge against Tong Po and he's willing to get it at any cost. After a lucky meeting with a fellow American (a former war vet who chose to remain living in Thailand rather than return to America) Kurt's hopes of seeking out his revenge are brought to life. At first reluctant, Kurt's new friend eventually introduces him to Zion. A master Martial Artist who has long since retired from training, but he hears Kurt's story, he sees Kurt's passion and sees something Different in Kurt. After a little coaxing and a few rather amusing tests, Zion agrees to train Kurt to take down Tong Po once and for all. At this point the movie takes on a whole new feel again, an often surreal and very serious tone reflecting mans connection with nature, with the past and with the ancient warriors who came before them.I won't go any further in my review, not because it will spoil the ending but because it would spoil everything else in between that leads up to a fantastic Rocky Style finale. It's all those parts in the middle though, all those moments all those genius bits of story that make this movie so worth watching. Oh the ending is good and well worth it but I assure you, watching Kurt train, watching him learn, face his fears and even fall in love. It's all of that, that's what really makes this movie.As a final note which I always live to add to my reviews, watching this film is like watching a Bruce Lee movie or a Chuck Norris film. It's so easy to understand why an entire generation fell in love with martial arts and new generations continue to do so to this day.

Even if his acting to many wasn't all that convincing, his physicality and choreographed fight scenes seemed to have a magnetic attraction to audiences. In between this movie and Bloodsport (1988) were two other movies but seemed to have not gone over well with viewers. It is not until this movie that Van Damme returns to what looks as some of his better performances at the beginning of his career.Like many of his other films to come after or came before, Van Damme plays a character with some kind of a martial arts background. Why - because that's the thing Van Damme had going for him at the time. If you were going to see a Van Damme movie, it was for that reason; his martial arts skills. So in here, it is obvious that he's going to play a kickboxer because that's the title of the film. It's a dead give away. The story is about a trainer (Kurt Sloane), who takes it upon himself to fight for his brother who is permanently injured after challenging an opponent who plays dirty.Playing the injured brother, Eric Sloane, is Dennis Alexio, a real life kickboxer. To be honest, I didn't find his on screen chemistry with Van Damme to be very convincing. It is explained to why they don't sound like brothers but it still sounds far-fetched. Making them close stepbrothers I think would have made things much easier and more believable. But as for characters, that's really the only weak link I found for that particular area. For Kurt, he must learn how to fight like the opponent who hurt is brother. The only way he'll be able to do that, is by being trained like the opponent.The person to do that is Xian Chow (Dennis Chan), an old hermit who looks old but still packs quite a punch. To be brought to Chow, Kurt befriends a man named Winston Taylor (Haskell V. Anderson III), an ex- marine from the Vietnam War, now living in what he calls paradise. Anderson's character is partially the reason why this movie deserves to be seen. The early Van Damme films seem to contain the most comical characters. Also let's not forget the obligatory love interest that falls for Kurt Sloane, which doesn't bother me in the least. I understand that these kind of films need one because what would they be without? The love interest is Chow's niece, Mylee, played by Rochelle Ashana.Let's also not forget the opponent who plays dirty. Tong Po (Michel Qissi) does a good job at making his character look like a jerk. Not only does he get away with several actions that are considered over the top brutal or disgraceful, he also has connections to crime bosses. Hmmm, doesn't sound very good. However this does dilute the character. If you look at Chong Li from Bloodsport (1988), he too was a mean and dirty fighter, but he had no connections. He was just in it for himself. With Tong Po, it's just another clich√© - that every antagonist is connected with some crime lord.There's only one other thing I found to be unnecessary. At one point, Chow gets Kurt drunk and asks him to start dancing. Yeah,...I know there's a point to it in the end of that scene but it really isn't needed. I didn't choose this movie to see Jean-Claude Van Damme dance. No thanks. However, the fight scenes were cool and it was good to see composer Paul Hertzog return to make the score for the film, even if it wasn't as present like his score from Bloodsport (1988). Other than that I was relatively pleased with the outcome of the film.It is a little more clich√© ridden than needed but it still works as a Van Damme sport film. The fight scenes as well as the characters are worth a watch.

He's Taiwan's heavyweight champion and is feared/praised by fight fans as the best. Tong Po makes mincemeat out of American Kickboxing Champion, Eric Sloane(Dennis Alexio), leaving him a paralyzed cripple in a wheelchair, and his brother, Kurt(JCVD)wants revenge. Kurt seeks the assistance of expert master of the martial arts, Xian Chow(the charming Dennis Chan), hoping he will train him to be a great fighter, with the appropriate skills to combat Tong Po. Xian, utilizing Kurt's determination and dedication, molds and develops him into a superior martial artist, but can he withstand the attack of Tong Po? Tong Po's agent, Freddy Li(Ka Ting Lee), uses treacherous antics(..like kidnapping Eric, having Xian's trusty canine stabbed by a dagger, and the rape of Kurt's girlfriend, Mylee(Rochelle Ashana)at the hands of Tong Po)in an attempt to thwart Kurt's chances of defeating his foe due to a lack of focus and concentration, factors needed to properly fight. Freddy Li has made a big bet on Tong Po and informs Kurt that if he is to see his brother alive again he'll throw the bout, but do so while being pummeled by Tong Po. Through the collective efforts of his friends, including Xian and a retired Vietnam vet, Winston(Haskell V Anderson III), perhaps Kurt will be able to fulfill his desire for revenge, while successfully proving that he can be a fighter of superior skill.I feel like many fans of movies regarding kick-boxing will find this a tad disappointing for Kickboxer features precious few fight sequences of real worth. We see Kong Po annihilate Eric in a bout(..before this, Eric himself defeats an American opponent with relative ease, and being a renowned fighter in the USA has grown his ego to epic proportions)establishing the meat of the film's revenge story, but the bulk of Kickboxer has Kurt training with Xian in preparation for Tong Po. We see Kurt and Mylee's blossoming love, along with Freddy Li's shenanigans. The training regimen(..including their work in the fantastic Stone City, an ancient Buddhist temple ruins and around Xian's modest home where he uses natural objects as tools to train Kurt)envelopes a good 50 minutes of the movie. We do see a humorous scene where Xian wishes to challenge Kurt by taking him to a bar, getting him liquored up, and having Freddy Li's young fighters engage him in combat..to the chagrin of Li, Kurt obliterates them in short order, afterward showing that he can barely walk upright! As is often the case with these movies featuring Van Damme(or part of this burgeoning genre of this time when martial arts was starting to take off with western audiences), Tong Po is a muscled and mean force to be reckoned with, an intimidating enemy the hero must overcome through the use of his evolved techniques and physical development. Oftenin these flicks, we see how Xian, the trainer, is able to fashion Kurt mind, body, and soul into a superior fighter. The finale, I think, is sufficiently thrilling as Kurt, at first, must allow Tong Po an advantage, while also remaining distracted due to his brother's whereabouts and discovering Mylee was raped by his opponent. And, just as usual(..we wouldn't expect anything otherwise, would we?)Van Damme gains the upper hand when those encumbrances are lifted and he can take control. Kickboxer is a chance to see Van Damme in full form, landing every type of kick and punch in his arsenal..in slow motion or repeated two or three times to relive the blows as they deplete Tong Po until he's a broken, beaten, and bloody mass, without fight left in him. The martial arts Kurt is learning from Xian is Muay-Thai. I don't think Van Damme has ever looked better than he does here. As normal, JCVD performs the splits numerous times(..this time, there's a scene where his legs are pulled apart by Xian by ropes with sound effects featuring bone cracking).

And it shows. So he was a never a prize fighter, so what? True martial arts is not about fighting, it's a mental/physical discipline, akin to religion in that to truly understand it you must devote yourself to it entirely.The revenge story is run of the mill but cool - Kurt's bro gets paralysed in the ring by the nasty Thai champion (and quite intimidating character) Tong Po, so Kurt, an inexperienced martial artist, seeks training from an old master so he can return and defeat Tong Po in an honorable, though brutal, underground kickboxing contest in Thailand.The real gem of this film is the second act, where Kurt trains in the jungle with the master Xian Chow. It shows some pretty full-on and very interesting scenes of harsh training, both mental and physical, and the forest setting is great. This part actually inspired me to pursue more intensely the martial art I was studying at the time, Arnis (bamboo stick fighting - originated in the Phillippines). Never did I think I would be inspired to better myself by a dumb action movie. Inspiration can come from the strangest of places.The romantic subplot is aided by a nice performance from Rochelle Ashana as Mylee, she is very pretty and a decent actress. Xian Chow (Dennis Chan) is also very good as the wise master.Can't help but mention the dance scene...it really is best experienced rather than described...The final fight is one of the best pre-CGI fight scenes ever put on film. At first it appears like a Rocky-style champ gets pounded by bad buy for 9 rounds then makes a startling comeback at the end but it is far more, and that makes it so memorable. If you haven't seen it just watch it don't read on. If you have...how cool is it? Kurt knows he can k*ck Tong Po from the second he walks in the ring. Kurt has trained like the warriors of old, while Tong Po is really nothing more than a very strong street fighter. The agony is palpable as Kurt knows he has to throw the fight...but as soon as he knows his bro is safe, his girl is safe...the gloves come off...the fear shows in Tong Po...and from that first kick to the head it's all over in great Van Damme style for the Thailand's Tiger!

Today it seems seriously dated and let's face it, downright hokey at times, like with that very embarrassing dance sequence Van Damme does at the Thai saloon. I wonder what he'd have to say about that today.The main problem that I think most martial arts movie fans will acknowledge is that the story is formulaically clich√©d. The revenge motive is ever present in these types of films, and the outcome is always the same - the hero wins, the villain loses. Sometimes the path to getting there is made interesting with a grueling training regimen and humorous elements introduced by a stoic trainer who's comic timing leads to some funny moments. You have some of that here, but it's counterbalanced by Kurt Sloane (Van Damme) whacking his leg against a palm tree full force (impossible) into a bloody pulp, and training immediately after with no visible bruising.And after all that, I don't believe Kurt used any Muay Thai in his match against Tong Po (Michel Quissi). I could be wrong on that score, but not invested enough to re-watch the fight. Going back those couple of decades, I can't remember if this was the first Van Damme flick I ever saw or Bloodsport.

We'll both be better off.Kickboxer (1989) was definitely one of my favorite best action street fight martial arts movie from Jean-Claude Van Damme. It Is still today one of my favorite Van Damme movies and I love it, when ever time I see it. I think it is one of Van Damme's best movie he ever did. It is a good decent movie that remain a cult classic film today. I love the training sequences and the fights. Pretty awesome decent action Van Damme's flick. I love this one. As far as the sequels, I don't mind them. Initially I was mad because they just flat out killed the characters from the first movie. But over time I got over it and enjoyed them for the low budget fighting movies they are. Both the original Kickboxer and Bloodsport are by far the best in their series, but Kickboxer's sequels are far better than the Bloodsport sequels. I don't care how good of a martial artist Daniel Bernhardt is.Pronounced Kee see. One of the things I never knew about Kickboxer was Dennis Alexio's voice was dubbed over. I think there's a clip on YouTube of his original voice during a hospital scene. Even tough it is one of my favorite JCVD films, I think it is his best film, alongside with Bloodsport, Lionheart, Death Warrant, Hard Target, Universal Soldier, Timecop, Sudden Death and Maximum Risk over this movie. The problem with this film I have is The style Van Damme performs throughout the movie is not Muay Thai, just some sort of low karate actionsÔªø. When his character was learning Muay Thai, Van Damme could at least performed that. I felt like van Damme taught his self, Typical martial arts movie. In here Van Damme to me already knew all martial arts from Karate and his brother being hurt was the trigger I just feel mixed on this one. I liked the fights and training sequences but that is it all. Dennis Chan (Xian) is a Hong Kong film actor mostly known for comedic roles so he's definitely no martial arts master. I think Streets of Siam is up there with Fight to Survive. I felt like there was really no kickboxing in the film and always wondered Why is it called Kickboxer when there really isn't any kickboxing in it? It could've been call Master Fighter or something. The reason why Van Damme fights were so fluent in Knock Off was because that movie had Hong Kong action choreographers, as did Double Team and No Retreat No Surrender. I think this movie is a good typical 80's late film, not my cup of tea or the best in the genre.The movie get's 10, by me the training sequences and the music score where awesome. The final fight on the end, between Kurt Sloan and Tong Po was good, only because of the music score. I wanted to point that out, I like it, but not love it. Even as a child when I first time saw it, I did not like it unlike I loved Bloodsport! However I do enjoyed and I love it today. The songs performed by Stan Bush The Streets of Siam and Fight for Love. Without those songs I would not like this movie, just my opinion. The Last thing In my opinion Michel Qissi is very underrated actor and he did a terrific job playing the Villain in here, I am glad that he did return in the sequel and that he played in Bloodsport and Lionheart! I love those two movies to death! Rochelle Ashana was also good playing Mylee, Xian Chow's niece. Haskell V. Anderson III as Winston Taylor former Vietnam Vet was also great in this movie. I liked his performance of playing his character. The last of the actor that I liked was Dennis Alexio he was a real life the greatest heavyweight kick boxing champion in the sport's history. He's fighting performance is the real kickboxing style unlike Van Damme's. I am hearing they are remaking this movie with Van Damme as a master in that movie.

I last saw Kickboxer when I was 11 years old and I hadn't seen the movie in 20 years. Thankfully, the movie was still enjoyable and like a vintage wine you can still enjoy it with age. Kickboxer also showcased Van Damme's spectacular martial arts prowess and he does it with style.Kurt Sloane (Jean-Claude Van Damme) acts as cornerman and trainer for his older brother Eric (Dennis Alexio), an US kickboxing champion. Kurt and Eric travel to Bangkok, Thailand to challenge Tong Po (Michel Qissi), Thailand's undefeated powerhouse champion who ruthlessly pummels his opponents in the ring. Ignoring all of Kurt's warnings to pull out of the match, Eric remains proudly adamant that he is not going to back down from Tong Po in the ring. Kurt helplessly watches Tong Po brutally beat Eric in the ring and leaves him paralysed from the waist down, wheelchair bound and unable to walk again. Filled with grief and rage, Kurt swears revenge on Tong Po. Kurt finds a sole ally in Winston Taylor (Haskell Anderson), a retired US Army special forces soldier who helps Kurt enlist the help of a former Muay Thai trainer Xian Chow (Dennis Chan) who lives in seclusion in a quiet village along with his niece Mylee (Rochelle Ashana). Though reluctant at first, Xian teaches Kurt the ways of Muay Thai with primitive but extremely effective methods to transform Kurt into a hardened fighter primed to avenge his older brother by fighting Tong Po. The acting was never going to set the world on fire but there is no doubt Kickboxer is still exciting and enjoyable from start to finish. The fighting and martial arts showcased on screen are still a delight to watch many years later. Jean-Claude Van Damme in his halcyon days is still enjoyable to watch on screen. Though Van Damme's star has since faded and he is no longer the box office drawcard he used to be, a lot of his early movies still have a special spot in all of our hearts.Kickboxer is vintage Van Damme doing what he does best.

The film has some very good comedic moments as well, mostly coming from Xian and Winston (and the old guy sitting outside of mylee's store). In terms of a remake staring Dave Bautista and Gorge ST Pierre I find a silly idea because if it is a straight up remake it will make no sense. Bautista looks nothing like Tong Po and if the rumours are true that George ST Pierre is playing Kurt, the size difference between the two is ridiculous.

He and little brother Kurt (Jean-Claude Van Damme) go to Bangkok to destroy the local talents. Only the Thai champion Tiger Tong Po breaks Eric's back and paralyzes him. With the help of Taylor, an American living locally, Kurt becomes a student under master Xian. He trains to face the powerful Tong Po himself, and falls in love with a local.This hits the trifecta of fight action B-movie. It's got cheesy acting, exotic locations, and an eastern fighting style. The music is full on 80s cheese. Van Damme does a reasonable job acting. The fights are a little bit disappointing. It's staged by experts but it needs experts to film it properly. Michel Qissi is a great villain in this. This is a B-movie that is better than most.

I had Kickboxer in my TiVo but chose to watch the sequel first. You can see why if you go to my review of that movie. And I saw the second sequel before this one as well.Did it help to see the second one first? Certain details were less of a shock. However, the brother in the other movies in the series did not exist or was unknown to the brothers in this movie. And something else was inconsistent between this movie and the sequel. But I can't say what that was because it would be a major spoiler. Let's just say I was dreading the ending of this movie but it was much more satisfying than I had thought it would be. A term used on the CW Smallville message boards was Offscreenville. Perhaps something happened offscreen between the two movies. You watch Jean Claude Van Damme movies to see him fight. You do not watch them to see him act. He did smile a lot in some scenes with his brother. He almost never smiles. So here, he seems to have a more pleasant personality, at least in a few scenes, than what I am used to.Van Damme is shown as the director of fight scenes. I don't know precisely how you direct yourself, but Van Damme knows what he is doing. And all the fighting is really good.As was the case in the sequels, Dennis Chan does a very good job as trainer Xian. And there is a lot of comedy, though not nearly as much as in the third movie. The training here reminded me a lot of the training in the sequel very tough, sometimes funny. Xian would not let Kurt give up.Haskell Anderson is quite good as the man who gives Kurt and Eric so much help.I'm not sure why Michel Qissi was shown in the credits as Tong Po, but whatever his real name is he is quite fierce without saying a word, and terrifying when he does speak the one time.Rochelle Asana is simply adorable as Xian's niece who ran the village store.I am curious about how Xian knew Kurt was American. Kurt's accent, of course, is explained when he says his parents divorced and he was raised by his mother in Belgium and his father stayed with Eric in the U.S. Eric has an ethnic look, though, which is never explained.Is this a good movie? Maybe. It's no Rocky, that's for sure. But it's not bad.

Pretending to be the naive younger brother of a far superior kick boxing champ, the action hero, known for his abundant ego, plays humble to the max. His big bro (Dennis Alexio) is crippled in a seedy backroom bout in Muay Tai by villainous rival Tong Po, a mohawked villain who plays tribal music as he circles his prey. Van Damme, aided by an African American Vietnam Vet, seeks training from a wise old sage and &#x96; like KUNG FU and KILL BILL 2 &#x96; the revenge-driven student goes through a torturous training session at a rural outpost, learning a method of kickboxing that you can't get anywhere else.This takes up most of the film, including terrific montage scenes as Van Damme gains strength, agile, and wisdom. And when the local mob moves in, the student proves his worth to protect a local love-interest. The exterior locations are beautiful and the fight scenes occur sporadically enough to appease hardcore action fans. There's a significant story-arc as Van Damme morphs from lamb to lion, and it's not easy. Especially after the bad guys kidnap his wheelchair-bound brother and Van Damme must survive the final match with Tong Po, while the side characters, never resorted to filler status, need to pull off a last minute rescue for our hero to turn the tables in the ring &#x96; to win the match and to save his life.For More Reviews www.cultfilmfreaks.com "},{"Title":"Kickboxer - review","Date":"27 December 2011","Score":"","Genre":"Action, Sport","Review":" Without going into too much detail, Kickboxer follows the same formula as Rocky IV and, to a lesser extent, the other Rocky pictures and the Karate Kid films. Yet I found this film to be a lot of fun despite its predictability. Jean Claude Van Damme (playing the hero Kurt Sloan) is not a great actor, but his youthful exuberance, cheerful demeanour, and dashing appearance make him a very likable hero nonetheless. In addition, Van Damme is also not held back as much as in his later films when he goes through the indignity of saying fewer lines than the supporting cast. For me, the decision not to hold Van Damme back is a good one, because a hero can never hold our interest unless he has a well defined character to go along with his martial arts moves. Yet the best character in Kickboxer has to be Xian Chow (Dennis Chan) who trains Van Damme for his big fight with Tong Po (Michel Qissi). Xian Chow was obviously modelled after Mr. Miyagi from the Karate Kid movies, but his character has a few fresh elements. To begin with, Dennis Chan projects a dry sense of humour, like when he explains to Kurt Sloan why it is unwise to train a stranger in the art of Muay Thai. This movie was sold on its martial arts sequences, but the truth of the matter is that Dennis Chan steals the show whenever he performs on screen.The rest of Kickboxer consists of Van Damme's Kurt Sloan going through intensive training against a gorgeous backdrop of Thai architecture and great 1980s music, which is just as well since training sequences in an exotic martial arts form and amidst Ancient Thai architecture are reliably entertaining. This film, especially its training sequences, also has a subtle statement to make on life which was very much in keeping with the spirit of the 1980s. This statement, simply expressed, is that the route to success and lasting happiness is to suppress troubling emotions, pull yourself up by your bootstraps, and work incredibly hard to overcome adversity. Those people who fail to overcome adversity in this way only have themselves to blame.

He is a simple soul at heart ready to give a helping hand.Now about the film Kurt Sloan is the corner-man for his brother, U.S. kickboxing champion Eric Sloan. Eric has his next match in Thailand against an opponent he knows nothing about. He doesn't even know the art of Muay Thai his opponent Tong Po is a master of this deadly art.Before the fight Eric asks Kurt to fetch himself some ice to cool of his body. As Kurt is returning with some ice in some pails he hears some dull thuds and catches first glimpse of Tong Po who is hitting the support pillars of his room with his legs bringing pieces of the ceiling plaster down to the floor much to the shock of Kurt. He pleads to Eric to stop the fight. Eric tells Kurt to have faith in his his abilities.During the fight Eric is punished and paralyzed in the ring by and elbow to the back by Thailand champion Tong Po. When Kurt tries to intervene he is given a kick to the chest and throw out of the ring, where he is noticed by Winston Taylor a retired Vietnam War veteran. Eric is dumped outside by attendants much to the disbelief of Kurt and left there without even arrangements being made to take him to hospital. Winston Taylor arrives at the scene and he and Kurt take Eric to the hospital where he is later diagnosed as being paralyzed waist down as a result of the injury by Tong Po.He vows revenge against all of Winston's arguments that Tong Po is owned by a vicious crime lord, and that a direct attack on him would mean their deaths. Kurt's only chance is in the ring and that without any training it would mean his doom.Kurt tries to enroll in a Muay Thai school but is refused many times. Eventually Winston who has been watching him all the time tells him that he knows an old friend called Zion who could tutor him. With the help of Zion Kurt begins his first steps in the art of Muay Thai, and the eventual showdown between him and Tong Po.

Jean Cloud stars as Luc 'kickboxer' Deveroux, a fighter who wants to travel to China and enter a deadly Marshall Arts contest. His brother, Luke Deveroux was meant to go but as he was an unknown actor they decided to send Vin Darn instead. Off he goes, wearing nothing as always to make sure the female, gay, and curious portion of the audience get to drool over his well oiled, muscular and inviting buttocks. Soon he is being trained by a wizened old genius in the ways of kick boxing. He kicks empty cardboard boxes, flat packs, dodges boxes filled with ripe fruit and veg, and eats cardboard all day. The middle section of the film is simply various montages of this type of behaviour, showing his skills improving until he can do the splits balancing on top of a hundred stacked milk cartons. We also see him shaking his thang at a local bar, entrancing the local woman and igniting them into a sexual frenzy. Luckily when they approach he snaps their necks with swift roundhouse kicks. Thus he is ready for the tournament. Many fighters from around the globe and beyond have come to fight and win. We have Bolo from China, a sumo wrestler from Japan, a Viking from Norway, a funny little crab like creature from Africa, and various others, each with a unique fighting style. Shaun Claw Damn Van progresses through each round, beating everyone easily. In the final he has to fight a hard looking transvestite who trains by kicking holes in car doors and eating concrete. JCVCDVD beats him after a gruelling ten rounds by punching him in the nuts so hard that she/he becomes a he/she.

Street Fighter II was huge! Ninja Turtles was still booming and there was a big martial arts craze going on at the time. So there was nothing cooler than renting an R-rated Van Damme movie! Kickboxer comes from a long line of classics that spawned from the 80s and early 90s. It was truly a great time for movies and Hollywood had not yet burned itself out like it has today.For this film, Van Damme is in full form fresh from his breakthrough performance in Bloodsport. This time around, the plot is that of classic martial arts revenge and even more cool training. The best thing about this type of movie is that it doesn't try to be anything more than it already IS, and for that it truly succeeds. Van Damme demonstrates his classic (long forgotten) charisma that once made him a mega-star. Not because he was an amazing actor, but because he had so much HEART.The fight scenes are some of the best ever filmed. Van Damme really shows off his impressive physique and his unique martial arts form this time around. Nothing was cooler than Van Damme‚Äôs famous air born spin kicks.Kickboxer is not perfect, but it is very enjoyable and is always a big reminder of how cool these types of movies used to be before both Hollywood and Van Damme sadly burned themselves out.Awesome movie!! 8 out of 10 Classic!

His older brother gets in a fight with a real bad guy, so it's up to Jean-Claude to save the day!!Even though he can act, despite popular belief (Replicant, Maximum Risk, In Hell) he doesn't concentrate on that here. He just shows us his breathtaking ability to kick down a brick wall with an aerial kick, and how he can, with ease, without bending over at all, kick with both legs well above his own head, with force too. He's not just doing fancy moves that mean nothing in the grand scheme of things.

He made a few movies better than KICKBOXER&#151;and also many far worse&#151;so what I'm saying is that KICKBOXER has a place of pride in his career.Van Damme shows us a very nice persona in this action flick&#151;a nice youngster, set to learn Muai Thai from a master, Xian (Dennis Chan) in order to avenge his brother. This is the plot of tens of action movies; like the vast majority, this one seems drastically low&#151;budgeted, and it's made worth especially by the Asian performers&#151;such as the already mentioned Muai Thai master Dennis Chan, and his niece Rochelle Ashana ('Mylee' in the movie). The master can be funny when he so chooses.Most of the film details Van Damme's training; Xian takes him sometimes to the Stone City, to put him in line with the atmosphere of a place once visited by the ancient warriors. Also, by very harsh methods, Xian teaches Van Damme how to stretch&#151;using things that would make a professional hangman pretty envious. Xian's lesson to Van Damme is that, in order to learn kick-boxing, you have to learn more than just kick-boxing. There's a wider&#151;human&#151;reality. But rest assured&#151;the flick is thoroughly straightforward, you'll be spared lectures of Oriental wisdom.Van Damme's adversary is Tong Po, a Neanderthalian brute, very skilled, very strong, and extremely base&#151;he rapes Mylee before the match.KICKBOXER is a no&#151;nonsense fights flick, leaner than most others.

Eric's brother Kurt isn't happy about the situation & convinces an old Muay expert Xian Chow (Dennis Chan) to teach him the art of kick-boxing so he can gain revenge on Tong for his brother...Kickboxer is one of those rare films which is credited has having three director's, producer Mark DiSalle (who also is listed in the credits as playing a 'U.S. Reporter') & David Worth with a very young looking JCVD credited as 'fight scenes director' as well, I personally have never seen a film where three separate director's are credited during the opening credits, never. It's then perhaps a surprise that Kickboxer turned out as coherent as it did, I'm not saying it's a great film because it's far from a great film & it isn't even particularly good by JCVD standards but it ain't too bad & passes the time harmlessly enough. The by-the-numbers script by Glen Bruce is just so clich√©d & predictable, a man sets out to avenge a family member/friend who has had some sort of injustice inflicted upon them & in that respect Kickboxer is nothing new. Also it's far too predictable, I mean is there really anyone out there who doesn't think that JCVD will defeat Tong Po & avenge his brother? I didn't think so. So what Kickboxer is all about are the fight scenes of which there are not enough, JCVD only fights on four occasions although I admit they are pretty good sequences. The rest of the time is mostly spent watching him get trained by some crazy old Chinese dude in scenes that reminded me of similar ones in The Karate Kid (1984)! It moves along at a reasonable pace & it passes the time but the character's are thin, it's predictable & it's nothing new.Director's DiSalle & Worth do OK with the talky bits while I have to admit JCVD does really well with the fight scenes, the choreography is actually rather impressive with brutal looking fights & kick-boxing scenes. The punches & kicks seem to have impact thanks to them being well staged & clever camera placement & I suppose JCVD's knowledge of martial arts & film-making comes in handy in this respect. Some of the Thai scenery looks quite nice & the early montage of Thai prostitutes & sex shops sets the tone for this lads flick. The violence isn't too strong, it's not overly sadistic or graphic. I was disappointed they didn't make use of the ropes wrapped around their hands with shards of broken glass stuck to them in a scene that is openly parodied in Hot Shots! Part Deux (1993), I mean one punch from those & it would have ripped your opponents skin to shreds.With a modest sounding budget of about $1,500,000 Kickboxer looks alright, the locations look nice enough I suppose & it's competently made. Apparently JCVD got paid $70,000 for this, it certainly wasn't for his acting ability though.Kickboxer is an OK time waster if you like martial arts type films or are a huge JCVD fan, if any still exist. I didn't think it was one of his best but nowhere near his worst, it's just very average predictable middle of the road stuff. Successful enough to spawn four sequels none of which featured JCVD, Kickboxer 2 The Road Back (1991), Kickboxer 3 The Art of War (1992), Kickboxer 4 The Aggressor (1994) & Kickboxer 5 (1995) although they seem to have stopped making them now.

The brother is paralyzed by this champ and the other brother finds a guy to train him so he can defeat this super killer guy who took out the American champ in a few seconds. So the rest of the movie is Jean training to get back at the super kick boxer. The movie is okay, but it has problems too. There is only so much training one can take and this one has those scenes in spades. The super kick boxer in the final fight is a bit weak and that whole fight is a bit anti-climatic. And seriously they just dump the American champ outside after his loss? Why did the American agree to go over there without some sort of backing by the government to take care of him and sanction the fight, just goes to show you never go to an underground like fighting arena to prove yourself. Still, it is a watchable movie just not really my thing, I preferred the tournament of Bloodsport where they had rather big array of fighters.

Some of that stuff is actually pretty badass, like the scene where the usual wise trainer stereotype instructs him to take down a tree, but most of it just feels boring and overlong. The romantic subplot isn't any help either, around halfway I was just hoping they would bring out the fight already. So then they bring out the fight and it's actually quite good, well-choreographed and the climax is set up nicely.

The teacher student relationship and training was interesting, but nothing special compared to similar movie scenarios. Uncle Xian was funny sometimes but in general all of the dialogue was just plain corny. That dancing scene brought the quality level to its lowest. The whole movie lacked intrigue and it had nothing to keep your whole interest or attention. The fight scenes (which is why most people watch these types of movies) were not even that good. The final fight which should have been the pinnacle of the film, was quite a letdown with a low intensity level and mostly consisting of long drawn out yells and tacky moves.

For me, it's not quite possible to dislike a muscular male who gets off his kit once or twice per film. And if that's the sort of thing you're after, you'll be spoilt with Kickboxer, who's lengthy final battle is fought with both brawlers in mere beige loincloths.But onto more serious matters. If ever there was a blatant copy of another film, this is it. The whole thing is almost exactly the same as Bloodsport, right down to the singer who croons out the insert songs. But in Thailand. There's a nasty and brutal local champ who beats up a loved one of Van Damme, his brother this time. Note that, just like in Bloodsport, the beaten-up big bro of Kickboxer is a rather irritating blokey with unsightly facial hair, who's just too full of himself (there's a lesson in there... don't wear a 'tache on a fighting ring, probably). J-C v D goes out for revenge against the mean champion. And this is where the only real difference between Kickboxer and Bloodsport shows; here, Van Damme is still lacking experience in the domain of martial arts, and needs to undergo a long training before he'll stand a chance against the big nasty.This then leads to a big dose of scenes where the Damme-man undergoes harsh and slightly unusual training under an old master. Pretty much 2/3 of the movie are made up of these initiation scenes, and thus it seems like a much more slow and calm film than Bloodsport. It may also seem much more boring than Bloodsport to others, as there is fairly little actual fighting until the end of the film. Just a lot of long scenes where Van Damme strengthens himself, or scenes where we see some pretty Thai scenery. It's not that bad, really, and certainly less dull than it sounds, but this more sedate pace won't work for everyone.In the end, the film does sort of make up for it's lack of zest by throwing in a long and very intense final battle (and the nasty here is a good deal more genuinely evil than Chong Li was in Bloodsport). Thrilling as though the final scene may be, it is sort of hard to believe that the hero could've gone from being a mere beginner to an expert strong enough to beat a highly feared champion so quickly. It somehow doesn't quite feel as if Van Damme has really undergone many months of agonising training, gaining fighting experience...exactly because we haven't seen him fight all that much up to the last (and pretty much only) battle. Where did he get the experience in practise from? Reading a handbook?One thing to point out; the idea in this film is that Jean-Claude, unlike his badly shaven big bro, is the shy and sensitive intello of the two. Okay, so this point is only mentioned very briefly, but it still raises a lot of eyebrows. Jean-Clause Van Damme as the educated wuss in a family is about as plausible as Louis de Fun√®s would be in a Swan Lake ballet (still, who knows...).With it's flawed pace and blatant cloning of Bloodsport, this movie isn't ideal. It's not exactly horrible either, and remains watchable enough, but only total fighting film junkies will really enjoy it. The whole loincloth scene also makes it commendable to fans of male skin-showing (errr...right, brothers?). Others don't really have a reason to check this out.

It was a low-budget film but with a great story line. I think that the title was simply Kick Box.The plot was There are two brothers. One brother is the World Champion Kick Boxer. However, in a fight to defend the world championship, he is severely injured. He is put in a wheel-chair and cannot box any more.His brother wants to gain revenge, so he goes looking for a grandmaster to teach him Thai kick boxing. After a long search, he finds the Grandmaster of Kick Boxing living as a recluse far out in the jungles of Thailand. At first the grandmaster denies that he is the right person. Then he says that he does not box any more. Finally with great reluctance he agrees to teach him kick boxing.There follows months of rigorous training. Finally the brother decides he is ready and leaves.We soon find out why the grandmaster was so reluctant to box any more, even denying who he was. The same boxer who severely injured the brother has been searching for the grandmaster too. He finally finds him in the jungle, they fight and the grandmaster is killed. The brother returns to find his teacher dead. Now the brother goes searching to gain revenge against the kick boxer who both injured his brother and killed his teacher.I finally got around to seeing this movie today in DVD format. However, there were major, major changes from the original version I saw as an in-flight movie on Thai International Airways. The changes are so big that it is almost a different movie. Here are some of the changes The Viet Nam War veteran Winston Taylor part does not exist in the original. There is no such person.The female lead MyLee does not exist in the original.The only female in the original is the hooker who the elder brother is taking into a hotel. The hooker in the original is a different girl and more beautiful.All or almost all of the actors are different. The bad guy Tong Po is a different actor in the original. In the original, that part is played by a very mean looking black man. He kills three people unnecessarily, and is killed himself in the end.The trainer in the original is a different actor. He is a much younger man who merely wants to retire from fighting, so at first he pretends not to be that person. We later learn that he is hiding from the Tong Po character who wants to hunt him down, kind of like in the old western movies where the two fastest gunslingers in the west want to battle each other to see who is the fastest.The final fight scene does not take place in an arena in front of a paying audience. Rather, the final fight takes place in the jungle and it is a fight to the death.With all these changes, one must wonder if it is really the same movie. Yet, it is clearly the same. The earlier part up to the point where the defeated and injured elder brother is taken out and left on the street is virtually identical to the in-flight movie I saw.The movie I saw was very primitive. It looked like it had been shot with a home movie camera. What I suspect is that some Hollywood producers saw the original I saw, realized its potential and purchased the rights and remade the movie completely.I still prefer the original. Perhaps they should go back and find the original if it still exists and remake THAT movie.Sam Sloan "}{"Title":"A movie for those who like the bargain basement deals.","Date":"15 November 2003","Score":"0 out of 4 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Sport","Review":"  Before I start this movie review on Kickboxer, I would like to say that  there would be no way in which I would watch a Van Damme movie, unless I was getting paid.
