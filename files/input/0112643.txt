[{"Title":"Surprisingly good","Date":"3 April 2005","Score":"28 out of 32 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama, Horror, Mystery","Review":" I really didn't expect much when I picked this movie up, considering its pedigree (a Full Moon low-budget picture shot in Italy). What a pleasure then that this turned out much better than expected. Good use is made of the Italian locations, especially the castle, and Stuart Gordon uses many cool angles to keep things interesting. Reputation has him as an over-the-top-gore director, but this doesn't do him full justice. He is also good in building atmosphere, and this is Castle Freak's biggest asset. The gore is relatively minimal, and instead of indulging us with gore, he goes for a dark and tragic atmosphere, convincingly combining a traumatized family and a mistreated, misunderstood monster in the Frankenstein-tradition. This means that despite reuniting the Gordon-Combs-Crampton triumvirate Re-Animator-Fans should beware this one is played strictly as drama/tragedy with not a single laugh in sight. The screenplay is well-developed with convincing characters and reasonably good dialogue. Nothing that is Academy Award-material, but who'd expect that from a movie called Castle Freak? Acting is also spot on, especially Jeffrey Combs in a straight man role (for once). While it would go to far to call this a lost genre classic, it deserves to be seen by more people than probably did. If you're a genre fan, give Castle Freak a chance. It might just win you over, like it did with me.

Gordon takes this simple plot(slightly based in The Outsider) and adds depth to Combs character and his family he killed his 6 years old son in a car accident while driving drunk. This event has marked his family, destroying his relationship with his wife Susan(Barbara Crampton) and his daughter Rebecca(Jessica Dollarhide), who was blinded in the accident.All this conflicts explode in the castle when a prostitute brought by John appears brutally killed in a savage way, and all the clues point to John; who now not only must prove himself innocent, but also must save his family from the mysterious being who lurks in the castle.Jeffrey Combs and Barbara Crampton give one of their best performances. Crampton's Susan Reilly is truly believable as a mother who has lost a child and blames his former lover of everything that goes wrong in her life; while Combs shines as the man overwhelmed by guilt who must face his own demons to gain the strength to save his family.Gordon's direction is remarkable, as he manages to keep a Gothic atmosphere while making the film shocking by including a few extremely graphic gory scenes. Makes a nice contrast that many have attempted but very few manage to achieve.The make-up is outstanding and very realistic, there was a lot of heart in the production of the horrifying scenes. A true love for the horror genre.The movie does not disappoint and flows smoothly from the beginning to the end, it never gets boring and the script is really well constructed. While the movie may not be exactly Lovecraft's story, it still has that spirit mixed with that visual style of Gordon that has given us jewels such as the previously mentioned Re-Animator, and the awesome Dagon.While this is not as good as those 2 movies, it still stands as one of the best horror movies of the 90's, keeping that soul that 70's & 80's horror films used to have.Very recommended for fans of the genre. 8/10 "},{"Title":"True horror","Date":"23 February 1999","Score":"21 out of 29 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama, Horror, Mystery","Review":"  This was a surprise from Full Moon.

After his caretaker sh!ts the bed, poor ole C.F. is left alone. Luckily for him, Jeffrey Coombs and his family (hot mom and hot blind daughter, by the way, say no more) inherit this mammoth castle. Eventually C.F. gets loose and unfortunately he doesn't know how to control himself. You tend to feel bad for C.F. in the movie, so when he does kill (spoiler maybe?....shut up!) you really don't care. But I connected and cared for him most was when he had trouble with members of the opposite sex. Definitely the top scenes of this flick. The acting was surprisingly efficient. You have B movie actor extrodinaire Jeffrey Coombs play the dad in a really great role. I was expecting his trademark expressions, but instead of the close ups, they focused more on his tone of voice and the scene. Which really helped the film and acting. The others all played the roles very well, no complaints. If you're complaining about this movie's acting you need your head checked....it's a Direct-to-Video film. It was definitely a surprise to me....and most likely it'll be a surprise to you....the horror fan.I give it around a 7 1/2.....like I said it wasn't great.

Some pretty gory scenes featuring nudity with gore, dismemberment and mutilation for those who are into that sort of thing.The movie had a low budget feel to it, which many horror/gore fans are into, but regardless, the creature looked pretty realistic and disfigured. My complaint with the creature is that when you are disfigured, handicapped and starved nearly to death, that would weaken you. It seemed to make this a superhuman disfigured person who can jump out of second story windows and still run to catch up to it's victim. He wouldn't be so quiet either, at least in his case.It took nearly an hour for the movie to fully get going with the horror after the build up, but it turned into a pretty decent effort.

If he gets loose, the family's heritage may become one of pure carnage.Stuart Gordon (Re-Animator) directs this film with a cast consisting of Jeffrey Combs (Re-Animator) and Barbra Crampton (Re-Animator), produced by Charles Band (Re-Animator). Maybe you've caught on, but this is something of a Re-Animator reunion... with a few people missing. And a much lower production value (the film quality looks like 1970s issue or something from PBS during British comedy hour). For the most part, this is pretty solid film.Combs is quite good, and one wonders why he's not given leading roles more often. Crampton is also good, and the blind girl (Jessica Dollarhide, in her only feature film) was remarkable. The freak? I have to say the makeup, effects and even the mannerisms were impressive. There's a scene where a prostitute meets her end... and they really went out of their way to show how horrific the freak could be.The story isn't fast-paced or action-packed, so if you need to be constantly entertained, this may not be for you.

The scare factor is present and works in the right moments. The haunted mansion elements are effective and with the presence of a deformed killer,  the movie gets a strong 80's horror movie feeling. The atmosphere is dark as the castle is big and creepy. Too bad that only few places in the castle were used.  The acting is pretty good here for being a mid 90's direct to video horror film from Full Moon Pictures. Jeffrey Combs (John Reilly) delivers a solid and believable performance (expect when he's drunk). He carries the film on his back and delivers. Barbara Crampton (Susan Reilly) gives a good performance but her cute face and pretty looks makes difficult to believe that she can survive the situations.  Jessica Dollarhide (Rebecca Reilly) is good at the blind daughter character (not to mention that she's hot).  Girgio the horrible freak is just o.k.  About the Giorgio character, it depends on your point of view to label him as villain, victim, misunderstood being, or retarded person.Giorgio lost contact with the real world for 40 years, he didn't perfection his 5 senses and his body grew deformed. He obviously was a victim of his crazed mother. It wasn't his fault to act like a wild, nonsense animal when he escaped. In fact, his intention wasn't to kill he just copied human behaviors and acted in self-defense when attacked. For example, when he enters Rebeca's room he looked for a blanked to cover from the cold, I didn't see any intentions to have sex with her. I can't talk about his sexual needs as it's shown that his mother castrated him. His sexual instinct  was repressed and it seemed to cause him emotional disorders as he couldn't satisfy it. But that's not the main point of the movie. He's portrayed as the killer and that's what it matters.The make-up is also pretty good; Giorgio looks gross and scary at some times and the gore scenes look pretty gruesome. The prostitute's death is the highlight of the movie as it's extremely graphic and gruesome. It has somewhat generated an opinion in almost every horror fan that watches this film. I found it disturbing but pleasant for the gore genre. The scene is one of the most memorable gory deaths from any movie in the 90's. The score didn't work, a movie with this atmsophere and plot needed a more chilling score. Stuart Gordon's direction isn't something you've never seen, it's just decent.  I like the 80's horror feeling in this movie combined with the dramatic tones. At the ending even that John failed as a husband and father, he managed to save his family from death. The chasing scene at the ending is thrilling, unlike the final confrontation with the freak who deserved a better death. Still, the ending pleases the viewer as the main hero and the villain die at the same time.  Susan forgives him for J.J.'s death, his alcoholism, and his unfaithful after he dies.  Nice dramatic touch in a horror film. I'd recommend this film to any horror fan, it delivers expectations. But watch the director's un cut version, that's the one that worths the watch.

This is considered by many to be a complete failure on many levels, but good delivery of bad material and some very gory moments give fans a run for their money.Combs and Crampton are grieving parents after a car accident leaves their son killed and their daughter blinded. She can't seem to forgive the distraught dad for being intoxicated behind the wheel when it happened, which leaves the plot open for Comb's inevitable redemption. Sooner if not later, the family inherits a castle in Rome, and unfortunately, they also inherit the hideously deformed and tortured man chained up in the basement. After eating a cat, the freak gains enough strength to break his chains and go on a rampage after anyone found in the castle. Its pretty tasteless stuff as the completely naked creature bites a prostitute to death, tears out the throats of policemen and other sorts of gory mayhem, meanwhile the blind daughter and Combs are the only people convinced that there is someone else in the castle.This is a dingy looking movie that fails to provide mood or ambiance short of trying pretty hard. Combs and Crampton are now pros at what they do considering the material that they're given. The creature is more amusing than scary, but gore fans will be pleased with the overall gruesomeness. Too bad Full Moon Pictures didn't end their stay with a better bad movie, but left audiences in the rain with just plain bad instead.

It is certainly not Gordon's best movie (his absolute masterpiece is Re-Animator, with From Beyond as a close second), but it nevertheless is a highly atmospheric and unusual Horror film, and especially worth watching as the 1990s were a more than poor decade for Horror in which good horror films, such as this one, were rare. The film takes place in the homeland of great Horror, namely Bella Italia, where it is excellently set in an eerie old castle. John and Susan Reilly, a troubled married couple, have inherited the castle, and come to Italy with their blind daughter in order to take a look at their inheritance. The Reillys soon have to realize that their marital disputes are not their only trouble in their creepy new home... Gordon's regular star, the great Jeffrey Combs who is without doubt one of the greatest Horror actors of his generation, stars as John Reilly, the family father, and he is great in the role. His fellow Re-Animator cast member, the beautiful Barbara Crampton is very good as the wife. Jonathan Fuller is also very good. The film is creepy and highly atmospheric throughout and has many highly intense moments. Castles are always a great setting for Horror films, in my opinion, and this one is particularly eerie. This certainly isn't one of Stuart Gordon's best, but there is no doubt that it outshines most other Horror productions from the mid 90s. As far as I am concerned, Castle Freak doesn't reach the brilliance of Re-Animator, but it is definitely a creepy, highly atmospheric and original, above average example of good 90s Horror.

This abuse derives from what her American soldier husband did to her, leaving the duchess for her sister. This adulterous couple bore John who is carrying some personal demons that torment him so. John, who was an alcoholic, was responsible for a car wreck which killed his son and left his daughter with damaged, blinded eyes. His wife, Susan(Barbara Crampton)hates him, but has traveled(with their daughter Rebecca portrayed by Jessica Dollarhide)with him to the castle. I'm guessing that Susan has remained married to John for the sake of their daughter who would be crushed by a divorce. But, what John doesn't understand is that the brutalized man is still down in the prison tomb and now resembles a monster. He is able to free a hand from a shackle when he breaks off his thumb(Ouch!)and remove the door that has closed him in for decades. Able to roam free, the monster(Jonathan Fuller, under a latex suit and heavy make-up)takes a liking to Rebecca, but remains hidden in the 150-room castle often watching the others from behind furniture, sheets, etc. The monster has a massive gash on his mouth and chin which may've resulted to a severe gash from the whip his mother often bludgeoned him with. John really wants to make his marriage work again, but Susan's suffering is too overwhelming for any form of forgiveness..he was driving drunk and because of that their son is dead and daughter blind. When John finds his marriage at the peak of disaster with Susan pretty much stating she wished he had dies in that wreck instead of coming away without a scratch, he heads for the bar and finds a prostitute only eager to take his cash. Drunk and sneaking the prostitute in the castle unbeknown est to his wife and daughter, John realizes after a little graphic foreplay that he is making a mistake and stops. The prostitute, however, doesn't make it out of the castle..the castle freak wants to have a little foreplay. When his advancements are turned away in horror at his grotesqueness, the freak will eat..her! John was the last to see her alive and will face possible murder charges which only grow worse when the freak kills the cook/maid(Elisabeth Kaza)as well.Really well made horror item during Stuart Gordon's tenure with Charles Band's Full Moon Pictures. Good, creepy setting for the freak to run rampant. One might feel some sympathy for this freak because the only reason he is acting so monstrous is because of decades of torture and abuse. The idea of having that created freak opposite a tormented Jeffrey Combs(..playing the most normal character I can think of to date)dealing with guilt over the trauma he has caused his family gives this a lot of serious clout. One thing missing from this creature feature often seen in most of Stuart Gordon's work is the humorous bits. This is a very serious picture and there's just not much room for laughter. These characters are dying inside..one's a freak on the inside(Combs), the other is on the outside(Fuller). The photography, music, performances are all first-rate..everyone did a commendable job. Despite Gordon's various ways of clothing the freak in darkness, at times he just looks like a man in latex. Still, Gordon does frame him in some gruesome, freakish ways such as blood dripping off his snarling teeth when his face rushes at the screen. But, most of the time Gordon tries keeping as much of the monster hidden as possible(at one point during the film, the freak robes himself with a sheet he stole off of a chair).

CASTLE FREAK was a ghoulish, twisted, gory, but at times fun horror movie, that was never to shy when it comes to several key gross out moments. The film reunites pretty much the same cast & crew who worked on RE-ANIMATOR & FROM BEYOND, Producer CHARLES BAND, Director STUART GORDON, writer DENNIS PAOLI, JEFFREY COMBS & BARBRA CRAMPTON, the latter two of whom always share great chemistry together. The special effects themselves, although not as over the top as those seen in RE-ANIMATOR & FROM BEYOND, are still extremely well done & extreme in their execution, as the film is not shy about displaying some really disgusting gore effects (although it's to bad the same thing couldn't be said for the vast majority of horror films, released during the horror movie drought of the 1990's) as we get a broken off finger, a chewed off nipple, cannibalism, a half eaten cat, a chewed off face, a slashing, a bloody whipping & a stabbing. The monster effects are extremely well done & the film is inherently creepy, with plenty of mood & atmosphere abounding. The film also displays an awful lot of sympathy for John who despite being the cause of his son's death is racked with guilt, which is even deepened by the resentment his upset wife displays towards him. Even the monster one feels pity for, as he was just an unfortunate, innocent child when he was chained up in the cellar & punished day in & day out, for something he didn't even do. Horror fans will definitely love this! especially if their FULL MOON fans or fans of director STUART GORDON's other works.

Now, years later, John learns that he has inherited a 12th century Italian castle. They come to do some inventory (John really just wants to sell the place) and do a little exploring. What they discover is that the castle also comes with a secret a monster, Giorgio (Jonathan Fuller) residing in the lower levels.What gives Castle Freak an edge over similar horror product is the overwhelming feeling of tragedy. A pall hangs over this whole film; one has to wonder if this family is ever going to be happy again. Giorgio, too, comes with his own desperately unhappy back story. As is the case with many a movie monster, he's quite pitiable as well as hideous. Fuller is excellent in the role. As often as he creeps you out, he earns your sympathies.While Combs does tend to get his due as a truly talented actor, this viewer would have to point to Castle Freak as a solid example of just how good Crampton is as an actress. She's more than just a pretty face. The dramatic tension between John and Susan is palpable. Dollarhide, too, is very good, delivering a sensitive and vulnerable performance. It's somewhat wearying that Susan keeps automatically dismissing Rebeccas' insistence of the other presence in the castle. Stubborn characters can be hard to deal with in this or any other genre.Director Stuart Gordon and his largely Italian crew create vivid atmosphere. They mostly try to avoid bright colours. In fact, this is one of those instances where it feels like the filmmakers tried to create a slightly colourized version of a black & white movie. The makeup effects by Optic Nerve are impressive, and Richard Bands' music is excellent.Castle Freak definitely deserves a wider audience.

Loosely inspired by The Outsider, probably my favorite H.P. Lovecraft story, the film is also probably my favorite Stuart Gordon film and, bar none, the classiest thing Charles Band ever pushed out of his studio. (Somewhat ironically, since the original Full Moon Entertainment was slowly decomposing at the time.) Castle Freak, despite its exploitive title, actually has its roots in deep themes of family, forgiveness, childhood, responsibility, cruelty, and love. A family inherits a castle in Italy. Deep in the bowels of the castle is a man kept imprisoned for forty years, starved, castrated, and routinely tortured by his mother. But the castle isn't the only thing with a secret. The Reily family is slowly coming apart, after alcoholic father John wrecked the family car, killing their youngest son, and blinding their teenage daughter. Mother Susan has never been able to forgive him and, it's made clear quickly, John has never quite forgiven himself. The two story lines slowly come together, the emaciated, twisted Giorgio a shadow mirror, reflecting back the family's darkest impulses.The film is far more serious affair then the previous Gordon/Combs/Crampton/Lovecraft collaboration. Re-Animator and From Beyond are certainly great in their own ways but Castle Freak is a much richer, deeper film. It's also far scarier. Gordon had previously displayed a strong handle of atmosphere on Dolls. Here, he graduates to full shadows expert. The final act, where Giorgio stalks mother and daughter throughout the castle, each hiding in deep shadows, is intense and sustained. The blind daughter is an inventive device, as it allows the villain to creep around her undetected several times. The castle is an excellent location, of course, which helps. It's definitely the most frightening film on the director's resume.It also delivers on the gross-outs. Gordon had, perhaps unfairly, received a reputation for a goremeister following Re-Animator. There's also more to his films then that but, honestly, Castle Freak delivers some nauseating gore effects. A cat being pulled back through a trap door is an early, unnerving moment. Bones crack and flesh rips as a thumb is gnawed off. The most notorious moment involves the titular freak's encounter with a prostitute. In what is probably a homage to extreme Italian filmmakers like Lucio Fulci, deranged Giorgio attempts to recreate an earlier rendezvous. It's a disturbing, memorable moment that skillfully combines twisted gore and protracted thrills. The make-up design for Giorgio is impressively unnerving as well. He looks truly starved and tortured. Odds are this movie will show you far more eunuch bits then you desired to see.The performances truly anchor the film. Jeffrey Combs frequently trots out his Herbert West personality without acting much while Barbara Crampton is usually confined to indistinct scream queen roles. Combs shows no ego as the alcoholic John. He sweats and cries, frantic, a man at the end of his rope. He is pulled between his frustrated libido, his persisting guilt over his son's death, and his own guilt over refusing to take responsibility for it. It's a career-best performance for Combs. Similarly, Crampton blows the roofs off. She marks a strong figure against Jeffrey, her grief translating as anger, not self-pity. Her own path to forgiveness is also wrought. As the blind Rebecca, Jessica Dollarhide conveys the blindness well, if not the character's panic. It is disappointing that she would disappear from acting after this. Jonathan Fuller no doubt had the most difficult performance, under extensive make-up and without his voice. He makes Giorgio far more then just a hideous villain but a sympathetic being. Castle Freak is a world where monsters aren't born, they're made.For once, the fisticuff endings doesn't feel awkward, a natural evolution of the characters and themes. The final scene, powered by Richard Band's typically excellent, mournful score, conveys a poetic sense of sadness and resolution. Castle Freak is fantastic all around, a true hidden gem. If you're a Combs or Gordon fan, you've probably already seen it but I think it's essential viewing for any horror fan.

In fact, I thought that this too was based on a Lovecraft story, but came to know from the credits that this Gothic plot was penned by Gordon himself.Its difficult to decide whether CF was the oppressor or the oppressed. An individual who is manacled, castrated and left to rot in a dungeon since childhood, coupled with frequent lashing with a cat-o-nine tails, cannot hope to grow up into a normal human being. And when such a person breaks free, he is bound to create havoc, since his alienation is total, because he has no sense of right or wrong. And so it happened with CF in the film.As usual, Combs rocks, and the female characters the prostitute, the mother and the daughter, all display their hot bodies with aplomb. The yelling of the mother got on my nerves after a while, and my only regret is that she was not ripped apart by CF.A point of confusion Just how long was CF in the dungeon after his crazed mother died? How did he survive without food and water for so long, till Combs' family arrived? I know that its futile to search for logic in a horror film, but still..Watchable, at least once, but certainly not a collectible. And yeah, the irritating, selfish mother, most definitely deserved to be messed up a bit by CF..

Then more than a week ago I was at my local store and I decided to get some horror DVDs, I found 3 movies (each one for about $2) Subspecies, Trancers and Castle Freak. So especially with Castle Freak I found that offer I couldn't refuse, after all it is a film directed by Stuart Gordon and the cover art is just amazing. However I' still a beginner with the work of Gordon, in other words I haven't' seen yet Re-Animator and actually I have seen just 2 other films by Gordon which are Dagon and H.P. Lovecraft's Dreams in the Witch-House (actually this is a Masters of Horror episode), both came from stories by H.P. Lovecraft just like Castle Freak and both are films that I found terrific just like Castle Freak. I watched it with a couple of friends last night and we more or less knew what to expect from it but actually this was still a really pleasant surprise for me since Castle Freak have certain elements that really surprised me and that I really liked. This has a simple story, we have that John Reilly (Jeffrey Combs) has inherited a castle that is located in Italy. The castle belonged to a duchess, in the very first sequence of the movie we see her and we see a certain action, we know that someone named Giorgio is also in the castle and John together with his ex-wife and his daughter (Barbara Crampton and Jessica Dollarhide) soon will see Giorgio. So we learn certain things, we learn that now John and his wife doesn't have a good relationship, a terrible chapter in the past marked their lives, John was an alcoholic and one night he was driving, his companions were his daughter and his son, his daughter is now blind and his son died that night. Then there's nothing to say when we see that John's wife is now away from him. John has been sober for a long time (I think he says that for 9 months) but during his stay in Italy he will drink again, he will not return to home. Giorgio is certainly the most important character, some kind of monster that at first was thought to be just part of the imagination of Rebecca (John's blind daughter). There's someone else in the castle will repeat Rebecca, his father will think that also however that chapter will be back and as I wrote he will drink again, he will take a prostitute to the castle, that his ex-wife and daughter are there is not an impediment once drunk mainly because the castle is an immense place with hundreds of rooms. Castle Freak has certain scenes that I wasn't expecting and certainly are graphic enough to can make that some persons cover their eyes. Of course Giorgio is the protagonist of those scenes, one that I like is when he loses some of his fingers while trying to be free again but is when he start to kill when those scenes happens. Giorgio is witness when drunken John is doing certain, obvious, things to the Italian prostitute. I didn't kill her, I fu***d her, Okay? will say later John to the police and certainly he was saying the truth however he teach Giorgio to do those certain things however Giorgio boy did something more. Giorgio is one hell of a disgusting character however is story is a tragic one, he is the son of the duchess and of the father of John who ran away with the sister of the duchess (mother of John). Then the duchess did her revenge, she made of her son some kind of monster, she forgot that Giorgio was also her son. Now Giorgio can't be, the very last scene is really great. Then I had my third pleasant time with a Stuart Gordon movie, if you come across with the DVD of Castle Freak or you find it on TV don't think twice, watch it, is amazingly entertaining, watch it with your friends and have a really good time!

Deciding to sell the castle, they spend the night so they can take inventory in the morning. Exploring the castle, they start to find evidence of why they've inherited the castle and who was living in the castle before them. She starts to suspect that someone else is in the castle with them, which they laugh off as being a wish born from her handicap, and their irritation towards each other continues to grow. As they soon fall under a series of strange accidents and disappearances, they come to believe that there is someone inside the house, and are forced to defend themselves in hopes of getting out alive.The Good News This one here wasn't that bad, and had some quite good moments to it. The fact that the castle here is an old-school Gothic masterpiece is something to be admired, since there's something about the design and flow of it that just lends itself to a creepy surrounding. There's the grand design of the place with the way that it's constructed and furnished, as well as the fact that it genuinely looks like it hasn't been lived in for a long time due to the amount of dust, cloth over the furniture and much more, lead to an overall great location. So many scenes here play up the creepiness of the castle, from the blind walk into the catacombs following a cat to the walk-through to gather inventory to the great sequence where they're chasing off after strange noises in the distance and are unsure of what they're chasing after, are all excellent examples of the film using the glorious castle suspense in great ways. The design of the creature in here is just as good, as the deranged and deformed features, over-sized teeth and the sharpened claws on the hands and feet are perfect in keeping with a great monster which is imposing and quite creepy. Once the bedspread is utilized manages to improve the design and make it much better. The scene where it escaped, by biting it's finger off to wriggle out of chains, is a great scene and manages to work in a couple brutal moments and is an overall great scene. The opening sequence is just as good, getting the brutal punishment underway that starts it off with a disturbing, cruel manner, setting up the rest of the film perfectly. There's a rather sleazy sex scene in the catacombs which manages to get really nice amounts of nudity into the film, that is well-done and combined with a later sequence with the prostitute inside the lair, comprise some nice amounts of nudity. The last big part of this that works is the really nice gore provided here, since the kills are really bloody. There's one that has the skin from around their hips and legs eaten away, another is bashed in the head repeatedly with a large chain, there's an eyeball eaten out, slashings with broken beer bottles and much more in here that makes for some bloody good times. All of these here make the film rather enjoyable.The Bad News This one here only had a few small flaws to it. The fact that the film spends a long portion of time with the family drama and the tensions with each other over their dead child is something that can get irritating. It's something that requires everyone to simply yell at each other for no reason at all, since the flashback actually makes it clear that there's no reason to be like it at all due to it being a complete and total accident, and is just thrown in for the last-second reprieve at the end. That is obvious, and ever since the flashback that supports everything from the one character states, all it does is just aggravate due to it taking up so much time on something that already has a foregone conclusion. The fact that it starts getting to the main action a little late in the film is something else, since this one has the creature loose about twenty minutes in, yet the rampage doesn't really start until close to the end, leaving a large middle section creepy but action-less, and that can be a turn-off to some. Otherwise, this here was a really fun film.The Final Verdict A really fun and enjoyable creature feature that has enough good parts about it to be able to entertain with only a few mild flaws to hold it down. Highly recommended for fans of this style of film, fans of the cast or creative practices or just a creepy monster film, while those who can't appreciate them should heed caution.Rated R Graphic Violence, Full Nudity, Language and mild animal violence "}{"Title":"Thoroughly affecting as well as scary modern classic","Date":"8 February 2008","Score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama, Horror, Mystery","Review":" I was immensely impressed by Castle Freak.

Jeffrey Combs and Barbara Crampton were both decent in well written and deep roles, and the daughter was pretty good too. The film did a good job of handling its emotional substance, the drama side of the movie, making everything more fraught and nerve biting. There was some very mean gore, at times making me wince, and some pretty nasty stuff going on as well. The back story of the freak is pretty disturbing and I definitely felt for him as a character as well as the main family.

His quite ambitious on that front, and Lovecraft influence features heavily again. On this occasion Gordon lets a freak out of the bag, where a tortured deformed abomination becomes a sex-starved beast on the prowl in an old dark creepy castle and a very troubled family man who inherits the estate being blamed for the bloody aftermath. The perverted nature is strongly built, and Gordon plasters the films with painfully unpleasant shocks, but still with a sense of foreboding reality. Morbid humour can be found in most of his efforts, but on this project the script keeps it reasonably straight. The unusually downbeat story stays to quite basic and moves at a steady pace, with some overwrought touches and daft dialogues being forced upon. It's not always as compelling as it should be, even with its emotional temperament. I just found the tale a little lacking and plain going in between the sadistic jolts. A big draw card would have to be the names of the charismatic Jeffery Combs and Barbara Crampton. Combs is sensational, and grows with convincing intensity of an tormented portrayal and Crampton is a shinning delight. The budget is quite low, but this Full Moon production is better than your norm and its choice of the Spanish locations and Gothic castle gave it an alienating, and dreary atmospheric ambiance. One thing that worked, and turned out to be effectively visible was Gordon's use of eerie, and howling sound effects that seemed to echo within any scenes in the castle's grounds. Even the music score had a piercing shudder to it. However the latex make-up of the freak became a bit too rubbery, but the flashes of gore stays nauseating and well delivered. Gordon's direction is solid, without surprising us, but he does well with the tight foundation to get these impressive results and the agile flow of camera was neatly done.

So, already I'm thinking it's going to be a classic. I wasn't disappointed. Gordon can be a horror genius sometimes. The mood is dark and the atmosphere and castle setting compliment it well. The two main characters are such tortured souls. You can't help but feel sorry for both of them. They are very human characters, both have good and bad qualities. I mean, Castle Freak is just misunderstood, he's not inherently evil. And Jeffrey Combs is a master at his craft. He plays an alcoholic who killed his son and blinded his daughter in an automobile accident. When I watch Castle Freak, I truly feel sorry for his character. He is the classic tragic hero. Combs is severely underestimated as an integral piece of today's horror genre. For all you gore-hounds, it's ever present and there's plenty to go around. The thumb scene is genuinely gut-wrenching material. Along with that, there are some truly grotesque sequences, especially in the director's cut. The ending is one of the most dramatic in horror history. Castle Freak should not disappoint true horror fans. "},{"Title":"Not Bad Overall.

Naturally, after reading on IMDb that some Full Moon films, including CASTLE FREAK, were filmed in the Umbrian town of Giove, Italy, I had to stop there.  Giove was about forty minutes from Rome, so on my way to Rome on the Autostrade, I got off at the Giove exit.  I hadn't seen CASTLE FREAK yet, so naturally when I saw in the beginning of the film that they were driving up that hill, looking at the castle, it just felt special for me.  I had to drive up that same hill, and do the same things the characters did.  It's just special to be in a place where a film is filmed, and then see that film.  The church, the bar, and the castle are all the same now in 2001 as they were in 1995.  I walked up the castle steps and looked around to a point where the locals threatened that the carabinieri (local police) might come after me.  The locals also explained to me that the producer of the 1980's series `The A-Team' now owned the castle and on occasion leased it to Full Moon.As for the movie, Jeffrey Combs gives yet another good performance as John Reilly.  Barbara Crampton, from nearby Levittown, gives yet another good performance.  And newcomer Jessica Dollarhide is also very good.  This is a very good Full Moon picture that is freaky and enjoyable with great special effects.  You definitely need to see the unrated version like I did to get the full aspect of what Stuart Gordon was trying to show you.  This picture comes at a time when Full Moon was adjusting to a new distribution system.  The Paramount/Full Moon distribution venture was now officially over (you can notice this especially when you don't see any coming attractions for Full Moon films in the coming attractions portion of the Videozone.)  All in all, CASTLE FREAK gets a definite recommendation from me.  ***out of****I enjoyed it, although you have to realize that in the end, it's just another slasher film.  The locally scenery is great, the acting is fine, and best of all, the gore factor is number one.  As always, get the unrated version over the R-rated one any day.

However there is a dark secret lurking in the castle, a secret that has been hidden for decades but now it's free, it has nine fingers & wears a bed-sheet. Oh, & it's also a deformed cannibalistic killer...Co-written & directed by Stuart Gordon I thought Castle Freak was a decent enough horror film but didn't quite reach the heights of greatness. The script by Gordon & Dennis Paoli was based on the story 'The Outsider' by H.P. Lovecraft & is a reasonable way to pass 90 odd minutes but I just felt there was nothing here that really stood out & grabbed my attention, you know what I mean? There's the family who inherit a property with a dark secret & that's about it only we know what the dark secret is within five minutes because the freak monster is seen even before the opening credits have started. Also, why didn't the freak bite his own thumb off years ago to escape? How did it open the huge locked cell door exactly? Who put & subsequently removed the picture of John's dead son in the family crypt? The body counts consists of exactly four, it's hardly the most exciting film ever made & it just feels a bit too routine, predictable & ultimately rather forgettable as there just seemed to be too many shots of people walking/running around the same corridors. It's still a good horror film make no mistake about it & has some positives going for it but I think I'd have completely forgotten about it by the end of the week.Director Gordon knows how to turn in a decent flick & Castle Freak is a nice enough looking film, it has a a great setting & the real castle location adds to the atmosphere immensely. There are some creepy moments but don't let anyone fool you into thinking this reaches the gory heights of Gordon's Re-Animator (1985) or From Beyond (1987) as there's not much gore here, the one & only real gore scene involves the freak biting the nipple off a prostitute & then there's some shots of her dead body with further bite marks & a bit when someone has some skin bitten off their face, the special make-up effects are good on the freak & there's a fair amount of blood splatter but overall this isn't that gory.Technically the film is good, certainly better & classier than the majority of Full Moon productions that's for sure. Actually being shot in a real castle (owned by the head of Full Moon) in Italy helps give the film a great look. The acting is pretty good, it's always nice to see Combs in a genre film & he is reunited with Crampton as they both appeared together in a couple of other Gordon horror films Re-Animator & From Beyond.Castle Freak is a watchable, well made & perfectly decent horror film but while I definitely liked it I didn't love it, Gordon has done better but this is still worth a watch.

Stuart Gordon, always one of the most talented horror movie makers, jumped right on this trend and shot this film on a beautiful location in Italy. Stuart Gordon already made some all-time favorite horror films in the 80's. The brilliant Re-Animator and the amazingly intelligent From Beyond still stand as few of the best horrors in that decade. When it comes to purely comes to the level of entertainment, Castle Freak is a not that good but Gordon manages to add some great dramatic scenes to this film. There even is a little room for sentiment. Not too much but just the right amount for a horror film. But die-hard Re-animator fans don't have to fear because there still is plenty of gore and blood as well. The make up effects are perfect as ever in Gordon's film and it's nowhere near cheesy. Gordon really is the best horror director alive and he had the chance again to work with his (and mine) favorite cast members. Jeffrey Combs is brilliant as ever in his leading role and he sure proves here that he can handle the more serious roles.

Even more loosely based on a Lovecraft story ('The Outsider', though you'd be hard to spot it!), and with Gordon's usual black humour and outrageousness, it doesn't live up to the earlier movies. Perhaps it was the absence of any involvement by producer Brian Yuzna, I don't know, but it's a very disappointing movie, and quite forgettable. The only thing I really liked about it was Jeffrey Combs performance. He always seems to take the material he's given to work with very seriously, and he was pretty impressive as an alcoholic family man trying to get over a tragedy which is unfortunately tearing apart his marriage. Barbara Crampton plays his wife, and it's a more subdued, unsexy role for her, with no skin, so her fans might be a little let down. Combs inherits an Italian castle after the death of a relation (Helen Stirling), and comes over with his wife and daughter (Jessica Dollarhide) to settle the estate. While staying in the castle, mysterious events begin to occur culminating in the murder of a prostitute (Elizabeth Kaza, who also appeared in the 1970s cult classic 'The Beast'), which the local police soon suspect him of. Combs frantically tries to clear his name, no-one believing he is innocent, the murder being the responsibility of - you guessed it from the title - the castle freak. The movie has one or two moments, but overall it's pretty mediocre, and I would only recommend it to big time Combs fans. He's very good, but 'Castle Freak' isn't.

The special-effects are average as well as the sound-effects. This film doesn't feel like a typical Stuart Gordon film. We see two actors from previous Gordon movies like Jeffrey Coombs and Barbara Crampton. Jeffrey has the bulk of the lines in the movie and though he carries the weight of the whole film on his shoulders, he fails to shine. Barbara has a very small role in the film and doesn't make any impact on the film.Johnathan Fuller is excellent in his portrayal of the freakish Giorgio. As the title character of the film he plays a depraved individual with unnatural sexual appetites. The gore in the film is graphic, but today's generation will find this film rather tame.More Stuart Gordon films Robot Jox(1989), The Pit and the Pendulum(1991), Fortress(1992.

"},{"Title":"A Few More Misses than Hits","Date":"19 September 2015","Score":"","Genre":"Drama, Horror, Mystery","Review":" I've been curious about this movie for quite some time. As an avid fan of RE-ANIMATOR and Lovecraft's writing, it seemed this was a natural, but as I skimmed sites like this for user reviews they always seemed to be quite mixed. After finally viewing this movie, it makes total sense why the reviews are mixed because the movie itself is a mixed bag.The basic premise of the movie is a standard horror trope. A family that's already being torn apart by familial strife due to some past trauma finds themselves in the middle of some supernatural terror. In this case, an alcoholic Combs, his pretty wife and blind daughter move to a castle in Europe that he finds he's inherited, but may already have a resident deep in its' bowels. The problems start with the look of the film. The viewer can see that Stuart Gordon (the director) has some genuine talent when it comes to creating a shot, with a heavy inspiration from the Hammer era of horror. The movie evokes, images of dark, romantic paintings and has moments of pure shivery chill. It's all ruined, though, by a muddy, dull color palette in the film itself. This thing looks like 80s PBS drama and gives the movie an appearance of being far older than it really is. The film quality ends up spoiling any true beauty.The problems continue into the acting. I am a huge fan of Combs. His roles in THE FRIGHTENERS and WOULD YOU RATHER are some of my favorite characters in horror. He brings an intellectual insanity to his villains that is fun to watch. On the other hand, he's just given too much room here and too much drama. The same goes for Crampton. Large chunks of the plot in this movie steer away from the terror in the dungeon to focus on the forces tearing the family apart (alcoholism, loss, infidelity). I didn't find either actor to be completely up to the task of pulling off these moments of dramatic dialog. Some of the weight of that error falls on the script itself, too, which is clunky.What saves the movie from being a disaster is the monster, the titular freak. He is gradually shown in slow reveals that lead up to the inevitable unmasking and he's a well-done creature design. The makeup looks good on camera, even in spotlight, and he inspires some terror. The movie isn't afraid to shed some blood, either. Buckets full of gore are thrown around, complete with raw, torn up skin effects that look great for low budget horror. WARNING to those who may be sensitive or unwilling to push the envelope some, there is a scene about halfway through the movie that will tarnish your images of oral sex, much like Gordon does in REANIMATOR.

While driving drunk, John wrecks the car and kills his five year old son and blinds his teenage daughter Rebecca (Dollarhide). Susan isn't ready to forgive him yet but goes to Italy where John has just inherited a castle. The family struggles to adjust, but what they don't know is deep in the bowels of the castle is the title freak. A deformed man that was beaten, abused, and chained up since he was a small boy. Shortly after the family arrives the freak (Fuller) chews off his thumb to escape his chains and is loose in the castle observing the family. With her other senses heightened, Rebecca can feel his presence even though she can't see him. This makes for an eerie scene when the freak roams into her room to get a closer look. The family doesn't believe her claim after the police turn nothing up during a half-hearted exploration of the castle. John falls of the wagon one night and brings a prostitute (Raffaella Offidani) home and has sex with her as the freak watches. Once John leaves, the freak attacks her and kills her in gruesome fashion. The police suspect John when the prostitute doesn't show up anywhere and John is arrested. Two cops are sent to watch over Susan and Rebecca and they are quickly killed off as the girls try to fight off the freak during a rain storm in the finale. This is the third time stars Jeffrey Combs and Barbara Crampton have teamed up with Director Stuart Gordon. Gordon manages to draw sympathy for the freak from the audience because the freak is like that due to years of cruelty. The castle provides some solid atmosphere as you might suspect and the lighting helps as well. The make up for the freak is ghastly and very effective and actor Jonathan Fuller does a good job in this difficult role. The freak is used much like the classic monsters of yesterday. He does graphic and terrible things but in ways it really isn't his fault. Like a lot of Stuart Gordon's movies, 'Castle Freak' doesn't skimp on graphic gore and blood and supplies it in good measure. Some of Gordon's normal dark humor is missing in this one, but it is stronger on atmosphere and mood. Set in Italy, this movie has a very Italian cinema feel to it, almost like a cross between Fulci and Argento. The thrilling ending in the rain storm is effective and suspenseful and the scenes where the freak is observing the blind Rebecca is the best of what this has to offer. Going down a slightly different path here, Gordon has a mild success with 'Castle Freak'.

He might not have such a well recognised 'classic' in his resume as those guys (although Re-Animator comes close, I suppose), but it could be argued that the overall quality of his output has been consistently higher than these better-known horror luminaries (who, let's face it, have had their fair share of turkeys over the years).If you don't believe me, check out the director's dark fairytale Dolls, his twisted Lovecraft adaptations From Beyond and Dagon (and Re-Animator, of course), and the gritty shocker King of the Ants&#x97;all solid films worthy of a place in any self respecting horror fan's DVD collection. But better than any of those, in my humble opinion, is Castle Freak, a splendid Gothic horror that really does deliver the goods in practically every department it's stylish, atmospheric, sexy, emotionally charged, scary, gory, and more than a little perverse, and even features the classic combo of Jeffrey Combs and Barbara Crampton amongst its cast.Combs plays John Reilly, who along with his estranged wife Susan (Crampton) and blind daughter Rebecca (played by teen hottie Jessica Dollarhide), has travelled to Europe to take up temporary residence in the 12th century castle that they have recently inherited. As John sets about writing an inventory of the castle's contents, Rebecca explores her new home, unaware that a monstrously deformed freak lies chained up in the dungeon, and he's very, very hungry...In the hands of a less daring director, this could so have been an instantly forgettable piece of cheesy B-movie hokum, but Gordon's unique, twisted approach elevates it way above your usual direct to DVD fare, and guarantees a few eye-openers along the way. Be honest, how many horror films do you know that offer full frontal shots of their creature's mutilated genitalia? And can you name more than a couple of titles that depict a woman's nipple being bitten clean off? Or have you ever seen Jeffrey Combs bury his face deep in a hooker's crotch before giving her a quick knee-trembler? I'm guessing that you answered 'no' to at least two of those questions.

It is like no other story I have ever seen, the location is creepy as hallway after hallway, stairway after stairway just makes for a very good suspenseful movie. The Castle Freak is truly wonderful in this movie, probably the best actor in it. Great special effects used to create his look. There is some disgusting violent moments if you are grossed out easily, and some serious nakedness, though brief. I like that the Castle Freak is not easily overtaken, he is fast, seemingly intelligent despite his horrible upbringing, and at times he even shows true sadness in his emotions. I actually felt myself feeling sorry for him a few times! The lead actor completely overacts throughout the whole movie, the wife and daughter are better. I do think it is weird how this movie, done in 1995, has the look and feel of a movie done in the late 70's/early 80's. Not sure if it is the film quality or if they meant it to be this way.

Castle Freak strays from this tried and true formula, to its credit.Barbara Crampton has the injured ice queen role down pat. If that were all she was her role would be okay. Her multi-faceted role also calls for her to be the guide and the protector of her daughter. As the movie unrolls her character grows in strength and believability.Jeffrey Combs' character is also well played but somehow does not ring as true. Part of it has to do with his relation to the items in the castle. He fails to show interest in the things that most folks would find fascinating. A small point but it tends to make the character a bit thin. This aside, his portrayal of a guilt ridden alcoholic in recovery is quite good. His character develops weakness as the story progresses. It is as if there were a balance of strength between his and Crampton's character. One grows stronger as the other declines. Combs carefully handles this descent until a point of no return unleashes Combs' character from any sort of restraint. As always, when playing over the top folks, Combs excels.Take the Freak and the associated gore out of this film and you still have a credible portrayal of a marriage on the rocks, and a man in recovery. With the Freak you have a credible picture with some stomach turning action. We are spared nothing in the un-rated version. The development of the back-story of the Freak is sparse. Stuart Gordon lays out the bare essentials. It's enough to give you the general idea but not enough to put you into sympathy with the Freak. Handled differently the Freak could have been a sympathetic ghoul. How much more impact that would have been is hard to say. No doubt someone you cared about acting the way the Freak does in the film would have increased the impact.The film has some holes in it. I won't go into them, as they do not ruin the film, only weaken it a bit. It remains a movie worth seeing despite its deficiencies if you can handle some gruesomeness. If not, stay away.

The Castle Freak is a wonderful creation, his look is just that, freakish, and as the viewer I felt both sympathy and hatred for him.  Rarely has such a character been created for a horror movie, especially in present times.The story, in a nutshell, revolves around an American family inheriting a castle in Italy.  The former owner kept her son in the dungeons below the castle, torturing him for years.  When the woman dies the Castle Freak is free to roam the castle.The films director, Stuart Gordon, does a nice job of including ample amounts of suspense as well as a few scares in the film, but he doesn't rely on them.  The story itself is interesting and Gordon makes sure to feed the viewer tidbits of information throughout the film.  One particularly nice scene has the Castle Freak showing a prostitute what his mother has done to him (a couple of body parts have been removed).  This scene really adds to the character of the Castle Freak and isn't played entirely for shocks.While the film has suspense, a few shocks and kept my interest from start to finish I still found that it was missing something.  I think what the movie was missing was atmosphere.  For a castle with 100+ rooms it didn't seem very big or creepy.  Even the dungeons, save for the Castle Freaks room, were rather dull.  With a better location this film could have been horrifying from start to finish.As it is Castle Freak is a pretty good horror movie considering it's from Full Moon and made on a pretty low budget.  Stuart Gordon does his best with what he has and the Castle Freak is a wonderful creation and gives the movie an extra point just for being a good character.  Castle Freak rates a 7 out of 10.

For one thing, the acting is generally good (except for the blind daughter, who can't act a whit). The story is original. The script is unpolished, but it has enough going on to keep you interested, without introducing needless complications. The monster is really scary, right up there with Frankenstein's monster. The gore is over-the-top and satisfying. There was too much emphasis on sexual assault for my tastes, but who ever said that B-horror was going to be tasteful? What I really liked about this movie is that it preserves all of the sensibilities of trashy horror, while actually focusing on the Reilly family and their troubles (which did not start with the CASTLE FREAK). The film actually has a *recurring theme* family loyalty. Breach of family loyalty created the CASTLE FREAK, and only family loyalty can defeat him.So, I give Gordon credit for making a perfect B-horror and throwing in an iota of meaning.

After all that I'd heard about this film, I really wasn't expecting it to be very good; but Stuart Gordon has once again proved his worth as a horror director with this excellent tale of terror! Castle Freak sees a great director doing what he does best. Gordon's love for HP Lovecraft is well documented, and Castle Freak sees him in distinctly different territory from where he was with previous successes From Beyond and Re-Animator. Castle Freak is a slower film than those two mentioned, but it's all the better for it. The story is the strongest element of the movie and at all times is at least as interesting as the central horror theme. We follow a family who move to a castle in Spain after it is inherited by the father. However, they are marred by tragedy ever since a car accident cost them their young son, and the daughter her sight. The tragedy continues when they move into their new home only to discover that they aren't the only inhabitants within the sinister castle's walls.Like all the best Stuart Gordon films, this one is lead by the great cult star Jeffrey Combs. Like the director, the lead star has found himself with a role that is nothing like the one that made him famous. However, Combs doesn't falter and his performance here sees him really prove himself as an actor. The script puts a lot of weight on the characters, and it is this that ensures Castle Freak is a cut above the majority of nineties horror films. Combs gets into his character excellently, and as the script allows his motives to be adequately explained, the cult star is given more than enough opportunity to ensure that he stands out. Combs is joined by From Beyond and Re-Animator co-star Barbara Crampton, as well as Jessica Dollarhide in her only film role and Jonathan Fuller, who had a role in Gordon's The Pit and the Pendulum. The rest of the cast is largely made up of European stars, which help to cement the film's Spanish location. The castle at the centre of the tale, with its many rooms, provides an excellent environment for horror of this kind, and Gordon makes best use of this to draw in a claustrophobic and horrific atmosphere. Overall, this film is highly underrated; Castle Freak manages to take in elements of horror, tragedy, love and loss all tightly wound around a distinctly Lovecraftian horror story. Highly recommended!

It's shot on film, it has real actors and locations, but still suffers the trappings of a low budget...the sets are underwhelming and nothing much happens. And that's one of two major beefs I had with this movie.1) Nothing much happens, and what does transpire is old news...there's a Thing in the cellar and before we dispatch with it there's a modicum of bloodletting and screaming. Meanwhile we have to sit through a healthy heap of tedium concerning the domestic problems of a small family. Despite the presence of some good B-movie actors these scenes seem superfluous to the action...which we never quite get to, except...2) When it does happen, it's outrageously repulsive. Not the most offensive thing you've ever seen it's just...this movie is just really icky! Out of nowhere there are a couple of things that transpire that include naughty bits that are just...unpleasant, and not in the fun way. I wasn't so much offended or caught in that so-gross-it's-fun mode as just...well, sorry I had to bear witness to it--and the effects weren't even that well done. It's just...the sight of the Freak and what he does to his victim is just...blecchy! And it's so completely out of touch with the rest of the movie, which is very USA Up All Night, back when that show was on. It's really weird to see an average little quirky B-film with this kind of grue in it.

But the combo of this not being quite bad enough to be really bad or good enough to be really good left me ambivalent, and left me stuck with the sickening images of Freak's mutilated crotch and the prostitute's mutilated boobs.

The Movie was not as Sci-Fi as it may seem from a Good Look at the Cover. At First I Thought it Would Be a Movie Like Alien, Which i didn't care for. It is Great just to Rent, but I Would not Reccommend Buying It. I Would Suggest Movies From The Puppet Master Series If You Liked This Movie.

After seeing Castle Freak however I was let down. I've seen Italian cannibal pictures that were worse but at least scary and shocking. The movie doesn't really have any scary moments and there are some gory ones, but the film just ends up being pathetic. Check out Gordon's earlier stuff if you want scares and shocks.

Without background to inquire (they will faster understand them than the non-fans). Merely a blatant attemtpt to cash in on Paramount's Cthulhu, due out later this year. Cthulhu, a new type of Pokémon, created as the ultimative krieger, and wants to conquer the world and provokes all Pokémeisters to a fight, if you catch my drift. Naturally our hero place himself to it and, while in the garb of history travels back to the Gay Ninties's, the Science Fiction Fantasy thereupon becomes the parabola on the still dominant conflicts between the USA and the Middle East, in which the cult members enslave human farmhands and break into against and prevent our hero from courageously traversing the swampland, and a few reminders of 9/11 along the way. Did you really believe, the Masters of Lovecraft would have really changed their success formula for the feature? This film is straight once is only 45 minutes long, as for Specials it gives a vast array of European language feature subs/selections -- But no Asian, Regardless that der Philipines is perhaps where can be found the 2nd largest fanbase (after the USA). Now, I am well-versed in German, Skrimish, Turk, Skandar, and know a little bit of Welsh-- but the Englisch of which seemed to be not like someone cut up a bunch of European language dictionaries and tossing them into the hat! There are endlessly more positive examples from the USA and Europe (Uncle Sam, Rugrats, Shrek, the smallest mermaid, Pettersson and Findus, Tobias Totz and it's like), therefore my recommendation Do not buy.

What do you get out of it?  Some pretty boring drivel.Okay, I'll admit, the atmosphere is good and there are a few semi-creepy parts...but the whole movie is generally boring and rather bleak.  The lighting especially is cheesy and looks like this movie was filmed with a home video camera...no joke (then again, this IS Full Moon Entertainment afterall...).  The main characters are at odds with each other the entire time over a personal tradgedy that occured nine months prior to them moving into the castle.  I thought the acting was good, but I just got annoyed at seeing Crampton play a truly miserable and often angry wife who despises her husband for being drunk behind the wheel and killing their son and blinding their daughter.  Like I said, the acting is good, but the performances get so annoying at times, especially b\c of the overracting.  I simply don't like movies that are so bleak, character and atmosphere wise, that there is noone to root for, I mean you feel the pain of these characters, but you really don't feel sorry for them at all, and no satisfaction since the 'resolution' at the end is really a cop-out and has no build-up. The blind girl did a pretty good job, but her character, like the rest got particularly annoying.I have seen From Beyond, The Dentist and now this, and I am so sad to say that I have yet to see a decent follow-up to the excellent Re-Animator given Stuart Gordon played a role in all of them (as well as our dynamic duo of Combs and Crampton).  I know others will disagree for whatever reason, but none of these films, including Castle Freak, were scary, nor campy, just gory and often, boring.  This one plays gore to disturb more than anything. There are a few moments where you will go Holy @#$%!, but it is not tongue in cheek like Re-Animator which means that is just plain sick.  Heck, even gore in slasher flicks is more entertaining than seeing a woman get her privates bitten off by the freak.  Which comes to another point, the freak is really gross looking, I'll give props where props are due, though he wasn't scary at all.  Imagine listening to the sounds of a mentally challenged person groan for like 90 minutes...this is what you get with this one.  The Castle Freak himself is grotesque, yet underdeveloped...all we see is him being the product of abuse, we don't get much of a glimpse at him beforehand, just a factoid here or there.  Overall, the characters, as I said before are pointless and there only to have havok brought on them.As for the deaths, they are pretty bad, and not very creative (though the hooker's death was very disgusting) and really have little suspense.  As someone else put it, this just turns out to be another routine slasher flick with a really crappy ending.  Heck, even Barbara Crampton didn't get naked for once, what is this world coming to? ;)Overall, very disapointing.  Only check this one out if you are a true Jeffrey Combs fan like myself...though I have seen him in much better than this, he does do a good job with his character.  5/10 stars, only b\c of the Re-Animator stars back together on the silver screen.

The story is essentially The Shining with a castle (or a very cheap set masquerading as a castle, to be specific) substituting as the hotel and a monster instead of the ghosts. The budget is the same you'd see from a Cinemax softcore porn, as is the photography, sets, lighting, and video it was shot on. The story is a failed attempt at sincerity there's no easier way to make your audience feel sympathetic for your characters than to show them experiencing emotional trauma. And the trauma in this movie is pretty trite. Want an example? A blind girl listening to a language tape teaching the Italian words for colors begins to cry at what she will never see.This movie had a few things going for it, however the monster is actually pretty cool, pretty scary-looking. And there is a pretty decent amount of nudity from Raffaella Offidani, herself a star of Italian erotic films. The gore, however, leaves much to be desired, as does the acting, even from the experienced Jeffrey Combs.Other than this I've only seen two other Stuart Gordon films Re-Animator and From Beyond, both of which were outstanding. But I won't let this little footnote in his career keep me from watching many more of his movies.

Castle Freak himself is a good monster. I would be scared to pieces if he was coming after me. However, the movie had some dumb parts about it.A husband goes drunk driving and kills his 3 year old son and blinds his teenage daughter. I suppose death is a greater damage than blindness, but you'd never know that the parents actually feel bad about their daughter being blind. All they care about is that J.J.'s dead! While their teenage daughter walks around running into things and talking about how she'll never be able to drive a car. The parents are like - honey, stop walking around without a guide, you know better than that, and then they cry and don't ever stop being depressed because JJ's dead. Sounds like favortism to me. The lines of dialogue are not very realistic or well done. For example, when a giant crash is heard in the castle, everybody runs down into the basement to see what it was. It was a huge mirror that crashed to the ground and shattered. The husband runs to the broken mirror in horror and plainly says, The mirror broke. I don't know, I would say a little more than that if a giant mirror mysteriously crashed to the ground in my castle. The husband and wife have some major relationship problems and it's funny to watch how dumb they are with each other. No one ever believes the blind girl. Advice If a blind girl says she hears things, believe her and don't tell her to shut up. I think this is the moral of the story. Listen to people when they tell you things or else you might end up killing yourself to prove your point. Lastly, I thought the best character was the main police officer. He was the best actor and character. Everyone else (besides Castle Freak) was pretty run of the mill. 3/10 "},{"Title":"Disapointing","Date":"25 November 2002","Score":"1 out of 4 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama, Horror, Mystery","Review":"  Okay, you have Jeffrey Combs, one of the best horror movie icons ever, Barbara Crampton, one of the hottest b-movie stars and Stuart Gordon, the genius who produced Re-Animator.

Jeffrey Coombs is usually a pretty solid genre actor, but the character he plays here is totally unsympathetic.
