I was expecting nothing more than some short scenes of our now-infamous actors smoking marijuana followed by trippy Willy Wonka scenes . Oddly, this did occur, but this film was much more than that. This film should be shown in every American History class in the United States. It not only showed the beauty of the country of which we reside, but it also spoke about the people that reside in it. You know the old saying, 'Guns don't kill people, people kill people', well after watching this film, it is a very true statement. We are afraid of what is different. We are a culture that is afraid of change, yet seek it so badly. We are a society of hypocrites, androids, and ignorants. We thrive on the fact that we are the best country in the world, yet somebody shows any disassociation of routine, we are the first to question and get angry. I would dare say that we have moved so far from the 60s that I cannot see why our parents do not cry everyday. Their generations was a free-spirited, mind challenging culture that explored all possibilities no matter the cost. The experience was all they needed as a reward. Now, we are more concerned about money and the family-plan that we sometimes place ourselves on the backburner to life. Wake, eat, and pay the bills. What a sad daily structure that we have. When was the last time you considered the possibility of just jumping on your bike and riding until you hit water? Probably not for a long time &#133; why? It is called 'bills' and 'responsibilities'. These are the choices that we chose to make, and for anyone to say that they cannot do it, I would have to challenge. You CAN do anything, it is whether you chose to do it is another question. I wonder what it will be like in another 30 years. Where will we be, and will the idea of individualism be lost? I can't wait to see &#133;Outside of the deeply rooted themes of this film, I felt that Hopper (who also directed) knew exactly what he was doing behind the camera. He kept the talking short, the music loud and symbolic, and allowed the background to do the explaining. I loved the fact that we really knew nothing about Fonda or Hopper's characters. It allowed us to relate to them. You could easily add your story into their characters and have the life that you lead and wish to escape. Hopper was able to transform this film from a drug movie to a film about humanity. Fonda, who also helped write the film with Hopper, did a superb job of adding Nicholson's character into the mix.Nicholson represented us, the American public and our love of liquor, football, and lies. I viewed Nicholson as the average American. He drank too much, was the product of a wealthy upbringing, but did not know much about the world. He was sheltered. He never smoked weed (in fact didn't even know what it was when presented to him), never left the state line, and never lived life. He constantly used the expression, 'I have always wanted to &#133;'. How many times do you hear this a day from either a family member or a co-worker? If you always wanted to do it, why haven't you? So, here we have Hanson, dreaming a dream but never following through, who is traveling with two guys that live the ultimate life and live by their own rules. They are complete opposites, but Hanson's words seemed to remain in my mind for a long time. He reminded me of one of my wife's students today that spoke about freedom. He knew exactly what it was, but never practiced it. Hopper and Fonda were walking (driving most of the time) representations of the word 'freedom'. It is tragic what happens to Harmon, because he (unfortunately) experienced the negative side of freedom &#133; hatred and fear of the unknown.There was one scene that just jumped out at me. It occurs in the diner before the incident later that night where our travelers experience hatred in the country they admire so much. They go from peace and love to fear and hate. It is as if they witnessed night and day. It was frightening to hear the words coming from people in that restaurant. It was not only scary to wonder what was going to happen to our narrators, but mainly that people were speaking that way to fellow citizens. I know that it still occurs today, and it is surprising to me. We bomb a country because they do not follow the same principles that we do, but we need to start asking ourselves this question &#133; do we need another United States?Grade ***** out of ***** "},{"Title":"This film was a rite of passage","Date":"17 August 2005","Score":"241 out of 272 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Adventure, Drama","Review":" I cannot overstate the importance of this movie in my personal development.In 1969 I was eighteen and a freshman at Cambridge University. I was also a near-fundamentalist and a member of the Christian Union. Its officials decreed that Easy Rider was unsuitable for Christian viewing; I'd seen some enthusiastic reviews which made me curious. Moral and spiritual dilemma followed. To view or not to view? I prayed about it - look, this is a long time ago, right - and decided that if it had been OK for the Christian Union's leaders to see it, if only to realise it was morally dubious, then it was OK for me. They hadn't been corrupted, presumably; the Lord would see that I wasn't either.So I went and it blew me away. I thought then and think now, that this is a magnificently perceptive commentary on hippie culture and one that only the medium of film can deliver. Naive idealism is weighed against the squalid reality of drugs (and indeed alcohol). Freedom is portrayed as often aimless, self-indulgent and downright boring. The underlying morality could be seen as puritanical a celebration of the free-lovin' drop-out Sixties it ain't, more a weary end-of-decade critique thereof. I would have thought there was much to commend it to the Christian Union moralisers, yet as ever they couldn't see past the surface - drug abuse, loose women. Yet it has its high moments, in more ways than one, and is always a treat for the eyes.My decision to defy the Christian Union by seeing the film was an early step out of my fundamentalist prison and I haven't stopped walking yet. No-one's ever going to tell me what I can and can't watch again nor will I censor anyone else's viewing. I'm still a believer, but not of the kind that the Christian Union would have thought will ever go to heaven. Guess I'll have to live with that.

THE BEST YEARS OF OUR LIVES captured the reality of the post-war 1940's. TAXI DRIVER is a masterpiece of social distortion and paranoia exemplary of the 1970's. No film other than EASY RIDER captures the late 1960's as seen by the American counter-culture. Peter Fonda and Dennis Hopper's story of two men who go in search of America and 'freedom' is a bona fide sign of the times. I may not have been around at the time, but it is great to see a film portraying the long-haired, hippie attitude towards an America in turmoil in the form of a biker flick, circa 1969.EASY RIDER is an exploration of vast and desolate parts of the country. Of course, the stop at Mardi Gras is a necessity, but what Fonda and director Hopper are trying to tell us is that there was no 'freedom' as they saw it. The sprawling journey shows filmgoers the multiple frictions and shattered idealism of a generation in the midst of cultural change. Sex, drugs, and music were exploding socially and 1960's ideology may have come to an end in 1969, literally and figuratively speaking - much like it shockingly does in this film.Peter Fonda plays cool Captain America, otherwise known as Wyatt, while Hopper is a paranoid prophet of the hippies as Billy the Kid. The stunning DVD version of the film notes the importance of Laszlo Kovacs, the director of photography. Much of the film consists of Kovacs' simple shooting of the riders as they travel spiraling highways and bigoted backroads. It is some beautiful footage and essential to the trip. A major deal is made, much grass is smoked, and the film takes off from there. Their ultimate goal is never clearly defined, but Fonda's final comment to Hopper may sum it up for viewers. Did they find what America was supposed to be about? I guess not according to Fonda.There is a surreal experience at a commune the Kid and Wyatt stop at. These scenes are out of a Fellini film. One significant shot paints the commune with a 360 degree pan across the faces of the live-in hippies. The expressions on the faces all seem different, some grinning, others just zoned out. Kovac's amazing camera work (especially on the road with the bikes) along with a virtual who's who in rock music of the late 60's makes for a sometimes visceral filmgoing experience. The immortal 'Born to be Wild' blares over the opening title sequence and everyone from Hendrix to The Byrds are heard throughout. EASY RIDER also contains one of Jack Nicholson's 2 or 3 most memorable performances, even to this day. As drunken lawyer George Hanson, he creates an amazingly funny and perfect counterpoint to Hopper and Fonda. He realizes what the general public can think of the long-hairs and puts himself in danger just by traveling with them. A bizarre notion of alien presence in the U.S. government is part of a hilarious conversation Nicholson and Hopper have over Whiskey and smoke. His scenes on Fonda's chopper with the golden football helmet are absolute, cinematic classics. Credit must be given to Fonda, Hopper, Nicholson, Kovacs, and Terry Southern for giving a new face to movie-making. They captured the era in a raw, jump cutting fashion. Maybe the hippies were not entirely right by trying to live off the land, or smoking dope all the time, but they may have been onto something.RATING ***1/2 "},{"Title":"My favorite movie of all time...","Date":"22 January 1999","Score":"157 out of 220 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Adventure, Drama","Review":"  Too often this film is relegated to retro documentaries and cheap nostalgia for an era too often reduced to its superficial artifacts (flower power, popular music).I was born in 1972, three years after this film was made, but the themes in it are still relevant and important to me.  Maybe I'm the last of a certain kind of American; someone wondering about what's still possible in the USA, and searching for the realized potential of the American Dream.  Perhaps what has changed since this film was released is that freedom - that is, real freedom, just doesn't matter as much to people as it once did. Self-enslavement is a popular past-time for today's numb middle class; a group of people who, I am convinced, do not dream when they sleep.This movie defined the road film genre, even though it was not the first of its kind.  I owe a debt of gratitude to Fonda, Nicholson, and Hopper for pointing out a very real truth about America and its often twisted approach to freedom.  By any standard, this is a film which should not be missed. It is a film I wish I had written myself.

When I first saw it at the theater, I remember liking the anti-establishment attitude and the rock music soundtrack.  Later, on T.V., I remember thinking what a great actor Jack Nicholson was...and how terribly low-budget the rest of the film appeared.                          And now, over 30 years later....it's one of my favorite movies of all time.  Peter Fonda tries to be Everyman....but he's really the most insecure individual of the group.  His cathartic trip at the cemetary in New Orleans is embarrassingly honest to watch.  His search is not for individual freedom...his search is for a family.  And yet, he is always the outsider, the observer.               Dennis Hopper is the sidekick, the fool.  And like a fool, he cannot hide his thoughts behind a socially acceptable demeanor.  He constantly says exactly what he thinks.  He has little patience for flower children, pretentious intellectuals, coy women, law officers, drunks in jail, or rednecks passing him on the road.  Like a fool, he is doomed.                            Jack Nicholson is the core of the film.  He does not appear until halfway through the bikers' odyssey, but the trip will not make sense until his face rises up from the jailhouse cot to peer bleary-eyed at his surroundings.  He is the innocent man of this group....he is the AMERICAN.                           This movie is just another road picture, the way ON THE ROAD by Kerouac was just another travel book.

This film is very much a product of the sixties and, like many things from the decade, will always be fondly remembered. Dennis Hopper and Peter Fonda, men of substance and substance abuse, wrote the film together and Hopper directed it. These two were obviously in the thick of what was cool in the sixties, and that gives the film an element of authenticity as we feel like what we're seeing isn't too far away from the things really going on at that time. The plot is simple and more just a base for the film to deliver it's real sting than anything else. It follows two motorbike riders on their way from Los Angeles to the Mardi Gras in New Orleans. We follow their exploits as they travel the country meeting various people including, most notably, George Hanson; an offbeat lawyer, played by the great Jack Nicholson.The American Dream has always been about freedom. But like George Hanson says; it's one thing to talk about being free, but something else entirely to actually be it. That's the theme of the entire movie, and the way that it plays out, and the ending especially, aptly portray the difference between saying something and actually doing it. The acting performances are a big part of the movie, and the two leads; Peter Fonda and Dennis Hopper stick out the most. The two actors brilliantly get into their characters, and after a while you forget that you're watching actors and start to think that these people really are these characters. Jack Nicholson turns up halfway through and steals the show. It's not hard to see why this actor went on to become one of the best of all time. Even here, he shows his charisma and ability to steal the show and that is what he would go on to become famous for doing later in his career. Last but not least, another great thing about Easy Rider is the music. Music was, of course, a big thing in the sixties; and it's a big thing about this movie. Classic rock accompanies the pictures of the two men rider their bikes, and it's very cool indeed. On the whole, this film is an out and out classic.

The two films I can honestly say that about are Lars Von Trier's Dancer In The Dark and Easy Rider. Easy Rider perfectly defines it.The flaws Well, the first half although entertaining it pointless. They basically just ride around and pick up hippies and go to a commune. Peter Fonda although he looks the part but for some reason something seemed missing from his character. Also, in the beginning there is a pretty annoying editing technique which they luckily soon abandon.The film really gets astounding in the second half. The whole film is shot very well by DP Laszlo Kovacs and the music might be one of the best soundtracks ever in film. I might even buy it. The film is filled with genuinely poetic ideas. Jack Nicholson gives a star making performance and Dennis Hopper is once again and forever THE MAN. This film is filled with many biblical metaphors which never came off as pretentious but very powerful. The film is filled with very strong visuals. No wonder Dennis Hopper once wanted to work with Alejandro Jodorwsky. The ending is might be the best part of the movie. It is almost the ultimate what the f*ck?' moment in history, but for such a chaotic film it fits perfectly. The ending is also powerful. It represented to me the end of a generation.Well okay. This movie I know will definitely not please everybody but for those who are open minded and into visually driven films, this film will certainly live up to its' title as one of the most influential films in American history.

As artistic expression during an angry era of war and social change, the film communicates a powerful philosophy, in lieu of a complex plot.Most scenes take place outdoors, in the American South and Southwest. Laszlo Kovacs' adroit cinematography, combined with an expansive soundtrack, hippie lingo, and cool clothes, convey the film's underlying message of individual freedom and nonconformity.

I find it fascinating that Hopper and Fonda took Roger Corman material and gave it an arthouse approach influenced by Godard and the French New Wave. Combined with breathtaking visuals, a well chosen rock soundtrack and some classic, stoned, improvised dialogue this is still an impressive movie all these years later. Fonda had recently made 'The Wild Angels', Hopper the less remembered 'The Glory Stompers', and Jack Nicholson 'Hells Angels On Wheels', but 'Easy Rider' reinvented the biker movie, and things were never quite the same in Hollywood for the rest of the Seventies. The supporting cast is interesting and includes a great role for the fantastically underrated Luke Askew as the Stranger on Highway, and cameos from the stars buddies Luana Anders ('Dementia 13') and Sabrina Scharf (Nicholson's love interest in 'Hells Angels On Wheels'), as well Karen Black and Toni Basil's New Orleans hookers, Phil Spector's coke snorting bit part, and a fleeting glimpse of a young Grizzly Adams. You either love this movie or you don't, and I'm most definitely in the former camp. A 1960s generation-defining counter-culture classic!

The first time I saw it, I thought it was just a jumble of drug-induced fantasies made by some spoiled rich kids.  Now that I've seen it again after all those years of historical perspective, I now see that it was truly a work of genius.Possible Spoiler!It isn't just a social commentary on the bigotry and hypocricy of the 1960's toward the long hairs.  Underneath all the groovy, man hippie dialog and constant drug use, you can see the real purpose of the film  It is a simple but powerful statement of the futility of going down the wrong path in search of the American dream.It starts out with our two righteous heroes scoring some big cash by smuggling drugs out of Mexico.  Their dream is to go to Mardi Gras for a big party and then retire in Florida with their ill-gotten money.   In spite of their crime, they are portrayed as innocent and gentle young men in search of personal freedom.  In the course of their journey, they experience several different lifestyles, none of which truly satisfies them.  They spend time at a hippie commune; which they find to be full of weird people who, instead of being truly free, are struggling for their very survival.   They go on an lsd-enhanced romp with some prostitutes in a New Orleans cemetery, which turns out to be a real downer for them.  They get exposed to verbal abuse and even violence by the rednecks in several towns along the way.  They connect with a drunk, but very insightful, lawyer who is unsure of his own place in the world. When it seems that he will start making a difference in the lives of our heroes, he is brutally beaten to death by some rednecks from the town they had all stopped in earlier that day.The only positive experience they have is when they stop to fix a flat tire at the farm of a God-fearing man and his family in the rural southwest.  While sharing a meal with them, Peter Fonda's character compliments the man about how he has his life all together, even though they are generations apart in lifestyle.So why are our heroes going through all of this?  They are searching for their own version of the American Dream.  Although they may be motorcycle riding hippies of the counterculture of the 1960's, their goal was to make some quick money so that they could retire from the worries of life.  It is very symbolic that they kept their drug-earned money hidded in one bike's gasoline tank that is painted with an American flag.  Rather than conforming to the world of the time by getting haircuts and finding jobs, they pursue their dream by getting some quick money and seeking the freedom to enjoy themselves for the rest of their lives.  The dream is the same, the motives are the same, but the methods are different. At the end they realize that they are really no different from the culture they sought to escape from.  Peter Fonda's character sums it all up with the simple line, We blew it toward the end of the movie.   Shortly after that is the famous scene of them getting blown away with a shotgun by some ignorant rednecks in a pickup truck on some southern backcountry road.  They start their noble quest in secret with a drug deal, and their quest and very lives are ended in secret on an obscure country road.  But their terrible end doesn't happen they find out that the freedom they sought wasn't at all what they expected it would be.I think this film still has a strong message even today.  Many of the social ills of our culture have their roots in the misguided ideals of the 1960's counterculture.  Those who think they can become truly free by rejecting the hard-learned principles that served previous generations tend to find that life has a way of enslaving them in other ways.As to the film, the acting is simple, straightforward and powerful.  The dialog is very understated, and leaves a lot to the imagination.  The scenery is fantastic, and the music fits the story perfectly.   Those who weren't alive during the 1960's may not understand it, but it is still worth watching.  Highly recommended!

For one thing, it doesn't glorify hippies.  In fact, Hopper and Fonda are really just businessmen, out to make the big score.  They're quintessentially American -- Fonda calls himself Captain America, and wears an American flag on his leather jacket, and has red, white and blue painted on his chopper's gas tank.  These guys really just want to make money, not change society.  If it were the 80's, they'd be selling computers.  Also, some interesting symbolism -- Fonda puts the stash of money resulting from the drug sale in his gas tank -- in other words, money fuels the American dream.This film is also an anti-Western.  Instead of heading west, these guys head east.  They pass through Monument Valley, site of many John Ford westerns. At an early point, they fix their choppers in a barn while a farmer fixes the horseshoes for his horse.There is a structure to this seemingly freewheeling tale  the trip starts out idealistically.  After they go to the commune, Fonda and Hopper skinny-dip with two hippie chicks in a bucolic, peaceful setting.  The music is laid-back, the Byrds, the drug used is marijuana.  It's an idealized example of free love.  Later, in New Orleans, our two heroes hook up with two prostitutes -- so much for free love.  Fonda breaks down during an acid trip, and instead of music we hear the jarring sounds of an industrial, urbanized landscape -- geographically and symbolically far away from that Arizona commune.This film doesn't glorify the hippie ethos -- in fact, it almost seems like a neo-conservative critique on the limitations of the hippie experience. Late in the film, Fonda tells Hopper, We blew it, a line that prefigures the ultimate disillusionment that set in during the early 70's, when the Age of Aquarius gave way to Watergate, malaise, Reagan and rampant consumerism.

The image that struck out the most to me was this idea of the cities versus the open road and expansive valleys. I noticed that when they were on the open road they were meeting interesting down to earth people that shared similar ideas with them. They come across the farming family that sit down for family meals and live off of the land. Wyatt seemed to admire this idea of living off the land and the willingness to offer them food and a place to sit while most people would turn strangers away. The family did not stereotype them or disrespect them because of the way they looked.At the point in the movie when they picked up the hitchhiker you could tell the distrust that people had towards each other. Billy did not trust the man even though the man was simply trying to do them a favor. Trust in fellow human beings was something rare during the time and it seemed like kind acts were suspicious acts. Billy was not a trusting person but he was also a little bit paranoid, while Wyatt was willing to believe in the goodness of people and give them a chance before judging them. Wyatt figured that the trust had to start somewhere.We can tell when the close minded communities are coming in to play because we are leaving the open road and coming to the small enclosed streets. When they run into George he is their saving grace from this small town. George offers a new perspective for Billy and Wyatt because he is a suit that does not judge them but he acknowledges the prejudices against them. He gives them the first straight answer they will receive on the way the world works. George's character was really refreshing and it was interesting that he is the one that gets killed by people that he 'represents.' I thought that the scene when they finally get to New Orleans and are tripping the cemetery is really telling of how religion was viewed by Wyatt and Billy. They are tripping and sitting on statues and graves and the girls start to take their clothes off while they run around and curse their parents and the world in the middle of funeral services. At one point Wyatt looks up at a statue and sees a great ball of fire crashing to the earth. This is an omen of how is life will end and it almost seemed like god was scorning them or something with that flash of fire kind of like the apocalypse.An aspect of the filming that I found interesting was the transitions that they used to go from scene to scene. The characters would be sitting by the camp fire and then to go to then next scene of them riding off was the three panic-like shots of the incoming scene. I thought that this method went well with the film and the characters because they were always changing scenery in search for something more. They were restless souls with no limits but they do not find clarity in the end. Wyatt felt that their experience in Orleans was not what they had expected and that they had failed but the question of what they had failed at was something that could be many different things. Easy Rider was a shocking film in a good way a film that many youths relate to because of the sense of restlessness and the need to live and be real.

Dennis Hopper on the other hand plays more of a hippy role, with his long flowing hair and by the way he dresses we can see a total difference between the two characters. Though these two characters are different they are both on a journey together to travel over the country to experience what real freedom was. The only thing they had with them were there hot rod bikes and all there money which was hidden in Wyatt's gas tank. One of the strangers that these two encountered along the way was famous actor Jack Nicholson. Jack played a man by the name of George Hansen who is a lawyer who seems to have a very clear drinking problem. They meet up with him when they get thrown in jail for riding their motorcycles through a parade in the streets of the town they were riding through. From there they go through a series of events which ends up leading to the death of George Hansen (Nicholson). Once Hansen was beaten to death by the town locals who had been hassling them earlier was almost the start of the beginning of the end for the two travelers.

Hopper doesn't even budge but instead gives them the finger, which then leads to him being shot while still riding his bike. Wyatt who was played by Peter Fonda then goes to get help for his dieing buddy. Though he never makes it because the hicks so to speak doubled back and as he was going one way they were going the other and shot and killed him as well.

That scene with Nicholson talking UFO's at the camp fire represents the great actor at his pinnacle. Anyone who has seen that scene surely wouldn't be able to resist inhaling!The movie started out in an optimistic mood, with Fonda and Hopper setting out to discover America. The audience is naturally drawn into all the excitement. After all, everything that the duo was going through seemed so cool and so within reach too. I try to watch every road scene carefully everytime I play this movie back on my VCR, to try to remember a few spots to see if I could find them in person next time I'm out there in the Southwest. The soundtrack is of course fantastic. What makes it even greater is how well the songs fit the film. After seeing this movie, it's somehow hard to picture Monument Valley without hearing the song The Weight in my head.The Nicholson take on aliens at the camp fire was the high point of the trip. Then things began to turn sour. Very sour. May be that's why I've watched the first half of the movie so much more often than the second half. And I bet I'm not alone. May be that sums up the whole movie pretty well. People are attracted to it because it represents their dream, and we can't bear to watch our dream die.

And today, it's viewed nostalgically as a relic from a simpler, more innocent time. But I think it's wrong to read the film this way, and robs it of much of its impact. Easy Rider isn't about living the American dream; it's about finding out there is no such thing.That's what I like most about this movie. Dennis Hopper and Peter Fonda could have made a smug, alienating critique on bourgeois American culture, and it's rather surprising that they didn't. Instead, they made a disturbing film with a big heart at its center, about two drifters who go out in search of what makes America great, and find that there's no place in it for them. The ending packs a wallop, and I'm always amazed that two newbies who were probably both loopy most of the time on drugs could manage to put together such a strong, resonant film.Jack Nicholson appears in a supporting role as another drifter the two pick up on their travels, and the always fascinating Karen Black appears briefly as well as one of their female companions.Grade A "},{"Title":"I admit I don't get it","Date":"19 January 2009","Score":"11 out of 16 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Adventure, Drama","Review":" I found 'Easy Rider' - despite its reputation as groundbreaking - to be 90 minutes of dull pointlessness.

I don't think Peter Fonda is a very experienced rider at all. He wobbles & jerks a lot on the chopper. He looks like he could have done with a lot more practice riding it. Hopper looks the more natural biker of the two.I didn't fancy staying up to watch this so I taped it. And as is always the way the damn thing started early so I missed a little of the start, Fonda & Hopper were already in the junkyard doing their drug deal, so I don't exactly know about the what's and why's of the start.The film is a very psychedelic look at late 60's America, It's almost like someone read some Jack Kerouac and decided to make it into a film. The film makes a very definite statement from the moment Fonda drops his watch before they set out on the road. They have no need to measure time or to know anything exact.They trip happily along having small things happen, A flat tire, picking up a hike-hiker (I almost thought he'd stolen their money when he said the gasoline had been taken care of), Taking him to the commune (that is one weird series of scenes) and then being arrested by the police for crashing a parade.Finally here they meet Jack Nicolson as a strange southern lawyer who has been arrested and gets them free. They finally wear helmets on their bikes (I assume they are riding through states and counties that have helmet laws) and Nicolson is wearing a Football helmet of all things. Though I guess it would protect him as well in a crash.During the camp fire discussion about Venusians, I totally got where Robin Williams' Mork got his ideas for The Friends Of Venus because he totally sounds like Nicolson. I also noticed later he was doing the whole braces over a t-shirt thing like Mork too.The scene in the café was heavily laced with bigotry, I'm amazed to think people could have ever been so narrow minded. Even towards people of their own color and very much so to how they spoke about the US flag. It makes me wonder how many people in America still don't seem to realize how long the civil war has been over.I assume the southern rednecks attacked the riders during the night (even though it seemed like a dream sequence) and they killed Nicolson even though he was most southern and respectable looking of the 3 men.The visit to the brothel is very quiet, subdued. The scenes play out very quietly like they are hard to perform until they go out onto the streets into the Mardi Gras. For those scenes the film takes on a very amateur film look, not well focused and color looking washed out.In the graveyard you get another one of the many Cut-together shots and very rapidly cut to and from various points of view which is difficult to watch and even harder to pay attention to.The characters are tripping, some on very bad trips but this quickly cuts to Fonda & Hopper having another fireside scene which seems to make no sense at all and then are back on the road again to somewhere else.The man who shoots Hopper has no reason, likewise when Fonda is killed. They are just 2 men on motorcycle's who the 2 rednecks take a dislike to and decide to scare them and end up killing them both. The film seems to simply have run out of ideas so they kill the remaining 2 main characters. The whole idea that they were going somewhere with their money to do something is suddenly lost.I totally didn't notice Toni Basil (yes, the same one of 80's fame who sang Mickey!) as the dark haired hooker Mary.

Here are a couple of bikers on the road, and things go wrong, and they meet up with some ordinary and less than savory folk, and they are less than admirable themselves.In other words, some reality here, and the movie was released 30 days before Woodstock, which is a kind of final rallying cry to the starry eyed (thank god) and a warning, in a way, that having too simple an idea of a new future is dangerous.Literally.Maybe the most telling moment in the film (and no accident that it's there) is the Mexican-American family toward the beginning, where they are living, successfully, on the land. They have traditional values (they pray, they have respect) and they are happy. Later, a commune of city kids, disillusioned young people who only want the best in the world, tries for the same thing, and they are clearly going to fail. It won't rain, they don't know what they are doing, they are acting only on ideas.So it is with our two bikers played by Peter Fonda and director Dennis Hopper (and for awhile, their tagalong lawyer in the form of Jack Nicholson). They are blindly hoping that they are in touch with a new order, a freedom that is so obvious and justified it can't be wrong. The drugs, the rednecks, the beatings, the disaster, are all naturally enough, too, but not in the idealism of their roadtrip. I think this is the 60s in a nutshell.

This film earned 100 times its cost; it was commercially as shrewd as a Coca-Cola ad. Just as intended, it had young audiences shouting Right on! at the screen and paying to see it again.

Their kids just paid to see the equally commercial, manipulative American Beauty over and over again-- and then threw a pile of awards at it. Some people never learn. Hopper's film was commercially shrewd in another way it attacked ordinary Southern whites, America's Bad Guys in 1969 (before everyone needed their Electoral Votes) in the crudest, most lamebrained possible fashion.

The whole time, the two men where in search of happiness, they tried to find it through money, drugs, sex, and just getting away from everything.

Then Jack Nicholson shows up and Pontificates about how being Free is talked about Relentlessly in America but if an American sees a Truly Free Person it is Scary and makes them Dangerous.Dennis Hopper Captured Lightning in a Bottle here with some Help from His Counter-Culture Friends Fonda, Terry Southern, and Bob Rafelson. The Cinematography is Outstanding and the Music Interludes Rock On and fit Smoothly onto the Paved Roads and the Wide Open Spaces. The Movie as a Whole is a Timeless Piece of Pop Culture and has Gained New Fans since its Initial Explosion and although some Today may find it Dated, be Assured and ask Anyone who was there, that is not the Case. It is a Captivating Reminder of just how it was at the Time.

Dennis Hopper ingeniously captures every last ounce of essence of a decade going through so much change, as well as acting as the encapsulating of the zeitgeist of a decade consisting of music greats as the Beatles, Jimi Hendrix and the Byrds - just to name a few. Hippies counter culture and the infamous Woodstock, as well as raising racial conflict in the wake of the civil rights movements. Upon the success of a drugs deal, two motorcyclists Wyatt (Peter Fonda) and Billy (Dennis Hopper) embark on an adventure to discover the real America on their way to New Orleans, but instead all they encounter is a dead friend at the hands of society that won't accept them because they are still stuck in its old ways, and is frankly terrified of a new world they don't understand and can't control. The only way I can truly describe this film is through the lyrics of the verse and their hit single bittersweet symphony. The bitter aspect comes from the fact that the good natured character had to experience so much turmoil. While the sweet is the essence of the hippie culture, which is all about peace and love and looking out for each other, then we have the symphony, Dennis Hopper demonstrates calm, assuredness and bravery for a man still in his directing infancy, but still yet has the ability to teach his elders a thing or two about honest work. For me Easy Rider was a film that was able to say and represent so much in a mere one and a half hours, that takes directors a whole career even to attempt to manage, and thus it was a film I really enjoyed.

I remember watching the tragic end in a New Jersey theater and seeing the audience leave, some with tears in their eyes.Sitting through it again, the first thing a viewer becomes aware of is how dated it is. There is Peter Fonda, young, thoughtful, soulful. There is Dennis Hopper, young, thoughtless, self indulgent. And Jack Nicholson with hair and a Southern accent, carrying on some phantasmic monologue about Venutians mating with humans. Fonda explains to Nicholson why smoking dope is better than getting drunk. How do you do it? Don't it lead to the hard stuff? I don't want to get hooked. There are discussions about the meaning of freedom and a kaleidoscopic vision of an acid trip. Much of it seems so terribly earnest and yet we know by now that just about everyone involved in the production -- Dennis Hopper in particular -- was more or less stoned throughout.And, all of that dated material aside, the movie still packs a wallop. I found a few scenes a little slow. (That exalted commune with the naive youths scattering seeds in the dusty earth; you'd have to be a joiner to agree with Fonda that, They'll make it.) It's common knowledge now that Fonda, Hopper, and Nicholson don't make it to Florida. They're bumped off by rednecks, after being refused service in a café. It seems hard for us to go that far back in time and understand the symbolic significance of the Hippies' life style. What an awful thing a little bit of extra hair was. It's hard to believe. But I was refused service and insulted in a Texas café a few years earlier because one of the two guys I was traveling with had a neatly trimmed beard. When we asked why everyone else was being served, but not us, the waitress was explicit. We don't care for your type of trade around here anyhow. And something similar happened later because the girl I was with wore a sweatshirt with the name of a Northern university on it.The year this was shot, 1968, represented the height of Flower Power. Like all social movement embracing freedom, it didn't last long. It turned violent. As Judge Learned Hand put it, A society in which men recognize no check on their freedom soon becomes a society where freedom is the possession of only a savage few. But those were the 60s, the most anti-nomian decade in recent history. It's ironic that most of the cries for more freedom now come from those parts of social space in which the most constricted and rule-bound Americans are found. It seems at times that the freedom they demand is the freedom to compel everyone else to live the way they themselves do.In any case, let me get down off this soap box. My nose is beginning to bleed from the altitude. All that dated stuff aside, it's worth catching again. It's a farragonous chronicle of the times, okay, but it's sweet too. All that innocence, all that belief, all the beauty of that landscape of the earth and the mind, laid bare on the screen -- and in color.

For everyone else, this is an excellent period piece from 1969 that explores the nature of freedom and the quest thereof.Peter Fonda and Dennis Hopper star as Wyatt and Billy, two hippies who travel by choppers from Los Angeles to New Orleans to attend the Mardi Gras. Along the way they experience gorgeous landscapes, a commune, jail, new friends, unexpected enemies, drugs galore and a whore house when they arrive.Jack Nicholson stands out as one of the friends they meet; while the beautiful Karen black & Toni Basil star as two prostitutes in New Orleans.What makes Easy Rider great is that it's more than just a road adventure with a modern Western garnish (i.e. cowboys on motorized horses). The film has depth that separates it from the typical biker flicks of that era. It's really about freedom or the lack thereof. Wyatt and Billy certainly have some grasp of freedom &#x96; and they desperately pursue it &#x96; but they're ironically so shackled by their OWN carnal desires and growing addictions that the most they attain is a piece of it. Wyatt laments near the end of the film We blew it; we really blew it as he realizes freedom has slipped through their fingers like water. Nicholson's character, George, has more of handle on what's going on, but he obviously has his own issues.The hippies at the commune seem to have escaped society's shackles but to what end? There's a reason communes never really caught on in America, and the film shows why.In an interview with Rolling Stone in the early 70s Fonda pointed out that Wyatt represented everybody who feels that freedom can be bought, that you can find freedom through other things, like riding motorcycles across the country or smoking pot. He confessed that Easy Rider is actually about the LACK of freedom in modern Western Civilization. Wyatt and Billy are not right, they're wrong. The only thing the writers (Fonda & Hopper) could do in the end was kill the characters. In a sense, committing self-destruction, which Fonda claimed America was doing. He said viewers often respond to the end by lamenting, Look at those terrible rednecks, they killed those two free souls, blah, blah, blah. But Easy Rider, he pointed out, is a Southern term for a whore's man, not a pimp, but the dude who lives with her. He's got the easy ride. And that's what he claims happened to America &#x96; liberty's become a whore, and we're all taking the easy ride.So what's the answer? The answer's there and it's pretty clear, but don't expect me to hand-feed it to you. Seek and you will find.In any event, this might give you some food for thought the next time you catch the film.Some modern viewers with ADHD criticize the film as boring, but I find it strangely engrossing from beginning to end. The climax is equal parts sudden, powerful, shocking and unforgettable.The film was shot in California, Arizona, New Mexico, Utah (Monument Valley) and Louisiana and runs 95 minutes.GRADE A "}{"Title":"'Easy Rider' is more of an artifact than a film","Date":"2 December 2012","Score":"2 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Adventure, Drama","Review":" 'Easy Rider' is unquestionably important, it's a seminal film. It was a large contributing factor to the birth of an era of burgeoning talent and art that produced many of the greatest films ever made. Easy Rider is a transgressive, political film; few creations have been so lauded for capturing the zeitgeist.However, to a modern audience, I feel it's more of an artifact than a film. To be frank, I didn't particularly enjoy it. I didn't find it that interesting, it didn't resonate with me that much. One connection it made with me was how it almost shattered that romanticised idea of riding the highways of America. Well, it didn't shatter it, but it certainly shows the potential emptiness of the experience. I'd still love to drive around America, but I'd gladly ditch the spirituality for clean hotel rooms and nice corpulent plates of Americana. I'd also prefer a muscle car.So, given its legacy, 'Easy Rider' is a hard film to judge. It would be ignorant of me to totally trash it, but I do think it's overrated, and I wouldn't recommend it to casual viewers.www.hawkensian.com "},{"Title":"Great movie... if you're tripping on acid/shrooms.","Date":"23 April 2012","Score":"2 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Adventure, Drama","Review":" I really disliked this movie.

You'll say Naah..!! Sounds like director has bit more than he can chew. This would be a mess with none of the issues being catered adequately. But don't pass the judgment till you have seen Easy Rider.Here is one film which is bound to give you your money's worth no matter with what expectation you entered the theater. Easy Rider is not only a road film. It is film on feminine equality, against regional inequality. It's a film depicting the politics in biking, about the pity state of motocross sport in the nation, total disinterest, bureaucracy involved in redneck authorities. Lack of funds, media support, facilities and about unfettering determination to win despite all these.Despite dealing with so many issues, the film is never over the top. So you don't have loud patriotic dialogs to infuse sense of patriotism. The film scores both as a hardcore entertainer and a hard hitting social drama. The message is there, loud can clear and so is fun. This will make you smile (at places laugh); make you emotionally charged (at places cry). Film's excitement is sure to give you goosebumps, be the match sequences, the training sessions or any simple confrontations between hippies and redneckers.Peter Fonda as Whyatt, the freak who doesn't stop his gang to beat the hell out of red neck teasers to inculcate the sense of team, is rock solid. This is easily amongst best performances of his career if not the best. He is never too loud, never too vulnerable. Just made to order for the role. You can not imagine any other actor playing the role. And with him are bunch of 16 unknown faces who surprise with their acting caliber and spontaneity. Apart from being top quality cinema, what Easy Rider does is raise hopes for future of American Motor Sports. Now isn't that a winner in itself. Go watch it. They don't make such films often. It's a MUST WATCH.

This scene was shot very well. There is different sort of effects and colors. This scene keeps you on the edge of your feet because it seems as though all of them had a bad experience with the LSD so you see many different things on the screen that they were seeing during their drug experience, which I thought was a realistic touch.

I don't think we can reliably know their intentions at this late stage of the game. While both Hopper and Fonda are still with us (though co-writer Terry Southern is not), so much time has gone by, and so many drugs have been consumed, that perhaps the crystalline purity of their original artistic vision has been, let us say, diluted, to at least some extent, I'm sure you'll agree.My view is that a lot of the good that ended up happening in this film was a result of pure serendipity and luck. Am I saying that Fonda and Hopper have no talent? No way. But here are some facts FACT Hopper, Fonda and Nicholson were actually smoking pot in the film where they are shown smoking pot. FACT there was no script for the film, only a short outline. FACT Much of the dialog was improvised. FACT Much of the cinematography was improvised. FACT Probably the most important scene in the film, the final campfire scene, was made up on the spot.When you're walking a creative tightrope like that, the odds are good that you'll end up with garbage. Fortunately for them (and for us, the viewers), it didn't turn out that way. They ended up creating the ultimate commentary on America, both in the 1960's, and, in a certain way, for all times.What this film says is that the Sixties Generation was a fraud. They said they would be different. They said at their beginning that they were throwing out all the trappings and evils of our modern society, going back to the land, doing something honest, pursuing freedom.But, after all, they didn't reject society. They were just as greedy and selfish as everyone else, in spite of their protestations to the contrary.Another famous film line comes into my mind I coulda been somebody, I coulda been a contender. The Sixties generation could have done something important. But, according to Fonda's character, We blew it. He and Hopper's character stand in for the entire counterculture. Wyatt and Billy go out into the world on their quest, and prove themselves to be just as greedy and materialistic as the mainstream society they reject. Fonda throws away his watch, but he also goes out and buys some dream machine and a silly leather costume, indulging in his own version of materialism hot bikes, good drugs and the open road, with an occasional hooker on the side.The dangers of freedom you're chasing after something that doesn't even exist. And this chase caused their downfall, (and the counterculture they represent) sending them to their doom just as clearly as those prejudiced Rednecks they encountered on their journey. A journey to the dark side of the American dream.

Either way, you have to watch it at least once in your life. It's also famous for popularizing the song Born to be Wild, motorcycles, and Jack Nicholson, so it's plenty of fun. It starts and ends very mysteriously, but it seems oddly seamless, in the same way that it's a timeless journey while being extremely 'dated', so to speak. Billy and Captain America (played by Dennis Hopper and Peter Fonda, respectively) pop out of the landscape on their motorbikes, purportedly from L.A. although there is really no way of knowing who they are or where they're from. Bound for New Orleans in time for Mardi Gras, they ride all day through the heartland of the USA and camp out at night because nobody will let them stay in a hotel. After a surreal stay at a hippie commune in the middle of nowhere (complete with its own come-again Jesus) they continue, only to be arrested in a small Southern town for 'parading without a permit'. It is there that they meet George (Jack Nicholson), a rich man's son with a mind of his own who decides to come with them to New Orleans to a legendary whorehouse. The movie begins to all make sense during a scene with George by a campfire following the first of several nasty hillbilly encounters, in which George theorizes that the reason people like Billy and Captain America are ostracized by a comfortable middle class is that people are afraid of freedom...they can talk about it at length, but when it actually comes to a totally free person, not tied down by anything, people hate them because they know how trapped they are. True freedom is scary to them. By the tragic ending, we see that it's true. It seems like this film is one long easy ride towards the end - symbolized by death, a cemetery scene towards the finish, the hippies sowing nothing but sand on their fields. Even the characters seem mythological, looking back...George is the voice of reason, ultimately silenced by fear of the unknown. Billy, a wild, distrustful schizophrenic, is representative of all those outcast by society or deemed too irregular to exist by normal standards. And Captain America - brooding, thoughtful, restrained - seems very much like the Dream itself in its final days...forever contemplating where it's gone, and not giving much thought to where it's going next. All in all, it's key to understanding a lot of things. In that landscape, with everything stripped away (home, possessions, dialogue...everything but the spirit) anything could seem possible. And Easy Rider is one of those rare movies that don't give you much to go on. What you take away from it is entirely dependent on the thought you bring to it.

Now there are four words that you don't want to see in the opening credits. They evoke a feeling of helplessness, like the feeling I got driving with my grandfather in the latter stages of his life. He wore these wraparound sunglasses so you could never tell if he was looking at the road we often veered from; lanes did not apply. And when someone passed him he took it personally, cursing at them in his Scottish accent, then speeding up to catch them. He was like Mad Max for seniors. Come to think about it, a movie about good IL' Papa driving across the country in his New Yorker would make for an interesting movie. You know, man, about how America devalues its seniors. There could be a scene where Papa meets up with another senior at a diner and they pop their thyroid pills. Trippy. Yeah, and you could shoot the pill scenes in washed out 16mm, you know, to show how crazy the pills make them. And then at the end, some young punks who represent the youth that's always disrespecting their elders could drive Papa and his pal off the road. End of movie. I just checked and that plot took about eight minutes to think up. Which, since it is loosely based on Easy Rider, is about right. For all that it represents &#151; rebellion, freedom, Peter Fonda's career &#151; this movie is a stinker. Granted, Hopper, like my dearly departed Papa, does make it to the end without driving headfirst into oncoming traffic (barely), but the trip is so harrowing it hardly seems worth it. Take the characters (please). Hopper plays, well, Hopper, a drugged up ranting lunatic. This persona served him well, but in the service of other directors. But with his severe personality, it seems no one was willing to check his acting choices. The result is an intensely unlikeable character who, when he's not taking drugs or ranting, is pawing every girl he comes across. I guess sexual predators were just a part of the Summer of Love. Hopper's character might work if he was paired up with up a charismatic partner, but instead we get Fonda fils. Living up to the reputation of his father must have been difficult, but it might have been easier if he didn't choose the exact same vocation. Poor Pete just doesn't have much of a personality, certainly not enough to carry a plot less feature. So what we get is two losers travelling across the land, meeting other drugged-out, semi-literates. There are things to recommend about Easy Rider &#151; Laszlo Kovacs is the real star of this picture; his cinematography is quite brilliant, especially his landscape shots. Fonda said he thought Easy Rider was like a western, but on bikes through John Ford's America, and while the comparison to Ford is ridiculous (Ford put more thought into one line than these clowns put into an entire movie), Kovacs captured the road beautifully. Another positive is Jack Nicholson, who doesn't arrive until 45 minutes into the film, does his best to save the picture, then gets bumped off. It's almost like the paranoid Hopper got rid of Nicholson before he could take over the movie. And what of the legendary ending? What does it represent? The end of an era? True freedom? The river that man built versus the river God built? I've always thought marijuana tends to dumb people down. It seems to turn off the switch that judges, so that everything is equally funny or interesting. It's almost like an attempt to revert to childhood, when cartoons and junk food were all you needed to have a good time. The script and the acting in Easy Rider were obviously fuelled my copious amounts of dope. And when it came time to end the thing, I think Hopper, Fonda et al. did what any kid would do &#151; they blew it up.

It's very psychedelic and not at all well developed.  I know it was in the sixties and that psychedelic movies were everywhere at that time but believe me, if you want a good psychedelic movie, watch something like Midnight cowboy or at least something good.   Wyatt (Peter Fonda) and Billy (Dennis Hopper) are two best friends.  Both of them are motorcyclists and one day, they decide to go on a trip across America.  Along their way, they meet many people and give rides all over the place.  They also start off the movie by buying and then selling some drugs which look like cocaine.  The first ride they give is to a man who is going to join his group and they all live in tents, setting themselves aside from society.  There, Wyatt and Billy are invited to have dinner and when they leave, two of the women in the camp come with them to a river on the other side of the mountain.  After they all swim in the river, Wyatt and Billy take the women back to their camp and they continue their trip.  Now here's the best part of the movie.  On July 4th, they ride into a town where there is a big parade for independence day in the streets.  The two men start to ride with the parade and are eventually arrested.  In the city prison, they meet a man named George Hanson (Jack Nicholson in a terrific performance).  The next morning, the three men are let free and Wyatt and Billy ask George where he is going and decide to take him with them.  But one night, as they are sleeping in the forest, some men from the city sneak up on them and start beating on them with sticks and they kill George.  The next morning, Wyatt and Billy leave realizing there is nothing to do but leave George there and they eventually meet their own destiny.  Dennis Hopper directed this movie which is considered by many to be an American classic.  I still don't understand why since there isn't anything special about this movie except Jack Nicholson's performance.  Other than that, there isn't anything special.  The movie doesn't even really have any specific goal.  I know it's a psychedelic movie but I've seen some much better psychedelic movies which had a goal.

As free men without the restrictions of normal life. When it comes down to it, the film doesn't follow much of a plot. In fact the first 30 minutes of the film doesn't even have much dialogue. Instead of focusing on a single story it builds up their lifestyle by showing how they live a building up their characters by showing how their lives function and creating their life through various encounters along their travels. Through these encounters we get many perspectives on how different people in America viewed the biker lifestyle at that time. Be it the fear of the motel manager or the aggression of the townsfolk, everyone in this film had a view towards them. With the growing reputation of the likes of Hells Angels and hippie culture at the time, the image of the life of the bikers was a highly negative one. People like Billy and Wyatt were viewed as a menace to society, simply because they were thought of as damaging American society. The films key concept was to destroy this stereotype and show these people were living life the way they wanted to live it in a realistic manner. It showed us all about how bikers actually lived their lives. Both the good and the bad. It shows us the beautiful sights from the endless deserts to the cosy towns. But also shows us how difficult the life on these roads can be. We see the friends and acquaintances they meet on the way. But we also see the people who hate what they are for no other reason than being something different. It's this honesty of the life that makes the script so interesting when it was first released. It tackled the free love era of the 60s in a way that hadn't been seen before by creating a more truthful version of what life on the roads was like. The realism goes to the point where a significant amount of screen time is devoted to showing them riding across the landscapes. There's no dialogue in these scenes and just the soundtrack to give them company. Not only is this a realistic representation of how bikers live their life by showing these moments, but it also shows the beauty of their lifestyle. The music works well with the landscapes to demonstrate the freedom and beauty that makes their lives so appealing to begin with. Easy Rider is visually powerful, contains memorable performances and is probably one of the best films looking at the free love way of life that I've seen. The films representation of their way of life will not be one that all will agree with. As Nicholson says in the film, there are some who fear the style of living bikers like this represent. But to those who are open on the bikers perspectives, this is an incredible film, giving a different perspective on this way of life.

But to my surprise this film had quite a bit of material to work with; whether it has aged well I'll determine in the end, and does execute them rather well. I would like to point out one negative I have with the film, which is the main stars. I don't find them quite interesting, and that's rather ironic because hippies were the symbol for freedom back in the day. That brings up another point; unless I don't know my history very well, I always thought bikers had respect or rather had intimidation over others, but here they're treated in offensive ways from redneck hicks. Perhaps their reputation changed over time. Some of the positives I would list are the camera works, while they're not too complicated or unique, it was made at a time of experimentation with filming and method acting. The fact that real drugs were used whenever the viewer would see narcotics. Notably; and obviously, the best factor for me is the supporting star Jack Nicolson. For starters I like how he doesn't really ham it up or anything of the sort, he's really just there with our main characters because he also believes that they represent freedom. Which is all the more saddening when he is later killed by some hicks. Also I don't quite understand why in the world anyone would go so far as to beat to death a hippie, were they hated that much? Now the characters I noted before as uninteresting are now sympathetic, because we just saw what happened to one of their friends; who am not sure was a hippie himself, and they're traveling America which is full of people who don't like them. The mere fact that there was at a time an America that was so dark and cruel is disturbing, and that there was; and in some ways still are, people who stood up against the man, and were treated with such disrespect for speaking their own opinion.

The landscape and cinematography are indeed reminiscent of Ford's westerns except that the cameras are mounted on moving cars and motorcycles, and the shots include power lines and paved highways in addition to buttes and canyons. A back-to-the-land theme is prominent, as when the bikers stop to fix a tire at a horse ranch, eat dinner with a large farm family, and eat home-grown food at a desert commune. All cities are the same, opines one character. I'm from the city, a long way from the city, and that's where I wanna be right now. It is a city, New Orleans, with its gaudy excesses, that draws Hopper and Peter Fonda's characters, but as they approach that destination their adventures grow darker and more dangerous. A depiction of a bad acid trip in an above-ground cemetery should scuttle any notion that the movie romanticizes drug use, yet the cast and crew reportedly spent much of the shoot stoned. If true, then the high quality (no pun intended) of the acting and production are all the more remarkable.

What it does do is catch some spirit of the restless sixties and in the process start up a new, if short-lived, style in filmmaking. Actually, the background notes suggest the results amount more to a happy accident than to anything planned. What Hopper-Fonda got was a first-rate cinematographer (Kovacs); a mostly improvised script; a couple of probing remarks; a blissed-out Jack Nicholson; and a lot of fresh looks at roadside America.Also, the three main characters are wisely conceived. Fonda's Wyatt is quiet but with good instincts. It's like he's experienced much more than he can articulate, so he lives mainly inside himself. Hopper's Billy amounts to a warning against too much dope. He's just drifting along to nowhere on a stream of hippie slang. Nicholson's Hanson is an establishment dropout via the whiskey bottle, who finds kinship with the two drifters. More importantly, he's also the only one who understands the bigger cultural picture. Together, they're a trio far from the usual Hollywood clichés. Importantly, no one of the three is particularly likable, and I suspect a lot of folks dislike the movie because of that.To me, at least, the movie manages two profound moments. But otherwise, its appeal remains that of catching the restless, even rebellious, spirit of the 1960's. Oddly however, there's not a single reference to the driving force behind the counter-cultural movement, namely, opposition to the unpopular war in Vietnam. Thus, opposition to conventional norms appears more a matter of drugs, long hair, and non-commitment sex than anything larger, such as the country's political or economic conditions. However, for younger viewers, it's important to point out that the so-called counter-culture that Wyatt and Billy represent pretty much collapsed once our war in Vietnam ended.Two points in the movie, however, are worth noting. I really like Hanson's remarks on how too much of America celebrates individual freedom at the same time they punish its expression, as happens in the movie. That's a good point and one not restricted to dim-witted rednecks. In short, convention extols freedom at the same time it practices conformity, sometimes to the point of violence. The other remark is Wyatt's rather arcane, We blew it. Because it's left unexplained, the meaning's been pondered over the years. My guess is that Wyatt understands at a deeper level than he can articulate that their life of drifting along with drug deals and dope is ultimately purposeless. They haven't really engaged with the commune or Hanson's murder or even with life in general. Instead, they're simply skimming along, seeing the sights, but nothing beyond the passing parade. In short, the drug-deal money has ultimately done them no good at all. I expect both this probing remark and Hanson's came from professional writer Southern and not Hopper or Fonda.The movie holds up pretty well as a visual experience. That plus the cultural point about individual freedom endure. Otherwise, much of what was so topical at the time has faded. Nonetheless, Hopper did indeed get the role he was born to play, while Fonda manages to convey the necessary inner groping, whether intentional or not. Nicholson, of course, gets the showy part, which he does well enough. But, for me, a little of his toothy exuberance goes a long way. Anyway, the movie spawned a number of imitators, but remains the best of its type, well worth catching up with since the overall message has not faded with time.

But I did appreciate how the film didn't necessarily glorify anything whether it be America, drugs, alcohol, the average Joe or freedom/the American dream. In fact the film seemed to raise a good amount of questions about them. The two characters in the film Hopper and Fonda weren't necessarily admirable people, the freedom of riding your motorbike across America wasn't as great as you imagined it would be, and besides they were doing this to get drugs to a certain destination. I felt as if though the film presented these two characters in such a way which almost veiled what they really were and made them out to be charismatic and likable fellows. I didn't feel as if there was any message in the film which we haven't heard, nothing extraordinary, it was a pretty average film in terms of message. The story itself was simple but it was told beautifully with images and music. I think the film showed how banal and senseless the actual counterculture can be, if you look at the film it never celebrates the hippies in fact it presents them negatively, it also does the same thing with middle America, in fact I didn't feel as if the film ever really showed us who the good guys were.

I think it's a good movie, especially for the time it was made. It's definitely a significant film, but it just wasn't for me. Easy rider touched on a lot of interesting topics such as hippies and intolerance, communes, and drug use. It was cool to watch the main characters on their quest for freedom, and I thought the film gave an interesting depiction of people from that era. I like to ride a motorcycle myself so at first I really loved the great shots of the open road and the country side. However, constant scenes of the duo's road trip became extremely boring rather quickly. The best parts of the film, or at least my favorites, were the scenes with Jack Nicholson. His character was very entertaining and humorous. I loved when he was talking about space aliens. I've seen a lot of sci-fi films and alien movies, but I had never heard aliens discussed quite that way and with the points he was making. Sadly, after Nicholson's character died I was again very board with the film. Dennis Hopper's character was annoying, although he played him well. I thought Peter Fonda's performance was bland and not very convincing. Also he was often rather emotionally ambiguous, even at crucial moments in the film. It may have been intentional, perhaps to portray the character as being detached and distant, but I didn't like it; it made the movie unnecessarily tough to understand. The whole thing was really drawn out and slow, far too simple, and poorly edited; the whole flash back and forth at every scene transition was just retarded in my opinion.

Low production values give the essence of rawness, and the verisimilitude for the era is about as close as it gets to feeling like an actual documentary. Peter Fonda and Hopper are great as leads, and their ride cross-country never feels contrived or out of place.Aimless, perhaps, but that's the era. The music is top-notch, every anti-establishment artist sans CCR can be found with a track here. Characters come as quickly as they go, as random listless faces populate the screen at every turn. Jack Nicholson's unfortunate foray into his first try with marijuana ends with tragedy, and I have to wonder if Hopper was trying to say that people driving cross-country doing random drugs and meeting random people had ill effects on the people that got tangled in their web of debauchery.They got theirs in the end, and again I have to wonder what Hopper and Fonda were trying to say by getting the lead axed. Perhaps they were going for different representations of the American flag and how the South perceives northerners, or hippies vs. stiffs.

I thought it was quite difficult and probably pointless trying to say something new, or original of a movie which is considered as a milestone in the history of cinema, and has been reviewed, analyzed, from every single perspective, so I believed it could be interesting instead to read some reviews of the time when it was released, to get a perception of how it was received by the audience, and by the establishment of that time, in order to make some reflections with reference to the modern world, after forty years have elapsed.My first impression of the main story involving the two outlaws, superbly interpreted by Peter Fonda and Dennis Hopper, was a kind of naturally human sympathy, however sometimes mixed up with a sense of annoyance no doubt they appear as bold, daring, attractive in the way they challenge the constrictions of society. But after all, what are they looking for, do they have true Ideals, or are they just escaping, with money in their tanks, spending, wasting money for pleasure, are they so distant from every middle-class, working man serving the establishment every day?Indeed, as I read some critical reviews of that time, both Italian and American, I found out, with my great surprise, that the movie was not so favourably received, not only by the establishment, or by a certain right-winged thought, by also by the left-winged minded. The first, accusing it of immorality, of destroying all the solid American ideals and belief in self-commitment and hard work, the latter as having simplistically reduced the new values of freedom, peace, non-conformism, anti-consumerism, proposed by the hippie era into an aimless and egotistic search for nothing, into a total lack of anything positive for man.Truth lies probably in the middle, and probably both were right on one hand, the story does not render justice to the complexity of the hippie era, to the true need for change lying beneath their communes, these people are quite naively portrayed and, today more evidently than once, appear as a little pathetic, so distant from the real world, on the other hand the world of the squares is presented as a world of selfish, cruel, disgusting people, capable of killing a man only for amusement too an oversimplified and limited vision of society.Forty years of history may help us see through the scenes more clearly and with the necessary detachment. Certainly, history has taught that the capitalistic way of life had many deep flaws, in the same way as the hippie era has proved to be inconsistent, deflated without leaving anything credible sign, that's why that vision of society portrayed in Easy Rider, seems today still more naive, too easily simplified, and so far away from the complexity of today's world. The myth of those times, if it ever existed, has faded leaving a sense of nostalgia for times where probably ideals, however utopian, could still make people join together and move onwards.Out of time do the soundtrack and the amazing and the breathtaking scenery of the movie remain no doubt that, today, like forty years ago, when you are driving along those roads, accompanied by some good music, you still feel freedom and life running through your veins maybe something of that myth has survived, but probably because it'a part of human nature, then as much as now.

But despite the film's standing as one of the most iconic films of the decade, and debatably of all time, it has also proved itself to have become one of the most misrepresented in the public eye. Far from being a simple narcotic fraught motorcycle road trip movie as it is most often known as, the story's premise is merely a springboard to the film's deeper and more resonant themes and social commentary. The film managed to capture the 'essence' and spirit of the sixties in a fashion which struck a chord with countless audiences at the time, and still carries an intoxicating message of counterculture for those willing to take it in. Upon viewing in a contemporary context, it is small wonder why the film spoke so directly to the youth of its time - the countercultural central message of two men cast out from society simply because of their looks and lifestyles is poignant, addressing teenaged alienation and existentialism in a way perfectly befitting the rebellious decade. However, Hopper's film transcends the notion of merely pandering to an impressionable teen audience, and instead uses the film's context as a carefully paced palate for critiquing larger standards of American living. The film's subversive take on the 'American dream' both relishes and critiques the central characters' search for freedom (begging the question to the end as to whether they finally find it, and how exactly freedom is defined) as well as presenting a disturbingly poignant portrayal of the American melting pot gone sour, and the prejudice often greeting the other. The audience is forced to ask themselves whether it is the essentially harmless long haired bikers, admittably different from what was deemed 'normal' but fairly conservatively so, or the 'normal' people jeering and casting them out who are the real 'threat' to an everyday way of life. Is it really so threatening to be different, Hopper and Fonda silently cry out - and it is a cry which leaves the viewer ruminating long after the closing credits. The central three characters all give subtly superb performances, perfectly essaying the sparse dialogue, and creating tremendously endearing and believable characters (although it is highly doubtful the 'stoned' scenes were acted bereft of any external substance aids...). The fact that we as an audience know next to nothing about the past of either main character is a clever touch, making them all the more allegorical or relatable for a widespread audience. Peter Fonda gives a career defining performance as stoic, quiet biker Wyatt. Ironically dubbed 'Captain America', Wyatt seems to be constantly attempting to find a niche in society or reach some form of social truth - always unsuccessfully. His LSD induced cemetery breakdown scene is tremendously moving to watch, and his final line is a source of infinite contention, resonating profoundly long after the fact. Dennis Hopper is similarly impressive as fellow biker Billy, who seems to have fully embraced and immersed himself in a countercultural lifestyle, always finding friction with those who do not instantly see eye to eye with him, whether a hippy commune, or a town of southern bigots. Billy is more than happy to simply go along for the ride, rather than searching for any profound truths like Wyatt. And in the role that brought him to public notice, the legendary Jack Nicholson gives one of his strongest performances as boozing lawyer George Hanson, the only character in the film who can see the country as it really is, and understand both sides of the culture clash - comprehending the freedom of a life lived without limits, yet making his living as a lawyer who boozes at nights. Strikingly funny and infinitely charismatic, yet with an underlying dramatic depth, Nicholson proves an uncanny ability to steal scenes without his later showy grandstanding. Viewers taking in the film will most likely either connect with its emotional core or not; there is no way around it. Safe to say those devoid of a more profound emotional connection will still have much to enjoy in the gorgeous natural landscapes and social commentary on the decade, each scene meticulously placed as essential to the film as a whole. But those who do connect with the film will have so much more of a profound experience the joyful sharing of unbound freedom on the road, the slashing political ruminations and cultural significance, the groundbreaking technical work and infamous rock soundtrack - but mostly a highly enjoyable, simplistic but profound journey of discovery and reflection - one which should be enjoyed by anyone willing to commit to giving the film more thought than a simple drug addled road movie. -9/10 "}{"Title":"There's more to this movie than meets the eye.","Date":"2 August 2007","Score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Adventure, Drama","Review":" I'm amazed that lots of the negative reviews focus on the drugs.

The movie does often require us to suspend our belief, but it was an experimental film. Generally, the movie shows the problems involved with 'so-called' freedom and escapist drugs. It shows what closed mindedness can cause some people to do. After seeing the movie when I was young, I was 10 when it was made, I believed until my adult years that long hair and a liberal attitude in the south would get you shot. Fortunately, on my business trips to Texas, Louisiana, etc., where I had some free time to explore, I discovered something completely different. Open-minded, thinking, caring people are everywhere and my own San Francisco Bay Area has plenty of rednecks. The movie is a good portrayal of types of people, scenery, and great music. And Hopper does act more like an amphetamine snorter. Hollywood never quite has the real world down. But then, Hollywood, and the people in the limelight there, are rarely in the real world.

Hopper has to be one of the most overrated actors. He hung on James Deans' coat tails. He made himself into the rebel from Easy Rider. However, his character was one-dimensional. He was basically a stoned dope. Despite Hopper's acting, Peter Fonda played a much deeper character. He was a hippy, but also a man of reason, respect, and peace. He flew in the face of all the stereotypes about hippies - by being kind, quiet, stoical, and a thinker. Jack Nicholson rescued the movie from boredom. He was a liberal dandy. It is funny how the redneck police officers respected him, because of his daddy warbucks, but automatically hated the hippies. That's what this movie was mostly about. In the Southwest, there was beautiful scenery. There were rednecks there, but no in your face rednecks. In Louisiana, there were in your face rednecks. If this was a documentary, perhaps the film could have looked into whether more settled areas produce greater class tensions. I loved the fact that the teenage girls loved the two hippies. Too bad there are no longer such innocent, carefree women like that anymore, who like anyone new and different. The redneck men of Louisiana, though, were portrayed as paranoid monsters. Some southern posters may find this unfair, but there was such glaring inequalities and racism in the South in 1969. It is only natural that these glaring inequalities were exaggerated for maximum effect on film. I don't like drugs, but the drugs were not offensively in one's face in this movie. The movie was about more that that. I liked the Phil Spector cameo. Look what's going on with him now. At first, I thought he was Michael Nesmith, but I know that the Monkees weren't into the drug scene. I also liked the hippie commune. A lot of them were from the cities, yet trying to idealistically make a living in the desert (or other arid land). I liked it when the hippies turned on Dennis Hopper's character, and started sing about his long hair. This was showing that 1969 was not 1967, and that the social movement of the 60s was taming itself and becoming more conservative. It was only natural that idealism would temper itself to the conditions of the harsh realities of life in the hippie commune.

You can get lucky. Or more accurately, luck can add to your skill and take it that grade higher. What painters call a happy accident. This was the right film at the right time and despite fine work all round, especially Jack Nicolson who became a star on the back of his short performance as boozed-out back roads lawyer, it is clearly a B movie. A smart one - but that doesn't change the fact.For those that never saw the hippie movement first hand or those that didn't see the American dream of freedom die (or at least change) this might not quite hit the mark. Indeed it doesn't quite hit the mark with me and I saw the sixties - although at a very young age. What kind of person needs to live in a world of controlled self-poisoning other than people that don't like reality?The Terry Southern script was probably written on the back of cigarette packet and actor/director Hopper was merely reflecting what he knew and felt at the time. A lot of intensity, but too little intelligence. Dope does that to you - making you think you are profound when you are just waffling. As a director he is (today) a proved mediocrity, although not without low budget merit.I actually like the American hinterlands. Too often ignored in movies (apart from Westerns) they are strangely serene and poetic, a land with the luxury of space where people even wave as you go past. The oldie soundtrack helps. This is what the good ol' USA is based on - cheap land and cheap oil and people that rarely feature in media. The unseen majority.This film made lots of money and lots of noise. As critic Roger Ebert said the kind of movie that people went back to watch again and again. Rather like Woodstock. I am sure that plenty have it in their DVD collection as well - having upgraded from video. It represents something that certain people want to own, if not actually watch.The long hair and the bikes alienate some of the locals and this brings in the cod melodrama that the movie needs, but doesn't hold water as drama. How would the locals know where the guys were camping or why would a lawyer take off with this drifters - has he no office to go to or no clients to see to? Indeed is he a working lawyer at all - sure the cops seem to believe he is, but maybe they want an easy life. If you went in to the cells claiming to be Napoleon they would go along with it.Indeed the back story is weak (a lot of the scenes got cut) and we don't get any kind of strong hold on the Captain America (Peter Fonda) character at all. Naked girls, drug dealing, prostitutes, dangerous rednecks, it all seems the same to him. Good acting or no acting - you decide.Easy Rider is an experience. Maybe they should include a joint in the DVD packaging! It will be less of an experience to those watching today as young people. I have no doubt that if IMDb was around in the late 60's this would be one of the top two hundred films. Every generation will mark this film down a notch until it becomes what it is bound to become in the long run a cult picture that captures a time, a place and a mentality that no longer exists. It probably only existed in the minds of a few hippies at the time anyway and I have never had much time for them. Too lazy, too leaching and too easily satisfied.

This song set the tone for the rest of the movie. The main characters, Billy and Wyatt, begin their journey from California to Louisiana. As they travel by motorcycle they stop along the way to pick up a hitchhiker, smoke a lot, and get a bite to eat wherever they can. These two emphasize the importance of taking care of yourself and being free, not just talking about freedom. In one scene, a man and his wife feed Billy and Wyatt, and Wyatt tells this man that he should be proud of himself for taking care of himself and living off his land. All the two want to do is have fun and be free. There is no real plot in this film, just motorcycles, drugs, and some good music.This film shows the insecurity of many people of the time. The younger generation was living free and doing what they wanted, but older people were scared of that. Billy and Wyatt knew this. Jack Nicholson's character, George, knew this. When the three tried to eat at a café, they quickly realized they were not getting served, and they were getting stared at instead. George tells Billy later that because they're free, it makes others dangerous.Jack Nicholson's performance as an alcoholic lawyer was excellent. He was the only entertaining character in the film. His strange little noises and faces made his character funny and interesting. In a lot of new films of this period you were able to relate and sympathize with the characters; however, I did not sympathize with these characters. Besides George, I found the characters boring. The entire film follows these characters while they motorcycle across the country and then they die. They die simply because some guy in a truck, who they've never met before, wants to scare them. The film seems to end abruptly and with no reason.

There was such turmoil, violence and uncertainty in the air. This movie serves as a barometer to the threatening mood. Wyatt (Wyatt Earp) and Billy (Billy the Kid) are two self-adorned modern cowboys. The scene in which they need to pull over and fix a wheel is paralleled by the two gentlemen applying a horse shoe to one of their horses while Billy and Wyatt are attaching a new wheel to their bike. Instead of their trusty steeds, they live a life of loneliness and seclusion on the open road as they take their motorcycles on a journey from Los Angeles to Louisiana with more than a few encounters in between. It is an attempt to recapture the old west. However, as is the theme of almost all of the westerns of moving east to west, the theme in Easy Rider is a migration from west to east.The journey they set off take is sparked by a drug transaction they had just completed and are now on their way to live a life of simplicity in the Florida orange groves. While en route to this idealized utopia, they also take in what the great country of America has to offer them. However, as they get deeper and deeper into unfamiliar territory, the idea of America is getting farther and farther away. The first few scenes of the movie are majestic panoramas of the beautiful south west of America with awe inspiring sunsets. When picking up a hitch hiker, they happen upon a self sustaining commune is which the inhabitants live a simple and joyous. Billy, the hot headed high tempered friend of Wyatt (also known as captain America) has a bad experience and wants to leave, which sparks Wyatt's reluctant departure. This is where their idea of America begins to deteriorate.They continue on and get deeper and deeper into the south. When joining a parade they see that life is not as easy going down in that part of country and realize that their kind of people is even less welcome. They are put in jail where they meet George (jack Nicholson). George is somewhat of an innocent alcoholic. He asks to see their amazing machines, referring to their motorcycles, and barely knows that marijuana exists. The men form a bond and soon roll into a back country town where they and their ideals are not readily accepted. The locals, played by actual people rather actors, immediately begin to toss slurs at them and judge them by the way they are dressed and there is a constant attack, silly as it seems now, on their haircuts. They start to get the idea that this United States is far different from what they believed it to be. After being verbally coerced into leaving the men set up camp and are attacked by the anti hippie generation because of their fear, as George puts it, of what they represent to them. And the group represents true freedom. I believe this to be the most telling line of the movie as it speaks to what the country was going through in a very delicate time in its maturation.Throughout the rest of the movie, the two protagonists', Wyatt and Bill, moods are changed. They don't what they've gotten themselves into. They reach one of their goals, which is Mardi Gras, but realize that maybe this isn't what they wanted. A well filmed LSD scene is incorporated into the script in which chaos ensues which symbolizes the turmoil of a nation. Upon reaching Florida, Wyatt questions whether this is what they really wanted. Did they really want to see the ugly side that their home had to offer. They would have been better off staying at the hippie commune because in the end, their ideals and life styles catch up with them when two rednecks shoot and kill them only because they didn't like the looks of them. The end of the movie is a haunting image of the disharmony of a country in disarray.

It's all a matter of perceptions and the subversive odyssey of Wyatt and Billy invites each of us to question our idea of freedom and morality. Easy Rider is the most defining movie of the New Hollywood generation because the very philosophy of this new counterculture was to unveil the innate good behind the seemingly bad young people with long hair, seeking an unreachable freedom through motorcycles or drugs, a hostile 'Peace and Love' counterculture with ugly and dirty people, all the more detestable because they were against the War. Easy Rider is the rallying cry of this misunderstood generation.The idea of losing a War is detestable for every American said General Patton, well these guys already conceive the war as a moral defeat and they were no less Americans. Wyatt rides a Stars-and-Stripes-motorcycle and a similar helmet and his nickname says it all 'Captain America'. And his buddy wears a bushman hat and Native-American style clothes, that's Dennis Hopper as Billy. Both are men who went looking for America. And couldn't find it anywhere, that's the core of Easy Rider the film is less an existentialist quest than a nihilistic escape, the freedom of Wyatt and Billy carries a big deal of tragedy. They're free because they know they can't fight the system without corrupting themselves so they just drive for their own ideals, earning them people's hostility. The film carries very strong 'Western' undertones, a rediscovery of America's territory, with new values, as if it was indirectly stating that the conquest of the West failed, that America didn't achieve much, didn't respect its territory, and maybe the outlaws are the real people, Wyatt and Billy are references to Earp and the Kid, and the wheel changing is brilliantly paralleled with a horseshoeing. Wyatt later confesses to the farmer that he admires his lifestyle, the way he achieved self-sufficiency with a big family my wife is catholic says the farmer with a smile. He just provided an interesting example of an alternate lifestyle that rejected the city without denying all the values like Family and hard work. Wyatt respects that.The following episode involves a hippie hitchhiker who leads them to a commune. The hippie counterculture, pacifist in nature, implied a huge come-back to the roots of Human nature, to a sort of hedonism that quickly revealed the limit of their lifestyle they escaped the city, but couldn't live without work and money, with just planting seeds on a desperately dry land and ask Divinity for rain, even Wyatt and Billy can't embrace this primitive philosophy, they maintain their cape to New Orleans. Life is made of many encounters and Easy Rider is full of them, but it's only when Jack Nicholson as the alcoholic ACLU lawyer George Hanson, makes his entrance that the film takes a spectacular takeoff and is elevated to its iconic status, because this time, we have the average man's perspective.Hanson is a pivotal character with his feet in the two worlds; he makes the most implacable diagnosis about the roots of America's ill being. Wyatt and Billy are pariah because they incarnate 'freedom' clothes, haircuts, smoking marijuana, drinking, it's a bunch of pleasures that are totally forbidden by 'American Way of Life', and what you're not strong enough to embrace; you'll be strong enough to fight. The rejection of all the traditional values reflects people's own frustrations, an anger they vented on the trio when they finally killed off Nicholson's character. Abrupt and anti-climactic, Hanson's death foreshadows the tragic path the film takes, these men have no chance to stand against society, but maybe the most exhilarating sensation of freedom is freedom to act even when the fight is lost. Easy Rider feels not just like a western, but like a modern revisionist western where at the end, it's the society that wins. Easy Rider is like the sad chronicle of an announced failure, foreshadowed by the enigmatic line delivered by Peter Fonda near the end We blew it &#x85; Billy. They couldn't find this America they searched for, maybe because this America doesn't exist. Even the possibility of this long trip was allowed by money, money earned from drug smuggling, sold to the establishment (incarnated by the Rolls-Royce) and hid in an American-flag gas tank, through a long-phallic tube. As Fonda said, they were literally screwing America's values, and indirectly compromising themselves like any other loser. Those who fought the system with sincerity like the hippies were meant to lose, those who rejected the city but not some values like the farmer, could live in peace and dignity, and the others were too compromised to succeed, the genius of Easy Rider is to be more than a milestone of a generational counterculture, it was also its own epitaph, when the prostitute's lovers realized they were, in their way, prostituting themselves.And maybe the film invites us to the same self-criticism as we should ask ourselves a few questions before judging it  Why many of those who cheered and applauded at the film's screening end up as bankers or conservative businessmen? Didn't they blow it too, surrendering to the system?Why the film rings a bell even if we didn't live that era, have things changed that much? And if we don't like the film, isn't it because it indirectly mirrors our own lack of freedom and maybe we unconsciously wish to be, even for once, an easy rider&#x85; "},{"Title":"its about what you represent !","Date":"4 September 2007","Score":"2 out of 3 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Adventure, Drama","Review":" Its about what you represent..

After watching this film, you will no doubt have realized that there was two main kinds of characters in this story. One was the character that was open minded, tolerant, and accepting of the world. The other type of character was hateful, close-minded, violent, and very scared of character number one and all the things that those kind of characters represent.First off, this is what today we would call an independent film. This movie was very renegade when it came out in the market. This particular DVD has a documentary called Shaking the Cage inside the extras sub menu. Great documentary, and the title says it all. Hopper and Fonda showed classic American balls by making this movie, and making it in the manner they did. Can you tell whose side I'm on yet? The photography is amazing. All of the road shots in this movie are stunning to look at, and the locations throughout the film are real, gritty, and distinctive. I imagine that even if this film would have had a huge budget, it still would have appeared to be very raw. Hopper obviously wasn't making a fantasy movie here, he crafted a very real story and placed it in the real world. This is a film that is intended to get the audience thinking, get them asking questions, and yes, probably make you a little angry. The activism that was born and raised in the 60's is still there in Hopper and Fonda's creation. These two men have always been involved in what has been called the counter-culture movement, and I guess this film is what made them household names for doing so.Awesome soundtrack as well, and how could there not be. I own the double CD of this film's soundtrack, and it's just beautiful music to listen to. Again, listening to it makes me think, and it makes me ask questions about my country and my world. In my opinion, anyone who considers themselves a truly free U.S. citizen should be a thinker, and should always have a little skeptic sitting on their shoulder asking questions about what is going on in the world around them.I think this film will stand the test of time as not only an entertaining film, but a fairly accurate historical document that covers a very turbulent and important time in our nation's social history. If for no other reason than to take a glimpse into the late 60's to early 70's, this film is worth watching. You will no doubt find yourself clearly on one side of the fence or the other about Easy Rider, there is no fence sitting. If you like it, it's brilliant, but if you hate it, it's boring hippie garbage. It is what it is.

While writing these characters, Hopper and Fonda no doubt transcended some of their existential beliefs into the film. This stipulation yielded some clever improvisation between the rogues. 	The shooting chart is somewhat limited, and this is especially true among the driving sequences. Many camera positions are duplicated (although many times to frame some breathtaking locations). A trendy, but deliberate music score help cover up some of Hopper's shortcuts. Unfortunately, this cycle is never broken. The swimming and hallucination montages serve up some interesting editing and sound choices. The bizarre New Orleans graveyard creates a torturous &#145;Alice-like-fall' into Wonderland. 	The use of jump cuts, even as a method of foreshadowing the climax is truly pioneering.

Setting out on their motorbikes on the open road, they pick up hitchhikers and meet locals along the way in a journey that reflects their whole experience of the period. Freedom of expression and love of peace are admirable qualities but not all the people they meet on the road share their opinions.Some films have such a cultural impact that they are immediately considered great films even if they are actually not that good as films in their own right and, as their cultural importance fades, so do does their standing on top 100 lists and the like. Watching it for the first time for quite a few years I was looking at it with a slightly more critical eye because I knew that I would be writing a review of it but I must admit that I sighed almost audibly when the film use a blunt tool to do the job of saying 'these free spirits are the frontier men of our time' by blatantly having a bike being repaired alongside a horse being shoed &#150; I appreciate what they were trying to say, but to say it without any subtly or trust for the audience is a real problem and took away from the film a bit. Sadly it does this quite a lot for the rest of the film, with the majority either being more heavy meaning of the era or a series of music videos.The heavy meaning passes for a plot &#150; or rather they want it to pass for a plot even if it doesn't. I understand it is meant to be freewheeling and so on and, as such, it does work as is worth seeing but anyone honestly looking for anything even resembling a narrative would do well to look elsewhere. As a music video it does really well though and has plenty of really cool tunes played over the iconic images of the pair on their bikes. So as an actual film I feel it is limited and, in fairness, not very good. However to only view it on this level is unfair, because I don't think it ever holds itself up as being this amazing film that aims for greatest &#150; instead it is a cult movie made by two drugged out stars that tries to capture the essence of the period (as they see it). In this regard the film succeeds, it captures the music and feeling of the period well, even if it is not exactly a balanced view if you happen to dislike hippies! There are a large amount of stories around the 'making of' as well, making the film more interesting as an experience and scenes of them tripping out become more interesting when you know they were really high or were really running around Mardi Gras. Also, for my complaining about 'obvious meaning', it does say a certain amount about the period and the attitudes; the ending is a particularly poignant statement that, although not everyone's experience of the sixties, is still worth hearing.The stars are OK as actors and give natural performances, not hard perhaps when you consider that they pretty much were being themselves and were drugged up for a lot of it. Fonda is iconic cool; Hopper feeds his reputation and it still lives on today in the public conscious. Neither give really great performances but again, to judge them on that basis is missing the point. Nicholson is good value but people like Askew, Black and Spector do nothing more than show their face.Overall this is not a great film but it is a great piece of cultural comment and it deserves to be seen for that reason. The music is very good and many scenes and pieces of dialogue are iconic for one reason or another. If you want narrative, character and structure then you are in entirely the wrong place, but Easy Rider should still be a piece of essential viewing for you at least once if you want to get a good reading of the 'classics'.

That's the only way to be totally free, man! Do you own thing, baby!! Can you imagine the whole country taking this advice?This was actually embarrassing to watch.

I was expecting a cult comedy, somewhere along the lines of Airplane! or The Big Lebowski. One thing I was not expecting was the film to send me into a melancholic depression, with tears in my eyes. Easy Rider is a perfect example of New Hollywood Cinema, a movement that started in the mid 60s and typically focused on more taboo subject matters, and had much darker protagonists. Easy Rider meets both of these qualifications, as it is about two drug dealing, pot-head, biker, hippies, that after making a big drug deal in California, try to drive all the way to New Orleans in just a few days for Mardi Gras, while simultaneously trying to find the American Dream. As they meet different people and camp in old ruins. The film was co-written by its leads, Dennis Hooper, (who also directed it), and Peter Fonda. It was also produced by Bob Rafelson, who was a key figure in the New Hollywood movement, and stars another key figure, Jack Nicholson, who starred in several major New Hollywood films (Five Easy Pieces, Chinatown, One a Flew Over the Cuckoos Nest, etc). Jack Nicholson gives the best performance in the film, which is pretty impressive feat, because they're all great and noteworthy, and he doesn't come in until halfway through the film. Jack Nicholson plays the character of George Hanson, a drunk in a small town with some pretty crazy theories about the government. But before we meet George Hanson, our protagonists have already traveled with several other colorful individuals that bring their own philosophy. Some of the best scenes in Easy Rider, are the camp fire scenes, where after a long day of biking the characters will just sit down and talk for 3-5 minutes, before going to bed. And the conversations they have during these scenes are some of the best written dialogue I have ever heard in any film ever, I don't won't to spoil any of the conversations for anyone who hasn't seen the film, but when you get to these campfire scenes, get ready for pure gold. One thing that isn't so good in Easy Rider is a montage that happens towards the end of the film, the idea is fine by itself, but goes on so much longer than it needs to that it just comes of as forced, but that's a small thing in an otherwise great film. Easy Rider is one of those films that has huge potential to change someone's life, like Ikiru or The Graduate, something that just is filled with some many emotions, and lessons, something that sticks with you long after you've finished watching it, and gets better the more you think about, something that will not only forever change the way you look at cinema, but the way you look at life. 9.3/10 "},{"Title":"great music and a counter-culture icon","Date":"7 February 2016","Score":"","Genre":"Adventure, Drama","Review":" Wyatt (Peter Fonda) and Billy (Dennis Hopper) smuggle drugs across the border from Mexico.

"},{"Title":"Easy Rider is a powerful movie that captures the American attitude and spirit in the late 1960's.","Date":"31 August 2015","Score":"","Genre":"Adventure, Drama","Review":" The premise of Easy Rider is rather quite basic; two friends, Wyatt (Fonda) and Billy (Hopper), ride their motorcycles from LA to Louisiana for Mardi Gras. Their drug fueled journey becomes a spiritual journey as the pair learns about themselves and America. The movie opens with the pair of guys parking cheap motorcycles outside a run down cantina. They are there to meet a cocaine dealer. The pair sample and approve of the powder. The camera cuts to the pair waiting near an airport runway. A Rolls-Royce rolls up and a well dressed man steps out. He, too, samples and approves of the powder before buying it for a large sum of money. The pair has made a fortune and plans to spend the money on a trip to Mardi Gras. They buy new motorcycles and set off into the desert roads.The acting in Easy Rider is solid. Dennis Hopper's performance as Billy is great. Initially, I labeled his character as hippy he has long hair and a bushy mustache and uses man as punctuation. At one point the two pick up a hitchhiker who is traveling back to a commune in the middle of the desert. The hitchhiker made me realize that there is a complexity to the characters that I missed. Billy is a hippy-like character in appearance but his temper and focus on worldly pleasures differentiate him from the others. Wyatt is a cool or relaxed type of guy and is the one that really grows through the journey. Unlike Billy or George or the hitchhiker, Wyatt is not a representative of a 1960's demographic. As George (Nicholson) explains, You are change and people don't like change.As Easy Rider is something of a road trip movie, a common artifact is the super long, scenery shots. Denisoff and Romanowski note, the music played during these riding montages, forms a sort of musical commentary. The soundtrack, beginning with The Pusher by Steppenwolf, continues with the iconic Born to be Wild also by Steppenwolf. You can see the progression of the story and tone throughout the rest of the soundtrack. Easy Rider is a perfect example of how music can be utilized to complement the images on the screen. Sure, we might have a great orchestration that provides emotional support but, here, the music provides a political (as well as emotional) support.Have you ever watched a movie where a particular scene is burned into your memory? Maybe it strikes a chord with you but as you see the shot you know that it is going to stick with you. I'd bet that it usually happens with scary movies. For example, you're in the shower and the Psycho shower scene flashes through your mind or if you are in a narrow, creepy hotel hallway, you might imagine The Shining's the twins. Easy Rider had one of those moments for me. Wyatt rolls the money they earned by selling cocaine into a rubber tube. He hides that rubber tube in his motorcycle's American flag painted, teardrop gas tank. It is a beautifully succinct yet complex statement about the US. One of the best parts is that the movie lets the image speak for itself.The cutting used at times in the movie is jarring. Instead of a Star Wars-like swipe cut or a fade to black transition, the movie alternates between the two scenes. We are watching scene A, then the movie cuts scene B but after a second cuts back to scene A. The movie alternates between the two scenes a couple times until resting on scene B. It is the type of cutting you might expect in an action movie. A character has a gun and points it at his or her target. The camera focuses on the gun, then the target, then the gun, 'bang,' then on the target. This rapid cutting is exciting so we are used to seeing it in an action but in Easy Rider the transitions between scenes aren't exciting. One jump, for example, takes us from the pair sitting around a campfire to Wyatt walking through a dilapidated Church. It felt jarring and don't quite know how to feel about it. I like the idea of using film techniques in unconventional ways but it feels awkward. Yeah, I can dig it. The idea that it is disruptive fits in with the rest of the movie which is socially disruptive.My only major qualm about the movie is that sometimes it moves away from visual messages to just sitting around a campfire telling us something. Consider the image of the gas tank and money. I know you can show some good stuff, movie, keep going; don't just regress into telling me something. This isn't a deal breaker by any means but it is noteworthy.If, for no other reason, to function as a time capsule, I recommend you see Easy Rider. It is clear depiction of a definitive time in American history. It also illustrates how film can resonate socially and politically. I think for a discussion post I will think about the responsibility of art, if there is such a thing. On a superficial level, or if you saw Easy Rider without actually watching it, it might appear like this film is glorifying a wayward and drug filled lifestyle. From what I hear, that's the message a majority of the original audience left with. In reality, Easy Rider is criticizing this lifestyle. If people misinterpreted its meaning, should it have been more overt? "},{"Title":"Not so much engaging for its plot or story but is educational in some respects","Date":"22 June 2015","Score":"","Genre":"Adventure, Drama","Review":" As much as actor Peter Fonda and Dennis Hopper have been veterans of Hollywood and performed in countless films, for many, this is probably the film they are most associated with all the time. During the 1960s, the United States was going through a very different kind of revolution. This revolution was not just one thing, but a multitude of areas that spanned various racial backgrounds and cultures. The Civil Rights movement was a largely significant event going on during the decade. However another significant movement that also went on during this time was the counter-culture. This movement was about the generation after the 1950s and below that was tired of the traditional American Dream and took matters into their own hands. This led to the idea of them trying to find themselves. This consisted of things people didn't normally do during the time as freely - free roam traveling, drugs, adultery, etc.This is more or less the same idea here but portrayed in a positive light. Dennis Hopper and Peter Fonda play Billy and Wyatt respectively as two free flowing traveling bikers out to catch the upcoming Mardigras in Louisiana. On their journey they come across other encounters that show them other types of viewpoints of the time. For the screenplay co- written by Fonda, Hopper and Terry Southern (writer of Barbarella (1968)), it really is quite thin in plot but as minimal a story that it serves, it does have a great depiction of the culture at the time and how other people viewed it too. There's an array of different social statuses that are covered. That means from the rural farmland, suburb communities and even hippie towns. There, viewers will get the experience of seeing the kinds of opinions that existed out in the US when riders like these would show up.Just because you live easy and travel around doing sight seeing doesn't always make you look harmless. There are people who don't mind and there are people who do mind. These kinds of views are elaborated on even further by another character named George Hanson by a young Jack Nicholson. Perhaps the only written part that isn't fleshed out is Jack Nicholson's background. Hanson comes on screen after Wyatt and Billy are jailed for parading without a license and Hanson helps them get out. So how did Hanson do that? If he had the power to have Wyatt, Billy and himself released, why was he there in the first place? Obviously for plot's sake but it does feel a bit contrived if only for that reason. Nevertheless the three main actors are adequate for the roles they are cast for and their dialog although quite bereft of intelligence is understandable either way.Yes, a lot of their dialog is reduced to including the word man in every sentence, but again it was apart of the culture at the time so it at least fits. Also, even though Dennis Hopper and Peter Fonda are the main leads, Jack Nicholson's performance is more lively and entertaining than theirs with his unhinged personality. However this does not mean Hopper and Fonda aren't good. The best part about their performance is that they are not portrayed as mean spirited jerks like the wretched The Wild Angels (1966) Peter Fonda starred in prior. No, they don't follow all the rules everyday citizens do but they are at least polite to the people they meet. On a technical basis of filmmaking there is only one component that doesn't exactly work quite right and that's the editing by Donn Cambern. Occasionally the transition between scenes will flicker with the upcoming shot a couple times before it finally sticking with it. Not sure what that was all about but it was distracting.The rest however is nothing short of bad. Surprisingly for its time there is no film score to this movie. Instead, whenever Wyatt and Billy are on the road fans of the older music will hear a bunch of their favorite songs. The best and most recognizable would be Born to Be Wild by Steppenwolf. Don't Bogart Me by Fraternity of Man and I Wasn't Born to Follow by The Byrds are all catchy, encapsulate and ooze the 60s era with their cry-freedom lyrics and rocking guitars. The one thing audiences will be blown away most by will be László Kovács cinematography. For a film involving a story with much road riding, you'd hope there would be plenty of landscape shots and that's exactly what you'll get. There are so many great shots of the western rocky desert. It is breathtaking even when you're not physically there. It's too bad Kovács passed away, he really had a good eye.It has some editing issues, one unexplained character back story and its plot is fairly simplistic, yet understanding the era it was made from kind of makes sense why (somewhat). It has decent acting by its main cast, the cinematography is great, and its music and accurate depiction of the culture back then makes it feel like an adequate history lesson.

His review was the first that rang a bell with me and he presents the basic theme of the movie very perceptively and concisely.Let me throw in my sixpennyworth here If you know something of the history of the making of this film it helps to understand it.When the film company looked at what Hopper had they freaked and said that no one would understand it and they forced him to cut the film down to 90 minutes.Now, the worst part Hopper had shot A LOT more footage and this just got thrown in the garbage! Imagine, when the days of 'director's cut' came around Hopper could have restored footage and made a film of 100 or 110 minutes or whatever! Now, those people who moan that the film is 'slow-moving' and 'nothing happens' or that the cinematography is 'boring', well, they certainly wouldn't appreciate a longer movie! I guess they've been spoiled by the frenetic cutting of MTV and modern action films! But for us who love the way it's paced... it would be magic! Actually, you can many times SEE and HEAR where the forced cutting has been done because the soundtrack song is suddenly chopped off in the middle! Especially the Hendrix tune, if I remember rightly! I personally love the footage of the black homesteads passing by as the Hendrix song plays.But then, I sometimes love stuff that others find boring. That's why I love Widerberg's 'Love 65' where there are long lyrical scenes with 'nothing happening' and why I love Sandinista, the tripple album by the Clash, because it has loads of great music that would normally have been thrown out to make a 'polished' double or single album. Some people even moan that the Beatles White double should have been pared down to a single album! Conversely, I sometimes find stuff that other people find brilliant, to be contrived and boring, like that Eastwood movie that got so much praise and awards, you know, the one where he's supposed to have forgotten how to mount his horse!!! Well, thank God we all have different tastes and opinions! Another thing Hopper had apparently originally intended that the two protagonists would have more of their own history explained that they were both motorcycle stunt or circus riders, and other stuff...Anyway, even cut to 90 minutes Easy Rider is still a great movie with a fantastic soundtrack!

The problem was a sickness that permeated everything at the time. As I've grown older, it has been easier to see weaknesses of these men.

It is a movie showing a road trip of two bikers to Mardi Gras, but that is not what the movie is about. The question is, how much of what it is about will you actually understand or care about? The movie does this thing a number of times where instead of a simple cut between scenes you get a transition where the new scene is flashing its way into the old one. Such a transition invokes drama or shock, but here the scenes do not seem to call for it.There is a scene from first-person perspective of holding a knife against the background of a woman standing with her back turned. In some context it would have been pretty obvious, but this was not in any relatable context. So what the heck, man, Dennis Hopper, the director and writer of this thing, what the heck? I see it trying to comment on the contemporary American culture and various layers of people and changing times, and sometimes the message is clear but other times I do not know if I see what I am supposed to see. Maybe I needed to have grown up in the 70s to see it more clearly.It feels like an avant-garde 70s modern art piece. No, I would not call it pretentious, there is definitely some interesting stuff here, but there is way more pushed into the film than it can handle.I just know there will be a lot of people either not saying anything about the movie because they are afraid of showing they do not understand a lot of it or people who will pretend to understand it and praise it for all their pride is worth.Whatever it is, Easy Rider is at least an interesting head trip.

The country was almost flipped upside in a sense and it was a challenge for many to embrace and tolerate the shift that was occurring in our culture. Easy Rider is a significant representation of the dividing line that existed between the American people at that time. The Anti-war, care free and love embracing sub culture faced disapproval and in some cases oppression from the Americans who believed in a more traditional, less tolerant, and culture lacking lifestyle. What is also significant of this film is instead of putting American atop an artificial pedestal as the greatest freedom embracing country on the face of the earth, it acknowledge the ugly truth about how others tend to act toward people who look and act differently then they do even they are doing no harm. The adversities Wyatt and Billy face in their journey and the death of both George and them sheds light on how seriously people mistreat those just because of their appearance and what it implies. Easy Rider also touches on the issue of what truly defines freedom and how despite its reputation people in America who just to exercise their freedom by going against the grain are discouraged from doing so. Furthermore the illustration of the prevalence of drugs and sex in the film is significant to the American hippie sub culture and younger generations of Americans overall being more comfortable with the idea of openly addressing drug use and sex rather than ignoring it by pretending it is not there. There is even a scene where to women are scene being sexually active. This shows the true change that was not only taking place in Hollywood but also America.

Born to Be Wild replaces Rock Around the Clock, but thoughts on youth revolt haven't changed much since The Blackboard Jungle and Rebel Without a Cause. Our duo ride with tombstone eyes, give the finger to the man and fund their exodus with well earned weed money. Their destination? Far out there, man. A vague vanishing point which includes Mardi Gras jubilees, hippie jamborees and desert communes, all surround sounded by Steppenwolf, The Byrds, Dylan and Hendrix.We're doing our own thing, Hopper rumbles. Stoned, they sit around a campfire, their improvised lines giving the middle finger to big studio straight-jackets. Horses become motorcycles, junk-yard marijuana the lifeblood of the new frontiersman. Laszlo Kovacs' the cinematographer, but Kenneth Anger, beatniks, dropouts and Terry Southern prose are the influences. Your time's running out, man, someone says. I'm hip about time, comes the reply. Bob Dylan's poetry flutters in the air, then stops. The bikes promise some elusive emancipation, but nothing lingers. We blew it, the stoners growl, speaking to a generation's wasted potential. Then came Reagan.Easy Rider has always been more a cultural marker than a good film. Released in 1969, and directed by Dennis Hopper, it was heavily influenced by Roger Corman's The Wild Angels (1966), which was also the first film to associate Peter Fonda with Harley-Davidsons and counterculture movements. From both these films would grow a number of existential road movies (Vanishing Point, Two-Lane Blacktop etc), most of which were about the death of a very specific type of idealism.Unsurprisingly, Easy Rider ends with our heroes being killed by reactionaries and rednecks, which to some sums up what happened to all mid century progressive movements. The film also features characters bashing Wall Street tycoons, views drug dealing as being less deviant than other corrupt institutions and features a now famous rant by Jack Nicholson I mean, it's real hard to be free when you are bought and sold in the marketplace. Course don't ever tell anybody that they're not free, 'cause then they'll get real busy killing and maiming to prove to you that they are. Oh yeah. They'll talk to you and talk to you about individual freedom, but they see a free individual, it scares them. When working for Reagan, George Bush Senior would often reference Easy Riders. We have turned around the permissive philosophy of the 1970s, he said, which made it easy to slip into a life of drug abuse and crime. In Bush's view, Clint Eastwood's Go ahead, make my day had replaced Nicholson's Something's wrong with this country. Poet Jeremy Larner complained at the time of Bush's speech that Neither film has much to do with what America ever was really like, but they &#x96; like the fabricated man who so confidently cites them &#x96; are part of the image-mongering culture that makes a reality of its own that is all but inescapable. For Larner, Easy Rider created a celluloid America of its own from which there was no escape.Bizarrely, Hopper would eventually become a big time right-winger, Republican and Reagan supporter. In hindsight, Easy Rider itself at times plays like a neo-conservative critique of hippie movements. Hopper's cast are ultimately more businessmen than beatniks, all out to make a buck. Elsewhere he has them stashing money in oil tanks, equates gas and the American dream (hippie freedom comes at a price?), and points to the limits of hippie experiences with acid trips that hurt and squalid encounters with prostitutes. Far from glorifying the drug-infused hippie counterculture, Hopper structures his film as a series of stops which (unintentionally?) point to the shallowness of said culture. Time and time again, Hopper's characters are given opportunities to find meaning beyond narcissism and hedonism, beyond brothels and bottle, but latch on instead to aimless wandering. And so we watch as they turn their backs on families, farms, gas stations (labelled sacred), whilst their visits to hookers are scored with Catholic tunes (Lord have mercy). Elsewhere, encounters are staged under cathedral ceilings or alongside religious icons. The film then ends on Ash Wednesday (the Christian Holy Day of atonement, repentance and for the contemplation of death), with our heroes shockingly killed. Far from being a hippie love letter, Hopper's heroes are strictly born to be mild, Easy Rider managing to advance a facile conservative morality whilst also bashing facile liberal stereotypes.8/10 &#x96; Not necessarily a good film, but Hopper conjures up a number of iconic moments, like the film's cool intro, in which Steppenwolf plays over an open road montage. Worth one viewing.

The ultimate counter-culture classic, Easy Rider directed by first time director Dennis Hopper, jolted a Hollywood in transition when it became an unexpected hit in 1969, encapsulating the freewheeling spirit of the times, and the divide between the youth culture and the Establishment. This unconventional classic, which Time magazine hails as one of the ten most important pictures of the decade, continues to strike a chord with audiences of all ages to this day. After securing a major drug deal in Los Angeles, two free-spirited potheads Billy (Dennis Hopper) and Wyatt, a.k.a. Captain America (Peter Fonda), buy choppers and hit the road, traveling from Los Angeles to Mardi Gras in New Orleans to experience the real America. Along the way, they encounter rednecks, experiment with LSD, visit a hippie commune, end up in jail, all in the name of living the American dream. While inevitably dated, it remains worthwhile, highlighted by Laszlo Kovacs photography, a great soundtrack, and Jack Nicholson star-making performance as a boozed up lawyer who tags along for the ride. Nicholson earned a Best Supporting Actor nod, while Hopper and Fonda continued to solidify their reputations. Easy Rider was the official U.S. entry at the 1969 Cannes Film Festival, where it won the Best Film by a New Director prize (Hopper). Opened across the country in September 1969, it mesmerized critics with its perspective look at America. The film also received two Oscar nominations-Best Original Screenplay and Best Supporting Actor (Nicholson). Highly influential in its camera-work, storyline, and 60's rock soundtrack--Easy Rider endures as the ultimate psychedelic road-trip.

As is explained by a ACLU lawyer they pick up along the way this is due to the fear they instill in that culture, and the freedom they represent. The two bikers end up as martyrs in the end, killed by some hicks. What a messed up ending, but it wouldn't have been as poignant any other way. (If they had just ended up riding into the sunset for instance, i wouldn't be writing this review. I would sleep well, and forget about this movie, without really thinking about things.) Awesome movie, required viewing for anyone who wants an peek into the counter culture, and the culture threatened by it.

This is a powerful look at the views of groups that were vastly different parts of society and shows what each of them were about. for example it shows that small town people aren't racist their in fact just pretentious people unwilling to accept change and want to protect what they care about. It shows this holds true in other groups depicted in the movie. IT is also impacted by its lack of a defined plot or conflict.

The whole point of Easy Rider is rebellion against everything, against what the older generation tells the younger generation to do and against class i s m and superiority based on whether members of a community hold you in higher esteem than someone else. This movie rebels in the first couple of minutes, and for the rest of the movie, with repeated scenes depicting casual drug use, sex, anti-establishment monologues and POV shots of people seeing as though they are high. The editing, especially, makes the movie, as it makes the iconic scene where they all drop acid in a cemetery and trip for 20 minutes. The movie is all about rebellion, and it rebels in every way it possibly can. It exposes societal issues in every way it can, with bright, clear lighting and straightforward camera angles and tracking shots. It makes the rebellion real.

Of course, in this case the story really is more about the journey than the destination, and it does possess an episodic nature as our two main characters, Wyatt a.k.a. Captain America (Peter Fonda) and Billy (Dennis Hopper) encounter many interesting individuals during their ride. The most memorable of them all will prove to be George Hanson, the boozy lawyer whom they befriend while in jail. This role is deliciously played by Jack Nicholson, and it's the performance that boosted him to stardom. Vivid contributions are made by all who appear, including the under-rated Luke Askew as the stranger on the highway, Toni Basil and Karen Black as a pair of N.O. prostitutes, Warren Finnerty as a solicitous rancher, and Luana Anders, Sabrina Scharf, Sandy Brown Wyeth and Robert Walker Jr. as assorted characters whom Wyatt and Billy meet while resting at a commune. Hopper was at the time thinking of retiring from acting to focus on teaching, but Fonda, his real life friend with whom he co-wrote the script, offered to let him direct the film. Hopper called upon his pal Nicholson to introduce him to Bert Schneider, a partner in an independent production company affiliated with Columbia Pictures, and with that meeting, the funding became available. Rip Torn was originally supposed to play Hanson, but as fate would have it, he left the production before filming and Nicholson - who was just supposed to executive produce the thing - stepped in. The result is a haunting, mesmerizing experience, one with a particularly bleak ending, that enables the main characters and the viewers to take in various aspects of America - negative as well as positive. Its ultra cool rock soundtrack is a major plus - who doesn't get a thrill to see Fonda and Hopper riding their bikes to the strains of Born to be Wild? Wonderful cinematography by Laszlo Kovacs likewise is a heavy asset. Some of those vistas are truly breathtaking, and the location work is excellent. This is one of those cinematic milestones that can continue to play to a new generation as the years go by, while also functioning as an impressive snapshot of a specific era. 10 out of 10.

The younger generation was beginning to develop a much different view on the world than their predecessors and starting to question institutions they had been told their whole life were unquestionable. The story follows two young bikers who are travelling across the country selling drugs and wandering with no particular goal in life other than to have a good time. They end up joining up with an alcohilc lawyer whom they introduce to the ways of their culture and in the end it ends up killing him indirectly. Although this movie was not as polished as it could have been i feel that the roughness added to rather than detracted from the character of the film. It gave it a gritty feel which perfectly matched with the lifestyles of the main characters. I found the ending when all of the characters are killed to be a deeply disturbing yet also intensely accurate portrayal of the mindset of the time. Change was to be feared and suppressed because change bred conflict. The only criticism i can possibly give this movie was that the dialogue at times got somewhat static. I found the acid trip scene to be the most appealing visually as the chaos and intensity of that scene perfectly portrays ones mind on lsd.

Secondly, the film contains a long list of content that would have been Hayes Code infractions, such as the selling and ingesting of illegal substances and lewd conduct. The protagonists with whom the audience sympathizes are undeniable drug dealers. Still, Dennis Hopper's film is unique in other ways. While the editing is not necessarily always fast paced, it tended to be very abrupt. The film contains zero fade-ins, fade-outs, or dissolves, which are pretty much a staple in film editing. Instead, the scenes were at times interjected with clips from the upcoming scene, cutting back and forth between the two before moving on.

The plot is so simple, yet so efficient. Many films with simple plots go far. Take for example my favorite film of all time, Clerks. It's a character driven film that is made possible because of the personalities of the people we are acquainted with. So this should've been an instant sign that this film was full of life and unexpected instances.So where does Easy Rider go wrong? It's not a horrible film, but it has some serious flaws that need to be addressed. Not growing up in the seventies, I think the relatable qualities have warn threadbare in modern times. My generation isn't all about peace, love, happiness, and relaxation, man. That is why I believe I didn't fully enjoy Easy Rider like I should've. I can see how this defined some people's lives, and perhaps gave society a better understanding on the hippie culture. Ultimately, over forty years later, the film just doesn't hold up.To begin with, the plot is very vacant. It's slim, slender, inconsistent, and hokey. If had not been for the music, I might have lost complete interest in the events unfolding on screen. The first couple of sequences where Captain America and Billy are riding on their choppers throughout the countryside with famed rock songs on in the background are unique and inventive. The style becomes monotonous when that becomes the central focus. Same thing goes with the lack of dialog. The film is vacant in the sense where there are very few scenes that humanize these characters. Most of the time, they are silent and empty, waiting to be expanded.Don't you hate when films do that? They introduce characters that seem like they can achieve greatness, but they choose to keep them flat and monotone? Easy Rider almost seems deliberately trying to keep these characters subtle and remote of any personalities.Still, the performances, when showcased, are fantastic. Peter Fonda and Dennis Hopper, who served as director and co-writer, are very well used and pack in unexpectedly impressive acting skills. Even Jack Nicholson is pitch-perfect, never striking a wrong note, as soon as he appears on the screen. Not to mention, the cinematography is enriching and glides the film along nicely.So to appreciate Easy Rider now, as part of a generation, you need to look at the things that previously went unnoticed or un-noted. The content is very minimal, like established before, the storyline is very slim and barely sustainable, and the character development is almost non-existent.Part of me believes the vague character development was on purpose. Maybe to give teenage rebels of the time a person they can perfectly put themselves into without complications. A caricature that can be made into a full character after you put yourself in the shoes of him. I wouldn't doubt that was one of the goals. From the different editing style in the beginning to the overall non-linear layout of the film, it seems Easy Rider dared to be different from the beginning.Alas, it doesn't work too well. It's deeper than other motorcycle movies I've seen of the same time period, but in 2012, it speaks to a generation that doesn't have ears to hear it anymore. My review is a compromise, leaning towards the positive side. I'm giving it two and a half stars. Maybe if I was a child of the fiftees and attended Easy Rider on opening weekend I would've given it more.Starring Peter Fonda, Dennis Hopper, and Jack Nicholson. Directed by Dennis Hopper.

It was a time where people truly revolutionized what the pursuit of freedom was all about. It was all about revving your Harley's, smoking that cannabis or that other cool adult candy that was being served freely. It was a time of civil unity amongst every American citizen, the era of protest against the Vietnam War something that all the baby boomers have either witnessed or experienced. Peter Fonda's saying of everything goes was proved effectively and it's all exhibited in a nice little package that will surely influence scholars who are curious of events and lifestyles that truly symbolized what the 1960's was all about. The DVD behind the scenes was very insightful and provocative. Fonda and the late Dennis Hopper graciously fills us in on the trials and tribulations of how they succeed in keeping it raw and real in demonstrating what events transpired in the late sixties focusing primarily in the southern states where discrimination was at its worse, segregation was becoming obsolete so the South took their hostile hatred towards the hippie generation, or any other punk who had long hair. The legendary cinematography Lazlo Kovac once again waves his superficial magic wand and lets the scenery do all the magic in creating a hostile environment towards these two biker mavericks as the take a cross-country road-trip from Los Angeles to New Orleans on their Harley Davidson's to find the real meaning of Americana. The highways scenes were truly authentic especially when they drive through New Mexico. The scene you don't want to bat an eyelash comes near the very ending where the camera pans out to give a chilling sensation that could either be a scene from the Vietnam War. Or a superficial sigh of hope of a new era that won their freedom. Sure in all its glory one cannot leave out the soundtrack that truly symbolized what the 1960's was all about and the talents behind these immortal artists of their generation. I mean when you hear Steppenwolf's Born to be Wild you better get that air guitar out and start playing. Other great iconic musicians include The Byrds, Bob Dylan and Jimi Hendrix will also rock your wold with and hour and thirty-five minutes of rock solid oldies that will make you feel like you're in Woodstock again. You wouldn't want to miss this iconic film for all the marijuana in San Francisco.

The tag line on the movie is about how two counter cultural riders travel from Los Angeles to New Orleans to discover America. I do not think that is true because it does not seem like they are out to discover America, but in traveling across the southern states they inevitably discover America, and what they discover is not pretty. To put it bluntly, the movie does not end pretty, and I do not think this movie paints a rosy picture of the American South (in fact, it seems quite scary and makes me think twice about traveling across country from Los Angeles to New York.Wyatt and Billy make a big drug deal and decide to travel by bike, Harley to be precise, to New Orleans for Mardi Gras. They probably should have flown, but that is beside the point. In their travels they meet a hippie commune, some Christian Indians, and a lot of rednecks. However these Californians are traveling across a very conservative part of the United States, and it is clear that they are not welcome. They have money, but it does not seem that their money will buy them acceptance. They are clearly different, and the conservative America does not like their difference.Jack Nicholson makes an appearance as a alcoholic civil libertarian lawyer, however he does not get results by fine sounding arguments, but rather by the sound of his money. He doesn't finish up well either. In fact, he does not even make it to New Orleans.Wyatt is a deep thinking, marijuana smoking, introvert, while Billy is a bit more outspoken. What is clear though is that they are not violent, nor are they looking for trouble. They just want to live the American dream (albeit by a big drug deal). The movie itself is very quiet, and I guess that is supposed to be the introspective aspect of it. We are meant to think about what the real America is about, and whether we are accepting of it. We probably aren't, but then again, those with a real conservative bent would probably not appreciate this film. It is quite critical and does cut to the bone.I want to finish off by mentioning the scene where they take some LSD. They have picked up a couple of whores from a whorehouse, and it is a very clean cut, upper class one at that. They then go to a graveyard and take the LSD. I must say that that scene was done really well, if fact it was one of the best drug scenes that I have ever seen. One actually wonders if Dennis Hopper made it from experience.

It employs many techniques that would become common practice without the untrained eye's notice. One of the main attractions to the film playing to the sound category would be its luscious soundtrack. It featured songs by various artists of The Band, The Jimi Hendrix Experience, and Steppenwolf, and much more. The music in the film in a word represents the search for 'freedom'. Note that the songs are always played as the duo of Dennis Hopper (Billy) and Peter Fonda (Wyatt) is on the road. The songs not only represent a specific time in our nation's history, at the peak of the late sixties psychedelic rock, but it it's also meant to enhance the natural beauty of the many landmarks they see on their journey. It creates a dream-like state of innocence because we are not shown the dull grays of the skyscrapers we're accustomed to. This adds to the idea of a secure purity thru simplicity as a bit of subtle symbolism as the two 'nomads' as they encounter various 'simple folk' in the form of country people and hippies.Another, and perhaps one of the most important components of sound in a movie, is the delivery of its dialogue. It's not just the lines themselves, although that's not to be reduced to negligence because films like the Transformers and Pearl Harbor (2001), tow popular Michael Bay films, specialize as all his films do in on-the-nose dialogue. On-the-nose dialogue finds it annoyingly necessary to repeatedly restate the obvious and try to level with the slow audience members who can't keep track of what's going on. This wears old quickly, and by the time one gets to the third film in the Transformers franchise you can literally predict each line. Peter Fonda's writing and direction are much more artistic and ambiguous, to my joy. Note the subtext of each voice in the film. Consider how Jack Nicholson's character is constantly rambling on in a drunken or intoxicated manner. It adds comedic contrast to the quest of the two other main characters, and yet it adds even more in the scene just before his murder. The characters are almost like children on a simple camping trip, chattering over the most random yet down to earth conversation ever. They speak of extraterrestrial beings, but really the whole scene is about the possibility of life beyond Earth, about the whole scope of man's miniscule stature in this familiar world; the kinetic curiosity of men wondering about things that which the y may never fully understand. When the group is attacked and suffer a heart-breaking casualty, the scenes prior make the moment truly heart breaking.One of the seemingly most vague lines in the film is delivered near its climax, where despite the all the money they've made Wyatt reflects on it all and can only say 'We blew it. It takes a deep internal inspection of not just the film itself but of one's own morality and conception of the world to pull any sense of it. In a similar fashion that Richard Kelly used in Donnie Darko (2001), I believe the theme of the film can breed a multitude of interpretations. For myself, I believe it was the search for a greater benevolent force behind the ugly violence that is the world. In a sense it was a quest for a certain sense of nirvana, specifically for Wyatt, who observed the simplified life of the strangers they met and marveled at them. Note how his friend always rushed but he always insisted on staying at each destination a little longer. That was his inner unseen motive that drove him, and the main reason why the character spent so much of the film on drugs. The LSD scene for example, you see him in the arms of a religious statue, perhaps suggesting in a somewhat nihilistic sense that in the desperate search for enlightenment sometimes all a man can do is turn to a distorted view of the world he himself created (thru the drugs obviously). The film ends on a bitter and tragic note because despite his well meaning, Wyatt never receives the spiritual enlightenment he was searching for.Of course I could also go into how the film subtly critiques the values of the so called freedom we have in America, but that'd be another essay in itself.

But most viewers find that there is more here.I liked this as much for what it doesn't say as for what it does, leaving me to think about it. For example, the first scene has our two heroes Wyatt and Billy closing a lucrative cocaine sale with a dealer who arrives in a Rolls Royce. Is this a singular event for them, or are they dealers of long standing? I am tempted to believe the latter, since it is hard to believe they have such high level contacts otherwise. Where did they come by the quantity they were dealing with? And how did these two characters come to be what they are at the beginning of this movie? That is never even hinted at, allowing us to fill in the back-story. What was their motivation for the trip? They are not about to tell us, since they don't have much to say. We have to try to understand these guys from their actions, from what is shown of what they see along the way, and from the few interactions they have. If there is any emotional depth, it resides in Wyatt who projects a certain contemplative humanism. I couldn't get much more of a handle on Billy beyond drugs, sex, and good times. How did these two get tangled up with each other?As the two bike through deserted highways in southern Arizona and New Mexico a sense of freedom of the road and the beauty of the landscapes is well presented. We get a little more insight into a basic theme of freedom when Wyatt and Billy meet small town lawyer George Hanson. The idea of getting on a bike and just taking off is so appealing for George that he joins the trip. Fortunately George is a bit more articulate than either Wyatt or Billy and he is given some good dialog. He notes that Americans are always talking about freedom, but when they see a truly free individual, it scares them and makes them dangerous--a prophetic remark, given what is about to happen to George as well as, later, to Wyatt and Billy . George also opines, You know, this used to be a helluva good country. I can't understand what's gone wrong with it. Since this movie came out after the Kennedy assassinations and during the middle of the Vietnam War, George's comment resonated with a lot of viewers.Wyatt makes one of the most ambiguous comments after the Mardi Gras scene and he was back on the road, We blew it. By we was Wyatt simply referring to him and Billy? There is evidence for that view. The acid trip in New Orleans looked to me like a real downer. Maybe Wyatt was expressing regret about the drug deal and how he had funded the trip at the expense of an element of society that was not compatible with his philosophy? He had made the comment that it was hard to be free in a society where one's worth was determined in the marketplace. Since easy rider is slang for a person indirectly living off of prostitution, perhaps the drug deal made Wyatt an easy rider in that since, rather than the ease with which he rode his bike. Also, Wyatt was surely not without guilt about the death of George and how easily they just left him behind.By we did Wyatt mean the counterculture movement? If that movement was to bring peace and love, those were not much in evidence in what they encountered as they entered the deep south. Even the visit to the commune was a depressing affair. It was abundantly clear that that was not going to make it by depending on its own resources. One of the saddest scenes was seeing commune members tossing seeds onto the dusty soil with the desire to grow simple food for simple people. Even Billy recognized the inevitable ill outcome of this when he asked, You guys ever get any rain?By we did Wyatt mean the United States? The fact that his nickname was Captain America and he wore a leather jacket with a large American flag on it would argue for this. It's hard to know what Wyatt was expecting from his trip, but his experiences would imply that he did not find it. He met discrimination, saw poverty, and wound up with a bust of an experience in New Orleans. Given their appearance and and their mode of transportation the guys would have to have been pretty naive not to realize that they would not be welcomed with open arms in the rural south.Playing Wyatt was not much more demanding of Peter Fonda than he just look serious and say a few lines. Dennis Hopper had no trouble playing the stoned hippie to the point where you figured he was just being himself. But he had to be more than that in order to have directed this effort using some creative techniques and supporting it with a great rock soundtrack. It is Jack Nicholson who turns in the star performance as George. He creates a sympathetic character that is hard not to like. I could understand his wanting to burst out of his unhappy existence by getting a taste of freedom.In the end I came to see this as a condemnation of the small-minded thinking that fears what is different and can react only with a desire to destroy it. A great amount of the suffering in the history of mankind has been the result of just that thinking.

The story is a simple one Fresh off a lucrative drug deal, a pair of bikers travel from L.A. to New Orleans trying to make it in time for Mardi Gras. Along the way, they experience then-contemporary America in its many forms.The film is essentially a 'road movie', so the plot is more or less secondary. Yet, while there are several sequences of the two protagonists travelling to the classic sounds of Steppenwolf, the Band & others, the backbone of the story is an Oscar-nominated script that provides thoughtful commentary on post-Summer of Love America.The acting is pretty good, too; especially considering that this was a low-budget affair that utilized a number of non-actors. Stars Peter Fonda & Dennis Hopper showed obvious authenticity while Jack Nicholson shone in his breakout (not to mention Oscar-nominated) performance. In general, the cast was well-assembled and populated with some distinctive individuals.Dennis Hopper's direction is solid and some of his artistic flourishes show the influence of European stylists. That being said, some of his techniques might come across as a bit excessive (at least they did to me). Musically, the film is exceptional in its selection of contemporary rock tunes. There are several classics featured and even the relative obscurities are memorable.Perhaps, if you're the sort of person who can't abide dated material, Easy Rider may not be for you. Personally, I see it as a fascinating time capsule showing both the optimism of the peace & love movement along with the disillusionment left in its wake.

George rides with Wyatt, and whilst stopping to camp out, they get George, who is hard on his liquor, to try marijuana. the three of them stop at a small restaurant, where there are on-lookers, including local men and a police officer making mocking, racist, and homophobic remarks against them right from the get-go. from there, the police officer gathers his men to stop them from leaving town, so just as they think they are free, they catch up to them.I won't mention what happens then, but it certainly has one of those unexpected endings, and a rather silly one at that. one of those films with a message, with the observation that Americans talk a lot about the value of freedom, but are actually afraid of anyone who truly exhibits it. that is true, as has been the case with Americans, however, the problem that I had with it is that some of the scenes were too over-the-top, and disturbing, like in the scene with the two prostitutes, that really didn't need to be in the film.

Easy Rider combines a perfect balance of mesmerizing scenery with an amazing soundtrack, almost making it more of an experience than a film.

There was a war, and people were angry, and Easy Rider answered the people's anger. Dennis Hopper and Peter Fonda were two hippies doing what they wants, regardless of what people thought of them. They made friends with the town drunk, smoke marijuana, in a time where it was both looked down on and widely popular, and took a road trip. This was a time where the adults and non-hippies of the time would look down on mindless road trips - that is not something you are supposed to do - but Hopper and Fonda spoke to a generation telling them that it was okay to do what you want - free spirit is a gift, so don't waste it.

This is Easy Rider's real trip, not at all dated, or if it is, it's dated in a way that really captures the swirling drug culture of the late 1960s.

Both failed to get where they wanted to go. They were not understood by the rest of society so what resulted was growing dislike for both. The filming of the movie was done mainly outdoors under a low budget. Open landscape shots were placed to emphasize the idea of having nothing holding on to you thus creating the feeling of freedom.

This film embodies freedom. Touring the country on motorcycles, with an open mind and only the clothes on their back. This is a great fantasy of mine, and is one I plan to fulfill this summer with my best friend. I believe that my generation ( i am 20 years old ), is up against a lot more than we can possibly imagine. We stay hidden behind our computers, cell phones, and video games. I am guilty of using these means of technology but i strongly advocate the willingness to act and to live. Instead of living life through a computer screen ( like the majority does ) I believe one should take to the open road, get submerged in nature, rough it, and explore all that is out there. This movie really captures it, it speaks it, it speaks what was going on during that time period and the desperate need for change. The breaking of traditional, poisonous views, and getting in touch with all that is real. A personal conquest for truth is something my generation should be more focused on. We as a generation need another revolution and need to do so following in the footsteps of the 1960's generation, but learning from their mistakes, and striving for originality, instead of living off the table scraps of what conspired almost 50 years ago. This movie should be an inspiration for minds like mine, minds in search of freedom and truth. Escaping the clutches of society and discovering oneself is essential. Rotting away on a couch, submerged in the glow of a computer screen is poison, and the quicker my generation comes to that realization, the quicker we will get to forming a revolt against our current conditions. This movie is actually quite perfect for my generation. I know for me, it was certainly motivational and inspiring to watch. Many ignorant man alike quickly pass movies like this off as being just another hippy, drug infested, dreamer movie. Many still laugh at those in search of truth, but i think the message behind this film is way greater than what is often perceived. The message falls deaf on the years of those not in tune. Sadly, the majority of my generation are tuned out, too busy with updating their status on facebook and catching the latest episode of  jersey shore , to realize the shape our country is in and the complete and udder filth that is occurring on a daily basis in Washington. I recommend this film to the liberated mind, to the dreamers, and to those who missed or jumped off the bandwagon of our culture today. And even if you are apart of the sad culture that is of today, you should put down your cell phone long enough to let this film soak in, watch it twice if need be.

Another very famous movie Hopper starred in is an example of reality in cinema that still becomes a realistic phantasmagoria in Southeast Asia. That, of course being Apocalypse Now. I don't watch horror so I cannot comment on Texas Chainsaw Massacre(but I might). Commentary is all this essay really is, yet much has been said and will continue to be said about Easy Rider. I say Easy Rider has no personality because the film is actually a documentary, in most ways. The footage of everything that goes on in this classic is the telling of a journey, and that is all. It's been called the essence of the 60's more times than the fans took something at Yasgur's farm. Everyone at Woodstock did not trip or get drunk, but those times were ending, the end of a decade. That jam was at the very end of the 1960's and Easy Rider was made at the very same time. Easy Rider was a Columbia movie, directed and produced by the two main actors in it. But why I say the movie was less a motion picture is that the actors were so, so natural. It was like a documentary, but from the inside instead of the outside. The screenplay does not serve to be entertaining, or to shock, or to cause the viewer to judge. The lines, the filming, all that just is. No point is being made. The commune is viewed by Hopper and Fonda(as director and producer) honestly and openly. The relationships between everyone who lived there are as if seen in a documentary with no narrative. It is not like watching a National Geographic show where the meerkats interact and play and then Hopper chops up the whole herd with a chain saw. Like a bushwhacker. No one at the commune in Easy Rider seems to be in a hurry, and it appears that they are living on and with the land. The story of Captain America and Billy is quite different. The commune is a stop along the way, and so is another less enchanting place where they meet Jack Nicholson. Billy is throughout the movie the type who believes in living for the minute, and ironically Billy is a worrier, a whiner, and a complainer. Captain America is quite a different kind of person, a thinker, a planner, a guy with a clear head. Even though they are both criminals headed for a first hearing and beyond, Captain America is soft-spoken, thoughtful, and really considerate, especially on their first stop at a charitable farmer's place. As the two bikers continue their odyssey(the viewer's)Karen Black later enters the picture with her stirring and provocative eyes, and the movie begins taking on a more psychedelic quality at that point. A first rate blast from the past, Easy Rider clocks in at 95 minutes.

The film still holds up well enough on the road, where the soundtrack and cinematography were used to good advantage, but shows its age whenever the two anti-heroes park their choppers and start talking, with Peter Fonda (as 'Captain America') nodding his head and saying things like, I can dig time, and Dennis Hopper, playing the fool, doing his best to improvise while under a dope-induced fog (it's hard to imagine him sober enough to function as a director). The film's enormous popularity was in large part an accident of timing, arriving as it did at a moment when young audiences were ready and willing to tune in, turn on, and drop out. Surprisingly, the tragic ending suggested a pessimism far ahead of its time, admitting the failure of a generation doomed by its own addiction to freedom. "},{"Title":"in search of the 'real' America","Date":"1 November 2010","Score":"","Genre":"Adventure, Drama","Review":" In 1969, George Lazenby refused to play 'James Bond' in more than one movie because he felt 007 was finished, and that films like 'Easy Rider' represented the future of cinema. We can laugh now, but at that time it seemed a reasonable forecast. Audiences were tired of bloated, big budget extravaganzas and looked around for smaller, more intimate films about people. 'Easy Rider' came along at the right time. 'Biily' ( the late Dennis Hopper ) and 'Wyatt' ( Peter Fonda ) are two young men with motorbikes who, after purchasing 'grass', set off on an epic journey across the country, ostensibly heading for the New Orleans Mardi Gras. The film is primarily about their adventures. We find out little about them themselves - where they are from, what they did before, where their families are and so on - and do not really need to know. Billy looks like a cowboy ( with hat and drooping moustache ) while Wyatt thinks of himself as 'Captain America' ( and wears a flag on his back ). They take a strange hitch-hiker ( Luke Askew ) back to his commune, only for him to become unexpectedly hostile. They then gatecrash the carnival and are thrown into jail, where they meet George Hansen ( Jack Nicholson ), a drunken lawyer. In the film's funniest scene, around a campfire, George smokes grass while talking at length about aliens from outer space ( is this where Bryce Zabel got the idea for 'Dark Skies' from, one wonders? ).As was the case with Richard Rush's 'Psych-Out' ( 1968 ), the counter culture is depicted here as the norm. When Billy, Wyatt and George go into a restaurant, they are subjected to intolerant abuse from the locals, and quietly leave. But these red necks have not finished with them and beat them up as they sleep, killing George in the process. Taking his money, Billy and Wyatt enjoy a good meal and the company of two attractive hookers - Karen ( Karen Black ) and Mary ( Toni Basil ). The climax in which Billy and Wyatt are killed by a driver for no other reason that they have long hair shocks even now.Produced by Fonda and directed by Hopper, 'Easy Rider' was intended to be about a country in decline. Audiences responded differently; in New Orleans, they applauded the climax while elsewhere sympathy went to the murdered bikers.This could have been in lesser hands an aimless movie about people with nothing much to do but ride bikes but as partly written by the brilliant Terry Southern, it emerges as a sheer delight. The bitter tone of the film is complemented by its humour, mostly provided by Nicholson. You could see here that a superstar was waiting to happen.Mention 'Easy Rider' to most and the chances are the first thing they'll think of is the sight of Hopper and Fonda roaring along dusty roads to the sound of 'Born To Be Wild' by Steppenwolf. The other songs used work equally well. Magnificent photography from Laszlo Kovacs. It was a deserved hit then, and remains the best of its genre - the 'road' movie. "},{"Title":"Wyatt and Billy Ride Again...","Date":"11 July 2010","Score":"","Genre":"Adventure, Drama","Review":" Like many classic movies and books, Easy Rider has become victim to the historical elements of it's era. Today's young adult probably does not remember a time when smoking pot, hitting LSD, and open sex were more main stream and not as much counterculture. When truth be told, there was a time when a major part of our society smoked pot like people go to Starbucks today. Also, this movie was made during the reformation of the Black South. It is for these reasons that the movie seems to push the subject of drug use and the issues of bigotry to the level of hyperbole by today's standards. Interestly, the theme of drug usage by the main characters conveys a means of becoming more in tune with the moment, instead of trying to escape from any type of adverse reality. In other words, pot usage is not portrayed as any evil nor is it worshiped as a type of panacea(I am not soap boxing here-just observing).The heroes Wyatt and Billy seem to live by their own amoral code outside the law(and thus the irony of their names). They sell cocaine to fund their adventure to New Orleans. What is refreshing about the story is that neither the drug sale or subsequent usage inspire greed, violence, retribution, or war on some type of moral code and/or legal dogma. Their actions are a means of becoming something and getting somewhere with no intent of harm to anyone else. I don't know if there is any noble cause at steak, but one does get a real Robin Hood type of feel for the story and characters. It would be hard to imagine a movie done today with this theme without some type of condemnation in part or in whole of the drug scene.In a nutshell, I think that the magic of this movie is that Hopper was able to make a statement about American society at that time without using standard political jargon used today as his framework for the story. Easy Rider wasn't about war, but it was about peace man. Easy Rider was made in a time when the story was written by those who relished living outside of the conventional political, authoritative and commercial system...Freedom maybe?

But I was very wrong to do so. It's just one of those movies that grabs you early on and doesn't let go. Everything moves slowly and yet their sublimely surreal day to day life experience and the fantastic scenery keeps you hooked. Hopper, Fonda & Nicholson combine brilliantly to flesh out what could have been a very bare stark dull story. It's amazing what they managed to come up considering the relatively low budget and their constant very drug addled state! Definitely one for every movie collection. I particularly liked the scenes involving 'locals' who were openly evil with their hostility, fear and hatred of anything non conforming. The tension oozes off the screen in those scenes and it's so markedly different to the scenes involving the mellow laid back yet undeniable wild drifters, Fonda & Hopper. The music is great too.

But thank god I stuck with it! The style doesn't change after that mark, but for some reason it grasps you. You really appreciate it. A lot of that has to do with OUTSTANDING acting by Peter Fonda, Jack Nicholson, and Dennis Hopper. Hopper especially puts up a fantastic performance in a Lee Marvin esquire role.While the film dives into the relationships and places the two biker buddies encounter on a road to New Orleans, the movie really shines on the journey from stop to stop. The best parts of Rider are the scenes where the two stars roam the streets through beautiful western locations. The scenes are that much more special due to an outstanding soundtrack.The film making was, however, a little shaky. One problem I had was the over use of the off-and-on shutter transition from scenes. The multiple angles and takes when picking up the hitch hiker was confusing. But as a director, Hopper did include some great moments including picking the landscape and his work with the LSD scene.At the beginning of the movie you really feel like Fonda and Hopper are going to be stabbing rebels. But as it goes along you experience a revelation and realize they're anything but. You really feel for these characters and in return they make you feel free for 100 minutes. Jack Nicholson also provides some amazing lines, and definitely is responsible for creating a masterpiece moment when discussing UFOs, the scenes strongest scene.

Also the message of freedom and the lack of it during the '60's in the U.S.. I thought this movie was absolutely amazing. The film used the two main motorcycle riding characters to represent an entire generation while representing the traditional folk who the cyclists were raised by with representation from every person the cyclists meet along their way to their destination. The people that they meet throughout the journey though not only represent the previous generation, but they also represent the resistance to change that many established generations have felt. They feel that when the youth are attempting to change society for the better or worse.

Also, a big issue for me was the lack of dialogue. I understand that they may have wanted to make it seem like a very free, easy going lifestyle for the two main characters. So, I don't judge their choice I mean sometimes in life their just simply are no need for words. I just simply prefer to hear things and have the story develop.

I appreciate the views that Dennis hopper give you as the director of the film. Hopper did a fantastic job of following Captain America and Billy throughout the southwest and south in a journey to find freedom and in time whatever it is that they were looking for. It was also quinessential to see the interaction between Billy, Captain America and their new friend George Hanson played by Jack Nicklaus. After getting them released from jail and telling him they are going New Orleans, George decides to tag along. This is when he comes across marijuana for the first time. At first he is afraid because it leads to harder stuff but eventually trys it. This scene is so great because it truly mimics the life of what a pot smoker is, smoking and often losing the cherry on the joint due to the fact that he could not stop talking. It showed a liberation of themselves and truly adds to the depth of the movie. Without the interaction from a Non-freedom rider, you truly get to see Captain America and Billy in a light that you don't see when their just together. Their radical movement to be free and eventually escape to what there looking for puts them in some bad predicaments and eventually their demise. Easy Rider is very influential to me and I'm sure the people of that time who were looking to find a way to be Free.

The way the film is shot is very gritty, the sets seemed mostly locations shoots in the deserts of the West and small town regions near New Orleans. The people that the two main characters run into seem to symbolize the different ideologies of the the time. At first the two run into a hippie hitchhiking and then into a town full of conservative and more closed minded individuals. For a good portion of the film body language and then use of eye contact is used between the main characters and other characters but it effectively gets its point across. Wyatt, played by Peter Fonda, is the more thoughtful and philosophical of the two and there are many shots of him deep in thought. While Billy, played by Dennis Hopper is the goofier one, added comic relief at times. Many of the scenes in the film are quite shocking, the scene where the townspeople come and bludgeon Jack Nicholson's character to death was a bit disturbing but comes in third to the drawn out psychedelic drug use scene and the finals scenes in which the Wyatt and Billy are gunned down the some men who murdered their companion just days before.

Besides, the director uses extreme close-up to present the details of the motorcycle while he was putting the money in the motorcycle. There are many good musics(nondiegetic sound) performed while they were ridding the motorcycles; this gives the feeling as they open music during driving a car. In addition, the director tries to photograph while they were ridding in many directions, so widescreen is very suitable for this situation because the camera can cover two motorcycles, and the audiences would be able to see more views of the background, especially the natural views such as mountain, and it is really good for the parade scene too because the audiences can see the performance. Moreover, the director uses technique to switch the last shot and the next shot(flash-forward) back and ford so that two shots would be more continuity. Furthermore, almost every scene is photographed from the real place, so this is cheaper than arranging in a studio. Besides, the artificial light is seldom used; the light of each scene is from natural light. These help reduce the budget to make the movie. Lastly, in the scene that the riders climb up to the small hill in the evening, and the audiences can see them look like shadow; I think it is very arts.

It could create a judgment that all southerners hate hippies and more liberated people. I am not really sure what the point of the killing was, besides the fact that we know they were discriminated against because of how they looked. If there was more talking in this movie between the characters I feel more people would be able to better understand the hidden meanings and messages of the movie that are not so obvious to pick up on.

As a square he soon shows that for all the differences people are the same (the way he reaches for his flask just as naturally as the counter-culture reached for their joints).This movie opened the door for directors to take quite a bit of power away from the producers in the industry.

The film is about two bikers (Peter Fonda) and (Jack Nicholson) who are traveling across the country trying to find America. The film starts off with the two men scoring dope in Mexico and selling to a rich man in Los Angeles for a lot of cash. They then buy some California Choppers and set across the country to New Orleans in search of freedom. In the scene where they get the bikes Peter Fonda looks at his watch and throws it to the ground representing freedom of time. They then drive across the desert and the song Born to Be Wild kicks in. They go to a vacant motel and ask for a room when the man sees them he turns on the No Vacancy which leads to them sleeping outside around a campfire smoking pot and talking about interesting things, this first scene portrays in all of the other scenes how they lodge. These scenes to me are the best scenes in the movie because it shows that the narrow minded people at that time were scared of the new lifestyle of these people thus people thinking they are outlaws or bad people while in turn they are. Peter Fonda is the cool, mellow, laid back guy who is looking for what America really is, but in this he really isn't part of any group of people he is the outsider, the observer. Who never really is accepted but instead is trying to find himself. Dennis Hopper is the sidekick, the fool, who is a more paranoid fast paced man, who looks more at life as living it to the fullest. The two drive through the west and then meet a hitchhiker where they then spend the night at an Indian burial ground and smoke a lot of pot. To me this scene is the best campfire scene, of how the wind is blowing and they are talking, it seems so serious and meaningful and yet goofy and fun. The hitchhiker takes them to a commune where hippies are living together trying to grow food for themselves and live off the land. Billy (Dennis Hopper) is getting impatient of the commune and wants to hit the road to Mardi Gras. While Wyatt ( Peter Fonda) thinks life on the commune is good and that is how people should live, but goes along with Billy. Before they leave the hitchhiker gives Fonda acid and tells him to use this at the right place with the right people. Fonda takes it and off they go, they then get to a small town and drive in the parade. The sheriff arrests them saying they didn't have a permit for parading thus them ending up in the jail. They meet George Hanson (Jack Nicholson) in there cell a drunken lawyer who ends up in jail a lot of the time. They tell Goerge they are going to Mardi Gras and he is interested in going but says he cant. Fonda tells him he should and they give him a helmet and he goes with them. Nicholson is the lovable, drunken, American, opposite of Billy and Wyatt but is curious and accepts them unlike his counterparts. They travel on the road and then the scene changes and it is another campfire scene, this scene quite possibly being one of the most denying moments in the counterculture of the 60's showing about the old ways to the new. Nicholson drinks his whiskey Fonda tells him to do this instead. Nicholson thinking it a hand rolled cigarette is actually a marijuana joint. Nicholson is hesitant but is reluctant and takes the joint. This scene is probably the most defining moment about drugs and such. They then hit Louisana where they go into a dinner, the locals have never seen anyone like them, and are making insulting jokes about them. They don't get there food and Nicholson decides to leave they leave and go on. At the campfire scene after that Nicholson talks about freedom where people who live it are feared and people that don't live but say they have it are dangerous this is an important scene since it shows people who are free and people who think they have freedom while really they are not free at all. At night while they are sleeping the hicks from the dinner come and kill Nicholson with a machete and hurting the other two. The hicks were smart not to kill Billy and Wyatt so they could frame it on them and make them look like criminals. They then go to New Orleans where Wyatt is uncertain about things and seems lost and unhappy about what America was. They hit Mardi Gras and go to a whorehouse where they and two women go into the streets and then go to a cemetery resulting in the acid scene. Then cutting off with both of them hitting the road and probably going to Florida. At the last campfire scene Wyatt his sad and says to Billy they blew it the last words in the film. They then drive the next day and see two hicks where one of them jokingly puts a gun to Billy, Billy flicks him off and he gets mad and shoots Billy. Wyatt goes back to him and is going to get help, yet the truck turns around and he is shot and dies. The ending shot goes from them on the ground to the air. The music in this film was great, and the life of the hippies, and shows Americans darker side to a real context. When I first saw this film it changed my ways of thinking and living. i think this film was one of the most important films in America.

The movie just chronicles who they meet and the adventures they have along the way. Among the more notable ones are George Hanson (Jack Nicholson in the role that made him a star) as an alcoholic lawyer and Karen Black (!) and Toni Basil as hookers.This film was a HUGE box office hit when it came out. It was the first film that young kids in America saw that really depicted them as they were--and felt. It also almost destroyed Hollywood too when all the studios tried to copy it and came out with some of the worst most self-indulgent films ever made. Basically the older men running the studios couldn't make heads or tails out of this and just threw anything dealing with young people on the screen.This has been overpraised over the years. It is a VERY good film (I'm giving it 8 stars) with some incredible wide-screen photography and a great rock soundtrack...but it has a very depressing ending and doesn't really say anything. There are a lot of interesting insights in the conversations among Wyatt, Billy and George but these insights are pretty dated now. However, back in 1968, they may have been considered deep. It is worth catching though from a historical standpoint and as the first film (and the best) to deal with the kids in the late 1960s and what they were going through.

"},{"Title":"Easy riders and easy morals.","Date":"15 December 2008","Score":"","Genre":"Adventure, Drama","Review":" Easy Rider to me, is a film about ignorance and the cataclysmic consequences it can have. The film centres on two characters, both of whom are the quintessential view of a middle-class conservative (American in particular) of what being free (and freedom itself) means, namely, an obnoxious, dope smoking and long-haired lazy drifter. Dennis Hopper's Billy is that very man and a slightly less obnoxious, more-open minded dope smoking, long haired, lazy drifter, or Wyatt, played by Peter Fonda.After a successful drug deal which involves exploiting several hundred Mexicans (no trouble there then, why break the habits of a lifetime), they cast off their obligations (Wyatt's dumping of his watch) and hit the road heading East on a coast-coast bike ride. They compromise their obligations from the get-go by their need of the dollar, for gas and supplies, therefore to be free in the USA you need money, in other words you can't be. Wyatt and Billy as far as being free go, enjoy their own commercially-funded status symbols e.g. their noisy choppers, leather gear and hope to retire in Florida.Tests to their freedom occur frequently, such as their reliance on their bikes and their own complete lack of knowledge in how to fix them. When Wyatt gets a flat, with little more than a patronising acknowledgement to his far more skilled-superior, and ultimately more independent and free man, their flat is fixed and both are fed without charge. Little is made of this but it is surely a critique of the free and wealthy Wyatt and Billy who extend little kindness to their fellow man. Is being free, the freedom to be an obnoxious buffoon, or a selfish, exploitative obnoxious buffoon? One key demonstration of kindness (necessary from a plot development idea, but out of character) is extended to what seems to be a lonely drifter, but is actually the head of a hippie commune. Wyatt and Billy view the commune's surroundings with undisguised contempt, but one of the members of the commune falls in love with Wyatt and offers him (for me anyway) the true concept of freedom, the freedom to be in love and (in my opinion again) our only real freedom in a generally unfree world.Wyatt's later acknowledgement that we blew it surely refers to this. Wyatt may also recall the fact that he and Billy have enough money to save the commune from certain death (by installing an irrigation system to save the commune's soon-to-die crops), but he was too easily fooled by his money and his greed.My view of this film is clear, Wyatt and Billy are criticised for a narrow-minded view of freedom and even when freedom (the hippie commune) appears in front of them (in the flesh of two pretty women) they don't see it, partly because they are both too stoned and partly because they are too stupid, similarly their ultimate nemeses display similar levels of self-destructive ignorance.Jack Nicholson's character for me is totally out of place in the film. His introduction, stay and departure are really only diversions from the two lead actors and Jack's involvement doesn't even serve to act as a link-man. He appears, tags along and his death does nothing to prevent Wyatt and Billy from travelling on. They don't even appear to go back into town to call the police.About the film techniques, some of the techniques, strange forms of editing are very poorly done and subsequently have no consequence in plot development and are therefore a waste. Much of the film is B-Movie and exploitation-like, the landscapes, the mountains, the people in the cafe, the poor black people waving from their horrible tin huts, the Mardi Gras celebrations and is therefore a movie full of clichés, but the essentially story is powerful and has a phenomenal final 10 minutes, that make for a very watchable film, even today. "}{"Title":"Says a lot about the counterculture, and not all of it is good.","Date":"1 September 2008","Score":"","Genre":"Adventure, Drama","Review":" More like a time capsule than a typical feature film, Easy Rider takes the viewer back to the late 1960s in America. For those of us who were not living at this time, the ideals of the film are still easy enough to understand. Made on a virtually non-existent budget, this motorcycle road picture plays out like a drug induced trip. The earlier stages more relaxed like the effects of pot, and the latter stages playing out like a bad LSD trip. Drugs are pretty much the central theme here. Not so much the attempt to live in freedom. That's the thing about the counterculture. It may have started up as a true rebellion to a conformist society, but ultimately the drugs became the central theme. Not just a side story.The story is very simple. A couple of dudes played by Dennis Hopper and Peter Fonda make a drug deal with a guy in a limo played by Phil Spector. They use the profits to take a trip to Mardi Gras. Along the way they meet all sorts of odd characters, and not all of them are friendly. The guys pick up a hitchhiker and he leads them into a hippie commune that really looks like an awful place to be. There is nothing about this commune that is glorified. Hopper, who plays many of his scenes like he is tripping, seems mortified by these people and just wants them to get back on the road. Fonda seems much more laid back and comfortable in this and just about any environment he is presented with. Next, the two are arrested for disrupting a parade in a tiny town. They meet up with Jack Nicholson's drunken alcoholic character in jail, and he ends up joining them (all too briefly) on their trip. Once the guys get to rural Louisiana, they encounter some angry rednecks in a diner and things go downhill from there. There is a really odd acid trip that gets filmed in a cemetery in New Orleans that is effective, but it really doesn't add anything to the plot. Once Mardi Gras is left behind the party is basically over in more ways than one for our heroes. The tragic conclusion is not hard to see coming.Easy Rider is a film made by some obviously drugged up individuals. It is at its best when an old song is playing while the guys are driving through some very beautiful American scenery. Whenever anyone gets off the bikes and talks, the film drags... literally! Because all anyone seems to do is take drags off joints! Not much of the dialog in this film had much meaning to me. Nicholson has some good lines, and Fonda's remark toward the end saying, We blew it, Billy is prophetic, not only about their own predicament, but also the counterculture in general. These people all started out with some big ideals, but in the end, it was the drugs that ruined it for them.This film is not for all tastes. If you don't have an attention span, and you probably know who you are, then don't try to watch it. If you are interested in the late 1960s and the counterculture, then you will probably like it. I see the film as an interesting time capsule with a few glaring faults. But it will remain talked about and watched for years and years to come. In many ways it is a landmark of American pop culture. 8 of 10 stars.The Hound.

The direction by Dennis Hopper is often times sloppy and drenched with the era's pretentiousness. Its admirable and original that he wanted to bring the nouvelle vogue style associated with Jean-Luc Goddard to a counterculture film, but he isn't really able to pull it off. To be honest, his overlooked Out of the Blue is a much more satisfactory effort from him and proves he had a great deal of directorial talent. Also, with the exception of Jack Nicholson's revelatory turn, the acting is pretty weak as well. Peter Fonda was an icon to be sure, but hes often wooden and his character comes across as annoyingly self-righteous. Hopper is even worse, often comically over-the-top as the paranoid stoner.You know what though? All this hardly matters. Despite not being a film brimming with technical brilliance, its easy to see why this is regarded as a classic and effected a whole generation (not to mention Hollywood). It perfectly captures the ennui of the hippie era, its idealism and its depression due to the state of chaos the world was in. The deconstruction of the American dream here remains very powerful and sticks with the viewer. Years after you've forgotten the fact that Easy Rider isn't expertly made, its central themes stay with you. The film's more downbeat moments also counteract some of the endless and shallow idealism of the era. In addition to that, its still a very cool and enjoyable film to watch with a great soundtrack. Easy Rider, despite its technical shortcomings, is a highly recommended and important film. (8/10) "},{"Title":"The best counterculture film of our time. And the breakout and well deserved role for Jack Nicholson.","Date":"20 April 2007","Score":"","Genre":"Adventure, Drama","Review":" 1969's Easy Rider continues to entertain generation after generation, and I can see why because it challenged authority during the rebellious 60's a tough time in U.S. culture. You have two Los Angeles(L.A.) outlaw and drug snorting, grass smoking hippie bikers who are played very well by Peter Fonda and Dennis Hopper who decide to venture across the west from L.A. to New Orleans in search of fun and a good time! Along the way the stretches of highway have many stops, but the best and most important part of the film are when they land in jail and encounter a young and intelligent southern lawyer(played to perfection by Nicholson and certainly his breakout role!) who decides to accompany them on the road journey of fun and freedom to New Orleans, I just love the quote that Nicholson's lawyer character says after leaving jail when telling the two bikers about a Louisana prostitution house it was These ain't no pork chops, these are U.S. prime! as the bikes roll on they encounter doom, and the Nichoslon character has a fatal ending, it's a shame because his young intelligent lawyer character was so likable, but was killed because he was different and had befriended two bikers and to me he had became the hero of this film. The fun and feel of freedom is found in New Orleans, only to have the establishment end it on the journey home.Overall Easy Rider is a film classic that took on the establishment of the 60's showing us a new hippie culture even though it is overblown with drugs these characters were just trying to show a new type and different kind of freedom. Also finally after many years of being in Roger Corman works and many B type horror movies, this finally turned out to be Jack Nicholson's breakout role that was much well deserved. Nicholson is perfect as an intelligent and likable southern lawyer George Hanson. And during the film the camera angles and montage scenes that flash are well done, plus the music played just makes the film move along so well with the background of the western U.S. this film is picture perfect. Easy Rider is certainly the best counterculture film of our time it was made to stand up against the 60's establishment and this movie did show a different kind of generation of freedom and new hippie culture showing that's it's OK to be different. "},{"Title":"Oh, it was not an 'easy' ride.","Date":"3 February 2006","Score":"","Genre":"Adventure, Drama","Review":" Nolan Sutherland Special Topics in Film Prof. Niemi 2 February 2005The 1969 film Easy Rider, directed by Dennis Hopper, was released in one of the most tumultuous years of the century, and realizing this helps solidify many of the themes in the movie. At the time, the war in Vietnam was raging on with increasing American casualties, Lyndon B. Johnson was fighting for diplomacy and peace, and the country was engulfed in an all-around state of unrest and chaos. This year truly set the scene for a movie like Easy Rider. It is a story of two bikers, Wyatt (a.k.a. Captain America) and Billy, on a voyage of freedom living out the counterculture lifestyle, and their adventures from the west coast to the streets of New Orleans for Mardi Gras, and eventually Florida.The opening of the film really gets the counterculture ball rolling with a cocaine deal and the rock and roll song Pusher Man. The viewer is thrown right into Wyatt and Billys' lives of rebellion against society and the law, and the freedoms of being a biker. These freedoms include illicit drug use, promiscuity, and the calling of the open road, which are all accented in the movie with songs like Born to Be Wild. As the two are making their way on the road they encounter many distractions, which are anything but that to them. At one point they stop to fix their bikes on a farm and there is a scene that shows, and even compares, the bikers and a couple of farmers/cowboys. This is interesting because it gives insight to the characterization of Wyatt and Billy, which can be inferred as them being modern cowboys. The farmers are shoeing their horse while Wyatt and Billy are tending to their rides, their motorcycles.The boys return to their journey, and along the way pick up a hippie hitchhiker. It is at this point where one can decipher a difference in character between the two bikers. Wyatt completely trusts the hitchhiker with his bike (even though the money stash is in his fuel tank) and believes the hitchhiker will in turn respect him. On the flip, Billy is paranoid of the hitchhiker's intentions and is untrusting. He seems to be a negative product of the hippie idealism, which was due to his freedom and drugs use he has become paranoid and a loose cannon. This reveals that although the two are lumped into the same societal group, they still have their differences. Next, they make their way to a commune where the hitchhiker resides. This part of the movie gives a real insight into the lifestyle of the hippie, and even gives a sense of what life would be like if that lifestyle took over. Wyatt and Billy may be part of the counterculture, but it is illustrated here that the two are not quite hippies, rather just free spirits looking for their true freedom. This contrast between the two groups may seem blurred, but the film evokes a feeling of difference between the two groups that is hard to put into words. The bikers' next temporary companion is George Hanson, whom they meet in jail. Wyatt and Billy end up in the pen because they insert themselves into a town parade, which again outlines their state of mind which is if we're not hurting anyone, why can't we do it? They end up taking George along with them, and in effect opening him up to their world. George plays the role of bridging the gap between the counterculture and the mainstream of the south, and in turn he gets so caught up in the bikers' lifestyle that it costs him his life. He was the sacrifice of the clash between the two forces. This clash is what ultimately ends Wyatt and Billy's journey. The two mix with the south like oil mixes with water. No matter what, southern traditionalists would never mingle or even accept the two's lifestyle, and this societal polarization would climax with their death. While riding along a road a shotgun is pulled on them by two redneck duck poachers, and the two don't have a chance of even defending themselves. The movies' abrupt ending was done brilliantly, I believe, because Wyatt and Billy were perfectly captured in the movie, and their demise immortalizes the roles they played in 1968. "},{"Title":"Easy Rider Not Easy Viewing","Date":"2 February 2006","Score":"","Genre":"Adventure, Drama","Review":" The film Easy Rider, starring Denis Hopper and Peter Fonda, was a very different kind of film for its time. There were many scenes of drug use, LSD trips, and violence that would have shocked American culture at that time. The movie begins with a drug deal and continues from there into the depths of American culture.The view of America during the sixties was very interesting to watch through the eyes of these hippies. The images portrayed were very real. There were the poor families living in shacks contrasted with the beautiful mountainsides and rivers as they traveled along the open road. The music played adds to the feeling of loneliness and the desire for freedom. It seems as though during their journey they travel far, but never really get anywhere. Along the way they meet several interesting characters. Jack Nicholson plays an alcoholic southern man and plays it very convincingly. I thought his character, George Hanson, was the best in the film even though he does not develop much past the alcoholic that we meet him as, but neither do Wyatt or Billy come any further then druggies. Around the campfire is the only time we really see the men talk philosophically, most of the time drug-induced, but nonetheless gives us a look into their heads.This movie is full of contrasting images. In the beginning Wyatt and Billy pull over to eat and they put their motorcycles in the barn. While they are adjusting their wheels we see an older man in the background hammering a horseshoe, showing the difference between the old and new generations. Also there are images of Billy and Wyatt while they are on the road that are very telling. Peter Fonda, who plays Wyatt, is always out in front while Dennis Hopper, Billy, lags slightly behind. There are times when he tries to ride right alongside Wyatt but these moments last only a short time. When the three men stop in a restaurant there are three tables staring at them and making comments. At one table there is a cop with another man and they are suspicious of their long hair and motorcycles. Next we see a table full of teenage girls that are fascinated by them. This again shows the generation gap that was present during the sixties.There are several different filming techniques in this movie as well. At first when watching the film you may think the DVD is skipping as the scenes flash from the present to a future scene, but this is how they change scenes a lot of the time, which has an interesting effect. They are in a constant state of confusion and trips so the viewer is made to feel this way as well. The graveyard scene is another example of this. Billy and Wyatt escape into Mardi Gras with two prostitutes, where the images become hazy and blurred, possibly due to the 16mm film that was used, finally arriving at a graveyard. Here they drink and do drugs for what seems like days. The stark religious images are abrupt and unexpected. They, and we, are literally bombarded with these images as they experience the highs and lows of a trip. It is a very interesting and disturbing sequence that probably was very revolutionary for the time. The film ends in violence, and the lives of these two freedom seeking hippies end as well. "},{"Title":"Freedom vs. imprisonment, a satire of America in the late 1960's","Date":"1 February 2006","Score":"","Genre":"Adventure, Drama","Review":" Scott Greenan February 3, 2006 New American Cinema Easy RiderEasy Rider is a film that not only expresses a truly American sub-culture in the late 1960's, but also satires the modern American way of life. One of the first scenes we are introduced to includes the stuffing of money into a motorcycle gas tank. What caught my eye was that the gas tank was the American flag. The placing of drug money into the American flag shows this nation's excessive greed and dependence on money, not to mention its drug-peddling sub-culture. However, this image seemed to disappear because the money was hardly ever talked about, or shown again. The film began as a comparison to the westernized cowboy movies. Their bikes were visually compared to horses throughout the movie. When a tire blew, it had to be replaced, an image that was compared to the changing of a horse's shoes. Their western trip continued with a hitchhiking hippie who brought Billy and Captain America to his community. The hippie communities were a present day comparison to the Native American way of life. They lived and worked off the land, relying on food and passing the peace pipe. They even lived in abandoned native homes. The freedom experienced in this part of the film would never again be recaptured. It was visually represented by shots of the landscape.When they left the community, they entered a more rural, small town area where they were instantly imprisoned. In prison, they met one of the most interesting characters of the whole movie, the alcoholic Jack Nicholson. When he decided to tag along for the ride to New Orleans, he was in a suite and tie (a visual statement of a man escaping from his urbanized way of life). He bribed the police and told the two main characters that he could get them out if they haven't killed anyone that was white. This statement, alone, shows the prejudice of small town America in the 60's, a time supposedly of civil rights. One of Jack Nicholson's last statements was the epitome of the movie. He said that the people were afraid of the two bikers because of their freedom. Freedom can be seen as dangerous. After their attack in the woods, they move on to a bordello and experiment with LSD in a cemetery. The visuals of the cemetery scene took up a great amount of time and seemed to make the movie into a piece of art. Taking styles from French New Wave Cinema, the camera shot the scene in a grainy film representing the hazy confusion of drug usage. It was like a montage, in a way, but only it was out of chronological order and was mixed with religious prayers and symbols. It truly gave the effect of an LSD trip to the audience, showing the pain, ecstasy, and confusion of drugs. The movie ends shortly after in an unexpected bloody manner. The two bikers were shot down on the side of the road by hicks who probably represented Nicholson's earlier remark. They were afraid of them for their freedom, jealous of their way of life. They were scared of what a free way of life could mean for their community. This freedom, oddly enough, was mainly symbolized by their long hair. In the end, what can we take from this film? It was a piece of art that moved from the freedom of the open west, to the captivity of the southeast. As civilization moved out of the 60's, the hippie population became scarce and was looked down upon like black people of the day. America was growing older. The hippies began to have families of their own, and the 60's came to a close. The fear of politics and war thrust the youth of the nation into an urbanized mold. The man is seen as victorious in this film, imprisoning and eventually killing our two main protagonists because of their freedom. This is the same freedom that this nation was said to have been built upon. One could look at this film and realize that we really are not free at all. We follow the crowd instead of following the road. The money in the gas tank was destroyed, in the end, along with the lives of Billy and Captain America. This movie taught us, however, to eventually forget about the money and enjoy the freedom of America as it should be experienced.

Basically Wyatt (Peter Fonda, also writing) and Billy (Dennis Hopper, also writing and directing) are two hippie bikers loaded with plenty of crack cocaine (which they sell) and weed/grass. They are riding their motorcycles for both fun, and to hopefully get to the Mardi Gras (a Christian lent inspired festival with free love) in New Orleans. They are not able to get anywhere to sleep as the people they go up to are afraid of their difference, and the only company they really get is allowing a hitch-hiker (Luke Askew) to join them. They do however find other hippies to live out their fake dreams and have some fun with, but there is a point where they encounter the wrong people and get put in a jail cell. In the cell is also alcoholic lawyer George Hanson (Oscar, BAFTA and Golden Globe nominated Jack Nicholson) who gets them out and hitches a ride with them. George is very keen to reach what he hears is the best brothel, or whorehouse towards New Orleans, George is also introduced to marijuana, and is tagged with the boys' discrimination. In the middle of the night, George is killed as some hillbillies seen in a restaurant they ate in attack them, but Billy and Wyatt carry on towards New Orleans. They reach the whorehouse, meeting prostitutes Karen (Karen Black) and Mary (Toni Basil), and the reach the Mardi Gras parade and celebration, and also have a bad trip in a graveyard. The final scene of the film sees Billy and Wyatt riding on their bikes heading for Florida, and two hillbillies spot them in their pickup truck, and it is only when Billy gives them the middle finger they decide to kill them with their shotgun, and one of the bikes goes up in smoke. Hopper does very well acting and directing, Nicholson is fantastic in his boozy role that propelled him to stardom, and Fonda is okay too. With some great location filming going through mountains and desert, bike riding, very well done moments of editing, especially the bad trip scene and a good soundtrack, this is a really worthwhile classic cult movie. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Writing, Story and Screenplay Based on Material Not Previously Published or Produced.

I thought that scene was disjoint from all the other parts of the movie that just meandered over trivial topics. The last scene's message was that the society wasn't quite ready for the kind of freedom these bikers were looking for ( or maybe that Capt.

Just as the commune and cemetery and campfire scenes are clearly drug-induced, so is the paranoia; the horror-movie style of the café scene and the killings owe more to drugs than to the era.Oh, yeah, drugs were around. Same today, not much difference. Yeah, prejudice was around, but outside of racial prejudice it rarely came to violence -- sometimes, but rarely. Yeah, there was some examination of ways of life, perhaps a bit more in that generation but hardly unique to it.Where have we heard about random highway murders, anyway? In LA = Los Angeles, not in LA = Louisiana.To me, reducing the three-hour version may have cut the wrong parts. The road trip is so disjointed that it doesn't make nearly the sense it could, but the murders make no sense outside of a drug-induced paranoiac state. If there was more road trip footage, I'd have liked to have seen it.I still give it 7/10 for the music, scenery, cinematography, and a few scenes -- the 360 pan at the commune evokes Andrey Rublyev. As for the rest, it's and this is your brain on drugs -- perhaps quite interesting, but should not be interpreted as anything more.And I'll second the recommendation of another reviewer that anyone who thinks Peter Fonda is wooden should watch Ulee's Gold.

He also unobtrusively makes the point that some of the seekers are as lost as the local yokels.Perhaps the telling difference is that the seekers knew that they were lost and eschewed violence, while the locals felt entitled to ridicule and destroy the stranger in their midst. Because Mr. Hopper does not dogmatize, we are free to draw our own conclusions. Without making excuses for the bikers (who are, after all, drug runners), we can see that the real crime is viewing the other as non-human, and therefore not worthy of being treated as human.

Don't trust anyone over 30, remember? The story centers around the two as they motorcycle from LA to New Orleans in search of America and their experiences along the way, some not so pleasant. And of course, Jack Nicholson in somewhat of a breakout role for him, is great as the sot lawyer they pick up along the way. Interesting musical score with various artists of the period. I would recommend this film to today's teens and twenty somethings as it might offer a taste of their parents' America circa Woodstock and the hippie era.

Sadly, it remained bad from start to finish...Let's look at the plot for a minute; 2 hippies pull up at a petrol station, do some coke and move on, they then pick up a hitchhiker and stop at some random place and have some food and then move on again.Later in the film our 2 hippies pick up lawyer George Hanson (Jack Nicholson) who decides to tag along on their road trip to get to the Mardi Gras. At this point the boredom and pointlessness of the film had almost wore me out, but I persevered hoping that it would improve as it went along, but sadly it never did.The general narrative showed Hopper and Fonda in a drug-induced stupor and after watching this film I couldn't help but wonder if they were in the same state when they produced this mess. To me this just felt like a private joke between Fonda and Hopper that just didn't transfer well to audiences. The film seemed to veer from one pointless scene to another without offering any humour, insight or good dialogue. Most of the film was painful and boring to sit through and I struggled making it to the end (even though it was only 90 minutes long). What makes it worse is what follows later in the film; Nicholson's character gets beaten to death and although attempts are made later to 'make' something of it, it still strangely felt rather unceremonious. The scenes after this are just plain bizarre and Fonda's glib comment at the end explaining the pointlessness of everything that they had endured might have worked better if the whole film hadn't have felt so pointless - for me there was an unintended irony here.Despite reasonable performances from Hopper, Fonda, and Nicholson this to me felt like a really bad private joke between Fond and Hopper and the whole film was just an embarrassment from start to finish. The bizarre narrative, lack of insight into any of the characters and mind-numbingly boring story made this a rather challenging 90 minute viewing experience. It's cult status and its grandiose status amongst critics and IMDb members alike is something that is as much of a mystery to me as the film itself.

It's definitely a movie that's more of an experience, rather than a traditional story. It's basically a road trip movie, but it doesn't have the traditional three-act structure. It was very anti establishment, and must have been very shocking for the time. Making the main characters hippie bikers, showing nudity, and having people tripping out in a cemetery is pretty hard-core, but that's what makes this movie so great. It's one of those movies that needed to be made, and it brings up a lot of thought provoking things about freedom, the American Dream, and society. It's a movie that's fun to watch, but at the same time also very hard to watch. What keeps you watching are the characters. Peter Fonda, Dennis Hopper, and a very young Jack Nicholson are all amazing, and after a while, you feel like you're on the road with them. The film doesn't glorify the biker lifestyle, but it doesn't portray them as horrible people. The film isn't saying that this is how you should be; it's saying you should be whoever you want to be. One of my favorite quotes from the movie is, 'All we represent to them, man, is somebody who needs a hair cut'. 'What you represent to them is freedom'. And the ending is another one of those endings that's very unsettling, but it makes the message of the movie so much stronger, and leaves a bigger impact on the audience. Easy Rider is a great movie, and definitely one of the most necessary movies of all time. It's so different from any other movie that came out at the time, and just watching it makes you feel rebellious. I don't think it's a movie for everyone, but I think most people can get behind what this movie is saying.

I had no idea what people saw in it. However, in the meantime, I have watched 457293811 films (give or take) and have changed a lot--as we all do over time. When I watched it again yesterday, I found so much to this film that I simply couldn't see the first time. Now I am NOT going to say that Dennis Hopper and Peter Fonda (who made and starred in the film) were geniuses here but they managed, with some amazing luck, to hit on something with this movie. In other words, their use of drugs managed to help them create the right movie for the right time. However, Hopper's next chance at directing (The Last Movie) was a complete mess--and listed as one of the films in the excellent book The 50 Worst Movies of All Time by Harry Medved)--because the drugs simply made his work incomprehensible.The film begins with two friends (Hopper and Fonda) making a big score--selling some cocaine to a crazy rich guy (very appropriately played by Phil Spector). Now with a fortune, they plan on taking their motorcycles across the American Southwest to New Orleans to party it up at the Mardi Gras.The film has little in the way of a strong plot--more just snapshots of their adventures along the way. Some of the vignettes seem to extol the virtues to the selfless and idealistic hippie movement (such as the group headed by Robert Walker, Jr.), some the importance of letting go and enjoying life (their bizarre meeting with Jack Nicholson) and many show the anger and hatred the 'squares' had towards these free spirits. However, what made this movie for me is that although it SEEMED to have a shallow plot and was often rather unprofessional looking, there was an amazing depth to the film that would make it excellent for repeated viewing. While the film would SEEM to make it look like it was idealizing drug dealing, it did not--as Fonda's character eventually realizes that all this money didn't give them the peace and happiness that some others had. It also was a great indictment of the state of America at the time--especially in the old South. All in all, well worth seeing.By the way, I grew up in a very conservative home during this time period. My father would often drive us into Georgetown (in DC) so we could watch the hippies and laugh at them....seriously. We would never yell at them or anything--just snicker at their clothes, hair and lifestyle. One time, however, our car broke down and these 'filthy hippies' all came and helped fix our car! It was, incidentally, the LAST time we ever went out to laugh at the hippies! Perhaps this, too, is why I found Easy Rider to be so interesting.

In today's perspective, it might come across as a bit of a weird and pointless movie, that doesn't even necessarily follow a script. But you have to put this movie in perspective and really look at it as a product and reflection of its time.Back in 1969, this was an incredibly relevant movie. An entire generation of course grew up during this period, in which people were in constant search of themselves, true freedom and happiness. They wanted to break free from the system and live life to the max, by their own rules and morals. Yes, drugs were also a big part of this philosophy, as this movie also very clearly shows.Life was taken as a true journey, which is exactly what the two main characters out of this movie are doing. They are traveling from Los Angeles to New Orleans, in search. In search of what? Well, I don't necessarily believe they knew that themselves but in order to go in search of something, you don't always have to set a main goal. Sometimes you just don't know what you are searching- and in need for and just have to take things as they happen and look at everything with a free and open mind. I think this movie reflects all of those themes perfectly.And like I said before, the movie doesn't really follow a clear main plot line, just like life basically. Some people might have problems with this while watching but I in this particular case liked the approach, since it suited the movie its themes and atmosphere.And all of the drug use in this movie was obviously all too real, since otherwise there could have been no way that a movie like this could had been made, the way it is, in my opinion. It can get a pretty trippy movie at times, in which the main actors are obvious just improvising away. But again, also this truly adds to the movie its themes and overall atmosphere.It of course also was the movie that launched the careers of many involved, mainly of course Peter Fonda, Dennis Hopper and Jack Nicholson. And all do a great job with their roles, no matter how crazy and stoned they got at times, which probably is the secret though as to why their performances work out so well within this movie.A great minimalistic and on its surface also simplistic movie, that is being a great reflection of its time and of an entire generation.8/10 http//bobafett1138.blogspot.com/ "}{"Title":"movie with no plot","Date":"30 April 2012","Score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Adventure, Drama","Review":" this movie was awful, a movie with no plot, bad acting, and bad editing. it never showed any progress through out the film. they buy drugs in Mexico, then go on a trip to New Orleans which really does not make sense at all, and finally get shot by two hicks on a country road. another thing they do in this movie is demote womens role in society.

I had a lot of hope for this film, but as it dragged forward, I began to lose interest and eventually loathe it.The low budget quality of the film was a big distraction. The characters were not very engaging, and I felt no connection to them. I will also acknowledge that I think this film might have had more of an impact on me if I were alive during that time. I found the trip scene to be agitating and pointless, which is another pointless 70's movie cliché (Midnight Cowboy). And without spoiling the ending, what the hell happened? It was an absurd ending to a pointless movie. I started to wonder if I was watching the characters slowly get depressed because things didn't work out, or if I was watching the actors slowly realize that their dream project blew.There are two redeemable aspects to the film 1) Jack Nicholson was the only interesting and engaging actor. I'm not partial to Nicholson (I like both Peter Fonda and Dennis Hopper), but Nicholson brought the slow, dragging movie to life.2)I did like the interesting take on bikers. They were always friendly, giving and oddly cheerful.I do not recommend this film to anyone except to the following people 1)People with access to a time machine that can only go back to the 70's.2)Anyone that wants to watch a movie high on acid.Overall, this film beats you over the head with symbolism and deeper meanings but I feel the film misses the target on everything it attacks religion, Midwest mentality, people with jobs, authority, people who like good movies, etc...

Even halfway through, I was a little confused. The first half is mostly Peter Fonda and Dennis Hopper riding their motorcycles with some nice scenery in the background and some classic rock blasting. Very little plot, besides a brief glimpse at a hippie commune and a family farm.The second half... well, that's a whole other story I won't give it away, but let's say it involves Jack Nicholson, some drug use and a few prostitutes (cult actress Karen Black and Mickey singer Toni Basil). Let your mind think up situations and I assure you what really happens is even more bizarre.The film is all Peter Fonda and Dennis Hopper they star, wrote and directed this film. I am not very familiar with Peter Fonda (though I love his daughter Bridget, who makes a small cameo in this film). He was excellent in this one. Dennis Hopper I know from such films as Blue Velvet he plays the cracked-out violent man very well. (If the rumors are true, he was cracked-out and violent on the set and treated the staff poorly, which does not surprise me in the least.) Hopper's violence was a bit disturbing at times, as I don't think it was the character's role to be so edgy. But I could be wrong.This is one of Jack Nicholson's earlier roles (allegedly his breakthrough role). And one of his funnier ones, as a drunkard and ACLU attorney. From his first moment on screen in the city jail, to the Jim Beam twitches... he really makes this film a joy to watch.Karen Black (who I know best from House of 1000 Corpses) and Toni Basil (again, the singer of Mickey in the 1980s) were great prostitutes. Their parts made the film go from strange to completely surreal. You might have to watch their scene two or three times before you fully understand what is happening. I should also mention even Phil Spector makes an appearance in this movie, which is excellent given how looking back now he was very much a man of the time (see also Roger Ebert's Beyond the Valley of the Dolls).The directing (by Hopper) is adequate, though the scene changes got a bit annoying with his flash technique. Credit should be given to the soundtrack people (perhaps Hopper again, I'm not sure), they picked out the perfect road music... unfortunately the sound editor doesn't know how to fade in and out, so songs get chopped in really bad places for no reason.A special mention should be made of cinematographer László Kovács. According to his obituary in Time magazine, Kovacs is the man who really made this film a notable piece with his vivid scenery. I was not aware when I watched the film that this was one of the first attempts to move from an indoor stage movie to an outdoors film. I now understand the importance of all the background shots (which were beautiful, to say the least).If nothing else, watch this film because it's a classic or because it's one of the few films about hippies actually filmed in 1968. You might get discouraged after the first half hour, but I assure you the second half is worth the wait. And if you don't appreciate older films in general, well, this is not for you. But I think you're missing a whole world of film.My only regret? I wish I would have watched Starsky and Hutch after this rather than before... would have appreciated it better.

An almost unbearably youthful Dennis Hopper and Peter Fonda, (young, but past their teenage years; just the right age for their spaced-out odyssey), are the hippie bikers who use their drugs money to take a trip, (literally and metaphorically), from LA to New Orleans where Mardi Gras is taking place. (Mardi Gras, itself, becomes more than an event; it becomes a state of mind). Of course, what they are really doing is looking for the heart of America and never finding it. Maybe it doesn't exist, at least in any form other than a heart of darkness.On route they meet a boozed-up young lawyer, beautifully, quintessentially played by a young Jack Nicholson, (who only took over the part when Rip Torn bowed out), and the role made Nicholson a star. It's a small part but it has all the blissful, inconsequential easy charm Nicholson was to bring to his later roles, (sometimes he brought too much inconsequential, easy charm; as an actor he disarms too easily). But by the time he was making Easy Rider he had yet to make an impression on us, and he blew us away.

This is true. This film, along with the frightening events at Altamont at the end of 1969, signalled the chequered flag, literally and figuratively, for the hippie movement and the freedom of expression of the 1960s.1971's 'Vanishing Point' tries to bask in the reflected glory of Easy Rider, yet appears overblown and pretentious in comparison. The photography, location and direction of the film are a perfect foil for our three heroes - Hopper and Fonda already open-minded, Nicholson is the drunk, middle-American who dares to push the (state) boundary and try to understand his new friends' quest.The irony of Nicholson's death in the film can't be overlooked. Fonda and Hopper are bruised but relatively unscathed. The yokels are punishing the 'real' American for daring to join these free-spirited 'non' Americans - he is one of their own turned bad. It's all very well to look at animals in a cage but it's unacceptable to jump in there and join them. These hillbillies were symptomatic of a reactionary, rural Deep South that was chalk to the big cities cheese.America is and always has been a country of contrasts and conflicting opinions.

Hopper had played many edgy roles on film and television so it wasn't a big stretch for him as the hippy drug dealing biker but Fonda had been known for a lot a squeaky clean roles and he really pulls off a great Captain America here as a drug dealing hippy biker.

Also in the cast look for Karen black, Phil Spector and as extras, Dan Haggerty, Carrie Snodgress and Bridget Fonda. Fonda and Hopper wrote the screenplay along with Terry Southern. Southern had been best known for his screenplay for Stanley Kubricks Dr. Strangelove and had also did the Screenplay for Barbarella staring Fonda's sister Jane. Easy Rider was made between two filmed adaptations of Southern's novels Candy and The Magic Christian and just after Barbarella. Easy Rider is a road picture with very little plot but was everything that a big Hollywood feature of the time wasn't and was important to independent films getting distribution. I think everyone expected this to be a drive-in movie and then disappear but it turned out to have legs (or wheels) and is loaded with great music of it's generation.

Free-wheeling, adventurous and marauding, these gangs tore up pavement of Southern California (for the most part). The Hells Angels Motorcycle Club was founded in San Bernardino, CA in 1948, but it was not until 1965 that the club erupted into the national spotlight following the allege rape of two young women in Monterey. And with the growing demographic of delinquent youths as movie go-ers, the studios started to cater to their lust for action and lawless-ness. An event in 1947 set the plot for the Marlon Brando film The Wild One (1953, László Benedek) but the movie eventually faded from the lime light. As the '60s got going, the Angels, and other gangs such as The Diablos and The Bandidos and The Gypsy Jokers, started to rev their engines and start to go out into public more often in formation. With their colors flying and their numbers in full swing, the gangs (or clubs) would sweep into a town for a weekend of debauchery and good ol' fashioned fun. The public started to take notice. Hunter S. Thompson, noted Gonzo journalist, went on the road for one year with the Hells Angels and released the book recounting their story, Hell's Angels The strange and terrible saga of the outlaw motorcycle gangs in 1966. '66 also saw the release of The Wild Angels (Roger Corman). California Senators hurriedly put together investigations into these motorcycle clubs (MC) and the findings were published and quoted in newspapers, Newsweek, and even ever skeptical Time. It was clear that the motorcycle gangs were going to be the media sensation of the late 1960s.With the studios paying closer attention to the fragmenting demographics of movie go-ers, films started to cater to this lust for action. And Peter Fonda was right on top of things when it came to making MC films. He starred in The Wild Angels as Heavenly Blues and according to J Hoberman, Fonda cooked up the idea for Easy Rider while smoking dope in his hotel room at 3 am. It dawned on Fonda, allegedly, that the modern cowboy was the motorcycle outlaw. (There is another story explaining the origin of Easy Rider which actually includes a Hells Angel as told by Peter Coyote in his memoir.) (J. Hoberman. The Dream Life. p.191) With the idea revving and some accidental funding, Fonda and a very paranoid Dennis Hopper embarked on relaying the life of the motorcycle outlaw to the drooling public.Although the film was a low-budget exploitation of the lust for MC debauchery in the theatres, it succeeded in capturing some of the essence of the time period. The desire to find a lost freedom in the vast expanses of paved California and across the States was real. The communes and reliance on rice as a food source, hospitality as a way of surviving day to day, and the necessity of drugs were all well known to the youths watching the film premier in '69. Some people, now in their 50s, glance back and the film with a sentimental eye, but realize how cliché some of the devices and characters were. All in all the film was a huge success because it played off a national hype surrounding the outlaw MCs of the period and represented the very real struggle to find America despite America.

But it wasn't that big of a decade for films. Easy Rider was trashed at the time and considered a trailer trash type of film. This day, it's considered an art form and a classic to many. When I finally watched the whole movie, I couldn't really pay attention. The whole thing to me felt like an acid trip. I know it was the 60's, but man, this was out there.I'm not really sure if this is a classic to be remembered. All I know is that his movie is about getting high, getting drunk, Jack Nicholson, and riding motorcycles. D So for the movie appreciators, this is for you.

Being a gen-xer I am often sick of listening to classic rock music and dealing with baby boomer culture. As I watched this movie I cringed a bit when I saw the old fashions. But this was all before I saw the commentary. According to the commentary easy riders was the first movie that really showed the counter culture as it was - not the stereotypical pollyanna ideal American youth that older generations wanted to portray. Now I really understand the cultural significance of this movie and I am glad I saw it. I also have noted how the characters did not have any idea about the consequences of drug use. Some of those same stereotypes are still the same today as they are 35 years ago. This film showed a commune, the hippie wandering spirit, the marijuana and the mentality of wanting to reconnect with the earth. You can still see this mentality today in seniors who were strongly influenced by this form of thinking and when you visit an area like Woodstock, New York or Parts of the San Francisco Bay area and Northern California. In addition, it was good to see where some of the songs I STILL hear on classic radio stations first came out. The scenery was just breathtaking. I really have to give them credit for capturing all they did. The only part I did not appreciate was near the end when they were all on what appeared to be lsd and the scenes all made no sense. I got the point early on and just wished that it had been significantly shortened. I would highly recommend this to people over 18. It is without a doubt one of the best films to capture the consciousness of an era that influences the present. "},{"Title":"Didn't like it then, don't like it now.

I couldn't identify with any of the characters, and I didn't use drugs so it seemed like the main characters were really bad guys. Now at middle age, I still don't care for it. So, why watch it again after 35 years ? Good question. I wanted to see Nicholson in his younger days and to see how much Hopper has changed over the years. Now that I live in the country, and rednecks are my neighbors, I find the movie a bit over the top with the violence. However, the year was 1969, there was an unpopular war on, unrest in the good old USA, and drugs were freely used (except by me). There was an unpopular President, and the country was quite divided. Just like it is now. I guess that's why I checked it out again. Nonetheless, it is still not my cup of tea, although I appreciate the type of film it is, and that it was meant to depict these guys as some kind of cool guys or something. But, they're still drug dealers, and that's why I couldn't connect or care about them, except George who appears to be an idealistic innocent bystander. The bad news is I suggested my 18 year old son check the movie out, and now that I've seen it again, I regret telling him that. Lastly, if you do like this movie, don't watch it on TV, they chop the heck out of it, and clean the language up. If you're gonna see it, see it as it was meant to be seen.

It is obvious they had to die, what would they have done with all that money in Florida? The whole movie's idea would loose its strength if these two wanderers ended living a normal kind of life amongst wealthy people. They would have been corrupted. It would have been like seeing Dean Moriarty sane, sober, with a pretty family and working in an office, living in a tiny house in suburbia. Awful.The easy answer is that they were going against society's laws and values, this biggest and more powerful monster had to eliminate them. But, no, that is not the answer. That simplistic answer limits the movie to a polarized vision of the world where liberty fights against repression, good against evil. What could be more typical?No. This movie goes beyond this eternal dialectic. No. What happens is that these two wanderers do not embody only liberty, they are not just rebels, they are not only the good guys. In fact, they won their money from drug dealing, what is somewhat reprehensible, morally speaking. But that is just another reason for their death.What happened is that they screwed up, as Fonda said during their last night. They did not understand the hippies, the people they looked like, physically, at least, and they felt relieved when they left this community of peace and love. They didn't even share with the hippies the acid as the guy who offered it to them made it understand, in a subtle way.But their main sin was to pervert Nicholson, to have initiated him into the world of drugs and of the road in order for him to only find death in the kicks of the repressive men of the South.They went to Mardi Gras to get in a whore house. After a while, they got out and the entered the graveyard where the ate the acid which made them cry as the prostitute yelled I'm dying, I'm dying. Maybe another death they caused, symbolically.They where just two guys, absolutely unable to adapt themselves into anything, who left behind them nothing but death. It seems as they did not mean to, but that is even worse. That is why society killed them. Well, yes, there may be a little of the liberty repression thing but I prefer my way to interpret it.

It's a great low budget/high caliber view of America and the end of one of its most notorious eras.  It's filled with great concepts and symbolisms, from filling the American flag with money to throwing time away.  There's a western theme going on at the same time as well.  The main characters are named Billy (Billy the Kid) and Wyatt (Wyatt Earp).  They are the new cowboys, horses replaced by motorcycles.  There's a great scene where two men are changing a horse's shoes that's backdropped by our heroes changing their tire.  Another favorite scene is the one featuring the Porky Pig dialogue.  That's all totally improvised and their interaction is perfect.  Every character and actor is fantastic.  Dennis Hopper, Peter Fonda, Luke Askew, Karen Black, and Toni Basil all play integral parts in making this film unforgettable.  Let's not forget Jack Nicholson. You mean Marijuana?  He's great.  Easy Rider also easily has one of the best incorporations of songs from that decade, including Hendrix, Steppenwolf, The Band, especially The Band, and The Birds.  The film relies on these songs to tell a part of the story.  As for the ending, absolutely depressing.  Peter Fonda has one thing to say  We blew it.  That line is so cryptic and I know that's the way they wanted it.  My take on that is that Fonda doesn't desire retirement or any part of the American dream and should have stayed in the commune where freedom truly reigns.  But instead he travels down the wrong path with Billy that leads to their deaths.  They blew it.  It's a real bummer, but it's necessary.  Dennis Hopper and Peter Fonda have created a work of genius.

It's no masterpiece, and other films of the American golden age are better in one respect or another. But few are quite as sad, and stick with one quite as indelibly, as Easy Rider. Keep in mind that the filmmakers were NOT hippies - they all came of age during the '50s, products of the Beat Generation and the James Dean era. Ducktails, not freaks. And in general, among '60s pop culture figures, the younger ones tended to be more goofily optimistic and pie-eyed; the slightly older ones, like Hopper, Fonda, and Terry Southern, seemed to have an in-grown pessimistic sense that all these good times and feelings of liberation couldn't last. They were right, so far as it goes.Easy Rider is about a couple of hipsters (I mean this more in the Lenny Bruce sense than the flower power sense) who set out looking for some kind of experience that's better than the cynical world they're used to. Not only do they not find it, but ultimately they find themselves ALONE. The visuals capture this perfectly, every step along the way. Everybody wants to be them. But you don't want to be them.Easy Rider is best considered alongside the other films that BBS Productions put out in the following few years, enabled by the money ER earned The Hired Hand, Five Easy Pieces, King of Marvin Gardens, Stay Hungry, Drive He Said, others. What they have in common is an image of a country - a society - in a chronic state of drift, where individuals live more and more in a vacuum and where connecting with someone else becomes less possible all the time. A cinema of all-American alienation, heavily influenced by the French New Wave but hypnotized by the poetry of the American landscape. Not a bad achievement in just six or seven years for a group of filmmakers who've spent most of the rest of their careers making crap.

Peter Fonda is a great pioneering hippy as he and his buddy Billy (played by Dennis Hopper, who is much like a younger version of his character Hughey Walker in 'Flashback') travel the U.S. in search of America and themselves. This movie is great at making its main character (Peter Fonda) a person of much depth, yet very mysterious at the same time.I thought that Dennis Hopper's character Billy could have been developed a little better. I think that his character was revealing too many flaws for such a dense character (he seemed too shallow, and was almost like Fonda's side kick, and I think it would have been good if they were both objects of study, rather than Fonda). This was my only problem with this movie,I still liked the character, I just wish he could have been deeper, but I suppose that Captain America (Fonda) was really the movies focus.My favorite character was George Hanson.

It's the inexpensive, unpolished tale of a pair of bikers drifting through a hostile American landscape in search of freedom. As the protagonists drift, so does the plot, as we are shown their mostly unrelated (yet incredibly important) experiences to the accompaniment of a fabulous psychedelic rock soundtrack. Spirit and vitality bursts from every richly-colored frame. We are shown beautiful images that are soon contrasted with the hideously closed-minded ugliness that abounds. The jarring, violent, uncompromising finale almost brought me to tears. It's cruel and unfair; it makes you want to scream out, Why does it have to be like this? And that's the point exactly. And it leaves you with the faint notion that perhaps, now, our heroes have finally discovered the freedom they were searching for.Absolutely perfect in every department, from Laszlo Kovacs's gorgeous cinematography to the superb performances of Peter Fonda, Dennis Hopper, and Jack Nicholson. Even the minor performers are great, with top honors taken by Toni Basil and the ever-wonderful Karen Black as hookers who join the protagonists on a very disturbing acid trip. Honest, thought-provoking, and ultimately deeply unsettling, Easy Rider is an all-time classic that you'll never forget.Important note Lately many people look at this film and whine, Oooooh, it's daaaaated!

In random order, these include the search for meaning in life, sense of freedom, the importance of an alternative lifestyle (shown in both the hippie/commune and biker culture), the difficulty of coping with a changing order, intolerance of difference and bigotry, and the role of recreational drug use.The situations and characters show a wonderful naivety - what you see is what you get from everyone.  Nobody plays games or tries to hide their true feelings.  Sometimes what we get is deep and fine (eg the farmer's family), other times it's deep and terrible (southern rednecks), or other times again it doesn't amount to much (eg commune drama), but is still totally honest. What is really great about this movie is that it encourages the viewer to acknowledge their own feelings about the themes in an equally direct and honest way, but also to realise that none of these aspects are totally clear cut.The movie won't please everyone, because the demands of the film for honesty are too much for some.  Though many will like the wonderful entertainment, especially the cinematography and soundtrack.  (How did we ever get away from such fine music 30 years ago to what we have today?)For me, the most evocative aspect is the long road scenes.  These need to be long because they actually give a personal sensation of freedom in the way only American roads can.  Often you feel you personally are on a third (unseen) bike travelling in a group with the other two.  Not that many road movies manage this.Jack Nicholson of course was the stand-out actor and Dennis Hopper was very good, but I feel that Peter Fonda's performance was also first rate.  He gave a dispassionate distance to all that was happening which somehow encourages you to observe but not judge.Unforgettable images and has the possibility to change your life perspective.

Well, probably the most shocking thing in the movie nowadays is Toni Basil as a lithe prostitute, baring her breasts. The one-hit wonder (but what a hit) with &#147;Mickey&#148; in 1981, seeing her exposed derriere means when she innocently dresses up as a cheerleader I can never look at her in quite the same way again.Then there&#146;s Jack Nicholson, making an impact as a drunken lawyer with a stereotyped southern twang. Paid less than the union rate at just $2000, five years after this film was made he was earning a million dollars a movie, and the year after that his first Oscar. While only having a brief role, Nicholson acts as a perfect counterpoint to Hopper and Fonda&#146;s characters. And what of Fonda and Hopper themselves? Well, the much-vaunted feud still continues, it seems. After famous spats during filming (one alleged incident involved Fonda threatening to defend himself against any attack by Hopper by hitting him in the face with a motorcycle chain &#150; &#147;you&#146;ll find that&#146;s a motherf****r&#148; he reportedly said), the two have still not made up. A recent 30th Anniversary Convention saw them on stage together for the first time, where Hopper accepted an apology because &#147;it&#146;s kudos to accept&#148;, though stated that he normally wouldn&#146;t talk to someone who had described him as a &#147;f*****g Nazi&#148;.Of course, the real plaudits go to this film for being produced on less than $400,000 and grossing more than $50 million.

But taken on it&#146;s own terms &#150; that is, it being a single movie &#150; is it actually any good? Well, performances and direction cannot be faulted. But ultimately the film is a meandering one, covering the story of two bikers travelling to Mardi Gras in New Orleans to a backdrop of mundane country and western music. A song that has as a chorus &#147;don&#146;t Bogart that joint, my friend &#150; pass it over to me&#148; is the &#147;highlight&#148; in a stirring banality of incidentals, only punctuated by thankful bursts of Steppenwolf and Hendrix. In fact, the whole pace of the picture is laborious, reflecting its drug-laden theme. In terms of incident, nothing much happens until an hour and ten minutes into the movie, and then again only towards the admittedly stunning conclusion. What I can&#146;t really comprehend is the critical lauding of the movie&#146;s content, with some excitingly blathering about the &#147;blistering attacks on American conservatism&#148;. To be honest, apart from one or two small references, there really isn&#146;t any political thread to this picture. Slight references to statues of God do not religious symbolism make, yet there are countless websites thrown up in awe of this dialogue-light exploitation picture. It&#146;s nice enough to look at, and while you can respect its art, in a modern context it&#146;s pretty hard to take it all so seriously. Maybe I&#146;m just too young to really dig it, man. 7/10.

The leather jacket with the American flag and the distinctive choppers are still to come, as these guys are still buying, not selling. After they do sell their suspicious white powdery substance to a menacing- looking L. A. slimeball, the now-well-off bikers head off into the horizon in their famous gear as Steppenwolf incongruously performs the anti-drug anthem The Pusher.It's ten minutes before we hear either of the pair say a word in English, but it's sure worth the wait.You're pulling inside, Billy observes to his zombie-like pal. You're getting a little distance, baby.Yeah, I'm getting my thing together, answers Captain A.Scintillating, no? Well, if you think so, then you're in luck, because these guys talk like that for the whole movie, which could have been titled Ninety Minutes In Search Of A Plot.The movie gets a little better when Fonda wakes up and rejoins the movie. Hopper, however, is all over the place, acting like the character he later played in Apocalypse Now except he's not much fun. The dialogue, he tells us in a director's commentary, was often improvised by weed-smoking actors. It sure sounds that way.You can't argue that Easy Rider is an important movie. It has a great look-and-feel to it, courtesy of the rock score and László Kovács's psychedelic-but-disciplined lens work. The main problems are the characters' stubborn incoherence, the director's goofy French New Wave affectations, and the story's avoidance of anything resembling creative resolution. The guys just travel from place to place, socialize with people who are accepting and shake off those who aren't, until everything kind of just gets tossed on the roadside for us to work out.I like some bits in this movie, which can be divided into three parts of unequal length. The first, longest part, has the pair meet a stranger played by Luke Askew, the guy who made life so miserable for Cool Hand Luke two years before. Adjusting to that hard-jawed prison guard now dressed like a rainbow-trousered John Holmes is a trip, but Askew does a nice job, alternately confiding (to Captain America) and sharp (to the more hostile Billy).The people this place belongs to are buried beneath you, he tells Billy between drags of his doobie. You could be a trifle polite.In a great documentary that comes with the 30th Anniversary DVD and makes for much better viewing than the movie, Askew makes an interesting point about his character, that he's a bit of a leech that sets himself up as boss in a hippie commune in order to use the ladies. But none of this insight makes the finished film. The unnamed Askew character just stares out glassy-eyed for a while, warns the guys to be careful, and that's that.Later on, when the pair meet Jack Nicholson as alcoholic lawyer George Hanson, the film works harder at its core messaging. Like, freedom, man! And Venusians! Other than that, though, it doesn't have much to say, other than people who don't like hippies are a drag and dangerous besides. Nicholson is amusing, and it's fun seeing him settle into an early version of his wild-man persona, but it's still a long way to the Overlook Hotel, and the film loses him in a big scene that, like others in this movie, is not resolved but abandoned, for a final section set in Mardi Gras which includes a graveyard acid trip, glimpses of female nudity, and much mumbling.The whole film suffers from this slackness. As director, Hopper just wasn't into structure, and it shows. At least this viewer requires more. If you remember Easy Rider when it came out, you may have a soft spot for this film, but like Robin Williams might have put it, if you do remember Easy Rider when it came out you probably weren't really there.

Instead we received a film that was really drugged beyond boredom. It's just about two young druggies (Peter Fonda and Dennis Hopper) searching for the American dream, except doing it the wrong way. Along the way, they meet with up Jack Nicholson's character, a alcoholic lawyer who does not really know the meaning of freedom. He is sort of a guide to them, telling them about the dangers of being free. Everyone will fear them and will become dangerous. This observation is noticed when they enter a restaurant that they realize that they are not being served, but being discriminated by the rednecks in the place, resulting with Nicholson's death. Then it rambles on into a LSD scene, which is very graphic, confusing and lost my interest towards the end when both are killed.I will give credit to the cinematographer for his beautiful portrayal of the countryside and wired-out scenes of the LSD sexual rampage. The music is also fantastic and shows the decline of the hippies/LSD generation throughout the films. Unfortunately, the performances were not at par with the film. Only Jack Nicholson was good to watch. I am totally disgusted with the tone of this film. I guess I didn't really understand the theme of this film and I should have been in a different mood in order to view this film, but the search for paradise through this look is atrocious. I guess I can understand some of the meanings of what this film is trying to depict, but this is not a film that I would like to view again.3/10.

The hippies of the sixties started their conquest with the right ideas, then lost them somewhere along the way. Dennis Hopper, who directed, co-wrote and co starred along with Peter Fonda who produced, co-wrote and starred, managed to show the pros and cons of the hippie generation along with the quarrels of the different ideals that where happening in the United States at that time period.Author Andy (film-critic) from Flatlands of Illinois This film should be shown in every American History class in the United States. It not only showed the beauty of the country of which we reside, but it also spoke about the people that reside in it. http//www.imdb.com/title/tt0064276/usercomments This film links the far left liberal to the white collar conservative, the stoned to the sober, the poor to the rich, and the black to the white. It starts the viewer out with the idea of supporting the liberal views of 'free love' and 'stickin' it to the man' and then showing why these views don't work. It doesn't work because of human nature, the look out for #1 side anyway.As the ending stages of the film draw near, after the cross country journey and Mardis Gras, while sitting next to the campfire Wyatt proclaims to Billy, 'We blew it'. This is the pivotal line in the film that basically explains everything. They 'blew it' because they did exactly what they set out to prove was wrong. They went to find America, the America that is founded upon hard work and making your own way through life to the best of your ability through blood, sweat, and tears. But how did they make their money? The easy way, the way of the easy rider, by taking a free ride on the whore which is America. Buying a large quantity of cocaine, taking a little drive and selling it isn't exactly hard work.by chtfj21 (Sun Aug 20 2006 072704 ) Can anyone explain the ending please? How on earth do those serial killers fit into the story?  Some viewers may not comprehend the end of this masterpiece... Those viewers have missed the entire moral value of the story. The point of the story is not to glorify the hippies ideology but to prove that they have a completely misconstrued vision of freedom. The demise of Wyatt and Billy is the only way this film could have ended because it proved that people can turn violent if their ideals are tested too much.Do they call Fonda's character Wyatt just to pay some respect to Henry Fonda's role as Wyatt Earp, or does it go deeper? Really both characters stand for the same thing, just in a different way at a different time, freedom. Freedom is the main point of the statement that is Easy Rider but it is the perception of freedom that is really tested. Is freedom taking a free ride or earning what you receive, getting what you deserve and becoming only what you make for yourself, basically what Charlie Daniels sings about in Long Haired Country Boys.The difference between Easy Rider and films pre-1960s is that cinema takes a turn from just being for purely entertainment to actually showing what's happening in our culture. Film makers turn away from the werewolves and feather-haired, green tight clad heroes to something a little more far out; what was happening right before our eyes.Quintessential, 23 June 2003 Author richard winters (rwint) from Chicago, Illinois Lazlo Kovacs cinematography is outstanding. It captures the American landscape like its a travel show. The hippy commune scene is the best. You feel like you are right there. There is also the very memorable hallucinogenic drug scene in a graveyard.  http//www.imdb.com/title/tt0064276/ A lot of the camera work was rather experimental and different from things audiences are used to seeing. They use things that would normally be looked upon as faults like sun flares and out of focus shots but there is also quite a bit of traditional camera work done too. There are John Ford influences such as landscape overpowering the main focal points and the traditional long shot to mid shot to short shot sequences.There is also an obvious Kurosawa influence in the directing such as capturing footage of the characters through natural elements such as a campfire, smoke, and foliage. The ever present visual metaphors also give a bit of a Kurosawa vibe. Some may take a viewer a few viewings of the movie to even notice.

I have a very fractional take on the sixties, meaning I know what's in the history books. I know that the people of the generation of New American Cinema stood for a set a values, a collective psyche of Cultural Revolution, a mindset that's become foreign to our present day. When I look at Easy Rider in terms of a commentary of its time, I see a tremendously hopeful story of two friends up against the world, and enjoying every second. Yet you also see those two un-tamed youths brutally slain at the end of the film. They were just two harmless bikers; they smoked some grass, tripped on LSD, whose only goal in life was to have fun. Really, it's this youthful way of life that proved the most difficult to accept for the aging parents of the sixties cultural.Captain America and Billy, Peter Fonda and Dennis Hopper, begin the film by being couriers in a cocaine deal between shady Mexicans and an even shadier Phil Spector portrayed anonymous rich-guy. They decide to take the money from the deal and head for Mardi Gras. Along the way the viewer of the movie is treated to their story, from spending time at a religious convent to meeting a brash young lawyer named George Mason (Jack Nicholson) in a small town in Texas who decides to join them. All throughout the movie the heroes are unwelcome at hotels and restaurants because of their hippie-like appearance. They are subject to slurs and treatment not too unlike the treatment of African Americans in the south. The things they stood for were so reviled that they ultimately lose their lives.The visuals in this film are striking. The montage of Captain America and Billy beginning the journey through the deserts of either Arizona or New Mexico set to songs like Steppenwolf's Born to be Wild and The Band's The Weight set a tone of freedom and adventure not unlike the tone in any classic western. Our two leads though, are not moving west like a typical Western movie would have them. Instead they are riding their motorcycles east, in reverse if you will. They embody the same spirit found in the Wild West, yet they in turn are riding machines in reverse of the typical direction. This movie was made at the exact same moment in time that Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and Robert Kennedy were assassinated. There was a lame duck President leading the country in a quagmire of a War in Vietnam, and let's not to forget the ongoing Cold War with Russia. The very things our country had always valued, loaded terms like freedom and liberty, intrinsic building blocks of an empire, such as the ability to trust authority, all these things were under attack at this very instant in time. Out of this we see a movie where two innocent counter-culture members are gunned down in cold blood by a couple of true Dixie boys from the good ol' South. It's as direct commentary of it's time as much as any piece of entertainment has ever been. It's both highly entertaining and highly controversial. It's well acted, well directed, and shot beautifully. It has an almost unbelievably effective soundtrack. It's a brilliant film, I feel sorry it took me 22 years to finally see it.

With its rock music soundtrack, the Dennis Hopper directed film became anthemic, as much a touchstone for the culture of the times as The Beatles' Sgt. Pepper album and Woodstock.  Like those productions, Easy Rider became a source of identification for many who came of age in its shadow.  Time hasn't been overly kind to the Fab Four's pretentious 1967 album, and Woodstock now looks less like three days of love, peace, and music than it does the co-opting of rock and roll by capitalism.  For awhile, Easy Rider, with its Man! heavy dialogue, psychedelic party sequence, and wooden acting by Peter Fonda, looked like it would age even less well than a Peter Max poster.  When it made its TV debut in the Cleveland area in 1976, it was as rambling as a pothead's conversation, and so open-minded in its depiction of the protagonist's lifestyles as to be empty-headed.  Times had changed.  But in the more than 20 years since the film's TV sale, times have changed again and so has my evaluation of the film that made Jack Nicholson a star.  In a era in which youth shaves its heads, wears baseball caps despite no appreciation for the game, and listens to rap music, the counterculture heroes portrayed by Fonda and Hopper are more appealing than ever.  Ditto Hopper's direction and Laszlo Kovacs' fluid cinematography, both a refreshing change of pace from the rapid edits and monotonous style of today's MTV influenced movies. Fonda seems less wooden, even admirable in his Captain America guise, and Hopper, in his floppy hat, shades, and fringe jacket is an affable hippie freak, a reminder of what was good about the 60s.  Nicholson may have gotten an Oscar nomination for supporting actor, and the prize itself from the N.Y. Critics Circle, but he now seems overly mannered in comparison to his co-stars.  As for that score (I mean the music!), it remains more potent than 99% of today's music, and provides Easy Rider with an extra edge that, considering how sharp it is on its own, it barely needs.

This seminal saga cost roughly $360-thousand and reaped $41-million at the box office. Basically, Easy Rider is all about intolerance and the Generation Gap in America during the 1960s. A couple of hippies drug some cocaine to a wealthy gent and then set out for Mari Graus in New Orleans. Along the way, they pick up an alcoholic lawyer (Jack Nicholson) and rednecks assault them and beat the lawyer to death. Easy Rider is a forerunner of Deliverance. In Easy Rider, rednecks slaughter the angelic but stoned motorcyclists, while the rednecks rape the sportsmen in Deliverance. Since Hollywood could not depict back rape back in the 1960s, particularly man-on-man--sadistic homosexuality, the rednecks simply beat them up. Captain America (Peter Fonda) and Billy (Dennis Hopper) meet intolerance no matter where they go and die as a consequences. This is liberal, gonzo filmmaking at its zenith and it exerted considerable effect on Hollywood and the industry at large. The word is that Fonda and company smoked real marijuana on the set which reflects the indie nature of this venture. Columbia Pictures didn't understand this counter-cultural masterpiece but they embraced its millions. Easy Rider couldn't have come at an more opportune time in Hollywood and social history. The imagery of the film influenced the cultural landscape and it appeared at a time of deep social unrest in the post-Civil Rights era. So if the marginal plot&#x97;call it existentialism&#x97;does nothing for you, the portrait of America and the intolerance displayed toward the hippies stands as an accurate barometer of the times. Easy Rider couldn't have been made much earlier because the Production Code Administration had only recently been dismantled in favor of a rating classification system. Fonda and Hopper don't so much deliver believable performances as they inhabit their costumes. Jack Nicholson is simply brilliant as the doomed lawyer George Hanson who understands the moral conscience of the terrain. He summarizes this when he tells Billy, What you represent to them is freedom. The soundtrack features many tunes of the times that immortalize this picture.

Easy Rider is a masterpiece that clarified reason within many of our parents' generation. Liberation and understanding formed the basis of this opus that, to this day, serves as a historical landmark in the film industry. It is hard to find a movie that serves as a voice for a generation and this is what makes Easy Rider such a treasure.

As far as movies are concerned there aren't many films that I can say explain the sociological significance of Generation X, which only, to me, proves that Easy Rider is an ambitious 60′s generation landmark film statement.I will only translate a brief film synopsis so as not to belittle the enormous significance of this film. Easy Rideris a film about two hippies( Peter Fonda and Dennis Hopper) traveling cross-country on their Choppers with the intention of discovering the American Dream. Little do these two hippie bike riders realize that the American Dream is heavily tainted by the unfortunate realization that bigotry and ignorance are inescapable even within their own homeland.Keep an eye-out for a young Jack Nicholson who plays an amazing role as George Hanson, a free-wheeling, southern politicians' son who is immune to the small-town politics that serve as his safety blanket.Do not miss this epic film that is designed by a mind expanding soundtrack including Roger McGuinn and an eye-opening cinematography by Laszlo Kovacs and Baird Bryan.

The script is very effective and the content is strong and filled with many social issues of the 60's. Dennis Hopper's direction shows perfectly that he was as good a director as he was an actor. The acting is faultless, the three main actors Peter Fonda, Dennis Hopper and Jack Nicholson are superb and work wonderfully together. The film was put together in a way that some say is hard to follow but I found it easy to follow and greatly put together. I really enjoyed the way he cuts between scenes with the quick flashes back and fourth. I also liked the graveyard scene which was masterfully done in a new contemporary way with quick montages.

The jump cuts in between scenes, soon become boring and repetitive. It works in a strange way though. It is jolting and fits the disjointed feel of the rest of the movie. As far as filming goes, the acid trip in the latter half of the movie is possibly the most interesting and well done.

That's what happened with Easy Rider and me. Peter Fonda and Dennis Hopper set out to do a few things. One, they wanted to display the death of the American dream. Two, they wanted to create the ultimate road movie. Three, they wanted to combine a killer soundtrack with some excellent appreciation of motorcycles. I feel like they nailed all of these things, but it never worked for me at all on my personal level.I have admittedly always been the kind of film admirer whose attention gravitates more towards narrative and complex, fleshed-out characters. With no real narrative structure and two thin, undeveloped lead characters, this film wasn't made for me. It's more of a mood piece, wrapped within it's thematic journey, and I feel that it absolutely captured what it wanted to be. I admire it a lot for that, but I still can't bring myself to say that I liked the film because it simply didn't appeal to my own personal taste.I loved the contrast between Hopper and Fonda's characters, the former still trying to live the dream while the latter is more morose, almost as if he's accepting his fate and trying to take in the beauty before the dream is dead. However, I feel that both actors drop the ball at points, with Hopper putting in too much and Fonda straining too hard to appear cool. Jack Nicholson comes into the picture like a born star, and he really runs away with the entire film.This is one of those rare performances that immediately draws your attention and whenever he is on screen, everything is pulled towards him. I couldn't take my eyes off of him, which is a tip of the hat to his skill as an actor, but as a supporting character it's more of a detriment to the film overall because my interest decreased drastically once Hopper and Fonda continued their adventure without him. Nicholson steals it, but there's still a lot to admire here from the main team behind it. I think they got it all right, but it just wasn't for me.

This impressive film has a couple bikers (Dennis Hopper, Peter Fonda) heading across country for Mardi Gras where they see both the good and bad that the land has to offer. I've heard several people refer to this as a flawed masterpiece, which I think is fair. This is certainly far from a perfect film as there are plenty of things wrong with it yet, at the same time, there's something so special about this movie that you can't help but be drawn in by the images on the screen. I think a lot of credit has to go to Hopper as there were countless biker films released before this one yet this one here doesn't try to be exploitation but instead it tries to say something about the times. I think it would be fair to say that the film deals with various stereotypes but in the end the message is certainly here. Even though this was Hopper and Fonda's child, there's no question that the real star here is Jack Nicholson, playing lawyer George Hanson, which would be his break through role. Nicholson is so perfect here that I don't think anyone would argue that his twenty-minutes or so on screen were the high point of the film. His high speech about UFO's is classic and that accent is priceless. There's no a single frame where Nicholson isn't glowing and jumping off the screen like very few performances that come to mind. Watching the film now you still can't help but be impressed by what he accomplishes in these few scenes. Both Hopper and Fonda are perfect as well. Hopper shows even at this early stage he could play someone off centered and Fonda plays what I've always seen as a hippie version of something his father would have played. Fonda's character here is the calm, peaceful and thoughtful one, which is the type of character his father played countless times and the only difference is that Peter had the long hair. The entire journey that is taken here doesn't take up too much plot but it does offer an interesting look at the decade and the land back then. The images of the South and West are one of the highlights here as is the wonderful soundtrack, which includes music by Steppenwolf, The Byrds, The Band, Bob Dylan, Jimi Hendrix and countless others. This film certainly has many flaws but at the same times there's no denying its importance as well as its place in time.

Essentially, it's a great soundtrack held together by attractive landscape imagery, some rambling conversational set-pieces and a wildly melodramatic ending, but it chimed with the spirit of its turbulent times to a remarkable extent.

It's the classic indie movie, made on a rather modest budget and has since grown into a well deserved classic status.The movie is basically about two bikers whose journey through the American heartland is used to express a lot of things the makers wanted to say about the society.A couple of things Jack Nicholson's character says really strike you powerfully- the way the leadership of the world can be changed by aliens who are much better than us human beings who are waging wars over the measliest of matters and another about how the concept of absolute freedom can be terrifying. The way the so called cultures society shuns the three 'rough dudes'. Dude- Nicholson's character doesn't know the meaning of the word paving way for one of the lighter moments of the movie. When you come to think of the high brow society, you would realise that there could not have been any other climax for the movie. My favourite sequence is the collective drugged hallucinations. You could even imagine the two truckers going home to play with their young sons and daughters and saying grace before dinner satisfied of a very good deed done!Another great aspect of the movie is the soundtrack. It fits the timeline of the movie perfectly. It blends into the movie perfectly and accentuates the overall feel that it wants to accomplish.

Rather than make a brash statement on anything global or political, Easy Rider narrows things down and quietly observes what's going on within a nation and how a generation are acting and reacting to what's expected of them. The film is easy to relate to in both a generational and approach-like sense; that is to say, two people; on motorcycles; cruising the country and essentially discovering as much about themselves as they are the nation and the should-be manner in which to exist in this time and place.The film opens with its two chief protagonists named Wyatt (Fonda) and Billy (Hopper) meeting up with some shady men under the flight path of some low flying aircrafts. We eventually discover that they have just sold some drugs and, with the money earned from this, they are to travel across America to New Orleans. The opening feels like some sort of sordid silent movie, with distorted and deafening aircraft noises acting as harsh sound effects for a relatively simple scene while a series of expressions and reactions are revealed that get across the bulk of how these people feel and react to the situation. It feels cramped, loud and quite disorientating, particularly given it is the very opening of the film. Hopper then offers us some relief; a cut to a true opening shot of the deserts of somewhere as two bikes head down a road. Hopper juxtaposes shot choice and atmosphere brilliantly; it feels more upbeat as the new situation is they've inherited all this money, no longer have monkeys on their backs and are off on a road trip together. But this 'proper' opening is again turned on its head when we realise later on just what has transpired. It is a false and purposefully pleasant opening to a journey that will be anything but.You might say that one of maybe a few sub-themes in Easy Rider is dreams. Wyatt talks a lot early on about the American Dream and how he is perhaps slightly envious of the people living the typical American Dream, in the sense they might own a farm; be their own bosses and live off the land. Hopper's attention mise-en-scene is equally impressive. His alluding as to where the money earned by way of selling these drugs is situated for the duration of the trip is interesting, as are the clothes his two leads wear. Bathed in the American flag, Wyatt wears the symbol of the very nation he is both exploring and wants to subscribe to in terms of its ideation. Additionally, it is Wyatt's chopper that houses the, some might say, ill gained money and it is a petrol tank covered in a print of the American flag that houses the very contents which is allowing these two to seek and fund their fortunes.Along the way, the film will seductively begin to apply greater ideas to the overall notion of both the American Dream, the pros and cons of that ideation and the rather interesting study of individualism. The delivery is pretty clear cut in the sense Wyatt and Billy's interactions with a rancher and his family during a large dinner gathering offer one side of the ideation working whereas a, more larger, group of people are not able to subscribe to one of Wyatt's earlier fantasies of growing one's own crops and living freely, as these people cut off from the dominant social groups and beliefs. One might argue that this 'group' of whom cannot quite achieve this are of a more spiritual and religious kind, but rather than act as an entirely frank demonisation of any particular sects, we must remember they additionally subscribe to casual drug use and 'free love' which, depending on how you want to look at the text, might act as a distinct study of how not to live even though your initial priorities of not going with the norm are in place.Another interesting element to the text is Jack Nicholson's character of George Hanson, a voice of reason and a man who we might assume to have already subscribed to some kind of American Dream plan when we realise he is a lawyer. Nicholson portrays Hanson as an observant but slightly eccentric individual, someone who isn't afraid to voice opinions. It's interesting for the film to spend so much time with the two leads we're given and then introduce Hanson, who is more intelligent and who is someone that formally identifies Billy as an archetype of individualism and freedom through his hair, clothing and actions. On this level, you might assume Hanson to represent a sort of voice for the picture; as a person that comes just as easy as he goes and re-enforces the ideas of individualism just as efficiently as he points them out. A sort of 'I have no idea who you are but I sort of know what beliefs you subscribe to, and that's fine with me' way of thinking.Some might argue that the film needs to unfold in the deep south to get across the opinion, which one of the characters themselves exclaim, when it appears the nation is falling apart in order to demonise that region of the country. Others might say it is representative of the whole nation as a collective group of people forever shunning those on the outskirts, in minorities, doing their own thing. What might easily have been a series of daft scenes and occurrences compiled together to form a meandering at times road trip actually turns out to be an interesting and quite powerful odyssey for the-then free spirit.

The visionary direction by Walter Salles is spectacular. Revolving around two men going on a journey before their lives begin, the film is a definitive movie in motorcycle history and being a huge fan, I knew Easy Rider would be a necessity to continue my knowledge into the world of motorcycles.But it did more than that. Not only is Easy Rider equally visionary and spectacular in its approach to the world of bikes, it preaches through its hard hitting issues that reflect the dramatic times of the 60's.Born in the late 80's, my knowledge of the 60's expands to funky clothes and classic music. Watching this film is like taking that first breathe of fresh air as you step out of the house. It breathes issues and entertainment onto a time that reflects the dramatic and significant time in American culture.The issues revolving around drugs in particular are unforgivably hard hitting, the LSD scene is the finest drug scene certainly I have ever watched, very sharp and realistic.The narrative takes into account the approaches to appearances, as evident in the café scene when the pair (including Nicholson's George) is decoded as bad people based on what they wear. With today's modern stereotypes including tracksuit wearing chavs or baggy clothed moshers taking a beating, it is almost easy to forget the way hippies were represented and frowned upon, especially the consequences they were dealt to. Here that is unbelievably executed by one of the most devastating endings you will ever see.Acting wise plaudits go to Jack Nicholson. His introduction spreads energy through the plot with a role contrast to his normal famous roles as Randall McMurphy and Jack Torrance. Fonda and Hopper do well but it's Nicholson who deserves praise.The direction however is the key element. Hopper's approach is very artistic and though brilliant, feels like an art project for the first hour without much happening in the plot. Once Nicholson enters the plot has a purpose and begins to generate that necessary realism as Hopper chooses different shots again. The cut back shots from one scene to the next and back again further increase the talent of the Speed actor and help project that devastating realism of a time this film isn't afraid to reflect.

After Easy Rider, Nicholson never looked back and got increasingly better roles with Five Easy Pieces, Carnal Knowledge, The Last Detail until finally getting the starring role in a great film, Chinatown. It is for Nicholson's short performance alone that I would recommend Easy Rider.There is some nice travel photography of the American West in the beginning of the film. Other than that, Easy Rider doesn't have much going for it. The anti-heroes are Dennis Hopper and Peter Fonda who make a big drug deal at the start of the film and spend the rest of the movie stoned and muttering what little dialog they have, mostly Wow, man. There is a very sad scene in a commune and an utterly dated and stupid scene in a New Orleans cemetery with everyone tripping on acid.

Ironically, the film came out onto the scene in 1969 as the hippie movement was dividing and losing strength in the country. Easy Rider is a very unique picture and was a key film in the advancement of the American film industry in the late 60's. One way to delve into this movie in a more precise way would be to focus on the idea of the American dream of freedom and how it is discussed and represented in this film specifically by the characters Wyatt, Billy and George.This idea of freedom is seen early and often in the movie. After Wyatt and Billy purchase and sell the drugs, and begin their journey across the country to the warm area of Florida, they make their first interaction with a family that lives on a farm, who live and survive off the land. Even though Wyatt and especially Billy (who begins eating before grace is spoken, and with his hat still on) feel out of place with this family, Wyatt makes a comment, saying how proud the father should be of his family and the way he is living his life. It appears as if Wyatt has seen his first example of what it is like to live the American dream of freedom, which appears to be what he is striving and looking for throughout the movie.Later, after picking up the hitchhiker and bringing him to his commune by the canyon, Wyatt gets his second glimpse of the American dream. The people living in this place are trying to distance themselves from the metropolitan areas, living of the land like the farmer's family. However, although they have less luck, Wyatt seems more drawn to their way of life. One girl, who seems very interested in Wyatt (she even calls him beautiful) implies that she wants him to stay there, and the hitchhiker they pick up also wants him to stay. However, Wyatt still wishes to explore America, to find more meaning in this country that he lives in.Unfortunately, as Wyatt and Billy move away from that place and continue further south and east they move farther away from their dream. They are treated unfairly and with prejudice when they are arrested for riding their motorcycles in a parade (parading without a license) and further south they are ridiculed, beat up and eventually killed by conservative southerners. In the campfire scene before George Hanson is killed, George and Billy have a conversation about their country and what has gone wrong with it. Although Wyatt keeps quiet during this scene, the conversation seems to say what Wyatt believes. Billy is upset about how they are being treated by Southerners, and George tells him it is because they represent freedom and equality, which is something that southerners are scared of.Later, after George's death and after Wyatt and Billy have left Mardi Gras and have made it to Florida, the two have one last conversation around a campfire. Billy tells him that they have done it, completed their task because they are rich and have made it across the country. But Wyatt responds by telling Billy that they blew it. This line is debated over its meaning, but it seems to mean that the reason behind the hippie movement has been lost; that Wyatt and Billy and the others involved in this movement have blown it because these other areas of the country are still filled with hate. Of course, this is made even more clear when they are killed by the rednecks in the pickup truck in the conclusion of the film.Easy Rider is an impressive film, one that is mostly driven by the need for the fulfillment of the American dream. Billy is searching for it in terms of wealth and retirement in a tropical place. Captain America (Wyatt) is looking for it in terms of a realization and a completion of what the hippie movement set out to accomplish. In the end the two fail at gaining this as they are shot down by rednecks who portray the opposite of the love and equality that Wyatt was searching for all along.

Peter Fonda, the son of famed actor Henry Fonda, and his friend, Dennis Hopper conceived an idea for a new kind of western. Everyone knows the quintessential westerns with such actors as John Wayne and Tom Mix. The idea Fonda and Hopper had was to make a western set in the modern era was that the new cowboys were bikers and motorcycles were the new horses. The film was about a pair of hippies who tread across America coming off a huge drug deal. They simply want to settle down and retire in Florida. On the way, they meet many people, including fellow hippies and a lawyer played wonderfully by Jack Nicholson. They also meet many people who don not like them based on their lifestyle. These people are prejudice against Wyatt (Peter Fonda) and Billy (Dennis Hopper) because they consider them hippies. Eventually this prejudice leads to their end. They are shot down by passing rednecks who do not like them due to their hippie lifestyle.The film shadows Arthur Penn's Bonnie & Clyde (1967) in ways because the main characters are portrayed as good but, in the end, they are killed by members of society who do not understand and do not wish to understand their lifestyle. The rebellious nature of Bonnie Parker and Clyde Barrow resonate out of Wyatt and Billy. The audience gets the impression that these rebellious youths are misunderstood by the rest of society. The film also has a fair amount of drug use in it. The two protagonists are always smoking marijuana and immediately at the beginning of the movie the audience sees them snorting cocaine. There is even a very strange sequence shot when the characters and their hired prostitutes decide to take LSD. The sequence is shot all mumbled and jumbled to portray to the audience how the drug affects a person. This theme of drug use in the film represents the times in which it is set.The times in which the film was made also had an effect on how Fonda, Hopper, and Terry Southern wrote the story. The late 1960s were trying times for Americans. The Vietnam War was at its height, the country had just come off the loss of their president, John F. Kennedy, in 1963. In April 1968, Martin Luther King, Jr. was shot in Memphis. There was a state of confusion in those years all around America. Later, when he was running for office, Robert F. Kennedy was killed in the kitchen of a hotel after making a speech. This was a time when things were hectic and out of place which really shows through in the film. The flagrant disregard for authority in the film reflects the rebellious nature of the people in the country. Wyatt and Billy die for what seems to be no reason at all. This also represents the needless deaths of John Kennedy, Martin Luther King, Robert Kennedy, along with the thousands over in Vietnam. The two characters are rather martyred at the closing of the film. Easy Rider presents Wyatt and Billy as righteous cowboys cut down at a young age because of prejudice. They feel as though they are truly free while society looks down upon them. Wyatt, throughout the film, is very optimistic while Billy always seems to be paranoid. The irony is that Wyatt is too optimistic and Billy proves to be correct in his feelings of paranoia. Easy Rider is a very well done and successful movie that has become an instant classic. It will not soon be forgotten.

Everything is fuzzy with close-up shots. There is no opportunity to see what the bigger picture is until the end of the shot. However, from the start Hopper had a vision and a significant design for each scene and action. After the successful cocaine sale that ended up financing their journey, Wyatt throws his watch away showing us how he no longer needs to keep time within this universe. He is going to be free, and is on the road for his freedom. From the start these travelers are laid back liberals with few concerns having to do with society. However, as their whereabouts are less familiar to them they experience the genuine prejudice against the far west culture. The residents of these towns are full of hatred for the long-haired men with their freedom.It appears that the protagonists of Easy Rider are Wyatt and Billy. However, their philosophy of life seems to be the only acceptable notion within this movie. They are even-tempered understanding men who are just along for the ride. While they respect the man who tills his own land to survive, they display opposite actions for their own lives. The American Dream used to be a desire for the wealthy of the land to come about from working hard on the land they called home. Meanwhile, Wyatt and Billy are not contributing anything positive to society by making their wealth through a successful cocaine sale and taking off on a journey full of drugs and laziness. This does not make the ending appropriate in any way, but it provides a view into the redneck hatred of their way of life.The ending is not entirely shocking but it is depressing. After Wyatt believes that they blew it the viewers recognize that they failed in their mission. From there, the only logical step is for them to be murdered by a redneck. Once the awareness of their failed mission hits them, they succumb to the fact that a different way of life is necessary for their survival, but since they are so deep into their current lifestyle, death becomes a way out. The fact that their assassin was a redneck does not necessarily mean that their way of life surpassed the far western attitude. Instead, the movie demonstrates another theme within the context of the movie, the cause of their anger toward Wyatt and Billy. The best way to explain this hatred would be through the lyrics that the movie provided in the song towards the end, It's Alright Ma (I'm Only Bleeding).For them that must obey authority/ that they do not respect in any degree/who despise their jobs, their destinies/Speak jealously of them that are free/cultivate their flowers to be/nothing more than something to invest in.

It is an incredibly powerful movie when you view it in these terms. The film is centered on two main characters&#151;Billy and Wyatt, two hippies with long hair and a revolutionary style who make a cocaine deal in the beginning of the film and then begin their journey across the West to Mardi Gras on their motorcycles. Throughout the film they are faced with different elements of discrimination against them purely because of how they were dressed and how they looked. This fact is introduced early on in the film when they try to go to a low-rate motel to get a room and the No on before the Vacancy is lit up as soon as they ask for a room.Billy and Wyatt are constantly portrayed as kind of new age cowboys throughout this film. With motorcycles in place of horses, these two biker hippies cut across the Western plains, complete with brilliant sunsets and scenery. The photography in this film is gorgeous and says a lot of Hopper as a director. The scenes where the two men (eventually three men, since Jack Nicholson eventually joins the two of them) are riding through the land are usually accompanied by rock and roll music. The music is vital to the vibe of the film&#151;it encompasses the freedom that the characters feel riding through the countryside, smoking pot and just digging life. The music represents them and they represent what the music stands for as well.What I took to be the film's turning point was the scene where George (Jack Nicholson) and Billy are discussing hippie culture and their ideals, mainly freedom. George is trying to explain to Billy that to the majority of the population at this time, freedom is dangerous and frightening. They see Billy and Wyatt and get scared&#151;they don't like to admit that there could be a freedom such as the one that Billy and Wyatt and the hippie culture represent, because that would mean admitting that they aren't free individuals either. This seems to be the point of the film&#151;the freedom that Billy and Wyatt were after and represented posed a threat to the rest of society, and it is for this reason that most of the people they interact with in the film have an animosity towards them. After hearing this, it does not seem surprising that the three get beaten in the middle of the night, that George is killed, that they are constantly discriminated against, or that ignorant farmers in a one-horse town kill the two free men at the end. Although they were, in fact, polite and upstanding people (with the exception of the coke deal and the pot smoking), the ignorant people of the towns that they went to never gave them a chance and instead judged them to be trouble makers and rowdy newcomers. In essence, they were killed for having more freedom and individuality than American society at the time allowed.

The generous rancher, the tired idealists in the commune, the average man trying to find his purpose in life (performed by the young, and at the time, gifted Jack Nicholson), the rednecks (of various forms) and the prostitutes.

But there is one movie that made Hollywood flop its concept of majestic movie-making to simpler, good, low-budget storytelling concepts nobody had made that impact so strong and so envied to date......it was Easy Rider.The story tells about 2 bike hikers Fonda and Hopper, with their budget money traded from drug-selling, cross-countrying their adventures in the long highways of America, come what they may encounter, not freakin' out. Meeting country families, hippie tents in the middle of the desert, small towns who thought they were a threat or a throne,sex and drugs, and even meeting a haywired lawyer, all mixed up in a bag that simply tells what freedom does mean along the way.It's too good a movie. Excellent backdrops of different types of music hovering along the vast background of America's natural beauty...highly contrasted with the natural instincts of certain Americans met along the way. A place so damn great marred by a somewhat wrong civilization. I'd never thought of that idea for a story concept. Very inventive. I do not say it relates to it's present situations of hippie culture by that time...but the elements that made the place seem entertaining. Nothing of politics or more intelligent form of story, just plain 'meet along the way' naturally (it's a funny thing they included the 'alien' concept as told by Jack Nicholson's funny role).A must for movie collectors to keep AND watch.

Of course, it's not a great story per se, but it is an accurate reflection that (fairly large) subculture and of what a majority of Americans felt -- and still do -- towards hippies and/or others who are considered undesirable by virtue of the fact that they simply march to a different drummer or lifestyle or political/religious opinion or p.o.v.... like believing in true freedom and what our Founding Fathers intended!

It is more like a sketch on Saturday Night Live - a good setup looking for an ending.This film is more a character study than a film as we know them today. You have Wyatt and Billy played by Peter Fonda and Dennis Hopper. Then you have the counterculture played by the members of the commune early in the film. Then you have the red necks who hate anyone different and will resort to violence to get people to conform. Finally you have Jack Nicholson who plays George Hanson. Hanson represents mainstream America who want to be hippies.How these characters interact for 95 minutes gives us the film.Wyatt and Billy are about selling and smoking dope and going where ever they want to go and doing what ever they want. They are individualists. They visit the commune and while they have some good times they leave because it is too constricting. Billy makes the comment at the gas station that he doesn't trust the commune guy who they give a ride too. He doesn't trust him because he is afraid he will find their money from the drug sale.Next they meet George Hanson. Hanson is intrigued by Wyatt and Billy. He would like to be like them and joins them on their travel.The group stops at a diner to eat and have a run in with some red necks. The men make snide remarks and the travelers are refused service just because of what they look like. There are some teen girls who go gaga over the travelers and that seems to set off the red necks. Late that night they attack the group while they sleep. George gets the worse of it. Wyatt and Billy aren't sure what to do with George but Billy goes through his wallet and takes what cash there was.They get to Louisiana finally and meet up with two girls, Mary, played by Toni Basil of Hey Micky fame, and Karen, played by Karen Black. The group trips out on acid in a weird scene set in a cemetery. Then the two men continue their journey.On the road they have another run in with red necks and the movie ends with a twist.While the film does a good job for most of the run, the ending seemed tacked on even with the twist.

I do like Dennis Hopper but when I think of his great performances, this is right at the bottom as I just found him very irritating and like he was trying to act stoned really badly.   I know  he was stoned during filming as was Fonda and Nicholson but I found this did nothing for Hopper at all.  When I think of Dennis Hopper I think of Blue Velvet, Apocalypse Now and True Romance.  The best part of the entire film was just them riding their bikes and conversations between Nicholson and Fonda.   This is the kind of movie that doesn't really go anywhere.  It's a road movie so just expect plenty of travelling and conversation after conversation but that is what makes Easy Rider.  Road movies are a lot of fun to watch as they are stories about finding yourself and coming up against obstacle after obstacle.   A lot has been taken from Easy Rider since it was made.  Taken that this film brought Hollywood to attention of the likes of Peter Fonda and Jack Nicholson.It was an intriguing film but it just doesn't hit you in the places where you think it should.  I have had argument after argument with people who say this is a landmark film and I think it was only because it was wanna of the first road movies of it's time and it came out in the late 60' when all most 20 something Americans only wanted to watch it, but if this was made in the 80's where the 60's and 70's seemed like a long distance memory then it would not have had the impact that everyone believes it deserves.   Trust me if you want to see films about LSD or Road movies then stick to films like Badlands, Performance ( Great Film starring Mick Jagger about a gangster hiding out in a hippie commune) and Wild At Heart who people say isn't a road movie but it certainly feels like one when watching it.   I'm not saying to avoid Easy Rider, watch it and try and see if the impact which it apparently has makes it onto you, because it is an interesting film to watch, for me it was interesting because I was trying to spot what was so fantastic about it.  One thing that stands in my mind is about fitting in, as Billy, Wyatt and &#133;. are in the café and are being looked at by a group of men who don't believe in the hippie culture and just glare at them with killing eyes. This is a issue that still carries on about how people do not understand others people cultural differences so that was interesting.   Peter Fonda was great and was Nicholson, Hopper in my opinion was just there and that was it, but then again he was directing the movie so maybe that's why he didn't seem as concentrated on the film as he looked because of his behind the camera moments.Great Soundtrack, flawed in many places, an ending which is pointless and doesn't seem appropriate for this kind of film and basically an overrated film with one or two good points.

Easy Rider made waves because it was not what anyone expected - there's no romance, there's little plot, characters come and go just like people do when you're on a road trip, not only are there not good wholesome values, but it hails anti-establishment values. Its filled with hippies, communes, seemingly irrelevent encounters with strangers, naked swimming and free love. But mainly, its filled with highway.Billy and Captain America just take to the road and ride throughout the movie. They come across people and situations every now and then, but mostly they ride while a super-cool soundtrack of late-60's tunes from Jimi Hendrix, Bob Dylan, The Byrds, Steppanwolf and more play. One of the people they come across, when they're put in jail in one town for parading without a licence is Jack Nicholson, in the role that made him a star. He had appeared in a few Roger Corman pictures before this, but after Easy Rider he was big time.Easy Rider was the coolest thing anybody had ever seen in 1969, and over three decades later, now most people aren't stoned anymore, i still think its one of the coolest movies ever made. You appreciate it even more if you know a little about the impact it had, which you can find out from Ted Demme's fun doco A Decade Under the Influence.I could totally understand why people found this so exciting - i understood it from the moment Born to be Wild began to play, and Billy and Captain American started out on the highway and the words Easy Rider came on the screen. To appreciate the freedom and landmark nature of this movie, you've got to have seen a few movies from the 50's and 60's, and while you might love them, appreciate the artificiality and conservativeness of the world they existed in. Easy Rider was a couple of longhairs, or hippies, cutting loose, hitting the road, and damn what the powers that be thought about it. It was the first real anti-establishment movie allowed by a major studio, which is why it was so influential.

He has fallen in with Dennis Hopper, his crass, ungracious, annoying foil who drags him from one locale to the next.There are two passengers in this movie who ride along with them, and how Hopper relates to each is a key to the film. In short, Jack Nicholson's Jack-ness in this movie tends to eclipse the first passenger--the Stranger on the Highway--just as the bad trip scenes in the cemetery are what everyone remembers most, not the playful commune scenes and the circular panning of the camera around a group of committed, loving men, women and children.

No film has ever made me want to go on a road trip as much as Easy Rider.The acting by Jack Nicholson is what is expected of him (I mean, he plays his character extraordinarily well, but it could be viewed as a typecast).I found that the character Fonda plays to be very idealistic, and also very enduring. Remember that by in large this is considered a stoner movie.  Not to say that anyone who doesn't smoke won't appreciate it, but that those who do probably have a greater appreciation of it.

From the opening scenes at the airport(The noise of those planes landing is terifying !), the score , the clattering noise of the 2 dirt bikes is poetry. That fantastic zoom in zoom out of Captain Americas wrist watch as he throws off the last tie to the conformist society that they are abandoning on their way to Mardi-Gras. From then on with Steppenwolf heralding a new dawn of civilisation, we are treated to the beauty of America, as the 2 choppers, Billy Bike and Captain America take us on a ride to knowhere, meeting some strange folk  on the way. The shots by Laslo Kovics are beautifull, full of colour, camera changes,like an orchestra, punctuate the scenes perfectly. The story line, many agree is bizare, and sometimes disjointed, but that doesn't matter, the images and sounds are enough to satisfy. And yes, this did herald in a new era of youth.

In a small town they meet George Hanson played by a brilliant(as always) Jack Nicholson. Hanson also wants to go to the Mardi Gras and so he jumps on the back of Fonda's bike with a Football helmet(I got a beauty!). In Redneck land Nicholson gets killed by a bunch of 1960's Republicans. In the end the same thing happens to our 2 bikers.What makes this movie so great is the fact that it isn't a cliche movie like a lot of those hippy movies. Another big plus is Jack Nicholson, although his role in the movie is pretty short. His alien monologue is very funny and his nick-nick all the time is even better. And then the soundtrack in one word Brilliant. Songs like If six was nine and I wasn't born to follow are two diamonds of that period and Born to be wild is an all-time classic because of this movie. The scene in which we see Nicholson on the bike for the first time is backed up by If you want to be a bird and this song makes the scene even more hilarious. The same for the scene with the song Don't Bogart that joint. On the soundtrack,which I own,there are also two Dylan songs but they are not sung by Bob himself because he didn't like the ending of the movie. The strangest part of the movie is the Mardi Gras/Graveyard scene in which we see Hopper,Fonda and two girls take LSD. This scene is an actual trip because all the drugs that were used in this movie where REALLY used. The scene is very chaotic but maybe because of that even more shocking and historical. The scene in which Fonda claims that both guys blew it is very emotional and unexpected.In the end,Easy Rider is a classic and should always be remembered as a movie about a very important period. 9/10  "},{"Title":"drugs! drugs! drugs!","Date":"1 November 2002","Score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Adventure, Drama","Review":"  I've seen EASY RIDER twice.

The American spirit is exemplified by Billy and Wyatt, who differ from their legendary, century- old wild-west prototypes only by the change from wild horseback riding to wild motor biking-  the hair-raising is about the same, minus firearms. America in the nineteen sixties is the setting for this tale of outlaws who care little for anyone but themselves, and whose scruples are few and far-between, their human connections sparse yet earthy. They are outlaws who harm no one, a mythical model of an America that youth want to see and hear about, especially in a decade which was undergoing major cultural shifts, with considerable debate surrounding the concept of nonviolence versus the need for revolutionary justice being particulary strong among those who were politically or even intellectually active in that tumultuous time.  The rough, independent, freedom, the alienation from roots, the Westward movement(in this case south eastern,) looking for a place to put down roots yet not wanting to stay put and to instead keep searching for adventure, for whatever gives one's life meaning, the sense of being a visitor passing through, - that represents the American spirit is captured on film before our eyes, and is subsequently shattered by the very forces that call themselves representatives of the Law. The implications of this tragic, losing battle will have the George Hansons of this world still reeling with justifiable indignation at this darker side of  society's misunderstanding of what it really means to be an American and a seeker of happiness, human dignity, individuality of thought and lifestyle,  and the Dream.   The film resembles,for good reason , not an American, Hollywood movie, but more of an avante-garde Art film, with its careful, innovative camera work and editing, with particular attention played to fitting popular,  now-classical rock to moving images and rounding out the characters and their psychological states, partially ad-libbed scenes, sparse dialogue, post-Method, superrealistic acting, and intricate, symbol-dotted composition of shots and scenes. Issues such as independence, freedom, alienation, generational as well as cross-cultural(counter- vs traditional-) conflict  and friendship are portrayed sensitively and with a fresh, but lasting uniqueness and artistic awareness that had never-to-fore been accomplished in Hollywood. The sixties had relatively little to do with why this film is a classic; it was simply the backdrop, brilliantly used as a framework by Director Dennis Hopper, and writers Hopper, Fonda and Southern to cinematically create a fine work of art that will last much more than a generation, and has reached much farther than their own shores in communicating classic themes as well as  new themes in an entirely new light.

He seemed to be the brains out of the bunch and knew what real happiness meant to him; probably more so than most folks. I figure the quote 'we blew it,' refers to the fact that they could've found peace at a few places they passed by in the beginning and failed to notice but instead kept on going to locations that they wouldn't fit in at.

Not just for the quality of the film itself, its direction or its acting but for the sheer effect the film imprinted upon Hollywood and the culture at the time.  When released in 1969 the movie had, quite simply, a seismic impact on filmmakers and the industry as a whole. After a decade or so of barren years the film industry and its studio bosses were faced with declining audience numbers and was losing the battle with the great scourge of film, television.   Columbia could not have predicted in a million years that a small, insignificent, low budget biker movie was about to change all that. Its success ultimately heralded a new age in cinema, whereby the old studio system gave away much of its power and resources to the new generation of young budding filmmakers.  It quite simply tapped into the mindset of the new audience, the sex, drugs and rock'n'roll generation. Watching the movie nowadays, some of its impact may have been eroded away by time and changing attitudes, but its enormous cult feelin' still remains. As a movie, it's very simple, small, personal and honest--essentially very European.  There is little storyline (Two guys do a drug deal and bike accross America) but in such a movie, it is not a loss. There is a whole aura attached to the movie, and a collasal feeling of freedom and hope but at the same time imprisonment.,inevitability and despair. A movie that can combine these conflicting emotions together is certainly a great one. Like *Bonnie & Clyde* it portrays the counterculture folk as the real victems. Peter Fonda and Dennis Hopper are the long haired hippies who, with the aide of a thumping rock n' roll soundtrack and drugs aplenty, ride their Harleys in search of the real America. Its subject matter is distinctly American but as previously mentioned it has a very European feel particularly the 'settlement' and the Mardi Gras scenes. However the movie doesn't glorify America and its ideals, as such. In fact, quite the opposite. Throughout the movie there is a certain darkness; a premonition of disaster hangs over the story. The ending is as shocking as ever before and the infamous line We Blew it lies as open to interpretation as ever before. Fonda and Hopper are assured and very wild as Billy and Captain America, Jack Nicholson makes a superb early career star appearence and whilst the directing is cheap it certainly isn't shoddy. It may be a bit disjointed and it may have lost some of its magic but the cult classic that is *Easy Rider* is still a momentous achievement and a film that altered the way Hollywood was run and arguably was a major catalyst for the New Golden Era of the 70's.  A true true cult classic- Essential Viewing.

There is one sequence toward the end that is of Fonda, Hopper and two prostitutes in the haunting above ground cemeteries of New Orleans right after Mardi Gras.

I have spent quite a bit of time in the USA and must say that Easy Rider is a perfect microcosmic metaphor of what is happening in the country now. If you are a US citizen you must try and watch this movie with a very open mind. Who knows if enough people watch this and similar movies or read books on the subject and sometime in the future will be able to convert the country back to its original values and principles. Beside all this this movie is stuffed with great dialogue (don't  miss the scene where Nicholson, Hopper and Fonda are having a smoke), the characters are instantly likeable, even if you are conservative and the biker image doesn't instantly appeal to you, the drunk lawyer (Nicholson) is seemingly a character which  does not fit in with the other characters yet he does so perfectly.There's much more I could say about this movie but I think you best go out and see it and form your own opinion.

It can be one of the most influential films ever made and still have no merit whatever. The Birth of a Nation proves the former claim. Now that I've seen Easy Rider, I have proof of the latter.For this reason - the fact that I now have a crushing rejoinder to anyone who wants to exalt some mediocre work or other on the dubious grounds that it offered something new or founded a genre - I don't regret seeing Easy Rider. My only regret is that I dozed off during the bit in which one of the actresses, or so I gather, bared her breasts. So there WAS something worth seeing buried in those 94 minutes. Just my luck to miss it.The only thing said in favour of this film, or at least said by people who are in favour of it, that I can't actually disprove, is that it perfectly captured the spirit of its time. (I'm tempted to say Big deal.) Maybe it did. I wasn't born then. I notice that every other person reviewing this film begins, I hadn't been born in 1969, but... Go to the comments section of a genuinely great film, like Andrei Rublyev, or a genuinely good one, like Take the Money and Run, or even one that merely fails to be crashingly incompetent, like Topaz, and see how many of THOSE comments begin with the author telling us whether or not he or she was alive in 1969. Still not having been alive in 1969, I can't with complete confidence deny that Easy Rider summed up the feelings of a generation. But I doubt it. To think that would be to think that people in 1969 were doped to the gills ALL THE TIME; that they didn't have a coherent thought in their heads. The film sure as Hell doesn't have a coherent thought in ITS head. Danny Peary sums it up best when he remarks that when Captain America tells Billy We blew it, it sounds like Peter Fonda, the producer, telling Dennis Hopper, the director, that they forgot to give their movie a point.If there IS a point, it's that any kind of social protest is the act of a degenerate madman. Is Easy Rider therefore the most virulently right wing, the most barking-mad conservative, film ever made? Possibly, but it undermines this status, even setting its utter clumsiness aside, with randomness, by (sigh ... spoiler follows) whacking off its protagonists at the end in an out-of-nowhere drive-by shooting, because it can't think what else to do with them.I missed the bit with the bare breasts, as I said, but I'm still pretty sure that the bulk of the film is set up to accompany the soundtrack album (which no doubt sold well). The pattern is as follows We listen to some inane blather. Then the riders get on their motorcycles, and we watch the scenery go by as we listen to track one. Then they stop, and we listen to some more of their inane blather. Then they get back on their motorcycles and we watch some more scenery (cue track two). Then they stop and we listen to their inane blather again. Et cetera. I think there's even a pause in the middle as the record gets flipped over.

Easy Rider is a poorly made, overrated celebration of debauchery and a childish look at vanishing America. A drug induced fantasy for the generation too lazy to play by the rules. Its immense appeal seems to be with those delinquents who pine for the self absorbed orgy that was the Hippie culture, and/or with those who aspire to such a future. It is also a foreshadowing of the propaganda methods that would later define the political party of choice of those involved, namely create a crisis then propose a solution. The crisis, Easy Rider would have us believe, is that America is turning into a hate filled, intolerant wasteland where murdering rednecks run rampant and freedom seekers die like dogs. The solution? Well, that is not only obvious from the way that the protagonists conduct themselves throughout, but indeed how that entire culture conducted itself in the years surrounding this film. Revolt! But revolt against what? Against people who look down upon dirty drug using vagabonds? Against people who seek to protect their sons and daughters from such vices? From people who seek to preserve their culture? I thought ruining cultures was something that only Christian missionaries did? It is important to stress that this film is bad, first and foremost, on it's technical merits. Every level is poorly made. The acting could be considered remarkable, but only if you consider following around a couple of pot heads and filming them rant and rave good acting. In that regard Hopper and Fonda are a real life Bevis and Butthead. Both Hopper and Nicholson went on to do excellent work after this film, but for the most part, perhaps Nicholson being a slight exception, there IS no acting in this film.That leaves us with the message of the film, which is exceedingly weak, and that is what I am attacking here.This is a perfect look into the mind of a hippie. This is how they see the world around them. Those of us who do not agree with them are nothing more than ignorant brutes. We operate out of fear, never conviction, or perhaps worse, we do operate out of conviction, our insidious evil convictions. And on the flip side, all the faults of the hippies are to be either sympathized or ignored, and they portray themselves as heroes. What a laugh.

The basis of the movie was traveling across country like they did in the old west, the only thing different was that they were traveling from West to East in Easy Rider instead of East to West like in the old western days. They were in search of a new life just like the cowboys used to be. Traveling around in search of a new better thing, which was the way of the west and that was the way of Wyatt and Billy in Easy Rider.The first big relationship that I saw between a western and Easy Rider was the campfire scenes. The first night on their trip they set up camp out in the woods and they are talking like they are cowboys. They talk between each other saying that they feel like cowboys out in the west fighting off Native Americans and animals to survive. This is the way the cowboys lived. They traveled all day and then gathered around the campfire at night and talked. That is the same thing Billy and Wyatt did, travel all day and camp out at night.The next big relationship is the way they are looked down upon when they come into new towns. When Billy and Wyatt get into town they go to the diner and when they walk in all the people are afraid of them, so they put them down and threaten them. The townspeople feel offended by their presence and they want them gone because they are something out of the ordinary. It was the same way in westerns, the cowboys came into town and everyone was intimidated by them and wanted them gone. The only people that were interested with both Billy and Wyatt and the cowboys are the girls of the town. The girls want something new and accept them in because they are attracted to them. This also makes the other townspeople even madder because the women like them more. Then the newcomers end up getting beat up or attacked in some other manner. This also happened in Easy Rider. The boys left town but the townspeople caught up to them and beat them with bats. So that is why there is a relationship between the townspeople in both westerns and Easy Rider.There were also a few minor similarities and symbols to relate Easy Rider to westerns. One similarity was when Billy and Wyatt got to the cult in the desert Billy was play shooting with the kids. In the westerns the kids would pretend shoot with the cowboys and Billy was doing the same because the kids saw them as outsiders and wanted to play with them. One of the symbols I saw was that when Wyatt had to change his bike tire, at the same time the cowboy behind him was changing the shoe on his horse. I thought this just showed that they were like cowboys because it was relating the two modes of transportation to each other. Overall I thought Easy Rider was just like a western movie because it had the same plot line with many similarities between the two.

I was in one of the many lines to buy tickets. As I recall, the movie was made for $250,000 which was unbelievable for shooting in film at that time. The file rolled out to national distribution, not because it was a Great Film, a Hollywood blockbuster. It rolled out because it struck the chord of the division in this country caused by young kids challenging the established thinking. The movie didn't mention the war but everyone in the audience knew it was part and parcel of the whole problem at that time. It wasn't a Lawrence of Arabia kind of film with big actors and big sets, it just resonated with the drumbeat/heartbeat of what was happening. It's still timely, given the stupidity of the current war and the current leadership that is trying to one-up tricky Dick with a new dick, shotgun-toting Cheney.

Being quite open-minded about films because of needing to adapt my usual watching for my film studies class, I stuck with it to the bitter, unsatisfying end. The only words I can use to describe this classic film are words that I don't think I'm allowed to say. The plot line was dull and full of pointless, unexplained non-sequiturs. The directing was painfully bad and the flash-sequence editing hurt my eyes. I spent the better half of the film waiting for the appearance of Jack Nicholson, one of my very favourite actors. But I'm afraid that even his cheeky-smiled performance couldn't salvage the flotsam of this film from the giant whirlpool of sewage. I did actually enjoy the LSD trip scene; the direction really picked up here, and I started to change my mind about it&#x85; THEN&#x85; what did they do&#x85; they killed off both protagonists in the last minute, leaving some very frayed and untied knots of the story. It left me thinking Was that it?!?! and grieving the hour and a half of my life I will never get back that I spent watching this piece of crap. If I could give it zero stars I would.

In there with others like Cuckoo's Nest, Clockwork Orange and the totally historically inaccurate Dances With Wolves. There is not one character in this waste of film who isn't a total low-life with no redeeming qualities. The leads are drug smugglers and all the people they meet on their journey are no better than them. They range from drunks to prostitutes to vicious rednecks who end the run of the drug dealers. I'm sorry, but I felt no sympathy for or empathy with anyone in this movie.I can find no reason to recommend seeing this trash except as a statement on how low people can sink.

There can be no spoilers for this movie because it wasn't about anything. It had no plot, no meaning, no nothing -- unless that was the point of the movie, which I guess it was. But making a movie about two pot-heads biking across country is not much of a plot, especially when the characters are so unlikeable. Does anybody care if they run into trouble from rednecks who don't like theses unbathed and unfriendly characters? In order to like this movie, you would have to be as stoned out of your mind as the people who were making it at the time. And even then you can give it only two wow man's.

I first watched this movie after seeing that AFI had ranked it among the top 100 movies in American film history. I was excited about a movie that showed the countryside, and motorcycles, and a journey, and all that sort. Oops, my mistake. This movie made the AFI list because of the era and feel appealed to hippies and hobos. This is not a movie made for normal people by normal people. This is Dennis Hopper's creation, and it is not worth the time.I strongly suggest that if you like good acting and good drama, please avoid this film. After you ignore my advice and watch this socialist crap for yourself, you will wish you had not.

Other than some nice shots of western scenery, it was mostly a waste of 90 minutes, so I scored it 3/10. This movie had the appearance of one made by high school students. Why would anyone have funded this, especially the fact that Dennis Hopper was the director? Some of the worst acting I have seen in a while, especially the Dennis Hopper character, who was a bad caricature of a hippie of the day. I can't believe the IMDb community rated this so highly! Well, I received the must be 10 lines message, so I'll add that perhaps the best acting was done by the members of the hippie commune; they were actually believable.

Fortunately, Jack Nicholson showed up and saved the film from total ruin. I guess what I disliked most about it was that it seemed to have been made without a script... and the ad libs were so lame for most of it that it bored me to tears. Now I read in the trivia section that they were mostly stoned and drunk for the filming... and ad-libbed their way through half of it - so I am vindicated.Now, almost 40 years later, I watched it again... and my basic feeling about it hasn't improved. The only character that the audience can care about is George...played by Jack Nicholson. He has charm, he has wit, his acting is creative enough that you KNOW that this man will go on to bigger and better things. He is the only saving grace in the entire film. Peter Fonda spends the entire movie looking cool... and his pronouncements sound like pretentious crap. Dennis Hopper has to be one of the most over-rated actors ever created by Hollywood. In this film he comes across as an insensitive creep. It is no surprise that many of the people working on the film quit because of his drunken and paranoid rages. When he gets killed, it is -in my estimation - a mercy killing... The main mystery here is why so many people seem to have loved this film. I suspect that this is because everyone likes to feel like a bit of a rebel. It is almost yelled at you from the screen that the only people who can appreciate the heroes of this film are people in the know, people who are cool, people who get it. If you DON'T like the characters portrayed (or the film by extension...), it is subliminally suggested that you are a Neanderthal; so how many people are gonna stand up and say this is junk? Yes it has some good music, yes the landscapes are often majestic and beautiful, and yes, the scene where Nicholson talks about how the concept of freedom is a dangerous one to be bandied about is a nice insight. But is that enough? Maybe for a fifteen minute short...but as far as I am concerned, Easy Rider has always been a disappointment, and it doesn't look any better now that it did originally. Some films never lose their freshness, and can be seen again and again with pleasure. This film is done with such pretension that even one viewing of it is more than enough.

POSSIBLE SPOILER Two scum bag drug smugglers, who deal dope because they're too lazy to work and have no regard for the pain and suffering their enterprise causes, get a big payoff from a crime boss and spend the next few days/weeks/months biking across the great Southwestern Desert of America and meander their way to New Orleans. One of these clowns even has the audacity to drape himself and his chopper in the Stars & Stripes motif. All this while thousands of upstanding young men were fighting and dying in Vietnam to defend the rights of these two ancestors of Beavis & Butthead.And since America isn't beautiful enough by itself, they enhance their metaphysical surroundings by constantly toking joints all along the way. Hope they don't crash into any school buses or other regular citizens who might trespass on their private DUI highways. Pete and Repete mooch off hippie communes or sit in road side cafés, bewildered because the locals are disgusted by what they are, scum bag drug smugglers. Their holier than thou attitudes eventually get them what most arrogant bad guys deserve. These two mental midgets get schwacked dead because they didn't have sense enough to stay away from people who hate idiots.I saw this waste of celluloid when I was young and in college.

Dennis Hopper and Jack Nicholson, high in the woods and chatting about various things?  I can't think of anything funnier, or maybe I can, but it is a truly unique experience to watch those two performances wasted on camera.  The story, if anything, is poking fun of the times!  So many modern hip people just refer to it as a bunch of Hippie rubbish.  But it is quite clear that Dennis Hopper and Peter Fonda knew exactly what they wanted to do with this story, and took the time to make fun of themselves and those around them.  The greatest joke was about those ignorant fellows in the deep south who want nothing more than to kill a longhair.  There is some great abuse that takes place in a diner, and it is also quite funny for a group of horny teenage girls to freakout when the two outlaw bikers(Hopper and Fonda), and the failed lawyer(Nicholson), hop on their motorcycles and hit the road. Deaths occur in a very unique way in this film, and I remember each death very well, which is great that this film could have that sort of lasting affect with me.  My favorite scene is when Dennis Hopper and Peter Fonda go on an acid trip with a couple of intense and creepy hookers, all of which takes place in a graveyard.  This is a fantastic road movie, and quite a surreal experience if you are open to it.  The film contains many popular hit songs of the time, which I guess is fine if you happen to dig the more commercial oriented late 60s Rock. "}]
