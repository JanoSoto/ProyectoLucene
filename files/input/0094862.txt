[{"Title":"A modern classic","Date":"29 March 2006","Score":"48 out of 51 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Fantasy, Horror","Review":" When people nowadays think of Chucky, the living doll, they think of the foul mouthed psycho doll complete with body modifications and a punky bride in a movie filled with funny one liners and black humor. However, when Chucky came to life almost 20 years ago, he was a real thrill that redefined the horror genre of the late 80s and spawned a series of imitators (some better than others).Director Tom Holland crafts this very original tale written by Don Mancini, where a dying sociopath (Brad Douriff) uses voodoo to transplant his soul to an inanimate toy. Catherine Hicks plays Karen Barclay, a single mother who gets the possessed toy for her little son Andy (Alex Vincent), not knowing what is hidden deep inside the doll.Despite its apparent cheesiness, Holland truly creates a haunting atmosphere filled with suspense by following the trick Steven Spielberg used in Jaws. While we know from the very beginning that the toy is haunted, we never get a glimpse of what he can do and neither does the characters; only the young Andy knows the truth, but nobody believes him.Unlike its current MTV-inspired incarnations, Child's Play starts a bit slow, but suddenly it turns into a suspense-filled roller-coaster with enough thrills to keep you at the edge of the seat. Holland directions truly makes the difference between a cheap B-movie and the classy film this one has become.Brad Dourif makes a superb job and this movie started his now-legendary career in the genre. Catherine Hicks is a very good lead character, surprisingly realistic, thanks in part to the very well-written dialog. Chris Sarandon completes the cast as the detective investigating the mysterious murders surrounding Chucky and Andy.The movie moves at a very good pace, despite its slow start; it has that 80s feeling and it is surprisingly violent for its time (it was released when rules were turning a bit stricter). It has great special effects and a very creepy atmosphere inside it's urban landscape.While many reviewers consider a flaw the fact that Chucky's possession is not a mystery, I believe that a lot of the suspense is in the fact that we know that, but the characters don't. It is a very well constructed film in the end, and definitely better than its current sequels. 8/10 "},{"Title":"Original and scary.","Date":"8 November 2000","Score":"62 out of 79 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Fantasy, Horror","Review":" I've seen this brilliant horror movie over twenty times so far and it is still great.Child's Play is wonderfully original-a great concept(the soul of a serial killer in the puppet)and villain(Chucky!)are perhaps the keys to it all.Plenty of shocks and scares,pretty good acting and lots of violence.The direction and editing are so tight and carefully done.Now I can see why this movie was such a huge success in 1988.Managing to be both frightening and classy,this is a nerve-wracking experience.I actually found Child's Play to be a very scary film.I did not find it too gory,but what gore there is it was done to heighten intensity levels to the extreme.All in all,I wholeheartedly recommend it to any open-minded viewer,who likes to watch horror movies.The hammer in the head scene still gives me goosebumps.

Especially by 1980s standards. There's no brainless teenage cattle, no gratuitous nudity, and no ridiculously high body count. If anything, Child's Play runs like an episode of Rod Serling's The Twilight Zone. It's creepy, but ultimately not shocking. This is no coincidence. An episode of The Twilight Zone called Living Doll used a similar premise.Child's Play is done very well, considering it's about a serial killer who uses voodoo magic to transfer his soul into a doll. The acting is way above average for a horror movie and the momentum builds nicely. The viewer is forced to wait quite awhile before they actually see Chucky kill anyone. If anyone has seen VH1's I Love the 80s then you've probably seen Dee Snider mock the movie It's a doll! Step on it! It's over!. If Chucky tried to go on a killing rampage, this would work. But he doesn't. He uses stealth and cunning to make up for the failings of his diminutive body. He reveals his true self only to young Andy, the boy who gets him as a birthday present. He kills all his hapless victims without much trouble. After all, who would suspect an innocent little doll could kill you when you're not looking?Perhaps the biggest problem with Child's Play is that it was billed as an evil doll movie. Chucky was on all the posters and commercials, knife in hand. It would have worked much better as a suspense thriller, where you suspect that little Andy Barclay is the murderer.Despite it's failings as a horror movie, Child's Play is still a great movie because it paints a dismal and accurate picture of the 80s the frustration of single parenthood, the dark dangerous inner cities, and trying to get your kid that overpriced toy that they just *have* to have. Child's Play also came at a time when dolls were really popular Teddy Ruxpin, Cabbage Patch Kids, My Buddy, and Kid Sister were all hot items. Little kids loved these things, but there's something inherently sinister about dolls. Those glassy eyes and perma-smiles seem insincere.Overall, Child's Play is a movie that probably succeeded because it was in the right place at the right time. Nonetheless, it's worth at least a few viewings. Chucky is easily one of the top 3 horror movie villains of the 1980s along with Freddie Krueger and the Gremlins.Rating 4 out of 5 stars "},{"Title":"This is what a bad movie looks like when it's well made.","Date":"1 December 2004","Score":"44 out of 52 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Fantasy, Horror","Review":" Child's Play is built upon a pretty laughable premise &#150; some hardened criminal finds himself wounded and cornered by the police, so he chants some mystical words, lightning clouds form in the sky, and he transports his soul into the body of a kid's doll of the My Buddy variety. But the movie is so well made that it is able to remain effective despite its questionable premise, kind of like Darkman, another movie with something of a goofy plot but that still manages to come off as a great action horror film.Some of the best moments in the film come early on, before anyone but Andy realizes that Chucky is alive. Kind of like what Steven Spielberg did in Jaws, director Tom Holland leaves Chucky as a lifeless doll for a good portion of the beginning of the film. As is to be expected, it's much more difficult to show a living, running, stabbing, screaming doll than it is to show a regular doll, which itself manages to stare blankly in such a way that you know there's something going on in its head.There's nothing worse than hearing someone criticize the acting skills of a little kid, but I have to admit that I found Alex Vincent's performance as Andy a little trying at times. Granted, the kid deserves a lot of credit for performing reasonably well in a horror film at the age of 7, which is certainly more than I could have done at that age, but for every time that he effectively portrayed a scared little kid, which happened often, there were at least as many times when he spoke with the wooden monotone generally associated with reading a cue card.That being said, the effects in the movie are very impressive. There are a few goofs in there, but you have to look pretty hard to find them, and the doll itself was very well done. Brad Dourif makes one of his earlier appearances, showing up in Child's Play just long enough to get shot and then transfer his body into the doll, and then spend the rest of what is now a total of five movies trying to get out of it, which may have something to do with the fact that his voice is more famous than his face. He was mostly known as the timid Billy Bibbit from One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest before he did Child's Play, and the success of this movie clearly had a significant impact on the rest of his career, since so many of his later performances were in decidedly dark roles.Note watch for the only funny scene in the movie, which my itself is so funny that any other comic relief isn't even necessary. As Chucky ascends in an elevator, and elderly woman notices him, but her husband tells her to just leave it, whoever forgot it is bound to come back for it. When she exits the elevator, she looks back with a grimace and says, 'Ugly doll&#133;' Chucky's response is one of the funniest things I've ever seen in a horror film.

The doll is incredibly eerie with its red hair and deep eyes, and goes by the name of Chucky saying things like, My name's Chucky...wanna play?  Although much of the plot is very predictable(especially the ending), the execution of the plot is first-rate.  Add to this some earnest acting from CatherineHicks, Chris Sarandon, and especially Alex Vincent playing a six-year old, and you have a pretty entertaining feature.  The special effects are also first-rate, and the doll seems to actually be alive.  Brad Douriff adds his voice to the demented Chucky, and his voice is evil personified.  Dinah Manoff has a small role, but it is an important role which she plays very well.  The atmosphere is definitely set on suspense and it is a rollercoaster of a ride as we see the doll slowly become human and seek out his only murderous hope for salvation.  Good scares!

And those big dolls like 'My Buddy', that even as a kid I knew were creepy.Script, acting, music, mood, atmosphere, direction, scares, everything works and that's why I give it the high rating it deserves.Brad Dourif was the perfect choice for the voice of the Chucky doll. It's sinister and angry and darkly sarcastic. He is what I consider to be one of the all time great underrated actors.The film is bleak. There's nothing happy about it although the good guy doll commercials insist it's playtime.After this film, the only sequel I highly recommend is Child's Play 2, which I love just about as much as this one. Part 3 wasn't bad. Bride of Chucky was an interesting new direction to go in, but the feeling of the first couple of films is long gone by then, and Seed of Chucky was about the same.

It almost takes half the movie for that to happen. It stays intense from that point and certainly keeps your attention. The only change I would have made was to the end the movie five minutes earlier, but they tacked on something that wasn't needed.The doll's owner Andy, (Alex Vincent) is a cute little kid and Alex does a decent job of acting while Catherine Hicks is fine as his mom. A familiar face in the '80s, Chris Sarandon, adds his talents as a detective.Instead of all the stupid sequels, I would have preferred to see a remake done, now that special-effects have made such great advances. For instance, at least with the VHS I have, Chuckie's lips aren't even in sync with the dialog! He walks a little too wooden-like but the other special-effects were just fine. Nothing is to be taken seriously, anyway. It's just a silly voodoo-type story (you should hear the explanation of who Chuckie is) and just played for a scary horror film. On that level, it works because it IS scary.

However, he performs a chant right before he dies. Karen Barclay (Catherine Hicks) is a single mother who works in a jewelry department in a department store. She lives in an apartment with her six-year-old son Andy (Alex Vincent), who is like any normal six-year-old. He loves the television show `Good Guys', and they have lots of toys and dolls that you can buy. When his birthday comes around, he doesn't get a $100 Good Guy, but Karen buys one from a peddler off the street for $30. However, that doll, whose name is Chucky, is actually filled with the spirit of Ray, who tries to kill everyone.At times this can be pretty effective, even scary, even when they add to it with predictable, cheap scares. When Maggie (Dinah Manoff, who overacts throughout the entire movie) is slowly walking through the kitchen with no music, with the phone in plain sight, do you think it's going to ring? Thankfully, there aren't too many of them. The entire plot is pretty clever, not just a `Craven' or `De Palma' theme. Also, the puppetry of Chucky was pretty good, for it being 15 years ago. The cinematography was good, with many first person shots, which were effective.Dourif, who played a gentle man in One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, was very good, especially in the beginning, when we actually saw him. Why he isn't a big name now is beyond me. Hicks was good for what she was required to be panicky and caring to Andy. Sarandon didn't do anything for me, as the obligatory police officer. Vincent talked like stereotypical movie children did, enunciating every syllable.The music really helped, with it booming to prove its point of being a horror movie. It could have had some humor, like other horror movies do, to help it out some. Since it's less than 90 minutes and a horror films, they didn't worry about anything like plot holes or continuity errors. A few I noticed how DID he go into Chucky, besides the chant, why would the Chucky doll be burned up, the dates continuously change. That scene with voodoo was very cool. That's about all I can say, so I won't say any more.My rating 7/10Rated R for language and violent situations.

After that it starts to get slow and generic even with the killer doll with things not making much sense (and I am not talking about the Chucky doll thing either). But when Chucky starts his sinister cacklying and cursing that he is known for the movie does pick up. The build up to that point isn't that bad though and I can understand why they had to go in that direction at first. It does add a sense of mystery even if the audiences does know what is going on from the start. The trademark Chucky voice really does add flavor to this slasher. As a matter of fact I wouldn't be shocked if Heath Ledger was inspired by Chucky for his role in The Dark Knight now that I think about it. It's cool to see Chucky not going on that unstoppable killer slasher direction, he uses stealth and pulls tricks to kill someone. Plus whenever found, he could just act like a regular doll. Which actually does adds to making him quite a dangerous and sinister killer. This does not have a lot of blood and gore, nor does it have a lot of body count but it does have entertainment value for a horror slasher movie. Overall this is a slasher movie that had a lot of cool and new elements to work with when it came to the direction at the time.

It had reddish-brown hair, blue overalls, and a cheery, striped shirt. It also looked exactly like Chucky, the serial killer plaything featured in Tom Holland's 1988 film Child's Play.As one of the little tykes who was ever-so-proud of his My Buddy, the release of this movie was devastating. I didn't watch it until I was much older, but simply seeing the trailer on TV was enough to make me petrified of the notion that an otherwise innocent amalgam of plastic and synthetic fiber lurked on the other side of my bedroom closet door while I slept.Fast forward to 2010. I'm nearing age 30 (yikes), and I've just given the tale about a murdering psychopath who transfers his soul into the body of a toy via some sort of intangible voodoo another chance. Even though the exposition for this one is amazingly idiotic, it's clear that screenwriter Don Mancini was onto something. In the most superficial sense, there is something eerie about dolls. Their fixed expressions, when viewed in the right context, can make our blood run cold. As irrational as this notion is, it nevertheless has some merit, and this is what makes Child's Play the unlikely success that it is.What's even more disturbing about the movie is that it has our six year- old protagonist&#x97;Andy&#x97;exploring the seedy underbelly of Chicago in an effort to aid his newly acquired companion. Despite his initial naivety, the kid eventually wises up and realizes the danger he's in. What follows is a comically grotesque battle that sees Chucky take on a police officer, a psychiatrist, a witchdoctor, and a babysitter (among others).What's especially great about Child's Play is the final act, where our indestructible villain is shot, torched, and dismembered. He's basically the terminator of dolls; as soon as he seems to be vanquished, he reappears, oozing pus and stuffing, ready to slice and dice anyone who interrupts his perpetual mission of spiritual transferal.As one would hope, no one involved with Child's Play takes things too seriously (it would have been an utter disaster had this not been the case). Because of the lighthearted nature of the movie and how downright silly it is, there's no reason not to call it a box-full of harebrained fun.It's also the quintessential killer doll movie. That's got to be worth something.

But is it as revered or loved as the other horror classics? Well, no. It is, however the quintessential toys coming to life to kill people movie. Also, For what it's worth it's a pretty good horror movie considering the subject matter. If any story about a doll killing people is going to have a chance to be believable or scary, it's the story of Child's Play, the first installment in the Chucky series. The reason for this is the surprisingly well written back story and origin of Chucky. I won't give spoilers but I was actually interested in how Chucky came to be an evil doll that murdered people. I mean, they at-least attempted to give a valid reason of how this could possibly exist which was fun. Chucky does a decent job being menacing and almost believable until he begins to really speak. There are some freaky scenes of short dialog that really get you going, but when he speaks too much, it becomes kind of hokey and laughable (as you would imagine, it's a doll). I enjoyed Brad Dourif in the beginning of the film but as Chucky's voice, I would rather have everything said in that creepy doll voice than the voice that actually comes from the doll. The less human the doll was the creepier it was. I felt they kind of lost that as the film moved along. Also, there are a few death scenes that were shot poorly and completely un-believable. That being said, to pull of ANY believable and creepy scenes at all using a doll as the murdering villain, is impressive, and they made a handful of scenes really well.

It was good because we never actually saw the doll DO anything except talk and threaten. 'Child's Play' does the same for a good chunk of the movie. The suspense is excellent, and Chucky is terrifying even when not active! We start to see Chucky move and talk, and curse and chase people but it does not ruin the movie.

For example, when the batteries fall out of the box, we can see the wheels start turning in Karen's head and everything starting to fall into place. It's not a bad little scene, but it could have been better. Apparently, the original script called for a period of time in which the audience would be unsure whether Andy or Chuckie were committing the murders, and the battery scene would have been the first real evidence that Chuckie was actually alive and a killer. That would have been a wiser move and made for a better movie. Another example of *Child's Play* as bad-movie-done-well is the car scene in which Chuckie tries to kill Mike; this thing goes from patently ridiculous (he had a chance to stop the car in the time between getting out of Chuckie's choke-hold and when Chuckie pushes the accelerator) to genuinely scary when Chuckie is scrambling around outside the car while Mike is trapped inside. That's good stuff.But it's just sad that all of the human actors--including Chris Sarandon--get upstaged by a foul-mouthed doll. The sardonic and sharp-tongued best friend Maggie is a tired stereotype (even in 1988). By the time the 9 o'clock news rolls around, I didn't really care if she survived or not, which is not a good thing. And Alex Vincent, the kid who plays Andy, is not good at all. His lines are often delivered with what I can only call bewilderment--as if he has no idea what's going on in the scene or in the story. That's not surprising since he was about six years old at the time, so he can't be faulted for it. The movie, however, can (and should be). In the end, there are a lot of horror movies I'd rather watch than this one, but I'd rather watch this than *Jaws 3-D* or *Hellraiser Bloodlines*.

Also Vincent was a TERRIBLE actor--but he was only 7 when he did this.

The plot of the film moves very well, with new twists and new locations at every turn, doing a great job of hooking you in.

Good ole' Chucky. Our friend till the end.I was born the year Child's Play crept into theaters and began of legacy of horror for audiences around the world. And I grew up in the heyday of Chucky- the end of the 80's and early-to-mid 90's. I remember seeing that doll everywhere for the first 15 years of my life. And it terrified me, as someone with an older sister that owned a number of Cabbage Patch dolls that fairly closely resembled him. When I was a young child, I was even convinced her dolls were actually Chucky in disguise, coming to get me. It also didn't help that she used to prank me with them as well, further solidifying the FACT that Chucky was going to get me in my mind.I have a lot of wonderful memories of the fear that Chucky used to instill into me. (It's funny how memories of childhood fear can eventually turn into nostalgia.) But oddly enough, I didn't see the films themselves until I was quite a bit older. And by that time, I was over my childhood fear, and ready to see the films for what they really were.And I was surprised to discover how very decent, solid and well- structured the original Child's Play is. And how truly creepy it actually was at times.The film opens with the death of serial killer Charles Lee Ray (Brad Dourif), who is gunned down in a toy-store by officer Mike Norris. (Chris Sarandon) With his dying breath, Ray is able to choke out a slew of magical words, and transfer his soul into the last thing he touched- a Good Guy- the most popular, trendy of children's dolls. Eventually, the doll finds itself in the hand of young Andy Barclay (Alex Vincent), and soon after, mysterious events begin to plague the life of he and his mother Karen. (Catherine Hicks) What could it be? It surely can't be the doll, Chucky, despite Andy's insistence that it is... could it? (Well, obviously it is, and this fact was spoiled for audiences through all the advertising.)Directed by Tom Holland, the film is based on a story by first-time screenwriter Don Mancini. There's a lot of lore about Mancini's original script (a darker satire about how advertising and consumerism can negatively affect children), and how Holland and the other writers radically altered it. And I do think it's a shame. Even though the final film is quite solid, hearing the stories of just what was in the original script has left me wishing we could have seen the intended original vision. ...but I digress.Holland gives some fairly expert direction to the story. While I'm not really a fan of Holland (his other work being mainly comprised of projects I feel were misses), he guides the narrative with competence and style, building a rather good sense of dread and wonder through key camera-work and composition. His work is slick and lends itself well to the material, and I also enjoyed his ability to nail a few really good gags in addition to delivering the thrills.The performances are uniformly quite good, and do much to ground the otherwise sort-of silly storyline, making it hit home and giving a sense of believability. Hicks and Sarandon in particular knock it out of the park. You really buy Hicks as a mother desperate to figure out what is happening, and doing her best to protect her child. Brad Dourif is also a revelation as not only serial killer Charles Lee Ray, but also the voice of the possessed doll Chucky. This truly is Dourif's franchise when it comes to on screen presence. He's menacing. He's amusing. And while others may have phoned in their performance, Dourif approaches the material seriously, as though he's getting ready to get up on stage and deliver Shakespeare. It helps a lot that he treats the script with respect.Frankly, there isn't much I can say against the film, as it seems to fundamentally succeed (if not completely excel at) what it sets out to accomplish. Though I will comment that I feel I cannot give the film a higher score, due to what I feel is a concept made shallow through rewrites. And I feel that Holland tips his hat too much when it comes to the scare sequences. The film almost seems to be going for an angle that tries to suggest Andy may be responsible for what is happening (which was evidently a large element of Mancini's original script), but Holland's construction contradicts this, by making Chucky the only possible cause. (And I'm not spoiling anything by saying that.)Still, I feel this is quite a good little horror film of yester-year. It's one of those rare slashers that feels like it has some thought and heart put into its production. And it emerges as one of the finer examples of 80's Horror done right.Child's Play easily earns a quite good 8 out of 10 from me. And it's a classic that is definitely worth checking out for fans of horror and suspense. (Or people who, like me, grew up afraid of that darned doll!)

Like most horror films, the first one will always be considered the best. It's currently spawned five sequels and they're all an acquired taste, either too horrific, too similar, or too comedic to appeal to everyone. However - like the Three Bears' porridge - was just right.It's mainly horror - about a serial killer who, on his death bed, puts his soul into a child's doll, only for it to be bought by an innocent family. However, there's a decent amount of black comedy thrown into the mix. You can't really have a three foot high, plastic baddie without making it just a little bit humorous (and the humour comes from the devilishly brilliant delivery from (voice artist) Brad Dourif. However, he's just a voice - the real actors all play their parts, too. You could say that the main star is a six year old boy and, child actors can be hit and miss at the best of times. If he was incorrectly cast then you may end up rooting for the evil doll. Plus there's his mum - strong, but never over the top so, but the real bonus points go to the long-suffering cop, charged with investigating this family's crack-pot tale about killer dolls with souls of serial killers inside them.If you like horror then you should have already seen this. If you haven't been introduced to the Child's Play/Chucky franchise then this is the best place to start.

Unfortunately for him, his new prize is possessed by the spirit of infamous mass strangler Charles Lee Ray, and when the repackaged slayer gets up to his old tricks again, no one believes Andy's insistent claims that Chucky did it. The most effective aspect of Holland's execution of the material is how he's able to wring some genuine scares out of a premise that automatically lends itself to unintentional comedy. Though the film wisely acknowledges its own goofiness by peppering the slasher elements with some keenly rendered zingers, the story itself is played fairly straight and the overtly sadistic nature of Chucky's homicidal rampage ensures that the tone remains as dark as the circumstances will allow. We pretty much know going in what this flick will have in store, but the excellently crafted pace generates an admirable amount of tension, and the way each propulsive layer of the plot unfolds makes for an engrossingly taut experience which belies the basic fact that our villain here is a four foot tall plastic plaything.Holland certainly deserves credit for much of the film's impact, but his accomplishments are handily eclipsed by FX whiz Kevin Yagher, who created the chillingly cherubic Chucky doll and brought him to life. Yagher's orchestration of the mechanical effects that allow Chucky to switch from beaming best friend to snarling psychopath remain captivating even in the modern CGI era, and the level of realism presented with this decidedly unreal character is startling and magical. Though later installments of the Child's Play franchise would replace Yagher's puppetry with whatever technological trickery was available at the time, the Chucky icon would never again be this frightening and primally savage, or look nearly as impressive.The limited capabilities of the the era actually augment the illusion rather than hindering it, and since the focus of the film is a plastic creation with limited jointing instead of a human being with full articulation, the doll's somewhat stiff and mechanical movements are more fitting than the sort of fluid animated motions you'll see in, say, Seed Of Chucky. The scenes of our blade-wielding antagonist methodically stalking down the hallway of the apartment where much of the action takes place are fearsome and indelible, and the sudden expletive-laden shift which occurs the first time Chucky reveals himself to the disbelieving mother of his friend till the end still packs a whopper of a jolt no matter how many times I've seen it. Despite Holland's sure-handed direction, this flick simply wouldn't work as well as it does without the efficiency of Chucky's menacing mien, and even if the notion of a killer doll strikes you as silly, there's no denying how powerfully that device is brought to fruition here.Our non-robotic cast does an excellent job as well, particularly the always welcome Chris Sarandon, who portrays skeptical homicide detective-turned-intervening hero Mike Norris. Young Alex Vincent is a bit over his head tackling the wide range of emotions his role as Andy requires, but he does a great job considering his age, and the final bitter punchline he delivers to Chucky is a true gem. Brad Dourif seems to relish the excesses he's allowed to indulge as the voice of Chucky, and his witty, mirthfully malicious banter adds as much nuance and actual character to the doll he inhabits as Kevin Yagher's machinery does.There isn't a ton of gore to be had here, but that dearth is actually pretty crucial to the plot since the initial killings are staged to look like accidents. Things get slightly more gruesome as the film proceeds, but the emphasis here is decidedly on suspense rather than splatter, so bloodthirsty viewers should probably be aware of that before they start imagining what nasty uses Chucky will concoct for the butcher knife he's grasping in most of Child's Play's promotional art.Some slippery mythology hampers the storyline a bit, and while the introduction of an inner city voodoo shaman responsible for teaching Chucky his Dambala trick is essential to our understanding of the film's rules, the wisdom he dispenses ends up being the lone befuddling portion of this caper. You see, the impetus for Chucky's climactic pursuit of Andy is the necessity of shifting his essence into the body of the first person he revealed himself to, otherwise he'll be trapped forever in the doll vessel he occupies throughout the film. I get that, and I suppose it makes some sort of sense in the realm of Child's Play, but the fact that Chucky's black magic mentor even knows this does not. I'm not intimately familiar with sorcery, but it strikes me as odd that the transference of human souls into talking toys apparently happens with enough frequency for there to be an established course of conduct when that occurs.This is ultimately a minor complaint, and taken as a whole Child's Play is a thoroughly enjoyable thriller. Though the rest of the extended franchise, with the lone exception of the surprisingly sharp Bride Of Chucky, is essentially useless, this inaugural outing has enough strong moments to make it readily apparent why subsequent film-makers were eager to get more mileage out of the concept (sadly, the foreboding finale suggested by the exit frame here was never explored). Even if the sequels have left a sour taste in your mouth, do the original the justice of giving it another look. Hi-de-ho, ha ha ha.

Even for its time it can scare the living crap out of anyone. So what if it's dated, Chucky is a terrifying creation and no matter what, it will give the desired scares.So how does this good guy doll become such a horrific killer? Well it is almost like possession except it's not with a real body. Catherine Hicks plays the mother of her son Andy played by Alex Vincent. Andy is the sweetest kid you could find; innocent and although he acts just like a normal kid, he has respect for his mother and what she does for him and that's what gives him his cuteness. I feel that Alex Vincent is the best actor in this film. For the most part Andy keeps his cool but even when he started to cry, I felt like crying, he was that good.Although the effects in this film are dated, I feel that they work really well. Everything from the way Chucky walks, his facial expressions, his eye movement, they all make him look very life-like. What's even more interesting is that as Chucky is more and more on screen, the more human he becomes; and not just because he is told that, but by his looks. Look at him closely as the film progresses to its finale. You'll understand what I mean. I'll say this as a clue, if you were to compare the differences between the good guy version and Chucky's end result, they are nothing alike.What I like most about this movie is the whole atmosphere. The way the story is set up is just too good to set aside. The dialog is memorable and so is the musical score by Joe Renzetti. Almost each moment carries the emotions of fear and dread. Those kinds of soundtracks can really freak people out. I feel that if this were to be left out, this movie would not as scary. Adding to the effect is how no one believes Andy that Chucky is alive. This creates even more fear because how is this little kid going to convince everyone he's not crazy?

It's a great roller coaster ride of a film as we learn about how Chucky must capture the boy and take over his body before he is trapped in the doll forever.Many sequels were made, but this was definitely the best one. I've read a remake is in the works. I hope that if/when it's remade, Catherine Hicks comes back to play the mom. She could still pull it off.8/10 "},{"Title":"And I call myself a horror fan? Finally saw this 23 yrs. after...","Date":"21 February 2011","Score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Fantasy, Horror","Review":" It is with great shame that I admit that 23 years after it's original release, I FINALLY see Child's Play. The basic premise of the movie sounded so stupid and absurd I always automatically avoided it. Then, when the umpteenth sequels came pouring out, I thought that belief was confirmed. Boy, was I wrong.It takes a director with a very deft touch and steel-like confidence to pull something like this off, but Tom Holland does it, and he manages to make it creepy and scary and funny and wildly entertaining all at once. I now understand the large fan base, and my hat is off.See, Holland KNOWS how potentially ridiculous this story is, and he effectively puts you in the seat of the non-believer (personified by Catherine Hicks, who turns in an impressive rendition of slightly-befuddled, but earnest mom Karen Barclay). Holland plays it smart by keeping the Chucky-antics almost off camera for about 30-45 minutes of the film. It's kind of the same effect Spielberg got by hiding the shark in the first half of Jaws. And when he DOES give you a glimpse, it's freakishly mind-blowing. The scene where you see Chucky dart from a hallway opening behind unsuspecting Dinah Manoff is jaw-dropping in both it's fright-factor and it's outlandishness. Because it DOES look REAL.The special effects, especially for this time period in horror films, are impressive to say the least. The acting is solid and well-done, with just a hint of irony by all involved.And as for Alex Vincent, who played little Andy, I'm sure hard-core fans know the answer to this, but how he got through this one without suffering severe trauma and permanent nightmares is beyond me. It's a little beyond the role of Danny in The Shining!

Everyone knows the story. A serial killer, the Lake Shore Strangler (Brad Dourif) is mortally wounded by a Chicago cop Mike Norris (Chris Sarandon). He manages to break into a toyshop, and with his dying breath, says a voodoo chant that transfers his soul into the body of a doll.I wouldn't be too surprised if after reading that paragraph, you might think Child's Play was an idiotic film. But thanks to Tom Holland's confident direction and the taut editing, what we have instead is a very effective horror film, not to mention satisfying because the sheer amount of enjoyment to be had is so unexpected.Chucky has become quite an infamous figure since his origin in 1988. As the sequels progressed, he has skirted the waters of controversy with the Jamie Bulger murder, and eventually evolved into black comedy when Bride of Chucky was created in 1998. But with the original film, no-one had ever heard of him, and didn't know what to expect.Child's Play is a horror film through and through. But it also has traces of light humour, elements that would be further expanded upon in the future. Holland shows a style of horror-film directing similar to Wes Craven. The scene where Maggie is babysitting Andy (Alex Vincent), the lad who ends up with Chucky, she is being stalked by Chucky. In the background, the TV is showing a horror film, almost acting as an internal commentary of the events.Holland's direction is truly excellent, allowing Child's Play to transcend it's admittedly slender plot, into a gripping, suspenseful horror show. This is a film that doesn't insult the intelligence of it's audience. It toys with our expectations, giving us enough subtle hints to tip us off of what's going on, but not too much that it doesn't give the game away.For the first forty minutes, we don't even see Chucky moving around. Except for the occasional blinking, head turning, and mumbling the dialogue the doll has been programmed with. These are all things the doll can do anyway, and they're incorporated into the plot whenever it demands it.But as Chucky plots revenge on those who betrayed him, we realise there will come a time when we will see him in all his glory. And that time comes when Karen Barclay (fiestily played by Catherine Hicks), Andy's mum, threatens to torch Chucky, and he comes to life right in her hands. This is when the puppetry comes into play. And for 1988, they're not half bad.Some of the facial expressions they get on Chucky are alarmingly sinister. And some of the movements Chucky makes took me by surprise. In one single continuous shot Chucky walks from one end of a room to another, and we actually see him climb up onto a bed. Or another one where he is in a fireplace, and kicks the grate away. This goes to show what puppetry can be capable of when given the chance.Brad Dourif lends his voice to the character, making Chucky into a frightening presence, complete with put-downs, puns and maniacal cackle. There are times when his voice isn't always synchronised with his mouth like it should be, but the effects are well above average for the time.Some of the plot elements concerning Chucky possessing Andy's body before he becomes trapped in the doll permanently are a bit hard to swallow, just because he was the first person he told his secret to. I don't see why that should be true, but the events are kept moving at a fast enough pace that you really won't care.Child's Play is a very entertaining horror film, with a bit more originality than you might expect. It all builds to a suspenseful climax with Chucky being slowly destroyed before he can possess Andy. It does occasionally lapse into unintentional amusement at the events, but I still believe this is a reasonably diverting motion picture.I love the ironic gag Holland adds at the end, with the final shot of an open door. Symbolising that the door has been left open for many sequels to follow.

It has a tight and well written script with an interesting take on the classic killer doll idea.  For those who have not seen it, I'll give a brief overview of the film.  Charles Lee Ray, a serial killer on the run from the police, is cornered in a toy store.  Before he dies he uses voodoo to transfer his soul into a Good Guy doll.  Good Guy dolls are basically talking Cabbage Patch Kids and the hot toy for that point in time. Andy Barclay desperately wants one for his birthday, but his single mother working at a department store beauty counter (portrayed by Cathrine Hicks of 7th Heaven fame) can't afford one.  It seems luck is on her side when a homeless man is selling one in a back alley.  This is, of course, the doll housing the soul of Charles Lee Ray, or Chucky as his friends call him. Chucky plays the part of a regular doll, only exposing his real self to Andy.  Chucky discovers the only way to regain a human body is to take possession of the body of the first person he told his secret to.  So he must kill Andy and mayhem ensues.  There is no nudity, and very little graphic violence in this movie.  It gets it's R rating mostly from language. But don't let that put you off it's still a very suspenseful and wonderfully engrossing movie, in fact, I'd recommend it for a family movie night (even with young children).

While I can safely say it was better than Friday The 13th I just found myself laughing at this movie more than I was feeling creeped out or scared. Now to be fair I can see where some people were scared by this movie, it's just that it is (either intentionally or not) goofy.The premise is that Charles Lee Ray is a serial killer that one night gets shot by the cops and as he's dying and they're searching he recites a voodoo incantation that transfers his soul into that of a children's toy. The next day a kid named Andy has a birthday coming up and his mother does a very last minute shop for a toy that was recently added to the market that he wants. Then the talking toy that calls himself Chucky and Andy begin to attach immediately and soon the bodies start piling up.Okay first of all I am going to elaborate how I can see people being scared by this. The directing for some of the scenes are actually suspenseful in places, and the argument can be made that when something inanimate is trying to kill a character of course nobody is going to believe them and therefore nobody will help them. So when this movie is looked at from that point of view it's not a bad idea.Okay onto why I think this movie is more goofy than scary. Some of the line deliveries are just hilarious. I mean the way Brad Dourif says Oh god I'm dying as if it's a minor annoyance, then only a nanosecond later he says in the most cartoonishly over-the-top way YOU LISTEN HERE YOU SON OF A BITCH I'M GONNA GET YOU AND I'M GONNA GET EDDIE NO MATTER WHAT! with line deliveries like that and... It's a killer doll among other things I can't help but raise a few chuckles at this movie.Other than that it's pretty much generic slasher. The acting either ranges from overacting to underacting, the killer survives being burnt, decapitated, arm and leg wiped clean off only to then die by getting shot in the heart (Which is a complaint that the scene goes on for too long at least in my opinion). I'd say check it out either for it's goofiness (which doesn't come around often but when it does - it's worth it!) or in some cases the actual suspense.

Back in the late '80s and early '90s, a whole shed load of 'killer toy' movies hit the video shelves &#x96; I'm thinking the likes of PUPPET MASTER, DOLLY DEAREST, et al &#x96; and this is the one that spawned that briefly popular surfeit of miniature killers. However, CHILD'S PLAY is nothing new and indeed what it most recalled to me was the Karen Black segment of the '70s TV horror movie TRILOGY OF TERROR, in which a woman is menaced in her apartment by a voodoo fetish doll. The last twenty minutes of this movie are particularly reminiscent of that one.Anyway, CHILD'S PLAY isn't a bad film, pretty much par for the course for an '80s horror. It's not as cheesy as you might imagine and it showcases an excellent turn from Brad Dourif as both a killer and a killer doll. He's really having a ball here and his enthusiasm is infectious. The rest of the cast don't match him &#x96; heroine Catherine Hicks is adequate but sometimes bland, FRIGHT NIGHT's Chris Sarandon is wooden and child actor Alex Vincent is far too cute &#x96; but it could be worse.My biggest complaint is that the first half of this flick is far too slow. It's a kind of guessing game, leaving us in suspense as to the identity of the killer, wondering whether the kid is responsible after all. The problem is that EVERYBODY &#x96; even people who haven't seen any of these films &#x96; knows that the Chucky doll is indeed the bad guy; it's on the advertising after all! The whole of this mystery guessing-game could have been done away with in favour of more scares. Still, once the film gets going it's not bad, and the string of murders are fairly inventive (the electrocution death is particularly gruesome). I did really enjoy the climax, which reduces things to the classic situation of 'characters trapped and hunted by killer' and manages to be pretty exciting. Props too for the great special effects work, Chucky is indeed a demonic looking toy and quite frightening if you're of a nervous disposition.

The film suffers from the usual shortcomings off most horror fare, for example the fallacy of location Why do they keep throwing the doll down and then get down on all fours so it can attack them easily? Why do they slouch around inside cars while the doll is after them with a knife? Really good horror films solve the fallacy of location in Alien, they're stuck on a spaceship in a vacuum. In Elm Street, the ghoul comes into your dreams; in The Shining, a hotel is snowed in 20 feet deep in the winter; in The Thing, we are stuck on a desolate Antarctic base. In Final Destination, the horror in everyday things that malfunction around you. It's not child's play to do it right, and Chucky fails miserably where all these horror movies succeed.As the killer in Chucky tries to kill the detective who nailed him, and then tries to transfer his spirit to the doll's child owner so as not to become a doll forever, we move from one laughably inane situation to the next. What makes it even weirder is that the special effects are OK. The level of unintentional humor in this movie needed cheesier special effects to work!This movie might get a chuckle from those who saw it as pre-teens in the 80s and feel a bit nostalgic. It might also get a chuckle if you watch it in a Mystery Theater 3000 mood with some friends and brewskis in hand. But I'm afraid it won't do much more. If you want to see some good 80s horror, see The Thing or Nightmare instead. Or Reanimator if you need some cheesy fun. Or The Shining. Or Cronenberg's The Fly. I could think of many more that would be a step up from Child's Play. Only Killer Klowns from Outer Space comes to my mind immediately as definitely more mediocre.

This Is The End, Friend!","Date":"7 November 2015","Score":"","Genre":"Fantasy, Horror","Review":" Child's Play directed by Tom Holland, the film that created the killer doll concept. One night, A serial killer named Charles Lee Ray (Brad Dourif ) is shot to death in a toy store by Officer Mike Norris ( Chris Sarandon ). Before he dies, Charles transfers his soul into a doll using voodoo magic. He is soon bought by Karen Barclay, (Catherine Hicks) a single mother who gives it to her son, Andy (Alex Vincent) who has just turned six. Most people would probably remember Chucky as that wise-cracking, ridiculous slasher villain, but that is not the case in this movie. For the first half of the movie Chucky is not seen walking or talking, but there are killings that are happening. This is quite suspenseful for the first half while Chucky just sits there and only kills by sneak attacks. These killings are blamed on Andy as he happens to be at all the crime scenes.Andy is an alright character. He is likable enough and never becomes too annoying, but he just does not have any personality traits that are interesting. Andy does have this one liner near the end of the film that is just hilarious.Andy's mother (Karen) and the cop Mike Norris are also just okay. They are also not annoying or badly acted, but they also lack any real personality. They play the role of the adults not believing the kid and that's all for the first half. Chucky is the most notable character in the film. The doll special effects are done pretty good, not as good as they were in later films, but not bad. Brad Dourif's Chucky voice is really memorable and really makes the character of Chucky come to life. Now that Chucky is a doll he believes that he is invincible, and so he plans get revenge on the people who have wronged him. With Andy's help getting him there; he goes into his partner's house to kill him because his partner left him for dead. After doing this and Andy is sent to a mental hospital, Chucky goes to see his old voodoo master so that he can find out how to get out of the dolls body. After Chucky voodoo's his teacher into submission, Chucky learns that he will have to transfer himself into Andy's body. That is his goal for the last half of the movie. Although Chucky is a slasher villain, the movie does not follow the slasher formula that was established by Halloween. It is not about a man in a mask stalking people or the body count, but about Chucky's journey as a man, then as a doll, then revenge and finally becoming human again. The body count is not very high, but the kills that they do have are spread out throughout the movie, so it never feels like the film goes to long without a murder or attempted murder. Unfortunately, most of the kills are a little too ridiculous, even for the 80's. A babysitter is killed (familiar?) early on by getting hit by a plastic hammer and she comically reels backwards and JUMPS out a window. Just Silly. These stupid kills are made up for with the scene where Chucky is in the backseat trying to strangle Mike Norris while stabbing though the seat. Mike keeps stepping on the gas and the whole scene just gets intense. The music is a haunting score, especially the opening music. The theme fits the film and makes the still doll seem more sinister then he is. While the score sounds great, it's just not as an iconic or recognizable as the Halloween or Friday The 13th theme. The movie ends with Chucky being set on fire and getting some of his limbs shot off, Chucky is shot in the heart killing him. But what's this? Andy looks back at the served parts of Chucky and sees&#x85;. That he is still there. Ambiguous ending that is not that ambiguous&#x85; Whoa. This might be one of the few slasher films I have seen that did not beg of a sequel. Did not stop them, though. Child's play does have a nice feeling of suspense and the killer is really entertaining to watch. The kills could have been improved, but it does not stop the movie from being enjoyable and at times scary.

One of the film's best features here is the fact that there's just so much done here to make it questionable whether or not he's really possessed or whether the whole thing is in his imagination, a fine product here that carries itself for the whole first half. By focusing so nicely on the these elements, the scenes of the two blatantly disobeying parental instructions in order to follow his directions instead, the constant appearing around the scenes of many of the accidents all innocently and never believing anything he tells them sets this up rather nicely here into her investigation of the whole affair which is where this one really picks up here by letting this here carry the main part of the film. While the revelation sequence is truly legendary here as the earlier investigations give it some intriguing possibilities about what's going on, the battery discovery of all kinds of chilling, the initial reaction is priceless and then the ensuing attack after being threatened makes for a superb, stand-out sequence. Even along these other scenes, there's plenty of other fun to be had here in the film's fun action which are highly enjoyable and make for quite a thrilling time here, from the opening stalking scenes in the toy-store before finally getting to the transfer ceremony as the lightning bolt destroys the store in a giant fireball, a alter stalking scene at the friends' house where he sets the explosive trap that blows up the building and the absolutely fun car chase as another trap inside the car provides some thrills while making a fine set-up for the stalking within the flipped car at the end getting some fine suspense in. As well, there' an absolutely ton of positives to like here with the final stalking in the apartment being the true highlight that features a ton of high-energy action as he charges after them continuously despite being set on fire and having his limbs blown off, the different brawls and overpowering attempts make for quite a nice time and the whole thing comes off flawlessly. Lastly, the film gets an absolute ton of positives from the stellar special effects work for the doll, as this is an absolutely amazing part of the film. Given that this one spends as much time as it does here showcasing him on-screen, it needed to come off flawlessly and he manages to come across as a realistic doll, and the puppets achieving this throughout here are marvelous due to these perfectly conceived creations. These here manage to hold this up incredibly well here as there's not too many flaws here. About the only thing really wrong here is the fact that her investigations take up a lot of time here and somewhat stalls the killing done by keeping the doll off-screen here, though none of this is really boring even detrimental. This one is quite fun regardless.Rated R Graphic Violence, Language, an Attempted Rape and children-in- jeopardy.

Which explains why I didn't get around to the original movie til my mid-30s. And it turns out I completely missed the boat on Child's Play because this movie is far more silly than it is scary. It never gets beyond creepy and that's mainly because of the doll's animatronic face (and Brad Dourif's voice behind it). The character's strength is as a mischief-maker, but that doesn't make up for those stale scenes when he's inert. I felt sad for the little kid more than anything.

This time Holland has directed a film about a doll that gets possessed by the spirit of a notorious murderer. The film tells the story of Karen Barclay (Catherine Hicks) who works hard to buy a doll for her son, Andy. She buys her son a My Buddy doll named Chucky. The doll seems cute until Andy's babysitter (played by Dinah Manoff) is pushed out of a window while watching Andy.

In this movie we get a full, fresh, coherent story because like with many horror movies, the debut could have very well been a stand alone. Andy is a boy who is unlucky enough to get a doll which is possessed by a voodoo serial killer, and Andy is key for the serial killer Charles to transfer his soul out of a lousy doll's body and into a human's again (this actually sums up the Child's Play series). The four main characters we have are Chucky, Andy, Andy's mom, and a detective, and this much is enough to drive the story. Through the film we see the three protagonist characters slowly come to realizations around Chucky, Andy gradually understands that the doll's evil and that he should be combating him rather than complying with him, and the two adults each realize that Andy isn't crazy or imaginative and that his doll is in fact possessed. What's also good about this film is that the audience has reason to believe that Chucky, despite being a doll, is a powerful and capable entity more threatening than even a human. This is a point which will probably become lost on you through the course of the series as his voodoo skills only serve as a method of attempting to transfer his soul in future films.Despite my 6/10 rating (I aim to be objective with my ratings), this movie is a personal favorite of mine (we can attribute that to my teenage fanboy years) and I have watched it multiple times. If a horror movie about a killer doll with a wicked sense of humor sounds appealing to you, then you'll like this movie.

When Andy's babysitter suspects something, Chucky sends her out the window to her death.At one point Chucky tells Andy to take him to an abandoned house outside of town. He exacts revenge on a former colleague and the blame falls on the kid.The trick to the movie is that when Chucky causes chaos, it automatically makes Andy look guilty. No one will believe that Chucky is talking to the boy but eventually Andy's mother that police detective starts to suspect something is up.There are a lot of tense moments in this movie. I especially got a thrill out of a scene, in which Karen is alone at home with the doll, which was reminiscent of the scene with the clown in 'Poltergeist'. She hears something, turns to the living room and sees nothing but the doll on the couch. She turns again hears another noise turns back to the living room and the doll is gone. Some of the scariest moments are always the quiet ones.'Child's Play' has a lot of thrills and a lot of energy. It goes on my list of effective if not brilliant horror films like 'A Nightmare on Elm Street', 'The Relic' and 'Near Dark'.

Chucky is everything Andy wanted, but people start turning up dead, and everyone begins to think if Andy is committing the murders, and nobody realizes Chucky is Charles Lee Ray, wreaking havoc.I enjoy a couple of the sequels, but Chucky began to suffer from Freddy syndrome. Chucky became too popular for his own good, and Chucky started making wisecracks all the time, in lieu of being scary. People keep saying Chucky is back to his creepy ways in Curse of Chucky, but I've yet to see that, so I can't comment on it. If you wanna see Chucky without many wisecracks this movie will satisfy you. Unlike many of the sequels, the jokey tone isn't quite as prominent. Chucky does have one liners, but this is fueled with tension, and it knows how to get under your skin. It has some carefully orchestrated suspense with a slow build to it, which works very well. Don Mancini claims he wanted to wait a bit longer before revealing the doll was killing people, and make people wonder if Andy was crazy. I actually would have dug that, but what they did was awesome as well. It takes about 40 minutes before Chucky reveals who he really is. And let me just say. There is nothing funny about it. If you're a first time viewer, you may find Charles's first real words (I'm discounting the Hi. I'm Chucky. Wanna play?) startling. This movie isn't filled with gore, nor does it need much of it. It relies much more on very effective psychology. When blood does commence, it's fairly nasty. We get a couple of stabbings, gunshot wounds, heads and limbs are shot off, and a little bit more. Gore is not this movie's forte. Alex Vincent is actually quite solid as little Andy. I usually find kids grating at his age, as far as acting goes. Alex thoroughly impressed me with his range at his age. If he had been even slightly annoying, I'm not sure this movie would have been as memorable as it was. Alex is one of the more endearing child actors. I have one request though, sir. Please don't make me breakfast, ever! If the mess he caused is any indication by making his mom breakfast in this movie, he'd burn my place down. I digress. Catherine Hicks is great as Andy's Mom. She's everything you want in a Mother. Vulnerable, strong when it counts, and believable; her relationship with Andy was genuine, and it's easy to root for them. She can be on my side any day. Chris Sarandon plays one of the coolest detectives you'll ever see. I relished every scene he was in. Why isn't this guy recognized more? He's such a great actor. Brad Douriff is legendary, of course. I doubt anyone could do Chucky like he can. I have only one complaint about this movie. The ending felt a bit contrived. It got to be a bit over the top, and it didn't know when to quit. I still enjoyed it, but it felt out of place in this film. Final Thoughts This is the original, and by far the best.

Child's Play is a bit over the top, corny, and silly, but it's one of my favorite horror movies of all time. I wouldn't say the same for the sequels that came after this Tom Holland's movie. The movie met moderate success, when it came out to the point, it became to have a cult following with horror fans. The story is about a boy name Andy Barclay (Alex Vincent) who gets a doll possession by a serial killer/ voodoo practitioner Charles Lee Ray (Brad Dourif). Charles AKA 'Chucky', was killed in a pursued at local toy store by Chicago police man Mike Norris (Chris Sarandon). Before dying, Charles swears revenge on him by transferring his soul by voodoo into a Good-Guy doll. Chucky find himself limited with his new body, and searches for a new body to take over. The catch is that, he has to take the body of the first person he revealed that he was alive to, which happens to be Andy. It's a race against time, as both Andy Barclay's mother, Karen (Catherine Hicks) and Mike Norris try to save Andy, before Chucky get a hold with him. The movie does have some over the top stuff in it. I find the lightning storm hitting the store, in the beginning of the film is be a bit unrealistic. How on earth, did Mike survive that? The deaths scenes were pretty bad like the over dramatic clumsy fall from a woman to the electric shock death of the doctor. How did he get burns on his face? I would had thought they would had test these products before sending it out to be work on patients. The movie has a lot of jump scares that are hit or miss for me. I do think the movie has some really cool scenes that I love. I can't help re-watching the fireplace scene with the iconic words badass phrase 'this is the end, friend'. Probably the best part of the movie. Without spoiling too much about it, it was a pretty good movie at the time. More laughable, than scary. It's a bit laughable now when you think about how outdated the effects are. The movie does a great use of puppets, and little people to make Chucky look like he is coming alive. In one scene, Chucky is play a child with Chucky make up on. How bizarre is that! I just have to complain about how meaningless the plot goes on. The concept of Chucky turning more human, the longer he spent in the doll is meaningless. Even without a head in one scene and badly burn, Chucky is still trying to kill Andy. I don't know any headless human, badly burn people still running around. Plus, it seems like Chucky doesn't understand, pain. Some bullet shots hurt him, while other doesn't. It doesn't make any sense. This concept would had made more sense if they kept the original idea of having Good Guys Dolls have blood and latex skin. The idea of the latex skin, is that if the Dolls get a cut, the kid's parent could go out and buy an Official 'Good Guy band-aid. There was going to be a scene, where Andy makes a Blood-brothers pact with Chucky. Thus, when Andy mixed his blood with Chucky, it cause Chucky to come alive. Last, its takes Chucky forever to capture Andy. This plot device becomes really drawn out in the sequels to the point, it seems like Chucky has no sense of time. The movie has this cohesive story, but its Chucky personality that keeps us interested in the film. A lot of dumb silly puns, and comedy jokes that come out of left field to keep you watching. I can't see, John Lithgrow voicing Chucky as he was the producers original wanted actor to play Chucky. I have to say, Brad Dourif does a great job. Child's Play was pretty original idea at the time. It's rare to see a 'killer doll' movie at the time. The movie could had toyed with the audience a bit more longer making them wonder if Andy was indeed the killer rather than Chucky. Sadly, this was executed badly on the film, by not only the first few minutes of the film, but 2/4 in the film where Chucky in doll form comes alive. By then, the badly needed suspense was gone, and we all are left with a predictive ending. I think a lot of people hate the film to the point that they wanted it banned due to the subject matter of it incite violence to children. First off, yes it does, but to defend the film. Any movies in genre, can incite violence in anybody, if they are truly wanted to. A lot of kid's movies at the time had violent acts on their shows, but you don't see people protesting about them. This movie wasn't made for children with its harsh R rating. Plus, it's clearly shown that bullying is more like to result in violent outburst than watching violence movies. Still, it's pretty dumb for any parent to allow a child to watch a horror movie without first thinking of how it will affect the kid. I think it was pretty dumb for MGM/United Artist to dis owned the film rights due to the subject matter when other United Artist's movies are a bit more violent than this. They lost a lot of money for themselves, as Universal would be pick the film franchise and make millions off of it with its license. Overall, it's a bit dumb, the concept had promise and could had been more believable. Watch it, if you into cheesy 1980's over the top horror flicks.

When I took that film down from the shelf I saw on the front cover a pair of blue eyes looking down on a large building with the title Child's playwritten across the top, I certainly was intrigued so I turned to look at the back. There, in the top right corner, just above the description was a picture of a ginger doll wearing dungarees and a stripey, colorful top. He was standing in the rain waving at me. I have to say, as a child I was pretty shaken, well, I was rather petrified if I'm honest, however this made me want to buy it right there and then. But of course, no parent, never mind grandparent, is going to buy a seven year old a horror film all about a killer doll that becomes conscious, especially when my grandmother herself had a collection of dolls all around her house. So finally, about five years later I caught it on the TV and watched it, and it certainly did live up to my expectations, so much so that I was overjoyed to find out that each of the sequels would be played each week at the same time. I think there are so many factors that contribute to my overgrown love for this franchise and this very film, but I think the biggest factor is Brad Dourif himself. Acting as Charles Lee Ray at the start of the film and voicing the supernaturally possessed doll throughout, Brad Dourif gives an intense, unforgettable performance. His eerie voice delivers the full character, he can go from a playful Chucky that's toying around with a cop to a rather enraged one that's effing and blinding his heart out, no matter what the line is, Brad Dourif can deliver it. Who would I say is the second best cast member? If I'm honest, Alex Vincent, hands down. Despite him being under ten years old when this was being filmed he's still to me the best child actor to star in a horror film to merely be chased by the antagonist. Why do I think this? Because he was a child, who could get into the shoes of another child, and not ruin it along the way. He was believable and you instantly feel some sort of sympathy for him, and no, it isn't because he's being chased by a doll that's been possessed by a murderer, it's because he genuinely gives an emotional performance. About thirty five minutes into the film I found myself frustrated for him when no one believes him that Chucky is real, this is because you can see it in his eyes. You can see that deep down he doesn't want to be in trouble and that he's being tricked, for a child actor to do this is simply astonishing. I've discussed how Chucky as a character is thanks to the voice talents of Brad Dourif, but what about the other 40% of the film before you actually hear Chucky speak and can confirm he is actually alive? How do they keep you on the edge of your seat? Very simple, with two things; simple yet exceptional camera work and top notch animatronics that's very surprising to have been around in 1988. Firstly, I'll discuss just what it is that the camera itself does for you as a viewer. There's a scene around twenty minutes into the film where 'Aunt Maggie' becomes the first character on Chucky's kill list, however, the audience hasn't seen Chucky in full attack mode yet and Don Mancini certainly wanted to keep them waiting. So with a little bit of back and forth from Chucky's eyesight and the eyesight of Aunt Maggie, you see it all without seeing anything at all. The audience is placed into first person view of the doll itself, running around the corners of the room taunting Maggie, however when you think you're safe and inside the monster's mind itself, you switch back to Maggie's viewpoint on it all. With a few jump-scares here and there and the eerie background score completely stopped, you see a Good Guy hammer hit Maggie's head, sending her tripping out of the window to her expected death. This all done with beautifully handled close up angles and first person views. I think this film could have been quite the disaster if a few decisions were to be pointed in a different direction at the time, what I mean by this is imagine if Chucky was created by CGI? We all know judging by films such as Jaws 3 that CGI wasn't exactly the smoothest thing around during the eighties and early nineties, so imagine how disastrous it could have been? But luckily for us, they decided to go fully animatronic (well, excluding a few scenes where you can clearly see a little person was put in a costume). The idea for an animatronic Chucky came from Don Mancini's total shock of how successful it turned out in Gremlins which came out a few years before. To me, the animatronic Chucky was the best way to go, I feel as if I appreciate it more that they put so much time and effort into making it work. In the end I suppose it all comes down to opinion and your taste in movies, some may say this is a total cheese-fest, others may say it's an 80's horror masterpiece, but I suppose I can just say, I'm certainly glad that Pokemon video was missing and this was there in its place, if it wasn't then I probably wouldn't be writing this now.

It wasn't until a little while ago that I saw it for the first time. The many pitfalls of this movie simply do not hold a candle to the shear horror of a living malicious doll, nor the amazing animatronic special fx of this film. It's a great film that stands the test of time for all horror fans.People can complain all they want about the poor child acting, but I'm mesmerized by the mythology of the voodoo that is explored. I always find this religion so mysterious that I can't help but be riveted. I also like the grungy inner city setting of the '80s that seems to be found in other films as well, namely Ghostbusters. It this mixture of mysterious incantations and those dark alleys that we always avoid that help me to get lost in the supernatural and ignore the fact that Prince Humperdink (Chris Sarandon) is now our hero.I heard comment too that the mother (Catherine Hicks) was a little off. She was referenced to her role in Star Trek IV. If anything I thought of her from Seventh Heaven, which helped to make her role in this more twisted, but I thought it was great. My only real complaint would be that it wasn't dark enough. There could have easily been a child murder scene through a playmate that came with the babysitter. The complaints that I hear about acting seem just moot.Certainly today the special effects could be better, but what was done with tricks of the camera helped build the mise-en-scène. Perhaps it was necessity that forced us to see simply a hand light a gas stove, but it really helped to build the nightmare setting. What if doll does come to life? Nobody would believe us, and this is what magnifies the horror.It was a great horror movie &#x96; no doubt, but certainly not in the pantheon of best movies of all time.SPOILERS "},{"Title":"Excellent Jumpy Horror Movie!!

(**** Out Of ****).","Date":"10 December 2012","Score":"","Genre":"Fantasy, Horror","Review":" I am deciding to rewrite my reviews on the Chucky movies because my opinion has changed of them but only a little bit, and since that it is the holiday season I could review something revolving around the Holiday. Yes this movie does count because of a couple of scenes featuring snow. Anyway this film remains to be one of my favorite films of all time and I know it sounds weird but I can explain.The films story follows little Andy Barclay played by Alex Vincent who is celebrating his 6th birthday with his mom Karen Barclay played by Catherine Hicks. However, Andy is disappointed because he did not get the gift he wanted; a Good Guy doll which is the new craze for Andy. Karen feels bad that she could not get the doll because it costs a whopping $100(which is the most expensive doll I have ever seen) and, during work, buys one off a bum in an alley for $35. Later that Night Andy is being babysat by his Aunt Maggie played by Dinah Mannoff who starts hearing strange noises after Andy goes to bed and soon enough Aunt Maggie is killed by falling out of a window. The police possibly target Andy but claims it his Chucky Doll. They think it mighty have something to do with serial killer Charles Lee Ray played by Brad Dourif who was killed by Detective Mike Norris played by Chris Sarandon. The mother realizes that the doll is alive and contains soul of Charles Lee Ray. Chucky voiced by Brad Dourif has to transfer his soul into the first person he revealed his secret to, or else he will be stuck in the doll body forever. The first person he revealed his secret to was Andy.The first thing that I want to praise the story which is original and is very reminiscent of The Talking Tina episode of The Twilight Zone. Also the film wants to make you think Is this all real or just inside little Andys head? Although sequels came along and demolished this thought. Introducing black magic in a horror film was something not done in horror films back then and not very much today so it is interesting to see it here.The next thing are the special effects which are some of the best, if not the best I have ever seen. The doll effects are creepy and when Charles Lee Ray gets transferred into the doll, as the film progresses the doll goes form a squeaky clean look to a dirty, gritty look and I thought that that was very clever. Also (Spoiler) but the effects at the end where Chucky Gets burned alive are great.The next are the performances which are fantastic. Alex Vincent is convincing as the plucky yet frightened Andy, Catherine Hicks is great as the disbelieving mom and of course Chucky would not be what he is today without the terrific voice work of Brad Dourif who takes the little boy cute and safe voice of the good guy doll and turns it into a menacing and dark beast.The final topic is the music and suspense factor. The theme that they use at the end of the film is a bunch of bells and angellic tones. This makes the music very spooky, but what is even creepier is the angellic choir. This makes it haunting and gives me chills every time I listen to it. They were going to use a Chucky theme song but cut it out due to it not being scary enough, and after listening to it I can see why. Thats like putting Eye Of The Tiger in the middle of Saving Private Ryan. The suspense of the film is phenomenal especially the fact that this movie is 87 minutes long and you don't see Chucky come alive until 45 minutes in to the movie. the sequels brought him n quicker but this one wants to toy (no pun intended) with its audience whether it is Chucky committimg these crimes or if it is all inside of little Andys head. The Final Verdict for the 1988 film Child's Play is a 4 Out Of 4 Stars and earns my Seal Of Approval meaning I say go out and not only see but buy this movie. This movie not only has a great and original story but also fantastic special effects, terrific acting and awesome voice work by Brad Dourif, this is a must see.I also like the suspense how you do not see the doll come alive until 45 minutes into the film.

"}{"Title":"Chucky is another slasher icon","Date":"15 January 2007","Score":"","Genre":"Fantasy, Horror","Review":" Child's Play is one of those horror movies where you expect a hilarious villain and bad actors dealing with him. It's a comedy-horror, but it cannot be defined as B-Horror since you could smell the movie's ambitions from a hundred miles. It could hardly be considered typical 80s horror movie. The whole atmosphere is some kind of a experimental transfer into the early 90s.The story centers on a child called Andy who wants a doll that is pretty popular in the society, the character live in. The only problem is that Andy is not familiar with the fact that the doll is alive and something much worse - it's evil.Before viewing Child's Play, I had seen bits of pieces from Bride of Chucky. That was my only connection with the series. As for my expectations - I wouldn't call them high. After all, this is a movie about a little doll that stalks and kills naive, badly developed characters incapable of dealing with any kind of danger. Child's Play turned out to be a positive surprise and the weirdest thing is that all characters are indeed brainless and uninteresting. The acting is average at best and the dialog is more than ridiculous. But who cares about dialog when a funny, small toy curses and uses knives with the mission of killing an annoying child. The movie's best plus is its simplicity. The only thing you are supposed to enjoy is Chucky and his ability to kill. You don't see a living doll every day. Since the movie is full of clichés, average horror fan should be prepared for usual stuff like bad ending or as I mentioned above - characters with low I.Q.Child's Play doesn't include gore. Something that is out of big importance since those who have not seen it, might suggest the movie follows the typical formula. Not at all. Really disappointing, but it makes sense. After all, the main character is a kid and I can't imagine tones of blood covering up the screen. I've noticed one thing about comedy-horror movies. They are either funnier or gorier. Child's Play deducts to the first group. Analyzing the quality of humor is a very stupid thing to do. Chucky's franchise has been famous for 20 years, mainly because of Chucky's humorous lines rather than impressive storytelling. Other than that, nothing about Child's Play could be considered hilarious. If you read a description like the following Child's Play is a hilarious horror movie, stay away from the person who has written it.Tom Holland's directing is beyond average, but it can't be compared to his achievement in Fright Night.Overall - memorable flick that started a successful series. Every self-respecting horror fan should watch it and appreciate it for what it has brought to the genre. Of course it's not perfect, but very few horror movies date as good as Child's Play does. "},{"Title":"One Of The Most Original Horror Films Of The Late '80s.","Date":"6 January 2007","Score":"","Genre":"Fantasy, Horror","Review":" Child's Play has become somewhat of a horror classic over the years, and has gained more and more popularity (probably due to the large number of sequels). The movie is about a single mother, Karen (Catherine Hicks, most popular for her long-running role on the television series 7th Heaven), who has a young son named Andy (Alex Vincent). Andy's birthday is coming up, and he wants a Good Guy doll - an interactive, talking doll that is really popular at the time. Karen is short on money and is working at a department store, but manages to get one of the dolls from a peddler on the streets. Little does she know, the doll has been possessed by the spirit of a recently-killed serial killer, Charles Lee Ray (voiced by Brad Dourif). Soon after Andy has the doll, people who come near it begin to die mysteriously, and Andy says he sees his doll, whom he's named Chucky, come to life. His mother doesn't believe him, but soon enough she will...Probably one of the most original horror movies of the late '80s, Child's Play is a unique and well-done horror/thriller that is very fun to view. Unlike most slasher films, the villain in this movie is in the form of a possessed doll - and a creepy looking little doll at that. A wise choice by director Tom Holland, the audience never really gets to see Chucky completely in motion for the majority of the film. We mainly see things from the doll's point of view, which is a lot more effective and much creepier than seeing an animatronic doll running around killing people. As the film progresses though, we do see more of Chucky in motion (talking, moving, etc.), but for a good amount of time leading up to that, we see him in his lifeless form, as everyone else seems to see him. And I think his presence is much better because of that.I liked the cast in the film. Nobody performed badly, and Catherine Hicks is a really likable actress. I haven't seen her in much, but she's a good actress and her characters are always very likable (from what I've seen, anyway). Alex Vincent, the young performer playing Andy isn't bad either, and Brad Dourif provides an appropriate voice for the murdering doll. As I've said before, I don't like dolls and I never have. They've always kind of weirded me out. In fact, when I was a young kid (maybe six or seven years old), my mom worked at a video store and the owners of the store received a little promotional Chucky doll when they got Child's Play in, and they displayed it behind a glass window in the office with suction cups. And boy, I remember being literally terrified of that thing! It wasn't until later on when I was older that I finally saw this movie, but that little doll was one of my distinct childhood fears.Bottom line - Child's Play is a really good horror movie with an original plot and some good camera-work (plus a few very creepy moments). Horror fans will definitely want to check this movie out - even though the premise can be looked at as laughable, it's still a very good little scary movie. If you like this film, you may also want to check out Dolls, which was made a few years before this, and is also a very spooky killer-doll movie. 8/10.

That said, the original Child's Play is a terrific film from which the sequels take their basis - a doll possessed by the spirit of a serial killer trying to get back to life by transferring his soul into a new body, and in this case, the body of a young boy, Andy Barclay (Alex Vincent). The troubles begin after Andy has been given the doll, and his babysitter, Maggie seemingly falls to her doom from the high-level apartment window. Of course, no one believes Andy when he tells them that it was Chucky, and it is only when it is mentioned Chucky is really Charles Lee Ray, that Detective Mike Norris (Chris Sarandon) begins to believe what is going on. Of course Andy's mother, Karen Barclay (played by the fabulous Catherine Hicks) doesn't believe her son at first, until she discovers that Chucky is moving without batteries.However, while the film is very fun, it is also lacking. While the interaction between Sarandon and Hicks is terrific, it would have been nice to see more of a romantic twist to their relationship. There is also a serious lack of supporting characters - the only one of real note is Maggie, but she is killed off in the first half hour, which is a shame, because she is played by Dinah Manoff - a.k.a. Marty from Grease. Dinah was spectacular, it is a shame her film career never really went anywhere. Of course, Brad Douriff appears as Charles Lee Ray, and then does the voice of Chucky.While a great film overall, it is easy to see why the franchise has gained so much popularity from the sequels.

Detective Mike Norris chases him into a toy store in the wee hours of the morning. Norris shoots Ray a few times and he is dying. He lumbers around the toy store and knocks over a bunch of dolls. He takes one out of the box and uses a voodoo spell to transfer his soul into the doll. Norris thinks he killed him and everything is now a OK, right? WRONG! Young Andy Barcely wants a Good Guy doll, and his mother buys one from a peddler behind her work place. Everything now goes to hell because of course, the doll she buys is Chucky. Aunt Maggie is killed, and soon after Eddie Caputo, Chucky's partner in crime, is killed too.You don't see Chucky come alive until about 45 minutes into the movie. This doesn't take anything away from it though, as the suspense builds nicely throughout. At first, it seems as if Andy is the killer. Chucky later finds out that he must transfer his soul into the first human being he revealed himself too. Chucky now tries to get into Andy, using the voodoo incantation.Well as you can guess, Chucky's plan is foiled, thanks to Detective Norris, Andy's mom, and Andy himself. Chucky is burned, then has his head shot off, then is shot in the heart, finally killing him. Or so we think...All in all, Child's Play came out at the right time. Any earlier and it would have been ignored. Any later and it would have been called cheesy and too 80's. It's a great film if you like horror movies, but don't go expecting a huge body count and tons of nudity.

It is the kind of film where you can sit there and yell at the screen telling the actors what they need to do and what they don't need to do.The film is about young Andy, who has just got a 'Good Guy' doll for his birthday. But what he doesn't know, is that his doll is possessed by the soul of a crazy serial killer, and the only way this serial killer can turn back into a human is for him to possess this little boy. So now, his mom and Detective Norris must find a way to kill this doll.The kid who played Andy did an excellent job in this film, especially for someone so young. Of course Chris Sarandon does a good job, just like he does in everything he is in. I forget the name of the woman who played Andy's mom, but she did a very good job as well. Anybody who enjoys old cheesy 80's horror flicks will enjoy CHILD'S PLAY!

That's it. With a premise like that created by your horror movie instinct, you watch the movie with low expectations, or in the worst case, you don't even watch it. That has happened to MANY horror movies from the 80's thanks to clichés started by the slasher genre.Child's Play has the advantage of being a good horror movie and overpasses expectations. If you think Child's Play is a cheesy, silly, slasher flick you will be pleasantly wronged. Sit down, relax, and watch it with NO expectations and you will have a good time.*SPOILERS*Charles Lee Ray a dangerous strangler from the area is killed in a Toys 'r Us store by Detective Mike Norris after a long chase. Moments before dying, Lee Ray speaks a demonic spell and passes his soul to a Good Guy doll and swears revenge against the Detective and his accomplice in crimes Eddie Caputo. Mrs. Barclay buys the doll for her 6 (?) year old son Andy but little does she knows that the doll is possessed. The doll answers to the name of Chucky (name created by Lee Ray)...and you know the rest.Child's Play has a near to brilliance script if you watch it objectively. I praise Mancini's and Holland's intention to hint the audience about Andy being a possible suspect of the murders. The suspense in this movie is very effective and Holland's direction is top notch. The script is very complete as it deals with a possessed doll doing the killings, black magic, voodoo, police in the hunt of a strangler, and the disbelief of everyone towards the possessed doll.There are many elements that make Child's Play a GOOD horror movie. First, the story is very well crafted and the characters well written. Second, there's not that much cheesiness (a killer doll is cheesiness) and the movie is always interesting. Third, the good acting is a key element. Chris Sarandon (Mike Norris) is a great actor and his performance in this movie credits him. Tom Holland cast Sarandon mainly because of his great performance in Fright Night. Sarandon has can act in horror movies. Catherine Hicks is good as the worried mother that would do anything to protect her young son. Very good performance. Alex Vincent (Andy Barclay) steals the movie with his tender and believable performance. He looks shocked whenever Chucky does the bad things or threatens him. His probably the most liked child actor in the 80's horror movies. Great performance.Brad Dourif gave the voice to Chucky and he totally shined. He gave a wicked performance and you can't think of Chucky without thinking about Dourif. It helps a lot that Dourif has portrayed weird characters like Chucky.Child's Play has a great cast, good direction, good f/x and make-up (very good for it's time), a decent score, and a high fun factor.This is by no means a GREAT, or BRILLIANT horror movie but it's sure a good one. It's entertaining and wicked on it's own way. One of the best horror movies from the 80's and that's something to say.8/10. Worths a watch.

Perhaps, but this is still a quality horror movie. There are some good, tense moments; a decent execution of the voodoo angle; believable performances by all involved; a campy but fun story line; and a satisfying, if somewhat smarmy, ending.The transformation sequence, if not original, did have a creative spin and a unique execution. This was a classic B horror, directed by Tom Holland, which was so bad, it was good. I never figured out how Chucky could reach doorknobs, light switches, and elevator buttons, though. Just a bit of creative licensing, I suppose, but it contributed a heavy feeling of camp throughout this fun little cheese-fest. Honestly, I like this movie for its cast.In spite of its shortcomings, I highly enjoy watching this movie, and the subsequent sequels. I guess this is one of My guilty pleasures. *LOL* On a more serious note, I must comment on the detriment of our society, in that a child must rely on a doll for his/her only companionship, rather than the company of his/her mother or other human contact.

Unknown to, this doll contains the spirit of Charles Lee Ray (Brad Dourif), the notorious Lakeshore strangler, who after being mortally wounded in a shoot out with police office Mike Norris (Chris Sarandon) passed his soul into the doll so that he could continue living. However Charles (nicknamed Chucky) does not want to be a doll forever which is very bad news for Andy.The movie is a little slow but, considering the rather daft subject and plotline, manages to be rather tense in places and delivers a couple of shocks. Created by Tom Holland, who previously brought us &#145;Fright Night' and wrote &#145;Psycho II', &#145;Child's Play' is the film that started the rather brief influx of killer toy movies (&#145;Puppet Master' being the only other that was really any good) and through it's rather poor sequels helped to end the same fad. This original isn't all bad but becomes rather tedious after numerous watches. There are only so many times you can watch the same movie about the same killer doll without the absurdity of the situation beginning to bother you. However, for horror fans that have not already seen this movie, it is worth checking out. The acting is quite accomplished for an Eighties horror movie, and the story itself is not actually that bad. Questions are left, but the idea is simple though tries to be too complex in parts and that subtracts from the enjoyment of the movie. It's astonishing that Chucky has become such a cult icon since the making of this film and it is worth watching this movie just to see if you can guess why? The foul-mouthed little murderer is in some ways kind of loveable and his occasional one-line jokes in this film do offer an enjoyable source of comic relief. Unlike it's sequels, especially &#145;Bride of Chucky' (1998), &#145;Child's Play' is generally a more `serious' horror film, lacking much gore despite a few grisly scenes, the movie tries to rely more on suspense and tension but it's attempts often lead to rather dull and uneventful moments. Tom Holland did direct this movie well, a number of scenes stay in the mind after viewing including the final moments which are some of the more exciting scenes in horror for films of the late Eighties, but occasionally Holland's judgement seemed to slip and the viewer is left with overly repetitive and eventually dull moments.Not to everyone's liking but probably for fans of 1980's horror cheese, even if the movie does try to be too serious in places, I enjoy this movie though it does not stand up to repeated viewing. If not for the dull moments I probably would hold the movie in higher regard.

Don't get me wrong, this is a great movie, but my point is, no little kid should watch this movie. Being the same age as the main character (and sharing the same first name), I was mortified. I pretty much avoided it through most of my childhood until I got a little older and got over it. Now, I love this movie. To me, it is a classic slasher flick, right up there with Halloween and Nightmare on Elm Street. Chucky is one of the most memorable horror movie icons to come along in the past 20 years. Although he didn't really come into his own here (see Child's Play 2) he had plenty of great one-liners, my favorite being in the elevator scene. The movie itself is pretty dark. It takes place in Chicago and the environment created is a very grimey and seedy setting where corruption and crime rules the street. Brad Dourif plays the part of Charles Lee Ray (Chucky), the infamous Lake-shore Strangler, who after a struggle with the police, loses his life and transfers his soul into one of the popular good guy dolls. As coincidence would have it, little Andy (played by Alex Vincent, who has very little movie experience outside of this film and quit the business a decade ago) wants nothing more than to have his very own Good Guy doll. Put two and two together, let your imagination roll, and you know what will happen. The movie is pretty freaky because you are constantly questioning everything you know. For the first hour, you don't see Chucky move or speak, so you might be suspicious that Andy is causing all this mayhem. I won't spoil the movie for you. It's one of those horror flicks that I consider to be required viewing. It is both entertaining and scary. It may look a little dated, but it has definetly stood the test of time.

Only the doll's young owner knows what's going on, but no one believes him. You have to give director Tom Holland credit for taking on such a wacky storyline; there are so many ways it could have failed. Has he succeeded, despite the odds? The answer is yes, for the most part Child's Play works. It's a slick, fast-paced horror/dark fantasy that builds up excitement until the relentless finale. It's a tour-de-force sequence that just doesn't let up. The horror convention of the killer who won't die has been used so often it's become a cliché, but it's effectively utilized here. I am remind of James Cameron's Terminator, which featured similar scenes, although that film did so in a much more serious manner.Note the extensive use of point-of-view shots in the early scenes. There is no doubt that part of their existence is due to the inherent technical challenges of creating a convincing killer doll effect in the pre-CGI era. However, they also serve to create a degree of ambiguity regarding the true identity of the killer. Is that little boy responsible, and making up stories about Chucky? At this point everyone knows the doll is solely to blame for any deaths that occur in this film, but it's still fun to watch everything unfold, to observe the little bits where characters slowly come to suspect the truth. When we finally do get to see the doll in action, the special effects work is nearly flawless, thanks to the tireless efforts of makeup guru Kevin Yagher. Sometimes his work in this film is so convincing it's downright eerie.Alex Vincent is one of the few child actors who is not whiny or overwrought; he takes on the role believably and helps to make everything more credible. Likewise, Catherine Hicks is effective as his frightened mother, and Chris Sarandon takes a no-nonsense approach to his role as a disbelieving cop. Of course, the real star is Brad Dourif, that reliable player of weird characters in genre films. His odd voice is perfectly suited for what must be his strangest role yet. In fact, this movie might not have worked without the benefit of the right performers to give the material some grounding in reality. In the end, the only element of the film that doesn't quite work is the subplot about Chucky's use of voodoo rituals. Granted, this aspect of Child's Play is not treated as stereotypically as many other films have done; there is a degree of ambiguity surrounding the nature of that particular religion. Nonetheless, whenever it's dealt with, it seems somewhat strained. However, it's not dwelled upon for too long. This is a much better film than you'd normally have the right to expect.*** (out of ****)Released by United Artists  "},{"Title":"Sleeper chiller (minor spoilers)","Date":"12 September 2002","Score":"","Genre":"Fantasy, Horror","Review":"  Definitely one of the ten best horror/splatter flicks of the 80s!

Chucky just limps and they see it as a normal lil' doll that the kids left on the ground for them to pick up, pass by, and Chucky can resume him murderous activities. The perfect crime. Also, Who would suspect the doll?      Chucky has a haunting voice (Thanks to Brad Dourif) Which goes well with the lil' doll character. But, you don't hear him talk much. Andy (The Little Boy) Just puts him up to his ear and then does something. He should of talked more. But, In the Sequels, he should have talked LESS. In this one, (Like Nightmare on Elm Street), He is scary. You don't see him much, he doesn't talk THAT much, only when needed, and when he kills someone, It's chilling! And (Also Like Nightmare on Elm Street) In the sequels he's on screen too much, talks ALOT, and you get used to him on screen and start to laugh at him, SO he IS NOT SCARY ANYMORE.

I won't hear serious criticism of any of them as they defy such literate analysis. Any Chucky film is a cinematic event - live with it! If you want to complain - go watch THE ENGLISH PATIENT instead...now that truly IS a horror film!CHILD'S PLAY was pretty original for its day and drew its fair share of criticism from audiences worldwide who complained about what they saw as extreme violence and children being exposed to evil doings! Yeah well, the hanging scene in OLIVER was pretty ropable (sorry, just HAD to say it!) too!  As I have said many times if some enterprising person put out a Chucky doll in the world's department stores - they would sell millions! I wish I had the venture capital!Fans will realise that CHILD'S PLAY was directed by Tom Holland who also made the innovative and brilliant FRIGHT NIGHT which also starred Chris Sarandon (Susan's bro! if you didn't already know), Brad Dourif contributes another masterful supporting  performance as the evil Charles Lee Ray who becomes Chucky of course.Nowhere does this film lag - a trait of Tom Holland.

Andy sees a doll he wants for his birthday that his mother can hardly afford. One night the mother buys the doll from a homeless man for cheaper. Then the other part of the story links up to the detective (played by the brilliant Chris Sarandon) who shot the serial killer Chucky (as a human). When the detective kills Chucky his soul enters the doll and the irony is that Andy ends up with the doll. Chucky (the killer doll) is then o a murderous mission to seek vengance on the cop who killed him,and to take over Andys soul and become human again before it's too late.

When everyone was used to see a psycho or some creature doing the murders in a movie, someone came with the idea of a doll committing the crimes. Sounds little original, but what makes it a good idea is the fact that the doll has a kick-ass personality, and we get to love the character. Chucky is the villian in this movie. Don't laugh about his short height, or  his clothes, or about his horrible hair... 'cause he can be a mean doll.Child's Play has gore, an interesting plot, voodoo elements, a great direction, an effective score,  and good actors.

Charles Lee Ray is badly injured, and performs a voodoo ritual on a 'good guy doll' so that he may 'live' inside it! All this transpires just before he gets struck by a bolt of lightning. The cops think him dead, but Charles Lee Ray will still exact his murdering potential on anyone he feels gets in his way.The story then deals with a young boy's birthday present - which just happens to be - OH NO!!! - Charles' Good Guy doll!!! His name for the doll is 'Chucky'. Watch the Rugrats cartoon series, and there's a FRIGHTENING similarity between the two!!!The film rolls along at a good pace, building up the suspense well. People are murdered and the one connection to all the murders? Little Andy. Surely he isn't the killer? But as an audience we know who it is!Chucky is both cute/funny and terrifying.

Here for once is a slasher film that doesn't go over-the-top to be gross and disgusting (the sequels however took that route). That makes it all the more better. Child's Play relies on scares and shocks instead of gore galore and on that basis, it works. I remember jumping from out of my seat on a couple of occasions when I saw this in a movie theater when it first came out. Catherine Hicks stars as Karen Barclay, a divorced mother living in Chicago with her cute 6-year-old son Andy. The upside on Andy's birthday she buys him a Good Guy doll (one of those talking dolls). The downside this is no ordinary doll. This is a doll that's possessed with the mind of a madman who transferred his soul into the doll before dying from gunshot wounds. Before you know it, the doll (named Chucky) starts killing people off, and it's up to Karen and police detective Mike Norris (Chris Sarandon) to stop the terror from continuing. Child's Play is a bit preposterous in some scenes, but it's so entertaining that I was involved with what was going on. It's scary, and thrilling. It has good special effects on when the doll comes to life. And it has terrific acting. Hicks and Sarandon are well cast, as is young Alex Vincent as Andy. This kid is not only cute, but is a pretty good actor. I would only see this youngster in one more movie (Child's Play 2), and that was it. I haven't seen him in another movie since. Brad Dourif (One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest) appears briefly as the killer who works up some voodoo magic to get the movie moving in motion, and Dinah Manoff (Empty Nest) provides a little comic relief as Hicks' best friend. Good directing job by Tom Holland (Fright Night), who keeps the movie moving at a fast pace. I was never bored while watching it. Plus, it has one of the eeriest music scores that I've ever heard for a horror movie. Child's Play is ridiculous to be sure, but so what.

Cue catchphrase Hi, I'm Chucky, wanna play...?   One thing that the makers of the later Nightmare on Elm Street sequels could learn by watching this is why the comedy element of this film works.  Asking us to take a killer doll completely seriously was always going to be a stretch, so they threw in a little (dark) comedy.  Freddy Krueger is a character we should be able to take seriously, because of the child abuse that forms part of the mythology of his character.  What works for one film is a huge misfire in the other (see my ANOES 4 review for more details)   Holland is helped in his mission to transform a silly plot into a genuinely disturbing horror thriller by a nice cast (why has Chris Sarandon sunk into obscurity?)  Particularly good are Sarandon as the cop, Dinah Manoff as the single mum's best friend, and of course, Dourif as Charles Lee Ray/The Voice of Chucky.(SPOILERS)   An atmospheric opening sequence helps set the tone, and the first viewing is especially good because you're never quite sure how Chucky will choose to present himself.  The scene where he makes himself known to Andy's mum must surely enter the ranks of the horror classics...   STANDOUT SCENE Where Chucky goes to visit his old voodoo-practising pal  I gotta go, John, I got a date with a six year-old kid, and YOU have a date with death...

I was pleasantly surprised. It was not as cheesy as I thought it would be, although the first action scene in the movie, involving Charles Lee Ray being chased into a toy store and then creating a storm as he transferred his dying body into a Good Guys doll, was terrible. It was more suspenseful than I thought. There were some scenes which were very pleasantly surprising. The boy did a very decent job as an actor, and the three leads, Catharine Hicks, Chris Sarandon, and Brad Douriff were good. The story and dialogue was good, and the animatronics for Chucky were very, very impressive. The first time you see the movie it's great. But after you see it once, it gets VERY boring. The second time you see it, all you want is Chucky, yet he is not in the movie until a full hour, and the movie is only 88 minutes long. Chucky's absence from the screen is for such a long time that the movie really drags. The first time you see it, the fact that you don't see him walk and talk 'till the final reel is very sophisticated, but a movie like this one, a HORROR movie, can't really do that because people want to watch that kind of movie because of the excitement and the chills and thrills. The three sequels I thought were much less sophisticated and much more silly, but at least they are fun to watch more than once.

He is one of the greatest in putting humor in horror. This was first recognized with his masterpiece, FRIGHT NIGHT.

An annoyance that goes deeper than the fact I wanna slap the stupid looking doll. IDK maybe it's because I've never liked playing with baby dolls as a kid I found them to be annoying too (and I'm a female).

It took me years but finally I started with it. What took me so long? Well, because Chucky used to freak me out as a little kid when I saw ads for it on TV! But no, of course it's far from a true scary movie really. The one thing that this movie has going for it is its originality but in all truth and honesty, that's more than enough for a movie of this sort.Having a child-sized doll as your killer is obviously a quite unique and original premise. And it actually works well. Having a doll as the killer prevents this movie from falling into the usual genre clichés and makes the movie more original than not with all of its horror/slasher moments. Besides, the effects for Chucky are all convincing looking, so it actually looks like it's a real doll going berserk and goes on a killing spree, after a serial killer transfered his soul into the doll, right before he died. Not hard to see why he has become an horror icon over the years.And of course who better to play a maniac killer than Brad Dourif. Granted that he only is in the movie for a couple of minutes but he also provided the voice for the Chucky doll, or good boy doll, like he's officially called. The Child's Play series actually gave him lots of fame, even though he's only providing the voice of Chucky in the rest of the series.I would had probably still preferred it if the movie went along with its original idea of letting you in doubt whether or not the Chucky actually truly came to life or if perhaps it was the little kid who committed all of the murders. It would had given the movie an extra dimension, horror-wise but the went for the more straight-forward and perhaps also more safe road instead. Yes, it makes the movie quite simplistic but luckily it still of course has its originality going for it, which really makes this movie an above average genre attempt.I think that the movie works better as entertainment than horror really but I don't necessarily see this as a bad thing. It means that you can have fun watching this movie but you're better off watching a different one if you're in the mood for a good scary- or gory slasher.It still remains one of the more original movies within its genre.7/10 http//bobafett1138.blogspot.com/ "},{"Title":"A goofy, but well made horror","Date":"21 August 2010","Score":"","Genre":"Fantasy, Horror","Review":" At first I found the movie to be a bit weird for my liking. Some serial killer is being chased into a toy store, get's corned and shot by the police, then chants some mystical voodoo spell to transport his soul into a Good Guy Doll, doesn't sound very invigorating. However despite the questionable premise I found 'Chucky' to be an effectively intimidating and scary horror flick, and I think that it's mainly due to Tom Holland's clever direction.What he does is, he takes his time putting us behind dark room corners and point-of-view camera shots before actually letting us see the doll move freely about, kind of like what Steven Spielberg did with Jaws. This allows Tom to build up plenty of suspense just before he encapsulates us with the impressive visual effects. In that scene where the mother threatens to throw Chucky into the fire, Charles Lee Ray comes to life right before your eyes and it's so much fun to watch. Even before the doll expressed his true self he was still very intimidating, every time you looked at him you could tell that there was something going on in that little plastic head. Brad Dourif was casted perfectly for this role, he has such a creepy voice that it's not surprising why the producers wanted him to stick around for next five sequels. And that kid who played the little boy Andy was a very good actor, especially for only being seven years old.Child's Play does not have the best story, nor the best screenplay, but it does have a great main monster, great visual effects, and a great director that all together prevents the movie from being a complete waste of time.

It is edited by the way.Child's Play as well as being my favorite horror film is also my 2# favorite film of all time, along side with The Dark Crystal. It has everything a film can possibly have. As my summary goes it tells the story of how great I find this film.The story is quite simple but also very different from other Horror films that have come before and after it.It is about a serial killer/lake shore strangler called Charles Lee Ray (Brad Dourif) who is trying to escape a detective named Mike Norris (Chris Sarandon) a long with a couple of cops who are also trying to get Ray's friend Eddie Caputo. The Serial Killer isn't ready to die and he breaks into a toy store, transferring his soul into an innocent good guy doll named Chucky. The next morning a hard working mother named Karen Barclay (Catherine Hicks) skips off of work and buys the doll from some peddler who grabbed the possed doll from the toy store. She gives it to her son Andy (Alex Vincent) for his 6th birthday and Andy is loving his new toy. When Karen is asked to do overtime, her friend Maggie baby sits Andy. She puts him to bed and is then killed by Chucky cause she turned off the news. After that Chucky goes on a killing spree to posses Andy's soul so he can live again. If he doesn't, he's stuck in the sinister doll forever.After summarizing such an amazing plot, I have really grown to love the characters, the locations, the effects, everything. I'm going to go through more of the film and make my pointers a little bit deeper for why it's my favorite Horror Film.Plot/Story, 10/10 The Story is planned well and the characters as well as the scenes keep the story alive throughout. The story is at a slow pace and if you hate slow paced stories, then this isn't for you. But like other slow paced horror stories such as Black Christmas, this one does it perfectly. I found nothing wrong with the story.Acting, 9/10 The actors acting out were all done well. Alex Vincet for being only 6 or 7 years old at the time just did so well, it's like he had to have the responsibility for keeping everything alive. Brad Dourif was a perfect voice for the serial killing Chucky. He did great as Charles Lee Ray as he had to be a mad man running all over the place. Catherine Hicks & Chris Sarandon also do well. These 4 actors keep the film stable and the other actors no doubt were excellent.Effects, 9/10 There isn't much to say about the excellent effects that haven't been said already. For the late 80's, they do a top notch job at the sinister Chucky. The way they made him move, walk, sprint, kill and even jump were all done well.Scenes, 10/10 A lot of people think that some of the scenes were silly, silly maybe but the silly scene with the voodoo joint was done well. Every scene that came around was always very memorable whether Chucky was on-screen, off-screen or his perspective, it didn't matter. The scenes were always pulled off well and some of them actually scared me the first time round.I also wanted to point my point out a little bit deeper for why this is the best Horror film. Besides it having many memorable moments, this Slasher as well as Horror had a whole new tone and level which made it much better for a change. Now don't get me wrong I love Michael Myers, Freddy Krueger, etc but I think it's better when we see something else. i'm not talking about a Killer in a mask etc going after teens. I'm talking about a Doll stopping at nothing to get what he wants. And that why I found Child's Play a bit better then Halloween etc, because It was something different.I want to conclude that if you haven't seen this Slasher/Horror film yet, you must at once. It's also the first Horror film i own and I'm really glad that it's the first one cause it's just the best.One of the most memorable films. 10/10 "},{"Title":"Child's play is kinda underrated","Date":"3 April 2010","Score":"","Genre":"Fantasy, Horror","Review":" I can't believe this film has a 6.2 on the ratings, it should be at least 7.2.

Charles uses voodoo to transfer his soul into a good guy doll, which is from there on out The Lake Shore Strangler is now Chucky the killer doll. If your a horror fan that gets bored with horror films that barley has gore then you might not like this film, It does how ever surpasses John Carpenter's Halloween in gore though, but much like Halloween, this film doesn't need gore to be entertaining or scary. When someone says Chucky, you might think of a goofy evil doll that's real jokey but this one Chucky is real bad ass, scary and serious. Even Child's Play 2, Chucky was a real joker. Alex Vincent as Andy Barclay does a pretty good job for his age. You'll be surprised that Andy is far from annoying unlike Tyler from Child's Play 3. I thought Chucky looked a lot more realistic in this one then in the sequels, He looks like a demonic toddler!! Just look at him, when he's trying to transfer his soul into Andy. The Characters that were being killed off could have been in there longer, to make it seem more like a slasher, Maggie was in there for a pretty good time but the rest of the people that Chucky kills need to be in there a little bit longer, Leprechaun 1 also suffers from this But at least this one did it a little bit better. Brad's voice is perfect for Chucky's voice, It was actually a girl who did Chucky's voice but they watched the scenes where Chucky talks and they thought Chucky sounded like he was gay. Brad was supposed to only play Charles Lee Ray but fortunately they also casted him to do Chucky's actual voice. Any Ways this is the best out of the series, check it out.

A doll that can interact with you, the Good Guy is all the rage but unfortunately Andy's working single mother can't afford one, that is, until a street peddler is willing to sell her one on the cheap. Quickly making friends with his doll, named Chucky, Andy gets more than he bargained for when heinous murders resembling that of the recently deceased Lakeshore Strangler start springing up and he gets the blame. Is Andy crazy? Has Chucky sprung back to life? And just what the heck is up with the street peddler's teeth? Child's Play, directed by Tom Holland (Fright Night) and written by Don Mancini (who has written every installment in the franchise to date) dances around these issues, brilliantly keeping you in suspense for the bulk of the film. While the popularity of the following sequels and its iconic killer spills the beans, the film still manages to retain a fair amount of creepiness. If you managed to catch this film as a child, it no doubt scared the bejesus out of you, and even as a grown up, it will hook you in with its sinister mood, chilling music and sympathetic performances by Alex Vicnent as Andy and Catherine Hicks as his mother. Key performances by genre hero Chris Sarandon as the skeptical cop on the trail of the murders and the great Brad Dourif as Chucky only further rope you in.Even though it is over 20 years old and some aspects of the film have become understandably dated, the film still retains the kind of magic that only the best horror films have. Its sequels may have made a joke out of the initial premise, but as a stand-alone film, Child's Play is as effective as they come. A remake is currently in the works (with Mancini and Dourif returning) that plans to return the franchise to its darker roots, but the sequels themselves were fun, just on a completely different level. Try to forget everything you know when viewing this movie, and it will reward you each and every time.

There really isn't anything scary about a doll. I think the idea of a doll coming to life and killing people is actually pretty damn humorous. It wouldn't be that hard to just pick it up by it's legs and smash it! Sheesh! That being said, this is what I think of CHILD'S PLAY.The first half of this film is solid. The film starts out with a little boy being really excited about his upcoming birthday in which he's going to get a 'My Buddy' doll, which is apparently the next big toy craze in the world of young children. His mom buys his doll from a rather sketchy homeless man in a trench coat and, sure enough, people soon start dying. The first half of the film works perfectly by not giving away the identity of the killer and in leading the audience with some question as to who is committing the murders. It actually works incredibly effectively. The performances are remarkably realistic and the suspense feels genuine. The mother and the child are equally likable and you really get a true feeling of dread from several of the scenes.Unfortunately, the doll comes to life. Once he does, the film changes. It goes from being a legitimately suspenseful and bizarre horror film to being a rather tasteless and by-the-numbers slasher flick. The doll goes on a murder spree, and, instead of feeling tension, we witness people getting killed by a doll. The murder scenes often come off cheap, forced, and pointless. The tone of the film shifts to a series of clichés. Pretty soon, the whole thing feels like such a joke that after a while you just stop caring and just go with it and accept what is going on, although it really doesn't make it any better. I never really felt that there was any reason for any of the characters to be scared of a doll, despite the fact that the doll goes on a killing spree. I found the second half of the film a bit silly and contrived.Despite the weak second half, the film is still worth seeing. I just wish that they could have taken the original premise with the film further rather than to have turned the whole film into a slasher picture. While I do not generally mind a good slasher picture, this film kinda leads you to believe that it will be something more than that which is why I think the end result is a bit of a letdown compared to what you expect. Overall it does have some good scares, good performances, good music, and a true horror film feel. You just need to be able to tolerate the silly nature of the second half. If you can do that, I recommend it.

Well, the film is about a serial killer who on the verge of dying had no choice but to transfer his soul to a Good Guy which seems to be a sort of parody of the Cabbage Patch Kids and the My Buddy dolls. The same doll lands in the hands of a ten year boy named Andy Barclay and you know that sort of thing won't end well.I didn't write in the full summary mainly because I didn't want to mention any spoilers about the film. Maybe I did but oh well.But yeah, the premise of a killer doll took a new spin, instead of a doll coming to life on its own, the doll has the soul of a person. In this case, the soul is a serial killer.The acting is really well done. Actors such as Catherine Hicks and Chris Sarandon really put in a lot of effort into their roles and the script really helped. Alex Vincent who plays Andy Barclay who unlike a lot of kid actors made the character believable. But hands down, Brad Dourif is the best of the actors, Chucky is without a doubt one of my all time favorite villains and the character himself is a badass.Don Mancini, Tom Holland and John Lafia wrote a very clever script.Tom Holland who directed the film was clearly the perfect guy for a film like Child's Play.Any nitpicks?

Witness the scene where the single mother couldn't buy her son the Good Guy doll he so dearly wanted for his birthday, and has to face his disappointment and reassure him that she'll get one soon. How many parents had to face this scene in real life throughout the 80s? The film also manages to incorporate a sense of the multi pronged, multi-media merchandising attack of many toy lines of the decades. The Good Guy dolls are generally considered to be inspired by the My Buddy range, but note how they have their own cartoon show, which brings to mind thoughts of He-Man, Transformers, The Care Bears and so on. This kind of detail brings a level of wit to Child's Play that is ironically lacking in its increasingly comedic sequels.Child's Play is one of the cleverest and most entertaining horror movies of the 80s. OK, so Chucky isn't scary, but how many of us are really scared by Freddy, Jason, Jigsaw etc.? It is simply great fun, brilliantly executed.

Character actor Brad Dourif stars as Charles Lee Ray a notorious serial killer who is chased down by Detective Mike Norris into a toy store and gunned down. Under his dying breaths he transfers his soul into a Good Guy doll.We are now introduced to Andy Barclay,a kid who loves the Good Guys.The only thing he wants for his birthday is a Good Guy doll.His mother Karen who is short on money buys the Chucky doll from a hobo on the street.Chucky murders Karen's friend Maggie. Norris is assigned to the case and discovers the footprints of a Good Guy doll at the crime scene.Norris suspects Andy. Andy tells his mother that Charles Lee Ray is Chucky's real name.Chucky forces Andy to bring him to the run down home of his partner in crime Eddie Caputo. Chucky murders him. Norris finds Andy and his doll at the crime. Andy now thought to be insane is brought to a mental house. Karen brings the doll home and discovers it has no batteries. Chucky attacks her and runs to murder Norris.Norris escapes the attempt and helps Karen track Chucky down.

Tom Holland has directed a suspenseful horror film. The actors all excel in their roles,particularly Chris Sarandon as Norris. Unlike the other Child's Play films the cast and crew take the story seriously. The movie is dark and has an evil sense to it. The other Child's Play films are pathetic jokes,if you must see Chucky rent this one.By the way,I think this is one of the best portrayals of the city of Chicago on film.

It became clear afterwards that the outrageousness of the idea could lend itself to more humor-orientated sequels and that Chucky himself had potential that stretched beyond just one movie.As a result, this first Child's Play movie seems to be a bit different from the rest. Don't get me wrong, the franchise is pretty good with it's continuity which is unusual for horror films, but first time around the makers played it for straight, which gives it different edge from the rest. Obviously they didn't want to play their ace right away so for the most part, Chucky is rather quiet in this one. Later on, his star would shine brighter.Chicago cop Mike Norris guns down killer Charles Lee Ray in the street, but before Ray dies he breaks into a toy store and transfers his soul into a Good Guy doll. Knowledge of Voodoo is pretty much the first thing that you're taught in serial killer class. That very same doll is given to lonely little boy Andy Barclay for his birthday, but he's not aware of the evil lurking within.Judging the film on its own merits it's not exactly the best shocker out there. There are only a couple of scare moments and a couple of those are badly timed and obviously telegraphed. The story isn't as tight as it should be and there's simply not enough kills.

A few days later, six year old Andy Barclay (Alex Vincent) is given the same doll as a birthday present from his mother Karen (Catherine Hicks). Andy loves his new Good Guy doll, which is able to talk and move its head around.

When Karen Barclay finally realizes that Chucky is alive, she enlists Mike's help to stop the murderous doll and save Andy's soul.This fantastic modern day horror classic has one of the greatest premises ever conceived. Kudos go to director Tom Holland and writer Don Mancini for giving us this highly original and timeless film. Chucky is one of the greatest horror villains ever and in this movie, he is actually very scary. Brad Dourif was the perfect actor to give Chucky his voice, as well as playing the human Charles Lee Ray before he becomes a living doll. I'm so glad he returned for every installment in the series that followed this movie. Brad IS Chucky, and always will be. All the other actors here are very convincing and believable in their parts, Chris Sarandon from Fright Night being a favorite of mine. It's a shame he hasn't done more films in recent times. Catherine Hicks does very well as the concerned and protective mother, I genuinely felt bad for her in certain scenes. Usually I can't stand kids in horror movies, but Alex Vincent didn't annoy me at all and actually did very well here. Great job Alex! I also love the Chicago setting, which made for some beautiful big city scenery. The fact that it's also wintertime with snow on the ground enhanced that. The best thing about this movie, besides its great villain, is the suspense. Chucky is kept in the shadows for the first half of the movie and most of the kills are suggested. This was a great way to build scares and toy with the audience at the same time! I would recommend this movie for anyone who loves scary and suspenseful horror films with a great storyline, villain, and setting. Child's Play rules!

That particular doll winds up in the hands of a street pedlar who then sells it cheaply to Karen Barclay, a department store clerk who has been searching for a Good Guy doll as a birthday gift for her son Andy. Andy is excited to get the doll, calling it Chucky. But the doll comes alive & starts exacting his revenge on the people who got him killed. Chucky then attempts to transfer his soul again, this time to Andy. Can Karen & the detective on the case stop him?Film Review Ever since the 1929 effort THE GREAT GABBO, the possessed doll has had a number of appearances in the horror genre. The idea had its best airing in the portmanteau film DEAD OF NIGHT back in 1945, which is still regarded as the final word on the subject. In the 1980s, director Tom Holland, who had made the vampire classic FRIGHT NIGHT, decided to contemporise the story using the visual effects technology of the day.With a story that hangs its plot on the concept of a serial killer transferring his soul into a child's doll & then using the doll's body to commit further crimes, I wasn't expecting Child's Play to be scientifically plausible &#x96; one of the things about the horror genre is the required suspension of disbelief &#x96; but this film really drags the idea through the intellectual gutter that most of the Friday THE 13TH films inhabit (what is quite ironic about Child's Play is that with its wisecracking killer doll, it is similar to A NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET which came out only four years earlier).That said, the film works better as a parody, mainly setting its sights on the late 1980s trend of Cabbage Patch Dolls that drove both children & their parents crazy &#x96; the dolls didn't do anything, only they looked quite cute & had their own birth certificates! What better way to scare the public at the time then to exploit their worst ideas about those ridiculous dolls. Quite cynical really.However, with the commentary & all, Child's Play is really quite stupid. Besides the whole soul-transferring-into-doll business, the film throws in some absurd plot devices where Chucky's body slowly turns more human the longer the killer's soul inhabits it, as well as the most obvious idea of forcing Chucky to transfer his soul into the body of the first person he revealed his secret to (in this case, young Andy Barclay). Let's not get into the whole business that is the scene where Chucky confronts his mentor, a voodoo priest, & kills him using a voodoo doll.The shocks are well-staged, particularly the scene where Catherine Hicks discovers Chucky's secret (he's been walking, talking & killing without any batteries!) & the first two kills are suspenseful. But the film loses momentum with its action set-pieces, most notably the part where Chucky tries to kill his police nemesis while he's in his car, which is one of the most unintentionally funny scenes in the whole film. The climax is an amusing scaled-down parody of THE TERMINATOR but ruins itself with the climax going into overtime with Chucky proving to be quite hard to kill &#x96; he's a doll, it shouldn't be that hard to kill him!On the acting front, Catherine Hicks & Chris Sarandon are quite competent, but the film really belongs to Brad Dourif, who makes the role of the killer doll his own, a role he would polish in the sequels.

The latter has been the subject of several films, many of them horror and those like 'Magic' and 'Dead of Night' have not been forgotten. The same can be said for this film, which came at the tail end of the slasher film boom of the 1980s. But unlike others before it, this time the killer doll was made into a full-blown character and returned for four, count 'em, four sequels. This film proves that when dealing with evil, size doesn't matter.Pros An interesting new spin on the killer toy formula. Good performances. A pretty good score topped off with a main theme that'll stick in your head. Awesome special and make-up effects. Fast-paced. An exciting car sequence. Memorable kills. Director Holland does a fine job of creating suspense.Cons The low budget really shows. Has one ending too many. The idea of a doll, even one Chucky's size, overpowering an adult human is pretty silly.Final thoughts Just because this involves a toy doesn't mean you should let your kids watch it.

It's not quite a classic on par with the likes of 'The Exorcist' or 'Night of the Living Dead' but it holds it's own in the world of Horror.My rating 3.5/5 "},{"Title":"Chucky","Date":"28 March 2009","Score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Fantasy, Horror","Review":" Well what can you say about Chucky,, well let's see he's mean as you would ever want to see, funny as can be, can be very convincing, or ever child's darkest nightmare.. i first seen this when i was in my late teens so it didn't really affect me any, except to keep wanting to watch more of him, Charles Lee Ray a serial killer , gets corned by the police, but right before he is apprehended he performs some black magic and transforms himself into this department store 3 foot doll that kids love to play with, he goes on to wreak havoc the entire movie,, getting the little boy in mischief bit by precious bit,,, this movie does have some great haunting music to it as well, and like i said great one liners by chucky. l "},{"Title":"A fun late 80's killer doll horror winner","Date":"14 December 2008","Score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Fantasy, Horror","Review":" The evil spirit of vicious serial killer Charles Lee Ray (the ever creepy Brad Dourif) gets transferred into the body of a popular doll. Plucky single mother Karen Barclay (superbly played by Catherine Hicks) purchases the doll as a birthday present for her son Andy (an endearingly sweet performance by Alex Vincent). Chucky the doll comes back to murderous life and embarks on a killing spree. Director Tom Holland, working from a clever and witty script that he co-wrote with Don Mancini and John Lafia, treats the frankly silly story with admirable seriousness, keeps the pace brisk and unflagging throughout, and builds a good deal of tension which culminates in a lively and exciting conclusion. Moreover, although the tone is basically straight, Holland still injects the proceedings with a wickedly nasty sense of dark humor. Additional kudos are in order for the uniformly excellent acting by a bang-up cast Hicks makes for a sympathetic lead, Vincent is adorable as Andy, Dourif does the voice of Chucky with his customary rip-roaring crazed aplomb, plus there are sound contributions from Chris Sarandon as cynical, skeptical detective Mike Norris, Dinah Manoff as Karen's spunky best gal pal Maggie Peterson, Neil Giuntoli as Lee Ray's cowardly partner Eddie Caputo, Raymond Oliver as voodoo priest Dr. Death, and Alan Wilder as Karen's jerky boss Mr. Criswell. This film even manages to astutely address such timely 80's topics as single parenthood, mass media commercialization, and urban squalor and decay (Karen buys Chucky from a street peddler). The tight 87 minute running time ensures that the movie never drags or gets bogged down in needless tedious filler. Kevin Yagher's animatronic doll puppet f/x are nifty and impressive. Bill Butler's polished cinematography makes effectively fluid use of a prowling Steadicam. Joe Renzetti's shivery score does the shuddery trick. All in all, this surprise 80's horror hit holds up quite well and remains a neat little romp. "},{"Title":"Hi, I'm Chucky! WANNA PLAY?","Date":"5 December 2008","Score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Fantasy, Horror","Review":" If you know anything about actors, you know that every single one of them worth his or her weight in 'iambic pentameter' wants to do good, meaningful work, usually meaning stage work with the classics. Ibsen, Mamet, Odets, Shepard, those kind of guys. But you also know that stage work usually pays bupkis, union or not, and doin' the Bard don't pay da billz! So when something comes along that offers guaranteed paychecks, and may not be classic, but does give you something to sink your teeth into, then risk of typecasting be damned! It's like hitting the actor's version of Powerball. Robert Englund got his ticket when he met with a guy in a messed-up red-and-green sweater and a Ginsu manicure. Brad Dourif, famous for his role in ONE FLEW OVER THE CUCKOO'S NEST, hit the jackpot himself by landing a date with a crazed serial killer, who unfortunately, knows his way around some gris-gris spells.To true horror fans everywhere, that story is now legendary. Abandoned by the cronies who were supposed to be helping him escape, Charles Lee Ray, on the lam and being pursued by Detective Mike Norris (Chris Sarandon), is mortally wounded in a shootout that takes place in - would you believe it? - a toy store. Having learned a thing or two about voodoo while in stir from his cellie, a shaman nicknamed Dr. Death (Raymond Oliver), the dying Ray uses a dark incantation to transport his soul into the body of a Good Guy doll, coincidentally named Chucky. Norris, like everyone else, assumes that Ray died in the mysterious explosion that took place at the toy store. Meanwhile, the now-possessed doll finds its way into the hands of a homeless grifter who salvages it from the crime scene and sells it to hard-working mom Karen Barclay (Catherine Hicks). Knowing that it's a Good Guy doll, 'THE hot toy' of the moment and all that her seven-year-old boy, Andy (Alex Vincent) has wanted, she can't turn down this steal of a deal to get it for him as a birthday surprise. Actually, though, the surprise is on...everybody. Suddenly, Andy finds himself racking up quite a record as a pre-teen juvenile delinquent, as Charles/Chucky starts going after nosy babysitters, his voodoo teacher and all of his turncoat associates and pinning the blame on the kid. Only when Norris nearly becomes another notch on Chucky's overalls, does the cop begin to believe the story that Andy's been telling him, Karen and everyone else all along...the doll is alive and kicking and stabbing and strangling, and it has to be stopped! And the worst part? Not the murders, which are bad enough, but unless Charles Lee Ray can move his soul back into a human body, he will have to live as Chucky The Good Guy Doll forever. And the transfer has to be made into the body of the first human being he revealed himself to...ANDY.Up to this point, the only really scary 'doll' story that had been done was the Zuni fetish doll tale Prey in Dan Curtis's TV shocker TRILOGY OF TERROR. (Stuart Gordon's cult hit DOLLS, released a year earlier, didn't yet have the rep it does today.) Writer/Producer Don Mancini and director Tom (FRIGHT NIGHT) Holland knew they had a winner on their hands, but how could they have possibly imagined a franchise that has continued for at least SIX films? And Brad Dourif, though he only ever appeared in the very first movie, would continue to give Chucky the same kind of nasty, wise-ass attitude consistently through the entire series?It's hard to believe that there are still people who have never seen this, but if you haven't, be warned...you will want to drag your kids/siblings kicking and screaming past the Dolls aisle at Toys-'R'-Us, because after seeing CHILD'S PLAY, you won't want these little buggers within thirty MILES of your house ever again!!!

Of course I knew Chucky and I had seen this film in parts just like some of its sequels, recently I watched part of Child's Play 2 on TV by the way, and as a fact not long time ago I realized that the film's title was not Chucky and honestly I was surprised. In Mexico its title is Chucky, el muñeco diabolico (something like Chucky, the diabolic doll) and it is always referred as Chucky so and honestly I always thought that its original title was that.Anyway, I decided to finally get its DVD (I love this days since most of the horror films on DVD are on sale!) and I'm glad, certainly Child's Play was a pleasant movie for the Halloween weekend. This film is amazingly entertaining, maybe it is one of the most entertaining films I have seen and Chucky is truly a memorable character, extremely famous, a unique doll that can be more than just a headache, a doll that simply can kill you if he wants. He's a Good Guy, he's the doll of a quite popular TV show for kids and certainly Andy (Alex Vincent) is a fan of it. He seems to have seen already most of the episodes, he has the cereal of the show and for his birthday he wants one of the new and expensive dolls however his mother (Catherine Hicks) gave to him other stuff, we understand why since the Good Guy doll cost like $100 but we can't understand why she gave him clothes as present, you just can't give that to a kid! Anyway, thanks to her best friend Maggie (Dinah Manoff) Andy's mother finds a Good Guy doll that is selling a tramp and she could get it for $30, she knew that Andy really wanted a Good Guy.The idea is effective, I loved it since the danger comes from the last thing the characters could have imagine, you know you buy a doll for your son and it results to be a killer doll and we know why but who will believe Andy when he says that his Good Guy doll Chucky is alive? And this is great, having a kid saying that stuff about his doll then the kid is the main suspect of the murders, for sure a kid talking about stuff like that will end away of his parents, in this case only of his mother. To watch Chucky on fire is quite fun and I loved that and eventually more persons will see that Chucky is alive, certainly Andy's mother will be one of those persons but obviously nobody will believe her either, after all she's a desperate mother trying to save her son. Detective Mike Norris (Chris Sarandon) is an important character, he's one of the targets of Chucky since he is the cop who killed the strangler Charles Lee Ray. The very first sequence of the film has In Charles Lee Ray and Mike Norris its protagonists and we can watch that Charles Lee Ray knew certain stuff so when we see why he knew that stuff Andy becomes a target of Chucky. We enjoy a nice ending, Mike, Andy and his mother will fight but Chucky will survive to any kind of thing, he will be burned out, they will shot him, he will end in pieces but still he will be alive. So by then not only Andy, his mother and Mike knew that Chucky was alive but also Mike's partner who will also experience the anger of Chucky and he says something like this, after Mike said that if now he believes him yeah I believe you now, BUT WHO'S GONNA BELIEVE ME? "},{"Title":"Any film that can bring an inanimate object to life and make it come across as somewhat scary is at least a mild success.","Date":"2 August 2008","Score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Fantasy, Horror","Review":" After it's prologue, Child's Play begins with a sweeping of sorts shot that covers a living room in a Reagan era, late 1980s, working class American home that houses a single mother and her young child. It is a shot that incorporates objects complete with brand names, consumer driven toys and dolls and one that culminates in a television playing to nobody in the room (but perhaps to us?) displaying an inane cartoon specifically for kids. A young boy named Andy (Vincent) walks in; his face drops when he sees the screen and exclaims that 'he has seen this one'. I feel this is an attack on consumerism of some sort set in a contemporary time where the latest in modernity somehow finds its way into the working class home. The tracking shot of extensive produce twinned with the boy's quote of already having seen the episode could be read as a reminder that perhaps, it's all going too far.But this is the perfect introduction to the film's primary, and sadly only, theme. Child's Play does not need a realistic narrative of sorts; partly because it's an American horror film that ventures into the realms of fantasy, but also because its premise is one that maintains a voice and message throughout &#150; this is a statement on many, many things. The film revolves around the incoming of a toy doll into a household that is already housing a boy missing a fatherly figure. If the tracking shot is displaying consumerism, then the incoming doll of Chucky acts as a statement that the latest in gadgets and gimmicks can enter the household so very easily. But it also carries an eerie message that firstly asks us, 'Do we really know what we're buying?' and 'Is what we're buying ultimately safe?' Obviously, this is not some paranoid rant warning people that toys might come alive and attack you. What I think Child's Play does is highlight the dangers of giving into Consumerism so easily and buckling under the pressure of both a child's want for something and the ill knowledge you may carry regarding said object. This ignorance is best highlighted by Maggie (Manoff), a friend of Andy's mother who is fast paced, outlandish and just too confident when it comes to looking for the next gimmick and best way to purchase it &#150; it comes as no surprise that her encounter with the doll results, in the sense it gets the better of her and, quite literally as well as ironically, 'sneaks' up on her.But the film refrains from being anything brilliant due to its repetition of scenes and generally daft nature. The statement and ideas of Capitalist modernity in a post-modern world work well and these sorts of themes are said under a guise of, let's face it, a pretty mediocre slasher film riding on the success of Halloween and its sequels. Characters do this, characters do that, characters say things and get themselves into situations and scenarios that demand they ignore logic for the sake of the odd shock or thrill as suspense builds to a certain crescendo. But for what it is, Child's Play is kind of entertaining with some good scenes albethem illogical. The point of attack and opening exchanges involving Andy, Karen (Hicks) and the doll over whether or not it's really killing people is effective because we're given the position of power that we know the kid's telling the truth.Child's Play is relentless in its pacing and uses its unique selling point sparsely and wisely. I don't think the idea of a talking, killing doll had been done before Child's Play and I think it's largely down to the constant referencing and spoofing of the idea in other texts such as the Krusty doll in The Simpsons that has made Child's Play the 'cult' film that it is. The film takes on ideas of reincarnation when a robber is gunned down in the opening but instead of going out in a hail of bullets or dying with dignity, he possesses a child's doll which is an interesting if not accidentally comical idea when you say it out loud. But the ideas of reincarnation are limited to bizarre incidences that go by very quickly and consist of brief interactions with voodoo driven, black priests in grotty apartments which merely act as nasty locations for Chucky the doll himself to maim said poor fellow.There is more in Child's Play than I thought there would be and certainly, the opening forty minutes or so is interesting because 'less' of the doll very much feels like 'more' of the doll as he goes on a personal vendetta. Plus, the suspense and a few of the deaths are either surprising or just work in a low-rent horror inspired sort of way. Kathy's interaction and gradual, I feel, affection for detective Mike Norris (Sarandon) whose best scene involves him being in an upturned car with the doll running around outside is also good fun to watch. But once asylums complete with rooms that look like operating theatres begin to crop up and certain characters have their brains fried purely because the filmmakers are able to include that effect occur, it feels as if it is dragging &#150; a bizarre thing to have to say about a film that's under 90 minutes long.

His mother, Karen sees no foul play until one night when tragedy strikes (I won't say what to avoid putting spoilers). Soon its a race to save her son from this mysterious new threat.

We have great acting from Brad Dourif, who plays Chuckie perfectly. Even Andy was very well played for a 5 year old. The mood in this movie is very dark at times. A lot of scenes are poorly lit on purpose to add to the eeriness. Also, the music used makes the movie very tense and dark.

Right at the end of 80's horror. People actually thought the film was scary. What worse a thought than your child's toy coming to life and attempting to possess his body while knocking off people all the way!? Add to this that ever single child in America had one of those My Buddy dolls at the time and there ya go. The Look as well as the wardrobe worn by Chucky was eerily familiar with the My Buddy Doll so much in fact that the dolls started scaring children and children being scared may have led to the demise and decline in sales of My Buddy. But that's just my opinion.So basically we get the story of Charles LeRay (Brad Douriff) - The Boston Strangler. During a night of chases and shootouts with the cops, Charles takes a bullet and is about done for. While finding his way into a toy store, the voodoo educated serial killer puts his voodoo to use and puts his soul in the Good Guy doll which just so happens to be the current Toy craze in this film. We then go to young Andy Barclay (Alex Vincent) who wants one so bad for his birthday. His mother is having a difficult time finding one but manages to pull it off from a creepy old street vendor who rescued the doll from the toy store fire. Which dolls survived? The possessed one of course. So we get Andy trying to convince people that Chucky is alive all the while Chucky is killing. The movie is great for it's time. While I don't see much scary about it, it is definitely fun. The FX are top notch for a 1988 flick. Best scene bar none is the elevator scene for the sheer comedy of it.

It wasn't too long ago that I finally got to see it and now I believe the first Child's play is the best in the series. This film is special in the fact that the series wasn't a parody of itself yet, that the character of Chucky wasn't on center stage (Though he definitely plays a big role in this movie of course.) I'll try to keep details on the plot as short as possible, but basically its about a boy named Andy who gets a Good Guy doll for his birthday. The one doll he receives happens to be alive thanks to a voodoo ritual that transfers the soul of a serial killer (Named Charles Lee Ray) The doll named Chucky sneaks around and murders innocent people but fingers are pointed at Andy, since after all who would believe that a toy is alive and killing people. Chucky throughout the film is attempting to become human again by possessing Andy's body, since he can only use Andy because he was the first person who knows who he is in doll form (Though at first Andy doesn't know Chucky is evil.) I'll leave the rest of the plot for you to see.A lot of people complain that the plot of the movie is stupid and lame. They comment how if in real life Chucky attacked they could overpower the doll so easily, and that it wouldn't be a problem at all. Personally I think using a doll as a villain makes the movie so much more better. A lot of people have a irrational fear of dolls (The way they look, their frozen faces and postures, how they seem to stare at you wherever you are in a room.) and that really enhances that in this film. Secondly, Chucky isn't a generic monstrous brute who kills victims with pure brawn. He waits for the right moments, hides in the right places, and strikes when your guard is down. And even if he didn't, would YOU really know what to do if all of a sudden a doll came to life with a knife in his hand and lunged at you? I think you'd be too scared to even react (They even explain in the movie that Chucky has superhuman strength, which makes him hard to overpower despite his size.) I also wanted to comment that I liked the fact that although Chucky is the villain in this, he does not talk all that much in the film nor is he seen as much as the sequels, which gives him this sneaky, mysterious persona. I enjoyed him in the sequels but there were times I found him to be a little over the top and overly amusing. Its also interesting to see that Chucky himself looks more primitive and less realistic than in the sequels which I found gave a gritty and dark feeling.Another strong point in the film is the good acting, especially Alex Vincent who plays Andy. One scene I like in particular is when he's in the hospital and realizes Chucky is searching for him. He starts to despair and cries hysterically, which I thought was brilliant acting for such a young boy.

The latest craze, they even have spin-off cartoons and cereal commercials. But lo and behold, Toys R Us charges a bl**dy fortune, so his mum (Catherine Hicks) gets a deal from a homeless guy who has one in his cart. Unbeknowst to mum, this doll has inherited the soul of Charles Lee Ray (Brad Dourif), a psycho who was shot by Detective Mike Norris (Chris Sarandon) in a toy store. Charles Lee Ray landed next to a stand of Good Guy dolls, and thru voodoo magic, he impregnated Chucky with his SOUL!!!! Needless to say, Andy and his mum are pretty pleased. But no sooner has Chucky been welcomed into the family, the babysitter turns up dead! And what's more...Det Norris thinks little Andy is to blame! Soon enough though, the mayhem breaks loose (heck, it's only 87 minutes long) and we are treated to a slasher movie with a difference. No more plot spoilers...the rest of the story is pretty easy to figure out.Catherine Hicks plays the stressin' mum really well here, we can tell she's very fond of her kid and doesn't want ol Chucky to make mincemeat of him (even though he is darn good at it), so she begins the track down the origin of the evil so we can destroy it part of the plot. Meanwhile little Andy begins to realise Chucky is Bad with a capital B, and in his attempt to escape Chucky we find some of the great little moments of tension this movie flicks at you from time to time. The scalpel scene made my hair stand on end...mostly coz Alex Vincent looked so damn clumsy and I was afraid he'd fall on the damn thing...but director Tom Holland got some really fine moments out of this little actor, like the Chucky's coming and he's going to kill me! bit. I was on the edge of my seat when Andy's lookin out the barred window to see Chucky methodically making his way towards the cell...eerie stuff! The movie is predictable and unbelievable but hey, this is an 80's horror flick, lighten up! Double bill it with some other fun horror flick, break out the popcorn and have a blast. 87 minutes well spent.

Now, as an adult at 21, I'm glad to say that it doesn't scare me at all, but nonetheless this movie marked the beginnings of another classic screen slasher, soon to be followed by the inevitable countless sequels.The 1980s were dominated by the likes of Jason Voorhees, Michael Myers and Fred Krueger, so why is the slasher in Child's Play so scary? Because the slasher is, you guessed it from looking at the posters, a doll. Perhaps Child's Play was an attempt by the filmmakers to cash in on the doll craze of the '80s, you know, from My Buddy to the Cabbage Patch Kids, the dolls your kids just *had* to have.With that said after having viewed this film in its entirety for the first time, I'm glad to say that I never owned such a play-thing growing up. He might have tried to hurt me, or even worse, possess me, which is exactly what happens here in this neatly packaged and entertaining, albeit clichéd little horror film from Fright Night director Tom Holland.In the opening moments, Chicago detective Mike Norris (Holland's Fright Night alumni Chris Sarandon) has managed to mortally wound serial killer Charles Lee Ray (Brad Dourif) as he runs into a toy store. In the haste of the chase, Ray dies, but not before having transferred his soul (using Voodoo magic) into a conveniently placed Good Guy doll. One special effects explosion later, the Good Guy doll winds up in the loving arms of six-year-old Andy Barclay (Alex Vincent) as a birthday present from his widowed mom Karen (Catherine Hicks) after the struggling mother buys it off the street from a peddler.After the babysitter takes a swan dive out the kitchen window, Norris is brought in to investigate the possibility that sweet little Andy may have a homicidal dark side. But Andy insists that his new Good Guy doll, who he has given the name Chucky, killed the babysitter and that his real name is Charles Lee Ray, the recently deceased serial killer. No one believes Andy's claims that Chucky is possessed by the soul of a dead serial killer, but Chucky's homicidal rampage continues with Andy looking more and more like a child in desperate need of attention.It is not without some degree of irony that Child's Play, despite its familiar slasher flick trappings, seems to represent every parent's worst nightmare that make-believe can become flesh & blood reality sometimes - and it's also hard to believe that something so innocent could be so dangerous. Perhaps if the slasher route had not been taken, Child's Play could have enjoyed endless possibilities as a psychological thriller. But this is not to say that the film is a total failure. In fact, in Holland's hands, he keeps the tension mounting from the get-go up until Chucky claims his first victim nearly 30 minutes into the picture. Even by strictly abiding by typical horror film conventions, Holland makes sure his film is tight and creepy with some above-average performances from the leads and a truly dark sense of humor.Chucky, voiced by Dourif, is one creepy-looking doll with an attitude and very foul mouth. Dourif's voiced Chucky in all of the sequels and despite a very limited role, he was really able to do a lot with his voice and darkly humored one-liners. This does somewhat allow him to stand out against his counterparts who are all bigger than he is and could easily get the drop on him. As fate would have it, though, Chucky would spend the next two sequels trying to transfer his soul into poor Andy and failing miserably every time. And he even received another playmate in the form of the equally-murderous Tiffany in Bride of Chucky (1998).Make-believe - it's not Child's Play anymore.7/10 "},{"Title":"Despite Some Flaws, a Decent Suspense Flick.","Date":"13 July 2007","Score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Fantasy, Horror","Review":" Child's Play contains the predictable horror and suspense that one would expect for this type of film. However, what sets it apart from other films of this nature is that the killer is a talking doll.SPOILERS The story is simple. Little Andy wants a Good Guy doll. The latest fad for kids. The doll is expensive, so his mother gets a deal on a Good Guy doll at about half price from a street vendor. Unknown to her, this doll has inherited the soul of a killer who gets fatally shot by a cop on his trail at a toy store in a poor neighborhood. In a bizarre twist, the killer falls next to a box of Good Guy dolls and is struck by lightning. Each Good Guy doll has a distinct name and personality all his own.Chucky the bad doll, has now inherited the soul of a killer! When Andy's mother buys him the doll, strange accidents begin to happen, with no material witnesses except Andy around when they occur. Naturally, the authorities are slow to believe that Chucky is alive and evil. After Chucky attacks Mom, she realizes that she must not only convince the authorities of who Chucky really is, but try to protect her son before Chucky kills him.The pacing of Child's Play for the most part is suspenseful and direct. Running at just under 90 minutes. sustains interest throughout most of the movie. There are some scenes that are overdone, such as taking forever for Chucky to die by having his body break off individually into small pieces after being shot multiple times. This seemed to be a time killer. A lot of these types of movies have the almost invincible killer element to them, which can make them look stupid in these types of scenes. But the overall effect is simple, yet effective horror.Child's Play is a better movie than one might expect. See it.

I watched this movie for the first time in 1997, almost ten years after the launching in the theaters. The movie begins, and there is Charles Lee Ray and Mickey shooting each other, I didn't like this scene, I was there to watch a killer doll... Then Charles enter in the toy store, and finally transfers his soul to the doll's body. I'll never forget the way the camera focused the empty eyes of the Chucky doll. Passing the Andy's party, and finally going to the part where he gets the doll, my nerves starts to freak out. A boy and his mother living in an apartment, without knowing that they have a murderer between then. The great director Tom Holland only shows the doll running, and speaking, after the middle of the movie. This is enough time to be scary of the innocent Chucky, with just one expression in the face, but the audience knows that inside that face, there is a mastermind, conspiring to put his soul in Andy's body. We don't know what he thinks, what he plans to do, nothing. This give a sensation of defenseless to the audience, and much more to the Barclays. Finally Mrs. Barclay gets crazy about her son goes to a institution to crazy kids, and almost throw Chucky in the fireplace, but then what we all expect to see in the whole movie happens, CHUCKY GETS ALIVE! And bite Mrs. Barclay's arm. This scene was really good, the face and the voice of Chucky change by surprise, and I almost screamed. And finally the final battle, this was the best, a claustrophobic sensation, with Chucky surrounding the Barclays. The whole movie was a roller-coaster ride, but a roller-coaster ride that you will never forget, a roller-coaster ride that will make you feel the will to watch again, and again and again. Child's Play is a classic movie, forget about the sequels, this movie is unique, and will be in my child memory forever.

Basically detective Mike Norris (Fright Night's Chris Sarandon) is chasing the notorious murderer, The Lakeshore Strangler, Charles Lee Ray (Brad Dourif, also voicing) (named after Charles Manson, Lee Harvey Oswald, and James Earl Ray), and he mortally wounds him with a gunshot, but before Ray dies he does a voodoo incantation to transport his soul into the body of a Play Pals Inc. Good Guy Doll. Andy Barclay (Alex Vincent) is celebrating his sixth birthday, and after seeing the commercial he is desperate to get a Good Guy Doll, and his widowed mother Karen (Catherine Hicks) manages to buy one from a street peddler, her son is overjoyed to receive his doll, named Chucky. Later the same night Karen's best friend Maggie Peterson (Dinah Manoff) babysits the little boy, and she is hit in the head by someone, before crashing through the window and falling to her death and landing on a car. Mike is investigating the death, and small footprints found suggest that maybe Andy did it, and the nest day, apparently from Chucky requesting, the little boy takes his doll to the house of Ray's former accomplice Edward 'Eddie' Caputo (Neil Giuntoli), and it explodes. Andy is questioned about these recent events, and he blames it all on his doll Chucky, and because of this apparent disassociation with reality he is placed in a psychiatric ward, while his doll is left behind. Karen is throwing away the box that the Good Guy Doll came in, and the batteries that are meant to be inside it drop out, she confirms there are no batteries inside the doll, and he comes to life in her hands, attacks her and dashes away. Mike refuses to believe her story that the doll is alive, and possessed with the soul of Charles Lee Ray, that is of course until he is attacked himself, and they know now that Chucky is after Andy for a reason. Chucky goes to visit his voodoo instructor from years past, John, as he got shot and is bleeding, meaning that the longer he stays in the doll body the more human he is becoming, and he may be trapped, the only way to get out is to transfer his soul into the first person he revealed his true identity to, that is Andy. Before dying from his hideous injuries John told Karen and Mike that they must kill Chucky before he can get to Andy, they have to aim for his heart, and he meanwhile has tracked the little boy to the psychiatric unit, but he has already escaped to head home. Andy is knocked unconscious for a few moments after Chucky hits him on the head with a baseball bat, and starts his incantation to transport his soul, but Karen and Mike get there to stop him. After a struggle Chucky is trapped in the fireplace, and with the gas stove he is set on fire until apparently dead, until of course he gets up and tries to attack again, with his arms and legs shot off, until finally he is killed with a bullet through the heart. Also starring Tommy Swerdlow as Jack Santos, Jack Colvin as Dr. Ardmore and Home Alone's Alan Wilder as Mr. Criswell. Vincent is adorable as the little boy victim, and Sarandon and Hicks do their parts fine, but the star of the film is of course Chucky, brought to life with pretty good puppetry techniques and the great fiendish and wisecracking voice of Dourif. You may think it is a little cheesy in modern terms, but at the time this cult scary movie did cause a big stir, not just being a hit, but people wanting it banned, of course now it is just seen as a standard slasher movie, so if you interested to see where Chucky the killer doll came from, then this is it, an enjoyable enough horror.

Much killing goes on.

However on re-watch I saw that in this modest horror movie is a sly notion about commercialism and the overall marketing kids go nuts for. I was too young to understand this edge because well you never pick up on these type of things when you are fifteen but living through not only the Cabbage Patch kids craze, the ninja turtle phase and Pokemon stage one assumes that this all amounts to black comedy. The whole boy cries wolf angle never works and it is partially due to Vincent's irritating whining through out but whenever Chucky attacks an adult or scampers across the room (Which is obviously a midget) Chucky's attacks amount to hilarious antics. The hysterical antics continue through out as doll keeps coming no matter how many bullets, how burned and how much harm is inflicted upon it.

CATHERINE HICKS is the mother of a small boy, ALEX VINCENT, who wakes her up early in the morning to celebrate his birthday. Disappointed, she buys him a Good Guy doll he's been asking for. Enter Chucky. He's something, isn't he? his mother says delightedly when the boy gets Chucky to say a phrase. As it turns out, Chucky can do much more than utter his standard phrase.He's something, all right. From then on, the boy begins to discover things about his favorite doll that has him warning his parents and anyone who will listen that the doll is possessed. Of course, no one believes him until it is too late and a couple of murders have occurred. The mother is a bit slow to catch on but there's a chilling moment when she realizes the doll has no batteries inside it.Really frightening stuff, directed with great skill by Tom Holland and played to the hilt by a good cast. All the special effects for the doll's menace are extremely well done.Summing up Creepy tale provides a good dose of thrills and chills. "},{"Title":"Serial Killer Turns Into Mad-Doll.  Silly Idea, Mediocre Horror Fashion","Date":"4 March 2006","Score":"1 out of 3 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Fantasy, Horror","Review":" Child's Play is one of those horror movies that has an original idea, but that same idea is silly and results in, you guessed it, a mediocre movie overall. When serial-killer Charles Lee Ray is turned into a Good Guy doll (by some ritual that's hinted at but not thoroughly explained later) he begins to put a young boy and his mother through their paces. Young Andy gets what he's been begging to get for his B-day with Chucky, only he gets a little more than what he and his mother bargained for.This idea does help give Child's Play credit for at least trying to be original, I'll give it that, but the movie itself is lackluster. The movie doesn't bore you to death, it almost bores you to the point of snoring within the first scenes. But what really kills the movie is that it's completely devoid of anything scary and lacks virtually any thrills. With that, the movie seems to lack what would make a horror movie in any way good. At least you're not given the usual drunk teen at parties atmosphere that almost every horror movie has. Yet, the acting in the movie isn't anything great, Andy surprisingly being the most fake character in the movie. The only real acting talent in Child's Play is the ever-lovable personality that Chucky has, which I love to quote from this and the other Child's Play movies.However, despite a doll with a nasty personality and being original, Child's Play doesn't do anything that is in any shape or form worthy of being thrilling or scary. You just get a serving of cheap horror deaths and swearing. If you really need to see this movie, don't bother renting, wait for it to come on TV until you decide if you truly think it's worth watching again for entertainment.

I have to say that the idea of a doll being scary is pathetic, especially since dolls can be easily ripped apart and thrown away. My point is Chucky is not scary at all.The movie starts out as some kind of action movie. We see this criminal named Charles Lee Ray running away from a police officer. He gets shot a few times, and then hides out in a toy store. When he's about to die, he says some kind of voo-doo chant, and then his soul gets transported into the body of a doll. Later on, when a mother of a child buys the doll for her son, Charles (nicknamed Chucky) starts terrorizing the son and the mother and others that are in the way.The movie has some good thriller elements in it, but they only last for a short while. The movie is more of a thriller than a horror film. There are just not enough scares.The acting in the movie is very goofy and annoying at times. The kid was extremely over-acting in his role, and the mother seemed like a clichéd character. The hero cop in the film didn't seem tough enough to be a cop! Finally, the character of Chucky seemed more like a criminal than a horror villain. Well, he was actually BOTH criminal & horror villain. But he's one of the weakest horror villains ever, along with Jigsaw from the Saw movies. If you were to put Chucky against horror villains such as Freddy Krueger, Jason Voorhees, or the Candyman, Chucky would get ripped to shreds. Chucky isn't a true horror villain; he's just a typical criminal that doesn't do enough to scare others.To sum up, this is a very weak horror movie. It has a few good scenes, but the horror element is missing. The film is more of a kind of crime/thriller than a horror, which at least makes the movie watchable. Watch it if you haven't seen it before, or if you are afraid of dolls.I give this movie a 5/10 "},{"Title":"The definitive killer doll movie!","Date":"26 April 2005","Score":"1 out of 3 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Fantasy, Horror","Review":" CHILD'S PLAY is a very fun, suspenseful & very clever, scary, well put together horror thriller. The direction by Tom Holland is top notch. Holland is able to milk every ounce of suspense just perfectly, employing many jump out of you're seat moments & some really good, gripping edge of you're seat suspense sequences. He often uses the camera at times as an omniscient stalker, for much of the first half of the film, resulting in a few tense moments. Holland also conceives some weird moments, particularly with the ending, where the headless, one leg/arm missing, badly charred body of Chucky, attacks a cop while under the control of Chucky's severed head. The Chucky doll is very cleverly conceived & executed by KEVIN YAGHER. In fact, rarely has a doll been so creepy as this one. Unlike the sequels that followed, which took somewhat of a comedic route (more so in Parts 4 & 5) CHILD'S PLAY was & still is the only true dead serious film in the series. It remains a mercilessly effective, top notch horror thriller, that definitely should please all horror fans. The build up to some of the kills are very effective & expertly pulled off. The acting is very well done, especially by young ALEX VINCENT & CHRIS SARANDON (Re-teaming with Director Holland from FRIGHT NIGHT) who is well cast in the role of a homicide detective, trying to make sense of it all. CATHERINE HICKS is well cast as Andy's mom, while BRAD DOURIF who plays Chrles Lee Ray & voices the doll, is perfection as the main villain of the piece. This is definitely one of his best performances as a an actor & in a series role that he will no doubt be best remembered for. In a way, the film could arguably be seen as a spoof on the whole CABBAGE PATCH DOLL craze of the early eighties, as well as a salty poke in the eye, to greedy conglomerates squeezing out as much money as they can from paying customers, wanting to make their children happy by buying them a doll (It is stated in the movie, that the dolls run for a hundred bucks a piece). but also having them be gouged of extra cash, by having to buy the accessories that go with the doll, since all the items to fully complete it are sold separately. The film also focuses on (albeit briefly) the never ending phenomenon of a highly profitable craze, based on a certain toy or cartoon that has become a must have, as this film hot selling toy doll has it's own Cartoon on TV, breakfast cereals, children's clothes & even sneakers, all bearing the logo & image of the doll itself. The film also introduces a somewhat interesting scenario at about the mid way point, where Chucky finds himself growing more human inside the doll, to the point he can be injured & even trapped inside the doll's body, never to get out & even be killed in it, if he soon don't trade souls with the first person he told his secret to, that being young Andy & that he can only be stopped by destroying his heart.All that out of the way, the film isn't perfect, in fact there are a few flaws the film has that way it down a little at times. I guess my biggest pet peeve would be Chucky in human form (Played by BRAD DOURIF) CHARLES LEE RAY is supposed to be a serial killer, but yet doesn't act or resemble one. In fact he reminds one of a robber not a serial killer, since he is hardly anything you would call scary or even menacing. I just wasn't buying the fact that he was a killer & the same goes for his partner. Another thing is how the film-makers keep Chucky off screen for the first half. Obviously the film-makers & writers were attempting to toy with the audience, making them wonder if Charles Lee Ray, has indeed been able to transfer his soul into the doll, or if he died that night & it's actually Andy doing all these nasty things. The problem is, is that this angle just doesn't work. It might have had it not been for numerous scenes at the beginning, where we can clearly see the doll is alive, where we see Chucky move his head on his own, in a couple scenes, which begs the question Why bother with an attempted mystery angle, when the answer to who is killing, is given almost from the beginning? A scene where Andy travels across town with Chucky, further proves this theory even more so, when we see Chucky clearly moving around in order to see his old partner who left him behind. Chucky can be seen setting up for his partners execution. None of the psychological elements or the mystery elements of who might be the killer is surprising, since the film was originally written to be a psychological thriller, before being heavily re-written. In fact the original psychological driven script was later adopted & re-written in area's, to become the direct to video released PINOCCHIO'S REVENGE (a.k.a. The Pinocchio Syndrome) in the mid nineties. So in a way it could be argued that CHILD'S PLAY was remade. Great score as well. Written by HOWARD FRANKLIN (who is uncredited), DON MANCINI, Director Holland & JOHN LAFIA (Who would later go on to helm Part 2). Highly recommended to horror fans. If you haven't seen this one yet, go & rent it now! You will not be disappointed.

I thought(well, used to think) It's a horror film about a murderous *doll* and it's an 80's flick with a bunch of actors in it that I've never heard of. This film proves quite well how wrong you can judge a book by its cover. Yes, it is a doll doing all the killing, but it's pretty damn creepy. It's also far more creative and smart than your average doll, uh, killer. See the trailer to get an idea of how unusual and creative the death scenes are. The plot is surprisingly good, though there are weak points. The whole voodoo/magic thing concerning Chucky's birth is kind of... lame and far-fetched, honestly. It is, however, also quite original. And it's the only truly low point for me about the film. Then there's the whole 80's film complex that most, if not all, 80's films have been cursed with. The curse includes, but is not limited to hammy acting, bad dialog, soundtrack consisting of dreaded 80's music and predictability. Fortunately, this film suffers very little under this. The dialog is very obviously 80's at some points, and the acting could definitely improve, particularly with some of the minor characters, but the film manages to create a good deal of unpredictable scenes and the music is so neutral that you couldn't possibly tell from the soundtrack that it's an 80's film. The pacing is pretty good, there's really no point during the film where it's boring. The acting ranges, but the leads are mostly good. I thought the child actor who portrayed Andy did a pretty good job, considering he was 6-7 years old when he did the film. The special effects are so-so, but considering that this was the late 80's, they're sufficiently good, and they are used to great effect. There are plenty of genuine scares in the film. I enjoyed the cinematography, particularly the very good use of long takes and tracking shots. The ending was overdone, and came off as annoying rather than particularly scary. All in all, the film is definitely worth watching if you're into the genre. In the end, it's better than most other 80's flicks, and if you do see it available for rent, it'll probably be cheap, and hey, it's less than 90 minutes long, so it's easy enough to get through. I recommend this to fans of horror films and 80's flicks. If you belong to one of those groups, you'll most likely enjoy it, at least to some extent. 7/10 "},{"Title":"Playing With Old Horror Movie Cliches.","Date":"30 July 2004","Score":"1 out of 3 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Fantasy, Horror","Review":"  A criminal (Brad Dourif) with a knowledge of the occult transfers his soul from his dying body to the body of a child's toy.

A single mom strapped for cash buys it from a hobo to give to her annoying little brat-of-a-son for his birthday, and it tells him its name is Chucky. As bizarre and horrible events begin to happen, such as her son being around when his babysitter falls to her death and a house blows up in a derelict part of town, his mom begins to suspect that Chucky is behind it all.Sure, Chucky has its moments. In and of itself, it's a rather freaky looking doll. What annoyed me was the bad acting, unoriginal and highly cheesy plot and boring soundtrack. The little boy was sweet, but in that too-fake, very annoying way so that each time he talked I wanted to rip his head off a little more. It was easy to predict the next move of the doll, and I think I would have found it more enjoyable when I was twelve years old and I was still into Goosebumps.Overall, Child's Play is not a bad movie.

That is probably why the fourth and fifth movies of the series were basically all comedy rather than horror.

The story has a guy who is running from the police, as a last ditch effort he uses a technique he learned to transplant his soul into a toy doll. Well a mother buys her son this rather ugly doll and now Chucky is telling the boy what to do. There is a cop who begins to suspect something and then there is the climax that seems to center on really torturing Chucky.

It has its moments of being somewhat creepy, but then it has its rather humorous scenes such as the old couple and the elevator scene. The doll is done rather well as it looks like one of those stupid my buddy dolls, while being creepier in appearance. It also moves very well too as it is puppets rather than any computer stuff which is always a good thing. Still, Chucky just has a way of making me laugh.

The film started as an idea by Don Mancini and David Kerscheiner as a metaphor on the huge Cabbage Patch Kids craze of the 80's with voodoo themes to it, Tom Holland (Fresh off Fright Night) agreed to direct the project. Manci and Kerschner were influenced by films like Richard Attenbourgh's Magic and Trilogy of Terror even a bit from the TV show The Twilight Zone on episodes like The Dummy, Talking Tina and Caesar and Me. The performances are surprisingly good even by Jack Colvin whom you all know as Mcgee on the classic Incredible Hulk TV show and Hicks is quite sexy as the MILF heroine, Kevin Yagher's special effects and animatronics are fantastic for they have hold up well in this age of CGI.

Albeit the story is quite original, and the concept itself pretty scary, the payoff would have been a whole lot more effective had he transported himself into something a bit more fierce. Yes yes, that is part of the whole duality of the situation. That doesn't stop it from not being good. The direction was good, the acting was par (Chris Saradon is always great), but it just wasn't tense or scary past the age of 12 max.He'll have his fans, but I'm just going to leave Chucky in the box.

First off, I would like to say that in real life that doll would have died a lot quicker. There would be no b.s. the doll would pick up the knife and he would have gotten shot in the head immediately. And no, he wouldn't have gotten up, BECAUSE HE'S A DOLL, NOT FRIGGIN SUPER-MAN! HE'S MADE OF WOOD, THERE WOULD BE NO HEAD LEFT! And, in real life, he would have burned a lot quicker. Let me remind you that it wan't some sort of super-demon that inhabited this doll. It was a person, an ordinary person, who could, even while he was in the doll, feel pain. If I was lit on fire, I wouldn't get up. I would just lay there, because I would be in an a$$-load of pain. IT WAS A DOLL. A DOLL THAT COULD FEEL PAIN. HELL, GIVE ME A LIGHTER AND SOME GAS, I'LL KILL THE LITTLE BASTARD!

The Seed of Chuckie was the least scary...Britney Spears? Well whoever wrote this movie has some serious problems...at first I used to be so scared of it but then it kinda hit me that it was retarded because it's not realistic at all.

But I don't find the idea of a foul mouthed, deranged Cabbage Patch Kid as a villain to be very effective. Especially when he used to be a regular guy (well, OK, a strangler), and now he's stuck in child's doll and more p.o.'d than ever.Andy Barclay is an adorable, lisping little boy insanely obsessed with his favorite TV characters, the Good Guys. When he finds out that Good Guys are actually on the market as talking dolls, he wants nothing more than for his mother, Karen, to get him one. Unfortunately for Andy, mom is poor and can't afford the hundred bucks for the doll. But before long, she's buying one for a lower price from a peddler in an alley. Unfortunately for both she and Andy, the doll was possessed by Charles Lee Ray, or Chucky as his friends call him, a serial killer.Andy is ecstatic with his new best buddy. Chucky begins spouting off to him right away, revealing himself to be alive (though we don't actually hear from him at this point), but of course no one buys Andy's comments that the doll has a mind of its own. Then, the killing begins. Actually, Chucky only manages to take out two people before Andy is blamed for the deaths and locked up in a weird mental home. Soon after, Karen finally finds out the truth about Chucky, as Chucky flies into a rage and attacks her for messing with him. Karen goes off trying to get a cop to believe her, and Chucky goes off to talk with his voodoo guru, some guy who looks like Bill Cosby and who taught Chucky how to beat death. Voodoo guy is outraged at the abomination before him, but Chucky finally gets it out of him that to become human again, Chucky must transfer his soul into Andy. A little while later, it's the final showdown. This movie is loopy as hell from the start, but the final showdown is hilarious. At least, it is if you don't buy killer Cabbage Patch Kids as frightening foes. If you do buy it, then the humor of seeing one of them fly backwards through the air in slow mo after getting shot, or suddenly scrunching up his face in a fit of fury and charging forward to attack someone might be lost on you. But how anyone could miss the plain campy, cheesy *badness* of this goofball horror movie is beyond me (Count how many seconds Chucky screams Ayiyiyiyiyiyiyi!! for no reason at one point). The creators surely didn't miss it. No one can convince me that this movie isn't tongue in cheek. If you watch it as a comedy, like I do, you may find yourself quite entertained. "},{"Title":"Chucky?

Sorry, folks.  As a comedy it's wonderful...even though Scary Movie was better.  But call me jaded.  Nothing scares me anymore.  After a few films, the genre was done for me way back when.  The concept of having a doll come to life for evil purposes was used a few times by Rod Serling in the old Twilight Zone series.  What does this movie contribute to the genre of REALLY being afraid? Folks, have we run completely out of NEW ideas? (The only thing that would frighten me is if cheesy movies like this were the only kinds we could see.  Now THAT'S a horror). I wonder if one day they will ever get accomplished writers to contribute to horror flicks..that is, instead of nerdy, overgrown horror-fan wannabes.  Maybe there is hope and a real plot will emerge from the hot air.  And maybe, just maybe, we can get these villians to have really interesting MOTIVES that are not hackneyed.  Maybe Speilberg will make one really good one, one day! Well...I can dream, can't I?

Andy (Alex Vincent) the young son of Karen Barclay (Catherine Hicks) is disappointed when he doesn't get a Good Guy doll for his birthday, sensing his obvious disappointment Karen jumps at the opportunity to buy one cheap from a derelict no questions asked. At first Andy is delighted by his Good Guy who responds to the name Chucky, however Andy stats to treat Chucky a lot like a real person & when Karen's best friend Maggie (Dinah Manoff) dies in a mysterious accident the police become involved. The evil spirit of Ray stuck in the body of Chucky the killer Good Guy doll wants revenge...Directed by Tom Holland Child's Play is a pretty decent horror film, it's not the best I've ever seen but it's far from the worst. The script by Don Mancini obviously tackles the horror sub-genre of the killer toy based film but Child's Play was a rather more serious take on the them than the likes of Puppet Master (1989) & the Demonic Toys (1992) films, in fact the Child's Play series would become more & more light hearted as it went for outrageous gore coupled with black humour & lots of one-liners. Anyway, for the first half it tries to be more of a psychological horror as not much is given away & I guess the audience is not supposed to know whether there is a killer doll running around or whether it's all a figment of Andy's imagination & as such the foul-mouthed Chucky as we now know & love him doesn't make an appearance until about half way through the film. I also think the way it takes itself so seriously (maybe a reason why the recent instalment's are better because they don't?) hurt it overall with some very silly scenes, the sequence when Karen drops Chucky & he runs out of the apartment in a matter of seconds for instance, I'm sorry but there's no way on Earth he could have reached the lock & opened the door let alone reach the elevator buttons so quickly without anything to stand on at least. I wasn't keen on the end either as the torso of Chucky with just one arm & one leg manages to crawl through an air vent, burst out & nearly strangle a guy, it just doesn't work as a scene & comes across as ridiculous. Having said that there is still much here to entertain, it moves along at a nice, there are some nice kills, there are a couple of decent mini action scenes including a shoot-out, a speeding runaway car & some cool explosion's, Chucky was a great horror character with bags of personality even back then & as a whole it's passes 90 odd minutes painlessly enough.Director Holland does a good job here & the film has a nice look to it. I'm not sure the film is particularly scary but it has a decent horror atmosphere to it. I was a little disappointed by the kills in Child's Play as well as the lack of them, for some bizarre reason until the recent British DVD Child's Play had always been cut over here in the UK including it's original theatrical run & as usual the extra footage is of no real significance or particularly strong & as a whole the violence & gore quota isn't that high. There are some stabbings & a few splashes of blood here & there but very little else to get excited about. I mean there's nothing here to rival or as memorable as the slit throat from Part 3 or the nails in the face & guy run over by a huge semi-truck & gorily splattered all over the road scenes from Bride of Chucky (1998).With a very healthy sounding budget of about $9,000,000 Child's Play is very well made with good production values. The acting is good & I didn't even find the kid that annoying which is something I suppose...Child's Play is a good horror film I will openly agree with that no problem but I don't see it as any stonewall classic, there are too many silly moments which let the rest of the film down & it could have done with better kills. I don't think I'd watch it again anytime soon. Followed by Child's Play 2 (1990) which I haven't seen, then came Child's Play 3 (1991) which I like & thought was on a par with the original, after a 7 year hiatus came the brilliant Bride of Chucky which breathed new life into the series & following that was the more recent Seed of Chucky (2004) which I haven't got round to watching yet but I do have it in a big pile of DVD's I've brought that one day I get round to seeing...

This was the first time I've watched this movie in ten years. It was a personal favorite when I was younger and I must say the film held up much better than I was expecting it to. I think the film works so well due in large part to director Holland who makes a pretty stylish little film and also manages to make it quite suspenseful in certain areas. The first murder is very well done and Holland keeps it going long enough to make it pretty suspenseful. Another major aspect to the film working is the wonderful special effects bringing the doll to life. This was a low budget film but these effects hold up very well twenty years later. Another added bonus is Hicks who turns in a very good performance as does Vincent as the child. Chris Sarandon adds nice support as the police detective working on the case. I've always felt the film's main problem was the final twenty-minutes where it goes a bit over the top but this remains one of the better horror films of the decade.

That actually might look like a weird and surprising thing to do UNTIL you see the film yourself. Initial skepticism and disbelief is allowed, because this basically is a movie revolving on a murderous doll and hinting at other far-fetched topics, like voodoo and spiritual possession, and such a story is almost impossible to deliver shivers among hardcore horror fanatics. Yet Tom Holland proves that, with the right director's attitude, even the stupidest premise can result in a scary and atmospheric little movie! The elaboration of the script is fully focused on suspense and Holland's solid supervision almost doesn't give you any opportunity to linger over implausible and/or ridiculous elements in the story. This is exactly what distinguishes Child's Play from the majority of lame 80's horror movies&#133; Many of them feature thin and silly story lines, but at least this film doesn't downgrade itself to cheap comedy-standards and actually manages to come across as real horror. Single and constantly struggling mother Karen is absolutely delighted when she manages to buy her 6-year-old son Andy a popular Good Guy-doll at a much cheaper price, but little does she know it's possessed with the malicious spirit of a criminal that got gunned down by Detroit police officer Mike Norris. Even as a cute-looking kid's toy, Charles Lee Ray remains the embodiment of pure evil as he commits gruesome murders and even attempts to transfer his soul into young Andy's body. Naturally, nobody initially believes the child and he's even sent to mental institutions because the authorities think he's a young psychopath who killed the babysitter himself. The freckle-faced doll Chucky is quite an engaging horror villain, made legendary by Brad Dourif's raw voice, and thanks to some really impressive visual effects it looks even more menacing than most fully-grown and anatomically correct serial killers from other 80's horror movies. The highlight-sequences in Child's Play are genuinely creepy, for example when Karen drastically experiences that her son was telling the truth or when Chucky avenges himself on the police detective who shot him. The acting performances are superb (even young Alex Vincent is a revelation) and the amount of witty one-liners is thankfully kept to minimum, unlike in the sequels where they became the franchise's main objective. Highly recommended! "}]
