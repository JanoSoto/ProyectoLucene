It was a cleaner movie, and still an equally entertaining one with a good mix of drama, action, comedy and even some good music thrown in. The film has no lulls and 110 minutes go by pretty quickly.The first half of this movie takes place in New York City, where we last saw Mick Dundee (Paul Hogan). The second half, the crocodile man takes his bride (Linda Kozlowski) back to the outback in Australia. Hogan was never more entertaining and, of course, feeling comfortable back in his home territory.This is just a fun ride all the way and, yes, to use a clich√©, good family entertainment.

What on earth does it take to entertain people these days? The Australian outback's Mick Dundee is surely one of the cinematic world's most charismatic characters and amusing adventurers. Here he's back in a sequel that's every bit as fun as the original tale.The previous movie begins in Australia and then moves to New York. By contrast, as this film opens, Mick is settled in New York with his beautiful journalistic girlfriend, Sue Charlton. However, Sue's ex husband is murdered in Colombia after taking pictures of a drug cartel's dealings. He has sent these photos to Sue, resulting in her being kidnapped by Rico and the other drug hoodlums. Mick must come to her rescue and the pair then head for safety to HIS terrain Down Under, naturally pursued by the gangsters.As in the original, there's plenty of fun in the sequel. Mick's assault on the drug kingpin Rico's house, assisted by a likable but very amateur young gang, makes for some pretty entertaining scenes. Once Down Under, it's non stop pranks cooked up by Mick as he & his 'sheila' traipse around his own bush 'estate', with the urban villains hot on their trail (and often vice versa!). Suffice it to say, some of Mick's crazy antics almost make you feel sorry for the bad guys! Sue Charlton (played by actress Linda Kozlowzki) always looks lovely and perfectly groomed, whatever the bush conditions! Once again, the chemistry between her and Mick sizzles throughout the tale. Mick's bumbling but totally endearing sidekick, Wally, is back and there's also a couple of amusing aboriginal characters. As for Mick himself (actor Paul Hogan), he still has the same charm and affability as in the original. This time he's really having the time of his life with the villains. Don't listen to the naysayers, it's a highly entertaining yarn. The next sequel, Crocodile Dundee in Los Angeles, is definitely watchable...I can never resist Mick...though not quite up to the same standard.

I won't spoil any of the scenes for anyone but they are all great particularly the ones that take place during the last quarter hour. There's also a great scene where Dundee talks to a suicide jumper atop a building. Paul Hogan doesn't do as many films as most actors which I think is better because he only acts in movies that are good.Linda Koslowski is back as Sue Charlton and she does a great job again.

Paul Hogan and Linda Kozlowski return for a second go round of adventures as Australian adventurer Mick Dundee and New York reporter Sue Charlton. This time the movie reverses the original by opening in New York and concluding in Australia. Interesting idea. However, Crocodile Dundee II isn't quite as good as the original. The main problem with this movie is that it isn't as funny as the first film. The second installment has a more serious tone to it, thanks in part to a plot involving drug lords presuing our heroes. The laughs seem to come in few and far between, which wasn't the case with the original. Still, there's lots to like here. Hogan is fine as he was in the first film, as is Kozlowski. There are funny moments in the film, and it has dangerous adventure that keeps the movie entertaining.

The plot is in fact reverse to the original with Aussie Mick Dundee running into trouble when his journalist girlfriend Sue (Linda Koslowski) is kidnapped by an evil drugs baron.  I need to be someone where I can see them coming, the hero exclaims and that can only mean one thing - a return to the bush!  Indeed, the second half of the film in Australia is notably more successful and inventive.  Hogan's screenplay again features a bunch of memorable and exciting moments, whilst the delightful Peter Best score is also retained.   "},{"Title":"Not as Fun as the Original, but Still Worthwhile  (7/10)","Date":"20 September 2002","Score":"10 out of 14 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Adventure, Comedy","Review":"  If you saw the original, this one will seem like a visit with an old friend, that being the likable Mick `Crocodile' Dundee.  This time around there's not as much `whimsy' to it, though, and as things get a bit more heavy-handed, Mick finds himself in some rather murky waters as the story unfolds.  Still, the appeal of the character and the easy, intrinsic humor at the heart of the film is enough to make `Crocodile Dundee II,' directed by John Cornell, a satisfying cinematic experience.As the film opens, Mick (Paul Hogan) is happily ensconced in New York City with his lady-friend, journalist Sue Charlton (Linda Kozlowski), and life is good.  Mick, however, tired of just laying about has decided it's time to seek gainful employment, and sets out to do just that.  His job search gets put on hold, though, when Sue's ex-husband, Bob Tanner (Dennis Boutsikaris), a journalist currently covering a story in South America, sends some photographs he's taken-- the subject of which is of a particularly serious and sensitive nature-- to Sue, and something else arrives along with the them  Trouble.  Trouble, as in the man in the pictures is one `Rico' (Hechter Ubarry), a big time drug dealer who is more than a little concerned about the compromising position these particular photos will undoubtedly put him in.  He will stop at nothing to get them, and he has the `muscle' to do it.  But there's one small item Rico hasn't factored in to his agenda and his plan of attack.  And his name is Mick Dundee.  Written by Paul Hogan and his son, Brett Hogan, this film suffers the `Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom' syndrome, in that-- like the `Indy' film-- it is a sequel to a hugely successful original, and takes that same `turn' toward the dark side.  And in the case of this film, it's even more noticeable inasmuch as this is a comedy rather than a pure action/adventure movie, and-- let's face it-- it's tough to find a light, comedic touch in a film that deals with a kidnapping, killings and drug dealers.  Still, just as Spielberg did with the `Indy' sequel, Hogan pulls it off; and he does it with a winning smile and bit of sleight-of-hand.As the great Steve Allen would say, `All seriousness aside, folks--'  And in a nutshell, that's the trick Hogan, Hogan and Cornell use to make this offering a viable commodity.  Taken out of context, the story alone is serious stuff, more conducive to a `Traffic,' `Blow' or `Scarface' than a `Crocodile Dundee' movie.  But therein is the rub; the filmmakers here take a lighthearted approach to a serious issue, being careful, however, not to discount or be dismissive of it, but rather by toning down the `results' of the violence while infusing it with humor and some genuinely engaging characters, and presenting it all in a way that is palatable to a wide audience.  Cornell, like Peter Faiman (who directed `Crocodile Dundee'), is destined to be the forgotten man of this project, and for the same reasons.  Cornell takes the wheel of the ship here, takes his audience on a cruise then deposits them safely back on shore, where most will agree it was a trip worth taking.  But in the end, there is nothing about it that identifies Cornell; nothing with his `signature' on it.  And, like Faiman, he only directed one other film, `Almost an Angel' in 1990 (also starring Hogan and Kozlowski), which was mediocre at best.  So there's simply nothing to reference him.  He may have been the captain of the ship, and he did a good job, technically speaking, but he kept himself in the wheelhouse too long to be noticed.Hogan, meanwhile, was taking center stage in the lounge, successfully reprising his role as everyones favorite `Aussie.'  Without question, no matter what Paul Hogan does for the rest of his career, this is the character moviegoers everywhere will forever associate him with, and for good reason.  Quite simply, Mick Dundee is just such a likable bloke.  And it's a theme that runs throughout the entire series-- everybody likes him; no matter where he goes or who he meets, he makes them feel as if they've known him all their lives.  He's amiable, good looking, charismatic, and has an entirely non-judgmental, matter-of-fact way of dealing with people and situations that provides a refreshing perspective on the human condition.  That's what makes this character so memorable, and there's no getting around it  Just as Leonard Nimoy will always be `Spock' regardless of whatever else he ever does, Hogan will always be Crocodile Dundee.  Because he IS Mick Dundee.Also in fine form for this second go &#145;round is the beautiful Linda Kozlowski, returning to the role she created in the original, Sue Charlton.  And-- as in the first one-- it's the on screen chemistry between Kozlowski and Hogan that really sells it; whether it's in the Australian outback or on the streets of New York City, they find the magic, and it comes through to the audience, loud and clear.  This isn't, of course, the kind of stuff that wins Oscars, but her performance is honest and convincing, and Kozlowski has a screen presence that is altogether natural and real, all of which makes the relationship between Sue and Mick all the more believable.Also turning in noteworthy performances are John Meillon, returning as Mick's friend and business associate, Walter Reilly; Charles Dutton as the street wise Leroy; and Ubarry, who makes Rico the bad guy you love to hate. The supporting cast includes Juan Fernandez (Miguel), Kenneth Welsh (Brannigan), Ernie Dingo (Charlie), Luis Guzman (Jose), Jace Alexander (Rat) and Steve Rackman (Donk).  An entertaining film, but not nearly as `fun' as the original (the `Indy' syndrome, again), `Crocodile Dundee II' is nevertheless a worthy addition to the series, as it puts you together with one of the screen's most unforgettable characters, `Crocodile' Dundee.  7/10.

I think I actually quite enjoyed this the first time I seen it, but even then I knew something wasn't quite right. Actually watching it now the first thing that strikes me about Crocodile Dundee II is that while the first one was a Romantic Comedy, in the sequel there is almost no romance, fair enough because Mick and Sue are together now, but there is nowhere near enough comedy. Its basically an adventure movie and is pretty good taken as such. I just wish they could have got a little more comedy in there too. I recently watched Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade and that film had more laughs than this one, and that film is more of an action adventure than a comedy.

Yep, the inevitable sequel to the original hit and to be fair, I have no qualms about it. The first film was a breathe of fresh air and managed to capture the fun spirit of old fashioned adventures with a charming hero perfectly.This film did well upon release but got bad reviews, I don't really see why to be honest. Sure the plot is a bit textbook, daft and over used, but the whole idea of the Aussie bushman still trying to find his way around the modern big city of New York with its cultural differences, lingo difficulties and his general ignorance of anything outside of the outback is still just about amusing.Can't deny that there are moments when your thinking surely he's heard of that before! or seen one of those!. When Mick fails to pick up on a Richard Nixon impression and then admits he's never heard of Nixon...yeah OK you've been living in the wilds of Oz but SURELY you've heard of Nixon! come on!.The main let down for this film is the stupid ass plot. Its basically your standard baddies kidnap Dundee's girl and he's gotta save her. This incorporates much silly nonsense involving kiddie street gangs dressed in awful 80's 'gangwear' helping Dundee out, its lame.The second half of the plot (two halves just like the first film) sees Dundee and Jane...I mean 'Sue Charlton' back in native Oz hiding out from the bad guys who are now after them for revenge. All that way just for revenge? is it that important?. Anyway we are then given an overly long series of chase/hunt sequences where Dundee uses his bushman talents to defeat the bad guys one by one.Kinda got the impression that the despite the fact the first film was a big success it didn't involve any violence or bad guys for Dundee to kill, and this is why we have this bog standard sequel storyline. First film was a nice romantic Prince Charming type story, this is Hollywood action time...Aussie style. What's even more off putting is both Dundee and Sue are in mortal danger during this time from the drug dealers hunting them yet they treat it like some kind of happy camping trip with lots of hugs n kisses. The director can't decide what he wants, remain a lovey dovey romcom or venture into some proper jungle/desert killing action. Obviously it stays on the light side which equals some rather silly tame bad guy take downs which aren't really believable for the situation. The situation quite clearly shows that all the bad guys need to be killed off.So yeah the story is crap and that's a shame because the franchise is fine for a sequel. There is just enough juice left in Mick Dundee to squeeze out another fun film. The visuals gags are still keeping afloat just about, Hogan still looks the part perfectly as do all other cast members (great continuity) and the imagery of wild Australia in all its glory with the adding of more Aboriginal folk is still very welcome and quite original. But most importantly, overall its still a fun film that just about delivers...by the skin of its teeth. 6/10 "},{"Title":"The magic's gone","Date":"21 July 2013","Score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Adventure, Comedy","Review":" Paul Hogan's love of his Mick Dundee character can't overcome the redundancy of this sequel, which has none of the charm, laughs or easygoing nature of the original film.

Everything that made the first film work is pushed aside in favour of this desperate plot. Where's the inventive dialogue and smart humour of the first movie?

Journalist (Kozlowski) has stumbled onto something big in the drug empire, or has shot too much. She's kidnapped by a Columbian drug-lord, Juan Fernandez, who better for the role, as we've seen him real slimy scum sucking other roles.

This time the formula is reversed as Mick Dundee (Paul Hogan) is forced to take his lady, Sue Charlton (Linda Kozlowski), back to the wilds of Australia in order to protect her from gangsters. There, Mick, with all his Outback skills, starts to pick the gangsters off one by one.Nah. I don't need a gun. I got a Donk!Within the plot structure there are numerous occasions for Dundee inspired jokes and scenarios, where although they are not as strong as in the first movie, they are amusing and not straining for the laugh factor. The genuine chemistry between real life couple Hogan and Kozlowski is evident and keeps the film grounded in warmth. Hogan is such a likable guy, he's a natural at playing the rugged adventurer type, and it's his charisma that rightly drives the picture forward. He throws a great punch as well, very believable.Returning characters like Wally and Donk are reassuring presences, while Charles Dutton as Leroy Brown provides solid comedy foil for Dundee during the New York part of the plot. The Northern Territory of Australia is once again the visual bonus (cinematography again by Russell Boyd), though we never really get the sweeping shots the setting deserves, and Peter Best once again provides an appropriate musical score for the two continent setting without pushing anything new on us. Problems elsewhere? There's a raft of stereotypes, particularly with the Ernie Dingo led villains, while the unoriginality of the story (a rehash of the first film) is a touch frustrating.Not exactly great and not deserving of the ill advised second sequel that followed 13 years later, part 2 of Mick and Sue's adventures is none the less still a fun way to spend an afternoon. 6.5/10 "},{"Title":"Crocodile Dundee II (1988) Not As Good As First Crocodile Dundee Movie Due To Writing Problems In Part Two.","Date":"1 April 2013","Score":"","Genre":"Action, Adventure, Comedy","Review":" Crocodile Dundee II (1988) Not As Good As First Crocodile Dundee Movie Due To Writing Problems In Part Two.The first Crocodile Dundee (1986) movie was a wonderful comedy.The second Crocodile Dundee (1988) movie was intended to cash in on the first movie, which it probably did....it probably made much more money for the owners of the movie than the first movie did.Nobody expected the first movie to be a big hit. Everybody expected the second movie to be a hit, and movie owners could (probably did) cut great deals with movie house owners, television presentation people, and sellers of VHS and DVD home videos.The second movie made the owners much richer than the first movie did.But.........sadly, it wasn't (isn't) as good a movie as the first one.Old story with comedies of fame...going back to The Thin Man (1934) which was a big, unexpected hit when it first came out, and resulted in many sequels, none as good as the first movie.There are exceptions to the rule that follow-up movies are never as good as initial movies....Godfather II (1974) is an example.An example closer to home is the original Johnny Weismuller Tarzan (1932) movie which was followed up by an even better Tarzan sequel titled Tarzan And His Mate (1934 which co-starred the lovely Maureen O'Sullivan (Mia Farrow's mother!) who swam totally nude with her handsome husband, Johnny Weismuller as Tarzan in a sort of underwater ballet quite breathtaking to see, and quite tasteful, nude though the dancers were in pre-code 1934 times.Crocodile Dundee (1986) is sometimes compared to Tarzan's New York Adventure (1942) which uses the same jokes......yokel Tarzan from darkest Africa comes to NYC, dresses up in tuxedos, goes to night clubs, rides subways, and doesn't fit in....very funny! The owners of the Crocodile Dundee movie series would have done well to pattern the second Crocodile Dundee II (1988) movie after Tarzan And His Mate (1934) and could have made a much better movie if they followed the Tarzan And His Mate (1934) example (BTW, Tarzan And His Mate 1934 is honored by inclusion on the Library Of Congress National Film Registry List....best best movies list of all, to my thinking...and the first Tarzan Johnny Weismuller movie isn't!).Linda Kozlowski, a lovely, Julliard NYC Drama School graduate of both high acting talent and skills (and also very pretty in her 20's in the 1980's) could have done much more than she did in the Crocodile Dundee II (1988) movie, where she and Paul Hogan are already mated and committed, and there is no more electricity based on courtship and the chase seen in the first movie.Oh well........we are too soon old and too late smart and so is Hollywood (including the Australia part of Hollywood responsible for the Crocodile Dundee movies).Here are reasons the first Crocodile Dundee (1986), aka Part One, is better than the second one Part One (1986) showed a fish out of water pretty girl reporter (Linda Kozlowski) in Australia, and then a fish out of water Australian comic male hero (Paul Hogan) trying to survive in the New York City of the mid-1980's.Part One worked because it presented non-stop fish out of water jokes and situations all well acted by Hogan and Kozlowski.Part One wasn't serious and didn't try to be.Great photography of rural Australia and of up-scale New York City and suburbs.Part One made fun of strange types in both settings, and the main actors did a good job as comics reacting to the strange types.Good enough.The Part One movie was a hit.Part Two wasn't as good because it tried to get serious, got away from the main value of Part One, which was that both rural Australia and New York City of the 1980's are strange for people there for the first time reacting to all they see and must put up with.Part Two was an imperfect action movie, not as good as Tom Cruise, Harrison Ford, Pierce Brosnan, Matt Damon, Bruce Willis, Sean Connery, Clint Eastwood, Jason Statham, etc. etc. movies, and not as funny as the first Crocodile Dundee (1986) movie.Neither Paul Hogan nor his leading lady from Part One, Linda Kozlowski have the chance to show their stuff as they did often in Part One (showing their stuff was what made the first movie a big hit).Paul Hogan and Linda Kozlowski are good actors, but the writing of Part Two just wasn't as good or on the mark as was the writing for Part One.Sadly, this is a common story regarding sequels trying to cash in on big initial hit movies, but slowed down because sequels become committee projects always less likely have singular vision of the sort which makes initial hit movies good, but hard to duplicate when committees take over.---------------------- Tex (David) Allen is a SAG-AFTRA east coast movie actor who has written almost 100 movie reviews for both the Amazon and IMDb databases.More about Tex Allen at the IMDb website.See IMDb database for details about Tex (David) Allen.Send emails to Tex Allen to TexAllen@Rocketmail.Com "}{"Title":"Typical Sequel,","Date":"3 March 2013","Score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Adventure, Comedy","Review":" Crocodile Dundee 2 is a good enough with a decent story line,a fairly good cast and some funny parts,I wasn't that fund of the first Crocodile Dundee,but this one definitely isn't as good,its a typical comedy sequel,the story is unusual compared to the original,but Paul Hogan still make enjoyment of the movie with his performance being as good as ever,but fans of the original will definitely be disappointed by this sequel.Sue,now married to Mick 'Crocodile' Dundee,is kidnapped by gangsters involved in a drug baron,and its upto Crocodile Dundee to save his wife.-6/10-DILLON HARRIS "},{"Title":"Mediocre film carried on the shoulders of Hogan","Date":"3 November 2010","Score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Adventure, Comedy","Review":" Crocodile Dundee was kinda smart.

Paul Hogan is back as Mick 'Crocodile' Dundee, apparently settled into his life of domesticity in NYC. He still feeds the animal within occasionally - our first glimpse of him is fishing in New York harbour with explosives - and he yearns for home intermittently, but his choice to stay in American is driven by his relationship with Kozlowski's Sue Charlton, still the high flying reporter. Charton's ex, spurned in the first movie upon the arrival of Dundee, is doing some reporting of his own in Columbia, and manages to take some photographs of notorious drug trafficker Luis Rico executing a man which, inevitably, puts his life in jeopardy. In desperation, he mails the shots to Charlton and she in turn is kidnapped. Can Mick save her from the clutches of the evil drug-lord? And will the drug-lord be able to survive in the wilderness of The Outback? The answers to both questions are obvious, but it matters not. Again, Hogan is on fine form as the likable Dundee, a genuinely warm character that you can't help but be engaged by. Kozlowski plays well against him, and their off screen romance only adds to the on screen chemistry. The plot is pretty redundant, though it is effective in drawing Mick back to his homeland in order to turn the tables on those who would endanger him and his belle. Though not quite as captivating as the first movie, this is nevertheless a way above average eighties comedy classic.

"},{"Title":"Not the Second Great Australian Comedy","Date":"26 March 2005","Score":"","Genre":"Action, Adventure, Comedy","Review":" After his great success with Crocodile Dundee, Paul Hogan seemed to be on top of the world. For anyone in that position, as Tim Rice reminded us in the lyrics to Evita, the most important question is Where do you go from here? For any film-maker in the Eighties who had just had a success, there was an obvious answer to that question; you made a sequel. This was the golden age of the sequel; any successful film was liable to be followed up not just by a single sequel but by a whole series of them. This became something of a joke; comedians used to speculate whether we would see a Superman VII, a Rocky X or a Friday the 13th Part 13. Such long-running series became known as franchises, a name which emphasised the commerciality of the enterprise, as though making a film was the same as running a McDonald's restaurant.There was, however, a problem with Crocodile Dundee. The original film, although it also contained elements of satire, was essentially a romantic comedy. This is a type of film particularly difficult to follow up with a sequel because falling in love is, generally speaking, something that most couples only do once. The Philadelphia Postscript? Lunch at Tiffany's? The Postgraduate? The Second Time Harry Met Sally? A Fifth Wedding and Another Funeral? Just a few of the follow-ups to classic rom-coms that never got made. This being the Eighties, however, a sequel to Crocodile Dundee was unavoidable, but Paul Hogan obviously recognised the problem as Crocodile Dundee II was made in a quite different style to the original, being an adventure comedy rather than a romantic comedy.At the beginning of the film, Mick Dundee is living in New York with his girlfriend Sue. Sue's ex-husband Bob is working as an investigative journalist in Colombia, helping to expose the local involvement in the drug trade. Unfortunately his cover is blown and he is murdered by the traffickers, but not before he has mailed Sue a roll of film incriminating Luis Rico, one of the wealthiest and most powerful dealers. Rico kidnaps Sue in an attempt to recover the evidence; Mick manages to free her from Rico's mansion with the aid of a local street gang. The scene then shifts to Australia. (This reverses the pattern of the first film, which starts in Australia and then moves to America). Mick has taken Sue back to his home town of Walkabout Creek in the Northern Territory, thinking she will be safer there. Rico, however, tracks them down, and Mick and Sue disappear into the bush with the drug dealer and his gang in pursuit. Mick must use his skills as a tracker and his knowledge of the outback in order to outwit the villains.The film does not come close to achieving the success of its predecessor because, although some of the elements- Hogan's larger-than-life comic character, the beauty of Linda Kozlowski as Sue, Mick's bumbling, timid friend Walt- that made the original film such a success are present, others are not. The first film succeeded largely because of a combination of romance and satire. Not only is the element of romance played down in the sequel, but much of the satire is also lacking. Most of the humour in the original arose from Mick's innocent reactions to the unfamiliar ways of the big city. In the sequel, he has been living in New York for some time and is consequently more street-smart- and less funny. There are some amusing scenes, such as the one in which he prevents a suicide from throwing himself off a high-rise building, but not many.The scenes of adventure in the bush never generate much excitement. Mick's knowledge of bushcraft and aboriginal lore are so superior to those of pursuers that we never experience any anxiety on his behalf or doubt that he will triumph over them. The original Crocodile Dundee was, in my view, the first great Australian screen comedy. The sequel, although it is amiable and entertaining enough, is definitely not the second. 6/10 "},{"Title":"A good flick forever cursed as a sequel","Date":"21 October 2003","Score":"","Genre":"Action, Adventure, Comedy","Review":"  Superior to the delightful original, Crocodile Dundee II ought to be judged on its own merits and not simply as a 'sequel'.The first installment -- though funny and well done -- was nevertheless based on the tired country-bumpkin-goes-to-big-city-and-falls-for-metropolitan-sophisticate theme.  This movie builds on that groundwork and takes the main characters (the earthwise Mick and the streetwise Sue) in an altogether different direction.The hugely successful original film's main deficiency, in my opinion, was its one-sided quality.  Crocodile Dundee II combines many different and suspenseful elements, such as the crime underworld and kidnapping; yet it remains as funny as the first.This movie also gives us a chance to see some real up-and-comers of today's entertainment as they appeared several years ago in these minor roles (just check out the cast of characters).Although the ending is kind of saccharine, Crocodile Dundee II remains a top choice for brightening up a boring evening or weekend afternoon.  Regrettably, it will always be in the shadow of the first as a 'sequel'.

It's hard not to have a certain sense of curiosity about a country that has the same land mass as the entire USA, but only has about the same number of people spread through it as there are in New York City.However, by highlighting how less than ten percent of the Australian population lived at the time, both Paul Hogan and the Australian Tourist Board saddled the country with the image of being stuck back in some relative dark age. Which is a real shame considering that some of the most wonderful medical breakthroughs are thought up first by Australian scientists who live in those cities like Sydney or Melbourne that really resemble New York on a smaller scale.But this is a little beside the point. Even though this fault was subtly rectified in the third installment, by projecting something that has nothing in common with most of the Australian population to the rest of the world, Hogan had succeeded in alienating his core audience. That was mistake number one on this film. The next mistake was trying to do too much in this sequel, or rather taking too long to do it. While the amount of pursuit in the film is about half as any other pursuit-oriented film such as Hard Target or The Terminator, it is spread out over the same amount of running time (or even 13 minutes more in the former case) and very slowly-paced to boot.And that, in a nutshell, is the big problem. There's no excitement, and no tension. It is basically a bunch of people walking around New York City and occasionally stopping to move the plot forward, then a bunch of people walking around the Northern Territory, stopping every now and again to do something that cannot really be described in words. Sure, there are interesting moments such as the telephone call, or when Ernie Dingo jokingly tells Linda Koslowski that his fellow aborigine just asked if they're allowed to eat their prisoners, but a few minutes of hilarity in two hours of travelogue does not a great film make.If you've seen the first one, skip this one and just go to the third film, which almost pretends this one doesn't exist anyway.

She is eventually kidnapped and held hostage but Dundee saves the day aided by Leroy Brown and his gang. They will eventually head back to Australia because the movie completely lacks any originality. Good photography cannot blindside the fact that this is just a predictable rehash. Director John Cornell manages to make the Australian night sequences effectively haunting but his screenplay is uninspiring. Hogan created Mick Dundee as an interesting case study of humour and culture but here he is basically reciting and so is Kozlowski as his damsel wife. Charles S. Dutton plays the standard issue Leroy Brown. He is amusing but perhaps had the spotlight been on him then maybe there would be something to be benefited. The one role that stood out positively is John Meillon as a friend of Mick's. The role isn't overly broad but he brings humour particularly during a small plot turn involving him aiming a gun at what he believes is the right target.

The problem with this Crocodile Dundee is that the movie feels like it is being shoved down your throat and the whole thing looks coins the phrase, We have seen it all before. The movie wasn't half bad it just had no point everything that happened practically had no purpose, and when something has no purpose it is just a waste.The acting here is no better than the first, but now that we are all familiar with the Dundee charm, the writers decided to take him back to outback Australia so that we can see the bushman in him. This was suppose to bring in more action like adventure into the whole movie package, but what it just did was fill up so many minutes with unrealistic action scenes that you feel like fast forwarding to the whole thing.The comedy here was out of sync; the whole idea of pairing Dundee with a Colombian drug lord and making the drug lord and his men look like just pure miscreants is not my idea of a well thought out antagonist. The movie lacked a lot of life and the makers decided to do a reverse, the setting started out in New York City then Dundee and Sue went to Australia a familiar turf for Dundee while he dealt with the bad guys.The movie plot is about our duo love birds Dundee (Paul Hogan) and Sue (Linda Kozlowski) who get mixed up with a Colombian drug lord, who had his picture taken when he killed someone by Sue's ex husband. The ex then sent the film to Sue and the drug dealer found out then kidnapped Sue, all for him to find out that Dundee had the film.Now Dundee has to find a way to stay alive and save the love of his life.The movie was not a critical success but it was a huge commercial success, the $15.8 million production cost brought in over $239 million dollars, and it kept the Dundee name on our lips for a while, and making Hogan richer. But then the producers felt like milking the franchise some more so 13 years later in 2001 a new Dundee film was done starring also Hogan and Kozlowski, the new film failed both critically and commercially.So after you are done watching the first Crocodile Dundee you may be tempted to see this misfit, so if you get the chance maybe you should.

Now Kozlowski is in danger as she has the evidence and it is up to the titled character (Paul Hogan) to save the day. Going back to Australia for safety purposes looks to be the best solution, but what happens when the bad guys give chase, kidnap Hogan's best friend (John Meillon) and threaten Hogan and Kozlowski's very lives? Silly sequel tries to get cute with an action story while the basis for the original worked because there really was no story, just quirky situations. Hogan's talents are wasted and the rest of the cast seems lost in the dizzying mess. Watch for future reputable performers Charles Dutton and Luis Guzman in small roles. 2 stars out of 5.

Basically Australian crocodile hunter Michael J. Crocodile Dundee (Paul Hogan) has stayed and continued to try and adapt to life in New York since falling in love with journalist Sue Charlton (Linda Kozlowski). Some gangsters have been pursuing Sue after her ex-husband photographer Bob Tanner (Dennis Boutsikaris) took photos of a brutal crime he witnessed, and he sent them to her. Crime boss Luis Rico (Hechter Ubarry) and his associates are holding Sue against her will, and Mick is determined to get her back no matter what, and he has some unlikely friends to help. When she is rescued, Mick decides it is a good idea to protect Sue by taking her home to Australia, but of course Rico and the gang track them down to try and get their own way. In the end, the gangsters are defeated, and Mick and Sue are safe and sound thanks to his skills of the outback, and that is where they stay. Also starring John Meillon as Walter Reilly, Juan Fern√°ndez as Miguel, Ernie Dingo as Charlie, Steve Rackman as Donk, Gerry Skilton as Nugget, Gus Mercurio as Frank, Jim Holt as Erskine, Alec Wilson as Denning, Maggie Blinco as Ida and Luis Guzm√°n as Jose. Hogan is once again a nice friendly character, but he does show a slightly aggressive side using weapons, and Kozlowski, who married Hogan two years later, is still good too, the story is rather patchy, the kidnap ans rescue plot is alright, and the stuff that happens in Australia is not bad, it is not as good as the first film, but it's not such a terrible comedy adventure. Okay!

I agree the story is predictable, parts of the comedy don't quite work and the film is overlong. But... there are entertaining parts, especially Paul Hogan's outback approach to urban life, Hogan is every bit as likable as he was in the first film, the scenery and photography are excellent, the direction is solid on the most part and I think if there is something it improves on from the original it is brisker in pace than the first was. Linda Kozslowski is nice too. So overall, not as good as the first but entertaining and better than the third by a landslide. 7/10 Bethany Cox "},{"Title":"Inevitable sequel is moderately entertaining","Date":"10 October 2007","Score":"0 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Adventure, Comedy","Review":" The inevitable sequel to the 1986 box office smash is also inevitably a step down.

The first succeeded in much the same manner as Home Alone a slow build-up but since we all know there's fun toward the end, we tolerate it. Here, the best parts are exhausted early.Mick 'Crocodile' Dundee (Hogan) is now a New York resident (or overstayer without a visa?) and while he still handles certain things in an Outback way (fishing using dynamite, sleeping on the floor), his character begins being more acclimatized to life in the Big Apple. On the plus side, the writers have avoided repeating the jokes.Not that there are too many new jokes. We're left puzzled where the wit of the 1970s Hogan &#150; and I'm including those beer ads he did in the UK &#150; has gone here. Whereas the first was clearly a comedy, 'Crocodile' Dundee II is more of an action-adventure, taking the audience on an America-to-Australia journey so that Hogan can indulge a more Indiana-Jonesey role. Laughs are minimal in this Hollywood sequel seemingly developed for American tastes and mostly lacking Australiana.With the America-to-Australia storyline it would have been a great opportunity to use Koslowski's character more greatly for comedy, showing how an American abroad would cope in the Outback. I'm sure the Hogans would have had more than a few stories to spin.By ending in Australia with some action sequences, Hogan gets to be the bush hero and win the day, but consequently the charm of the Australian abroad is forgotten as the film ends.

Don't you have the gut instinct that the producers grabbed the nearest script lying around ( Which was obviously a screenplay intended for either Bruce or Arnie ) and got someone to write a few scenes involving the eponymous character of CROCODILE DUNDEE ? For much of the running time you get the feeling you're watching two entirely unconnected movies , one being a violent thriller about a nasty bunch of drug lords who kidnap somebody's wife and kill anyone who stand in their way and a comedy film starring Paul Hogan as an innocent abroad. The two movies seem to clash with one another and we're treated to implausible plot twists as the screenplay tries to merge the two stories in a very unsuccessful manner .CROCODILE DUNDEE 2 isn't a terrible movie but it is a bizarre one because of the reasons I've outlined .

Like most sequels this one was trying desperately to outdo the first. Scenes and lines were clearly put in to invoke laughter from the audience. One thing I did find interesting was the hypocritical nature of the Linda Kozlowski character Sue Charlton. In the first film when Mick encounters the guest snorting cocaine he asks Charlton what the person was doing. She then (with a somewhat aglow expression on her face) gives him a quick explanation of cocaine and its benefits.  In this film she loathes and despises a drug dealer who for all practical purposes supplies the very drug that she seemed to think was a good thing in the first. The final shot is about as corny as can be. After all they were like that when the first one ended.

It fails at doing that, too.If nothing else, it started Luis Guzman's career.

The other reviewer rightfully trashes this sequel to the first Crocodile Dundee, but makes the unbelievable assertion that the first movie was one of the freshest and funniest comedies ever--'struth! Sure, I was amused by Crocodile Dundee when it first came out in 1986, but then again, I enjoyed a lot of films when I first saw them twenty to thirty years ago. Watching the first installment again last week, I was genuinely shocked to see just how poorly Crocodile Dundee has aged. The movie was flat, slow, and completely unoriginal, and the acting, particularly that of Linda Koslowski, was atrocious. Even the lines I remembered finding so witty, like the bit about the lens cap being left on the camera, were embarrassingly cheesy and poorly delivered. Both of the first two Dundee movies seem to have been directed by a marsupial after one too many Foster's. In truth, the sequel wasn't nearly as disappointing as it might have been had the first film been any good. The best thing about both films is the location filming that shows New York as it used to be. All I can say is, as bad as so many movies today are, and as much as special effects, attractive but empty actors, and hype have taken over Hollywood, we really need to check reality before we start pining for the good old days of the 1980s film world. If you really want to wax nostalgic about movie-making, go back to the 30s and 40s and see just how far we haven't come. "}]
