Since other posters have commented extensively on this movie, I'll limit myself to a few comments about those elements others have not addressed.In it my understanding from material I read at the time the movie was in release (I saw it in Los Angeles when I was living there in the late 80s) that the actors who portrayed Afghanis learned and delivered their lines phonetically.  The fact that the Russians sound like Americans, and the Afghans are speaking the language without subtitles is a brilliant dramatic device.  Virtually no one is going to understand what the Afghanis are actually saying, but it is possible to get the gist from the context and from body language.  This has the effect of alienating the viewer from the freedom fighters and making them tend to identify with the Russian tank crew.  The movie then operates subversively against this natural tendency throughout the remainder of the story.The hunting of the tank by the Mujahadeen has an almost mythic quality, except for the fact that the T-62 is real and it has a human crew.  And leading that crew is the tank commander whose entire life was shaped by his experiences in The Great Patriotic War against the Nazis when, as an 8-year-old, he was used by Russian troops in Stalingrad to help kill German tanks.  The commander is as monomaniacal as Ahab, but instead of pursuing the whale, he is it's animating spirit.There are a lot of layers to this movie -- it will definitely repay repeat viewings.

This film is not critical of the Mujahadeen, but rather shows them struggling to fight for their freedom. The Soviet army is the oppressive evil presence. This film was made during the Cold War, when Americans saw a line drawn in the sand between communism and capitalist democracy. In the film, the Soviets are clearly the bad guys, and the Mujahadeen are fighting the good fight. The main character comes to understand this during the film, finally telling his Soviet commanding officer that we're the Nazis this time.During the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, the United States funded, supplied, and trained Mujahadeen forces. American stinger missiles were used to shoot down Soviet helicopters. The most famous Mujahadeen fighter trained by the United States would come to be Osama bin Laden. He would participate in the fight against the Soviet army, much to the approval of the United States. This film pays tribute to the Mujahadeen for valiantly defending themselves against America's enemy. The fact that the United States has invaded Afghanistan makes the film much more interesting to watch. It is ironic that these militants once praised by Hollywood are now our enemies. The lesson this film should teach us now, albeit inadvertently, is that we should be careful who we glorify and who we vilify. Humans will be humans, and will fight for what they *believe* is right, sometimes whether it actually is right or not.

Reynolds captures the essence of man's struggle with right & wrong, good & evil, on several levels in this realistic depiction of the Soviet-Afghan conflict. It was both meaningful and entertaining. I gave it an 8.The internal conflicts of the characters reflect the many ways that people reconcile and deal with their emotions and beliefs vis-Ã -vis the roles thrust upon them by war and duty- the soldier, the faithful, the victim, the oppressor, the revenge-seeker and the order-follower. Each main character struggles at some point with his or her decisions in the face of right and wrong, duty and morality. It is the results of these choices that guide the film to transcend the events of war, and delve into the universal questions of how and why man struggles with real and painful choices.Although the film does prove to be quite predictable, the underlying messages are timeless and well depicted. A moving story with good character development artistically filmed and approached realistically. The brutality and violence of war is not gratuitous, and the anti-war message is delivered superbly.I highly recommend this film to all audiences... not just war-film buffs. With the US presence in Afghanistan today, the film should serve to help understand that conflict and this one in regards to the human components that are so often overlooked.A note regarding other user's comments The film was subtitled. It seems that some saw it without the subtitles for some reason. If you are one of those people, you really must view it with them. Rent it. I cannot imagine truly understanding the full scope of the film without the benefit of the Afghan dialog. Also, the Americanization of the soviet dialog not only serves to draw parallels between that conflict and the Vietnam War, but it universalizes the struggles of war and allows the viewer to empathize on a human level- not just a political one. In our long human history, how often have these basic human conflicts occurred... particularly in times of war and oppression and injustice?

There aren't really much movies played in a tank, but this one is and pretty realistic (other than Rambo where he drives, en shoots with a tank = impossible). The claustrophobic effect is nice portrayed like the u-boat movie Das Boot.But this movie is more than another war-movie, it has more levels. The differences of opinion between two men in a tank crew shows parallels with Platoon. The country loyal, but ruthless Russian commander is like the Barnes character of Platoon. And the Elias side, the more human character is played by the tank driver, probably the most intelligent person on the tank, who despises the cruel decisions of the tank commander and questions the motive of the Russian government, and the stress and tension in the tank rises to boiling point, not helped by the constant thread of the Afghan mujahedin.Eventually the driver gets more and more respect for the mujahedin. Like a kind of happens in Lawrence of Arabia or Dances with Wolves. This Afghan warriors are hopelessly out gunned, with only horses and old guns, it's really David against Goliath. This group (with it's leader surprisingly played by Scarface's sidekick Steve Bauer) is also divided, as one part are only interested in money and equipment.Excellent and underrated war-movie, I suspect the title is not chosen wisely.

The film is tragic, exciting, suspenseful, and intelligent. From detailed depictions of the Soviet military to the rare glimpse inside the Afghan social structure, this film takes the viewer to places that few films have ever dared to venture. The film is compelling on many levels, and it will stick with you for a long time after you see it.The film centers around a five-man Soviet tank crew hopelessly lost in Afghanistan after taking part in a vicious raid on a tiny village. The survivors of the village vow to chase this tank to the edge of the earth in order to achieve badal, which is a fancy word for revenge. Steven Bauer (of Scarface fame) plays their young leader. The tank crew is led by a hard-nosed commander who would seemingly trade the lives of his crew for the safety of his tank. He's played by a slimmed-down George Dzundza who you may recognize, but not be able to name the other films he's been in. (Deer Hunter, No Mercy are a couple of them.) Also on board is an idealistic young driver played by Jason Patric. He and the commander are at odds from the very beginning, and that conflict takes a turn you would never guess at the film's outset. The tank crew and those in pursuit have numerous skirmishes as the film plays out. The film is so well-crafted that the viewer can emphasize with whatever characters are in the camera lens. We know the Soviets are pigs for the way they have behaved during their invasion, but it's amazing to see what the commander will come up with next to keep the tank running fast enough to keep them just ahead of the rebels who are hot on their tail. Scene after scene punctuates the tragic human cost of such an invasion, and the devastated lives left in its wake. The film is extraordinarily violent. Director Kevin Reynolds leaves nothing to the imagination regarding the brutality of the Soviet invaders, and the destruction that their weapons have brought to Afghanistan. The film is technically astounding in many respects. Filmed in Israel, the vast desert landscape is a beautiful but desperate backdrop for a film about the savagery of military conflict. I'll bet you won't be able to get some of the violent images out of your head for days after seeing this film. Nor will you be unable to imagine yourself in the shoes of the tank crew completely cut off from help and at the mercy of a merciless commander and an unforgiving desert. George Dzundza walks away with the film from an acting perspective. How about his line regarding their standing orders once the tank has been disabled by the rebels? As he passes out grenades to the remaining crew members he utters the unforgettable dogma Out of commission, become a pillbox; out of ammo, become a bunker out of time, become heroes....See this film. 9 of 10 stars.The Hound.

The conflict here is totally between a group of local Afghan mujahideen and the crew of a lost Soviet tank struggling to find their way out of a valley in which they're trapped. (The image of the lost tank may well be a symbolic representation of the wider war - the Soviet Union being hopelessly lost in Afghanistan.) The movie features a fairly graphic portrayal of the horrors of the battle from the point of view of both sides, as well as of the growing weariness of the Soviets, who - with the exception of their gung-ho and somewhat insane commander - want nothing more than to get out of this country as fast as possible. The mood of the movie is complemented perfectly by the starkness of the desert landscape. Opening with an example of an atrocity by the tank crew against the inhabitants of a small Afghan village, the movie follows the mujahideen as they seek revenge against their invaders.The performances in this movie were absolutely first-rate, headed by a fantastic piece of work by George Dzundza as the insane commander Daskal, who willingly kills his own men if he takes a dislike to them and who refuses a chance to escape via a Soviet helicopter that chances upon the lost crew, choosing instead to get out with his tank and his crew. Jason Patric was equally good as Koverchenko, a member of the tank crew who finally turns against Daskal, and eventually finds himself aligned with the mujahideen in a quest for his own personal revenge against Daskal.The Russians in this movie speak English (thankfully without fake accents) while the Afghans speak whatever their particular native language is with subtitles, which suggests to me that the Russians (and how they respond to their increasingly hopeless situation) are the focal point of the movie. I approach this type of movie with a bit of a grain of salt. American movies that depicted the Soviet Union in the 1980's tended to be a little bit over the top in their portrayal of the Soviet Union as Ronald Reagan's evil empire. Still, there's no doubt that the Soviet invasion and occupation of Afghanistan was a rather brutal affair, and this seemed a not unreasonable depiction of it. Truly one of the better war movies I've ever seen. 9/10 "},{"Title":"A well crafted and beautifully stylized film with a great story slightly marred by some unlikely elements","Date":"13 March 2003","Score":"8 out of 9 people found the following review useful","Genre":"War","Review":"  I found this movie on DVD for five dollars in the bargain bin at Walmart and thought it looked interesting.

This film revolves around the story of five Russians whose tank is separated from the others when the Soviet Union invades Afghanistan in 1981.  The commander of the tank is a cruel and ruthless man played by George Dzunda.  ************Possible Spoilers Ahead*************************** Jason Patric portrays a tank man who  begins to despise the cruelty of his commander and question the purpose of the invasion.  The commander shoots one of the men in the back and claims he was a traitor.  There is infighting and even hatred amongst the four remaining men on the tank.  The men need to get their tank through a pass to escape Afghanistan and get back to the safety of Russia.  The tension mounts as the Afghans close in on them with the intent of destroying the Soviet tank. The contempt the 'tank men' have for each other intensifies and betrayal and death ensue.********* I was pleasantly surprised by The Beast  It is first rate entertainment.  However, please be forewarned that it does have a couple of scenes which are not for the squeamish and the cruelty which the Russians display when they invade an Afghan village in the opening scenes are tough to watch.  On the other hand, the photography is breathtaking and I was vividly transported to the rugged terrain of Afghanistan while watching this film.  I don't know how else to describe the camera work on this film other than liquid and  silky smooth.  It stood out so much that I must comment on the skill of it.  The acting was almost uniformly great, with perhpas one exception of Stephen Baldwin which was just ok.  George Dzundza, Jason Patric and Steven Bauer each had full command of their characters and made them believable, with Dzundza and Patric being the standouts.  You should be aware, however, that the likelihood of this story occurring exactly as it was told, especially some of the dialogue between the tank men and the basically liberal American reasoning of Patric's character seem extremely unlikely.

Although he isn't Russian and had little respect (as most Latvians) to soviets, he's never disrespected his army fellows or combating officers.Starting action was pretty made up as well, as for village blowing purposes soviets would use choppers not tanks. Tanks was used in protecting roads and securing routes. Operatons was mainly carried out by solders and armored vehicles - BTR's. Tanks could be used as support, but there is no way massive tank attack would be enforced without commandos on foot or vehicles guarding them as it was shown (well, armament has always been a virtue for soviet commanders not soldiers).But as I already said, in general this movie is totally worth to see.

And what these nomadic soldiers didn't expected was that an Soviet soldier would help them in this mission.The Soviet side is led by Daskal (George Dzundza in a non typical role of bad guy) an tyrannical commander leading a minor group of men in the desert trying to reach Kandahar. After a group of people of a small attack his tank he and his soldiers capture a man and kill him by running over with the tank. In his crew there's two noble souls an Afghan translator (Erick Avari) and the young soldier Konstantin Koverchenko (Jason Patric). This last one realizes that his commander is totally out of control, and he knows that something very wrong can happen. Konstantin is a guy who play by the rule, even keeping notes over his colleagues bad behaviors. After many baseless suspicions of treason Daskal kills the translator making Konstantin very angered. As result the soldier is tied up on a rock as a punishment for being insubordinate to his commander. But luck is on his side and he's rescued by the Mujahadeen. Now even without speaking their language (he only knows a term of friendship that he learned with the translator) he finds new friends (or better saying allies) with one common goal destroy the tank. In short the old saying worked here The enemy of my enemy is my friend. The Mujahadeen group is led by Taj (Steven Bauer, excellent performance, he speaks in a total different language, only using a few words in English) a very brave and faithful leader seeking for revenge and he's become Konstantin's best friend in this reckless war.Released in 1988 this film wasn't a box office hit and it's almost an unknown work from director Kevin Reynolds (Waterworld). Back in the 1980's is one of the rare films about the Afghanistan War (it's a work of fiction) along with Rambo III. But it's a very original film with action scenes and a political criticism (little things), and also a story about how mankind acts in times of war. Two different groups with different cultures can understand each other with only a few words as it was showed here. But what this war was it for? Why did it happened? The titles at the beginning of the film doesn't inform us of why it happened. After watching this movie you might think that everything here was pointless because all you see is the desert, the killings and a tank. No it's more than that. It shows that wars don't have meaningless, stupid, brutal and always kills innocent people (the people of the village in the beginning of the movie). It's also about honor. Konstantin was told by the translator that in Afghanistan people has three words that an enemy can show to them and with these words he will be saved. It's a promise, an honor trade cultivated by the tribes. And that's how he was saved and he learned to trust his old enemies.Desite the cruelty shown at the beginning (the scene involving the tank and the guy crushed by it was very impressive) it's a excellent movie, easy to sit through, very entertaining for audiences who like war films and a thought provoking film for those who enjoy a good criticism about honor, cruel commanders, loyalty and wrath of gods. I really don't know if it works for today audiences (after the plot is dated, there's no more Cold War and Afghanistan is not much on the side that can be cheered after 9/11 but that's another story).

Though now a pacifist, Rambo nevertheless returns for one last job. His old Colonel has been kidnapped by evil Soviets forces and is being imprisoned in a super cool looking military base deep within the heart of Afghanistan. Rambo's mission? Get in, kick ass, get out. As he's essentially a giant walking penis, Rambo severely overcompensates. Not only does he rescue his buddy, but he kicks Russia out of Afghanistan, rallies a band of friendly Mujahideen freedom fighters, teaches locals to love Westerners and schools us all in the evils of communism. The film ends with a title card praising the brave heroes of the Mujahideen.The Living Daylights tells the same tale, though here our hero is British Secret Agent James Bond (Timothy Dalton). Less homo-erotic than Stallone's film, but equally patriotic, Daylights opens with various totems of Britannia - the Rock of Gibraltar, Union Jacks, Harrier jets - before nosediving into a plot about defecting Russians, Afghan opium and evil commies. Once again the film ends with Mujahideen on horseback charging valiantly toward Soviet Forces. The Empires of the West &#x96; and their lovable henchmen, Bond and Rambo - love underdog freedom fighters, see.Less cartoonish but more fascist, The Beast revolves around a Soviet tank crew. They rape and pillage Afghan villages, blow up mosques, their racist, tyrannical leader is shown to hate even pro-communist Afghan allies, and our hero is an enlightened Russian who defects and joins forces with the Mujahideen to once again, like Rambo, charge headlong into Soviet tanks and helicopters.In all these films, the Mujahideen are portrayed as civilised, well educated freedom fighters pitted against remorseless, uncouth Soviet monsters. What's hilarious is that as soon as the Soviet Union collapses, cinema immediately starts portraying the Mujahideen as villains; they're now of no use. They're US public enemy number 1.In 1893 Russia recognised British ownership of Afghanistan. When Britain exited India and its Empire collapsed, Russia moved tentatively in. A communist party was set up and the country's old kings and monarchs kicked out. Major reforms then began taking place - modernisation, a secular government, women's rights, large scale land reforms, public education etc &#x96; which were all initially accepted. Some thought communism wouldn't work in a country as conservative and traditional as Afghanistan, but of course Soviet styled communism turned out to be but a form of industrial feudalism with elements of Russian nationalistic tribalism. Afghans supported these changes. Problems quickly began occurring, though. Afghanistan's filled with diverse tribal groups, and cracks began to appear, both inside the communist party &#x96; different factions vying for control &#x96; and outside, religious and tribal leaders opposing the rapid social changes. As extreme reforms were being carried out in VERY short periods of time with NO concern for Afghan culture, small protests began. Islamist rebels who wanted to restore an older, more traditional Islamic order, were the most vocal. Aided, armed, funded and led by the West, they staged bloody clashes with the pro communist government. This went on for a number of months. Eventually Western backing for these rebels escalated to such an extent that the local government was forced to call for Russian support. Soviet troops arrive, which the West spins as an invasion. Cue Western propaganda here was an evil Soviet invasion being held back by lovable rebels. The truth was almost the complete opposite. Afghanistan was a Soviet ally dealing with CIA-backed Islamist radicals trying to topple the capital of Kabul. Later, US defence secretary Robert Gates would say We mean to suck the Soviets into a Vietnamese-styled quagmire. And Zbigniew Brzezinski We knowingly increased the probability of their intervention with the aim of drawing the Soviets into the Afghan trap. The day that the Soviets officially crossed the border, I wrote to President Carter, 'We now have the opportunity of giving to the Soviet Union its Vietnam War.'For several years the West arms the Mujahideen and uses them to fight a proxy war against the Soviets. Recognising this all as a giant waste of time, the Soviets eventually pull out. The West, meanwhile, continues arming rebels and jihadists. The Mujahideen, essentially religious fanatics, violent gangs and conservative psychos, then begin fighting for control of the country, echoing, of course, the current engineered destabilisation of places like Somalia, Iraq, Syria and Libya. The Taliban/Mujahideen then take over Afgahnistan and rule from roughly 1995 to 2001. When they refuse oil and mineral rights to the US in the late 90s, a campaign begins in the West to turn them into our enemies. From here on the Taliban are blamed for 9/11, linked with al-Qaeda, women's rights abuses and crazy Islamic Laws, none of which were previously deemed a problem until the Taliban began courting Argentinian gas companies over the Unocal-CentGas consortium (ie Bush and Cheney). In response, Unocal appears before the US Congress and demands the removal of the Taliban regime. Days later the Taliban are issued an ultimatum take our offer or we drop the bombs. Months later all US-held Taliban assets are seized, embargoes and bans are put in place and the country is invaded by a Western Alliance. In other words, it was only when absolute control of local resources was challenged that the Taliban regime, played like a puppet for over half a century, was openly discredited.4/10 - Worth no viewings.

SPOILER ALERT- There is one scene where the tank turret makes a 360 degree traverse with ALL weapons firing that is sublime. This movie deserves much more notice than it has been given. The main Mujahadeen characters are portrayed in a bit too much of an angelic light, but the point was, they were the underdogs fighting an invader.

To paraphrase from the dialogue They sure had us on the run, didn't they? To see the human side of a tank crew and the conflicts that all soldiers have among themselves, both with comrades and with conscience, is the achievement of this well-made movie. War is not fun and games, it is serious Hell. The paranoid tank commander (played superbly by George Dzundza) is symbolic of the hard-assed martyr personality that all Empires need to achieve their goals.

The device also allows the Afghanistan setting to seem like Vietnam to the American audience.  This is not really intended to say that the two conflicts are identical, but rather serves as a tool to convey a broader anti-war message.As the film begins, we are in an alien desert setting with the Russian tank crew speaking only in Russian and committing a series of terrible deeds. The camera tightly zooms into the speaking lips of one of the Russians whose native language seamlessly transforms into American English.  The camera then zooms back out to the original framing.  The audience soon begins to empathize with the Americanized Russians and begins to see many parallels between their conflict and our experience in Vietnam.  Americans know very little of the Afghanistan war.  This device, however, makes the war seem less distant.  It helps the audience bond with the characters and better share their later suffering.The film has the authentic and gritty feel of Das Boot with the tank filling in for the submarine.  The detailed and realistic portrayal of the equipment lends greatly authenticity to the drama.

Only Us and Them is more complicated than that, and a thick metal shell turns out to be as much a crazy prison as a secure image of identity, self, Us, in the Middle of Nowhere. ...So I think 'Us' inside the tank speaking (like most of the audience) American English is a brilliant piece of casting or direction.

"},{"Title":"One of the Most Profound and Underrated Movies You Will Ever See","Date":"20 April 2016","Score":"","Genre":"War","Review":" War is hell, as the old saying goes, and as long as has been possible, Hollywood has tried to show what war's really like, sometimes succeeding, other times not so. It's probably fair to say that only a select few war pictures really achieve the grittiness and ugly realism of war, and if you know your films, you probably know which ones (Full Metal Jacket, Apocalypse Now, Platoon , etc.). Yet there is another picture that deserves to be included in this list, a film that although American made, tells a war story that is probably one of the most unlikely ones to be told on the American screen. The film is called The Beast of War. Made in 1988, it tells the seemly simple story of a Soviet tank crew who gets lost in the middle of the unforgiving wilderness of Afghanistan during the Soviet invasion and bloody war that occurred there. Cut off from the rest of their forces, they are mercilessly pursued by a group of Mujahadeen fighters, or Afghan guerrillas, in revenge for a massacre carried out by the crew in their village, all shown in horrific, graphic detail that grabs the viewer in the opening. Leading the pack of the crew is the tyrannical and hard charging officer Daskal (George Dzundza in a terrific performance) a veteran who fought at Stalingrad and who is determined to maintain the honor of the motherland. The soldiers below him, though, are far more likely thinking a question most soldiers in wars through out the ages have probably asked Just what the hell are doing here? That's certainly the question being asked by the young soldier Konstantin (Jason Patric in another great performance), who slowly begins to become a thorn in Daskal's side with all his questioning, especially as Daskal grows more paranoid and unjustly distrustful of the crew's Afghan liaison officer Samad (wonderful character actor Erick Avari). Eventually, Konstantin is tied to a rock and left to the mercy of the savages by the increasingly unstable Daskal but unbeknownst to him, fate has other plans. But the movie doesn't just show the workings of the tank crew, it also intimately shows the Afghans who are following them, showcasing the conflicts of interest and power dynamics within their group, and their hunt for the beast, as they call the tank. Leading them is their newly minted village chief, or Kahn, Taj (played by Steven Bauer of Scarface fame in a most convincing performance) who, like the Russians, is under pressure to uphold the values and expectations of his people. The Beast is probably one of the most unique war films ever made, in that here you have an American made movie that deals with a foreign war that we were not fighting in at the time - though we were giving significant support to various groups within the Afghan Mujahadeen - and one that was being fought by our arc rival at the time, the Russians or Soviets. And yet, somehow, the film transcends these barriers and under the superb direction of Kevin Reynolds, creates characters and a story that somehow seem universal from time to time or conflict to conflict. Even though the soldiers are Russian, the films is able to show them as soldiers that can be found in any army, be it here in the good old, US of A or anywhere else for that matter. Granted, part of this is due to the fact the guys speak American English rather than English with a Russian accent. But it somehow, it all just works. As for the actors playing the Afghans, everyone of them must be congratulated, not only acting wise for their individual characters but also for convincingly speaking the Pashto language, something that must have had its own challenges involved. The Beast truly is one of those rare films that manages to not only show the ugly reality of war and dark side of man but also something universal about humanity, human connections, and culture, all of it enhanced by Mark Isham's majestic and hauntingly beautiful music score. The Afghans fight for what their culture holds dear, as do the Russians. But the funny thing is, if race, ethnicity, or ideology didn't separate them, many of these characters might have made good friends. Sadly, though, The Beast of War is a movie that managed to fall through the cracks, perhaps because of the unique subject matter of the film, which is a shame, for as the United States tries to bend Afghanistan to its will and bring it into the modern age, The Beast is able to fully show the hopeless situation the Soviet Union found itself in, and why we, my fellow Americans, probably won't have much luck there either, when all is said and done. Funny how man fails to learn from the past, isn't it folks? For this and other reasons that I simply cannot put into words at the moment, Beast of War is a film that should be seen at least once in your life, not only because of its story but stellar acting, be it Patric, Don Harvey, or Steven Baldwin of the Baldwin brothers!

Unfortunately for this tank it has entered a valley through a pass which is the only escape route. The anti-Soviet Afghan rebels did not take kindly to the brutal destruction wreaked by this tank, which they referred to as the beast. The desire to avenge the attack is strong enough to unite a couple of feuding rebel tribes, and the story details the single-minded determination of the rebels to pursue and destroy the tank. In the process we get to know the five member crew in the tank as well as some of the rebels. There is a goodly amount of footage from the interior of the tank--claustrophobes beware.The tank commander is of the old school, having fought the Nazis in WWII at the age of eight. His obsession to get back to safety with his tank creates stress within his crew, to say the least. There is enough conflict in this movie to fuel several films--conflict among the tank crew, conflict among the rebels, conflict between the tank crew and the rebels. The pacing kept my attention throughout. The cinematography is outstanding. The desert landscape plays an important role and the camera uses it to great effect. The musical score contributes in establishing mood, but it is not intrusive. All of the actors were up to the task.

The company that distributed it, if not the production company that produced it, went bankrupt, was bought out by I forget whom, then redistributed to theaters under the title The Beast. That's what happened.So, yes the only thing that really takes away from Beast is that we have our Soviet tankers speaking with American accents. Look past that and you have a war movie on par with Hamburger Hill or even Saving Private Ryan. The message that this one sends, I'll venture to say, has a lot more to say than Ryan, but let's not start with the comparisons and contrasts. (Personally, I like Ryan a whole lot, but I also think it is a tad overrated.)With Beast, you have to keep in mind the German invasion of the Soviet Union in the 1940s, specifically the siege of Stalingrad, which saw the Russians taking a victory over the undefeatable German army. This time around, the tables are reversed, and it's the Russians who are the aggressors. (Honestly, I still don't know what pretext was used for Soviet Russia to invade Afghanistan. I should read about that.) Jason Patric plays Konstantin Koverchenko, driver of the tank crew which has taken a wrong turn into a valley that has only one way in and out. Soviet ideology and his proclivity to think for himself, apparently, don't mix well, and so when he and his crew are doggedly pursued by a band of Mujahadeen, he is more and more disillusioned with the Soviet invasion.To make matters worse, his tank commander Daskal (played by George Dzundza from The Deer Hunter) is an ardent Soviet&#x97;but more so war hawk&#x97; and when a dispute over a fellow crew member, an Afghan communist patriot, ends with the murder of that crew member, whom Koverchenko endeavoured to protect from Daskal's irrational suspicion&#x97;when that happens, proverbial sh&#x97;&#x97; hits the proverbial fan. To make a long story short, Koverchenko shifts loyalty to the Mujahadeen, for whom he has sympathy and admiration.One Mujahid in particular&#x97;Taj&#x97;is played by Steven Bauer from Scarface and Traffic fame. I am not an expert on Arabic, but he seemed pretty damn convincing to me as a freedom fighter. We also have in the tank crew Stephen Baldwin in, perhaps, his best role apart from The Usual Suspects. We also have Don Harvey, who has been, and probably will always be, type-casted as the scumbag character. (If you do not know whom I speak of, he is the fellow from Creepshow 2, Casualties of War, Tank Girl, and why don't we include Die Hard 2 for extra measure? The only movie that I can think of right now where he doesn't play a scumbag is perhaps The Untouchables. You could put The Thin Red Line in there if you'd like, but it's such a small part that&#x85; well, I don't know.)In any case, what we have is a bunch of a character actors and one semi- starring actor taking on an ambitious project. The product is gold. Mark Isham's score is something of a highlight itself. Seriously, this movie is such a downer if you really think about it. (Mark Isham, by the way, also scored Crash. So-so movie, badass OST.) Dour, yes, and bittersweet, too. On top of that, The Beast has one of the best endings I've ever seen in my lifetime.

Soviet T- series of tanks, a helo and various weapons aren't cheap, and the location is perfect, but wouldn't it be interesting to cast some Soviet Afghan war vets in these roles? I can't help but wonder if that would add something to the film.As it is now it's a pretty good military thriller. I personally can only watch it once perhaps every couple of years or so, because the violence is pretty graphic and downright sick at times.

A great deal of skill is employed in making weapons, equipment and their use realistic. The battle scenes are made so much more powerful by incorporating the details of actually using weapons; the difficulties of manoeuvring them into position; loading, aiming, repairing. This film leaves you with the feeling of having experienced rather than watched.This film has a strong and original plot with many turns that you won't guess. The acting is realistic in the sense that each character is a component of the environment, fully integrated with it. This is something that big name actors just don't seem to want to do these days. The realism extends to the fundamentals of not taking sides - we see barbarism on both sides, and also see both sides demonstrating both military skill and failings.The production values are first rate with excellent sound (you can hear every word) and cinematography which captures the stunning desert setting vividly (but without empty landscape scenes being used to pad the film out).Its a film that maintains the interest throughout, and leaves a satisfied, worthwhile feeling to having watched it.

It is the only war movie covering that time, 1981, of the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan to shore up their puppet government in Kabul, that I have ever seen or know of. It is refreshing to see a movie from the other side's point of view, in this sense like Cross of Iron.The mythos is like other war movies, such as Enemy Below, in which the commander is not going to give up his ship for any reason. The Soviets here are tankers, and its Stalingrad-surviving commander is NOT going to give up his tank to anyone, even if this war is not as glorious and noble to fight as the Great Patriotic War was. In spite of the gruesome scene near the beginning, there is not that much prolonged violence later on, no more than what you would see in any war movie. The Afghanis themselves seem like real Afghani people, not actors.It is worth seeing this film for the vivid cinematography alone! The camera work is indeed IMAX quality! The Soviet T-62 tank almost looks to pretty to be a battle vehicle, more like a glorified SUV on display. I'm not sure where the film was actually shot, but it looks convincing enough to be Afghanistan.The only real criticism I have of the movie is the Afghani subtitles are displayed a little too quickly for me to read them; however, the storyline is simple enough that one can guess at what they said anyway.

In the times of cold war, this movie didn't focused on anti-soviet propaganda which had become a trend in those times. What i found in this drama is that wars can somehow turn men into beasts regardless whatever group , class and ethnicity they belong. Its up to men how they can verify and differentiate between Good and evil. Here a young lieutenant , a Russian born , koverchanko is part of a squad in a soviet tank in afghanistan. The tank commander daskal is a ruthless over zealot soldier who is totally blind in loyalty and patriotism for his country. Moreover he is too much obsessed with his love of the tanks. When he destroyed a local village with the assistance of other three members of his tank, koverchanko now is caught between his conscience and his loyalty & military duties. Due to his friendly attitude toward an afghan soldier in the tank and always being writing reports about the misuse of power by his superior and fellow officers , koverchanko is labeled as a traitor and abandoned by the tank in manner to die with suffering long days. Being hounded by the wolves and then hit by the stone throwing women he is rescued by Taj. Taj is the local afghan mujahid whose village is destroyed by the daskal calls the tank as THE BEAST. He is also in some differences with some other locals groups who belong to different ethnic backgrounds as we all know. Together now they pursue and chase the beast. Here in this scenario daskal is acting like barnes of platoon and koverchanko is portraying himself as both elias and chris of the same drama. Both of them have got their own perspectives about conducting their duties which leads them to a collision course.While taj and koverhcanko become allies regardless that koverchanko is the enemy and belonged to the same tank crew who had devastated their village. Its only because he traced a better man inside his own rivals. Their culture , life styles and even language doesn't matches but their minds do. By watching such movies it is clear that if a person in a brutal war always keeps himself to his military duties and never wishes to indulge in hateful and prejudice oriented activities he really is a good man. In a war even enemies can show respect to each other if they understand each others point of view. This all about your conscience.

A tank in a modern army, possessed of satellite communication, being chased through the desert and that army seemingly pretending it didn't exist.The acting it must be said, is not bad, and the hero receives some real character development. The point of the movie is also compelling enough - war is evil. The film's insistence on demonizing the Soviets and employing them as a force of pure evil makes this a rather bad source of information on Afghanistan.A well made piece of Cold-War trash in my opinion. Watch it if you like, but get your history somewhere else.

This film is an example in how to live and how to die. Nanawati is the title of the play on which this film is based. Nanawati means Sanctuary in Afghan and is one of their basic codes. One that asks for Nanawati must be given all hospitality, succor and protection regardless! As Koverchenko the Russian tank driver comments when the codes are explained to him by the tanks interpretor How civilized.Another quote that I think sums up of how Russia is depicted during the film. Koverchenko confronts Daskal the tank commender near the end of the film and asks How is it that now WE are the Nazis? Now as American forces occupy Afghanistan one must wonder about the outcome the Tali ban is gone but still there is resistance. The gallant people of Afghanistan fight on against what they perceive as an invading army. US forces are there and as the Soviets, English and Turks discovered the Afghan people have nothing to lose.By the way; How is it that now we.............

It's a robust, masculine adventure, drawing heavily on the juvenile appeal of hardware and firepower, but with more guts than glory at the end of the pursuit and a surprising blend of character development balanced against all the military action. Mark Isham's atmospheric music score sets an effective mood, but it might have been a more challenging film (though of course less accessible) if the Russian troops had thought to camouflage their Southern California accents it's as if they came through the Khyber Pass by way of Malibu Beach. The Afghan natives speak through subtitles, so why not the Soviet invaders as well?

In a nutshell it's a movie about a Russian tank crew against a bunch of Afghan Mujahedeen. Both groups don't exactly get portrayed as pleasant ones. It would had been OK if this had been a sort of realistic anti-war movie, that showed the horrors, pointlessness and madness of war and that showed there is no good and evil in war but the movie very much has a typical Hollywood action type of approach to the whole story. I actually think that Jason Patric was supposed to be the main 'hero' of the movie but he simply doesn't get featured prominently enough for that, especially not during the fist half. This to me made the movie a very distant one to watch. I couldn't care for any of the characters and I don't know what side I was supposed to cheer for.But honestly, it's still a pleasant enough movie to watch. Not as an heavy movie with a serious massage in it but more as a simplistic action flick. The movie does certainly has its moments, though I also still think they could had done far more with its concept, action and story-wise.The characters should had been developed way more and better. That way we might had perhaps cared some more about any of them and would had given the story and movie in general some more depth as well. It's not like they didn't had the right actors for it. The movie has some good actors in it, that are also some well known names in the business.An entertaining enough but ultimately pointless and bland little war movie.6/10http//bobafett1138.blogspot.com/ "}{"Title":"Location and casting mistakes let down an otherwise decent flick","Date":"28 April 2012","Score":"0 out of 4 people found the following review useful","Genre":"War","Review":" ... as do its origins as a play. William Mastrosimone's a good enough playwright but doesn't have a good grasp of screenplays. The potential's there in the idea but he makes his political points too clumsily and there are far too many convenient coincidences that would have been (were?) overlooked on a stage. Even so, the biggest problem is the miscasting of the tank commander. He's never credible, despite his acting abilities, which are considerable. He's just miscast. He's the overweight sidekick or the comic relief, not a driven, battle-hardened Soviet commander. The other mistake was filming it in Israel. While parts of Afghanistan are barren, using Israel as a stand in flattens the film and lessens the impact of the Soviet presence. Hard to explain but it's clear when you see the film that the backdrop is wrong. Not a bad film but it could have been so much better.

Firstly there is the fact that all the Russians have American accents ? Which I found to be quite ridiculous. Then there are the Afghan rebels who are portrayed so ridiculously as if they are backward natives and have no idea how to fight. The Communications between Jason Patric's Character and Steven Bauer's are almost hilariously stupid. This is another dumb American war film made during the Cold War attempting to show the Russians as Barbaric Soldiers, and in the end Jason Patric sides with the Afghans against his crazed tank commander played by George Dzundza. I did not find this to be a great war movie certainly nowhere near Saving Private Ryan, The Thin Red Line, The Big Red One, Attack. It was not a bad film, some of the scenes within the Tank were quite tense but this was just a decent low budget effort and not an all time classic.

Apparently it can go for at least 2 straight days. Typical Hollywood treatment of a ruthlessly committed military war-hawk, very few, if any, of which exist in real life, and the noble private who questions the mission and the method of war.  Moments of comedy exist, I couldn't get enough of the Afghan rebel discussing with the exiled Russian tank driver whether or not the RPG they captured would 'kaboom tank', or the women villagers chasing the tank around the desert, presumably to throw rocks at it.  If you want quality anti-war movies, this is not the one for you.  This one is not quite as gung ho as Rambo III at portraying the noble Afghans against the evil Bear, but it is in the same vein.  Stick with Platoon, Das Boot, or even A Midnight Clear. "},{"Title":"Almost OK. Too many basic flaws.","Date":"4 September 2007","Score":"2 out of 11 people found the following review useful","Genre":"War","Review":" *** Synopsis ***A Russian tank does its job in Afghanistan during the Russian occupation. It roams the land in search of enemies. It turns out the team-leader is a piece of scum who doesn't care much for the Geneva convention.*** Good Stuff ***I feel the camera work was decent. There's much better out there, but also much worse. The scenery is nicely done as well. Also, the sound is absolutely acceptable.*** Bad Stuff ***It has all the elements of a B-movie although some actors aren't really B-movie actors; Basically the acting was mediocre. Most actors have clearly western blood. Clear American accents as well. All in all I didn't have the feeling I was looking at Russian/Afghan soldiers or culture.The movie is also highly predictive. Perhaps I didn't know all the time what will happen in a few minutes, but when it happened I wasn't surprised. Often it is even plain ridiculous. Here's an example Tankdriver says to Tankgunner that Tankgunners need to be careful as snipers often shoot them first. The Tankgunner says that often the driver is targeted first (they had a quarrel about nothing by the way so they are tensed). Three seconds later a hand grenade is thrown at the tank (crew outside). The blasting-power is that of a fire cracker. The crew is surrounded by 5 or so armed Afghani fighters. Everybody survives and manages to get into the tank. An Afghani warrior shoots a bazooka at the tank from a distance of 20 yards. Tank is driving slowly backwards yet the fighter misses. This is what I mean with being predictive and being ridiculous.Here's another one a hand grenade explodes at a distance of 3 inches near two dogs. The dogs run away unharmed...*** What others said ***I don't understand this movie has such a high rating. Perhaps military uniforms and the Afghan war against Russians has it's attraction. The desert has its own charm as far as I am concerned. But the movie is implemented cheaply. The director of the movie is clearly interested in human relations but the conversations are trivial and shallow. If not shallow, then most certainly not convincing.*** Verdict ***I would have loved to give this movie a high rating but I can't. Although it has tons of potential, it wasn't used. I'll give it a 4 out of 10. One point for the scenery, 1 for the sound, 1 for camera work, 1 for potential.

Set in Afghanistan when the Russians had invaded the story is of a tank of invaders who are meant to be Russian and the plot follows them trying to escape a desert valley in their tank from a bunch of Afghans. It took me a while to realize that the people in the tank were meant to be Russian as they are all Americans with broad accents from that nation but dressed in Russian uniforms and with Russian names. There is a world of difference not only in speech but in mannerisms, characteristic's and attitude between Americans and Russians; it is a fatal flaw in the movie to expect the viewer to accept otherwise a bit like, for example, having a cowboy and Indian film with the latter played by Polish people! And the film makers here had Arabs talking in Arabic with English sub-titles but for whatever reason decided wrongly to portray the Russians in this way. The result being that my credibility in the movie was lost completely. There are other major errors. The tank commander is a murderous, sadistic lunatic who given the opportunity to escape by air from his predicament refuses to do so. That is ludicrous. And some of the Arabs are portrayed as having scruples and mercy even when they capture one of the enemy. Note the date of the film, before 9/11 and we all know what the terrorists in Iraq feel about mercy. Now no one likes to be a critic as there are some interesting and realistic desert scenes and the photography is not bad in parts. But this picture is so erroneous in important aspects, I cannot go above the minimum vote 1/10. "}]
