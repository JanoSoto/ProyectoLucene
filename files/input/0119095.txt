[{"Title":"Hope in the unreal","Date":"22 January 1999","Score":"28 out of 31 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama, Family, Fantasy","Review":"  Based on a famous Cottingley fairies hoax perpetrated by two English girls during World War I in 1917, FairyTale A True Story presents alternate views of reality to suggest that, like the view of Aborigines, dreams are as real as conscious reality. If you take the special effects fairies too literally in this film, you will miss the point. The film plays a trick on you, just as the original incident played a trick on Sir Arthur Conan Doyle in 1917. Houdini, as played by Harvey Keitel, gets the point. Although he's one to debunk mystics who defraud the gullible, he too trades on people's need to believe in magic. The girls' deception is also a sort of benign fraud. As any magician, they should never reveal their secret. The film invites comparisons to the famous French classic, Forbidden Games in which children construct an elaborate fantasy world as a way of coping with the reality of war. Here too, the girls use fairies to fill the void in their lives left by their father, who has gone missing on the front in France. I know what they mean by 'missing,' says one of the sisters, conscious of reality but hoping to believe in the unlikely event of his return. This is not a kiddie film, but a langorous period piece on the nature of belief and faith in the face of empirical skepticism. The film reinforces its theme with beautiful details, as at the end when the father says he smells the perfume which isn't there, or in the ghostly intrusion of a dead brother that changes the mind of a skeptical reporter. Even the final sequence, involving fairies, is so charming it steers clear of cynical manipulation. Although there are moments when the plot seems to become arbitrary or plodding, it's all tied up neatly and beautifully in a magical finale. I'd hesitate to call this a classic, but it is a worthwhile sleeper. Just bring an open mind and heart.

No truer words can be evoked to describe the purpose and effect of this beautiful film. Charles Sturridge ('Brideshead Revisited' and 'A Handful of Dust') has assembled a cast that would be the envy of many other top flight producers and directors embarking upon a serious film. That is not to say this isn't a serious film, it is. It is marketed for children, naturally, but it has deeper levels that challenge the adult mind far beyond what one normally encounters in films directed towards adult audiences.The quality of this script attracted such great actors as Peter O'Toole (Sir Arthur Conan Doyle), Harvey Keitel (Harry Houdini), Bill Nighy, Phoebe Nicholls, Paul McGann and a slew of other well-known British actors. You might also take note of Mel Gibson in an uncredited cameo at the very end.Sturridge and his team of writers has come up with something beguilingly profound, flowing quietly beneath the simple story of two little girls who have managed to photograph fairies at the bottom of the garden. This is based on the famous scandal of the early 20th century when a similar event took place, only in the film the photographs are pronounce authentic whereas in the actual event in England the experts proved the photographs to be false. But the film does not pretend to represent the actual events but moves beyond them to a more fundamental issue of out times.There is nothing twee about this movie either and it could have easily become mawkish and sugar-sweet in less committed hands.I am left, after viewing this film, with Shakespeare's words ringing in my head... there is far more in heaven and earth than meets our little philosophy. In this blighted age of science and money-worship it is good to be reminded that we limit ourselves through our cynical prejudices and need to have everything proved scientifically, usually for profit. When the condition of our lives and society has got you all blocked up, watch this little gem and weep for everything that has been lost to us. You will feel better afterward.I will stop this commentary abruptly now by recommending 'Fairy Tale' to one and all. And get out the Kleenex box before you begin.

The incredible photographs were declared non-hoaxes and even incurred the attention of such as Arthur Conan Doyle and Harry Houdini who visited the girls and examined the phenomenon. Peter O'Toole especially, as Conan Doyle is just superb in his characterisation (why am I NOT surprised?)Absolutely sumptuous cinematography, a most literate of scripts and some grade A acting, especially from the two girls. The film had a larger budget than PHOTOGRAPHING FAIRIES and it shows. The highlight of course and that which the younger viewers must wait patiently for, is the quite staggering appearance of the fairies at the end.

On a metaphysical level the film says that if you really believe in something, however odd or outlandish, it will come true or be true. There's no sense in being contentious about the basis of this film because that is very much valid as I have pointed out above. To do so, as I see some people have done over here, is to not only misunderstand the message of the film but to downplay its other  qualities.The acting of Florence Hoath as Elsie and Elizabeth Earl as Frances is really impressive. Both have done complete justice to their characters. The rest of the cast, Paul McGann as Elsie's father, Peter O'Toole as Arthur Conan Doyle and Harvey Keitel as Houdini are also really good. I also absolutely agree with most of the reviewers here that the early 20th century has been evoked very well. But of course, the best thing about the film is the cinematography. It's gorgeous! The woods where the girls encounter the fairies are evoked beautifully, they're appropriately dreamy and realistic. Praise must definitely be due to the set decorators who have done a brilliant job with the house that the Wrights live in and especially the room which Elsie and Frances share. It's a dream garret room! The music is also quite good. I thoroughly recommend this film, certainly for those who believe in Believing things and also for those who like to watch a really well made period film.

The story is true about the photos and how they tricked people. But the fairies flying around and bathing with fins and dodging cigarettes while carrying suitcases is not true. The ghost of a child blocking a doubting reporter from framing these girls after breaking into their room is also not true. This movie should not have A True Story at the end. It would be like Titanic A True Story, simply because the ship sinking is true. This is a good movie at times, has a lot of charm and the magic shines through. Harvey Keitel seems more like a downtown New York thug than a famous magician. The two leads who play the girls are charming, sweet, and talented. But my problem goes back to the truth; if they are going to show fairies they should have only showed them when the girls were present, so then it would be assumed that they might be only in the girl's imagination... or not. Showing the fairies flying around without the girls turns this true story into a fairy tale, as in... it ruins the entire mystique that the pictures raised in the first place. The movie should center more on the hoax, on how the girls did what they did to trick scholars, famous writers and basically an entire continent. That would be interesting. Instead we get a fairy tale within a fairy tale with a false premise of the entire thing being true, that is, a movie that is telling us that fairies actually exist by tagging this a true story. It's not true, it's merely based on truth. Just like The Titanic, which didn't have A True Story added to the title; this movie should only be called FairyTale, or better yet, The Cottingley Hoax, or something based on actual history, not manipulation.

Houdini maintains, of course, that they have done so, however unlikely it may seem.It strikes me that what Houdini says is correct and that THIS IS A BETTER STORY TO TELL!  It is precisely because it seems so unlikely that makes it such a good story (now that we know the truth).My view is that the two little girls were hoaxers, but that doesn't mean I don't have an enormous amount of respect for their achievement.

Apparently, it looks like the adults will be far more interested than the children because of its long discussions about fairy sightings and its overly dramatic nature; this actually is the kind of audience this movie was shooting for. On the children's side, it is magical in the make-believe universe, but not without a couple of horrifying and sorrowful moments (the scarred-face soldier out of WWI, for instance), and may end up as boredom along the way. The fairies and their surroundings would have looked better on the screen if they appeared larger, but there some things to believe in, just as the opening scene tells you; they do exist as fantasy figures to enlighten a child's imagination. The two young girls pull off some charming performances, and some luscious scenery is vivid all throughout. FAIRYTALE should have been a real family fantasy picture in the way it is presented, but stands out its own way as a movie that focuses on a slight examination of sightings that is virtually unexplainable (almost similar to science fiction!). Children will most likely appreciate the fairies more than the movie itself. And where is Mel Gibson???

Despite the wonderful and believable acting of Florence Hoath and Elizabeth Earl, the incoherent screenplay and direction ruin everything and only a shadow of the childhood magic remains in the dark corner pushed away by the social-drama clichés (they even managed to insert there a villain and the goddammit comic relief!). And the top-notch CGI doesn't help out. There's more magic even in ghost-story movies, such as 'Lady in White' or 'The Changeling'. Worth watching, but only once. I deeply hope that some day someone will make a movie worthy of this story's spiritual background, so you'd understand why some perfectly sane people believe in fairies, even without the photographs.One of my favorite books is the collection of narrative tales, recorded in the middle of the 20th century among the Siberian villagers, mostly in the Chita region, by V.P. Zinovyev, and the thing I really love and adore in those stories is that those people actually believe all the folklore things they're speaking about! It's grievous that there are less and less such people live in this world, of that kind who believe because of the purity of the heart, not because of fear or passion.

Soon, the scientific community was deriding the photographs as a joke, but others, including Sherlock Holmes creator Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, remained convinced of their veracity.FAIRY TALE A TRUE STORY is anything but a true story, taking as it does huge liberties with the original story. These range from the minor and rather enjoyable - Harry Houdini plays a significant role here, not that he did in real life, although I appreciated Harvey Keitel's performance nonetheless - to the extreme, i.e. the sight of CGI fairies floating around. I appreciate that the latter scenes were included to pander to the kids, but I think the film would have done a lot better by leaving it up to the viewer to make his or her own mind up rather than being so blatant about it.Otherwise, attention to period detail is good, and the child performers give strong turns.

The photos get into the hands of the Theosophical Society and then the press and cause a great to-do. Sir Arthur Conan-Doyle (O'Toole) and Houdini (Keitel) are swept up in the investigation.First things first. The two little girls are as cute as all get out. The older one is thoughtful and reserved. The younger one is expressive and whimsical. (The first will grow up loving wisely; the second will love too well.) The younger girl has even features and may grow up to be quite beautiful and well known if she decides to pursue an acting career. I can't remember the names of the actresses but both are splendid in their roles. How do you get kids that young to act so well on screen? At the same time, we have to be careful about believing the tales that kids bring us. Joan of Arc was only a teen ager, and St. Bernadette was fourteen when she had her visions. And let's not forget that the witch hunts of Salem, Massachusetts, were begun because of the fairy tales spun by a handful of girls the same age as the ones in this movie. So watch out.Okay. The second thing that impressed me is the location. Rarely has West (or North) Yorkshire looked so ravishing. It's summer and the hills are like slight sea swells, criss-crossed by stone walls. And the place where the girls claim to have found the fairies! It's tranquil, placid, languorous, bewitching. There's a trickling rill that spreads out and runs a few inches deep across flat gray rocks, in some spots forming miniature pools. Overhead are drooping branches. And it's all surrounded by light forests and fields of pale purple flowers. I'm telling you, if you lie too long next to that brook, especially in the light of a full moon, you too will be overcome by your collective unconscious and the sprites and elves will come fluttering forth.Of course the two little girls are frauds, but consider the times. For Europe, unlike America, the first war was a horrendous bloody catastrophe that accomplished nothing in the long run and had little cause in the first place. And in the previous generation, science seemed to have made great advances and offered up a challenge to belief in the supernatural -- meaning no afterlife, no heaven or hell, no nothing. Damned Darwin and Freud and their acolytes and bulldogs. Conan-Doyle had just lost a son pointlessly. It's no wonder the two little liars became sensations. Like the magic of the fairy home, mysticism was in the air. For a similar story from the same period, see Miss Morrison's Ghosts. It's a slow movie, especially if you've recently been fed a diet of slam-bang action movies. It's done in a classical (old-fashioned) style with a mostly still camera. Yet there are moments of tension and drama. And the acting is superb. Peter O'Toole is a very gentlemanly and sad Conan-Doyle. And Keitel -- who looks great in his stage make up as Houdini -- is the friendliest of skeptics. Supporting parts are well done and, as I say, it would be hard to improve upon the two girls. The only sour note is the villainous reporter (McInernny), a gawky and ambitious character with a long neck and tiny jaw who undergoes his own comic conversion.It all ends, appropriately, with dozens of fairies buzzing around like dragonflies, although they're all fakes.

It has wonderful cinematography, an interesting story line, and a competent cast which evokes the period in question (WWI England). I probably wouldn't have watched it having seen the title, but while surfing the satellite channels, I came upon a scene with Peter O'Toole and Harvey Keitel, and I was transfixed.It's true that the story was inspired by a true story. I deliberately say inspired rather than based since the filmmakers did not base much of anything on reality. It's true that two girls (16 and 10, not the younger ages depicted in the movie) revealed photographs they had taken of fairies in the woods, and it's also true that Arthur Conan Doyle ate it up like Orson Welles at a smorgasbord. That's where the true part of the movie begins and ends. Really, the filmmakers should be ashamed of themselves for adding A True Story to the title. They graphically and unequivocally showcase the fairies/gnomes/little people flying, scrambling, and cavorting in the woods -- if this is true, why not come out with their own set of Cottingley photos? The movie is very entertaining, it's a well-done fantasy and has a magical air to it, but please! Please don't call it a true story! It's an insult to the movie audience.Leaving out that the girls themselves, in later years, admitted the photos were faked, and leaving out that the poses of the fairies are identical to those in an illustration in a book of poems and stories that the girls no doubt possessed, one can tell instantly that the photos are fakes, and in my mind, not even clever ones. Conan Doyle was so gullible that he is on record disbelieving American psychics the Fox sisters when they themselves admitted their antics were all a hoax! He maintained that the spirits were acting through the sisters, even if they didn't believe so and were deliberately faking their seances! So let's not attach too much importance to Doyle believing in these fairy pictures. And Houdini is thrown in there for no good reason, simply because the writers discovered that he and Doyle were friends.Still, as I say, it's an engaging movie, well acted and filmed. I would have much preferred the director had left out the fairy scenes. Without those, they could have kept the true story aspect in all honesty, leaving the audience to decide whether the girls were charlatans or not. Leaving A True Story in the title is not only dishonest and misleading, it detracts from what otherwise is a very compelling and entertaining tale of two little girls and a wartime public, some of whom were desperate enough to believe in fairies!

The premise for this film was the charming story of two young English girls who have found genuine evidence of the existence of fairies.  But rather than leave whether or not the fairies existed to the imagination of film audiences the filmmakers instead gave away all the cards by showing bad special effects of the fairies.  Didn't these filmmakers see Jaws?  That film worked because you didn't see the shark right away.  It built up a sense of wonder and dread about the killer unseen shark.  The first Alien was also super scary since you only saw glimpses of the alien until the end.  These are very different movies than Fairy Tale but the jist of the argument remains the same.  In short, films can be MUCH MORE POWERFUL WHEN YOU LEAVE CERTAIN ELEMENTS TO THE VIEWERS IMAGINATION!  E.T. also had the same sense of wonder about the main other worldly character because you didn't see it right away either.I heard someone did an unauthorized edit of The Phantom Menace and cut out all of Jar Jar Binks ultra irritating scenes.  Good show.  Maybe someday they will do the same with this film and leave ALL the fairy footage on the cutting room floor where it belongs.  Maybe we'll get lucky and they'll be an improved director's cut on DVD of the film and the filmmakers will do just that!  But I doubt it.  This film's story had some great supporting real life people in it.  Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, Houdini.  With a cast like that how could they miss?  But sadly, they did.  It's not all bad, but it only gets a mediocre rating from yours truly.  The Mel Gibson cameo was cool though.

It brings elements of fantasy and enters it into present day. Two girls get snap shots of fairies in the wilderness, which gives them unwanted media attention. Good concept with little information about the fairies. They do not appear until the end of the film, which may ruin it for its intended audience. Directed by Charles Sturridge who previously made Aria. He is backed with beautiful photography and visual elements. Florence Hoath and Elizabeth Earl make a fine pairing as two carefree girls who happen upon the extraordinary and are suddenly thrust into media spotlight. Unfortunately Harvey Keitel as Harry Houdini serves little purpose. One could say that the character references the magic or fantasy elements but in his own film the Houdini character would flourish. Here he is a bad distraction. Peter O'Toole also makes an appearance but he never makes an impact. The special effects are the sell and that element works well, particularly when the fairies finally make an appearance in all their glory. Theme of media manipulation allows the film a documentary appeal but since the film has more adult appeal than for children it leaves the biggest tale told by the filmmakers.

Perhaps it would not have had such a general appeal, and would have been less commercial. The notion that it was all a hoax, and yet true at the same time, seemed disingenuous. The story of how grief and loss in the years after the First World War led many to become self-deluded and consequently vulnerable to psychic charlatans is a very adult one. Houdini was a hero in the cause of stamping this shoddy business out. He was a champion of reason. I have no problems with films that alter and compress historical events for dramatic reasons, but this film actually negated the essence of the true story and wasted an opportunity. And we were deprived of the delicious final twist, when the surviving girl (by then an old lady) confessed all in the 1980s. The film was an enjoyable fantasy, and could have been presented as being inspired by, but not based on actual events (as were Citizen Kane and Personal Services). There is always going to be a problem with films based on true events, and in this case it seemed like a good story trashed. "},{"Title":"FairyTale A True Story","Date":"2 February 2012","Score":"","Genre":"Drama, Family, Fantasy","Review":" As the title says, this film is apparently, loosely anyway, based on the real life story of Cottingley Fairies, this story of course turned out to be fake, but this film at least creates the sense of realism felt at the time by many people, from director Charles Sturridge (Lassie). Basically, set in the early 20th Century, England, during the time that electricity and photography had been invented, many people have their own particular beliefs and become fascinated with phenomenas, including writer and Sherlock Holmes creator Sir Arthur Conan Doyle (Peter O'Toole) and magician, escapologist and stunt performer Harry Houdini (Harvey Keitel). The daughter of devoted father Arthur (Paul McGann) and mother Polly (Phoebe Nicholls) who is grieving for the death of the son, twelve year old Elsie Wright (Florence Hoath), has kept her dead brother Joseph's scrapbooks and stuff that relate to fairies. She is joined by her cousin Frances Griffiths (Elizabeth Earl) who has come from abroad while her father goes into action during World War I, and the two of them become close friends, spending much of their time at the brook and near the stream. It is there that they supposedly occasionally see actual fairies, and borrowing Elsie's father's camera they capture two photographs of them together with these fairies, and these are meant as gifts for Polly. However she takes them to Theosophist lecturer Edward L. Gardner (Bill Nighy), who gets them analysed by a photography professional who can determine whether they are fake or not, and they are pronounced genuine, due to fairy wings moving. Many adults say that the girls could have faked the photographs, but more say that they may be real, including Conan-Doyle, and Houdini sees them too, and two more photographs taken allow publication in The Strand, creating a big buzz. The attention however comes from some unwanted sources, with hundreds of people crowding the village looking for fairies themselves, or the girls interacting with them, such as reporters, like John Ferret (Tim McInnerny). The girls have become celebrities when they travel to London, and they get to meet Houdini again, and see his water tank escape performance, and the film ends with him telling Elsie not to reveal anything, only to leave people to make their own minds up, there is a brief return from the fairies, and Frances' Father (Mel Gibson in a cameo) returns from war. Also starring Jurassic Park's Bob Peck as Harry Briggs, War Horse's Peter Mullan as Sergeant Farmer and Four Weddings and a Funeral's Anna Chancellor as Peter Pan. The acting is as good as you are going to get from terrific actors like Keitel, O'Toole and Nighy, and it is a pleasant story, obviously if you knew that the five captured photographs from the real girls were faked it would technically ruin your belief, but either way it is a nice tale that works with the fantasy element, and obviously the small special effects to create the fairies supposedly captured, of course in real life they were gift book cutouts LOL, a worthwhile period drama based on a true story. It won the BAFTA Children's Award for Best Children's Film. Good! "},{"Title":"Enchanting!","Date":"19 August 2010","Score":"","Genre":"Drama, Family, Fantasy","Review":" I LOVE this movie.

And pay attention to the things Houdini says like Never try to fool children. They expect nothing and therefore see everything, because his character exists to articulate the film's themes. These revolve around the need for many people to believe in the existence of spiritual concepts, the wisdom of not challenging these beliefs if they give sustenance, and how loss of the ability to see much that is hidden goes along with our loss of innocence. The innocence is stressed early in the film when an 8 year-old girl fearlessly seeks out a horribly scarred veteran on the train and gets her corporal's help to play a game of cat's cradle. In its best montage the film moves between, Houdini's fabled The Chinese Water Torture Cell illusion, a chess match, and the first-hand spiritual education of an investigative reporter. The film loosely documents the Cottingley fairies incident in 1917 when two English girls produced photographs that showed themselves in the presence of fairies. Sir Arthur Conan Doyle (insert Sherlock Holmes here) published the photographs when he and various experts became convinced they were authentic. Many years later the girls would confess that they had faked all but one of the photos, but they continued to claim that their fairies actually exist. 12-year-old Elsie Wright (Florence Hoath) and 8-year-old Frances Griffiths (Elizabeth Earl) are the girls. It is late in WW1 and Francis has come to live with her Aunt and Uncle because her father is missing in action on the front lines. The Wright's too are dealing with a recent loss as Elsie's brother has passed away. So both children and Mrs. Wright (Phoebe Nicholls) are primed for belief in the other world. Yes there are fairies, the viewer sees them when no people are around and we see them leaving the area when Doyle's revelations cause the property to be trampled by a hoard of both believers and skeptics. The production design and the special effects are impressive and the film is absorbing from scene to scene. The target audience is a little hard to pin down as the subject is geared to children but much of the story a bit confusing if you are not already familiar with historical figures like Houdini and Doyle. The film utilizes the tried and true device for connecting with children by giving them a story about young people who know stuff is real, even though adults don't get it. In the film the age gap between the two girls is slightly less than it was in real life, which gives their relationship a bit more believability. Even more impressive is how successful the director was in the subtle creation two very distinct personalities. Elsie is shy and artistic. Frances is confident and social. Their interplay is the film's real strength; apparently the director sensed this dynamic and worked very hard in his acting for the camera direction of the two young actresses. He kept them in character and added behavioral elements they give their characters considerable depth and dimensionality. Then again, what do I know? I'm only a child.

Fairy Tale has seriously captured what was and is most English! And in so doing has captured and rekindled my awareness and belief in the spirits of nature. The Film shows very cleverly and subtly the truth and the imagination brought together. The whole essence of the film is in its full title! Other reviews and critics seem to have missed this completely. The ingenious story board has not diminished the facts or the truth but enabled the imagination to be truth. The photography is of perfect imagery in each frame and to then attack the visionary senses with the Fairies of such realism has created a magical film that is available to all who have a wealth of imagination, knowing that all reality is ultimately created from it. Thus we also have a film for all. It was so nice to be enchanted for one and a half hours with no violence, no swearing, and no one dying! It has surprised me then that the film got more than a Universal certificate, when films of higher action value have not had such a restriction! However, the truth of the matter is that it is available to everyone on all levels of belief. The story reaches out to the senses and enables you to believe. How each individual believes is up to them but there are few detours from the basic life story of the children to enable the True Story part of the title to be fully accepted. The cleverness comes in how the down to earth side of the story is in harmony with the imagery part. The production team have done their home work well and have come up with a master work that should not be overlooked by bigger production story producers and skeptics, because the importance of the underlying messages, the subtle story within, is the jewel of all story telling and that means film making. This film is believable because of its hidden and obvious truths. The makers of this film and the film its self has a true fan and I would like to thank everyone involved for their wonderful gift. (On a similar subject is the film Photographing Fairies but with a very adult nature. It has a similar story line but from an adults view point. There are similar characters also but fails to be as capturing and enchanting as Fairy Tale. Its worth a good watch though and there is much intrigue. However I would have preferred the story to have been set in modern times rather than copying Fairy Tale in every detail.) Russ Gray.

What this movie has done is made the fairies real so as to create a child's movie.The plot is very thin but it is about people believing in fairies. The end comes with everybody seeing the evidence of the existence of fairies and believing in them. The thing is that the fairies play very little part in this movie and it is more focused on the children. The fairies never speak and interact with the children very rarely.This also seems to be an excuse to parade famous identities in the movie. We have Sir Arthur Conan Doyle and Harry Houdini as major characters in the movie and even show Houdini performing some of his escapes. Doyle is said to have written a book on fairies which my friend wanted to look for. He also said that the soundtrack was relaxing. They liked it but I slept and really had little interest in this movie. These fairies were the beautiful children fairies which I do not like, when it comes to fairies I like Faeries. What is the difference? Faeries are the more adult versions and appear in Mid-summer Night's Dream and Faerie Tale.

One of the most enchanting of this genre is Charles Sturridge's delightful adventure fantasy Fairy Tale A True Story.Fairy Tale/ is a film about nature spirits known as devas, elementals, or fairies and is based on actual events that took place in Yorkshire, England in 1917 in which two young girls claimed to have seen and photographed fairies in the woods near their home in Cottingley Beck. The ensuing debate about the authenticity of the photos sparked a national controversy that pit spiritualists against skeptics and involved such people as Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, author of the Sherlock Holmes mysteries, and famed magician Harry Houdini.The story begins when Frances Griffiths (Elizabeth Earl) comes to England from South Africa to live with her uncle Arthur Wright (Paul McGann), her aunt Polly (Phobe Nicholls), and their daughter Elsie (Florence Hoath). Frances' father is missing in action in the war and Elsie has just lost her eleven-year old brother Joseph from pneumonia. Apparently, Elsie and her brother shared a belief in fairies and Joseph's room is filled with drawings of the barely five inch high winged creatures and an unfinished house for the little people. Frances and Elsie borrow Uncle Arthur's camera and take a photograph of the fairies they see in the woods and the photograph eventually ends up in the hands of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle (Peter O'Toole) who persuades the girls to take four more shots.Sir Arthur, a Spiritualist, believes the photos are real as does Polly, a member of the Theosophist Society, and enlists photographic expert Harold Snelling to test them. Snelling concludes that the dancing figures are not made of paper or any fabric, are not painted on a photographic background, and that all the figures appear to be blurred as if the exposure had caught them moving in their dance. Doyle even involves the famous magician Harry Houdini (Harvey Keitel) who is basically a disbeliever in things supernatural. Both men visit the girls and publish the photos in a magazine called The Strand which brings hundreds of curiosity seekers and journalists to the area in which the fairies were seen. A journalist is convinced that the photographs are faked and sneaks into Joseph's bedroom to try and prove it but is met by a curious visitor.Whether you believe in fairies or not, Fairy Tale A True Story rekindles a sense of wonder at the infinite mystery of life and the joy evident on the faces of the girls in the film's luminous ending seeps quietly into our hearts. Unfortunately, the film fails to inform us that the girls, interviewed in 1982 for an article in The Unexplained, confessed that the photos were hoaxes, cardboard cutouts pinned to the ground with a hatpin. Francis maintained, however, that one of the five pictures was real and stated in her last interview in 1986 that both she and Elsie saw the fairies and believed very strongly in them.She said that, The first time I ever saw anything was when a willow leaf started shaking violently, even though there was no wind, I saw a small man standing on a branch, with the stem of the leaf in his hand, which he seemed to be shaking at something. He was dressed all in green. Whatever the truth may be, there is even to this day still a strong belief in fairies around the Cottingley area and, after seeing Fairy Tale A True Story, some of us may believe in the possibility as well.

I read the comment that said this is a hot renter, and that's good to hear, because this is quite a good film which adults can also appreciate.  Instead of just being a cynical marketing ploy, this is a serious (although there is some humor) and thoughtful film about growing up and magic of all kinds.  As the two young girls, Florence Hoath and Elizabeth Earl are quite good, and Peter O'Toole and Harvey Keitel lend nice support as, respectively, Sir Arthur Conan Doyle and Harry Houdini.  Even if you don't believe in fairies, you'll believe in the magic of this film.

Yet behold!  A studio can advertise its product falsely in the most flagrant way and escape not only legal sanction, but public rebuke as well.  It's pitiful.Here's the truth, if anyone cares.  Fairies do not exist.  Fairies have never existed.  A fortiori, neither these girls nor anyone else has ever seen a fairy or photographed one.  If THAT central plank of the story is rotten, it hardly seems worth while pointing out other inaccuracies ... but I will anyway.  The `girls' were scarcely girls.  They were teenagers.  (One of them, incidentally, had worked in a photographer's shop.)  Harry Houdini had nothing to do with the incident.As for Conan Doyle, he was probably the most gullible person of the twentieth century, at least among those who deserve to be remembered for some other reason.  Towards the end of his life he notoriously believed any old rubbish.  A couple of girls photograph some cardboard cut-outs of fairies in a more or less competent fashion and Conan Doyle trumpets the girl's `discovery' in the press, writes a whole BOOK about the habits of England's wee folk, generally made a fool of himself, and blights the lives of two teenagers who did no more than pull what would otherwise have been a completely harmless prank.  As it was they were never given a chance to live it down.(But to correct a misconception left by another reviewer Arthur Conan Doyle was NOT responsible for Piltdown Man.  The villain behind THAT forgery was Charles Dawson.  There's no particularly good reason to suppose that Dawson even had an accomplice, and no reason at all to suppose the accomplice was Conan Doyle.  Besides, he was too honest to do anything of the kind.  Here's the irony Conan Doyle was actually the VICTIM of one of Dawson's more minor frauds.)I don't demand unfailing accuracy in a film.  `Shadowlands' (for instance) can without deception call itself a true story, because the STORY is true even if every single detail isn't.  (Joy Gresham had two sons rather than one ... well, picky, picky.)  But in `FairyTale' the departures from fact are wild enough to ensure that the resulting story is not, in any reasonable sense, true.  The character names refer to real people that's the most that can be said.In the interests of honesty (o antiquated value) I should say that I haven't seen the film.  Aesthetically speaking it might be very good.  It might even be that the film itself doesn't pretend to be telling the truth, and that if the title were amended - perhaps if a small disclaimer were stuck in the credits somewhere as well - everything would be above board.  Let's hope so.

You see the trailers, you've seen everything. I remember seeing this movie awhile back, and it's memory is very vague in my mind, and that makes much sense. This was such an unmemorable film for me I can remember hardly anything. It was so boring!! What more is there to say? Even kids will snooze with this. The fairies didn't even appear until the end, and they were just THERE. They just popped out of nowhere. The story is so stupid. I mean, is there some kind of moral to the story? Fairies don't exist. And that goes the same for my entertainment for this film. It was all talk, talk, talk with nothing going on. Back in those times, I was just a little kid that was tolerant of anything, but even this bored me so much! A 2/10. And by the way, while I'm talking about movies I don't like, I would like to apologize to The Secret Of Nimh because Invasion Of The Neptune Man was even worse than that movie. But it was the funniest episode of MST3K ever!! Just thought I'd say that. "},{"Title":"Do You Believe In Fairies ?","Date":"8 December 2006","Score":"0 out of 3 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama, Family, Fantasy","Review":" Fairy Tale A True STory (1997) Starring Phoebe Nicholls, Florence Hoath, Harvey Keitel, Peter O'Toole, Jason Salkey, Lara Morgan, Adam Franks, Guy Witcher, John Bradley, Joseph May, Anna Chancellor, Elizabeth Earl, Paul McGann, Bob Peck, Anton Lesser, Lyn Farleigh, Sarah Marsden, Tara Marie, Alannah McGahan, Bill Nighy, Jim Wiggins, Anthony Calf, John Grillo, Benjamin Whitrow, David Norman, Matilda Sturridge, Charlotte Champness, Stuart Howson, James Danaher, Isabel Rocamora Suzy Barton, Ali Bastion, Sean Buckley, Lindsey Butcher, Norma Cohen, Matt Costain, Sophie Griffiths, Tara Kemp, Caleb Lloyd, Marianne Melhus, Genevieve Monastesse, Mark Tate.. Director Charles Sturridge, Screenplay Albert Ash, Tom McLoughlin, Ernie Contreras.This British film from director Charles Sturridge, released in 1997, coincided with the release of the similar independent film Photographing Fairies. This is the true story of the 1917-1918 headline-making incident in which two British girls (played by Phoebe Nichols and Florence Hoath) claimed they saw fairies in the grounds of their father's country home and went as far as photographing the fairies. The photographs of the fairies are world-famous. The girls and their experience with the fairies captivated the imagination and the interest of almost everyone, including the legendary escape artist/magician Harry Houdini (portrayed in the film by Harvey Keitel) and the novelist Sir Arthur Conan Doyle (Peter O'Toole). The girls' father is reported missing in action in Europe during World War I and their apparent grief seems to be, in one level, the explanation for their spiritual encounter with fairies. The non-believers accused the girls and the adults who cared for them of producing the photos themselves through camera tricks as part of an elaborate hoax. The world of spirit and the world of humans interact in this warm, touching film whose theme is that of faith and the nature of faith. But far from focusing on the is it real or not (does Santa Claus exist, do angels exist ?) question, it seems to be more about a world that desperately needs magic, healing and hope. True to history, this time period (the world during WWI) was full of conflict and it was dark. Nations were at war. Old superstitions and beliefs took a backseat to the emerging science and progressive technology- cars, telephones, fast trains, ships, etc). The fairies came at the right time. This was also a time of spirituality and magic. Not only did people's interest in fairies, angels, ghosts and the paranormal/occult begin to arise, but people claimed to communicate with such spiritual entities. While the film leans toward the idea that fairies do exist . Through computer enhanced imagery, we see the fairies soaring about and playing in the countryside and the Fairy Queen Mab (Isabel Rocamora) intervenes to help bring back the girl's father. Surprise, surprise, he is played in a brief one final scene cameo by none other than Mel Gibson. This is a gorgeous, moving film with a lot of heart, intelligence, charm and spirit. The music is lovely, a sort of neoromantic creation that pays tribute to Felix Mendelssohn who wrote incidental music to A Midsummer Night's Dream which features fairies. The exquisite cinematography is by Michael Coulter who gives us great shots of the English countryside, a great contrast to the bleak, dismal hospital scenes in London. Also, we are treated to the theatrical/entertainment scene of this time, which was mostly theater. Sarah Bernhart was performing her last plays and plays like James Berry's Peter Pan as seen in the film were indeed part of theater repertoire. Not to mention Harry Houdini who was astounding the world with his death-defying feats of escape and illusion. This is a wonderful film that you are sure to enjoy. Nevertheless, despite the title, it is actually more of an adult's film because children may have trouble following the well-crafted dialog and plot and would not be familiar with the historical references.
