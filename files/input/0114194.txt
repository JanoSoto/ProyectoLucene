[{"Title":"What a cast!  A shockingly good film.","Date":"28 June 1999","Score":"88 out of 108 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Fantasy, Horror","Review":" Religion has always been a clouded issue to me. There is absolutely no evidence that there is a God or an afterlife. But that hasn't stopped me ( and billions of people ) from believing in something. And I have always been taught that if there is good, then there is also the bad. If there is a heaven, there has to be a hell. The Prophecy tells us that there is, but it is not necessarily that cut and dried. The ruler of hell in this film is more like a character in a Martin Scorsese film. He is evil ( he has to be, he is Lucifer ) but he is not necessarily here to make God's life miserable. He is not necessarily good, but he is in a self serving kind of way.The Prophecy is a very confusing and convoluted but brilliant film. The story ( bear with me here, it's been a while since I've seen this film ) is about a war between angels. Some angels became jealous when God decided he loved humans more than them. They become bitter and decide to start a war in heaven with the angels that are loyal to God. Their theory is that if the angels that oppose them are gone, they can take over certain things and hopefully get God's love back. To do this, they must steal the soul of the most heinous person that ever lived. We meet Gabriel, the lead angel in this crusade, and played by Christopher Walken, he is one of the most entertaining characters I have ever seen in the history of film. He has a sense of humour, he is vicious and he uses humans as slaves to do his dirty work. He catches them just before they are about to die and uses them with the promise that he will kill them once their job is finished. Here we meet Jerry, as his human monkey,and the only reason I mention this is because it is one of Adam Goldberg's early roles. He was Upham in Saving Private Ryan and watching this you could tell he had talent and that he would go places. He is fantastic in this film.Elias Koteas plays Thomas, the only one who may have an insight into what is going on. He was a former priest who understands how religion is playing a part in all of this.Eric Stoltz plays Simon, one of the good angels that is trying to save the world from Gabriel and he is very affective here as well.But the star of this film is absolutely Walken. He is perfect as Gabriel. He has a sense of humour and he is evil at the same time. And in some ways you are rooting for him to win. That is until the very end when Satan shows up, because he steals every scene he is in as well.Satan is played with wicked slickness by Viggo Mortensen. When he speaks he almost slithers and creeps his words onto the screen. He makes a dark scene darker and he keeps you glued to the screen. And his role in this film is one that epitomizes convolution. He is awesome.This film is one that should not be missed. If you don't understand everything about it the first time, watch it again and again. You'll learn something new every time. And you'll enjoy it more and more. This is one hell of a film!!

The theological side of the story is much more interesting than angels being fluffy creatures most people believe in, and are closer to the angels described in older scripts and texts.  You can enjoy this film without being pulled in by beliefs and religion so don't be frightened of it, enjoy the film and another sterling performance by Walken.

And as with the television version, I was entertained.The Prophecy is about the Archangel Gabriel (Christopher Walken) who, believing that his Heavenly Master favors humans more than angels, decides to start a war in Heaven. He goes in search of an evil soul to carry out his dirty work, and Gabriel sets his sights on the spirit of Colonel Hawthorne, a Korean War vet. Gabriel, accompanied by his human lackey Jerry (Adam Goldberg), heads out to the Arizona desert where he digs up Hawthorne's remains, only to find that his soul has been stolen by Simon (Eric Stolz), another angel determined to stop the coming war. Gabriel soon discovers that Simon has hidden Hawthorne's soul inside a little girl named Mary (Moriah Snyder). Soon, it's up to police detective Thomas Daggett (Elias Koteas) and schoolteacher Catherine (Virginia Madsen) to stop Gabriel from obtaining Hawthorne's soul, and things get a bit complicated when Lucifer (Viggo Mortensen) gets into the mix.I really enjoyed this film, mainly because of Walken and his enjoyably off-kilter portrayal as a dark, evil version of the Archangel Gabriel, who, in the Holy Bible, was one of the good guys. (I wonder what the real Gabriel thinks!) In many ways, his performance is brilliant, yet at times, dare I say, laughter-provoking even though it doesn't mean to. All of the other performances by Elias Koteas, Virginia Madsen, Adam Goldberg, and Eric Stolz are just plain fine (but not at all bad), but Viggo Mortensen gives one of the most accurate on-screen portrayals of the Prince of Darkness aside from Al Pacino in The Devil's Advocate. All in all, The Prophecy is an entertaining and sometimes humorous apocalyptic thriller with an inventive (though what some very conservative Christians would probably call unholy) concept about angels and God.I give this film a 10 out of 10 on a scale of 1-10 in my humble opinion.

Christopher Walken is just the correct amount over the top to make Gabriel larger-than-life, as he must be, and not just a human villain. Eric Stoltz is tragic as his counterpart Simon, who has remained loyal to his god through the two wars in heaven, and now has only his duty to sustain him. Elias Koteas brings real feeling to a role that could have been cookie-cutter--the once-almost-priest who now must save the world from evil. And Viggo Mortensen, in his brief on-screen time as Lucifer, is absolutely electrifying in showing that the dark angel is indeed the most beautiful of all.

Standing in his way is the good angel Simon, who hides the soul in a child, a couple of honest citizens, and Lucifer himself, who has his own vested interest in proceedings.Largely ignored on release, and badly marketed as a horror film, The Prophecy, in this day and age of torture porn and slasher overkill, is crying out to be seen more by a jaded horror audience. For it be a film that has an interesting theological heart, that matches its daring and deeply provocative ideas. Here is a film that adds another chapter to the bible, the result being a battle for a soul on Earth that will have major repercussions for both heaven and hell. Gabriel (Christopher Walken) is even (poignantly some might say) using would-be-suicides as his unwilling helpers, their paths to peace blocked by Gabriel in his cunningly crafted intentions-yes this is pretty tight stuff indeed.Flecked with the odd bit of humour (zip code wise cracks for heaven and hell), Gregory Widen's film perhaps is guilty of not fully realising end of the world promise. But this is a minor itch come the finale, because really the picture should be judged as one complete and intelligent whole. Cast wise you will search in vain for a weak link, because there simply isn't one. Walken is suitably gargoyle like, slick black hair and pasty faced, he induces fear whilst simultaneously charming the beejesus out of the humans, re talking monkeys. Elias Koteas (a candidate for most undervalued actor of his generation), Virginia Madsen, Adam Goldberg (suicide Jerry), Amanda Plummer (suicide Rachael), Eric Stoltz (Simon) and Viggo Mortensen (Lucifer), all deliver top line performances to ensure the piece lives up to its billing as one of the best acted cult films from the 90s.It had enough support to warrant a direct to video franchise, with mixed results following each subsequent sequel. But it's here where it matters, a fine film that deserves far better than the bad reputation it gets from those who expected a straight out horror film. I urge anyone who hasn't seen it to give it a go, open your mind and hope Gabriel doesn't come a wandering in. 8/10 "},{"Title":"Unique","Date":"2 February 2005","Score":"22 out of 30 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Fantasy, Horror","Review":" Movies based on religious themes often tend to bore me quite severely. But this movie somehow did the trick. I guess it was the fact that it picked the right pieces from religious context and added the rest as it saw fit.There is a war in heaven between the angels. A stalemate has lasted for a long time and angels now come to earth to search for the soul that can end the stalemate and bring peace to heaven once again. Since the war began no souls have been let into either heaven or hell, so when the war ends these souls may finally find peace.The story here is quite insane really. Christopher Walken and Eric Stoltz are both angels who come to earth to look for a soul. Gabriel hates the humans because they are now gods favorites, not the angels. And Christopher Walken is quite magnificent as the dissatisfied angel. And the big reason that this movie works is the acting which is good throughout. Something that is not exactly a given thing in a movie like this.I guess this would by many people be called a b-movie. But i think the original plot and the acting lifts this quite a few notches. So watch this for something quite unique, but please stay away from the sequels that are not worth your trouble. I rate this 6/10.

Gabriel & his minons hate humans because of God's special treatment for humanity, and decides to hatch a sinister, and somewhat bizzare, plot to regain his place.  The plot twists are uneven, but an interesting story lies at the core.  Walken is wonderful as the anti-hero Gabriel, and Viggio Mortensen is a total hoot as Satan, Gabriel's rival.  Eric Stoltz's character is underdeveloped, as is the relationship between Elias Koteas and Virginia Madsen.    Director Widen gives his angels a refreshing cyberpunk/goth feel, rather like Tim Broadstreet's Vampire drawings - it is effectively disturbing to watch angels dressed like they belong to the Shotgun Mafia, instead of white sheets and feathered wings, but some will be put off by the contrast.  This moovie spawned a less-effective sequel, and rumor has it a third one is in the making!  You can tell Christopher Walken had a blast with this character, and that alone keeps the moovie interesting and effective.

Actually, the main attraction is Christopher Walken in the role of Gabriel. He's extremely entertaining with his mixture of humor and evil. He admonishes people for profanity! Of course, the theology in this movie is so preposterous it's hilarious. In movies like this (actually almost all movies) you aren't going to get Biblically-based stories, just a lot of mumbo-jumbo passed on as such. At least in the end, the hero of the film correctly identifies the warring angel as one doing so strictly out of jealously for God. That's Bibically accurate, but the rest of the theology here is totally bogus. You just hope people aren't gullible to believe this stuff. However, a lot of people probably don't know there are such things as bad angels, so that part is true.Theology-aside, this is a very entertaining movie. The language is tame but beware there are a couple of very gory scenes that might offend. The special- effects are good. Walken is a trip to watch and Virginia Madsen looks beautiful.

Soon enough he becomes involved in a fight between the angels Gabriel (Christopher Walken in one of his best roles) and Simon (an impressive Eric Stoltz) over an evil man's soul. A fascinating, atmospheric movie packed with interesting ideas, scenes and performances. Writer/Director Gregory Widen (only previous work of note 'The Highlander'!) really comes up with the goods in this one, which nods to both Milton and Garth Ennis while adding several original touches. Also co-stars Virginia Madsen ('Dune', 'The Hot Spot'), Amanda Plummer ('Butterfly Kiss', and Walken and Stoltz' co-star in 'Pulp Fiction'), and a small but memorable appearance by Viggo Mortensen ('The Indian Runner', 'American Yakuza') as Lucifer!

The story was made more interesting by the way they depicted the angels and the scene that Thomas Daggett saw inside the cave was horrific, with angels impaled on spikes, as far as the eye could see.

He had to leave the church, when he was tormented by horrific visions of angels warring with one another, tearing each other apart. Well, he asked for a sign from God, and that's what he got.And we all know what that means. Tom has the right information...he was just reading it wrong, because as it turns out, there IS a war going on in Heaven, he finally realizes. It seems that there's a faction of angels led by the archangel Gabriel (a dependably skeevy Christopher Walken) who aren't happy about the fact that The Big Guy has been showering favor upon human beings - giving them souls, allowing them into Heaven after they die...hey, WTF? Next He'll be giving them free frequent flyer miles! Well, Gabriel is right peeved about not being 'favored' anymore, and so are some of his closest buddies. Meanwhile, on the other side of the issue are the good angels, among whom Simon (Eric Stolz), Gabriel's ex-bud, counts himself. He's not happy about the situation, either, but he goes strictly by the book, literally he believes that what The Boss says, goes, and that's that, and Gabriel and his crew are in the wrong.So therefore, you have this War, which has been going on for some time when THE PROPHECY begins. To get the upper hand in the battle, Gabriel decides that what he needs to do is recruit the nastiest, vilest human soul that ever existed as a new general in the war...whose very entrance into Heaven will so upset the balance of power, it will result in not just Heaven and Hell flipping sides, but in the end of Mankind, which couldn't happen any faster for him.However, Simon gets to the soul before Gabriel does, and after a bloody struggle, hides it in the body of a little Indian girl named, ironically enough, Mary (Moriah Shining Dove Snyder), before he suffers a horrible death at his old friend's hands. Following some bizarre visions and leads of his own, Det. Daggett hooks up with Katherine Henley (Virginia Madsen), who is a teacher at the 'rez' grade school that Mary attends. Ta- dah! The stage is set for all kinds of weird stuff to happen, which of course it does, as Gabriel will stop at nothing to obtain the evil soul. Unless something or someone stops HIM. And that, kids, is an ending you will have to see to believe.Greg Widen (who co-wrote HIGHLANDER) has produced at the very least, a more original slant on the God-vs.-Satan/good-vs.-evil archetype than most movies have to offer. Since with this kind of material there's almost no such thing as going OTT, so Chris Walken is free to do more scenery-chewing than termites in a lumber yard, and he's great to watch. Ditto cameos by Adam Goldberg (SAVING PRIVATE RYAN) and Amanda Plummer, who both play - ready? - a reanimated suicide and a dying cancer victim, respectively, whom Gabriel uses to do his bidding. (Who knew that angels couldn't drive?)Koteas and Madsen do solid jobs, considering the whack jobs around them they have to deal with while preventing the advent of Armageddon. And thankfully, Snyder's Mary is a natural, not Linda-Blair'd to the point where the movie could've become an unintentional comedy.But the one thing you have to see is how and when the two heroes of the piece gain a very powerful, terrifying and unexpected ally against Gabriel and his plan. If you're sharp (and most of you are...like Jason's new machete), you'll know who it is. All I will say is that he's played to putrid perfection by Viggo Mortensen, in a special cameo he did way before THE RINGS TRILOGY and Peter Jackson blew his career up by nuclear proportions. It isn't often that somebody can out-creep Chris Walken as a very, very bad guy, but in this case Viggo delivers and then some, and it's a sight for sore (if not plucked-out) eyes!If you haven't had a crack at this one, I definitely recommend it. If you've seen it before but not in a while, why not pay THE PROPHECY another visit? Beats an idiotic remake any day...

These angels aren't the benign, mournfully watchful figures of Wings of Desire or City of Angels, let alone the make-a-wish do-gooders of Touched by an Angel. These are God's hit men, creatures that spend their whole existence praising God with one wing dipped in blood. They don't grant wishes, they don't make things better and you really, REALLY wouldn't want to see one. But, experienced as they are in laying waste to whole nations, they lack man's capacity for true evil and need to find the darkest human soul to show them the way to win. Viggo Mortensen's Lucifer isn't too keen on the situation, fearing a victory for Gabriel's side will result in Heaven becoming another Hell - and two Hells is one Hell too many for him. Stuck in the middle is Elias Koteas' priest-turned-cop, who lost his faith not because Heaven showed him too little but because it showed him too much.The similarities to writer-director Gregory Widen's Highlander screenplay are apparent, although this boasts a much lower budget but infinitely superior direction, a good visual sense and some great locations. Much of the film's strength is in its ideas and its dialogue the plotting is at times perfunctory, Virginia Madsen's schoolteacher takes little convincing of the Angelic threat and Walken probably has a little TOO much fun as Gabe, whether letting schoolchildren blow his horn or gleefully explaining I'm an angel. I kill firstborns while their mamas watch. I turn cities into salt. I even, when I feel like it, rip the souls from little girls, and from now till kingdom come, the only thing you can count on in your existence is never understanding why. The ending too is more than a little awkward. But the good points outweigh the bad.

The film reunites Pulp Fiction cast members Christopher Walken, Amanda Plummer and Eric Stoltz, and that's quite apt as this film is like a pulp fiction bible story. I dread to think what god fearing folk make of this movie, as we have popular bible figures such as Gabriel and Lucifer spitting out crass one liners and getting involved in punch-ups. Things like this make the film hard to take seriously, but it's also deliriously entertaining and the plot offers more than enough thought-provoking elements to keep the film ticking over nicely. The story follows a war in heaven, which was kicked off by the way that God decided to give souls to humans and not angels. The soul of an evil war general is the Holy Grail, and the Angel Gabriel has come to Earth in order to claim it. However, fellow angel Simon has had other ideas and has taken it upon himself to hide the soul from Gabriel.The cast is the film's main strongpoint. I'm not a big fan of films like this, but I had to see this one simply because it has Christopher Walken playing Gabriel. Walken plays the character a lot like he would a mob boss and it really works rather well as he ensures that every moment he is on screen is a treat, and of course, his screen presence is immense. The talented Virginia Madsen takes a lead role and finds herself paired up with the weak link of the cast, Elias Koteas who is flat and hard to like in his starring role. A pre-fame Viggo Mortensen delivers a memorable performance in the coveted role of the Devil and the central cast is rounded off by the charismatic Eric Stoltz. The story moves well, and it's real strongpoint is the way that it gives you enough to think about during the less exciting scenes by way of it's many plot points. The situation is brought to the screen well, and Gregory Widen's screenplay is good enough to ensure that every character is given enough screen time for us to get to know who they are. The special effects are fine and the film is well directed by Widen in his only feature film director's role.

With such notables as Virgina Madsen, Christopher Walken, Viggo Mortensen, Eric Stoltz and Amanda Plummer, this is the sort of thing that used to show up on Alex Cox's late lamented Moviedrome series in the UK.The story concerns a failed priest who is now a cop; which comes in really handy when he stumbles upon a murdered guy who just might come from up there. Soul transference, Angels that use the almost-departed as near dead servants, questions of faith, Indian exorcism rituals and an appearance by the head honcho himself, Lucifer. This is not your average popcorn flick! Surprisingly it all kinda works. apart from a bit of dodgy CGI near the end. Walken is excellent as Gabriel - he even has a scene teaching some children to blow his horn, causing a window in the nearby school house to shatter. During this moment he's actually searching for a soul he believes to be hidden in one of the children! If you're looking for something different, this might fit the bill.

You need some fresh ideas that can live past their shelf life of the 1980s without going into complete repetitive mode. With the Prophecy he has a sturdy script chronicling the lapse of faith with an ex-priest played by Elias Koetas and how he comes into the investigation of a series of crimes involving burnt up dead people and lots of signs pointing to a prophecy of thins involving the word dark.On the side of themes, things are fine. But he knew that his script needed some uplift and, as with Highlander, needed a star to carry it over past the genre fans. Christopher Walken was his key, and it's one of his true-blue Walken-iest performances. He's playing a supernatural creature of the underworld in the guise of himself, so he knows it's time to go to town, and he does. I can imagine Widen smiling to himself as he wrote such lines as Study your Math, kids, wherein Walken could sink his teeth in and make it an awesome nutbar of a performance. He still brings the creepiness when he needs (in this case all he needs to do as Gabriel is to stare), but it's the superfluous sense of humor, a timing that might be deadpan if it weren't for the evil angle, and it works wonderfully.The rest of the film is good, I should still say. This is one of those underrated 90s movies that has people who like it or don't, which is the way it goes sometimes (at the least, I would imagine, the first film has a better rep than the sequels, filling up a trilogy which is slightly inexplicable given the ending of this film). Actors like Virginia Madsen, Eric Stoltz, Adam Goldberg and Amanda Plummer take up very good space for what they need to do, but it's Viggo Mortensen who comes out on top as the most inspired casting after Walken. His scenes as Lucifer are tense but calm, if that makes sense, and he has that quality that one may have seen in De Niro in Angel Heart. He's so convincing as him that he makes his own a character that's been repeated countless times - and not just because of the Mother's feces line. He notches up the rank of a solid genre piece like the Prophecy into something of a kind of minor must-see - at least for those of us that will dig Mortensen in almost anything.

One such angel is malevolent Gabriel (Walken), coming to earth to stir up trouble and anger enemy Lucifer (Viggo Mortensen). Only former priest Thomas Daggett (Elias Koteas) really has a clue what's going on.Like I said, Walken makes the movie more than your average devil-themed flick. He turns Gabriel into a nasty but cool character, and it looks like Walken is having fun with the role. As it is, the movie wouldn't even need the rest of the cast, or any more dimensions to the plot; this is Walken's movie all the way. I recommend it, but understand that - despite the religious content - this isn't the sort of movie that's supposed to give you a religious experience. It's intended as a less-than-serious movie, and comes out very enjoyable because of that. Also starring Virginia Madsen and Eric Stoltz. A movie that you might want to watch along with this is Lord of Illusions (they came out around the same time, and I derived some similarities between the two).I wonder why religion-themed horror films always seem to focus on Roman Catholicism.

The movie is about angels, many of whom at war with each other and the main focus is concentrated on two angels Simon (Eric Stoltz), who is good and sweet-natured and Gabriel (Christopher Walken), who is basically bad to the bone.  The two angels know that there's a soul that can break the long-lasting stalemate and Simon gets to it before Gabriel does and hides it in a young Native American girl.  This also draws two humans into the battle, Thomas Dagget (Elias Koteas), an ex-seminary student who is now a homicide detective and Catherine (Virginia Madsen), a schoolteacher.  Viggo Mortensen is wicked as Lucifer.  This movie marks the directing debut of screenwriter Gregory Widen, who wrote the film's screenplay that has an amusing sense of humor.  The film's best move is casting Walken as Gabriel and it payoffs bigtime.

Rarely have sequels meshed so perfectly.  Each begins a short while after the previous.  The story flows seamlessly.  Walken is incredible as Gabriel.  He manages to be totally otherworldly and still ultimately believable. He exudes strength, and confidence, and his own unique brand of dry humour.  The premise of the movie does not in any way contradict the Christian Bible, or belittle religion, yet it still manages to be profoundly disturbing on a subconscious level.  There is no clear bad guy or good guy, only the shades of conflict we see in real people everyday.  If you're looking for Mr. Hero versus Boris Badinoff with a happy ending, you're looking at the wrong movie.  In the end end, I wanted to weep for Gabriel, I could sympathize with the devil, and could mirror the confusion and crisis of faith that Thomas was going through.  This not a movie for children, or for the intolerant.  I would recommend that anyone watching this one, watch all three back to back. You won't regret the time.  Whether you like it or not, you'll walk away looking at things just a little differently.

The highly religious will most likely hate this film for the same reason I love it, but if you can, try to at least see why they are painted this way in the film. Whenever God needed someone killed, he sent an angel, a life of devotion with one wing dipped in blood. Christopher Walken was perfectly cast as the angel Gabriel, searching for a soul to turn the tide of the war in heaven. The philosophies in this film are very good, as is the plot, acting, script and camerawork. A brilliant film for all to see, except maybe the overly religious, but give it a go, it deserves it.

The movie poses a question similar to that asked by a poet Zbigniew Herbert is the absolute, heavenly perfection the actual aim of God? Would a mere human being be able to confront the angelic perfection or live with it?If ancient gods were too human-like in their minor and major vices, the angels here are free of everything that can be considered human. Human - but also humane. They are _too_ superior for a human's view; they are relentlessly and mercilessly _perfect_. Too perfect to feel the way that human heart does.This may be why God ultimately choses people and not his first children, the angels. To the people He gives His love. The angels, however, will not accept that so easily...This is not a movie for children or infantile adults. They will never understand it and will only see a movie about angels thinking and behaving like street punks. To fully understand and appreciate God's Army - or Prophecy, as it is referred to in USA - one needs to possess knowledge of quite many subjects, as well as have a very specific model of soul and mind. To understand and enjoy this movie is a reason to feel proud of yourself, as you truly are what God intended you to be.

In a nutshell, it presents the idea of a second war in heaven which is all about... you guessed it... us humans. I'm not sure of its religious accuracy, but from a general mythological standpoint, it's entirely believable... like straight out of the pages of Homer. Beyond that I won't say anything because it's best to figure it out for yourself as the movie progresses.If this film were made with a bunch of forgettable actors, it would still be highly enjoyable. Like I said, the story is compelling, the suspense is thick, the soundtrack is cool, and the cinematography is majestic.But what makes this film positively PRICELESS is the all-star cast that breathe life, quirkiness and comedy into the flick. I'm not just talking about the incomparable Christopher Walken (whom we'll get to later) but also other veterans from Pulp Fiction made the year before Eric Stoltz (Lance in Pulp Fiction, Simon in The Prophecy), Amanda Plummer (Honey Bunny in PF, Rachel in Prophecy). Then there's Steve Hytner whom you might recognize as the lovably annoying Kenny Bania on Seinfeld (That's GOLD Jerry, GOLD!). And in his best role ever, there's Adam Goldberg (Chandler's psycho roommate on Friends) playing the role of Christopher Walken's suicidally-depressed, oozing sidekick Jerry.The entire film The Prophecy is like a who's who of the 1990s. And of course there's Viggo Mortensen (Aragorn from Lord of the Rings) who does a suave version of Lucifer. Seriously, these people didn't even need a script, they could've just sat in a room talking about sweet potato pie and it would be awesome.OK, back to Chris Walken. Simply HIS BEST ROLE EVER! I've seen him in everything from Deer Hunter to Dead Zone to Puss in Boots to Wedding Crashers, and I tell you he was born to play this role of Gabriel the Angel of Death. In his performance he brings that sinister Walken charm combined with flat-out riotous comedy and even spots of childhood innocence as only he can do (who would've guessed Archangel Gabriel can't drive a car). Walken carries us not only through this film but also through the two sequels with impeccable style. I mentioned how great the cast is, how great the story is, and how great the cinematography is, but really Christopher Walken was all it took to make me a believer.So don't hesitate to see this movie. I remember watching it in theaters when it first came out... it blew the audience away. And now 17 years later it's even better. What's great about this film is that each character is so freakin cool you gotta love each one, whether they're good or evil.The 1990s was THE DECADE for religious thrillers. After you watch The Prophecy, don't miss Exorcist III which has the same gritty vibe with spots of brilliant humor. Other films I'd compare this to are The Usual Suspects and another excellent Walken flick Suicide Kings.

Thomas is you could say a tad sceptical and says as much to Simon. Shortly after this meeting Simon is attacked by someone who jumps through the window of his first floor flat. During the scuffle Simon pushes the assailant back out the window to the street below, where the unfortunate is immediately hit by a car.Now bear with me here! Our car accident victim buddy has the triple whammy. Not only has he just been thrown out of a first floor window, but he is also then hit by a speeding car. Thennnnn, he is squooshed against a wall by the car to add injury to injury, to injury.My question is this. Let's play Devil's advocate here and say that in ordinary circumstances that this wasn't the 0.000000000000000001% of the time that a guy would happen to be falling from that window. That being the case that car was just going to smash into the wall anyway? (Very much like the recent Edge of Darkness where the lady steps out of the car onto a quiet road to be instantaneously cleaned up by another speeding car. Based upon normal probabilities there is an infantessimal chance that these things could be organised even if you tried.) Unless it is movie magic, so let's just agree that it was movie magic and move on you say? Done. You'll never guess who is called in to investigate the crime scene Thomas, that's who. Another digression You know it is a niche market when the force employs an angel specialist. You think he had many cases? Unless the TV show Touched by an Angel was far more literal a title than we thought all these years.Back to the crime scene. Thomas is a little surprised to find the victim lost his eyes, and not in the crash, he never had them. Also the hotel room has been trashed and when dusted for prints not one is uncovered, but Thomas's book on Angels is.Curioser and curioser.We cut to a remote school with a small group of students, Catherine (Virginia Madsen) seems to be the only teacher of the one class covering all ages and grades. Simon is now hiding out in a run down and unused part of the buildings.This town is where the bulk of the rest of the story takes place. To fast track matters Simon is now holding onto something that is much sought after by his yet unnamed rivals, and they want it. Bad.As every good film requires conflict we immediately get to meet the other interested party, his name is Gabriel and he was once the right hand man to God himself.Gabriel desperately wants what Simon holds, as he feels it will tip the balance in an Angelic war that has been waged for countless years in his favour. In Gabriel's eyes humans are no more than talking monkeys, and he detests us for how we are apparently viewed by God, feeling that angels have somehow received a bad rap.(Gabriel ends up coming into contact with almost every other main character and Walken seems to relish the chance to ham it up, after all no-one can say exactly how an angel should act can they? He spits out lines casually but is always menacing, and in fact some of his throwaway responses are actually hilarious.) Expanding on the simple premise above would result in much complication, none of which is necessary here, but know first that The Prophecy intertwines an intricately crafted backstory into what many believe, and does it very well. There are some great standalone scenes, minimum BOO! scares a powerful ending.Whether you believe in this stuff or not probably will have a bearing on what you think of the film. If you are already a believer the odds are that you will hate this or at least just take it as a fantasy story, I can't see why this would create anger in the religious community.If, like me you think this is all a work of fiction then you may find a lot to like here. Again I am an absolute sucker for theological elements in film so I lapped this up. I thought everyone in was effective, most notably Christopher Walken as a perfectly pasty and dare I say it otherworldly Gabriel, and Viggo Mortensen stole the finale with a bit part that veered close to parody but ended up suiting the tone of the film.The only negative I can throw at The Prophecy is that Gabriel and his undead lackeys were used to attempt to add some levity, only it felt quite out of place at times. Gabriel is perfectly amusing with most of his dialogue without forcing the issue with cartoony stuff.Final Rating - 9 / 10. One of my personal favourites. I just wish they didn't make 4 unnecessary sequels.If you liked this review (or even if you didn't) check out oneguyrambling.com "},{"Title":"Never Trust A Fu**ing Angel","Date":"9 April 2010","Score":"2 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Fantasy, Horror","Review":" Say what you will about Gregory Widen's 1995 offering, The Prophecy (not to be confused with John Frankenheimer's 1979 film, Prophecy), you've got to give it credit for originality. This loopy theological horror flick would have us believe that after the first war in heaven--the one that resulted in the angel Lucifer getting demoted and kicked downstairs--a second war was started, and continues to this day. In this war, Gabriel leads a band of renegade angels who are jealous of God's favoring the talking monkeys of Earth (that would be us), and is now planning to steal the soul of a psychotic, cannibalistic, Korean War colonel to fight on their side. Fortunately for us chattering simians, an ex-seminarian, now a homicide cop, and a pretty Arizona schoolteacher decide to make things tough on ol' Gabe.... Described by the coworker who recommended this picture to me as a guilty pleasure flick, The Prophecy is actually a highly imaginative, beautifully shot film laced with humor and featuring some first-rate performances. Elias Koteas and a young (and surprisingly brunette) Virginia Madsen are just fine as Thomas the cop and Katherine the schoolmarm, and Eric Stoltz (as the good angel Simon), Viggo Mortensen (as the foul-mouthed Lucifer; sorry, Mick, but I had no sympathy for this devil), Adam Goldberg (who many Friends fans will recall as Chandler's roommate from, uh, hell) as Gabriel's cat's-paw, and Steve Hytner (aka Seinfeld's Kenny Bania) as a very amusing coroner are all top-notch, as well. But it is Christopher Walken as the crazed Gabriel, of course, who steals the show here. By turns maniacal, funny, violent and charming, his is surely a performance to cherish. I just love the scene in which he brings the dying Amanda Plummer back to life in her hospital bed and greets her with a cheery Hi!

Other stars are Virginia Madsen as a schoolteacher and Viggo Mortensen (Lord of the Rings) as Lucifer. All of them play a great part in showing the relationship between angels, man, and god. Where things get a bit confusing is in Gabriel's search for the most evil human soul. Apparently this can act as some weapon against God, ultimately giving Gabriel his vengeance. The story behind the WHY or HOW of all of this really isn't given. The story just plays along showing the humans protecting the soul, which is hidden in the body of a little girl. The soul's location does well to get the audience to sympathize. Yet the whole possessed bit in the film feels off and a little weird.Otherwise, it's not a bad idea for a movie and certainly creative. And a great cast is there to deliver the goods.

Despite these flaws, however, this remains one of my favorite movies.The truth is, I hate the way angels are frequently portrayed in popular media fluffy, kind, humanity-loving, protective, distant-but-kindly or emotional-yet-always-mature, perfect, powerful beings who completely understand humanity and enjoy its little quirks. This movie does not do this. The angels in this movie -are- powerful, and that's fine. But they're also slightly alien, do not necessarily much care for humans or understand them, are quite willing to use them for their own ends, and are not at all perfect. It's revealed that some angels quite resent humanity -- which I think would be obviously the case. Even the angels that want to protect humanity do not necessarily do so out of any great love, but rather it's because what God says to do.Thomas Dagget, in the movie, has a little speech that about sums up how I feel on this topic that ends Would you ever really want to see an angel?I like this movie not because it's perfectly executed or brilliantly filmed or amazingly well-acted, but because despite its flaws and its somewhat deus ex machina ending it portrays something I feel is far more realistic about what angels might really be like than most other movies on this topic.

The movie would have been better served had the soul searching been replaced with a more unique gimmick. Second, the film would also have benefited with the absence of the Indian exorcists, who did nothing but shake feathers, chant mantras, and talk in that slow-paced, no-contraction English that Hollywood always has Native American actors speak in.

But Lucifer could have done without his diminutive, hooded, white-faced imp-assistant, who, apparently offended his boss in some fashion at one point, and became the object of a short but ferocious growl.

Not only does it cover some seriously controversial territory, it does so with style and an abundance of talented actors. I recall the first time I saw the movie back in the nineties and just how fascinated I was by the whole thing. Watching it now in a more critical way, I realise that it is certainly not without flaws, but nothing can take away just how interesting the plot is, nor how wonderful a couple of the performances are.Angels come to Earth to continue a war that has been raging in Heaven. The angel Gabriel seeks a soul that he will use to end the war and subsequently open a new Hell. The angel Simon also seeks the soul, but with the purpose of hiding it from Gabriel. It's not surprising that humans become entangled in this battle and it is left to a former priest and a little girl to stop Gabriel, with some help from the least expected of beings, Lucifer himself.This may all sound fairly ridiculous, and if you really study it, I guess it kinda is. But the style of the movie and the performances make it work. The angels are fascinating creatures. Their way of perching on top of things like a bird is such a simple way of distinguishing them and immediately marks them as different to the humanity surrounding. While the flashes of the war in Heaven may not look as amazing as a bigger budget may have allowed, it certainly gives the viewer an idea of the horror involved, with screaming angels dying upon massive spears.There is no doubt that Christopher Walken makes this film! He gives Gabriel such an amazing amount of charisma along with such a threatening persona. His regular sniffs, licks and head tilts are both disturbing and fascinating and every piece of dialogue that omits from his mouth is given life and importance. It's just a stunning portrayal of a powerful being and displays why he is such sought after villain these days. Eric Stoltz is also very good as Simon, yet he simply doesn't have the presence of Walken. Viggo Mortenson on the other hand displays his scene stealing abilities that would become even more prevalent as Arigorn years later. It's not often that an actor would get the chance to play the angel of darkness, and even less often that the character would be fighting on the same side as the movie's heroes. It's inspired writing combined with inspired casting.Although I obviously thoroughly enjoy The Prophecy, there are certain aspects that stop me from calling it a classic movie. I do feel the creators of the film did wonderfully well with the budget they had, but a movie of this scale could so easily have been made monumental with a bit more money for special effects and sets. Most of the film is situated in the desert, which is a rather strange setting for such a dark film. I can't help imagining how effective this plot would have been had it been located within a major city, with the heavenly battle breaking out into the lives of a large population. But that's being greedy.Some of the writing also could have been better. The occasionally dodgy dialogue is generally saved by the performances, but there are also quite a few plot holes and lack of explanation that stop the film from rising above being a very good B movie. But I don't want to nit pick The Prophecy too much, because it's a thoroughly entertaining and ambitious horror movie, sprinkled with comedy and action. If you're a fan of religious context horror or Christopher Walken, then this is a must see.

Christian folk ore is still popular among the common man, and his probably the first real fiction book ever printed. The creator of Highlander gave in this picture his own interpretation of devine matters.The plot pretty much is simple, the third war in heaven is raging on, for it happened again. Angels coming to a rebellion in heaven about us damn humans, and they start the third war in heaven. Leading the revolution, is this time the archangel Gabriel. He needs to seek the darkest soul on earth in order to win his war in heaven. However this is stopped by the angel Simon, who get's the soul before Gabriel does. Billions of people on this planet calls earth and as the angel Simon is dying he hides the soul in a human, as a last resort. Now a angry archangel Gabriel has come to earth to seek this soul, and will do anything to get it.I will say this is not the best picture about the subject ever made. Not even the most entertaining one, however it has something about it, it has a mood which you can't escape. The angels in this picture with their black eyes and dark coats look crimson and dreadful. The cast is not all that bad. Although Virginea Madsen and Elias Coteas are very average in their performance. The ones lifting up this picture are Eric Stolz, Christopher Walken, and Viggo Mortensen. Eric Stolz is not an A-performer, but he does what he is supposed to do, he is supporting. Although his character Simon hasn't much depth, he gives the role enough to let us see an angel who still treasures the morals of god. He plays in line, for he knows he is not the one pulling this movie, and his role isn't suppose to be pulling this movie. It is Walken who is pulling this, with his performance. Some will say this is his worst role, I would say, it is not his best. He is stereotyped, but who ever said that stereotyping doesn't work. Walken is believable as the crimson angel who has gone amok, that is what counts, and that is why he is pulling this movie, and is doing a good job. Not a 100% evil, but surely willing to erase human kind from this earth without remorse. Although in a very brief role, Viggo Mortensen pulls an almost brilliant Lucifer. He is almost pathetic, as he does in his actions (no poor acting though). Mortensen kind of creates a very humanistic Lucifer, not an evil demon lord, or monster type ruler, but a desperate angel trying to get recognition for his actions and existence.What is left is a mediumistic direction, not very impressive camera work, a low key production design, but some good special effects and on some parts art direction. All in all, 7, not brilliant, but this is just one you must have seen, for it's good intentions and efforts.

Every character in the film is essential to the story, and how they landed the talent is beyond me. Besides Walken, Elias Koteas is brilliant as Thomas Dagget, as is Adam Goldberg as Jerry.

Gabriel brings his closest henchman with him in the likes of Uziel (Jeff Cadiente)and likes to use near dead people as his personal slaves. The film is never slow, and builds to an epic end, thrills, chills, and Walken to boot, The Prophecy aims to please and delivers on every level.

As he can do it as almost no one can (Gary Oldman can smoke him in the evil department), his presence here is enough to make it an enjoyable experience. Very quotable. I rented this for a Halloween movie marathon this year and it failed to disappoint. An interesting point to take note of is the fact that three actors from Pulp Fiction make an appearance here. Eric Stoltz is fairly convincing in his role as one of the good angels, Simon. Also, Viggo Mortensen plays an excellently slick Lucifer complete with a Gothic gimp sidekick. If there is a personified devil, he must be Mortensen. The concept of a second war in Heaven fought over the fact that humans have souls is fairly amusing. Angels opening up cans on each other has never been so cool. The idea is for Gabriel (Walken) to find the blackest soul on Earth to win the second war in Heaven, which he started, but there are others who are trying to get to it first to prevent his victory. There are also a few tinges of humor thrown in there and there, mostly from Walken. Dark humor at it's best. I must admit though, without Walken this is a below average to average form of entertainment....however, since he is such a joy to watch, it chalks itself up to the average to slightly above average level. A must see for Walken fans. I suppose 7/10 would be quite right.

Walken himself was an excellent choice as the agitated, driven, and thoroughly insane angel Gabriel. His character was very obviously mentally disturbed, a real sociopath with no understanding of what is right or wrong, or the possible consequences of his actions. Viggo Mortensen's Lucifer is an excellent counterpoint smooth, slick, and plotting evil, compared to Gabriel's more chaotic, spastic, and uncaring vileness. The heroes' roles are almost nothing in comparison. Koteas's Thomas Daggett seems to almost too-easily accept the nature of the situation he's found himself caught in, though his background in the seminary and the visions that drove him from the priesthood make his acceptance of it much more believable.Walken's delivery of the character of Gabriel really dominates the movie, for the most part. He's energetic, and both hilarious and disturbing. His approach to acquiring and retaining his human aid can produce the most nervous of laughter, as he is personally very amusing, but he causes extreme suffering.Then Lucifer comes along, and really does steal the show. Mortensen sets the tone perfectly for the ending, because once all the laughter is over, there still is the matter of the homicidal Gabriel who refuses to stop chasing Daggett and his companions. Mortensen is oily and slick, a subtle Devil who breaks out foul threats and vile comments only when his composure is broken. He is a true anti-hero, providing the means to defeat Gabriel but only for his own reasons, and always ready to cause trouble himself once any alliance is no longer needed.

He is so weird looking that I had no trouble suspending my disbelief in regarding him as the Arc Angel Gabriel. However, the writer is the real hero here. Some of the lines are brilliant. This is not a spook movie. It has some real depth and asks some difficult questions about faith and the nature of God. Two of the four Arc Angels are represented here.

I particularly love the way Gabriel (Walken) shuts people up by putting one hand on their chest and another on his lip and uttering a simple shhh! as they collapse in a heap. What a concept!What I found particularly interesting was Gabriel's referring to humans as talking monkeys. Interesting how the makers of the movie seek to unite religion and science in an amiable blend of truth. Although I, personally, am not much of a fan of evolution, I think unity between science and religion is a very nice thing, and something worth striving for.In any case, despite the blasphemy (with respect to my faith and beliefs) contained within the underlying concepts on which this movie is based, it is wonderfully made and very entertaining.

VIGGO MORTENSEN does a sinister job as Lucifer, whispering his lines with a rasping intensity and making a vivid impression in a brief role.Like THE DA VINCI CODE, it takes religious elements and weaves them into a story of good vs. evil using angels in a way that is seldom ever done and making an intriguing tale of suspense based on the darkness of the human soul.CHRISTOPHER WALKEN has a great time as the Archangel Gabriel, ruling over everyone with a number of nasty lines and knowing winks, with overtones of humor throughout his devilish performance.Strictly for horror fans who want their imagination to turn on a different sort of fantasy with religious motifs--the sort of horror film that some will find offensive and other will enjoy tremendously.Summing up Good, intense performances from the entire cast.

Walken and Mortensen are amazing in this. The direction is OK, but the writing... It just feels like the writer (and the director) had some good ideas but didn't really want to put any time into their development. Even though I love overall concept and some characters, I'd really love to see more quality dialogue and character development. When it comes to dialogue and character interactions it feels like it was written by a 5 y.o.

The pure spooky atmosphere and delicious lead performance on display here is enough to forgive the film it's setbacks, of which it has a few. It doesn't fully explain or flesh out its mythology, and gets a bit hazy. But it compensates with a vividly drawn tale of the heavens and the underworld at war on earth, in an ambient style punctuated by eccentric character beats and an overall tone of a well spun campfire tale. Christopher Walken is scary intense as the Angel Gabriel, tossed out of heaven and deposited on earth like a castaway, forced to dwell among us monkeys and meat suits. He has a vague plan (like I said, the writing could have harnessed the plot together a bit more) to find the most evil soul in human history, implant it in the body of a specific child, and incite another unholy war between angels and demons to rock the universe to its foundations. A big city cop (Elias Koteas) catches wind of the otherworldy plot and pursues. He's led to a backwater New Mexico town that Gabriel has turned his attention too. It's a muddy, convoluted yarn, but don't get me wrong, I freakin love it. Walken seems to Emory the weirdness and wild, 'scream at the stars' anger of the jaded cherub perfectly, giving him a heart of evil obsidian glass and a mind to carry out his plan no matter how many races he has to decimate to do so. Virginia Madsen fills the female lead nicely, and there's supporting work from Amanda Plummer, Glenn Danzyg, Eric Stoltz, and a brief but wickedly memorable turn from Viggo Mortensen, playing Lucifer. He owns his cameo with repulsive, terrifying gusto. It's not a perfect film, but in the long run of similar outings (Legion, Constantine etc.) it's one of the best. The alluring air of mystery and fantastical elements always get me. As for the sequels, the first two are cool because they still have Walken... but avoid the last two, they're awful.

Of all the names of angels they had to choose from when picking their bad guy who wears the black hat (in this case, the bad angel with greasy black hair), I couldn't help but wonder why the writer selected the name of Gabriel, our local universe's chief executive and the personal rep of the Sovereign Son known best in our planetary neck of the woods by the name given at birth in Bethlehem, Jesus. The Lucifer Rebellion began around 200,000 earth years ago and it was certainly no exaggeration when they referenced this as being a war in heaven where angels needed to listen to both sides of the argument as presented by Gabriel vs. Lucifer before making a final decision as to which side of the proverbial fence of Good vs. Evil they wholeheartedly desired to wind up on. But Gabriel is the mighty and steadfast Warrior representing God who exposed The Lucifer Manifesto for what it really is, a treacherous pack of lies. When I read a detailed account of Lucifer's ludicrous propositions as spelled out in his unholy declaration of war against God, I was amazed that one who was created a few levels above our paygrade could sink to such lowly depths of depravity even sparing not the Jerusem kids in the probationary nursery on the finaliter's world (those precious little ones from planets like ours who died too soon) from being exposed to his repulsively repugnant pitch of death deceptively disguised as something else. But once I started taking my attention away from the names of characters, I wound up being more than just entertained by the acting and the over-acting. In the end, I realized that The Prophecy tells a story about faith where men and women and angels are free to determine their individual destinies by the faith-filled or faith-deficient choices they make.

So I'm going to go through it again. The Prophecy walks a seriously thin line between campy horror and twisted story that could have fell flat on its face. The amazing thing is that it works and works so incredibly well. It turns in the type of film that was likely instantly a cult classic. There are some incredible and truly quotable lines in the film and scenes that will stay with you (hauntingly so) for a long time after that. There are some cheesy moments and yet the film is so dark and twisted that the cheese somehow blends in together and provides you with an eye opening and unique horror flick that I really enjoyed. I think great horror/thrillers can come out of Christian theology (some of Stephen King's most brilliant stuff certainly does) and The Prophecy does an incredible job of spinning this yarn around that and laying the groundwork for a series. The casting works so well and everything in this puzzle just fits together right. It is one of those films I think that you can't necessarily pinpoint why it works but it just does.Christopher Walken is a legend in his own right so I will start with him. Is he a great actor? Honestly, no I don't think that he is. But you cannot deny his unbelievable on screen charisma. He seems just a perfect fit to play this almost campy and yet dark and twisted evil Angel. This is probably one of his most memorable roles to me and for good reason. Walken is very Walken in the role and it works really well. Under-rated character actor Elias Koteas is disgraced Priest turned cop Thomas. This character is just fantastic. He is the perfect hero and Koteas does this brooding cop who is having the ultimate crisis of faith. His dialogue in the film is so well written and this script is shockingly smart at times. Koteas and Walken have this awesome rivalry that really drives this film. Virginia Madsen plays a character that is both necessary to the story and yet I felt she got in the way in some ways. She doesn't give as strong of a performance as everyone else but I understand why she's there. She doesn't really stand out though. Eric Stoltz, Viggo Mortensen, Adam Goldberg and Moriah Snyder deserve mention amongst the supporting cast. Stoltz and Mortensen border on being amazing and yet their roles are painfully small and not to be repeated by them in future instalments of the series.The one thing I took from The Prophecy more than anything else was the imagery. My God! Writer and director Gregory Widen had some messed up vision for this film and it translates onto the screen and gets under your skin. Whether its the tortured angels, the death scenes, the war, or the transferring of souls...the metaphorical imagery is deeply disturbing and effective. I'm shocked Widen didn't have more of a directing career after or before this and even more shocked that a writer actually managed to translate this into something really great. I have no doubt the series will gradually fall apart with future parts but I am going to stick with all of them and review each one because I thought this first one was just excellent and will absolutely remain high on my list of horror classics. 8.5/10 "},{"Title":"Great Cast & Story = Under rated 90's Horror Movie","Date":"15 March 2014","Score":"","Genre":"Action, Fantasy, Horror","Review":" There is a war going on in heaven between the angels.

Gabriel is fast on its trail as Dagget and the girls' school teacher (Madsen) do their best to protect her. This very original horror film from Writer / Director Gregory Widen is a serious tale that is quite a fun ride to take. Widen fills his story with adult characters and real stakes are at cost. The film has a great look and a subtle sense of humor that helps. Walken as the fast talking Gabriel is perfect and is quite humorous at times but can be truly scary and menacing in the next minute. Eric Stoltz as Simon the good angel is solid and Elias Koteas as Thomas is the backbone of the movie. The always under rated Virginia Madsen brings her usual spunk to the role of the protective school teacher, and Viggo Mortensen as Lucifer himself is memorable in a small but spicy role. Widen keeps the movie interesting and at a good pace so the audience is engaged with the characters and a few chills are delivered along the way.

To that end, Gabriel desperately needs the dark soul to help break the stalemate between his army and that of the archangel Michael. With that in mind, Thomas Dagget (Elias Koteas) has been studying to become a priest but because of disturbing visions renounces his calling at the last minute and ends up as a police detective instead. As luck would have it, he and an elementary school teacher named Katherine (Virginia Madsen) are thrown into the war of the angels as they seek to protect a young girl named Mary (Moriah Snyder) who unwittingly harbors the dark soul. Anyway, what transpires is a bizarre hide-and-seek story with all sorts of Biblical names and references (of questionable origin) thrown in. For example, Thomas relates that he is disturbed by a Biblical passage in which St. Paul states, Even now in heaven there were angels carrying savage weapons. And he should be disturbed&#x97;because there is no such quote in the Bible. Fortunately, his bewilderment is dissipated after he stumbles upon a book containing the 23rd chapter of the Book of Revelation which pretty much explains everything. As it should, obviously, since Revelation normally ends at chapter 22. Naturally, there are other angels and angles thrown in as well. In any case, both Elias Koteas and Christopher Walken put on excellent performances and there were some decent action scenes thrown in for good measure. Be that as it may, even the best acting can't make up for the extremely ludicrous pseudo-religious drivel the story is based upon. Quite embarrassing, actually.

Things get stranger when a mysterious figure called Gabriel appears, and the trail leads to a little girl called Mary living in rural Arizona. What in Heaven's name is going on ?This is a great little scary movie, a production from the always interesting Dimension Films company, brilliantly written and directed by Widen with wit, originality and loads of good ideas. Okay, it may be more than a little crazy, but who cares - it's so interesting, great fun and an almost perfect balance of religious parable, goofy comedy and action mystery. The depiction of the angels in particular is spectacular; their bird-like perching, olfactory capabilities and curious limitations (they can't drive) are both intriguing and funny. Walken takes these ideas and runs with them, turning in an amazing, unforgettable performance, but the whole cast really get into it, and Koteas as the Doubting Thomas investigator somehow manages to make sense of the increasingly bizarre events. The film has some low budget limitations - the effects are imaginative but struggle to convey the scale of the story - but it has so much going for it it doesn't matter. If you think about it, angels almost always make for good cinema, whether it's A Matter Of Life And Death, It's A Wonderful Life, Wings Of Desire, The Crow, Dogma, even Michael or City Of Angels - I can't think of a boring movie about angels. Theological ideas often come over well in films, whether it's because of special effects or character contrast I'm not sure, but they are endlessly fascinating figures and this film particularly paints them in a wholly unique light. Just to be complicated, this movie has spawned four direct sequels (the first two of which also feature Walken) and should not be confused with the (bad, but fun) 1979 John Frankenheimer movie Prophecy. Unfortunately, this is Widen's only directorial effort; a shame given how much talent he obviously has - he also wrote Highlander (great story) and Backdraft (rubbish story). We live in a religiously dynamic and diverse world, yet the concepts rarely find their way into mainstream cinema. Horror movies on the other hand have a long, rich and continuous thirst for matters Divine, and this is one of the best and most enjoyable such pictures. A great film from Widen, shot in evocative desert locations in Gila County, Arizona. And remember kids - study your maths !

There is some striking and unsettling imagery and the Cinematography is excellent.It has a strong creepiness factor and the rather successful effect of the whole Film is tethered to an unforgettable, black-humored performance from Chris Walken as Gabriel. Most of the films quotable lines come from his striking study of a powerful and befuddled Angel.This is an offbeat Movie that gains reputation with each passing year, having been mostly ignored upon release. A true Cult Movie that has grown in stature by word of mouth and rabid fans of crazy concepts and intelligent execution. If the Film has a strong weakness it is the ending that seems a little too Hollywood and little too hokey. But up until the final scene or two, this is one of those that has been misunderstood and overlooked. The sequels are not in the same league as this gem and can be avoided without penance.

Eric Stoltz is adept at his role as Simon, the angel from the forces loyal to God's will concerning man. Christopher Walken is the perfect Gabriel, smiling and deceptive, treating us talking monkeys with the same sort of casual disdain as one may treat a retarded child. Virginia Madsen plays the lone teacher for what remains of an abandoned mining town, and she portrays the role in such a manner as to have us believing she has taught school for years. While the remainder of the cast is proficient and talented in their roles, special mention has to be made of Viggo Mortensen as Lucifer. He delivers his lines with such precision of depth and directness, you can believe he is the devil incarnate. Rated R for violence, gore and language, this is truly a work of art. Collectible as the first in a series of five films, or by itself as just an incredible work of fiction and the imagination of Gregory Widen.

The story just seemed rushed and condensed, it was boring at times with below average affects. I was disappointed by this movie. Christopher Walken is the main reason this movie has a 50&. He was basically able to make this movie seem somewhat interesting. His performance was decent, to me it felt like he was trying for this movie to at least seem adequate. It shares some history from the Bible and among other things Angels. The methods that the Angels performed were disturbing, it just did not make any sense. The whole basis of the plot is, there is a man on this earth who was in the Vietnam war, he possesses the blackest soul on the face of the Earth. In order for the Angel Gabriel (Walken) to win this battle, he must take possession of this soul. However this event is intervened when another Angel seeks to end this war by protecting this soul. He then places it in a young girl named Mary. At this point the action begins. The actions scenes are small and hardly seem worth it. They are rushed and fast paced. It becomes difficult to realize what had just happened. The talking scenes are drawn out as well, you soon become bored easily. There really is no feel or atmosphere at all to this flick. As soon as you get somewhat interested in it, the movie ends leaving you feel left out. The ending was the part that bothered me the most. It just seemed like the director did not care one bit and slapped this ending on last minute. It really bothered me because of the lack of action and information. Overall this movie is decent, but not worth the time. If your a Christopher Walken fan, you will probably enjoy it, but if not chances are it will just be a miss on the awesome movie scale. So 50% for the squandered cast this movie has and for the dry action scenes.

Finding an ancient bible among the victim's belongings, he begins to translate it and finds that it contains a previously-unknown chapter detailing a second war in Heaven among angels. On an Indian Reservation in Arizona, teacher Katherine Henley, (Virginia Madsen) thinks that something's wrong with her children, and it leads Det. Daggett to the area. Also racing to the area is Gabriel, (Christopher Walken) a renegade angel wanting to restore Heaven to it's former past. Investigating the appearance of the angel and the sudden chaos in the town, they band together to stop the renegade angel from unleashing a war on Earth that will tear apart Heaven above.The Good News This one is pretty decent. One of the film's best attributes is that it has some really fresh and creative ideas that are, for once, interesting and memorable. The notion of what angels actually are, with one memorable line of dialog in particular summing up what they're actual purpose is for that is one of the most distinctive and important parts of the film. The originality of it makes it so important, as it's a side that seems like it would've been interpreted as such much earlier, as it's logical but also clever and it earns big points for being so. The back and forth nature of the story keeps the suspense pretty high, allowing for some really good action scenes. The fight in the apartment room is a big highlight, and a really good car chase is the icing on the cake to it's conclusion, a climactic showdown in a ceremonial Indian hut that is quite gory and never loses any of it's punch. The gore here is quite nice, with several hearts ripped violently out of the chest, a charred skull that keeps on talking, glass shards stuck into throats, a huge slew of gunshot wounds, and more. This is quite violent and gory, which is in perfect keeping with the method of disposal needed for the participants in the war. The scenes depicting the war, showing angels being impaled on row after row of spikes by the thousands, blood drenching the ground and more fighting above them, are effectively haunting and quite creepy, and their periodic use throughout is used to it's benefit, making the images clearly there to freak out, and the purpose is handled greatly. This one is quite nice overall.The Bad News This does have a few problems. It is a rare thing that a horror film is conducted with literacy and intelligence, but this one suffers from being too smart for it's own good. There's such a large amount of plot-holes and goofs here that it is quite a headache trying to piece everything together. The storyline defies logic, as if Gabriel is God's appointed angel of war, why would he need the darkest soul on earth to aid him? Why not simply use his own power and influence to wreck havoc, especially since he also has the power to resurrect dead humans as zombies who are forced to follow him? It was never said what Gabriel needed the colonel's soul for. These are just a few of the film's many headache-inducing questions that don't get answered. There's also a big pacing problem, as it is certainly a film that asks patience of an audience. It is a good half-hour into the film before the often wilfully cryptic plot strands begin to coalesce and one begins to properly understand what is going on, and even then, the plot has one or two strands that are left unwound. Scenes are often left going on far too long, with an encounter in a school-house basement being the prime example. Others are simply there for no reason, as it's not exactly necessary for the plot to have an angel conversing with people inside a diner. These bring the film down from what it could've been.The Final Verdict I can't vouch for how accurate it is, but it's still a mildly entertaining film with a few good ideas and a few that shouldn't have been there. With a little more thought put into an already over-thought film, this would be a better film, but it's hard not to be entertained by it. Give it a shot if it sounds interesting.Rated R Graphic Violence, Language, Brief Nudity and intense religious themes "},{"Title":"Original, cool and clever film!","Date":"19 July 2006","Score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Fantasy, Horror","Review":" Gregory Widen may be better known as the writer of the famous fantasy movie Highlander, where he introduced us to a wide universe so rich that has expanded to many different kinds of media and is now a classic of the genre. Now on the director's chair, Widen attempts to create a similar experience mixing horror and fantasy in The Prophecy, giving us a world where Angels and Demons fight a war that has been going for the destiny of mankind.The Prophecy is the tale of the second war in heaven, a war that has been going on for centuries. Unlike the first war that happened when Lucifer (Viggo Mortensen) attempted to become God, this one is led by Gabriel (Christopher Walken), whose only wish is to destroy mankind so angels can be again God's favorite creations. While the war has been balanced for centuries, now Gabriel has the chance to have the upper hand in the conflict as he discovers in Earth the most evil human soul ever created. The angel Simon (Eric Stoltz) discovers this and decides to find the soul first, for this he'll need the help of Detective Thomas Dagget (Elias Koteas), a former priest turned cop. Now the battle is on Earth.Widen once again proves he has a talent for fantasy as he takes a familiar concept and expands its many possibilities. The concept of a war between angels is very interesting and Widen takes full advantage of the Judaic and Christian religious symbols to tell his story. While the plot is probably not as polished as his Highlander, Gregory Widen makes up for it with a collection of interesting and original twists to familiar biblical characters that together make a very enjoyable ride.On the director's position, Widen looks a bit unexperienced, although this is natural as his only previous job as a director was a Tales from the Crypt episode. Sadly, this takes its toll on the movie, as at times it has the looks of a straight to TV movie and this hurts the quality script he had developed. However, it is worth to recognize that Widen did a good job with his relative low-budget, and many of the special effects still look convincing despite its age.As many have pointed out, the film strongest point is the amazing cast. Christopher Walken does wonders with this pulp novel version of the archangel Gabriel. He completely creates a character that is both charming and frightening, with his suave persona owning the screen. Eric Stoltz is also wonderful as Simon, and his expressive face says more than the few lines his character has. The weakest link is definitely Elias Koteas, who ends up a bit flat and wooden, although in his favor one can say that Widen underdeveloped his character in comparison with the angels. Viggo Mortensen, Virginia Madsen and a wonderful Adam Goldberg complete the terrific cast that has earned the movie a cult-status.Despite all this, The Prophecy is not without problems, and the most notorious is the lack of experience of the director. While his story is considerably good and for his fortune, the cast does wonders with the material; his directing style is non-existent and very simplistic, very much like an episode of a typical TV series in the vein of the X-Files. Still, one can overlook said flaw due to the many other wonders this film has to offer.While it doesn't have the massive appealing of Highlander, this movie is a terrific addition to the fantasy/horror sub genre and another prove of the very imaginative mind of Gregory Widen. On a word of advice, the sequels are not as good as the first one although if you enjoy this one the rest will be very attractive as Widen's new world seems very appealing. Definitely worth a rent. 7/10 "},{"Title":"Very good movie...","Date":"12 January 2001","Score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Fantasy, Horror","Review":"   I'm not really a big believer in Christianity or the Bible, but I found this movie to be very good. Christopher Walken, Eric Stolz, and Elias Koteas gave especially good performances. Walken plays Gabriel. The notorious angel of death who goes against god when he becomes afraid of getting replaced by talking monkeys. He opposed Lucifer once, but now seems doomed to become just like him. Despite being the killer of first borns, he does have a tender side. When it all comes down to it, he only wants his creator's love and he'll do whatever it takes to be the one loved above all. Selfish, but for good reason.  Our heroes are Simon Stolz) and Thomas Dagget (Koteas). One of them is a good angel who opposes Gabriel, even though they were good friends before the war. The other, Dagget, is a failed priest-turned-homicide detective who has lost his faith in the word. Rounding it out, we have a school teacher, possessed native american child, and a suicide victim being kept from his death.    The upsides to the Prophecy is a fast paced story where a lot of things happen. The characters are all good. The film is well directed. The score has it's cool points. It has a lot of good humor. And it has a moral to the story that could possibly turn someone back on to Christianity....not me, but probably someone else. For a religious person, this film could be either offensive or a senti-mental favorite. We also have Lucifer appearing...the best version of Lucifer I've seen on film. Pacino comes close. The downsides is that the film is unbalanced. Much happens in the first half, but the second half seems to drag. The score has it's annoying parts, among the good ones.

And the scenery surrounding the Indian village is undoubtedly spectacular but, again, not really the location where we would expect to see what turns out to be a disappointingly small scale showdown.What has gone right, however, is Christopher Walken playing Gabriel as some sort of supernatural Mafia thug. Walken is playing according to type, of course, but it is still tremendously entertaining to watch him do it.

Now he's a detective who gets called in on a murder case when a copy of his priestly thesis on angels is found at the scene. Thomas finds a body that has no eyes, both sets of sex organs, blood like a fetus and bones unlike any living thing on Earth. He also finds a handwritten bible from the 2nd century that has an extra chapter of Revelations, one that tells of a terrible war in Heaven where angels rebelled over God's love of Man.His investigation leads Thomas to a dying town in Arizona, where a choir teacher named Katherine Hammond (Virginia Madsen) is worried about a little girl named Mary (Moriah Shining Dove Snyder), who's been sick ever since she met a strange man named Simon (Eric Stoltz). Except, Simon isn't a man. He's an angel and he's trying to keep the Archangel Gabriel (Christopher Walken) from finding something he needs to win the war in Heaven and displace Man as God's favorite creation. With help from an unlikely source, Thomas and Katherine have to protect Mary and end the angelic war.The best way to describe The Prophecy is to say that the stuff in this movie that works, really works, but there's a lot of stuff in the film that doesn't work at all. Widen creates an amazingly textured angel mythology that doesn't just deal with what they are but how they act, think and feel. What George Romero did with zombies, that's what Widen does with angels. There's a bit in the story about how Gabriel finds dying people and keeps them alive to serve him doing dumb monkey work like driving a car which Gabriel feels is beneath him. It's a little detail in this story, but you could make an entire movie out of that idea. That's the level of care and attention that Widen brings to that element of the movie.Christopher Walken, Eric Stoltz and Viggo Mortensen also do excellent jobs playing characters that are both more and less than human. Walken is particularly outstanding with a role that's always balanced on the edge of self-parody. He embraces the excessive aspects of Gabriel and channels them in a way that keeps the audience on its toes.This is also a good looking film. It's very stylish without looking stylized. From the angels on Earth in their long coats to Heaven's fields of the dead to the simple image of an old man standing behind a young girl, Widen has a distinct vision that is appealing without becoming labored or overwhelming.Unfortunately, things go wrong when Widen crams into the story two human characters that neither he nor the viewer really care about. There's nothing wrong with Elias Koteas or Virginia Madsen, but the characters of Thomas and Katherine are non-entities. They never do anything and aren't needed. This movie could have focused entirely on the angels and it would have been fine, but either Widen or his producers obviously thought there had to be some normal characters for the audience to identify with. It's hard to identify with characters that stand around while stuff happens around them.The Prophecy has one of the dumber endings you'll see, as well. The story poses a lot of compelling moral, ethical and theological questions, then resolves them by hitting a guy in the head with a crowbar over and over. It's like they ran out of time to come up with something, so they borrowed the ending they saw on an episode of the A-Team the night before filming the final scene.The Prophecy is a lot like Highlander. There are things in this movie you will absolutely love and there are things that wither and die on screen like a plague victim. This is one of those films that was made for DVD, so you can get watch the good bits and forget about the rest. "},{"Title":"The Army of Angels is all here... But where's God when you need him?","Date":"29 September 2008","Score":"","Genre":"Action, Fantasy, Horror","Review":" The Prophecy is one of the better and undoubtedly one of the most ambitiously plotted horror movies of the 1990's. In a decade where most horror movies were mere uninspired imitations and/or sequels in franchises that already outstayed their welcome, writer/director Gregory Widen (co-creator of the original Highlander) comes up with a uniquely original and complex religious thriller dealing with fallen angels, the Second War in heaven, soul-sucking, angel autopsies and former priests turned cop slowly regaining the lost faith. The atmosphere of the film is pitch black and sinister and, even though there are copious opportunities to revert to a simple occult horror movie with a lot of gory killings and nasty images, Widen always makes sure the emphasis remains on coherent storytelling and characterizations. When inspector Thomas Daggett is called to the morgue to look at a super-human corpse, little does he know he's about to become involved in the greatest spiritual showdown in history. The Second War of Heaven has moved down to earth, with the ultra-malignant (but über-cool) fallen archangel Gabriel hunting down the evil soul of a deceased war criminal. If he takes possession of this soul, Gabriel is destined to win the battle upstairs, so the good angel Simon tries to prevent this by hiding the soul elsewhere. The plot, albeit obviously very fantastic and far-fetched, is intriguing and there are enough twists to keep you alert at all times. The character drawings are detailed and very well done, as you feel like you know enough about the evil characters as well as the good ones. Most amusing aspects about The Prophecy, however, are the really ingenious parts/gimmicks of the screenplay that aren't even that essential to the main story lines. For example, Gabriel requires a human assistant to drive him around and stuff, and for this job he uses suicide victims that are about to step into the light. This often leads to very funny situations. Another highlight is the appearance of no one less than Lucifer himself near the end of the movie. You see, there are a whole lot of angels &#150; good or bad &#150; present here; the only party guest missing is God himself. The cast is overall splendid with terrific roles for Elias Koteas, Virginia Madsen, Eric Stoltz, Adam Goldberg and Viggo Mortensen. The absolute star of the entire Prophecy franchise, and especially this first and superior installment in particular, naturally is Christopher Walken. He's stupendous as Gabriel and continuously balances between blackly comical and genuinely petrifying. Walken is probably one of the only actors who can make you laugh and shiver with fear at the same time. Some of his one-liners here are simply priceless. Example; when someone condemns him to hell, he arrogantly replies with It's heaven&#133; The least you could do is getting the zip-code right. Followed by two inferior sequels also starring Christopher Walken and two more that I haven't bothered to see yet.

I could not easily begin to explain it right now, but it's easy to understand while you're watching it. I am agnostic and don't like movies that deal with religion, but it is often interesting to see it on film and how different people view it.possible spoilers...This is not your basic good versus evil type of film. It deals with a storyline that is completley original. Neither good nor evil is good nor is either of them evil. Hard to explain what I am saying, but watch the movie and you will understand.

Typically, the movies either sentimentalize angels (as in It's a Wonderful Life), or trivialize them (as in The Kid with the Broken Halo), or both (as in Date with an Angel). But angels are powerful beings and alarming presences in the Bible, they often have to introduce themselves with an admonition not to be afraid of them, and a siege of Jerusalem was lifted when 185,000 Assyrian soldiers were killed by a single angel in a single night.The Prophecy depicts human-looking angels who are powerful, inscrutable, dangerous... and hostile to the human race, whom they refer to as talking monkeys.  It's hard to tell the angels from the fallen angels here. Christopher Walken looks like cadaverous drag queen as Gabriel, inaccurately identified as the angel of death.Nor is that the only inaccuracy.  Early in the flick, our hero, a NYC cop and former candidate for the priesthood, says that of all the Gospels he remembers most clearly, it's where St. Paul says that the angels in heaven still carry savage weapons.  In fact, Paul neither wrote any of the four canonized Gospels, nor appears in them, nor is quoted in them; he doesn't turn up until the Book of Acts.  Nor is there any reference to savage weapons in any of the Gospels, nor in any of Paul's letters, nor anywhere else in the New Testament.Next, a Bible turns up which is carbon-dated to the 2nd century AD. Problem it's in Latin.  St. Jerome didn't translate the Bible into Latin (the Vulgate) until the 4th century.  But there was, in the 2nd century, an Old Latin translation, so I'll cut them some slack on the Latin.  But not on the fact that it's a book, and not a scroll.  Nor on the fact that, in the 2nd century, the canon hadn't yet been agreed upon, so The Bible, as such, didn't yet exist.  Nor on the fact that the illumination in the book is distinctively Celtic, a la the Book of Kells, whereas Ireland wasn't Christianized until several centuries later.  Finally, our cop translates an apocryphal 23rd chapter of the Book of Revelation, coming up with such non-Johannine words as Lucifer and references to eating souls.  In a word, BS.The scripter unfortunately also needed to do his homework about the basics of screenwriting.  The Prophecy is plodding, talky, and ultimately boring, with attempts at dark humor that are just forced.  The unlikely story centers around the effort by Gabriel to retrieve (for incoherent reasons) the soul of recently-deceased old soldier.  This man was supposedly--and unconvincingly--the worst person in the universe for having committed atrocities in Korea years earlier.  The purloined soul has been stashed into a little American Indian girl, to the befuddlement of the local medicine man, and Gabe has to retrieve it at any cost.  Satan puts in an appearance as well, looking like a biker with clean hair.  What a mess.Not content with being convoluted, The Prophecy is also cheesy what could have been spectacular vistas of battles in the war in Heaven simply fail to materialize, and one vision of a host of impaled angels is a static, amateurish painting!  All told, the movie is frustrating, a dull, shabby handling of what could have been a better-researched and better-written story.

It was very clear that these weren't men.  Christopher Walken, in particular, did a great job of it.  I loved how, even though we didn't see them with wings, they all seemed to perch and land when they moved.  The neutral nature of the angels was also an interesting view.  Even though some were doing horrific things, none of the angels were truly evil.

This is not a bad piece of work, but it seems to drag along at times and makes the mistake of including Catholicism.It seems that most Bible-inspired movies involve man-made Catholic traditions.  The implication from Hollywood is that Catholicism is most legitimate (because of the Church's size?), which seems so far from the truth in my opinion.  Movies with man-made Catholic traditions appear to be pure fiction to me.  They lack credibility in my eyes.  As a Christian, I took no offense to this movie because it is as far out there as Superman.To those who dislike this purely because it involves Christianity and the Bible, I fail to understand the complaint.  Many non-Bible-inspired stories involve whole new universes, with different beliefs, values, etc.  I don't hear anyone complaining about those.  For example, you don't have to believe in the story behind the Lord of the Rings to enjoy the books.Our world of about six billion people has about two billion Christians.  That is 1/3 of the world's population!  It's the largest religion on the planet.  You should expect to see some Christian-based movies every now and then.

Please, Walken is (as he said himself in True Romance) pure evil personified, and Viggo (Satan) is great, but simply is out of his league (like everyone else) in the evil department against Walken.The only living person who could do Satan here and convincingly take down Walken's Gabriel is Robert De Niro (his Satan in Angel Heart was evil itself, the only possible match against Walken), but this being a low budget film, most likely cannot possibly get both Walken and De Niro, so has to settle for one, and since Gabriel is the true villain (Satan has 5 minutes of screen time at most), the director did the best he could (be better if Thomas had taken down Gabriel himself, by not having Satan and Gabriel share the screen, Viggo would appear much more evil simply as and advisor to Catherine and Thomas)And one last thing Viggo should've being aged like 20 years, since in the film the older looking angels are more powerful than the younger looking ones (Gabriel is the oldest looking, therefore the most powerful, except for Satan), so that Satan should've looked older than Gabriel, implying he's above Gabriel, since he really is.

Prophecy is entirely different--it achieves both very good and very bad--long stretches of the movie really are outstanding, especially Viggo Mortensen and, of course, Christopher Walken.  But there are other parts which are dreadful, and elements which make absolutely no sense, and the evolution of the story (so to speak) is miserable.  Christopher Walken plays Gabriel with a kind of sinister grace that is perfect for the role, after all this is an angel that resents God for giving humans souls and favoring them over his kind.  Put be plainly, right near the beginning, explicitly rejects Lucifer's route, something along the lines of We don't want to be God, we want it to be like it was.  The way Walken hunches over in places, squatting like a gargoyle on a medieval cathedral is interesting in and of itself.  What the second war in heaven really is all about, and how it is waged, and why God doesn't do anything about it, is left largely unexplained, but they give enough info to make the general plot line entertaining.  Virginia Madsen as a teacher who's student is used as a vehicle for an evil soul, the one that will tip the balance in the war, is the weakest of the cast.  She's not given much to do, and nothing much to say.  The best parts of this movie are such things as when Lucifer explains his position in the whole situation, a reasonably complex one as well.  The worst parts are things like the obvious plot hole that allows Christopher Walken to immediately render humans unconscious or dead just by waving his hand, but then he's not able to do the same to the hero of the movie at certain times--just not very well explained why he's allowing the failed priest/homocide detective get away half what allows.  Some might view the movie as offensive, though I really don't know why; the closest thing to a real attack is when Gabriel says to the cop something like And you were raised Catholic, you should be on MY side.  Apart from that, the essence of the movie comes more one line that comes near the end where the same homocide cop says to Lucifer I have my soul, and my faith, what do you have?  Or when Lucifer expalins that hell is not the presence of burning oil or streams of ice, but rather an absence of God's grace.  Actually some very interesting takes on God and religion. It's just too bad that it's matched with such a botched ending, and such awful hackneyed elements like mystic Indian ceremonies and the forced love interest.

Walken's character of Gabriel has the qualities of true evil but at the same time a deep love for God.  The movie in essence deals with a war going on in heaven between angels loyal to God and those who felt they have become second choice to man.  Stolz plays an angel who is trying to give man one last chance to survive, all the while Walken's Gabriel is on his tail.  Koteas delivers a powerful role as a priest who has lost his faith but perhaps has found salvation in being a cop.  All in all I highly recommend this title as it shows a darker and insightful side to what heaven and angels may be like.

I really loved the story, and some of the imagery provided to back it up like the field of angels on spikes....awesome imagery. The actual film though was just poor, i can't find any reason for the main character - the priest-cum-cop being in there at all. The lead female also...no reason to be there, the main characters dialogue was just empty, it had no substance, the story could have been told well without them. Now, some sterling performances did feature, Walken, Stoltz and Mortensen pulled off some wingers, though their scenes were mostly with the lifeless leads.One other thing i am not getting from this film is why it features native American rituals to purge the dark soul. The child that carries it is clearly of native American origin but apart from the end scenario there is nothing that connects here with that heritage. The plot concerning the dark soul itself it barely told, odd considering that the dark soul is the driver for the whole premise of the film. The back story of its original owner (the colonel) is briefly touched but not enough to allow understanding as to why its his soul that is the special one.I cannot find a justification for the scrolling scenery shots in this film either, several of the plains around 'chimney rock'. I get the feeling they had a helicopter and wanted to make the most of it as none of the shots have any relevance, nor are they in keeping with the mood -> Horror. The film falls into the sci-fi category more than it does horror. There was no real shock or scare scenes, some mild gore and blood but no fear element.So, aside from 3 roles played damn well this film is a big ole' dud.

One scene during which the clouds open and 3 or 4 angels fly overhead is particularly accurate.  The wingspan needed for them is about 20 feet per wing, thats a total wingspan of 40 feet, the film came close with about 17 feet on either side, closest I have ever seen. (20 feet based on smallish human with lightweight bones and wings)  Also the powers that the angels had are strickingly close to those they possess in the bible, which seems to give the movie more truth and meaning.  eg. the spontaneous combustion of the dead angel in the morgue by Gabriel (christopher walken), or the raising of the dead, again gabriel.  My favorite one though is the containment of a soul within himself by Simon, though passing it presents the problem of having to kiss the recipient of the soul, also as shwon with this movie, if the soul happens to be particularly evil or good, it can have side effects upon the container, namely Simon.My favorite character over all is Lucifer (Viggo Mortensen).

Here's a list...- Film is too short - All the actors have American accents prompting the question, 'Are Angels American?' - Elias Koteas is too wooden in this role - Amanda Plummer is underused - What is the point of Adam Goldberg's character? - Viggo Mortensen in one of his worst roles - Virginia Madsen doesn't deliver the goods in her post-'Candyman' role - Christopher Walken is more comic-book scary than 'I am the Angel of Death, behold my flaming sword which destroys nations'-scary - The character study of Col. Hawthorne doesn't have much depth - The death of Uziel, why would a car be driving 70mph+, without stopping, down a dead-end alleyway? - Why would the Sioux Indians play a part in the exorcism of Mary's evil spirit when the spirit itself isn't of Sioux origin? - The relationship between Simon and Mary, and the questions about their relationship, aren't very realistic - The dialogue and exposition is some of the worst I've ever seen, lots of plot holes, essentially - The score plays a much too prominent role - The film clearly takes its premise from 'The Paradise Lost' by John Milton yet never makes reference of this - It was made into a franchiseApart from these problems, the film itself isn't that bad and the idea of the film is quite good and original. Not many films draw attention to the idea that was set about in 'The Paradise Lost', about how the Christian God cast out the angels because they were jealous of his devotion to the creation of mankind. As I mentioned, one of the problems with this film is that it never says in the titles or in the credits that it was an interpretation of John Milton's literary masterpiece yet it is clear that the film takes influence from it. Without 'The Paradise Lost', this film wouldn't exist, and I think the filmmakers are in the wrong for not making light of this. The visuals are quite good and the matte paintings are beautiful, the production and sound is also quite good, and some of the sequences (the dying angels particularly) are hauntingly astonishing. A sequence that sticks out in my mind is the death of the angel Uziel, and the following set-piece (an autopsy), something which is truly horrific, though this itself is not without film-making error. I am quite harsh on Viggo Mortensen by saying this is one of his worst roles - his role as Lucifer is actually quite good but not without fault. As with Christopher Walken's character, Viggo plays Lucifer in a more comic-book villain way as opposed to a deeply horrendous and truly scary way, something which you would expect of such a noteworthy villain. My interpretation of Satan would be cold, he would be calculated and he would be meticulous, he wouldn't be pro-active, he wouldn't be running around like a maniac, his words would do far more damage than his physical actions, which is why half of his performance is quite good, particularly the 'introduction of Lucifer' sequence where he says 'I can lay you out and fill your mouth with your mother's faeces or we can talk' to Virginia Madsen who plays Catherine. Obviously, given such a script, Viggo has little to work with so it's not entirely his fault.The film also features Eric Stoltz in one of his better performances, slightly more subdued than what you'd usually see him as (take 'Pulp Fiction' or 'Killing Zoe' for example), playing the good angel Simon. The role also required Eric to kiss passionately both a grown man and a small, female child, something which you wouldn't see Tom Cruise or any other A-list mega-star doing in the future, but don't let these two things shroud the other noteworthy performances that Eric makes in this film.The main problem with this film, I find, is the character study of Col. Hawthorne. What we learn about Hawthorne is that he was a Colonel during the Korean War and that he was responsible for various inhumane acts of cruelty against the Koreans in the town of Chozin, but we never go into depth with this. We also learn that the same spirit that possessed Hawthorne has been transported via Simon into Mary, but we never learn that much about the spirit. What would have made this film all the more interesting is if we'd have had a full analysis of Hawthorne's presence and the significance he plays in the war between the rogue angels and the humans. After all, we see in Thomas' dream Hawthorne standing behind Mary, why? This is never really explained and the story leaves a very large plot-hole that goes unsolved.But anyway, overall I'd say this film is not bad and it's worth watching if you have and hour and thirty minutes to spare.5 out of 10 "},{"Title":"Thin line","Date":"21 November 2001","Score":"8 out of 18 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Fantasy, Horror","Review":"  There is a thin line between exploring new fields, and simple trash.

But when you get to the end, you feel like you've only been watching for about half that time. Just when it looks like the movie is gonna get epic, you realize that it's all over, and that The Prophecy has never truly gotten of the ground.This motion picture is disappointing not because it is silly (which it is) but because it has nothing to offer. It has no story to work with and no resources to provide flair or presentation, which would have been nice. Anything which concerns a war with god, probably sounds epic as an elevator pitch, but the question is how well can it translate to the screen. This production is striped to the bone of any possible adventure, thrill, spectacle, and credibility. It has taken me a while to consider it, but is anybody else bothered by the fact that angels or demons take on human form at times when it is unnecessary? By staying in human form, the angel Gabriel (who is evil in this movie) is far more vulnerable to the possibility of having his butt kicked than if he sprouted wings. His power is restricted to death by touch, (or life). It reads well but it doesn't look well. As another example, watching Elias Kortea confront Lucifer is no more intimidating than standing face to face with a mullet head dressed in black. The only part of the Prophecy which stands out is Christopher Walken. With his line delivery, he brings a dose of satire to the movie. Perhaps this was the director's intention, but then again, a byproduct of Christopher Walken is that the guy comes programmed with an inability to take anything seriously. If satire WAS the director's original intention, it would certainly explain the attempt to have the Lucifer character be equally self-mocking. Unfortunately, Viggo Mortensen, mistakes overacting for humour. It feels unnatural and ineffective. When all is said and done, The Prophecy, though not impossible to watch, is pretty much a waste of time. It needs a greater depth and scope, and stronger climax, more adrenaline, and a larger brain.

The only clue on his body is an ancient handwritten bible which leads Daggett to a small US town in search of the grave of a Korean war Colonel accused of human sacrifice & into a battle between warring Angels some of whom feel resentment towards the human race because of God's affection for them & one in particular, Gabriel (Christopher Walken), wants to steal the Colonel's soul in order to destroy the human race (not sure how) but it has been transfered into schoolgirl Mary (Moriah Shining Dove Snyder) & Daggett sets out to protect her from Gabriel & hopefully save the human race from total destruction. All in a days work I suppose.Written & directed by Gregory Widen this very religious themed supernatural horror flick is an OK way to pass the time I suppose but I have to say apart from the always watchable Christopher Walken & some nice cinematography I didn't think that much of it overall. Personally I think the biggest problem I had with The Prophecy was that it spends far too much time on obscure religious themes & ideas which never really pay-off, it tries to take conventional ideas & accepted belief's & twist them around a bit by actually making Angels evil rather than the whiter than white portrayals seen elsewhere but to my eyes Gabriel just looked like an ordinary guy & therefore this distinction was somewhat lost on me & not being religious in the slightest also didn't help me get the most of The Prophecy. There one or two decent sequences & the initial detective mystery thriller vibe going on as Daggett investigates the murder is quite cool but once it switches to the small town setting things just play out in rather standard horror fantasy film fashion. I am not saying The Prophecy is a bad film or that it's not worth watching but I just thought it got bogged down in a lot of unconvincing religious nonsense that I personally found a bit dull. The character's are alright, while the Angels are given all sorts of silly sounding dialogue to have fun with the two main leads are actually a bit flat & don't have much personality.I must say that the photography for The Prophecy is rather nice with some nicely lit & tinted scenes, this certainly has a little bit of style about it. There's not much in the way of gore, there's some blood splatter, people are seen impaled on spikes during a flashback, there's a dead mutilated body seen on an autopsy table & a ripped out heart at the end. The Prophecy takes itself extremely seriously & the tone is very bleak.With a supposed budget of about $8,000,000 this actually had a lot of money spent on it & while it did make it's money back at the box-office it was not a major hit although it has spawned quite a few direct-to-video/DVD sequels. Filmed in Arizona. There's a good cast here including Christopher Walken who is always very intense, Virginia Madsen, Viggo Mortensen & Amanda Plummer. Oh, & Eric Stoltz is also in it.The Prophecy is an OK supernatural horror fantasy thriller with heavy religious overtones that I thought was alright but not much more.

And director Gregory Widen must have really counted his blessings when he learned that all those fine actors agreed to appear in this movie, since he himself obviously is not the most talented director around.So the movie gets only mainly purely uplifted by its actors. I just can't believe how many fine actors there are in this movie. This is of course one big fun role from Christoper Walken, who plays the fallen angel Gabriel.

The movie is full of nonsensical setups like this. Gregory Widen has a Citizen Kane attitude, and a Plan 9 from Outer Space ability.

How could anybody possibly take this crap seriously? Whether you're a Christian or an atheist, this film has something to offend everybody.The only thing that saves this is Christopher Walken putting in perhaps his best performance ever. That's where the two extra stars came from.I was also attracted by a few more of my favourites; Amanda Plummer and Viggo Mortensen, but alas, they didn't have enough screen time to do them justice.Anyway, this isn't horror, it's not suspenseful, it's not frightening, but it is funny, the scenes with Walken in them, that is.

Christopher Walken is great in the role of the Angel Gabriel. However, what spoilt it for me was that the film concentrated too much on Christianity. Constant reference to Church, Jesus and the Bible meant that unless you happen to follow this faith, you will not get much satisfaction out of this.

It didn't make any sense either. I didn't understand why all the angels were jealous or if that guy at the end was an angel or demon. I didn't understand why an angel from god would want an evil soul. I didn't understand why there would be war in heaven when heaven is suppose to be a place of goodness and love. I didn't understand any of this movie at all. Plus, it was a very boring and slow moving movie but the actors and actresses didn't do a horrible job of acting. It was a boring, dull movie that I just didn't understand.

I'm sorry, but I was disappointed, despite the excellent performances by Eric Stoltz and Christopher Walken, and the superior one by Viggo Mortenson.The unfocused script is all over the map. What I believe would have been better is for the ancient Bible to contain an ALTERNATE version of Revelation, in which Satan, not God won. But no, we get an errant Angel Gabriel (Christopher Walken) running all over the map looking for a soul. Some of these scenes are darkly funny, and Walken is a hoot, but they don't do a lot for suspense or clarity. Where the heck is Michael, the arkangel? Mortenson as Lucifer is mesmerizing. But, wouldn't the movie have been a lot more interesting if Michael were searching for a child WHO WOULD BECOME the greatest murderer of all time, and the ex-priest faced the dilemma of killing the child to save mankind or not committing the mortal sin of murder. Now, THAT would have been interesting.Sorry, a couple of fine performances just can't save The Prophecy. I give it a 5.

The premise is interesting, but they failed to follow through.  There is some nifty camera work, but they should have spent less time on that and more time on the script and editing. The story is disjointed, and doesn't make sense in a few places.  The dialogue ranges from silly to stupid.  The acting is uninspired (except for Walken, who is the ONLY good thing about this film).  The biggest problem the film has is that it is INCREDIBLY BORING!  And it is supposed to be a horror film!  Only watch this film if you want insight into how a good premise can result in a horrible film.

The acting is stilted and the dialogue is complete tripe. I tend to have a thing for these kinds of movies but I can't really say anything gracious about this movie. There have been some great concepts and ideas with respect to the legends and myths of the war in heaven. It's just a shame none of them managed to make it into this movie. I know that it was 1995 and Viggo and Christopher Walken have done some great work before and since and I'm clinging to the hope they they lost a bet and had to star in this thing as a community service or some other form of penance.

Well, with movies one often has to suspend disbelief, but this one is different you have to adopt a complete set of belief angels, lucifer, heaven and all that stuff. In other words a perfect catholic movie, all approved I'm sure by the highest religious authorities. That could still be okay if the movie was interesting, but the short scenes of weird action are separated by long boring moments, with religious gospels or bible reading sessions.No the part that I really disliked is the politically correct 'Oh, but we know there are other religions on Earth, see we put some indians... Indians that we only see do useless handwaving, just to show how terribly inefficient they are compared to a great religion that has angels fighting each others in your backyards...I don't believe you need to see that movie...

The writing is poor with the characters motivations making no real sense.The main human characters have no personality, this is a bit of a problem since we should empathise with them but the feeble attempt at a back-story offers nothing of interest and its hard to care about them.Walken is clearly enjoying himself as the bad angel but, although he at least has some motivation, his actions don't always make sense and his powers are poorly defined. The character of Lucifer who is brought in seems is the weakest of the lot, his motivation makes no sense, his dialogue is dreadful and he is clearly just thrown in to plug a big plot hole.A very disappointing effort, not worth watching.

But how many people lose their faith because Heaven showed them too much? Daggett nearly became a priest; now he's a cop. He may want to put religion behind him, but one morning a weird, eyeless, hermaphroditic corpse turns up. Suddenly he is on a path that will put him right in the middle of a war in Heaven. And once again, Heaven will show him too much gore, blood, charred flesh, living corpses and much worse. Even more central to the heavenly war effort is a young girl. This American Indian child has something Gabriel (Christopher Walken) wants. And Gabriel is willing to kill her and anyone in his path&#x97;or even reanimate a corpse or two&#x97;to get it.The Prophecy is disgusting, sloppy, confusing, pretentious, ridiculous and&#x97;when it tries to be funny&#x97;unfunny. And then Viggo Mortensen shows up as a self-satisfied, singing Satan with coprophilia on his mind. Does it get worse? Probably. The movie has several sequels. "}]
