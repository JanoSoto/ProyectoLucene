That should probably give you a fair idea of what this movie is like, though it does feature less Corey Feldman water-skiing than expected. Somewhat surprisingly there are some jokes in here that work (the bible vending machine ruled), but overall this just really feels like everyone's trying way, way too hard. Especially the visual gags have that bothersome laugh, damn it! feel to them, they're so close to Naked Gun but just not quite. Same goes for the obligatory breakings of the fourth wall, not bad but not really focused enough to generate big laughs. Nielsen's talents are rather wasted here, though I must say he is about the only element that made me keep watching. It's also a very nice touch that Linda Blair agreed to do this movie, even though I have absolutely no idea why she did. Not because of the solid screenplay, I'm pretty sure of that. This is in all ways a sub-par spoof, but I reckon it's still watchable for avid Nielsen fans.

For better or for worse, though, someone else thought differently, and in 1990, a spoof-flick was made in it's honor.Perhaps being delivered 17 years too late, Repossessed earns its credibility in the casting of Linda Blair (of The Exorcist and its sequel) and the reliable Leslie Nielsen. Unfortunately, the humor -- which is not surprisingly derivative of Airplane! and The Naked Gun -- falls flat with many dated jokes peppered amongst cornball sight-gags and tired slapstick humor. Granted, if that's your sort of thing, you'll have a good time, especially if you're familiar with the source material. Ned Beatty (who also had a role in The Exorcist II) has perhaps the most entertaining part as a straight-up send-up of televangelist Jim Bakker. Just one of the many jokes within, though, that you won't understand if you don't remember it.As a movie that doesn't require too much mental investment, it's a pretty painless experience (minus the grating pop/theme song) if you can forgive its flaws and lack of gigantic laughs.

A spoof of THE EXORCIST with Linda Blair returning and Nelson coming off THE NAKED GUN should have meant a sure-fire hit but sadly this is a rather boring, unfunny and at times painfully bad movie that probably had more cash in its eye than anything else. There's so much that could have been done with the material but this is a perfect example of why certain films work and why others don't. Stuff like AIRPLANE, HOT SHOTS and THE NAKED GUN work because of the talented screenwriters who make the jokes work. Writer-director Bob Logan simply doesn't get the material to work for a number of reasons but the biggest is that the jokes are all rather lame and just seem forced. One such example of Blair fixing her kids pea soup. Another has a priest saying something about head and it of course being taken the wrong way. The stuff with the preacher and his wife is so forced and annoying that it just never gets any laughs. Even worse is how the story structure is because for the most part we see Nelson teaching in front of a class and then we see the other story dealing with Blair. We go back and forth between the two and usually we get Nelson making a few comments but those two are unfunny. Nelson seems bored in his part and Beatty simply overplays his. Blair doesn't give a very good performance but I'm not going to blame her since the material just wasn't right and she appears to really be forcing herself to try and get laughs. REPOSSESSED should have worked and probably could have worked in better hands but as it is the movie is just cheap and weak.

But a long time ago, Nancy was possessed by the devil and she was exorcised by a kind priest Father Jebedaiah Mayii (Leslie Nielsen). Now after all these years, when Nancy lived the good life... then suddenly she's repossessed again after 17 years ago, when she's watching TV with her family. Now the possessed Nancy wants Father Mayii to battle with him again and to see, if Father Mayii still got what it takes to remove the demon out of her. Since Father Mayii is too old to fight this demon again, he's getting help from a young inexperience priest Father Luke Brophy (Anthony Starke). But when Father Brophy tells the Church there's a possessed woman, the Church thinks it would be best if it's televised with the association of a sleazy televangelist (Ned Beatty) and his wife (Lana Schwab) hoping to get millions from the ratings and of course... donations to the Chruch and stealing money from the donations by the televangelist by making himself richer. But the situation goes way out of control on live TV and the possessed demon is hoping to get people possessed by other demons for those who watched the TV special. Now Father Mayii and Father Brophy are forced to fight with this demon, before it's gets away by controlling the world.Written and Directed by Bob Logan (Meatballs 4, Up Your Alley) made an not so successful spoof to the classic horror movies of all time The Exorcist with Blair making fun of her own Oscar-Nominated role. The problem with the film, while it is watchable. While the directing and the script by the director isn't always successful. There's some terrible acting at times and some unsuccessful gags are supposed to hit the mark. Which Logan is certainly not the right writer or director to make this kind of spoof. But Logan does tries hard for it and he goes some points for it. But it's Blair, Nielsen and Starke makes its somewhat enjoyable if forgettable movie fun to watch and they give their 110 %. Blair still certainly looks great with that demonic possession look and it looks almost as good but different than the original Make-Up look that it was design by Oscar-WinnerDick Smith. Repossessed is certainly a curiosity movie, nothing more with good comedic performances by the leads, some good visual gags and amusing cameos.

Ironically enough, the funniest aspects about Repossessed are the trivia details behind it. Apparently the initial screening tests didn't fail just once, but twice! At first the script contained almost exclusively jokes and typical situations referring to the 1973 horror landmark The Exorcist but, being released no less than 17 years overdue, a large part of the target audience was too young to already have seen that film and hence didn't comprehend the humor. Subsequently, entire parts of the script got replaced with more general and contemporary 80's comedy (for example an extended sequence set inside a fitness center with guru Jake Steinfeld) in order to appeal more to younger viewers, but it still failed because &#133; well, the movie simply isn't funny! Writer/director Bob Logan's only remotely praiseworthy accomplishment was that he (or at least his producers) managed to trap Linda Blair into playing a mocking version of the one role that made her world famous. But even that you have to put into perspective, as Blair was probably so tired of getting typecast that she considered a comical part her last resort to get rid of her 'that-Exorcist-girl' reputation. Leslie Nielsen, with his almost naturally comical charisma, narrates the events of Repossessed in front of a class of college students. The films opens with a flashback of Nancy's first exorcism in 1973, but then jumps forward 17 years in time, when she's a married woman with two annoying brat-children. Via the TV-set, the devil takes possession of her body and yet again she spurts gooey green stuff all over her beloved ones. Father Mayii is reluctant to perform another exorcism because of his heart condition, so Nancy relies on the inexperienced young priest Father Brophy and a couple of power-hungry Televangelists that don't even believe in demonic possession. There aren't any truly laugh-out-loud moments in Repossessed at all. If you're lucky, you might briefly chuckle once or twice but the majority of jokes are just plain embarrassing. There are numerous lame literal jokes and uninspired puns that'll make you roll your eyes in disbelief. For example, one character says The word on the street says that your career is history&#133; and at the same moment the camera actually shows a piece of street with the words your career is history painted on it. Lame! The finale is pitiable and seems to go on forever, especially when the entire cast starts imitating the greatest rock stars of the eighties. Remember the intro of Scary Movie 2 (which simultaneously is the only worthwhile sequence in the whole film) where James Woods does a wacky 10 minutes re-enactment of The Exorcist? Well, it might be crude and vulgar, but that scene is much funnier and more effective as this dud.

I'm probably going to be in the minority on this but I personally think this is another under the radar gem. This film believe it or not was one of the first parody films I've seen and it was also the first film with Lesile Nelson I've seen before the Naked Gun films.This to me is one of those parodies done right because it really feels like it's doing it's own thing which is what a good working parody should do. And yeah sure it's not on the same level as the Naked Gun films (first and second to be precise) or any other A level parody film out there but it's not trying to be, it's just trying to be plain fun.This film is an obvious jab to The Exercist and I think it's a very solid hit that leaves a mark. Not much I can really say about this film, I really like some of the physical sight gags which really made me chuckle like one really suttle one was seeing a bible vending machine which I don't think is too far off with the vending machines we have now where some sell random jewelry and romance novels. But of course there was that rocky like montage sequence, where we see Mayii train and gear up for the exorcism which I thought was funny and cool since I'm a fan of the Rocky films and I even like the lunch box that Mayii brings, I'll give you a hint it's another Stalone action film. That's one of the best things about the film it kinda homages Stalone's films a lot, the writer must've been a Stalone fan.Even some of the verbal gags are funny like the jabs on PMS, you got to admit whenever the female populace goes though it, they do act like their possessed. Or my favorite line Freeze puke face! The characters are really solid and a lot of fun. I really like subordinate villain Ernest Weller played by Ned Beatty whom is pretty much just a sleaze con artist that is cheating viewers out of their money with his church program and of course the devil possession situation is just another opportunity for money and ratings. It's obviously a parody on some of the TV church scams that were going on .But of course the main villain the Devil is the spotlight villain, played well by Linda Blair which is ironic since she was in The Exercist. What really makes this version stand out for me is the scheme The Devil has which is to influence and create more followers by using the power of media. That's another thing the film does is it parodies on the issue of media manipulation.And the protagonists are also great. Anthony Stark as Father Luke is funny because he's good natured and always means to help but is always insecure, he's got some good lines.But the highlight of course of the whole film is Lesile Nielsen whom plays Father Mayii. I like his last name which is obviously two words run together. Not much to say for his character, Lesile as usual plays it straight as a good natured priest whom has became retired and reluctant due to the post trauma he's suffered from the last exorcism he's done. Which of course all the more wants you to win, hoping he'll find the courage and strength again. But other than that his character is hilarious he's got some great lines even some sight gags as well. Like seeing him watch a telethon of Weller's crooked Chirch program and he is expressing constant distaste and wearing a bunch of random masks to numb the pain of the program; though Mayii could've just turned to another channel but I guess nothing else was on and he didn't have cable.The exorcism which to me is the real highlight of this film. It was just hilarious just seeing Luke and Mayii just do their jobs while the Devil was just giving them more and more grief. Let alone seeing a cameo by Jesse Ventura and Gene do a wrestling cometary on the exorcism which really added to the humor more because I was a bit of a fan of the WWF at the time (the 80's and early 90's when WWF was actually still good).What all three of them go though in the exorcism is just really random and crazy almost like one big skit show. I won't give away too much two of my favorite moments were seeing the Devil just turn both Mayii into just random things and Luke is going along with it. Or even the Devil with a Blue Dress number which I thought was a lot of fun since I like that song.The only bad things about the film for me are that I do thing the middle of the film is just a bit on the slow side, but of course things pick back up around the third and final half so I can't complain too much. And of course some of the visual jokes as well as a few sight gags are kinda lame but same could be said for a lot of other comedies out there and there are more than enough hits to keep you satisfied.If your a fan of the parody subgenere as well as Lesile Neilson then I recommend giving this film a try, it's devilish fun.Rating 3 stars "},{"Title":"No you may not....","Date":"23 July 2013","Score":"2 out of 4 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Fantasy, Horror","Review":" Nielsen continues his foray into the spoof genre with this parody of the Exorcist and evangelist TV.Linda Blair parodies he role as Regan in the classic horror and plays Nancy (great Joke) in this.

I just saw this movie last night, and I found it to be alternately hilarious and awful.  Mostly awful, but here's my take on what went wrong and what miraculously turned out right.First off, big round of applause to Linda Blair for making such an idiot of herself and not seeming to mind.  She is the highlight of the movie, and it definitely wouldn't work without her.  I have seen several reviews of this film that slam her for being unfunny.  I am willing to bet that it isn't her fault.  This is an infantile movie, and it takes immature people to make those.  Bob Logan, who wrote the film, probably thought that the idea of Linda Blair was enough.  She doesn't tell jokes, she IS the joke.  She doesn't have to do anything amusing, because you automatically contrast then (The Exorcist) and now (this movie)--that's the joke.  Effortless, isn't it?  It is aggravating to see people mourn Linda Blair as a one-trick pony who turns out mindless small variations on her one talent.  I prefer to think of her as one of two ways.  First--a kind person who realized she was the only thing that would redeem this film (if you want to consider it redeemed).  As I said earlier, she holds the movie together.  The other point-of-view is that she is a fairly amusing person who doesn't mind mocking herself.  She does it wonderfully, if that is the case.Parts of this movie are quite funny; at least, they are to me.  One of my favorites is toward the end, during the exorcism.  It is one of those moments where you contrast Regan and Nancy (the new victim).  In the original, Regan had a phenomenally disgusting moment in which she screamed the famous words Lick me while assaulting her mother.  That was a horrifying moment, but Repossessed gives us relief in a ridiculous spoof.  While Leslie Nielsen does his thing, we hear Linda Blair screeching (is that really her, by the by?) Lick me, Lick me and I automatically went on alert.  I really didn't want to see that moment again, frankly.  Fortunately, we are treated to a shot of Linda Blair as an ice cream cone.  Lick me, get it?  She then snarls, Is this cool or what?  It's a relief, pure and simple.  That's how I consider this film.  A breath of fresh, stupid air after the original film knocked the wind out of you.Bad moments--the overly gay bodybuilder and the idiotic and pointless nudity jokes.  There's no need for any of that.

I love this movie as a horror comedy, but it could be better enjoyed by more people seeing it on video than by the jokers at Comedy Central who edited out all the naughty scenes. Heck, those chowder-heads canceled MST3K for crying out loud ! It is weird seeing Linda Blair playing her old role again after all these years or Robert Fuller, the doctor from Emergency! once more, but Leslie Neilsen is loving it as he plays Father Mayii, the clerical Frank Drebin. Anthony Starke plays his role almost deadpan throughout, but Ned Beatty is hilarious as he gets most of the best scenes. The PMS jokes are way overused and the Benny Hill inflatable breasts joke makes a cameo in my favorite scene on an uncredited actress named Sara Matthews. Several of the other roles are forgettable except perhaps for Nancy's clueless husband or Jake Steinfeld the exercise instructor who plays his role as if this was a straight part in the original Exorcist. There are some jokes the film could have done or weren't daring enough to use such as the bra gag in any of Blair's possessed scenes, but was it really necessary to have Gene Okerlund and Jesse Ventura,the future Wisconsin governor, critique the exorcism ? Maybe so,but their comments were a little distracting and the shape-shifting between Mayii and Blair quite a bit tagged on. Still, this movie does have some big laughs, but obviously not enough or this would have been shown theatrically.

Airplane!, The Naked Gun (And its sequels), Pandemonium and Scary Movie are my favorites. Make good parodies is very difficult. Bob Logan's Repossessed is a great example of a good parody. Much people don't give it a chance, but i really think that this is a great comedy, of course with some flaws but and outstanding Linda Blair, and a funny Leslie Nielsen, Repossessed becomes to be one of my favorite comedies and parodies.Repossessed is the funny satire to the original and terrible but excellent The Exorcist (1973), which have too Linda Blair in the same character. But, is necessary that you understand what i try to say first with the plot of the original parodied film. William Peter Blatty's The Exorcist is about a little girl who is possessed by the devil, and how a poor mother and the faith of a young priest its debated in his own believes. The film was one of the most shocking dramatic horror and at the same time spiritual since then. But much of the cast and crew suffer a lot, and Linda Blair, with only 12 years, was one of the most affected. Linda Blair was the famous possessed girl. As i seen in an A& E biography, Linda don't have a calm adolescence. Since then was like a curse for her. Repossessed was like a real salvation, a real exorcism for that course, for that demon who pursuit her since the original film. She want laugh of that suffer, she want laugh of the devil, so she do Repossessed.Bob Logan's Repossessed is perfect. Makes laugh with ironical situations, besides of awesome performances (I love the performance of Anthony Starke). I think that Repossesed is not so simple as much of us think. Of course is silly, but far of that has a lot messages The media and how have control of the audience (Like Network for example), how maybe the believes and religion are not so different, and how we can laugh of the devil and the suffering in this way. Repossessed is silly, of course. But this foolishness had a great meaning.*Sorry for the mistakes... well, if there any.

So Father Brophy tries to get Father Mayii out of retirement to help him perform Nancy's exorcism and also it's going to be played on live TV to boost ratings for some has-beens.This a reasonably okay spoof on 'The Exorcist' that has it fair share of hits and misses, led by Leslie Nielsen as the head priest and the one who is telling the story about the repossession to a class of students. The film itself isn't great as a whole, as you got a couple good scenes and one-liners that standout from the rest- but you got a couple scenes and lines that are incredibly in bad taste or just lame.One thing I noticed that some gag's were borrowed in the opening sequence of the awfully bad Scary Movie 2, with the 'The Exorcist' part being the only amusing thing about that movie.The story itself is weak and really of no importance, as it's the gags that are the main attraction, with one gag or joke after another- though some of the gags start getting really tiresome and repetitive halfway through the film. So because of the one-idea film, it drags towards the end, making it feel longer than its 80mins-running time.The performances are nothing special, Leslie Nielsen has most of the funny parts as the retired Father Jebedaiah Mayii who makes a comeback to face his old demons (in many amusing ways) and also Ned Betty as Ernest Weller has his comical moments as the TV host. Linda Blair reprises her role that made her big- but this time mocking her performance in 'The Exorcist', as the possessed women named Nancy Aglet, while she was quite funny at first especially with the hilarious scenes involving her family- but after a while it got kind of stale and Anthony Starke plays the young unexperienced Father Luke Brophy, who is basically wooden and is pretty light of the laughs.This is worth a look if you want to see a stupid mockery of a classic film- but still it's quite forgettable and if you want a good comedy in the same vein with Leslie Nielsen watch the Naked Gun films instead.2/5 "},{"Title":"The Devil made her do it...again!","Date":"22 May 2001","Score":"1 out of 3 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Fantasy, Horror","Review":"  My opinion of Repossessed is extremely biased.

The movie is a parody of the original The Exorcist with Linda Blair basically rehashing her role, this time being possessed by Satan as a 30-something housewife. Of course it is up to an old priest (Leslie Nielsen) and a young one with faith issues (Anthony Starke) to try and save Blair one more time. Along for the ride are television evangelists Ned Beatty and Lana Schwab (Jim and Tammy Fay Baker clones) who believe that they can save Blair by exorcising her in front of a national television audience (just caring about money and never believing she is really possessed in the first place). The devil in Blair is not the easiest entity to defeat though. Another Leslie Nielsen under-achiever as he takes the spotlight away from Blair and Beatty (who both actually starred together in The Exorcist II The Heretic back in 1977) with tired and down-right silly results.

Out of the blue as a young kid, she landed a part in one of the most shocking films of its time that really redefined the modern horror film. In 1973, hardly anyone had ever heard of exorcism and then it was on the cover of Newsweek. Maybe there have been more bloody and graphic horror films, but none that so grabbed people at the time. People fainting and getting sick in the theater was a common occurrence. The cruel fact is that this film was both a blessing and a curse for Linda Blair. Amazingly other then Airport 1975 and the TV films Born Innocent and Sarah T...Portrait Of A Teenage Alcoholic, Blair was never really offered another decent part in a film that would become someone who had been nominated for an Oscar in their first major role (for you trivia lovers she lost to another child actress Tatum O'Neil). Blair is a fine actress who can bring style and class to even the most mundane role. Wasn't it great when she was a hit on stage with Grease a few years back? Seventeen years later, she made this film with Leslie Nielsen spoofing The Exorcist (by the way Exorcist III was released the same year). Making this film must have been like therapy for Linda, she was able to spoof her most famous role that was a blessing and a curse for her. Besides, she must have had a ball working with Leslie Nielsen. This is one of those films that you really have to watch closely to catch all the gags. Nothing is sacred, everything from the Pope to Oliver North. They also spoof so many scenes from The Exorcist from the pea soup vomiting to her....well doing that thing with the cross. I also liked the way this film pokes fun at TV evangelists like the one Ned Beatty plays. I even noticed that Robert Fuller, Doctor Kelly Brackett from Emergency, has a part in this. Linda gets some really funny lines and have fun spoofing herself. She must be a great lady and a really good sport.

A straight up parody of the 1973 world changing Horror classic, 'Repossessed' is a fun and often funny romp.Pros Great cast, fun performances. Bouncy score and some decent tunes for the soundtrack. Some clever ideas, like televising the exorcism. Some pretty good special effects. A lot of really funny sight gags and jokes. Plus, a few brilliant parodies of iconic scenes from 'The Exorcist.' Fast paced.Cons Some gags fall flat. Has not aged well. The finale is fun, but perhaps too silly for it's own good.Final thoughts Not a big hit when it was released, but has gained a small following over the years. There are better parody movies, but there are far worse ones as well. It's cool to see Linda Blair poke fun at the role that made her famous. She needed to make peace with it and boy does she sink her teeth into this. Too bad they didn't do a sequel to parody 'The Heretic.' Just imagine the possibilities with that one.My rating 3.5/5 "},{"Title":"funny leslie nielsen vehicle","Date":"29 March 2010","Score":"0 out of 3 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Fantasy, Horror","Review":" if your a leslie nielsen fan and enjoyed airplane and the naked gun, then you will enjoy repossessed, a spoof version of the exorcist, and while it isn't the best in the genre, and leslie nielsen does have funnier movies out there, repossessed is an enjoyable enough comedy that delivers some great laughs as leslie nielsen's priest does battle with the devil. the comedy is very broad and low brow but trust me when your in the mood for it, this is a winner, all in all another funny comedy in the lelsie nielsen cannon, sure its not naked gun or airplane hilereous, it is much funnier than mr.magoo and santa who, leslie nieslen is great in this, watch it "},{"Title":"repo woman","Date":"24 April 2007","Score":"0 out of 3 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Fantasy, Horror","Review":" OK, so we all know that Leslie Nielsen stars in the silliest parodies. It seemed inevitable that he would eventually star in an Exorcist spoof. What makes Repossessed especially eye-opening is that it's got Linda Blair spoofing her own famous role. So, as they just want to be as goofy as possible, much of the humor revolves around projectile vomiting (you'd better have a strong stomach for this one). Aside from that, they poke fun at what were then current events, namely with Ned Beatty as a Jim Bakker-resembling clergyman; there's also Oliver North having a memory problem, Sean Penn having a short temper, and a little something about Morton Downey. Oh, and of course they admit that they're in a movie at one point.Yes, it's basically low humor, but they're not afraid to do whatever they want. You gotta love this one. And the next time that someone asks May I?, you know what to say.

I loved this movie so much that I had to buy it when I found it in a discount bin at Blockbuster. I think I wore out the freeze frame on my VCR when in the exercise machine the girl's breasts start getting bigger ala the Benny Hill balloon bra. The actress is credited as Charlotte Helmkamp,but now I hear it is actually Jennifer Runyon. I also have to assume that this was a stunt that someone wanted to do with Linda Blair when her character became possessed demon's voice I need some more room in here........aaaaaah,that's better.,but she wouldn't go for it,so they stuck it in the aerobics studio.Leslie Neilsen stars in this his umpteenth parody and is joined by several faces,  both recognized and not.Some of the jokes are hilarious, some fizzle out and they miss the chance to do others.I recommend this movie to anyone who loves parodies,but I would warn them not to get their hopes up.

Though not a Zucker brothers production, it IS done in their style, even featuring Leslie Nielsen as the parody Exorcist. But in my opinion, the FUNNIEST moment occurs in the first five minutes. As the credits will readily show, Linda Blair is playing a middle-aged housewife, who is called by name as her neighbor enters, Hi Nancy! This hilarious moment appears to have amused ONLY ME. No one seems to remember that the 12-yr-old in the Exorcist was named Reagan. Often EVEN after I tell someone those facts, I'm still met with a blank, deer-in-the-headlights stare. I then have to resort to beating them over the head with it; open left hand - Nancy, open right hand - Reagan. Nancy Reagan. Duh!

Both Linda Blair and Leslie Nielson are at their comedic best. The premise could have used a little work, but the movie seems to serve one purpose and one purpose only to spoof THE EXCORCIST. I like that idea since I didn't like THE EXCORCIST that much and the movie spoofs it very well yet there needs to be more to the movie. It would have worked better if the movie spoofed several movies and not just a few. Though as I said before, it is a very funny movie with the two leads giving their best performances. The music and special effects are also top-rate along with the writing. I hope that there is a REPOSSESSED 2 sometime soon.

A lot of people were conned in the 1990s by companies tricking people into thinking they`d be watching something similar to THE NAKED GUN by casting Leslie Nielson and releasing the video cover as something similar in style to THE NAKED GUN releases . DRACULA DEAD AND LOVING IT and REPOSSESSED both did this but don`t be fooled because very few if any of the production team who worked on the classic comedy trilogy worked on this movie or the awful DEAD AND LOVING IT REPOSSESSED is a very hit and miss film with little in the way of memorable gags . The jokes that do work best are the groan inducing ones similar to what you`d find in THE NAKED GUN , jokes like  Young lady pull your dress down  and  Are you getting off ?  . Mind you I will give this film credit for being funnier than SCARY MOVIE 2 but neither movie is as funny as THE EXORCIST   "}]
