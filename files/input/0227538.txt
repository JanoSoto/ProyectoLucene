The kids are alright, except the girl is a little bossy, and the villains aren't too nasty. This also looks very good on DVD.Included in the color and characters are the thumb people who were especially fun to watch.The only problem I found with it is the last 30 minutes in which it got too silly and emphasized (typical Hollywood) how the kids can do the job better than the adults, which a ludicrous film clich√©. However, overall family unity gets a big boost in this here, even in the end, and that good message is probably a big reason this movie was such a success.

As entertaining as 'Desperado', 'The Faculty' and 'From Dusk Till dawn' are, you wouldn't line them up alongside 'Toy Story 2' and 'The Jungle Book' for good, old-fashioned family entertainment. Yet, as this energetic, light-hearted Bondesque spoof proves, Rodriguez has the talent to turn his hand to just about anything, and inject it with the suspense and adrenalin that are his trademark.From the gloriously OTT opening scene (which tells the story of how two agents sent to kill each other fall in love and settle down) to the last second, 'Spy Kids' doesn't miss a trick. The obligatory gizmos, mad villains and dastardly plot to take over the world are all there, along with a star cast all playing their roles with tongues firmly in cheek. The action/humour mix is extremely well-balanced too, with some hilarious visual gags sitting within a sharp script and Banderas, in particular, revels taking a sly swipe at his normal 'strong yet silent Latino' image. Yet, refreshingly for a children's film, it's never patronising, never obvious, and genuinely original in places (soldiers made of thumbs, secret agents transformed into tellytubby-type TV characters - imagine Goldeneye-meets-Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory-meets-Any Tim Burton film and you'll be close). In truth, some of the surreal moments and the more graphic effects may get a little too much for younger kids at times, but these moments are few and far between. Ok, it's a 'U' certificate and you may well have to sit through the trailer for 'See Spot Run', but don't let that put you off. This is one of the better films you'll see this year, and the best out over Easter by quite a way. Go and have some fun.8/10  "},{"Title":"Fun for kids and their parents, good for a family movie. *** (out of four)","Date":"10 April 2001","Score":"22 out of 30 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Adventure, Comedy","Review":"  SPY KIDS / (2001) *** (out of four)By Blake French	If James Bond married another secret agent, had kids, privately continued his life as a spy, became captured, and left his rescuing to his offspring, we would have the formula for Robert Rodriguez's new action adventure, Spy Kids. Rodriguez normally directs harsher, more brutal movies, like Desperado and The Faculty, but accustoms a slick style of adventure and humor in this film that exceeds past the level of any of his recent work.  Spy Kids really does belong in some kind of James Bond picture.	As the film's writer, director, and co producer, Rodriguez does a lot more with the material here than we expect. The film has a stunning array of special effects, ranging from walking thumbs to a particularly imaginative experience in the villain's headquarters. Even the introduction has zest and intrigue we meet a seemingly normal family of four, consisting of Ingrid and Gregorio Cortez (Alexa Vega and Antonio Banderas), and their children, probably middle school aged, Juni and Carmen (Daryl Sabara and Alexa Vega). As the movie opens, Ingrid tells her children a nice bedtime story about two daring spies assigned to kill the other, but fall in love, get married, and retire. She prepares her offspring for bed and turns the lights off, walks to her husband, and explains she thinks it would be a good idea to tell Carmen and Juni their real identities as top-secret spies; the story Ingrid enlightened her kids with was true.	 Rodriguez quickly sketched his characters, but his method is surprisingly effective; the movie starts out with fast-paced action and captures our attention abruptly and does not really lose energy throughout its running time. We learn the two married spies have retired from the business nine years prior, but their fellow OSS agents are disappearing all over the world, and thinks it to be the work of a kids TV show host named Fegan Floop (Alan Cumming in a very whimsical, fitting performance) and his assistant, Minion (Tony Shalhoub). The agents have been converted into clay-like animated characters held captive at his mega tech laboratory.  Imaginative and interesting, if a bit cheesy. 	Ingrid and Gregorio call their Uncle Felix over to watch the kids while they go out on their latest mission. Unfortunately, this mission could be their last; they walk right into a trap and are snared from beneath their toes. Felix receives a distress call, sends the kids to a safe house, but is captured himself, leaving the responsibilities to the younger members of the family. 	The story isn't cheap or silly, although some of the material tests our tolerance for far-fetched science fiction. The underlying motives here are also legitimate. The movie puts confidence in strong family values, honesty, and trust, but does not preach, lecture, or on the other side of the barrel, become lost in an utter mess of silly dog poop and passing gas jokes like See Spot Run. The movie takes itself seriously, and is well written. We understand the character's motives.    	Spy Kids gets one thing painfully right, and that is therelationship of the brother and sister. Their relationship is all too familiar in American households, where name calling and mean-spirited behavior inhabit offspring of both sexes. The petty little conflicts they feel strained and forced, giving this movie, otherwise somewhat mature, an immature sensation. This familiar stereotype is profoundly irritating.	Spy Kids is often exciting, funny, and almost always entertaining. It is not the kind of movie that parents should just drop their kids off to, however, but should stay for themselves to witness some of the most effective family movie moments in quite a while. In a time when family movies are completely disposable, Spy Kids proves itself to stand out from all the others and provide us with a genuine spy movie experience.

It was at the kids level without patronizing them and was believable enough for adults to enjoy too. All of the acting was high quality and the special effects first class.I shall enjoy it again in the future on video but it deserves to be seen on the big screen first.

Years later they have normal lives and have children who know nothing of any of this. When Gregorio learns of former colleagues vanishing, he looks into it, only for him and Ingrid to be captured by the evil Floop, whose children's television puppets are really mutants developed as part of building a private army for Lisp. With their parents gone and the alarm raised, Carmen and Juni learn the truth and are suddenly faced with having to rescue their parents.You shouldn't come to this movie expecting it to be serious or logical because it really isn't. Instead it is silly, goofy and really very daft but still quite good fun for slightly older children and also for adults. The plot is pretty much summed up by the title insofar as you really need to know what is going on because it doesn't make much sense. The film is really about the kids becoming spies and playing with gadgets etc on their way to becoming heroes of a sort. It never takes itself too seriously and it draws humour from this approach well, making it easy to relax and watch because, yes it's silly, but at least it knows it is silly. The Floop creations are too silly to appeal to adults but will probably provide some laughs for kids but generally the film gets the tone right for both groups.Rodriguez directs with his usual approach and I quite enjoyed the effect it had here because it does suit the silly, hyper material (which he also wrote). The effects are mainly good and it should work for most kids in the way that older boys like their gadgets and fantasy video games. The cast did it for me as well, featuring as it did a lot of people who've worked with Rodriguez before. Banderas and Gugino are both sexy and cool in the parental roles but it is Vega and Sabara who lead the film. Neither of them are typically cute kids and it helped me enjoy the film for them to be quite natural and buy into the material. Support is surprisingly classy and most of them work. I didn't like Cumming at all but that was more to do with his character; Shalhoub was OK, Hatcher was fun, Cheech pops up briefly, Patrick has a small role, Trejo is ever reliable and George Clooney puts in a small but amusing appearance.Overall this is not a great film because it all nonsense but then, as a kids' film, it doesn't matter so much. The energy, pace and sense of fun covers up for the daft central plot and nobody seems to be taking it seriously. Surprisingly fun to watch, even for adults and worth a look.

The family sticks together and although it is a very far-fetched concept, it was a movie both my children and I liked. It was filled with action and adventure but the good guys come out on top in the end against overwhelming odds. I think we could all use a little more optimism now and this movie delivers it. Carmen and Junie were not the impossibly perfect kids seen in most movies now. Nor were they brats who only care about themselves in other movies.  They were too athletic to be real children, but I'd like to think that they are showing the kids seeing the movie that they can do anything that they put their mind to.

Amazing fantasy world, some true menace, and a great message about being true to yourself and your family.Spy Kids as a family movie for the post-Matrix age. It's witty, but never falls into that oh-so-hip faux-ironic self awareness that plagues so many movies today. It hands you a fantasy world, and encourages you to believe in it.It has a great deal of action and slapstick, but (thankfully) was completely missing the mean-spirited undertones of the slapstick in Home Alone.Like all great children's literature or entertainment, Spy Kids doesn't talk down to kids. It assumes they're intelligent and can pay attention. Having said that, there are sections of the film that are hyperkinetic, but they flow naturally.It has something of a similar vibe to the Pixar films (Toy Story 1&2, Bugs Life), without as many in-jokes. There are some wonderful adult-only laughs, mostly stemming from the trials and tribulations of being a parent.It's PG for a reason. It's not for the youngest moviegoer. A mature 5 or a six-year-old is about as young as I'd recommend. There are some scary moments, ala Willy Wonka, or The Wizard of Oz. But that's good scary in my book, as opposed to needlessly scaring folks to death.The message of family is delightful. The Cortez family is a *real* family. They have disagreements, but they love each other. Thankfully, Rodriguez avoids the sit-com smartmouth syndrome, and gives us kids we can believe.And I love the fact that Rodriguez never downplays the Latino heritage of the family. Hey, I'm so Anglo I'm practically translucent, but it was such a refreshing change to not have typical whitebread heroes out to save the world.Not since Bob (Porky's) Clark pulled A Christmas Story out of his hat has a director come up with such a pleasant surprise in a genre you'd never imagine. Summary? A cup of Bond, a splash of Willy Wonka, and a dash of The Matrix. Sit back and watch the fun!

And as an added bonus, it can be watched even if you are over ten. As the far too little-known short Bedhead, Robert Rodriguez has here created a film for children, featuring children... which doesn't treat them with the lack of respect for the smarts and sense of logic that they do already possess. Adults often forget what children are like, and think of them as 'less' than the grownups. Rodriguez gives them(and us) a film that allows them a similar status to adults. The film has stuff that will appeal to kids(spy equipment hidden in children's things) but it isn't offensive to us who aren't. While it is more directed towards those of the preteen persuasion, it doesn't aim so low as to feel stupid for us who aren't of said persuasion. The plot is pretty good, though I guess it's not all that original... and as usual with children's films, the kids are the heroes, which puts too much pressure on them, as a Danish film critic so perfectly put it. The acting is a usual high(as most of the actors are quite talented), no performances really let you down, even the (intentionally)overplayed ones. The characters, many of them fairly clich√©d and thin, are all credible. As with many(most) Rodriguez films, pretty much all of those that he's written, himself... there are subplots and such, many of which are either overly easily resolved or not properly addressed. The humor is pretty good, I laughed out loud several points, rather unusual for children's films, and I was never insulted by the humor. None of it tries too hard to garner laughs, either. The special effects are quite impressive, and though it's still evident that it's Rodriguez' mini studio, it will fool you for the very most part. The action is quite intense and exciting, and like the humor, it's got Rodriguez' unique touch. Any fan of Rodriguez(such as myself, which is by far the main reason I watched this very film in the first place) will enjoy this, if maybe not to the same extent as one of his typical films. I recommend this to any fan of Rodriguez or any of the actors, and definitely most kids. Very much worth watching, even if you've outgrown childhood. Indulge your inner kid. 7/10 "},{"Title":"Good movie but I think Robert could do better!!!!","Date":"2 August 2005","Score":"5 out of 6 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Adventure, Comedy","Review":" Spy Kids was a big kids hit!

There must have been a very influential executive producer some time back pushing this idea for it to be so common.The notion of these kinds of films is to create another world, so combine that with the self-reference gimmick and you have a fantasy kiddie show about a fantasy kiddie show. More, essentially all research in self-reference for decades has been in artificial intelligence, which is the device around which this plot turns. The language of AI is LISP, the name of the archvillain. In the heyday of LISP machines, the leading system was Flavors LISP Object Oriented Programming or you guessed it -- Floop. I myself worked on a defense AI program that included the notion of a `third brain,' that is an observer living in a world different than (1) that of the world's creator, and (2) of the characters.The third is the brain of the observer. This is also a strong element in film criticism where the camera is the third eye, the eye of the artificial narrator. The most intelligent film about the third eye spying on the action is `Snake Eyes,' where we last saw Gugino. (You may want to check my comments on that film to see what I mean.)Even more this is the third time Cumming has played the evil thug Gates, the others being `Titus' and `Get Carter.' The blooper of course is that Gates wouldn't know AI if it bit him (despite buying up some of the big names from the past). So having him trapped in the virtual room is apt.The point is that there was some intelligence in this script, not all artificial.

Never have I seen a kiddie flick come along which is so clean, and yet still so entertaining at the same time. This odd blend of one of the best (The Matrix) and worst (Baby Geniuses) movies of 1999 is surprisingly exciting for something so PG, and director and writer Robert Rodriguez (From Dusk Till Dawn) manages to create loads of fun while still keeping the violence level down.He manages to do all this by being incredibly inventive with his special effects. Spy Kid's is a visual fun house of ideas which are all so playfully intuned with kids and their level of interest. He comes up with things such as movable thumb people and floors that fall apart like puzzle pieces. Rodriguez also has a lot of fun with this topic, putting in loads of high tech equipment and transportation, which offer kids and adults an incredible ride which is most always played for humor and thrills.The basic set up for Spy Kids is this. Gregorio (Antonio Banderas) and Ingrid (Carla Gugino) were both spies working for different agencies, when a hit put out on each other brings them closer together. They decide to put away the spy work and live normal lives as husband and wife, and soon father and mother.But the perfect family they dream about is far from. Their kids are keeping secrets from them, a trait from their former job that they feel they have passed on to their children. Their daughter Carmen (Alexa Vega) is skipping school, while Juni (Daryl Sabara) is being bullied at school and instead of telling his parents, just makes up a couple of imaginary friends.They see how their past lives have affected their children, but before they can correct their wrong, their past catches up with them. They are thrown back into the spy game to investigate the capture of several other spies, but only end up being captured themselves.The culprit also just happens to be Juni's favorite televison star, Fegan Floop (Alan Cumming). Floop is after a brain prototype that Gregorio created years ago. If he can implant that into the heads of his robot and mutant henchmen, nothing can stop him from taking over the world and becoming the number one rated show on TV. But his other human henchmen Minion (played dastardly well by Tony Shalhoub) has other plans. Back home, the feuding siblings must learn to work together in order to save their parents and the world as they are tossed into the spy game as well.It seems as if the best kids movies always have a family-like theme to them, and Spy Kids is no exception. Much of this movie is exciting, but then there are those other parts, which are to cuteness what Charlie's Angels was to sexy clad women. Some may accuse Rodriguez of turning corny on us all of a sudden, but luckily he is also working with some very funny material here, as well as with newcomer Daryl Sabara.His partner Alexa Vega also comes off very strong in her role as his sister. Together they are a very good crime fighting team, and I look forward to seeing them in upcoming sequels. Alan Cumming is also very good, turning in an absent minded Willy Wonka style performance that also fits in very well with Rodriguez's style for this movie, which seems to be based largely around an amusement park surrounding a James Bond movie.His film may be corny for older kids, but this is for the young ones and chances are you will never find a movie as decent and fun for them as this one is for a long time. Out of four stars, Spy Kids definitely scores a three.

I watched the first three movies quite a bit as a kid and I can even tell you why. Around the time I was into James Bond so when I saw this movie I saw it as the same except with kids (I was 7!). So watching this movie again did bring back some childhood memories but that's about all it did.The movie is about the 2 world's best spies who are married. They retire once their children are born. 9 years later the 2 kids - Carmen and Juni are keeping secrets from their parents - Carmen skips school and all of Juni's friends are as real as the CGI in this movie. Their parents find a mission to track missing agents and through that we find out a kids show host named Floop (Alan Cumming) has the technology to change people's appearances into crazy-as-hell looking characters for his show as well as build robot kids - the robot kids being for some guy's army. After they get captured it is up to Carmen and Juni to save their parents.Well to this movie's credit it has a lot of imagination to it. Which is a pretty good thing for the most part. I say for the most part because the CGI of some of them looks really dated. Not to say I still didn't appreciate the thought and effort but... yeah some of it just looks a little bit creepy to show younger children at least.The only other thing I can really say about it is Alan Cumming's performance as Floop. He just nails whimsical, head-in-the-clouds, crazy inventor, Children's TV Show Host perfectly. If I were to talk about the acting some more Alexa Vega does an okay job but Daryl Sabara is AWFUL! I mean I know I shouldn't be too harsh on him, because he's just a kid but here, I don't think he's even trying.If there was one thing I hated, and I mean LOATHED it would have to be the humour. It was terrible, I mean it might make some kids laugh but most of it is the bottom of the barrel toilet humour that dominates awful kids films.Here's another thing, we have too many morals. Or at least the screenwriter has no idea how to balance them out. On one hand we have importance of family and that message is delivered okay, but when Floop tells Juni that all it was about was purity of heart and mind, it almost comes out of nowhere. There maybe other morals that they tried to get across but I really just couldn't see them.So does Spy Kids hold up in my eyes? No, and why should it? All it has to offer in terms of quality really is one supporting performance and the imagination behind it. With that said this could entertain your 7-10 year old for an hour and a half and it is relatively harmless. If you're babysitting a kid sometime - check it out, or if you want to see how childhood nostalgia holds up.

What a rarity. I critique family films by judging if both the parent and the child will enjoy seeing the film. The parents buy the movie or the ticket for the kids, so they should both be provided with entertainment.Director Robert Rodriguez is all about special effects. So it comes as no surprise that Spy Kids relies heavily on technology. If Rodriguez had made this in the late eighties or early nineties, it would get more of a reputation as a cheesy, low budget picture, and wouldn't be remembered today in the hearts of many adolescents. If the first film would be made in 2011, we'd get the creepy hybrid of motion capture-like animation for most of this, most likely. So it's nice to see Spy Kids was made just in the nic of time when technology could produce such a fun, original picture.The story is about two youngsters, Carmen (Vega) and Juni (Sabara), whose parents (Banderas and Gugino) are undercover spies. They don't know their parents are spies, but after staying with their Uncle Felix (Marin), he tells them about their parents during an emergency, and sends both of them off to rescue their parents from an evil TV show host named Fegan Floop (Cumming).Spy Kids is only limited by the imagination from Robert Rodriguez head. My favorite scene is when Carmen and Juni are speeding on what resembles a water jet-ski pod (I'm just guessing, I really don't think Rodriguez knew what he was coming up with either), and evading the ninjas by just half a second. Something about that made me think back to when I was a kid, on my bed (or my spaceship) rolling around fighting imaginary bad guys.The CGI works, but it's flawed when it comes to the thumb creatures. The thumbs look blocky, and not very life-like. Not like anything is, but this picture was flowing perfectly up until the thumb thumbs came in. They are just assembled awkwardly, and lack animation. I was actually hoping two would go to war with each other if you know what I mean.The two leads are fairly decent actors, not perfect, but they have some time to practice, and I think these films are good places to start. The storyline was the least of my concerns, I just wanted good-humored, little to non-violent fun, and Spy Kids works. Its charm springs from the fact that it is just a kid's film, and it doesn't worry that it is being too unrealistic. It's meant to be that way.Starring Alex Vega, Daryl Sabara, Antonio Banderas, Carla Gugino, Cheech Marin, and Danny Trejo. Directed by Robert Rodriguez.

Yes, a sadistic, Burton-esque, disturbing kids show which uses mutated spies as it's actors, (more on that later) but seriously? What the heck? I seriously want to know what Muse (or lack thereof) whispered in your ear to have produced this bizarre monstrosity. Why did you choose to make the generic, faceless henchmen into THUMB PEOPLE? Why is your army of indestructible automatons disguised to look like children? Why did you have to make his base a fun house that seemed to have been designed by MC Escher in the middle of the ocean? Why are your supercomputers designed to look like little deformed cyborg brains? (perhaps to resemble the minds of the producers of this movie?) WHY?!? *Ahem, sorry.* Second reason this movie brought the art of the clich√© to an all-new level. Seriously, when my friend and I were watching this, we literally predicted EVERY plot twist. Keep in mind that we were nine-year-olds.Oh look, there's a bad guy who serves the Demon Tellytubbies show guy! I'll bet he's the REAL bad guy, and has some connection with their parent's past! or Oh, look, they introduced Uncle Machete, but he doesn't want to help. I wonder how long we'll last until he shows up to save the day? And so on and so forth. In all, they could have done WAY better with the storyline, which was pretty much just crap.Number Two Special FX Really guys, did you even try to make these effects look real? I'm all for CG animation, but honestly, you could have gotten better animation results from my 11th grade Graphic's Design class, and we were only using Photoshop! For example, during the scene when Mom and Dad Cortez drove their submarine car off a cliff, there was a glaringly visible change from real car to CG-ed car. All of the other fanciful technology (Escape Sub, Jetpacks, Thumb-Thumbs, Movie Room in Fruit-Loop Guy's castle, etc) was obviously green-screened. The lighting and shading was all off, the coloration was garish, gaudy, and generally crappy, and overall, the animation looked like a bunch of circus clowns came in and covered everything in overly polished balloon latex. It looked that fake. And don't get me started on the crummy rubber suits they did for the mutated spies. Really peoples? To quote the internet term, DERP. Number Three Psychological Damage I swear, as a nine-year old, this movie didn't die in my mind easily. Even now, many many years later, it still disturbs me. Maybe I'm overly sensitive, but I saw Lord of the Rings around the same time, and the grisly orcs didn't even make me bat an eye. Yet the Burton-esque feel to the main villain was just too much for me, and the floating eyeballs, mutated dudes with their overly happy squeaking and tittering, and tinkly music-box music didn't help. Seriously, overly cheerful and bizarre kids shows are the stuff of nightmare. It seems like they went all out to make this particular aspect as weird and disturbing as possible, and I really can't understand why. Don't get me wrong, it wasn't SCARY or intense or thrilling like a spy movie should be, it was just WEIRD. Sort of the creepy weirdness that's usually associated with clowns or carousel music. It just felt out of place and frankly, I'm surprised no-one else has sued this company for psychologically scarring their kids. I don't know how to describe it, I just was seriously weirded out by this factor.In all, this movie is scraping the barrel when it comes to entertainment, which is why I'm depressed that some relatively prominent actors like Antonio Banderas lowered their dignity and restating by participating in this blot on the name of film. Maybe they signed on before they realized what they were getting into, I don't know. The acting was the only commendable part of this film, which frankly wasn't much to work with. Kudos to you, the actors for a good effort, but not good enough to salvage this shipwreck. My only thought is that the gods must hate humanity to allow this monstrosity to exist. Which gods, you ask? ALL THE GODS! May mercy be had upon the souls of those who spawned forth this crime against art.

For anyone who is uncertain about seeing this movie, go for it. It is an original, unexpected journey, that you can see repeatedly, and will not get bored.

Saw the stills, thought they looked awful (just posing the kids defensively in front of the parents, all in a fighting stance, implies incredible irresponsibility).  I kept reading these wonderful reviews about what a delightful confection this is, and eventually I got suckered in, thinking I didn't want to miss another BABE or something, and the film was probably being poorly marketed to get the kiddies.Well, kiddies might have a good time (though in the theater I attended, restless kids had to be told repeatedly to hush, and one child articulated in the aftermath, I was hoping for more action).  But this is one where the adults will definitely need to shut their brains off.  If you're on the fence about whether or not to check this out, I'd strongly suggest not going.  It's not awful like CURLY SUE or something -- I laughed aloud once and got a couple of chuckles elsewhere -- but it is... well, it's poor.  The adventure isn't manic enough, the inventions by and large not that incredible (a packet, when microwaved, becomes a McDonald's meal.  Yipee!). SPOILERS AHEAD Yeah, the thumb thumbs are kinda cool, but the villain is far too toothless.  Kids' movies CAN survive real villainry and, in a way, need it Wicked Witch of the West, anyone?  And then when the villain goes soft and is revealed as NOT the villain, Villain #2 is even less frightening.SPOILERS OVER.  I guess one of the main problems is that the sense of threat is never tangible. The film has obviously been designed not to frighten children, giving no sense of real evil or malice onscreen (almost all critical physical contact happens either off camera or with simple karate flips).  In cushioning every blow in this manner, SPY KIDS leaves no sense of tension, danger, or conflict.  That's probably why the kids got so shifty during the screening and parents got testy; the kids saw that this emperor had no clothes -- or, more to the point, a candy colored but rather dull one-piece.  5/10 "},{"Title":"stupid","Date":"21 June 2008","Score":"4 out of 7 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Adventure, Comedy","Review":" this movie was incredibly stupid with meaning what so ever. i fell bad for all the actors and actresses that ruined there career to be in this stupid movie. the entire movie was based on how unrealistic they could make it, to make little like it which made it even stupider. even some of the names were unrealistic. the film is fun to watch which is why it had 2 out of 10 stars. this is probably the 3rd stupidest movie ever made. i got really made after i realized that it had mostly adult actors in it yet in was a kid movie. the most upsetting one was Danny Trejo a horror movie actor who is always dirty. the other actors were pretty much clean as far as i'm concerned.

I'm having trouble laughing at all the crude humour and sexist jokes in this film. I thought girls always got made fun of, not boys? Well, this film (and lots of other TV shows) proves me right that both boys and girls are made fun of, so that's why I rated this a 6/10, not a 5/10. But this film is definitely extremely sexist, and I'm surprised nobody has pointed that out. It's hard to beileve Rotten Tomatoes and Metacritic gave this film a good rating, because the special effects were terrible, the story was crap, the pacing was too fast, the crude humour wasn't too good either and the film was very sexist. I'm going to describe a little more about these flaws and about how this film is, and explain why you probably won't like it (unless you hate boys).SPECIAL EFFECTSYou feel like bashing up your television screen when you see these terrible special effects in a so-called good movie. The greenscreen is terrible, also. The thumb-thumb was a terrible special effect, the animating on it was absolutely terrible. It was hard to sit through the movie, knowing that this got great reviews, when there's something callled thumb-thumb on it. This can't even be called a movie, the special effects aren't even good-bad like films like Sharknado, Spider Man, Star Wars Episode 1 and Jaws...the special effects is just plain cringe worthy, it's hard to watch without puking all over the floor. And the crazy thing is, this cost 35 million dollars to make! I'd expect 3 million for this crap! And 3 million is way lower than 35 million! Okay, maybe you can cope with bad special effects, but can you cope with what I am going to discuss about next???STORYA simple story! Nice and simple, not too complicated! Although this flaw that I am going to talk about isn't actually too bad, it's still something to consider for you story lovers out their. Two kids, a 12 year old and a 9 year old, find out that their parents are secret agents, so they become secret agents. That's not too bad a plot...for one of those Disney channel TV movies, that is! But the plot get's worse, believe me...Techno-wizard Fegan Floop and his evil, egg- headed sidekick, Minion, capture the two kid's parents. So, a 12 year old and a 9 year old embark on a mission and become spy kids so they can save the parents in this terrible movie that will guarantee that you kill yourself! Okay, maybe you can cope with bad story, but can you cope with what I am going to discuss about next???PACINGThat's right! PACING! The one thing that bugs me in the movie Spy Kids is the pacing! It's way too fast, even for a family movie with bad special effects! As soon as you start to take a breath, another exciting part happens! The movie honestly feels like loads of exclamation marks heaping up onto your television screen, and you won't be able to see the actual movie because of all the exclamation marks! It's very hard to pay attention to the story when the pacing is god awful, especially when you can't find one part in the film where you can take a breath. I hate fast paced movies with a passion, and unless the movie has a great story behind it, I usually need something else to make me like the film. However, Spy Kids hasn't delivered me anything apart from...well, you know. But honestly, the pacing in this film is terrible, and it's hard to sit through this movie like a proper good movie. Okay, maybe you can cope with pacing (luckily), but can you cope with what I am going to discuss about next???CRUDE HUMOURFAAAAART! Hahaha, that's hilarious! THUMB-THUMB! A GUY MADE OUT OF THUMBS! Hahaha, that's hilarious! THE SISTER JUST MADE FUN OF HER BROTHER! Hahaha, that's hilarious! I hate crude humour with a passion, as it is very tasteless, and I think lots agree with me that crude humour is tasteless. Spy Kids, however, had loads of crude humour, too much to even call it a family comedy. It's basically more of a horror because of how scary that a film could be this bad. Honestly, I would list this as one of the worst movies ever, and if it weren't a box office success, and had good reviews, I would be cheering right now! I don't think there is much to talk about with crude humour though, so let's just go onto the next one. Maybe you can cope with crude humour, but can you cope with what I am going to discuss about next???SEXISMI am against this, a LOT! I hate sexism against both boys and girls, however, it really annoys me when movies like this always seem to throw insults at the boys. You could tell, because the brother always got treated like crap. He always seemed to fail in the film, and so did most other male characters in the film, I couldn't find one male character that didn't fail at least once (apart from the father of the two kids). I am surprised nobody complained about this in the bad reviews, because it is the main reason why I hate this movie with a passion. Now, come on, there's no way you can cope with sexism! Is their? Because if their is, then I guess this is the right movie for you! Unless you can cope with all the things I just told you about the film, I recommend you don't watch this film, and that's a final!

It has loads of Rodriguez's trademark imagination and vision, as well as a stacked cast and a whimsical sense of adventure that makes it a super charged Saturday morning cartoon style bucket of fun. Rodriguez makes two types of films shamelessly violent, over the top, bloody genre fun, and family orientated sci fi/fantasy for kids. He fares better in the former, as this is really the only good one in the secondary category. The sequels are trash, and I don't know what he was thinking with Sharkboy and Lava Girl, but with this one his filmmaking skill and passion for the craft work its charm and provide a wonderful experience. Newcomers Alexa Vega and Daryl Sabara play youngsters Carmen and Juni Cortez, who are surprised to learn that their unassuming parents (Antonio Banderas and Carla Gugino) are in fact lethal undercover spies, and need their help after being kidnapped by eccentric megalomaniac Floop (Alan Cumming hamming it up terrifically). Aided by their uncles Felix (Cheech Marin) and Machete (Danny Trejo) they embark on a dazzling adventure to find Floop's surreal, isolated palace, take down baddies Ms. Gredanko (Teri Hatcher) and Mr. Lisp (Robert Patrick) and save their parents. The four have amazing chemistry as a familial unit, especially when it comes time to kick major butt. The practical based effects have a wondrous vitality, from the Thumb Thumb henchman to the eye boggling, Terry Gilliam-esque realm that Floop resides in. There's also work from Tony Shaloub, Mike Judge, Richard Linklater and a sly cameo from George Clooney. No shortage of imagination, creativity and fun.

Feeding off of two separate strands, children will no doubt be consumed in the undying pleasures one equilibrium offers when two infants, one male and one female but brother and sister all the same, bicker and argue with each other as they journey on the adventure of a lifetime; essentially undertaking a quest which will see them strive to save the day and do the grown-ups a favour for a change in bailing them out of the trouble they get themselves in. The scenes and sequences are harmless enough for youngsters to enjoy and brief and charming enough for the adults seeing it with their kids to enjoy; the second strand consisting of the grown ups ambling along with parental life and cracking tired Oh, aren't we both getting old! gags which will no doubt induce grins onto that of the faces of thirty-something mums-and-dads watching on with an arm around each other and one of their two tots on either side of them.The problem being, and if like me, you land somewhere in the middle of all of this demographic pandering as a non-child whom isn't a parent and doesn't have any kids, chances are Spy Kids will be a bit of a chore; a film whose success rate in this case relies on it being an interesting and engaging enough adventure piece, something it isn't necessarily and thus doesn't quite pull through; a piece bordering on that of a monumental drag as it shuffles along doing its best to encompass people from better films that you've probably seen &#x96; by the end, I was having more fun mentally ticking off those whom had before worked with the aforementioned Rodriguez and were present here than I did from the film itself. For the Folks if your kids answer you correctly after having turned to them post-credits in order to offer them a pop-quiz on what the only other film George Clooney and Robert Rodriguez had previously worked together on, chances are you're a pretty irresponsible parent.Joking aside, the film does offer up a meek if somewhat interesting study on how to utilise teamwork and one's skills for that of good, honest and upstanding means yadda,yadda, yadda; the film effectively a tale about two nippers seemingly at war with each other coming together to foil a common enemy through hard work, dedication and working together explored in a manner which is a bit better than dull but not really as good as 'slightly interesting' - although it is done so in a rapid, punchy manner tots will enjoy. Where the kids have what is for them, everybody else will observe the ridiculously photogenic parents of the two titular Spy Kids in Antonio Banderas' Gregorio and Carla Gugino's Ingrid Cortez, respectively; two people living a seemingly normal life (whatever 'normal' constitutes in this film) in an isolated cliff-top villa hiding out as retired spies now trying to function as office workers and keeping their previous incarnations private from their offspring.Those kids are Carmen (Vega) and the younger Juni (Sabara), two more often than not at each others' throats in that innocent enough way brothers and sisters this age usually are; Juni's existence somewhat lowlier than Carmen's in that he appears weak and is easily victimised, sports warts on his hands and is disenchanted with school life. His escape from this life is that of the transporting of himself into that of the world of television; specifically, a show headed up by Alan Cumming's suitably nasty and suitably sadistic, but wholly within the boundaries of the film, Fegan Floop; a man with a colourful and joyous TV show featuring all manner of wacky characters; sets and ideas.These circles of characters will come to integrate with one another much more later on; Floop's surface existence masking something more underneath running parallel, when he's later revealed as essentially that of an arms-dealer, with that of Carmen and Juni's parents whom additionally subscribe to a cloaked living that is similar only in nature. The catalyst which kick-starts the titular kids' adventure out into the unknown; a journey encompassing the learning to co-exist with one another; the realisation of what it means to take on certain responsibilities and Juni's own realisation of the true meaning of Floop's show, which he holds so dear to him, occurs when parents Gergorio and Ingrid are swiped by an unknown quantity. From here, surprises and revelations whisk the pair off on an espionage and action imbued adventure featuring bad guys; double crosses; sordid plots and a lot of humour revolving around fully grown adults falling down. Where it's easy to sneer, and boy is it easy to sneer at Spy Kids, it is on the other hand difficult to get as excited about as one would have liked; Rodriguez demonstrating a knack for completely shifting gears and coming up with a piece acceptable to all ages which isn't exceptional but is a long way from woeful.Who knows? Like somebody whose introduction to Brian de Palma was in the shape of 1996's Mission Impossible as however young I was; maybe, in years to come, youngsters whom saw this with their folks and have such happy memories of it will discover what else Rodriguez has to offer, before quietly exclaiming that they find it hard to believe such a film here was even made by the man &#x96; let alone was their introduction to his back-catalogue of which they've come to really admire.

The movie does have flaws such as the corny wedding story at the beginning, the forced ending with the family theme pushed into the audiences' throat but other than those two aspects the movie is pretty fun. The plot is as simple as they get, Minion the generic villain has to sell killer robot children to Mr. Lisp who wants to take over the world but he needs brains for the army and that's where Mr. Cortez comes in because he helped create the Third Brain, which is an artificial brain which Minion can replicate, therefore the Cortez's kids have to rescue their parents. Kudos for Rodriguez by including such awesome cameos such as George Clooney as Devlin, Danny Trejo as another knife name bad-ass this time Machete who got his own fake trailer in the Grindhouse and later turned into a movie, and the T-1000 as Mr. Lisp! Newcomers Alexa Vega and Daryl Sabara really take the movie with their hilarious brother and sister bickering with lines such as Stop calling me names -Or what?' &#x96;Or I'll call you names&#x85; classic! Or when Juni calls Carmen the diaper lady because she still wears diapers at night and you see Carmen's reaction, hilarious. Another character that is awesome was Alan Cumming as Mr. Floop who was portrayed as a mad genius who cared more about his kids' show than his diabolical plan to take over the world. Overall this movie is worth renting but only worth buying to complete your Rodriguez collection along with El Mariachi trilogy and Planet Terror since this is essentially Rodriguez. On a side note the Fooglies and the Thumb Thumbs were very creative especially the way that the film explains that the Fooglies were victims by reversing their singing to Floop is a madman, Help us! and when Cortez begins suspecting when he sees the show and the camera zooms in at the new Fooglie with his terrified eyes.

Not only does Spy Kids qualify as a must-see for twelve-year-olds, but also Rodriguez has revamped the kids' action movie genre with style to spare! Spy Kids unfolds in the near future. Espionage agents have replaced armies, and Gregorio (Antonio Banderas of Desperado) and Ingrid (Carla Gugino of Snake Eyes) are the best. As spies on opposite sides, they receive orders to kill each other. Ironically, they fall in love, resign, marry, and raise two elementary school age children Carmen (Alexa Vega) and Juni (Daryl Sabara). Now, our ex-spies serve strictly as consultants, until several secret agents vanish without a trace. Gregorio launches a search, and Ingrid accompanies him. No sooner have they entrusted their kids to Felix Gumm (Cheech Marin Up In Smoke) than chief villain Fegan Floop (Alan Cumming) traps our adult duo. Fegan Floop masquerades as a loopy Willy Wonka type villain with his own popular children's TV show called Floop's Fooglies. Imagine Pee-Wee Herman on the prowl. Floop operates from an offshore castle shaped like an old battered boot with a candelabrum of Disney-like towers sprouting from it. Floop kidnapped those secret agents and mutated them into bizarre circus freak characters. Behind the scenes, Floop and Dr. Alexander Minion (Tony Shalhoub of Monk) scheme to replace the children of celebrities and world leaders with robotic clones. Mr. Lisp (Robert Patrick of Terminator 2) wants to buy them, so he can dominate the world. Dastardly Floop sends agents after Carmen and Juni, but the siblings elude his Thumb henchmen. Literally, these guys are all thumbs thumbs for heads, hands, and legs. Carmen and Juni fill their parents' shoes and thwart evil.Director Robert Rodriguez, whose credits include Desperado, From Dusk Till Dawn, Four Rooms, Road Racers, and The Faculty, has come a long way since 1992's El Mariachi. Typically, he saturates his sagas with buckets of blood & gore, so watching the sanitary PG-rated Spy Kids comes as quite a revelation. Aside from an occasional outburst of violence, Spy Kids poses as little a threat as a Barney episode. Nevertheless, Rodriguez stages these melodramatics with such skillful cinematic virtuosity that you find yourself sucked in by the momentum of the action. Indeed, Spy Kids qualifies as a superbly made, larger-than-life Wizard of Oz with gadgets galore that celebrates family values.

Despite their efforts to lead a peaceful domestic life, their family is slowly being torn apart by their lack of closure. They're called into action for a vital assignment to try and thwart a mad scientist/evil genius type, but when the mission goes terribly awry, the only ones who can save them are their two precocious children. Watchable, pleasant, but overly cheesy film really only works for younger audiences; although family-oriented and effective as eye candy, it would benefit from less camp and more smarts or substance. An overall air of silliness and a familiar, matter-of-fact message about the importance of family doesn't make this quite distinguished enough for all ages. **¬Ω "},{"Title":"Rodriguez's revved up kids film","Date":"6 April 2007","Score":"","Genre":"Action, Adventure, Comedy","Review":" Spy Kids is a film that falls into what I call the hidden treasure variety. Its a film that falls alongside others like Fargo, Meet the Fockers and James and the Giant Peach. These are films that all failed to strike a chord with me when I first saw them. But after I rediscovered them, they went up considerably in my estimation.My first viewing of Spy Kids was not a pleasant one. I thought it was juvenile, stupid and sloppily plotted. In short, an overrated film that didn't deserve success or a trilogy. Still, there must have been something to the film otherwise I never would have come back to it.My second viewing of Spy Kids was a complete about face. I really had a great time. It no longer seemed juvenile but witty, fresh and inventive. Amazing how a film can seem completely different after you give it a second chance.The spy genre has had a sudden boost in the last few years. Kickstarted by GoldenEye, it brought Bond into the 90s, and was then followed by Austin Powers, a parody. Then came Spy Kids. Which also proved to be influential. Not only are there the sequels, but blatant rip offs like Agent Cody Banks, and even the excellent Pixar film The Incredibles has a shade of Spy Kids.One thing that shocks you right away about Spy Kids is that it was directed by Robert Rodriguez. This is the man responsible for no-holds barred material like the exceptional Sin City, as well as sharp and biting satire like The Faculty. But to Rodriguez's credit, he hasn't dumbed down. He's brought his natural, exciting style of film-making to Spy Kids, and crafted a rip-roaring adventure kids and adults will love.I could go into detail about the plot. But I'm not going to. Its inconsequential anyway. The real fun to be had is the dazzling display of stunt-work, special effects, visual sight gags and witty puns Rodriguez keeps throwing up at us. He's not always successful with special effects. Sometimes he indulges them to such an extent they swamp everything else. The exception being Sin City, where he melded it all into a breathtaking hyper-real world. And with Spy Kids, although I did notice obvious matte lines at times, he does a commendable job, and incorporates them without sacrificing narrative structure.Rodriguez has also assembled an imaginative and quite superb cast. Antonio Banderas and Carla Gugino are good value as the retired spies forced back into action. I love the story of how they first met. If you've seen Mr & Mrs Smith you'll have a good idea of what they're like. And their heart-shaped parachutes are great.Alan Cumming is not bad as the one part children's presenter and other part criminal mastermind. Sort of like a cross between Pee-wee Herman and a Bond villain if such a thing is possible. And Tony Shalhoub is great as the power behind the throne. So is Fegan Floop's stronghold. A set so full of eye popping effects and surreal wackiness you're constantly blown away by what the filmmakers have gotten away with. Love the jigsaw puzzle floors too!But where Spy Kids really shines is Alexa Vega and Daryl Sabara as the dynamic duo. They make a completely believable brother and sister. Affectionately sniping at each other while propelled by jet pack, piloting submarines and using quick dry cement that looks like Silly String. The whole film rests on their capable shoulders. Vega is especially impressive. She has that rare ability among children where she can seem capable but gracious, and Rodriguez draws out a great deal of strength from her character.The gadgets and gimmicks the writers come up with are very innovative. They beat the pants off anything Q could come up with. I'm especially partial to the electrically charged gum balls. And the dozens of robot kids put films with much higher budgets like I Robot and Bicentennial Man to shame. I love the use they're put to in the end.There are so many delights to this film. The sight of Teri Hatcher getting her hair burned off by jet pack is worth the price of admission alone. And watch out for George Clooney's cameo at the end.I'm glad I rediscovered Spy Kids. If I hadn't, I would have been missing out on a superior piece of family entertainment. Spy Kids soars just as high as any of this film's jet packs.

The film is the first in a long line to use the idea of child spies as the plot device with the story itself centring on twelve-year-old Carmen and her eight-year-old brother Juni as they strive to rescue their spy parents from the grasps of Floop, a campy TV presenter with dreams of world domination.There are, of course, an abundance of special effects in the film that are of a decent quality and a number of intriguing James Bond-like gadgets make their appearance. However, what makes this film engaging is the interesting story that walks a neat line between being moralistic without preaching (we have the typical sibling fights but they band together in tough times as well as topics such a trust and familial loyalty being touched on) and not taking itself seriously (the adult characters are there mainly as comic relief back-up to the child leads and they revel in this role). Also, the child actors, Alexa Vega as Carmen and Daryl Sabara, show they are talented enough to carry off the bulk of the film themselves with limited support from Antonio Benderas and Carla Gugino, who play their screen parents.Unlike the lukewarm sequels, 'Spy Kids' is the kind of children's flick that older family members won't mind watching since the funny and action-packed plot and appealing performances by all the actors involved provide fun for a wide age range. In fact, the only problem I have with this film is that we can predict many mediocre copy-cat films, using the child spy concept, to be produced for the next five or six years until another fresh idea comes along, ripe for the rip-off.

When they are kidnapped by the villainous Floop and Minion, who are building a robot army of copies of world leaders' children, the two kids must learn lots of spy stuff fast so they can rescue them. Along the way they enlist the help of their estranged Uncle Machete, escape from the double-agent Miss Gradenko and confront evil robot versions of themselves.This is a wonderful action-packed comedy spy movie which rattles along non-stop and is packed full of funny characters and Rodriguez' tremendous visual style. It somehow manages to romanticise spy movies and cheerfully send them up at the same time, and there are many terrific action/effects scenes (the kids' escape in a mini-submarine, the jetpack chase scene, a helicopter ride). The terrific cast give it their all - I particularly like Gugino, Trejo and Patrick, but everyone is great and Vega and Sabara hit just the right notes as the kids. They are kinda cute, but they argue good-naturedly; Vega has a great long-suffering quality and Sabara is just plain irresistible as the put-upon Juni, who not only has to save the world but get rid of his warts too. The movie is zippily shot by Guillermo Navarro (who has a walk-on as a minister), has some great music by Danny Elfman and features some cool special effects makeup by the Kurtzman/Nicotero/Berger group. Rodriguez made this movie as a labour of love for his children and it shows in every frame - it's just so much fun, and has a great underlying theme of families looking out for each other in the face of crises. He wrote, directed, edited and co-produced the picture, and also co-wrote the music and co-supervised the effects. This is a great director and a man who makes movies to entertain.

Mellowing in his (slightly) old age he has created a film that his children could watch and enjoy. He wrote, produced, directed and even edited this film, and deserves as many awards as possible. Spy Kids is a film that the whole family will think is cool. Hopefully Hollywood is realising that the best kids films, both commercially and artistically, are ones that the parents will enjoy as well. Spy Kids is full of unusual characters, amazing special effects, jokes by the bucket load and even celebrity cameos to boot. I took my little brother to see it, and he loved it. Briefly, so as not to give too much away, Antonio Banderas stars as a secret agent who, along with his secret agent wife, has retired from the spy game to raise a family. They are persuaded to go on one final mission to investigate the whereabouts of some other missing agents, where things start to wrong (with hilarious consequences), and the children are unwittingly called upon to save them.This is one film that all kids should see, along with the rest of their family.

We were ALL pleasantly surprised by what could easily have been a REALLY stupid movie, but what ended up being a truly entertaining, family-friendly film.  A fun story, extremely interesting and entertaining characters and an uplifting message all add up to a successful film in Spy Kids.The family is the fundamental unit of society and such is made particularly evident in this film.  When Carmen and Juni are forced into the spy world to save their parents, Gregorio and Ingrid Cortez (played by the almost comical Antonio Banderas and the stunning Carla Gugino), they strengthen their relationship not only with them but, more interestingly, with each other.  The appeal of Alexa Vega and Daryl Sabara's characters is that they're so realistic--they act (and fight) like real sister and brother.  In the end, though, it's their differences and their ability to see past them that leads them to victory.Cameos by George Clooney, Cheech Marin and Teri Hatcher, as well as Tony Shalhoub as Minion and Alan Cumming as Floop add an definite element of the bizarre and the eccentric, but undeniable fun to the film, not to mention selected music by Danny Elfman.  Sure, the kids aren't seasoned actors, and sure, the story isn't the MOST complicated plot in recent film history, but the message was enough to make it a keeper for us.  Robert Rodriguez has really done something amazing (writing, directing, composing, etc.), and has created a film that will stand as a sadly underappreciated gem.A great start to what is undeniably a memorable series of films.9/10.

It is clearly a better picture for young and old. This thoughtful adventure was created by Robert Rodriquez. Surprising, after seeing Desperado and Once Upon A Time In Mexico in his filmography. Being a veteran for intense action films, Rodriquez still breathes life in this movie, aimed at kids and yes, even adults. In fact, this movie could even be compared to Pixar's films Solid entertainment for kids and witty and sophisticated for adults. And live action? Finally!The plot finds Antonio Banderas (Desperado) and Carla Gugino (The One) star as Gregorio and Ingrid Cortez, retired secret agents, though unknown to their two kids, Juni (Daryl Sabara) and Carmen (Alexa Vega). However, when loony television show host Fegan Floop (Alan Cumming) searches for a mysterious power to give life to his army of child robots, he kidnap the two spy parents. But after learning their true identity, Carmen and Juni stock up on spy gadgets and gizmos and set off on a quest to rescue their parents and stop Floop from (surprise!) ruling the world. But could there possibly be someone else stirring in the plot?Sure, the story isn't overly complicated and everything has a goofy look to it, but I didn't watch a movie called Spy Kids to come and expect Citizen Kane. This is simply better-than-average and wholesome entertainment for kids and adults. The movie never ditches any sides of the story and cuts back to both the spy kids and spy parents. There's also some time with the relationship between the two villains Floop and his minion, properly named Minion (Tony Shalhoub). This film is not so much about gadgets and special effects than it is about characters. Rodriquez breathes life into these characters and the chemistry between them is where your investment will begin.The relationship between Carmen and Juni is second to none. They're both very fine actors. Their dialogue is never forced and their chemistry never fizzles even in the movie's stale moments. Like the film's visuals, they and their characters are colorful, fun and inventive. Alexa Vega, particularly, probably has the most potiental to be the better actor of the two, with Daryl Sabara having a few one-liners thrown down the drain. The adult actors, Antonio Banderas and Carla Gugino, are likable and charming as the spy parents but it is Alan Cumming, as the delightfully wicked Fegan Floop that steals the show. The movie never focuses on the children 100% which allows Cumming to ham it up everytime he appears.The film was made with about a $30 million budget, but the special effects look curiously more focused than the ones found in Harry Potter (which still makes me wonder where that $125 million budget went to). Don't walk in to expect the best of the best in special effects. When a person (or even a thumb) is flying around in a jet pack, it's easy to tell it's done by computer. Though the flying sequences are not the most exhilerating part of the film, it is the color and bouncy images found in the sets and locales. Floop's castle is lively and energetic but never tries to take itself too seriously.Well, what else can I say? This is fun and intelligent family entertainment. There is never a too serious moment and the kids are both charming and likable.

Robert Rodriguez is the writer and director of such bloody, ultra-violent action fair as `Desperado', `From Dusk &#145;Till Dawn' and &#145;The Faculty' (my favorite), so it comes as kind of a surprise to see him diving neck-deep into this PG-rated family film. Rodriguez is an imaginative filmmaker, and with Spy Kids more then ever before that imagination is let loose like a wild dog to ravage every aspect of the production. This gives us some gleaming moments like a fight scene inside a rapidly spinning merry-go &#145;round and  a surprise bit in the final scene involving a cameo from George Clooney that is pretty ingenious. In fact, the real stars of the film are not Antonio Bandaris and Carla Gugino and not even the spy kids (Alexa Vega and  Daryl Sabara), but the `thumb soldiers'.  Life-size beings whose limbs (`arms', `legs', and `head') are made of nothing but giant thumbs, the thumb soldiers are one of those rare special effect creations that show us something we've never seen before. It needs to be seen to be believed. Rodriguez has them fumbling and sliding around, trying to catch things and at one point breaking into a home in ski masks and full fatigues. It is hilarious. Rodriguez throws so much at as, with such vibrant visuals and at such a frenzied pace we don't quite grasp how cheesy and unsatisfying the movie is until it settles down a bit in the 3rd act when it gets past the parade of visual bits and attempts to pull together the strings and resolve it's story.  It's like being dropped out of a tornado and shaking your head wondering where you are &#150; and why you've been putting up with this kind of stuff. The movie doesn't fall apart scene by scene like many others. Instead, I just started getting the sinking impression that what I was seeing - and what I had been seeing - was a movie that was not going to grow beyond it's set-up and amount to much. It's not even necessarily that the screenplay did anything to snap me away from it (accept for, maybe, a scene where Vega's robot punches through a concrete pillar), but as it progressed I just more and more, felt the potential (and potential charm) being drained away and it pulling at my tolerance. Instead of building on itself, it seems to just be throwing whatever Rodriguez thinks might look cool at us. He gives us a fairly original set-up and then runs his kids through the type of lame action scenes we've grown so tired of in adult movies. The family friendly twists can only sustain the movie so long.  Rodriguez also aims to satirize nonsensical children's programming &#150; similar to The Teletubbies. But what might have sounded good on the page doesn't play out as edgy and topical as it wants to be. It just seems creepy. The always engaging Alan Cumming (fresh off `Josie and the Pussycats') as the villain of the piece gets strained through Rodriguez's mainstream kid's movie template and falls out the other side looking foolish and giving typical syrupy motivational speeches. The premise is one of child empowerment. I can't help but admire Rodriguez more as a director for going for this, but it's not like he is breaking any new ground here &#150; this is a pretty standard kid movie theme. His movie strains to be hip and twisted, but then will fall back on usual cornball antics and pounding in sappy messages about the importance of family. It's an incredibly awkward mix. While Bandaris and Gugino are the big stars and get the big credits, the centerpieces of the movie are the two young leads. Vega and Sabara carry the movie like pros, and without being shackled with any cute kid antics. Alexa Vega, in particular, could be a big star in the making.

For example, if you read my comments on crime or gangster movies, I'll usually start off by telling the reader whether the filmmakers succeeded in making it past that particular hurdle Convincing me to to see criminals as human beings whose fate I should care about.Spy Kids is billed as a film for the whole family, which is code language for saying that your 2-year old should be able to stay put through the whole thing (assuming a diaper change just before the opening credits). The challenge of this kind of movie is that it should also succeed in having something to say to the oldsters. I'm not saying that it has to work on the level of genius for each and every member of your family, from Baby to Gramps. But it has to do *something*, and Spy Kids does nothing for Gramps (that is, for me).I expected Spy Kids to have a moral dimension. You have to understand that this didn't have to be sacrificed to an abiding interest in keeping the triangular-pants set at bay. No sacrifice was necessary; I think it's just sloppiness and laziness and a lack of high expectations on the part of the producers, writers, and filmmakers. I can think of one film that shows these expectations are entirely reasonable Babe. Babe was eminently watchable by children AND deeply moved me at the end, so lovely and touching and fully integrated was the profound moral. (*Don't* ask me about Babe II...).I suppose some may say, Didn't you see the moral of Spy Kids? That families are these happy, warm environments where kids can feel secure! And I suppose there was something of a clever play of ambiguity on the concept of security. But in the end, it wasn't enough for me. It may be in part because I'm sort of a stickler for the idea of sharing and full disclosure, against which the very idea of spying is a kind of moral rape. So I have trouble sidling it up against the security of hearth and home and characterizing that contrast as cute and family entertainment. Also, the appeal to hearth-and-home is a kind of obvious one-note-johnny; we all know that families are these secure places. Tell me something I *don't* know. Perhaps my definition of security needs upgrading. Maybe, as the movie happily and innocently hints, I need to relax in the knowledge that security sometimes means the state privileges that international lying and duplicity brings. I mean, what's *really* the point here? I'm too old to see spying as anything but profound ugliness on the spiritual level. So I guess this is family entertainment for the family without eyes to see that it's not really funny.Sorry about the rant. I'll back off a bit and just say; really, cool effects and action-for-action's sake without a properly integrated moral dimension doesn't cut it for me. It'll keep my 2-year-old from squirming, but it doesn't stop me from expecting more. I characterize this movie as ultimately cold and unfeeling, despite the pretty, ostensibly cosy and happy faces we see on the screen.

As for Rodriguez, I  believe he is positioning himself to be a sort  of Spielbergian type of director. While his  ideas are a little more unusual, he is slowly  stepping down from the graphic, violent films  to movies you can take your kids to. Hopefully,  with this film, he has beaten M.

While doing press for Desperado, Rodriguez claimed he was trying to create a hero for the Hispanic and Latino community, akin to Chow Yun Fat in John Woo's movies. He accomplishes this and much more in Spy Kids, and refreshingly without any of the Pc hang-ups that his predecessors and contemporaries often fall victims to. You'll find no lamentations on the racial condition here, just a family of crime fighters who just happen to be Hispanic, and a story that just happens to take place in Spain. Having long since proven himself a more than capable director, Rodriguez stretches his storytelling muscles in the unfamiliar arena of a children's film. Gregorio and Ingrid Cortez are retired spy parents to their precocious children Carmen (Alexa Vega) and Juni (Daryl Sabara). Although wowed by their mother's bedtime stories, which recount unbeknownst to the kids, the adventures of the Spy Parents, Carmen and Juni find their parents boring, and suffer from the usual problems that plague children. Carmen is the bossy older sister who `just wants out of this family' (indeed everyone has a bone to pick with another family member) and pokes fun at her brothers perpetual state of fright. Juni is the younger brother with his head in the clouds, shy with imaginary friends, and a hand full of warts. Juni's only real interest seems to be in the children's show Floog's Fooblies. Gregorio's secretive ways are blown when he and Ingrid are called back into duty to help locate several kidnapped spies. When the aforementioned Floog, who'd been mutating the spies into Fooblies, captures them the kids are awakened to their parents' past and forced to save them. In a nutshell this is the plot of Spy Kids, but what's the most enjoyable (and what should be in all adventure stories of this kind) is the trip getting there. Once introduced to their spy lineage by their ''fake' uncle (Cheech Marin), Carmen and Juni are meant to make sense of the various spy gadgets their parents own, as well as piecing together a plan to save their parents, not to mention who to trust while doing so. Their journey takes them to San Diablo, where they meet their estranged real uncle Machete (Danny Trejo), who is a master spy gadget maker, through the ocean in a submarine, and finally to Floog's island. What allows Spy Kids to truly call itself a `family film', is that as Carmen and Juni's journey progresses, so does their understanding and appreciation of family. What makes such a clich√©d moral bearable, not to mention fresh, is Rodriguez's story telling and direction. Awesome-as-usual cinematography from Guillermo Navarro, and Rodriguez's action sequences make you forget you're watching a children's movie, let alone one with a message present in every bad children's movie you've ever seen. Imagine the slow- motion-trench-coat- shots for Hong Kong action films scaled down to four-foot level. It's good to see Rodriguez and his stable of actors back on target after the Faculty.

We know that Alex and Junie will run rings around their parents, not because their parents are the kind to have rings run around them (they're not), but because it's a kids' movie, and that's what kids like.  We know that Junie will prove to be as competent as Alex, not because we sense him to have any latent strength or intelligence (we don't), but because if he didn't then young boys would presumably have nobody to root for.  It doesn't matter if children really are as venal and unimaginative as Rodriguez assumes.  I wouldn't be surprised if it turned out that most children were.  That's no excuse.  Rodriguez's responsibility was not to babysit these children for an hour and a half, but to make a good film.  He's clearly talented enough to have done so.  He even had the right material to make a good film that, most likely, children would have loved (such things happen from time to time).

Of course, children merely mimic the fantasies adults themselves indulge in &#150; utilizing the same set of conventions that serve as the template for virtually all action/adventure films that have featured heroes on the order of James Bond, Rambo, and Arnold Schwarzenegger in his various fictional guises.  In many ways, the films featuring those characters demonstrate that many of us have still not outgrown the simplistic view of the world that fuels our earliest fantasies.  By making the heroes of this film specifically children, `Spy Kids' fulfills that need children have to feel that they too can be an active part of a power-conferring fantasy rather than just the passive observers they usually end up being in a real world controlled by adult concepts and adult rules.Fair enough.  What I don't understand, though, is why adults seem to be so enamored of `Spy Kids,' which, for all its hullabaloo and hubbub, is really little more than a juvenile version of the same spy spoof nonsense that has been a staple of filmmaking since the 1960's (nicely resurrected by the `Austin Powers' films a few years back).  Antonio Banderas and Carla Gugino star as Gregorio and Ingrid Cortez, two dashing former spies who have traded in the exciting world of field espionage for less glamorous `desk jobs' in the spy organization so that they can raise their two children, Carmen and Juni, in a more normal, less hectic and less dangerous environment.  Carmen and Juni, unaware of their parents' past, look upon them as two hopelessly nerdy representatives of an `uncool' older generation.  When Gregorio and Ingrid decide, after nine years out of commission, to get back into the secret agent business, they discover that some of their espionage skills have become a little rusty and they are instantly caught and imprisoned by a mad children's show producer bent on creating a race of indestructible children robots.  When Carmen and Juni discover the truth of their parents' identities and predicament, the two youngsters set off on a mission to singlehandedly rescue them from a fate worse than death.One of the problems with `Spy Kids' is that it seems to mistake frenetic activity for humor and wit.  Through long stretches of the film, we are being hurtled through space in one imaginary vehicle after another as the children search desperately for their kidnapped parents.  There is, moreover, an awful lot of frantic running around by the various characters, but the result is, oddly, not excitement but rather tedium.  Because writer/director Robert Rodriguez has failed to provide any truly clever dialogue, he has been forced to rely far too heavily on the special effects to carry the day.  The result is that we are never particularly captivated by the antics either of the children or of the parents, who, I hasten to note, actually spend most of their time off screen.   When they are on screen, they often come across as arch, self conscious and cutesy, rather than smooth, suave and witty.   Alexa Vega and Daryl Sabara, as the two children, are unremarkable but relatively likable screen presences.  At least they are not as cloying as their parents.  The art director, set decorator and production designer deserve mention for their superb work in creating a never-never land world caught somewhere between reality and fantasy, perfectly suitable for a film built on childhood imaginings.   It's too bad that the screenplay fails to consistently match that level of creativity.  Stand by for the inevitable sequel!

Though I wasn't too impressed by his debut film, El Mariachi, I enjoyed his later efforts (i.e.  Desperado, The Faculty and one of my personal favorites--From Dusk Till Dawn).  He has a great knack for producing flashy, slam-bang action sequences.  Naturally, you won't see too much of that in this film--being that it's aimed towards an 8 and younger demographic.  The little violence we see is very mild.One thing I did appreciate was the use of Hispanic actors.  Very rarely do we see a mainstream motion picture with a predominantly Hispanic cast. Even the two young leads (Alexa Vega and Daryl Sabara) have a Spanish background. We also have an array of Rodriguez regulars, including Cheech Marin, Danny Trejo (who has a nice little role that supercedes his typecasting as a shallow tough guy), Antonio Mr. Handsome Banderas, Robert Patrick and...I'll keep the last actor as a surprise.  He appears in a brief cameo at the end, and yes he has appeared in one of Rodriguez's past films. Anyway, Hispanics are one minority we really don't see too often in cinema and it's nice that a movie like this comes by and lets them show off their talents.The plot is, well, corny.  But it's a kiddie flick, so I tried to let that slide.  Unfortunately, we go through some of the same Home Alone-esque situations involving the two kids crowded by a group of high-tech villains, and they somehow get away scott-free with the help of slapstick violence. OK, I get it.  Kids rule.  Adults suck.  Isn't that the message of all these flicks?  Though I would say this is moderately easy-to-take considering the majority of kid-oriented flicks like this, we do have to sit through some annoying bickering between the two kids.  We could've done without the gratuitous name-calling.  However, I have to give credit to the kids for their natural performances.  I appreciate any kid actor who can deliver witty dialogue without appearing as if he or she is reading off cue cards.As for the actors I didn't mention...Alan Cumming is amusingly evil as the villainous host of a top-rated children's show.  Tony Shalhoub is amusing as his partner in crime.  Teri Hatcher is beautiful as always.  Even when she had half her scalp burned off, I think she looked hot.  )Rodriguez added a nice Latin mix to his funky soundtrack.  There's humor here and there that winks at the grown-up viewers.  Some of it's pretty damn funny.  I liked when Banderas hugged his crying, long-unseen brother (Trejo) and says, He's real emotional...Latinos.  But more often than not, we journey into Saturday morning kid's show territory and of course, we have to end with a PC message about family values and all that stuff.  *Snore*If any of you grown-ups got kids, this is not a bad movie to rent.  It's a fun movie to watch with your young ones.  Those without kids...you might want to explore other options.My score  6 (out of 10) "},{"Title":"I think they've gotten smarter since the last time we met! (regarding Spy Kids robots)","Date":"19 September 2001","Score":"","Genre":"Action, Adventure, Comedy","Review":"  SPOILERS - Being a big fan of Robert Rodriguez's initial effort with El Mariachi, I was curious to see what he could do with a PG rated family comedy, Spy Kids.  It is a fun movie, and refreshing that there are no bad words, no adult sexual references.  The closest they come is the utterance of Oh, shi-take mushrooms. The premise of the film is a good start - mom and dad are retired spies who are activated for a big job. When they are captured, the son and daughter have to quickly learn to become kid spies to rescue their parents. While overall entertaining, the film felt a bit uneven, unbalanced at times. Some of the underwater and flight effects seemed a bit cheesy, and some of the dialog a bit awkward. The whole film reminded me of Austin Powers, but the bad guys aren't quite as bad.The DVD has excellent colors, and the Dolby 5.1 sound track is very good. However, there are no extras related to Spy Kids, only several selectable advertisements for other products. Definitely a budget DVD. I rate the film 7 of 10, and a fun, escapist 85-minute film.

If you liked Inspector Gadget or Jumanji or even Cats and Dogs you will probably like Spy Kids.  I would not attempt to over analyze this movie.  It was just good old fashioned spy adventure with kids as the main characters.  I really did not notice any references to ethnicity as a reviewer mentioned.  A few audience members who were thinking this was a spoof or satire were way off base in their yuppie sheltered worlds but most people liked this film for what it was.  It was meant that we laugh with the characters not at the characters.  This was just fun with good special effects.  I hope it does well.Also Antonio Banderas shows his versatility here far away from ranging from Thirteenth Warrior to now a father spy in Spy Kids.  I have not yet seen his other new film Original Sin or some but I am sure it is a far cry from Spy Kids.  Also it was refreshing to see the mother played as an exciting person rather than the usual henpecking boring yuppie character.  She is fresh.

From the beginning until the aftermath the film is full of ingenious takes and gags.Now, is it really for everyone?...I think not. While I was watching it, I was having one of the best times in this year, I was delighted by it. But then I saw my girlfriend yawning, and that's when it all came down. This film is mainly for kids, they will have the best time ever watching the film, having their parents buying them all the merchandise that is out on the stores and buying the Happy Meals to see what's in them. Suddenly I felt like a child accompanied by an adult, and later on while commenting on the movie with some friends, nobody liked it, and some even though it was an insult to intelligence.But after giving it some though, I realize there is nothing wrong with me, if I am a child inside and this is the kind of film that suits me, it is OK. So, if you are a child at heart this film is for you, if not, stay away from it before it's too late.Also, what I like about Robert Rodriguez is how he breaks the stereotypes and manage them.

Better to rent an old, safe Disney flick or tape something from PBS.A realization, though, is now hot on the lips of Hollywood execs - a realization spearheaded by Rodriquez - that if a quality family film is created for children that is not a vulgar embarrassment or a chance for a quick nap for bored parents with their offspring in tow, paying audiences will attend. Gee whiz. Imagine that...Rodriquez is a man of vision, a man of family values, and a man of hands-on follow-through. According to the LA Times, he not only wrote, directed, and co-produced Spy Kids, he was also the editor and camera operator, and shared credit as music composer, visual-effects supervisor, and rerecording mixer. He reportedly flew to Chile to personally shoot background film footage. He concocted several of the astonishing spy gizmos used in the film. Did I mention that he is a working maniac?Latinos not only dominate the main cast of this film, but most are the good guys. This is an understated but positive sign that negative stereotypes in film may be crumbling.Imaginative, spirited, fast-paced, family-oriented, and highly amusing (a lot of it is just delightfully weird), Spy Kids is a must-see for elementary school-aged audiences (OK, many older kids will love it, but they won't let on). The kids in the film act refreshingly like normal kids, the parents like loving parents - it's all tied together with a delectable espionage angle.

Add to that an incredibly strong cast (Antonio Banderas, Alan Cumming, Tony Shaloub, Cheech Marin, Teri Hatcher).  Also, a comedy where the characters take themselves seriously - don't look for the Burt Reynolds wink and a nod school of comedy here.  The performances are so restrained in what is, after all, a satire of spy films, that you can forgive the occassional bit of overacting.The film has at is core a very adult theme, secrets and how they can keep us from getting close to each other.  This family is in trouble because they are all keeping secrets from each other - the big secret being that mom and dad are spies, a fact they hide from their kids who are incredulous when they learn the truth.  However, that's just the biggest of a web of tiny lies that unravel quickly as the plot unfolds. I can't wait to add this to my video collection.  I'm also hoping that there will be a sequel.

They want stuff their kids can like that is clean and doesn't understand why Hollywood doesn't make films like that. (Of course, when studios did make clean films - which were also clean of entertainment value - the parents didn't go and the studios gave up.)The best I can say is that this film is clean and has sufficient entertainment value to keep kids and some adults entertained. But it isn't the triumph of the human spirit that some are claiming. First of all, it's too active; it substitutes Nickelodeon-style gadgets and set design, and lots of inexpensive CGI, for character and story. If you doubt this, ask yourself; what makes these kids special, besides their Hispanic heritage? The young boy has warts from nervousness. That's it. We don't get to know much about the kids before the afterburners kick in and we're pinned to the seat with all those effects.Second, the villains have the same minimal motivation as the baddies on the various Power Rangers series. In a time when Harry Potter's villains have real motivation - hatred of muggles being a kind of racial prejudice - there's no challenge and triumph in villains without it. These guys are cardboard targets, just waiting to be knocked over.Third, the most unique plot element - taking a Willy Wonka-style kid hero and making him a villain - is fumbled. His transformation from bad guy to innocent dupe isn't handled well. How innocent is a guy who creates the thumb warriors, fills his headquarters with traps and deliberately allows the use of a machine that mutates humans into Oompa-Loompas? Or who allows these things to be used without much obvious protest?My only other complaint is that Cheech Marin, perhaps the most entertaining performer in the film (and one who is known to kids from other kid shows) is in the film far too briefly. It's acceptable as a kid film, but I don't think Michael Eisner will lose much sleep over it.

But all of us were swept away by  SPY KIDS' pure entertainment value. My children and I were on the edge of our chairs, laughing, gasping with amazement, and at the end of the film we were all drained yet satisfied.I predict that this film will become a family classic. Although it is totally different from films such as A CHRISTMAS STORY and MY DOG SKIP, like those it is a gem that will always stay fresh, will have an endless shelf life through DVD and cable TV, and will be entertaining my children's children.Mr. Rodriguez is to be commended for following his own individual vision yet not forgetting how to please an audience.

Rodriguez, whose frantic camera work and editing make his previous films like Desperado and From Dusk Till Dawn seem like kids' movies for grown-ups, must apparently recognize that something drastic has been missing from the family genre for many years.  That something, as I've noticed anyway, is a healthy dose of evil.  It's interesting to note that some of the most memorable childrens' fare of all time contained, for the most part, some really twisted stuff.  The mere mention of the phrase Willy Wonka conjures images of frightening Oompa-Loompas, and deeper recollection of the Gene Wilder (aaahh!) musical serves us visions of the rather gruesome elimination of misbehaving children and the beheading of a chicken.  In the 80's, Jim Henson gave us a baby-napping Goblin King in Labyrinth as well as a world of grotesque critters and monsters in The Dark Crystal.  The same, unfortunately, cannot be said for the 90's and beyond, which have failed to provide much more sinister fare than 1996's wonderfully disturbing Matilda and the late Gene Siskel's final Best Film of the Year, 1998's Babe Pig in the City.  Luckily, in Spy Kids, we are treated to a cornucopia of wickedry in the form of a dim-witted kid's show host and his horribly deformed sidekicks (the result of crude experiments performed on missing secret agents).  These elements, along with kinetic pacing, funky set design and an obligatory moral message for the tykes make Spy Kids one of the best family films since Full Metal Jacket.

Clearly a loving tribute to his three children and his spanish heritage, Spy Kids is an entertaining, wholesome and very likeable film.  I've noticed how cynical hollywood has been lately- it seems like most movies are made by these arrogant little guys that seem like they have something against their audience (dumbing down plots, throwing in dumb twist endings, etc.).  Spykids is a refreshing change and clearly the work of someone in love with film.  I especially liked how only the villains talked down to the children - very cool.. Yes, the product placement was a little bothersome, but the frenetic pace and touching (yet not cheesie) msg. all worked extremely well..

For the first time in a long time, I've seen a movie targeted at kids that does what a kids movie should do be as imaginative and as vibrant and alive as they are.  Everyone in this movie looks like they're having a great time, and it definitely rubs off.  It's an kinetic thrill ride from start to finish, overflowing with action and wit and special effects.Instead of totally rehashing the plot, I recommend that everyone (no matter how old you are) see this movie.  No matter how cynical you are, if you go in with an open mind you should be entertained.  This movie has so many surprises that the less you know going in, the more you'll take from it. (But at the same time, if you know the entire plot, you'll still enjoy it).With a horrible movie like See Spot Run passing for a family film these days, it's great to see a movie that doesn't have to resort to gross out jokes.  It doesn't insult your intelligence, it sparks your imagination. Spy Kids only looks all the greater in comparison,  because instead of trying to capitalize on the worst type of childlike humor (that move was much more immature than any ten year old I've ever met), it banks on the spirit of imagination.The film critic in me wants to mention that there are a few flaws to this movie, but nothing that can't and shouldn't be overlooked.  The movie has a few pacing problems, and some effects shots could be smoother.  But really, who cares besides nit-pickers who don't want to admit that they were entertained?One of the greatest assets is the dialogue.  It's obvious that the writer/director Robert Rodriguez came from a huge family (ten children) because he really has an ear for how siblings talk to each other, and how children react to certain situations. All the performances in the film, especially that of the two children, are just fun to watch.This film has a great message of family unity and standing up for yourself and believing that you are good enough...  and it's a message that kids could really use.After seeing this movie the audience will be divided into two groups those who had a good time, and those who felt embarrassed that they had a good time so they'll use words like cheesy to describe it.  Of course it's cheesy, I would expect nothing less from a movie that is supposed to capture the minds and hearts of children.  And since when is cheesy a bad thing?  Doesn't it literally mean innocent and child like?This film made me feel younger and vibrant.  I absolutely loved it.  I just wish I had children of my own take to it.  Maybe I'll call up my sister and take my nephews to the theatre, just so I can have an excuse to see this again.I think the greatest mystery is how this movie only cost $36 million to make...

BRAVO to writer-director Robert Rodriguez!","Date":"1 April 2001","Score":"","Genre":"Action, Adventure, Comedy","Review":"  Unlike his From Dusk till Dawn 1996, there's no swear words, blood & guts, or ballet of bullets in Rodriguez's SPY KIDS. It is of solid entertainment value and with high creative energy - equal to a Bond film. The premise is a fantasy adventure truly for kids, while the adults can enjoy along with the ride. Everything - storyline, plot progressions, characters, scenes, sets, costumes, makeup, and special effects with techno-gadgets galore - is fun and in lively colors and imageries, with little inventive surprises here and there. The pace is unarguably right on - full 90 minutes of a thoroughly delightful mix of spy-venture and sci-fi family movie.Antonio Banderas is Dad, Gregorio Cortez, and Carla Gugino is Mom, Ingrid Cortez, both were once super secret agents unbeknown to their two kids - the heroes of the story Alexa Vega is daughter Carmen, Daryl Sabara is son Juni. The two young heroes may seem ordinary and vulnerable, and no smarter than any other kids, but that's the down to earth aspiring quality we want to believe in - that anyone of us can jump into such an adventure and cope as they do! The movie is loaded with graphic delights, comic book style as they may be. For instance, just within the adult Cortez's room at a glance, one gets a chuckle over the interesting keyboard that Mom has vs. Dad's workstation. Playful inventiveness is reminiscent of Tim Burton's Edward Scissorhands 1990; the gadgetry-loaded interiors of the Safe House and at Uncle Machete's went beyond Disney's Inspector Gadget 1999.Alan Cumming is exquisite as Fegan Floop, the children's TV program genius - the hero in Juni's eyes. Tony Shalhoub, once again, after Galaxy Quest 1999, took on a light-hearted role and is willing to poke fun at himself, including adorning an interesting headdress! The Floop's theme song is by Danny Elfman - the tune reminds one of the Elfman touch distinctive to his film scores like Tim Burton's The Nightmare Before Christmas 1993, and Edward Scissorhands. Somehow with all this fast-pace ventures, Juni became the one (increasingly confident and unsuspectingly smart by simply being himself the kid) who helped Floop to get out of his psychological predicament and concentrated on solving the problem at hand to save the world. SPY KIDS is produced by Troublemaker Studio (truly fun as its namesake!) with Dimension Films, a division of Weinstein brothers' Miramax Films; I hope it gets the marketing promotion it deserves - such a rare diamond of a decent family fun movie these days. I dream of it reaching top ten status, and perhaps another family mission for the Cortez bunch yet to come.If the sci-fi quality and the makeup being a little too much for some kids, try the British production of The Borrowers 1997, another worthwhile family children movie, also quite an adventure in itself. John Goodman is the nasty landlord in the tale of a young boy helping to save the plight of literally the 'little people.'

Hopefully, Robert Rodriguez will see from the success of this movie that more and more people are wanting to see well made family movies.  Someone needs to take the lead.The movie was very entertaining and can you believe it not one single curse word in the entire movie.  The closest they came to cussing was when Carmen said Holy Shitaki mushrooms.  There were enough special effects action scenes that it didn't need any violence.  Now don't get me wrong, I like action packed movies, but we need more action packed movies that are less violent.  If you thought it couldn't be done, this movie is proof that it can be done.This movie really had a great couple of messages.  The first message was that no matter who you are, you a have some quality in you that someone, someday will appreciate.  You don't have to be an action star to be someone's hero.  This was portrayed through Juno the younger brother of Carmen.  I especially liked how Carmen told her brother this, closer to the end of the movie.The main message this movie told was that Family is important.  We've had so many movies that show how families are expendable and if you don't like your family make another one.  Well the final moments of the movie said it all. The most important mission of all is Family and you have to work hard to keep it together.Robert Rodriguez, I salute you and even though I don't know if this movie will ever win an academy award, I feel that it has won a even higher award.

A great mix of fantasy, adventure, James Bondian gadgets, and kid-accessible characters and themes. Director Robert Rodriguez, best known for his ultra-violent films such as El Mariachi, Desperado, and From Dusk Til Dawn, crafts an well-paced, well-told, and highly enjoyable story. I easily sat through this film in the theater, pleased with its impressive production values, acting, story, special effects, and its sheer imagination. I was engaged and interested from the very beginning, as were my kids (4 and 6). I remain impressed by the clearly adult themes (and visuals) of the opening boy spy-meets-girl spy bedtime story, as we slowly realize that the story being told was that of the now boring, predictable, and thoroughly domesticated mom and dad. We've watched this film dozens of times since, and it's still easy to sit through, great fun for both me and the kids. The morals of the story are clear enough to any adult viewer the importance of family and family support, the importance of believing in yourself, and the importance of being open and honest. My 4-year-old son picked up clearly on all three messages, without any pointers from me. By the end of the film, everyone has matured in one way or another, every character has gained insight, and the family is closer than it ever was before. There are great supporting appearances by Cheech Marin and Robert Patrick (Terminator 2), although we sadly don't see enough of either. Alan Cumming as the fanciful and ultimately influential Floop is very enjoyable. Tony Shalhoub is great fun, as he is in any role, as the diabolical master manipulator, initially in the background who eventually becomes the ultimate bad guy, Alexander Minion. His best line, as he takes over I can assure you, it's MISTER Minion now. He gets his in the end, naturally, but it is not unpleasant or gory. It's actually quite comical, and he appears even to accept the final result/punishment he has brought upon himself. There are a number of other celebrity cameos here, including Teri Hatcher, Beavis and Butthead creator Mike Judge as Donnagon, George Clooney right at the end as Devlin, and a very stealthy Dick Clark as one of Floop's financiers. The story of the kids discovering that their parents are spies, having to strike out on their own with neither knowledge nor support, and then using their smarts and talents to take action to regain control of the situation and find their parents is plausible throughout, even when they're flying over the ocean and desert in personal jetpacks and mini-jet planes. We trace the kids from their home into the bad guy's lair, and the journey is easily believable and logical. The gadgets are a treat, from mini-jet planes to personal flying Buddy Pacs to homing devices, electrostatic gum, pinpoint video cameras, submarine minivans, instant McDonald microwave meals, and a totally cool Super Guppy submarine. The best part is that the kids get almost all of the gadgets, and they put them to instant good use defeating the bad guys. There are plenty of good comic bits to liven up the film as well, both jokes and sight gags. The kids act and talk like kids throughout, which adds to their plausibility of the film. The humor is both juvenile and adult, and presented in such a way as to keep the two separate, as they should be. There is no swearing, no blood or gore, no violence (some minor fighting), no gunplay or weapons, no nudity, and no drugs. Spy Kids is original, creative family fare, great for a video/DVD purchase and repeated viewings at home. The messages in the movie are strong and highly positive, yet subtle enough not to overshadow enjoyment of the story, its characters, and their adventures.

It has now been several years since I first heard of Spy Kids, but I was far from eager to watch it. I knew it was a kiddie spy flick, like Agent Cody Banks, and even though it's been several years since I last saw that 2003 release, I can still remember being put off by its cheesiness. I would probably still be ignoring this 2001 kiddie spy flick if it weren't for renowned cartoonist and filmmaker Mike Judge in the cast, as small as his role here is. This movie generally isn't considered atrocious, but I knew it would be at least somewhat cheesy, so I was not surprised by its overall mediocrity.Gregorio and Ingrid Cortez were once enemy spies from different countries, sent to kill each other, but when they met, they soon ended up falling in love, getting married, and semi-retiring from the spy business. Nine years later, they are now the parents of two children, Carmen and Juni, who are both unaware of their parents' past. The two Cortez parents return to their spy jobs after several other spies go missing, and it looks like a children's TV show called Floop's Fooglies could be responsible! They leave Uncle Felix Gumm with the kids and set out to investigate. The two secret agents are soon captured on their mission, and when this happens, an alarm goes off in the Cortez home and the place is invaded! Uncle Felix tells Carmen and Juni the truth, which is that their parents are spies and he is not really their uncle. The two young siblings manage to escape, and set out to work as spies themselves and save their parents! As well as being an action adventure film, this is also supposed to be a comedy, but absolutely nothing made me laugh, and I guess a couple parts made me smile, but hardly even did that! The Now flushing your poop part is an example of juvenile kiddie humour in the movie, and it's also certainly not amusing watching the conflict between the Cortez siblings, with the name calling and such. The story didn't really grab me for the most part, either. I found the first 25 minutes of the film or so to be consistently dull (including the part showing how two enemy spies just suddenly changed their minds when they met), and later, I did find SOME adrenaline in it, thanks to the action, but not enough to distract me from the flaws. I didn't really care much for any of the characters, and Alan Cumming's performance in the role of Fegan Floop is rather weak. I could tell that this character was supposed to be one of the more comical ones, but he just provides more failed attempts at humour for the already unfunny film. The special effects in Spy Kids are great, but special effects aren't everything.This 2001 kiddie spy flick apparently turned out to be a success, and was followed by Spy Kids 2 Island of Lost Dreams in 2002 and Spy Kids 3-D Game Over in 2003. After a long break, it appears the franchise is about to return with another sequel called Spy Kids 4 All the Time in the World coming up, one by Robert Rodriguez, just like the first three. However, I doubt I'll be watching any of these, as watching the original Spy Kids didn't capture my interest well enough. Now, maybe a 6/10 for this movie wouldn't be too much from me, due to the reasonably suspenseful parts (it may be a bit better than Agent Cody Banks), but in the end, it still left me with an underwhelming feeling. There's a good chance I would have liked this movie as a kid, but many adult viewers have also clearly enjoyed it. I won't say it's strictly for kids, but you should know what you're in for, and it's unsurprisingly a little cheesy.

At an early stage of getting to know them, I find the first, 2001, as the weakest with the last as the pinnacle. Except that they all contribute to a story that gradually gains strength, with the third as about escaping from a video game world run by the assorted faces of a god like creator, Sylvester Stallone.Background notes re the third, 2003, suggest that this was originally conceived as a separate story so it might be a trilogy by accident, but I find that it works.What is the centre of the series? For me it is the male director cum writer on one hand and Alexa Vega on the other. The flow from kid with a bedwetting problem through activist against an errant male to an age 15 who can sing way too loud on a stage, supported by fluent electric musicians. I find this viewpoint to link this series rather neatly with Sleepover (2004). Also with Alexa's earlier appearance in Nine Months.Accept something like that as a centre, then her screen brother's impressive approach to girls in the series seems a natural follow on, with that linked to how his other attributes are shown.It would be natural to consider these primarily as adventure SF stories but I prefer to consider such as just a fun sort of setting and packaging for this other side. Either could be true. Background notes re the third do show the director writer as a family man who likes to be involved with his kids, play having kids fantasy content? It is not unusual for SF to be a format for considering real world issues. I put this as low budget forays into the worlds of Harry Potter and Northern Lights.That sort of viewpoint comes from watching the trilogy and trying to think things through. Then I listened to the Spy Kids 2 commentary re the music and stuff and smiled.

Accident or no, `Spy Kids' is one of the best family films to come around in years.  I hate to sound like every other critic in town, but it's impossible to describe `Spy Kids' without mentioning `Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory.'  With this film, Rodriguez has looked past his previous genre in favor of a colorful, insane film that focuses on the virtues of family values and an active imagination.Banderas  and Carla Gugino star as Gregorio and Ingrid Cortez, two exemplary intelligence agents (though we never really find out who they're working for) who have given up their dangerous missions in order to raise their children, Juni (Darly Sabara) and Carmen (Alexa Vega).  Gregorio and Ingrid have been relatively successful in keeping their children in the dark regarding their true occupations until they accept a risky, yet simple mission To find several intelligence agents who have mysteriously disappeared.Before we know it, Gregorio and Ingrid have been kidnapped by Fegan Floop (Cumming), the eccentric kids' TV show host, who plans to aid the world's takeover with a child robot army. Come on. You know it sounds like fun.Surprisingly, `Spy Kids' is spun off from Rodriguez' segment of the Quentin Tarantino film `Four Rooms.'  Apparently, this film was Rodriguez' brainchild from the beginning;  not only did he direct the film, he produced it, wrote the screenplay, composed a good portion of the music, worked extensively on the visual effects, and did all the editing.  Are you impressed yet?How about the fact that he made a feature length, visual effects-heavy film with a prominent cast for only $36 million?  Keep in mind that the Hollywood average is $45 million, and that the cost for a film this heavy in computer graphics and visual effects is usually upwards of $100 million.  How this was done is beyond me.  The sets and costumes were the best I've seen in some time, reminiscent of `Willy Wonka' and, oddly enough, `The Flintstones.'The most entertaining aspect for me, however, was seeing Rodriguez' ardently distinctive directorial style (along with his trademark Spanish classical guitar music) employed in a film that is, above all else, for kids.  The use of slow motion, distance zooms, and strobing camera angles, not to mention the jerky, quick camera movements during pivotal action scenes seemed just as comfortable here as they did in `Desperado.'True to form, Rodriguez gives the film a healthy dose of his personal culture, and does a great job of presenting the film's Latino theme as a standard rather than a statement.  Aside from Banderas and the wonderfully over-the-top Cumming, the star-studded cast includes the likes of Robert Patrick and Teri Hatcher, and features cameos by George Clooney and Cheech Marin.  With all this starpower, however, it's easy to overlook the real stars of `Spy Kids'- the kids themselves.Corny?  Yeah.  Goofy and mindless?  Of course.  But it's a LOT of fun.  It presents the fantasy landscape, and expects us to believe it and get involved in the story.  I'm gonna give this one a `B+.' If you're below the age of 12 or a Rodriguez fan, it's a must-see.

Starring Antonio Banderas, Carla Gugino, Alexa Vega, Daryl Sabara, Alan Cumming.  Directed by Robert Rodriguez     While retaining all the characteristics of a conventional action flick &#145; Spy Kids' will appeal to both adults and children alike. From its' opening sequence displaying its' rough, taut adventurous look to the subtle transition to our child heroes, this film is incredibly well done and is quite surprising.      Now before we get ahead of ourselves and condone it as being a truly great film &#150; it is not. Yet, my biggest revelation is that Director Robert Rodriguez has been known for lower caliber affairs such as &#145;Desperado',  &#145;The Faculty' and &#145;From Dusk &#145;Til Dawn'. These films to say the least have been violent opuses that have exposed us to one graphic side of Rodriguez. Here it is no secret that he is making a film that his children can actually watch &#150; and furthermore enjoy.       Antonio Banderas and Carla Gugino who receive top billing in the film are cast aside as Daryl Sabara (Juni) and Alexa Vega (Carmen) set out to rescue their kidnapped parents. Apparently, their parents were also spies but since having children, they seemingly have lost their skills and thus setting the plot for a full-blown rescue attempt. Here the context allows these children to utilize rocket packs, beat up on living, walking thumb people  (do not ask) and use incredible gadgets that have all passed through a blue screen.       The delicious Alan Cumming (Titus, Josie and the Pussycats) who is fantastic even in the weakest of characterizations is great as a TV children's show host who is bent on eliminating all spies. The great Tony Shalhoub (The Siege, Big Night) also joins him as his Minion named Minion.     It is apparent that Rodriguez has seen his share of children's fare and that he has done his research when it comes to the children's department. This is a cute little family film that is packed with gadgetry and special effects. It seems that almost every scene passed through some sort of digital imagery processing, resulting in this film containing a lot of eye candy.      To say the least it is well made. And while the holes in this film are pervasive and many, it does not set out to be a masterpiece, but more so a family film that can bring families all together. Need proof? Witness the last line of the film uttered by Alexa Vega's Carmen character. While speaking to their superior, the self mocking George Clooney in a cameo resulting in a successful attempt at leaving a sequel open she states &#145;Spy Work- that's easy. Keeping a family together, that's the difficult part.  And that is the mission worth fighting for'.Giancarlo's Rating **   "},{"Title":"Nice idea, not so great implementation","Date":"22 September 2001","Score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Adventure, Comedy","Review":"  Spy Kids takes a neat idea and unfortunately turns it into a pretty mediocre film. The concept, of kids finding out their parents are spies, and then rescuing them with high tech gadgetry, is great. In this case, however, the execution leaves a lot to be desired. The problem isn't with the cast, which is pretty good all around, but with the direction and plotting. In the Bond films, or the Mission Impossible series, or even True Lies (of which this is something like a children's version), there is at least a surface attempt to keep things within some bounds of what-might-pass-for-reality. But here, you have what one previous reviewer appropriately described as Bond-meets-Willy Wonka-meets-Tim Burton. And that just doesn't work.The child actors (especially Alexa Vega) are quite good, Banderas turns in a solid performance, and Carla Gugino is great. But what could have been every kid's dream (finding out your parents are spies and playing with their cool toys) turns into an unfulfilling mishmash of computer-generated fantasy (which usually looks cheesy), ridiculous plotting, and some really disturbing stuff for kids.The moral is good, the Latino casting is good, the concept is good, and there are probably eight or ten GREAT little one-liners or sight gags scattered throughout, but all in all I really can't give this more than a five.Whether or not I'll come back for the sequel depends a lot on what I hear by word of mouth. If Roberto can do a kid-friendly version of True Lies, I'll definitely see it. But if he goes back to morphing Teletubbies and Burtonesque weirdness, I'll have to pass.

One of Carmen's favourite stories involves two spies sent from different countries to kill the other who met and fell in love.  What the kids don't know is that the story is true, and the characters are them.  We learn later on that Carmen wears diapers at night and Juni is easily frightened and sweats enough to make warts on his hands. One of his favourite shows is Fegan Floop, in which the children's television host lives in a castle with several strange creatures.  And recently, several of Gregorio's old colleagues have vanished, and every time they go missing, a new character pops up on the show.  In reality, Floop is a villain accompanied by mad scientist Alexander Minion, who has built several world leader's children-lookalike robots to help him take over the world.  Floop is secretly more interested in finding the missing ingredient for his show.  And when the Cortez couple get kidnapped, their children must save them and the world, with the help of gadgets made by their uncle, Machete, who hates his little brother, their father.In this film, Antonio Banderas (The Mask of Zorro), Danny Trejo (Con Air), and Cheech Marin (of the Cheech and Chong films) appear together in a film once again (they were all previously in Desperado and will later appear in Once Upon a Time In Mexico).  Trejo cameos as Machete, Gregorio's hateful older brother, and Cheech Marin CAMEOS (strong emphasis) as Felix Gumm, a spy posing as their uncle who has been protecting them for years.  He only appears in about three scenes, I believe.  Carla Gugino plays Ingrid, who is a refreshing change from the tyoical idiot mom.  She and Banderas do well together.Robert Rodriguez tries his hand at making a children's action-adventure flick (and does better then he did in From Dusk til Dawn, ironically every film in which Banderas, Tujo and Marin appear in is done by him), and as unchallenging as writing a script for that audience is, he doesn't do bad entertaining adults.  The opening sequence depicting Gregorio and Ingrid's meeting is well done and exciting.  The special effects are fairly poor, and unfortunatley exagurated on. The characters are generally rather flat, but Floop is interestingly expirimented with as a Willy-Wonka type villian with a soft spot for kids.The subplot about transforming spies into Teletubbie-like creatures is ridiculous, to be sure, but hey, IT'S FOR KIDS.  And the Virtual Room isn't too original, nor is the Third Brain.  Alan Cumming (Boris in Goldeneye)'s potrayl of Floops raised a smile, in obvious reference to today's entertainers.  Tony Shalhoub's character of Minion was a little too cliched.  And of course the brilliant children are played as superior to the adults.I did like the clever spoofs of the James Bond gadgetry.  And Trejo did do a good job at Machete, if his character was a bit inconsistent and underused. His lines were good (We're just brothers.  Cain and Abel were brothers, and look what happened to them.) and the subplot about his relationship with Gregorio will help kids realize why they should love their younger siblings. The acting from the kids was either wood (Carmen) or overracted (Juni) but I think I was wise not to take the film seriously.  The mimicing thing was over the top,  but hey, it's for kids.Unfortunately, I'm afraid it's time to be mean.  The thumb-ninjas made NO sense, are they robots or spies or what?  Some of the parodies are witty, but some of it was just plain annoying (ie the kids leaving the store in tuxedos and shades), the kids sitting behind me yelling Whoa, holy! when Carmen found the international cash, and Carmen saying Oh, shitake mushrooms!  That annoyed me a LOT.Your kids will love it.  Leave your brain at the door.  Don't take it seriously.  It isn't bad, just short and a nice, if somewhat irritating distraction.

It's refreshing! I agree with a previous post, the Latino flavor was definitely a relief compared to the everyday white-bred movies out there. Being Hispanic, I like the fact that this is not necessarily a movie about Latinos. This is a movie about a family - who just happens to be Latino. It doesn't try to exploit the stereotype like other movies do (i.e. 'The Mexican' ugh!), and gives it that touch of flavor most movies don't have. By adding this Latin twist and bright imagination, we get a nice and unexpected treat.

But the essential message doesn't seem to be parodied - the narrative concerns all those favourites in the pro-family genre the father who has to prove himself worthy of his kids; the kids who have to come out of their shells; the realisation that lies and assumed roles are probably not very healthy in a family context; children should follow in the footsteps of their parents, asserting tradition; children's TV is not a good substitute for family contact and communication.From the beginning, the spy antics are conceived as an allegory for family values - the parents' marriage is conceived and disrupted by their careers in espionage; the main narrative concerns the kids' attempts to rescue their parents and restore the home; the denouement is the scene for a family reunion.  There is even a juvenile Oedipal story, where the son manages to surpass a father he was always embarrassed by.There's nothing inherently wrong with this.  Rodriguez wrote, directed and produced the film, so we may assume it's a theme close to his heart.  For all its CGI modernity, the film's movement actually resembles those old live action Disney films about kids-in-peril (e.g. 'In search of castaways'), crossed with the old-fashioned, fetishised gadgetry and outre sets of Supermarionation; spliced, of course, with the more late-20th century likes of 'Star Wars', 'The Matrix', 'Mission Impossible 2' etc., and, hearteningly, the queasy colour schemes and various plot points from 'The City of Lost Children', which might be this film's dark double.As in 'The Matrix', there are some pop-metaphysical pretensions, such as the scene where our heroes fight their evil doppelgangers, but this is part of the conservative message the rupture of the family unit entails a breakdown in identity (see also the transformation of dad into a grotesque puppet thing).In any event, we are free to ignore the message, and enjoy the film's surface (certainly, Rodriguez could argue that his message is explicitely framed as a fantasy, a bedtime story, unrealisable in the real world; that would make the tone sarcastic and in bad faith).  This is underwhelming.Too often the bold flourishes betray their CGI joins, and become the digital equivalent of those back projections in Hitchcock movies. Rodriguez admirably wants to create a world of pure 60s bubblegum artifice, but the fact of 'real' actors force logistical compromises that aren't always pretty.This leaves the story.  The script and characters are too thin, and the action too abrupt, for us to engage in their trauma.  Like the usual Rodriguez film, the narrative is pretty much non-stop action, but because this is a kid's movie, the sanitised, cartoon action prohibits the usual Rodriguez tension between the ugliness of the violence and the beauty of its choreography.  The sets are strange, colourful, but somehow lack inventive vividness.  A Tim Burton would have accessed the story's dark centre; Rodriguez, however, provides an interesting subtext about the lingering racism suffered by the Hispanic children at their WASP school as the basis for their unhappiness.

Mind you both DESPARADO and FROM DUSK TILL DAWN were both rightly awarded 18 certificates while THE FACULTY was a 15 cert and SPY KIDS is a U certificate so despite having a similar style his movies are targetted to widely different audiencesAs I said SPY KIDS is very much a live action comic strip with two kids , Carmen and Juni , trying to rescue their parents from a evil TV host played by Alan Cummings . The movie does have a problem and that`s that the plot is wafer thin and in many places the plot seems to have gone AWOL all together as the film descends into a series of set pieces almost always involving a chase sequence , but to give it credit SPY KIDS never takes itself seriously so therefore never comes across as patronizing which is a nice antidote to the hidously over hyped Harry Potter movie which came out a couple of months later   "}]
