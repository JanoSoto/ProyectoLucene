Oscar winner Whoopi Goldberg (Ghost) does a good preformance and Haley Joel Osment, future Oscar nominee (The Sixth Sense) was also really good. And whoever played Bogus, Gerand .... was also really good and I find him funny and would like to know more about him cause he's got talent and I bet he knows it!

The people he was closest to in his former life were the French magician and his wife/partner. Therefore it made sense that his imaginary friend was like them.  I loved the movie and though Harriet seemed to change suddenly in some people's opinion, I think she was changing throughout the movie.  The looks she gave and the thoughts that seemed to be going through her mind, were very evident of that fact. GÃ©rard Depardieu was excellent in the part of Bogus, the evidence between him being so big and the boy so small.  How many times have we as adults wished for someone big and strong to take us up and give us comfort?  I loved the ending where he wandered away to help another child. Sometimes in my life, I wish for someone like him. He also has a lovely smile.  Good movie for that time when you are wanting something different.

It's not just a fantasy.  It's a performance by magician Antoine in Las Vegas.  Lorraine, one of the performers, has a 7-year-old son named Albert who wants to be a magician.  The boy's father must have been a magician, someone says, because he disappeared.After Lorraine dies tragically, there is no family to take care of him.  Lorraine's co-workers think of Albert as family, but they travel too much (wonder why Lorraine didn't, or if she did).  It is determined that Lorraine wanted Harriet Franklin to have Albert if anything happened. A flashback shows how Harriet, a little black girl, arrived at the foster home where Lorraine already lived.  The two became friends, although this is not shown.  When Harriet, the owner of a restaurant supply business, is contacted, she gets upset.  No, she doesn't want a child!  (The usual reaction from a Whoopi Goldberg character)  But Harriet remembers how good a friend Lorraine was and reluctantly agrees to take Albert.Harriet lives in Newark (the only thing good about Newark is that it is close to Atlantic City, where Albert's friends will soon perform), so Albert must take a plane ride.  On the plane, Albert is given a coloring book, and one of the characters in the coloring book comes to life.  He is a French man who calls himself Bogus who only Albert can see or hear.  Throughout the movie, people wonder who Albert is talking to.  But it seems Bogus is his only friend. Harriet doesn't want him, and he doesn't bond with the other children.  An example  in one scene, a magician is performing at a child's birthday party, and Albert knows how the trick was done, but when another child is scared, Albert doesn't reassure her.  He just wonders silently how kids could be so dumb.  Albert doesn't try very hard to be happy with his situation, while Harriet goes out of her way to help the boy and doesn't seem to be getting any reward.  Just lots of parking tickets. Even though Bogus is from a fantasy world, he tries to give Albert practical advice.  He knows Albert needs to face his problems and get on with life, but he still wants to have fun with the boy.  There are a couple of enjoyable scenes with Bogus and Albert together, one with Jack Sheldon of 'Schoolhouse Rock' fame singing 'Me and My Shadow' as the two friends explore Newark.  In another scene, an ice cream parlor magically appears in a warehouse.  Harriet and her business associate Bob can't see the ice cream, though Bob pretends to.  (Is something going on with those two other than business?) Whoopi Goldberg gives her usual performance.  She has an attitude but tries to be civil to the boy and eventually shows signs of coming around.  Gerard Depardieu is wonderful as Bogus.  And while this is no 'Sixth Sense', Haley Joel Osment is still one of the best possible actors to play his role.  It's a shame he will have to grow up.This is a formula movie, but I like the formula.Possible Spoiler  Eventually, Harriet does see and hear Bogus, and she even dances with him to big band and polka music, with both wearing fancy costumes that come out of nowhere.

Only Whoopi Goldberg finds herself at the disadvantage of a character which requires her to be singlemindedly unsympathetic until a sudden (and, frankly, unconvincing) epiphany near the end).The casting leans towards the bizarre, the point where Goldberg starts to be able to see Osment's imaginary friend is implausible enough to up the bizarreness quotient noticeably, and the full-on Fred and Ginger dance routine delivered by Goldberg and Depardieu, while very nearly worth the admission price in its own right, is (let's be honest here) full-throttle bizarreness made flesh.An interesting experiment - not wholly successful, but with enough good points to make it worth a watch.

Her will stipulates that Albert be placed in the custody of his mom's little-known half-sister, Harriet (Whoopi Goldberg), a New Jersey restaurant-supply owner who's anything but motherly. That's when Albert invents Bogus (Gerard Depardieu), an imaginary friend who springs to life from a coloring book drawing--clearly the product of Albert's need for love and companionship. It's easy to see why director Norman Jewison was drawn to the challenge of this delicate, charmingly cast fantasy/drama whimsically written by Alvin Sargent (OscarÂ®-winner for Ordinary People), and there are some lovely moments that capture a fleeting sense of wonder. But like the similar fantasy Three Wishes, the magic is lightweight and it doesn't always work. Your best bet is to just surrender to the sentiment, and don't be surprised if you shed a tear or two.

He is fun and listens to him. This bewilders Goldberg who questions the boy's behavior after strange occurrences. Bogus is obviously there to unite the two. Not so much about imaginary friends as it is about recovering from loss but for something advertised as a comedy it plainly isn't very funny. Director Norman Jewison used these elements before in Moonstruck and Only You with fine visual elements. Goldberg holds her own in the role of caregiver unable or unwilling to participate but as formulas go she will let down her guard.

Haley Joel Osment as Albert is the best casting, coping with loss using imagination and adapting to Goldberg. Nancy Travis plays his mother with an interesting back story but untimely death.

A violent death of a character (Nancy Travis') after a repoire has been established with her and the audience is not the way to start a film. For the sake of discretion and to eliminate cheap sensationalism, the film should have begun after the child's (Albert's) mother had already died. Then, he should have been surrounded by supportive adults who truly try to understand and nourish his spirit. Instead, we literally get a bunch of clowns.I rooted for Albert when he ran from the funeral proceedings to regard the symbolism of the dove, aloft and soaring. I rooted for him, also, when he was being led to the plane to Newark (sic) and refused to even look back, let alone wave, to his cheering, selfish, betraying acquaintances.Having come from a foster family, herself, Whoopi Goldberg's character (Harriet Franklin) should have been much more empathetic, and even eager, to share some of the success, knowledge and wisdom that she had acquired in life from her childhood situation, saving the child from years, possibly, of state sponsorship and additional trauma.Instead, hers is a single-dimensional character that could have been played by anyone. Her disregard and terrorizing of the traumatized child at the airport is inexcuseable. The lines written for Depardieu are formulaic and uninspiring. His appearance, role and goals in Albert's life are not explained, even a little bit. The people we care for most in Bogus are the ones who are most maligned and abused; Albert and his mother. The selfish, callous robots in the film are given free reign. The fact that Albert is dominated, neglected and abused in the film speaks a great deal about the heart of the screenwriters (Jeff Rothberg and Francis X. McCarthy) and their opinion of children. The racist behavior by Harriet while on the phone with the lawyer should have been scrapped. The bathroom scene with Albert and Depardieu was too risquÃ© and should have been eliminated. The movie needed to be re-written by someone with heart, intelligence, depth and writing skill. Whoopi Goldberg is fully, maybe even eminently, capable of playing a part of great depth, wisdom, courage and love, yet they made her just another businessperson clone.Gepardieu should have been a real character (perhaps, co-incidentally, a wise-street magician) that Albert and Harriet meet in the park in Newark, becoming a mentor to Albert and deep, close friend to Harriet. This would have made this a truly enchanting and valuable movie. With these allies, the pain of Albert's loss could have been superseded, and his creativity, bravery and self-esteem given loft and wings, like the dove at his mother's grave.

He can't get along in the real world without his mother, so he creates an imaginary friend(Gerard Depardeu, a very odd casting choice) named Bogus, who is basically used as an escape. It sounds odd, but what subjects relating to imaginary pals aren't? I will give it much credit for being a whole lot better than the grating, loathsome, Drop Dead Fred, which presents a similar subject, but I didn't exactly love it. Osmett's character is a huge brat who fails to see the good around him, but does is so obnoxious about it that it's hard to feel sorry for him, even though we(the audience) are probably supposed to. His character is sort of generic and could have been played by any young boy. I imagine a lot of people could have pulled off Goldberg's and Travis's roles as well, since there was really nothing to them, but to give them credit, they weren't that bad. Gerard Depardeu, on the other hand, as a child's imaginary friend is just strage, but I guess he was okay. The story just wasn't my favorite and I didn't get the conclusion.

It's so nauseating it'll turn even the strongest stomach.A bogus movie?  Definitely!  In fact, to borrow the quote from most critical reviews of The Stupids, Well at least they can't be accused of false advertising!

All the boy wanted, when his mother died, was to carry on her dream, and become a circus magician, but that didn't come to be, hardly a happy ending then. It's an ok movie, with a few really funny lines.

Osment makes his film debut in this tale about a little boy (Osment) whose mother (Nancy Travis) dies. He is then sent to live with his grumpy foster aunt (Whoopi Goldberg). In an effort to ease the pain, Osment frequently has contact with his imaginary friend, Bogus (Gerard Depardieu). It's a mystery how and even why Goldberg and Depardieu agreed to portray such wooden roles. All of the film's attempts at being even remotely pleasant fail and the film often winds up being more sad than funny leading to some misleading advertising.    "},{"Title":"Horrible movie, horrible cast","Date":"26 August 2003","Score":"","Genre":"Comedy, Family, Fantasy","Review":"  Bogus is seriously one of the worst movies I've ever seen.  Whoopi Goldberg once again proves to be one of the poorest actresses of our time. The dialogue between her and Gerard Depardieu (who also can't act) attempts to be witty and funny, but it just sounds like contrived garbage.  Please do yourself a favor and avoid the movie Bogus.  Luckily, I'm sure that most people did, otherwise I'd hear more complaining about what a horrible movie it is. "}]
