But I must say how disappointed I was with this adaptation. William Hurt was a poor Rochester indeed. He had a very wooden and unemotional presence throughout the film. His scenes with the Jane Eyre character had no fire or emotion at all. He seemed very detached and aloof. If William Hurt was younger he would have played a better St. John. However, I must say Charlotte Gainsborough was a pretty good Jane Eyre. She looked the part and added very charming persona to the character. But she even, at times seemed cool and unattatched to me too. The worst element to this film was casting Elle McPherson as the role of Blanche. Why? Blanche Ingram was beautiful, true, but she was beautiful in the Victorian sense of the word, not a 90's waif snatched from a Parisian runway. Sheesh. The best element to this film, however was the sequences of young Jane and Helen at Lowood. Anna Paquin was amazing as she embodied the young Jane to near perfection. These early, well done scenes where the best in the entire movie but I regret to say they lead me down the primrose path to disappointment.

I was deeply disappointed to find that this movie, which seemed to be either written or filmed in great haste, had not the qualities that made the original novel so powerful.  Much of the witty back and forth between the main characters, Jane Eyre and Mr. Rochester, seemed to be either missing from the screenplay or left on the cutting room floor.  Also missing was Jane Eyre's charismatic sense of self, which enabled her to suffer through her turmoil and triumph over all.  The original Jane Eyre was a hero.  The woman in this movie did not seem to have much to triumph over, including one of the greatest parts of the story when Jane runs away from Thornfield and Mr. Rochester.  Her struggle to find food and shelter, her shame at having to beg for bread, the threat of freezing to death in the cold, all to get away from a man she loved were, in my opinion, poignant parts of the story that were simply left out of this movie.  The title character seemed dry and uninspired.  The story was unappealing and for those who did not read the book, I cannot imagine that this story would be the least bit interesting.  The screenplay and Direction did little if any credit to the classic story.

He is a wonderful actor, but it's as if this part was not suited to him. Mr. Rochester is a man of passion, pain, and jealousy; none of which were reflected in this story. The story is great, the actors are great, but story and actors are mismatched in this film. Another disservice is the failure of the movie to maintain the integrity of the book. Jane leaves Thornefield twice; once on the death of her aunt, and once again when left at the alter. In Bronte's book, Jane's travels and subsequent proposal of marriage after being left at the alter are somewhat cumbersome, but necessary to support her final return to Rochester, being willing to be with him under any terms. Unfortunately, these adventures are apparently difficult to incorporate into a film. Charlotte Gainsbourg's performance is the only one I've seen, and I'm anxious to follow her career.

This adaptation filmed by Franco Zeffirelli seems to me the most individual one. The director does not copy the book but entails his personal feelings and evaluations to the strange fate of Jane Eyre throughout the movie.The film is made wonderfully the cast, the music, the entire convention - It supplies the viewer with the right picture of the Victorian England. I particularly liked the scenes shot at Haddon Hall with William Hurt. He shines in his role! GREAT ACTOR! He memorably stresses Rochester's goodness combined with his boredom and fear of love, caused by his tragic life experience.The sense of suspicion is also felt throughout. Jane (Charlotte Gainsbourg) comes to Mr Rochester's castle and hears strange laughter. It is much later when it occurs that it was Rochester's insane wife (Maria Schneider).The way love is showed is very Zeffirellian. He loves to show delicate love that is raising in time. There is a feeling on both sides, but it is Rochester who tries to show it first, especially because he considers Jane an angel of happiness that appeared in his tragic life. Jane is more shy but her way of dealing with Rochester changes, too.The Zeffirelian way of showing love is also expressed when applied to friendship. Consider how Franco Zeffirelli shows the friendship between Helen Burns (Leanne Rowe) and Jane Eyre (Anna Paquin). One of the most touching moments of the movie is when Helen Burns dies and tells Jane that God cares for us. She was the girl that could notice everyone, even the orphan who was let down and terribly ignored by pious and pure victorian teachers. Faith, open eyes connected with love and open heart is what Zeffirelli loved to show in most of his films.The music is one of the best from the films I have seen so far. It's very moody but supplies the viewer with wonderful, sometimes even mystical experience. For long after seeing the film for the first time, the music, somehow unconsciously, rang in my ears. Really worth attention!Maybe some people will treat my opinion with some irony but I must say that Zeffirelli's JANE EYRE can be watched many times and each time one can discover something new, something valuable, teaching, and moving. TOUCHED INTO TEARS! That's what I feel whenever I watch this incredible film.

The lead actors are woefully miscast, clearly hired for their star names, and the musical score drippy and dull. Charlotte Gainsbourg and William Hurt have absolutely no chemistry with one another at all. She is like a wet noodle, worse even than Joan Fontaine, who at least was capable of some modicum of emotional involvement in what should be a story of frustrated passion. And William Hurt acts the entire film on one tone and that tone is flat and devoid of energy. Of course the limp and vapid script does not aid any of these otherwise fine actors in their efforts to bring any whiff of life to this flick.Joan Plowright's Mrs Fairfax is like some Disney creation who keeps popping up to sweeten scenes in which she would have been best left out. There is no mystery surrounding the story of Rochester's first wife. The role of the would-be second wife, played like a Barbie Doll by Elle MacPhearson, is an empty cipher.Fiona Shaw, a very great actress, is completely wasted as Jane's Aunt, Mrs Reed. She would have been better-cast as Mrs Fairfax. Only Amanda Root, as Jane's beloved school teacher, evokes any authentic sympathy or believability. I saw this version of 'Jane Eyre' after viewing Robert Young's for British television, made in 1997, starring Ciaran Hinds, Samantha Morgan and Gemma Jones. There is no comparison. Young's vital, romantic and deeply moving version is like an exploding nova compared to Zefferelli's wet squib.I will be interested now to see the 1970 version with Timothy Dalton, about which I've read some very good things on this web-site. I am amazed at how many people liked Zefferelli's Yorkshire picture book. About all I can say good about this film is that the house is beautiful and the cinematography vividly colored, beyond that it is a complete dud.

I feel this film in no way reflects the brilliance of Bronte's work, and rather gave the impression of a shallow love story. In the condensing of the film to a short 2hours, the film lost many of the key features which make the book comprehendable and progressional, thus resulting in a somewhat jumpy plot with little grounding.  There is no build up to the romance between Rochester and Jane Eyre, so this appears rather abrupt and unfounded since the two characters have such infrequent interaction you cannot help but imagine their 'love' is superficial. This is such an injustice to Bronte's novel;you are given no impression of Jane's quirky cheek and boldness which attracts Rochester to her, and his arrogance which attracts Jane to him.Despite to poor scripting, I think that a few of the characters were portrayed very astutely, namely Mrs Fairfax and Grace Poole, however overall the production was poor.  Given a better scripting, perhaps the film would have been more successful.  See Jane Eyre (1970) with Zelah Clarke and Timothy Dalton for an outstanding production.

Jane Eyres live or die according to their Rochesters, and this one is NOT worthy of the source material. I generally like Hurt, but he could not be more wrong for this role.

After all, this was the man who brought us Romeo&Juliet!  Therefore, I expected nothing but excellence.  How wrong I was!  This was a terrible adaptation!  Why, you ask?  Several reasons. #1 Really BAD writing.  Charlotte Bronte would have been abhorred at what they've done!  The writer took out all the most important scenes between Jane and Rochester, leaving audiences very little understanding of the passionate love that they have for each other.   #2  Not enough time.

However, Charlotte Gainesburg and William Hurt are wrongly casted.  Appearance wise, they are right as Jane and Rochester but the chemistry was just not there and chemistry is very important.  I felt both were very stiff in delivering their lines, especially in their scenes together.  Where is the sizzle, the passion?  In order to convey a successful story of Jane Eyre, you must first have passion between the two leads.  This is not just merely any love story, this is a love story between two very passionate people.  This is also a story about sexual attraction, so how can the movie lack passion. However, with all the bad there are some good.  The scenery and mood was very well done.  Zefferili got the dreary and Bronte feel of the Victorian Era perfectly.

So much of the novel had been left out and I considered William Hurt to be terribly miscast as Rochester. Since then I have watched all the other noteworthy adaptations of the novel, the three short versions of '44, '70 and '97 and the three mini series of '73, '83 and 2006, and I have noticed that there are worse adaptations and worse Rochesters.This is without doubt the most exquisite Jane Eyre adaptation as far as cinematography is concerned. Director Franco Zerifferelli revels in beautiful long shots of snow falling from a winter sky, of lonely Rochester standing on a rock, and of Jane looking out of the window - but he is less good at telling a story and bringing characters to life. In addition, his script merely scratches the surface of the novel by leaving out many important scenes. As a consequence the film does not show the depth and complexity of the relationship between Jane and Rochester, and sadly it does also not include the humorous side of their intercourse. There are a number of short conversations between Rochester and Jane, each of them beautifully staged, but the couple of sentences they exchange do not suffice to show the audience that they are drawn to each other. We know that they are supposed to fall in love, but we never see it actually happen. The scene in which Rochester wants to find out Jane's reaction to his dilemma by putting his case in hypothetical form before her after the wounded Mason has left the house is completely missing, and the farewell scene, the most important scene - the climax - of the novel is reduced to four sentences. Zerifferelli does not make the mistake other scriptwriters have made in substituting their own poor writing for BrontÃ«'s superb lines, neither are crucial scenes completely changed and rewritten, but he makes the less offensive but in the end similarly great mistake of simply leaving many important scenes out. What remains is just a glimpse of the novel, which does no justice to Charlotte BrontÃ«'s masterpiece.The cast is a mixed bag While Fiona Shaw is an excellent Mrs Reed, Anna Paquin's young Jane is more an ill-mannered, pout Lolita than a lonely little girl, longing for love. The ever-reliable Joan Plowright makes a very likable, but far too shrewd Mrs Fairfaix, and one cannot help feeling that Billie Whitelaw is supposed to play the village witch instead of plain-looking, hard-working Grace Poole. Charlotte Gainsbourgh as the grown-up heroine, however, is physically a perfect choice for playing Jane Eyre. Looking every bit like 18, thin and frail, with irregular, strong features, she comes closest to my inner vision of Jane than any other actress in that role. And during the first 15 minutes of her screen time I was enchanted by her performance. Gainsbourgh manages well to let the audience guess at the inner fire and the strong will which are hidden behind the stoic mask. But unfortunately the script never allows her to expand the more passionate and lively side of Jane's character any further. As a result of leaving out so many scenes and shortening so much of the dialogues, Gainsbourgh's portrayal of Jane must necessarily remain incomplete and therefore ultimately unsatisfactory. This is a pity, as with a better script Charlotte Gainsbourgh might have been as good a Jane as Zelah Clarke in the '83 version.But while it is still obvious that Gainsbourgh is trying to play Jane, there is no trace whatsoever of Rochester in the character that William Hurt portrays. Hurt, who has proved himself to be a fine actor in many good movies, must have been aware that he was physically and type-wise so miscast that he did not even attempt at playing the Rochester of the novel. His Rochester, besides being blond and blue-eyed, is a soft-spoken, well-mannered nobleman, shy and quiet, slightly queer and eccentric, but basically good-natured and mild. He is so far from being irascible, moody and grim that lines referring to these traits of his character sound absolutely ridiculous. Additionally, during many moments of the movie, Hurt's facial expression leaves one wondering if he is fighting against acute attacks of the sleeping sickness. Particularly in the proposal scene he grimaces like a patient rallying from a general anaesthetic and is hardly able to keep his eyes open. If you compare his Rochester to the strong-willed and charming protagonist of the novel, simply bursting with energy and temperament, it is no wonder that many viewers are disappointed in Hurt's performance. Still, he offends me less than the Rochesters in the '70, '97 and 2006 versions and I would in general rank this Jane Eyre higher than these three other ones. Hurt obviously had the wits to recognise that he could not be the Rochester of the novel and therefore did not try to do so, whereas George C. Scott, CiarÃ n Hinds and Toby Stephens thought they could, but failed miserably, and I'd rather watch a character other than Rochester than a Rochester who is badly played. And I'd rather watch a Jane Eyre movie which leaves out many lines of the novel but does not invent new ones than a version which uses modernised dialogues which sound as if they could be uttered by a today's couple in a Starbucks cafÃ©. Of course this Jane Eyre is a failure, but at least it is an inoffensive one, which is more than one can say of the '97 and 2006 adaptations. I would therefore not desist anyone from watching this adaptation You will not find Jane Eyre, but at least you will find a beautifully made movie.

It seems to be that the passion (or love, whatever you would like to call it) between Jane and Mr Rochester is much more subtle in the book, whereas in the movie, it is pretty obvious that she is attracted to him and that he will ask her to marry him. Also, with all the changes they made to the ending, it just doesn't seem quite right, as if it has lost that touch of magic that made the book so special. However, this movie is not all bad, and yes- it does have its good points. I really enjoyed the subtle implications of darkness and mystery within the house- Mr Mason and the role he played and what his actions caused.I just wish that they didn't change too much of the plot, that's all.

He did so with such finesse that he helped to make the girl who played Jane seem to be better suited to the role than she was.(That garden scene when he proposes is done so well and seemed so real-it takes a terrific actor to really pull that off as well as he did.)

The story was largely rushed and truncated- especially the ending. I know things have to be cut to fit it into such a short time frame (less than two hours) but I feel it was just handled clumsily. The first two thirds of the movie were just mediocre, nothing to write home about, but the last part was just a mess. The acting was nothing special either. Those who were good were wasted in their too-small roles. Those who were featured more were not very good. The two words that appear most in my notes are flat and emotionless. It was an all around disappointment, devoid of all of the passion and fire of the book.Fiona Shaw was very good, but was entirely wasted as Mrs. Reed, in her very limited screen time. Gateshead was way too rushed. Anna Paquin is very good as Jane, but the character is even more feisty than in the book. Even though she was near 25, Charlotte Gainsbourg did look the right age for Jane and they did a pretty good job making her look plain. She was way too tall though (with an very long neck) and although she had everything to make a good Jane, she was pretty dull actually. She was even more reserved and quiet than the book Jane, which, given how passionate her younger self was in this, was especially jarring.If I thought Gainsbourg's Jane was lackluster, that was nothing compared to William Hurt's Rochester. My original feelings on him were block of wood and my opinion remains unchanged upon the latest viewing. My above mentioned flat and emotionless apply to him more than anyone or anything else in this film. Not only did he and Jane not have any chemistry (I'm unsure how they even fell in love in this, since they have so few scenes together), he just didn't seem to care at all. He was so dull! The proposal scene was so passionless, and even their kissing looked staged (i.e. their lips did not really touch). He did not show Rochester's brooding/angry side or the humorous side. He just played a block of wood. "},{"Title":"Awful","Date":"20 November 2006","Score":"2 out of 3 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama, Romance","Review":" Awful, awful, awful.

The story is powerful but with the frequency of film adaptations, even the story grows tired, unless someone breathes new life into the interpretation. In this case that breath comes from director Franco Zeffirelli who has engaged Hugh Whitemore to open the story as a screenplay. The results give a different emphasis to the story and one that for this viewer works well.In this particular incarnation the rags to riches heroine Jane Eyre is played with subtlety by the beautiful Charlotte Gainsbourg (with Anna Paquin as the younger version) and Rochester the master of the manor is a William Hurt, playing his character more for life and flesh than the usual darkly sinister keeper of secrets. What results from the combination of cast and crew is a film that is far more a romance than a vapid mystery the fire between Jane and Rochester is palpable and is given more space and time than the other versions which elect to dwell on the mad 'wife' upstairs finally destroyed in the fire that brings Rochester down to Jane's initial stance on the social scale.The cinematography by David Watkin captures the period beautifully as does the musical score by Claudio Capponi and Alessio Vlad. As with all period pieces the cast of supporting characters paint the various aspects of the novel and here such luminous actors as Joan Plowright, Geraldine Chaplin, JosÃ©phine Serre, Maria Schneider, Elle Macpherson, and John Wood among many others offer fully realized portraits of the class distinctions that ruled the era. This is a fine film version of the BrontÃ« novel and one well worth watching repeatedly.

Most importantly, this is the only Jane Eyre film with a plain Jane. Her unattractiveness is absolutely fundamental to the story.Secondly, the age difference between Rochester and Jane is fully realized in this film. In the beginning it is very good, the interpretation of Jane's traumatizing experience in the red room was very well portrayed. I believe that the actors were casted very well. Jane, Mr. Rochester, Mrs. Reed, St. John, all looked VERY similar to what I imagined them as. (The only thing that bothered me about Jane Eyre was her teeth. She seemed to have an overbite of some kind and one would think that she has braces or desperately needs them.) The actors, Jane and Mr. Rochester, made the best out of the script they were given. They were very well paired. I do have several complaints though, I know that one can not transfer a book to film perfectly, but they should follow the story line.The meeting between Mr. Rochester and Jane when they confess there love is to short and lacks the passionate speech and playfulness that the book has. When Jane is leaving Thornfield catches on fire, this happened later. Also in the film Grace Poole dies, this contradicts the book. Also they don't really explain how she hears his voice and how he heard her calling back- this makes the book seem less Gothic. Also in the end Mr. Rochester only regained partial sight in one eye, not all his sight as in the movie. Besides the details the movie is reasonable.The settings are good and has puts on the emphasis on the beauty of nature. The meticulously accurate settings and beautiful-but-gloomy cinematography establish the atmosphere. Even the daytime scenes are drab and colorless, and many of the shots are so dark that it's difficult to see the characters' expressions. There's no doubt that one of the reasons Jane Eyre is sometimes cheerless is because the shadows are often more important than the light. At least in the end, there is a moment of joyful catharsis. With one exception, the acting is excellent. Charlotte Gainsbourg brings Jane to life, and, on those occasions when the script fumbles because it's painting the narrative in too-broad strokes, she holds our attention and captures our sympathy. Unfortunately, Gainsbourg's opposite, William Hurt, lacks presence. His is a passionless portrayal of a tragic figure. The venerable Joan Plowright plays Mrs. Fairfax with grandmotherly goodwill. Josephine Serre, Amanda Root, and Anna Paquin are all solid in smaller roles. Although the superiority of this film can be measured by the plainness of it's leading characters, I must conclude by saying that it is beautifully shot and includes a gorgeous soundtrack.

This Jane is the one with dark and brooding tendencies (played as a child by Anna Paquin, this side of her comes across well); while Rochester is damaged by his past but not quite right in the characterisation, less a gothic hero than a damp squib.A second viewing put both in a more favourable light, but the problem is that 'Jane Eyre' has many other, much better, adaptations out there and this version adds very little.  In the cast we have Billie Whitelaw as a creepy Grace Poole, the reliable Joan Plowright as Mrs Fairfax, Samuel West as the colourless St John Rivers, and Maria 'Last Tango' Schneider as the imprisoned lunatic, Bertha.  One or two scenes stay in the memory - Josephine Serre as the very French Adele; Jane's sketching; the wedding sequences; Jane and Rochester's first meeting (but this scene has been done much better before) - but as a whole it is pretty throwaway and forgettable.

But she confides in us, the readers.  Unlike most who meet her, the audience learns that Jane is highly passionate and needs passion from others in her life.This adaptation, unfortunately, makes no effort to overcome the inherent weakness of film to bring inner life to the screen.  Jane is portrayed as sullen and reticent.  Her few opportunities to engage in witty dialog are bungled either by the screenplay or the actors.  The direction and editing seem hellbent on getting all the important scenes shoehorned into two hours.  What's left is, ironically, one of the most dispassionate films I've ever seen.

As the story goes each becomes the other's savior at different points of the tale.I've always felt that the reason for Jane Eyre's enduring popularity is that it's a tale of both resilience and courage for women in an age when if woman did not have man's protection she was adrift and in trouble. Women were little more than chattel during the Victorian times that Jane Eyre was written.Anna Paquin plays Jane as a child and Jane is one unloved child sent to live with relations who barely tolerate her. She's sent to board with a school run by John Wood playing school master Mr. Brocklehurst, a man with issues. She's treated cruelly and has to watch a young friend die from neglect. But it hardens her character though she wonders if love will come her way.When the grownup Jane Eyre now played by Gainsbourg leaves the school where she has become a teacher she gets a job with Lord Rochester's estate as a governess. The master of the house is rarely there and Gainsbourg is well established by the time William Hurt returns from one of his many trips abroad.Gainsbourg's responsibilities is to Lord Rochester's daughter Adele and she becomes mother and father to the child. The story of the mother is part of the reason for William Hurt's frequent absences. Something in Gainsbourg touches a sentimental and romantic part of Hurt's character. There's still a lot of problems to be resolved. In the end the relative economic positions have been reversed, but these two people need each other more than ever.Charlotte Bronte's novel has certainly got an enduring popularity, this is one of several adaptions to the big screen and small. Gainsbourg compares well with Joan Fontaine probably the most well known portrayer of Jane Eyre. William Hurt is good as Rochester, so good that you hardly notice his distinct American speech pattern. Then again Fontaine's Rochester was Orson Welles another American.Jane Eyre I've always felt was a feminist role model, a woman who makes her way in the world successfully when women were not legal and social equals. It's the reason the story will have an enduring popularity and this version can stand proudly besides previous adaptions.

If you're reading this, you may think you know the story, and how it ends. Let's agree on this from our modern vantage point, if we discovered a previously unknown Charlotte Bronte novel, I don't think it would be difficult to guess the general storyline and character development. Not to say that this makes Bronte uninteresting or unexceptional&#x97;I think you can best appreciate and enjoy Bronte if you know what you're getting into, if you can bring an openness to deeply personal, individual human drama to the reading. Any movie version is an abbreviation. I think this one brings Bronte's protagonists to life in a steadily stronger crescendo of the tragic and fortuitous experiences of two lives that are, at first, on grimly divergent paths, and, finally, reach a happy convergence that literally strikes the sparks of love in the ashes of Thornfield Hall. For me, the romance of Jane Eyre is, of course, the storybook love of Edward, master of Thornfield, and Jane, the governess, but the love story ebbs and flows, and, for me, there is a concurrent theme that is equally satisfying. I am drawn to the stark reality of the separate lives of Mr. Rochester and Jane Eyre, and their gritty willingness to endure that reality, even as they yearn and yearn for the improbably better lives that they can profoundly imagine. Right up to very end, they don't know how it's going to turn out.

It works well in a most charming and emotionally satisfying film. Zeffirelli subdues his Italian over-the top expression of emotion; except for the music which brims with feeling and almost tells the story by itself (Capponi and Vlad). The costumes, cinematography, and story line are subdued but effective. It's a Gothic tale, so the shadows are as important as the light. Rochester is worldly wise and tough as an India rubber ball. He sees austere Jane as having a strange unearthly beauty. He quizzes her about her talent (strange paintings) and asks if that head upon her shoulder has more of the same kind of furniture within ? Jane must subdue her emotions because she is his hired servant.The film is criticized for the seemingly lack of passion between Rochester and Jane, which smolders before it blazes. Also, criticized is an abrupt conclusion, as Zeffirelli quickly fans through the last pages of the novel; and uses his considerable filmatic stagecraft to give a stunning almost dialogue free conclusion. His last visual shot frames the couple in a happy pastoral scene.

Until Jane is about 11 or 12, when she is sent to a boarding school. The aunt makes it clear that she doesn't want Jane to return to her home during holidays.Anna Paquin is the young Jane Eyre and, even though her performance lasts only about the first 20 minutes of the film, it is arguably the most critical one here. She established Jane as a straightforward, truthful person that is willing to buck convention and become a woman of independent thought and independent means.The movie follows the familiar arc of the Jane Eyre story, with Charlotte Gainsbourg as the young adult Jane Eyre , taking the job as governess. Gainsbourg is not really a homely person, but her makeup, wardrobe, and hair style made her look very homely, quite a contrast to the pretty women that the master sometimes brought home.The other key character is William Hurt as Rochester, the master of the estate. He uses a passable English accent and is fine. But the movie works because of Jane Eyre, it is her story.I saw this version just two months after the most current version with Mia Wasikowska as Jane Eyre and Michael Fassbender as Rochester. While both of them are very good, I believe I preferred this 1996 version a bit more, for the way the various scenes were presented, and because Gainsbourg I feel is a more effective young adult Jane Eyre.

I got excited that there was a version I had yet to see and I watched it. It didn't take me long to realize it was ridiculous. The plot strays from the book far too much. The writing of the script was terrible. The acting was terrible. Both Jane and Edward are very passionate people. Jane is rather subdued, but still, when reading the novel and in the other film adaptions, you can catch glimpses of her true character. Both of them in this film were like wooden dolls. So lacking in feeling or conviction. And St. John was shoved in here like an afterthought. His part was nothing like how it was supposed to be and his proposal was mind numbingly, hilariously out of character! I laughed through a great deal of this film.

It is an abridged version in which many critical events are either summarily shown or are omitted. However, It is fairly well organized and well acted.Jane Eyre is a great love story of a couple who meet and feel an immediate attraction for each other. However this attraction evokes conflict in each. This conflict is resolved by suppressing (concealing) their love for one another. Jane's suppression is passive, but Rochester's initial suppression is to treat Jane somewhat coldly, as a master to his servant.However, subtle indications are shown in their relationship where mutual love is hinted - Jane shows jealousy of Rochester's female friend and devoted service to his wishes, while Rochester shows his captivation with Jane's independent and intelligent opinions, her devotion to her moral principles, and her lack of greed and selfishness.However the love grows but remains concealed, again because each is in conflict over loving the other. Jane is in conflict because she realizes she is just a plain Jane - a mere servant (although born into a good family), and below the social status of Rochester who would be a prize catch for any lady of high social standing. Rochester is in conflict, not because of Jane's servant status, which is irrelevant to him, but because of his concealed secret that he must never reveal. So each falls deeper in love while fighting hard to mask any display of their love for one another.Simmering conflicts eventually boil over in seeking resolution. This occurs as the turning point in their relationship.The climatic end is the movie's resolution.Some versions handle some of the above key elements better than other versions, but most are lacking to some degree in portraying most of these elements. Hurt's Rochester is well performed as is Gainsbourg's adult Jane, as are supporting performances. The scene depicting the turning point is well done in this version, but other critical events are perfunctory, summarily done, or are omitted.The film is organized but too choppy, as scenes switch quickly instead of being well developed.I have seen all film versions since 1973 as well as the 1943 version.I think that although all versions are very good, many are lacking in some respects. I like the longer versions best as they are more complete.This one is well worth seeing. Please see my reviews of five other versions of Jane Eyre.

There rather tends to be extra explosions, screams, prolonged farewells and running around mindlessly. Not here. I never expected to see a Jane Eyre without the horrible vision of Bertha in Jane's room and the torn veil, but for some reason this is one of the scenes left out, and it is very telling. The laughter echoing in the corridors is bound to make you uneasy, not scared. The Gothic element is simply missing. And when Jane leaves, she rides a carriage to St John and Mary, whom she's already met, and has no need to wander around the moors without food, dignity or even a name. Nothing dangerous, incredible or hand-of-God-like in all of it.Still this is not a bad film to watch. I liked Charlotte Gainsbourg as Jane, although I too would have liked to see her eventually show more wit and warmth of character, both in the old and the new sense of the word. I still had the feeling it was there, she was a Jane Eyre, she simply didn't have time. Like St John didn't have time to propose or Blanche Ingram to stage the charades, the fortune teller to appear or the triangle of Helen, Miss Taylor and Jane to be played out. Great material for a film, sadly not there. And Rochester... you had to know him to fill in the gaps.But, I have to say, it was weird to see Anna Paquin and Fiona Shaw in the beginning, as Jane and Aunt Reed, hating each other as much as they did as Sookie Stackhouse and Marnie the necromancer!

I liked William Hurt's Rochester better than many have I could detect gentleness beneath the anger.As for the adaptation, much of it seemed very hurried in particular, from the aborted wedding onwards, events were telescoped together very uncomfortably (Jane would have seen the fire if she had looked back, for instance).So, while not disastrous, there have been better adaptations.

But this one really reaches me in a surprising way when every other screen version of Jane Eyre I've seen try to connect the audience to the characters by casting way-too-attractive actors. Admittedly, it's pretty enjoyable to watch two beautiful people fall in love in a fairy tale way. But I couldn't believe for one moment that they're real human beings under those harsh circumstances.Too often Jane Eyre has been portrayed as inexplicably attractive and Mr. Rochester charismatically mysterious. It's refreshing to see an actually plain Jane and a deeply flawed Mr. Rochester. They're not attractive people in general. They're just attractive to each other in their own way. Their bonding doesn't come from their physical presences but from the pain, the unfair fate, and the harsh past they've both endured and survived. On this note, I think this version is by far the most authentic adaptation I've seen.The only complain I have also comes from the major characters - their lack of chemistry in later scenes. It would be more believable if the two actors had shown more genuine emotions for each other. The script, though adequately written, also failed to give them enough space to embody their change of mind states towards the end.Nonetheless, it's a must-see for any classic literature fans. You'll be pleasantly surprised by their different approach to casting and acting, if nothing else.

It is a shame that no one seems to be able to produce a really good film version of this complex story, but this one failed in many ways. The best versions of Jane Eyre are all BBC mini-series Michael Jayston- Sorcha Cusack, Timothy Dalton-Zelah Clarke (the best of the lot) and Toby Stephens-Ruth Wilson. These each had enough running time to do justice to the story, which has many aspects, and all these aspects are needed to explain Jane's character and her relationship with Rochester. The outstanding dialogue of the novel also needs to be included to greater or lesser extent, and all the BBC versions achieve this. This version seemed to leave out the most important exchanges and change all the dialogue - possibly this was Zefirelli's interpretation of the story, but it was frustrating. This version is very European in appearance, even though set in Yorkshire. I didn't warm to Charlotte Gainsbourg unfortunately, and although I am usually a William Hurt fan, he wasn't right for this part. I agree with the person who suggested Alan Rickman - that would be worth seeing, although he is too old now. Rochester needs to look fierce and not very good looking - also needs to be about 37 years old, to Jane's 19. I won't attempt to spell out all the gaps in the plot, or the way that events that were far apart in the novel occurred next to each other in the film. For a viewer who has never seen another version nor read the book, this might be acceptable as a starter, but I would recommend going straight to Timothy Dalton's wonderful portrayal of one of the most charismatic figures in English literature.

While I realise that the length of a film creates the need to condense a novel, in this case it has truly damaged the nature of the work.Jane is clearly portrayed in the novel as a passionate girl and Rochester as a brooding, yet passionate man. However, within this adaptation this passion is sadly lacking. I'm afraid that the monotonic way in which the characters interact leaches so much of the life out of the work that the result is an empty, hollow shadow of the novel.The story line, too, has been altered, in some cases beyond recognition. No Typhus occurs at Lowood, Miss Temple is just an ordinary teacher, Jayne has her hair cut off, Mrs Fairfax appears to know all about the lunatic and can't decide if to tell Jane, Jane and Rochester's failed wedding, her flight and the fire at Thornfield all bizarrely take place on the same afternoon, Bertha essentially murders Grace Poole and for some reason which I cannot fathom St John Rivers and his sister live in the parish of Mrs Reed of Gateshead, indeed Jane arrives at their doorstep! After only one month in bed she leaves with her fortune from her Uncle intact! No relationship is ever mentioned and they are certainly not described as cousins. St John does not every mention a desire to be a missionary and not once does he seem interested in Jane.Despite this, as a work in its own right, there are some good performances; Anna Paquin is wonderful as a young Jane, full of life and passion and JosÃ©phine Serre is charming as little Adele.Personally, however, I believe that there are other adaptations that more accurately portray the feeling of Charlotte Bronte's work and I would steer all viewers in their direction.

Otherwise it could have just been another BBC adaptation. His mastery of the British accent is incredible. The scene with the horse falling on top of him must have had a double but looked so realistic Zefferelli must have had a hand in it. In the 'special' documentary included, you get a different shot of this scene, with camera and prop men in background. Charlotte Gainsbourg is so rightly cast in this.

The major scenes, when included at all, are glossed over, combined, and put out of order in such a way that they completely change the storyline. There was so little transition or even scene development that it would be difficult for anyone not familiar with the story even to follow.

Zeffirelli is known for gorgeously lavish films based of the celebrated classics such as Falstaff (1964), La bohÃ¨me (1965), The Taming of the Shrew (1967), Romeo and Juliet (1968), his most famous and beloved film, one of the best screen romances that made me feel incredibly close to its young doomed lovers, and many more.Zeffirelli's Jane Eyre is the most visually beautiful color adaptation of four I have seen. The color palette for the scenes outside Thornfield Hall is delicate and romantic and creates the right atmosphere for the blooming romance of Mr. Edward Rochester, the Master of the estate and his young employee, pale, thin, almost un-earthy but determined and strong-willed Jane Eyre. Charlotte Gainsbourg, a talented subtle and intelligent actress whom I like in every movie I've seen her made a great Jane. Gainsbourg was surrounded by great supporting cast - Anna Paquin (young Jane), Geraldine Chaplin, Fiona Shaw, and Joan Plowright. Plowright gave the best supporting performance in all Jane Eyre movies as Mrs. Fairfax, a housekeeper of Thornfield Hall and she is one of the reasons to see this movie. Plowright's Mrs. Fairfax is kind, warm woman with sense of humor, intelligence, and understanding of human's nature. She cares about Jane and wishes her happiness but she does not believe that people like Mr. Rochester marry their governesses.Yes, Zeffirelli's film has a lot to admire but sadly there are some major flaws that spoil the film's charm and decreased it to the level of just an average period peace. One of them is miscast of William Hurt. His Rochester reminds more Richard Mason as Charlotte Bronte described him &#150; passionless and blank-eyed. As good as Gainsbourg was, there was no chemistry between her and Hurt. Hurt neither looked nor played right for the part. He was a big disappointment. Another serious problem is the script. Too many important parts were cut out or strangely mixed together, and several scenes in the end of the movie simply did not make much sense. This is a shame &#150; like I've mentioned, the movie had great potentials but did not realize them all.

That being said, I really enjoy this film. It may not be the best version, but it certainly does it's best to stay true to the original story. Charlotte Gainesburg looks and portrays a very convincing Jane Eyre, while William Hurt does a good job as a brooding, moody, passionate Rochester. The supporting cast did a very good job enriching this story, making for all the complexities within the world in which this movie lives. I was impressed with the particularly interesting job done with the character of Bertha Mason, which I think is a very difficult role to make much sense of. Especially in this day and age where so much more is understood about mental health, it is hard to pull off the confinement of Bertha without making it look either like either she was just an outright monster or like cruel and unusual punishment of a person driven to madness. You can really understand why Rochester even cared that she was treated well at all, in spite of his anger about the situation.This is a very difficult book to adapt into a movie. I was disappointed (as I have always been in every adaptation I have seen) in the lack of accuracy of what progressed when Jane had left Thornfield, from the not very dramatic goodbye she gives to Mr Rochester to the struggles she had on her own in the cold cruel world to the quiet and happy but unsatisfying life she lived with the Rivers family. I was surprised at how much they skimmed over and watered down the relationship between Jane and St. John Rivers. There is also maybe a little less of Jane's younger life than I would prefer. It would have been interesting to see a little more of the relationship Jane had with her cousins, both as a child and as an adult (although I must say that Anna Paquin did a wonderful job as an intimidating yet sensitive young Jane). But again, to have all of this portrayed as it was in the book may make the movie suffer in terms of pacing.In spite of any omissions and inaccuracies the movie is very beautiful, and the story is pulled off with all the mystery and suspense and drama without making it look like scene out of a cheesy soap-opera. If you're a purist you may grumble a bit, but for those who have never read Jane Eyre this is a very interesting and, for the most part, a fairly accurate representation of what Charlotte BrontÃ« had written. I have enjoyed watching this movie many times.

With her uncle also deceased, Jane is constantly ridiculed by everyone in the Reed household. However, because Jane has a strong will and often defends herself admirably, the aunt decides to get rid of the dreadful child one day and sends her to an austere religious boarding school run by a Mr. Brocklehurst. Initially horrified by the scant meals and frequent mistreatment of the students, Jane nevertheless applies herself to her studies and becomes a suitable governess. Upon reaching the age of 18, Jane (Charlotte Gainesbourg) secures a job as a teacher to a young girl named Adelle at a mansion in the English countryside. The housekeeper, Mrs. Fairfax (Joan Plowright) welcomes her with open arms and so does the little lady. The master of the home, Mr. Rochester (William Hurt) does not appear until some weeks later, however, as he travels quite frequently. Yet, upon meeting the rather plain Jane, he is struck by her wit and her lively mind. They form what looks like a budding friendship. However, the large house has some quarters which Jane is never allowed to enter, where a mysterious lady named Grace abides. One night, it appears someone in the mansion sets Mr. Rochester's bedroom on fire, with Jane coming to his rescue. Although it obvious that this incident draws the couple even closer, something in Mr. Rochester's past intrudes on any happiness. Will they declare their love for each other? For those who loved the book, and most ladies everywhere DO, this is an acceptable film version of the classic story. True, Hurt does not really fit the physical description of Mr. Rochester (do catch the Orson Welles version) but he is such a capable actor that he really does a fine job as the man with a big secret. Gainesbourgh, too, does a nice turn as Jane and her non-glamorous looks are just what Charlotte Bronte dictated. Then, too, Paquin is marvelous as the young Jane, with Plowright, Geraldine Chaplin, Shaw, and others adding greatly to the film's presentation. Scenery is lovely, natch, while the costumes and sets have the authentic look of an earlier age. In short, if you love romance, mystery, period pieces, and non-objectionable film making, here is the film for one of those quiet nights at home, teacup in hand.

The Mr. Rochester of the book is dark, brooding, not handsome, and above all, British. I guess we can all be grateful that he didn't try to affect an accent, but he was just wrong for the part. There was absolutely no chemistry between Ms. Gainsbourg and Mr. Hurt. I even rented this movie again to see if it was any better the second viewing, but no, it was still a horrible adaptation.Amanda Root was marvelous as Miss Temple, but she was unable to save this movie. I am amazed that someone such as Mr. Zeferelli could ruin such a good story.Those who want to see a good representation of the book should rent the 1983 version with Timothy Dalton and Zelah Clarke (it's now on DVD!). It was made on a shoestring budget, but it follows the story and the performances were true to the book.

Her unhappy childhood made her a truly remarkable, intelligent, yet very sad young woman. She has very intense emotions (mostly sadness and melancholy) but you see it mostly in her eyes, not in her behaviour or in her words. The film doesn't become a fluffy lovestory where the characters speak freely about their emotions, but instead a psychological drama with deep and subtle emotions.The acting was brilliant and I felt every character come to life on the screen.

It is so beautiful with wonderful characters and a great passionate story. This version isn't absolutely awful, but I would be lying if it is the best version, because it isn't.Starting with the redeeming qualities, it is exquisite to watch. The scenery is breathtaking, the cinematography is exquisite and the costumes are beautiful. The score is also excellent, and I liked the scenes in the orphanage. In terms of casting, Anna Paquin is an excellent young Jane, while Charlotte Gainsbourg is quite spirited and fiery. Fiona Shaw, Joan Plowright and Geraldine Chaplin also acquit themselves very well in their respective roles.However, I did feel that the passion of the book was lost here. Why do I think this? Well, firstly there are scenes that do feel very glossed over, while the final twenty minutes are very condensed and rushed. Then the relationship between Jane and Rochester came across as rather passionless and a little dull I think too. The script is lacking too, and Zeffirelli's direction does have its flat spots, and I don't think it helped that the film is too short. While the cast was in general good, I do agree there were some disappointments. Billie Whitelaw's Grace Poole lacks that extra touch of subtlety, while Elle MacPherson was somewhat unlikeable as Blanche, doesn't help her character is like that here. But I do have to concur that the biggest disappointment was William Hurt. Yes his interpretation was more subdued compared to the more boisterious(and more passionate) portrayal given by George C.Scott, but in the process he comes across as wooden and dull.Overall, disappointing. It is ideal for beginners of the book, but for fans it is not so. In fact I couldn't help thinking it would have been better as a mini-series. 5/10 Bethany Cox "},{"Title":"the Italian version is more complete","Date":"13 May 2008","Score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama, Romance","Review":" William Hurt is my preferred Rochester, even with blue eyes and red hair.

The scenery was beautiful, the actors were well cast. The movie was going swimmingly. Then the thing they called my Edward fell off his horse (in an amusing, though unintended way) I took one look at him, and became so horrified that I took the disc out.

He does not carry the look of 'native pith and genuine power' characteristic of Edward (unlike Toby Stephens, who, although looking nothing like Edward from the novel, plays his character well.) and is horribly miscast. Without a well cast Edward, the story is devastated. Not to mention that the perfection of Jane Eyre cannot be contained in a 2 hr. movie. I recommend that you skip this version, and watch the Masterpiece Theater version instead for a Rochester that actually 'feels' like the character. Or the 1983 Dalton version for a Rochester that says much more of the dialogue from the book. (though not acting like him, IMO) Or better yet, read the book. It is far superior to any adaption.

We were a bit nervous about the prospect of watching William Hurt play Rochester but, having enjoyed his Children of a Lesser God and Broadcast News, we were hopeful.Oh, well. There are actors who can deliver wonderfully expressive, understated performances - Amanda Burton and Colin Firth come to mind - and others who are simply wooden, as William Hurt is in this film.The early scenes were well done and promised much. John Wood, Geraldine Chaplin, and Amanda Root were marvelous at the Lowood Three, although Anna Paquin was disappointing as the young Jane. We never believed we were watching a real person but, rather, a young actor in over her head and/or poorly directed.Charlotte Gainsbourg is simply marvelous at the adult Jane. She is eminently believable as someone able to survive her childhood thru strength of personality and character. Joan Plowright is great fun to watch, as always, as Mrs Fairfax, a performance that calls to mind her equally wonderful job in Enchanted April. As other reviewers have noted, there were many fine performances by the supporting cast, excepting only Elle MacPherson. Gawd. Billie Whitelaw and Josephine Serre were particularly good.The final scenes did not live up to the promise of earlier parts of the movie.

But I'm sure to appeal to the masses they went the route of the tragic love story and nothing else. Unfortunately, they didn't even portray that well!! None of the true heartache was represented, major events and major characters were omitted and/or combined and tossed in haphazardly and most disappointing was the casting of Jane.

Charlotte Gainsbourg was distractingly unattractive with an underbite so severe that instead of gazing into Mr. Rochester's eyes with demurity and passion, she stared at him with her mouth hanging open to which you half expected to see drool fall off of her lips! The character of Bertha was also a major disappointment and by the time she was introduced I had already begun to wonder if the director of this film had even read the book!

With modern methods, this bit would probably be unnecessary. Bronte gets away with it by adding in some small side stories and holding the promise of something meaty to come. Its an interesting problem, considering how to wrestle this unwieldy structure into a film that works for a modern viewer. Usually, a filmmaker is constrained by such legacies; he or she has to put every event, every word or enthusiasts of the story who believe themselves to be enthusiasts of the book complain.Zefferelli might be the most interesting adapter because he actually thinks about films and has made some amazing ones both successes and amazing failures. What we have here is some balance. Lots of stuff is jettisoned. Its hard to see (with one exception) what should have been tossed and kept in a different balance. Zefferelli believes that the place has drama, that establishing and dramatizing the place first will provide situational context for the relatively small people that rattle around in it. Its an interesting world, that, and one that rewards because Zefferelli is at root an optimist. So the sets and particularly the exteriors he shows are glorious, even here where he often uses muted colors.You might even like this if you come at the world that way. Its as if the world is so obviously and visually full of structured and deliberate promise that in time it must suffuse even the most vexing structural problem between humans. Its why Zefferelli (a gay agnostic) can make a compelling Jesus movie.But for me there is only one value in this Bronte, and that's in the cutting dialogue between the two almost-lovers. Each superintelligent, each deliberating, and emoting words before the thought &#151; the strategy is complete and thus revealing their inner selves more deeply than if they had encountered a lesser soul.That dialogue is all cut here, a victim of embodying the space.Ted's Evaluation -- 2 of 3 Has some interesting elements.

I liked it that much. It's just what I imagined it to be when I first read the book when I was 18. Contrary to some reviews of the movie I've read, I thought the casting was excellent. Charlotte Gainsbourg has a very nice speaking voice -- she does not lisp. And.. William Hurt as Rochester reminds me of my English literature teacher when I was 18 -- temperament and all. Sigh!!.. And Joan Plowright is excellent.. some younger actresses should learn from her.   "},{"Title":"Dear God! Why this casting?!","Date":"28 May 2005","Score":"1 out of 5 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama, Romance","Review":" Because the story is so amazingly beautiful,I didn't have the heart to give it a bad rating but, as another person here has already said, William Hurt should not have been casted as Mr. Rochester. Alan Rickman would have truly done a lovely job. He is very good at being a consistently cheesed of character, while still bringing a tad bit of dry humor to his roles. (Although I'm not so sure he wasn't offered it and turned it down. He does that often with good stories, unfortunately.) Anyway, the story is brilliant, so if you are deciding on which version of 'Jane Eyre' to watch, this is it, however, I would recommend that you read the book.

However I was a bit disappointed&#133; I'm aware a film cannot represent the whole book, or it would last six hours at least (!), but I was puzzled to see how much of the book has been cut out and, above all, that the film was so full of inconsistencies. What I sometimes felt is as if some scenes were glued on each other without a logic, everything went on too quickly&#133;SPOILERSome things were completely invented, such as the location of the characters of St John and Mary Rivers, who've been found living in Gateshead in the movie (rather than in their own house in Moor House, plus the other sister Diana has been completely omitted, together with the fact that they were actually Jane's cousins); Jane, who gives half her inheritance to Lowood School rather than dividing it in equal parts with her cousins; Jane finding Rochester in Thornfield with Mrs Fairfax at the end, rather than in Ferndean with the servants John and Mary; the fire at Thornfield doesn't take place the day Jane leaves, but two months after; Rochester stays completely blind for two years and than re-gains his sight in one eye partially; AdÃ¨le will not go and live with them, but stays at school&#133; these changing may have been Zeffirelli's choice, but of course not what I expected from the film. I think Zeffirelli hadn't given enough space to some scenes, especially the ones when Rochester proposes to Jane; when she runs away from Thornfield, (in the film she does it suddenly, without a few words spoken between the two of them); the news of the inheritance from her uncle and the proposal from St John to marry him and to leave with him&#133; he should have given them more pathos, more space to the feelings of the characters, especially Jane. END OF SPOILERAll the actors were, however, really good, even the ones who had short parts, like little Jane, I only found Mr Rochester's character a bit too rough and cold, than I felt it was in the book. The settings absolutely gave the idea of the Victorian Age. The film was certainly good, and I found it very moving, but not at all as much as the book which I think is a real 'stream of emotions', incomparable to what you see in the film!!

I'm normally not one for romance, I'm more along the lines of The Patriot or Master and Commander, but this is now one of my favorite movies! It reminds me of Vanity Fair, or rather Vanity Fair reminds me of Jane Eyre, but it is a really well done film! The music is wonderful, which seems familiar...I think they use the same music in Vanity Fair. Jane Eyre is a mixture of romance, drama, and mystery at the same time. I think the entire cast was brilliant and they played their parts well. And the scenery was really beautiful, too! It was a really wonderful film and I can't wait to see it again! "},{"Title":"The Best of the Jane Eyre films.","Date":"6 August 2004","Score":"1 out of 5 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama, Romance","Review":"  I have viewed this film several times over the years, and recently again, today, on DVD. I regard it as the best of the Jane Eyre films. It is a wonderful adaptation with superb acting. I loved Charlotte Gainsbourg as Jane, she did a terrific job and I cannot imagine anyone else in the part after seeing her portrayed by Ms. Gainsbourg. William Hurt, while not my favorite actor, did very well as Rochester, and anything with Joan Plowright takes part in is always worth watching. I do feel that the decision to cast Elle Macpherson as Blanch Ingram was somewhat misguided, but still, I believe this to be a wonderful film for the entire family, and it will renew your interest in the Bronte sisters, especially if you view the 'special features'. I highly recommend this film to anyone who loved the novel.

I always liked William Hurt, loved his hysterical cameo in I Love You To Death, surely he would bring something remarkable to this film?Well, all started well - wonderful lighting, filming, mood and character with great acting from children and grown ups alike.  I was really into this version, it was so moody and dramatic.  Then William Hurt appeared. Got to say, never since the most clumsy B-movie western action shots of the 50s have I seen anything so inept as his first scene - but it's not Hurt's fault.  Instead of his horse being startled by Jane and throwing him, it passes her by quite happily, proceeds down the road a quarter mile and then inexplicably rides into a rock as Hurt slips unconvincingly off.  Unbelievable.  How could Zefferelli think he could get away with that?Clearly, Hurt has neither the brooding magnetism or that quality of being about to explode which is necessary for Rochester.  Oh for the George C Scott version.  Zefferelli obviously realised this problem as he shoots much of Hurt with his back-to-camera or his face in dark shadow.  Frankly, William Hurt is just too nice for this role.The film rambles on, but never recovers from the appearance of Hurt.  The mad wife is weakest of all, she wouldn't frighten a nervous case who'd run out of valium.Shame "},{"Title":"Faithful interpretation of the book with excellent period feel.","Date":"9 January 1999","Score":"2 out of 7 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama, Romance","Review":"  Very well-done translation of one of literature's most popular romantic novels.

The older one was suited to the part--just about the right age and not overly pretty.  In some of the other adaptations I've seen the woman who plays Jane is at least in her twenties, sometimes 30s, and she was supposed to be only 19 or 20 in the book. However, some other things are not quite true to the book.  The characters and scenes would be able to be more developed in a longer movie, but it's still a very enjoyable movie.  It's easy to get into and has nice costumes, etc.  The ending didn't seem as happy or long as I had hoped, but it was still good.

"},{"Title":"great movie BUT severely hindered by the casting decisions","Date":"19 June 2005","Score":"1 out of 7 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama, Romance","Review":" I love the book Jane Eyre and have seen just about every film version--some I have seen several times, in fact. When it comes to the pacing, sets and script, this film is about equal to any other version. However, there is a fundamental flaw in the casting of the two central characters. Anna Paquin as Jane appears way too young for the role and her character seems a bit too sterile and cold (not that Jane is supposed to be Ms. Excitement) and it's even harder to believe that Rochester would fall for her. Rochester, played by William Hurt, is adequate for the part, though perhaps a bit too handsome for the role--the Rochester in the book was worldly but a bit darker and more brooding as a character. The Orson Welles, and especially George C. Scott versions of Rochester seemed a little more accurate. This is not to say I disliked Hurt and he has done several WONDERFUL little films over the years.So, my final verdict is that this is an acceptable version of a great book. You won't dislike the movie but it does nothing to make you prefer this over previous incarnations. "}]
