[{"Title":"Tasteless, but often very funny and sometimes hilarious","Date":"16 May 2001","Score":"42 out of 47 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Romance","Review":"  Let's see...you're watching a movie starring and co-written by Rob Schneider.  You're obviously not expecting something with depth and plausibility.  But he is a talented comedian, and anyone who is an avid SNL fan has seen Rob perform some very funny skits.  He's not Milton Berle, but he has that mindlessly funny comic energy that frequently works. Deuce Bigalow is a film almost aimed at ticking off critics.  Not all audiences will find the crude gags funny, but others--preferably those who can let go of their inhibitions for an hour and a half--will have tons of laughs.  The subplot involving Deuce's father as a bathroom attendant is pretty cheap.  It's an obvious setup for scatological gags.  One of them involving a scene in which Deuce is having a pleasant man-to-man talk with his Dad while you can hear the groans of someone in one of the stalls loudly...relieving himself made me roll with laughter.  I wouldn't call it a priceless gag, but you don't always have to aim high with comedy.  If it's funny, it's funny.  If you laughed, you laughed.  Just like any Farrelly Brothers movie, there are gags involving physical handicaps like obesity, narcolepsy and Turrett's Syndrome.  However, the jokes are executed in such a broad manner that no one--even ones with any of those disorders--shouldn't be offended.Naturally, some will hate this movie, some will like this movie, some will love this movie.  In my mind, if it's a comedy and I'm laughing--what other factors should I be looking for?

Yes, it's crass, crude, stupid and whatever but it's generally likable and a funny movie in many spots.Rob Schneider does a fine job playing this amiable loser. Several scenes are just laugh-out-loud funny. The female interest, Arija Bareikis, is not someone I was familiar with but I liked her wholesome looks. William Forsythe plays the villain and, of course, he's over-the-top. The film had a nice soundtrack, a lot of familiar rock tunes.As with most modern comedies, this gets carried and a little stupid at the end but, overall the film is good low-grade fun (and I mean low grade!)

Thoroughly enjoyable as long as you're not looking for One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest.  Deuce Bigalow provides a deft blend of juvenille humor and inventive verbal humor and situational gags.  I have to say that it has one of the funniest reconcilation scenes in a romantic comedy that I have seen in a long time.  But the great thing about this movie is that Rob Schneider has created a couple of really memorable and unique characters.  On top of that, there are many wonderful and touching moments hidden beneath the more obvious jokes and the many throwaway gags.

For this lame brained comedy, beyond being incredibly juvenile and silly in its comedic temperament, also manages to be as politically incorrect as possible, using as its targets the obese, the handicapped and an assortment of social outcasts and misfits.  And, although the ribbing is generally quite good-natured and even affectionate at times, one can't help but feel a little guilty about laughing.The formula for the film adheres very closely to the one employed by virtually all Saturday Night Live or Second City alumni in their initial forays into big screen comedies.  Once again we have the usual bumbling nerd trying to win acceptance as a `cool dude,' making a shambles of everything he touches, yet ultimately managing to garner the respect of his peers and the love of a beautiful woman.  Rob Schneider plays the title role, a professional fish tank cleaner who, through a complicated series of circumstances, finds himself delving into the realm of `man whore' in order to earn some much needed money.  The stupidity of the premise and the situations cannot be underestimated as Schneider is put through a series of pratfalls, misunderstandings and verbal slugfests that are often quite amusing almost in spite of themselves.  It takes either a certain amount of daring or a shocking degree of insensitivity (or perhaps a little of both) to line up a series of jokes and sight gags aimed at people who suffer from obesity, Tourettes Syndrome, Narcolepsy, blindness and limb amputation  - but this film does it.  Somehow, though, the film manages to treat its characters with such a genial fondness that it never seems particularly harsh or mean spirited.  Whether or not that mitigates the feeling of guilt resulting from one's laughter must, finally, be a matter of personal conscience I suppose.Schneider plays the lead in a nicely relaxed fashion, not succumbing to the hyperbolic mugging that so many comics are prone to indulge in when faced with similar roles.  And what a pleasant surprise to encounter Marlo Thomas of all people in an uncredited cameo appearance &#150; and still looking like a knockout in her sexy lingerie.  `Deuce Bigalow' may not sit well with the easily offended or with those who prefer their comedy to be of a bit more - um, shall we say - cerebral nature.  Still, unabashed silliness makes for a fun time every now and then and, in that spirit, this film deserves to be seen.

All in all it is quite a good movie, even though it is a real no-brainer.Deuce Bigalow used to work as a tank cleaner in SeaWorld, but got fired because he was cleaning the tanks in the nude in front of a lot of people. Since than he cleans domestic fish tanks for a living. This job brings him into contact with Antoine Laconte, who works as a male escort and owns a gigantic apartment, filled with all kinds of precious items. One of these is a tank full of very expensive fish.When one of the fish gets sick Deuce is asked to help and, since Antoine is going to Europe for 3 weeks, he has to check in on the apartment daily to look at the fish. But instead of checking in on Antoine's home, Deuce takes the opportunity to move into the flat. He accidentally sets fire to the toaster and breaks the fish tank. Knowing that Antoine will kill him for that when he sees it, Deuce has to make sure everything is exactly the way it was. But that will cost a lot of money... which he doesn't have. To raise enough money in that short period of time he decides to start working as a low-budget male gigolo.As you can expect in this kind of movie, he doesn't meet any normal women who want to make use of his services. It is a real freak show, filled with a 500 pound woman, a woman who's about 8 feet tall... The movie is full of this kind of predictable facts, but when you are prepared for it, it really doesn't bother. Don't expect to see a highly sofisticated movie, but it isn't as bad as you might expect. One of the scenes that I really liked were the parodies on other movies like The Matrix.I would recommend this movie to everybody who doesn't mind laughing about older and predictable jokes. It's an excellent movie when you came home from a hard day at work, when you are tired and looking for a good laugh without having to think too much. I reward it with a 7/10.

I had a grin on my face from beginning to end, and after seeing it numerous times, still laugh like it is the first time I am seeing it.The plot is as you probably know a 'loser' who is obsessed with fish and is house sitting for a real life gigalo. while trying to do some hilarious stunts in the condo, accidentally ruins the fierce gigalo's expensive aquarium. The clock is on, Deuce has 3 weeks to come up with six grand to have the tank rebuilt. and you can guess how Deuce is going to make the money back can't you? of course, becoming a gigalo. Now with Deuce only charging 10$ it will take a miracle to get the money, but with a little help from his derranged clients, ranging from overweight to tourette's syndrome, and the pimp T.J, Deuce is able to make more money, but there is still the fear of detective Fowler who wants a hold of Antoine's (the real gigalo) black book.As the main plot of the movie itself is flat out hilarious it's the little things that really count. such as Deuce's homosexual friend who makes a homosexual comment with every thing he says, it just makes the movie even better to enjoy. Go into this movie ready to laugh so hard you will cry and you will not be disappointed.

One day Deuce got a job cleaning an outdoor pond at a Male Gigalo's mansion. Deuce falls in to the pond and is helped out by the male gigalo himself. He invites Deuce in for a drink and they start talking.Inside this manison is wide screen tv's, talking microwaves and everything else that we only dream of owning. Deuce then discovers that inside this man has got an $8000 fish tank with expensive and rare fish. But the most rarest is quite ill. So The Gigalo asks Deuce to watch his house and fish for 3 weeks while he is away. The gigalo warns him not to break anything or he will be dead meat. Deuce nervously agrees.While Deuce has got bread in the toaster he decides to try out the indoor exercise equipment, including hanging upside down and swinging like tarzan. While deuce is upside down he realises that his toast is burning and the fire is spreading rapidly but Deuce cant get down so he swings over to the fish tank to get a grip whilst he tries to get down but yep you guessed it the tank falls over and smashes leaving the fish waterless.Deuce places all the fish into seperate containers with water and tries to think how he can make the money for the tank. While he is sleeping he can hear a girl on the answering machine asking for the male Gigalo. Deuce wakes up, picks up the phone and accepts the offer. So from there on he's known as Deuce Bigalow Male Gigalo. But all he's trying to do is earn enough money to get a new tank within 3 weeks...

Anyhow, I came out of that theater having one of the best laughs I'd had in quite a while.  The film had me rolling for start to finish, truly fantastic.There are so many lines in this film that I can't help but quote to my friends and fellow-movie-goers.  The writing in this film, while being quite silly and rather odd, is excellent!  The characters are hilarious and really well done and the story is brilliant.The cast is surprisingly good as well.  Rob Schneider pulls off his best performance to date and really gets the laughs.  Oded Fehr was a really nice addition to the film, definitely not someone I'd expect to see in a film of this sort, but I'm glad he was in it, he added a great deal to the film.  Eddie Griffin steals the show in every scene and is hysterical throughout the film.  William Forsythe is another actor I would never have expected to be this type of film, but again, I'm very glad that he did.  His performance was superb, and very well done.  I'd never heard of Arija Bareikis, but I will definitely be keeping my eyes open for her in the future.  What an angel!  Richard Riehle was a very nice touch, playing the part of Bob Bigalow, Deuce's father.  Another great character played by a great actor.  And I feel compelled to mention Gail O'Grady and Jacqueline Obradors...all I can say DAMN!!!  Both of these women are quite the lookers and I will most definitely be watching for these fine actresses in the future.  This list is getting long, but I also have to mention Amy Poehler, probably best known for her roles on Late Night with Conan O'Brien and currently on Saturday Night Live, she plays a fantastic character with Tourette's Syndrome in the film and does is so well it's frightening.  The rest of the cast is great too, but I can't list them all.Anyhow, if you like Adam Sandler type movies, or just silly comedies, then you definitely need to check this film out.  But please don't get your expectations too high, this definitely won't be everyone's cup of tea.  I truly enjoyed this film and hope that you will too.

Deuce mistakenly answers the gigolo's business phone and finds himself having sex with a woman he's never met and getting paid for it (not a bad deal, since women generally avoid Deuce "},{"Title":"The most guilty pleasure the cinema has to offer.","Date":"8 December 2005","Score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Romance","Review":" I was excited to see this movie. I'm an Adam Sandler fan, and was expecting a movie that was similar to (and more crude) than Adam's other movies. Now, many people will tell you that this is just a Sandler movie without the Sandler, but believe me. It's not. Adam's movies, while not necessarily good quality, are well executed. They have developed characters, and developed plots. This movie has no development of any kind. The film opens with Rob Schneider cleaning a fish tank at an aquarium. A whole bunch of people are watching in disgust, and it turns out... (gasp)... HE'S NAKED! It proceeds with having him walk around the town naked, and causing an elderly woman to fall off a bus. Funny? Well, actually, yes. It is.Rob Schneider plays Deuce (Rob Schneider), a fish tank cleaner, and born loser. Women avoid him like the Ebola virus. If you thought Adam Sandler portrayed losers, they're nothing compared to the character of Deuce Bigalow. He is hired to house sit for a handsome, and suave male prostitute, who tells Deuce that if he messes up his beautiful apartment, he'll kill him.Deuce quickly manages to destroy his kitchen, and his $6000 fish tank, in a well executed slapstick sequence. His only hope to save his butt is by becoming a gigolo himself. Predictable comedy ensues. Every woman who hires Deuce just happens to be handicapped in the most twisted fashion. One woman has a case of Tourette's syndrome. She spews profanity like there's no end. That's not how people with Tourette's act. Another woman has narcolepsy, and others have height and massive weight problems. These gags are mentioned better than they are executed. He soon falls in love with his only beautiful client.One good performance is by Eddie Griffin. He plays Deuce's pimp, and constantly uses the terms man whoring, and he-bitch.This movie is actually good for a few laughs. I just doubt that you've ever seen such a poorly made film. The scenes are all rushed. In fact, the whole movie feels rushed. There's never more than about three people in one scene. The whole thing is over so fast, you'll feel cheated. It's hard to describe. It's a 6/10, just barely saved by a few laughs.Deuce Bigalow Male Gigolo is rated R for Sexual Content, Language, and Crude Humor.

I mean what can one say? It was NOT at all what I had expected it to be. I remember a few years ago seeing advertisements for this movie and right away I branded it as one of those unfunny, typical, teenage, nonsense humour stories like the so many that come out to-day. So because of that I had no intention of seeing it and didn't make an effort. One day one of my friends asked me to go along with him and a few others as a group, and when I learnt we were seeing this film I was a bit edgy. However, I was wrong and it surprised me. Deuce Bigalo isn't just a story about junior high laughs and giggles and stupid dialogue, it has more of a story about life to it. I mean look how much emphasis we put on looks and popularity, money and wealth. We are forgetting the whole kindness factor that is involved. We have to once in a while move away the clothes make the man stereotype and look deeper. Many people will find it easy to relate to Deuce due to his lack of social skills with the ladies and being a blue-collar worker. It has a happy ending which one should expect, but in a bit of a different sense. Even some older people I know were shocked after viewing this show. But due to its advertisements from the past and humour that many others can not look past (and I don't totally blame them) unfortunately this movie will never get the respect it deserves and will for ever remain only a shadow with the other crap that comes directly to the shelves after two weeks of theatre these days. Rent it if you have an open mind or need some cheering up. It always works for me!

That being said, let's state one other obvious thing it works, as long as you don't try to take it too seriously. There's no message here and no strongly developed plot. This movie is just meant to be fun - and it turns out that it is.Rob Schneider is perfectly cast as the geeky fish tank cleaner Deuce Bigalow, who ends up - by accident! - working as a man-whore to earn money to fix the damages he's done to the real gigolo's expensive apartment. The supporting cast is wonderful. Who wouldn't laugh at Eddie Griffin as T.J. - Deuce's man-pimp. Among the series of women Deuce is sent to satisfy, Amy Poehler caused great laughter as Ruth, suffering from Tourette's Syndrome, and the movie was absolutely stolen by Fluisa (played by Big Boy) the VERY heavy woman who is Deuce's first customer.As I say, don't take this at all seriously.

This is just one of those movies where everyone working on it knows that no matter how well their movie does at the theatres or the video stores, they'll never have something which bowls over the critics (who, justifiably, are interested in slightly more intellectual movies).But as it stands it actually does a pretty decent job of what it sets out to do, an oddball comedy.  For me it mainly does that out of what you don't get as much as what you do get.I think the highlight might actually be Rob Schneider's handling of the role.  Normally in this kind of movie you expect the lead to exaggerate everything and generally not act much better than the bit parts that surround him, but that's not what I saw.  It wasn't that hard to feel some sympathy for the character of Deuce a man who for all his faults is earnest, and when life gives him the short straw seems unfairly beaten down.What's scary is that, for a movie such as this, I actually thought the interaction between Deuce and his love interest was surprisingly good.  It's not like some of the developments were unexpected - as I said, this was never meant to be Oscar material - but as I watched the scenes play out on my TV I actually had some interest in how they panned out, even though there wasn't really any question about it.I was also a bit pleased with the (relative) dignity the movie kept up.  For a movie with a title like this one's there was a surprising lack of crudeness, although obviously it was impossible to leave it out (the girl with Tourette's Syndrome seems to get a large chunk of it all by herself).  I'm writing this comment in the summer of 2000, and compared to the similar comedies that came out this season (Road Trip, Scary Movie, Me Myself & Irene) it makes Deuce look like a model of class and refinement.  There was more significance in this movie's message than in all the 2000 summer comedies combined.Of course, this could never be a perfect movie, and so there are still going to be problems.  I thought that the first quarter or third of the movie was only so-so; it took the remaining part to really get the movie off the ground.Since this is supposed to be an off-kilter comedy, there are certain assumptions that you can make about what might not be right.  For instance, while all the supporting cast (in this case those outside of Deuce, Kate and TJ) does a decent job of moving the story along, you know the acting isn't going to be as good as you might want from them.The plot twists are also not exactly going to have a Sixth Sense shock effect either.  The storyline is something we've all seen before - it's just done well enough not to scream it out to you.Would I have made the effort to see this when it was originally in theatres?  I don't think so.  But seeing it on video was fine - and if your opinion of Deuce is worse than mine, at least take comfort in that it all wraps up neatly in a little under 90 minutes.

Although I've never been a big Rob Schneider fan, I've always liked Saturday Night Live and their alumni, and I usually enjoy the movies they make. I was hoping this movie wouldn't be too similar to most Adam Sandler movies that are made. Most of them are stupider than they are funnier. I'd rather watch a movie like TOMMY BOY or THE MAN WHO KNEW TOO LITTLE than WATERBOY or BILLY MADISON. So I was hoping DEUCE BIGALOW be a little more like those movies. It turns out, this movie was worse than the Adam Sandler movies, and I found most Sandler movies funnier.Deuce Bigalow (Rob Schneider) plays a pathetic, unemployed, fish-loving tank cleaner who gets a job by a very big male prostitute named Antoine LeConte (Oded Fehr) to take care of his house for three weeks. When Deuce almost destroys the house, he needs to make a few thousand dollars quickly. Through a guy named T.J. (Eddie Griffin) he is able to get a job as a gigolo, but every girl he tries to give pleasure is very unusual and strange. He finally falls in love with a woman named Kate (Arija Bareikis).Although it had its moments, DEUCE BIGALOW MALE GIGALO didn't strike me as very funny. The story line is useless (although it isn't really mean to be very important) and most of the jokes that weren't used on the commercials don't work. The funniest parts of the movie were the Matrix spoofs and a few of the jokes, but all of which were already used on the commercials.The acting was nothing special, but not so bad. Rob Schneider does fine, but again, nothing special. Arija Bareikis does pretty well as Deuce's girlfriend. Oded Fehr did a pretty good job as the huge, strong male hooker. Eddie Griffin and William Forsythe (who plays a detective) play incredibly annoying characters with not-very-great acting jobs. Norm Macdonald has a pretty good cameo as well.Story line? Give me a break. It's just Deuce going from one nutcase girl to another and falling in love with the only normal one (well, mostly). Some of the girls do have funny moments, but not enough for me to say I recommend this movie.

It's a big fat shame that not all the actors from this movie rose to stardom afterward. DBMG is also about the only movie that packs a believable romance and happy end -- usually, that segment is merely stapled on to compensate the girlfriend for having to endure a gross-out comedy on her date and to put her in the right mood for post-theatrical hanky panky. And you can watch this movie either end to end, or just tune in for a ten minute clip and still be entertained and amused.The only aspect that I'd criticise about DBMG is that a few scenes seemed to be somewhat first-take-ish, not refined enough (and refinement is the essence of good comedy). Like when Bergita (the blind chick) and TJ (the male madam -- no, wait ...) get it off in the closet and Bergita says I can see again (yeah ...) Hey, you're black (funny) I knew (yawn -- black man, big penis, must have been a killer joke back in the 1950ies). That's just a scene that could have been done better. But hey, I'm nitpicking here. Deuce Bigalow is an underrated comedy classic. And it's got an impressive soundtrack, too.

Deuce teams up with a man-pimp (Eddie Griffin), gets harassed by a crazed cop (William Forsythe), and of course falls in love with a cute client (Arija Bareikis). The nonsensical plot is festooned with gags about wet T-shirts, foul-mouthed senior citizens, flatulence, Tourette's syndrome, necropsy, and just about everything else you might imagine. More surprising is that, by and large, the movie works. It's a combination of bad taste and kindheartedness, similar to There's Something About Mary, which Deuce Bigalow is clearly emulating. It's not the pat people should learn to accept themselves for who they are theme or the formulaic happy ending; it's that the movie understands that sex is not the same thing as happiness or contentment. For all its crassness, Deuce Bigalow actually treats its characters as people, and the result is silly, obnoxious, and enjoyable.

The jokes are very good and the Rob Schneider's acting too. In his own personal way he can be a great comedian. The plot is kind of original and has some really funny circumstances and characters (the girls who search for his services are very well created, as characters, and are very funny, each one with her peculiar characteristic&#133;).

I watched it yesterday and over all I thought it was alright. To be honest I never really was a big fan of Rob Schneider anyways, but he was actually pretty likable in Deuce Bigalow. Though it didn't really make me laugh, Duece Bigalow is a likable romantic comedy that is a spoof off of American Gigolo. At times the humor is a bit immature and typical, but there are a couple of laughs here and there.Duece Bigalow is a man who takes very good care of fishes. One day he comes across a man, Antoine, who just seems to get all the babes and has a fabulous house. He finds out the way he gets this living is from taking money from pleasuring these women, he's a man whore. When he has to go away for 3 weeks, he asks Duece to look over the house, Duece destroys the house and needs 6 thousand dollars fast, and of course how he is he gonna get it? That's right, he shall become the ultimate man whore and ends up finding the love of his life.Over all Duece Bigalow Male Gigolo is a likable movie, I'm not sure if I would watch it again, but it is worth a look. The acting is just what you would expect, it's average, but the story is pretty funny. The things that made me laugh mostly were when Duece is getting all the messed up female john's and just his reaction was pretty funny. So I would say that you could give this movie a look if you're in the mood, but for me, it's a one time watch.5/10 "},{"Title":"Crude humor.

He is a cleaner of fish-tanks, who's being asked to house-sit an apartment of a male gigolo (played by that Arabian dude from THE MUMMY). He manages to totally wreck it and decides to be a man-whore for a while to pay for the repairs before the other gigolo comes back from Europe. The destroying of the apartment is pure slapstick, and from then on the movie uses a lot of repetitive, vulgar jokes concerning Duece's clients. The woman who has Turrett's Syndrome is hilarious. She cranked me up every time. The story is however extremely predictable, so no surprises there. But it is worth a watch and certainly has its funny moments. It's just brainless sex-orientated fun.

Unfortunately, I can't say this movie was worth the $3.99 rental (DVD).   The jokes seemed like they SHOULD be funny, but everything fell flat.  As if they used all the takes that just didn't `click,' didn't have the right comic timing.  Maybe it was the director's fault, maybe it was due to bad editing.  But something kept this entire flick on the `feeling forced' level.Besides the main story-driven bits of schtick, there were tons of amusing little side moments - like conniving the cute fish-store clerk to get some sea snails out of the bottom of the tank (this made her breasts dip into the cold water), and the tomato slice falling out of TJ's sandwich, only to `wash ashore' on Deuce's chest - but nothing seemed to work naturally. Everything felt awkward.  Failing most notably were the voiceovers of supposed passers-by yelling nasty jokes to Deuce's freakishly tall date, and the scene of dialogue between Deuce and his father in the men's room (while another man had a noisy bowel movement -- perhaps the only time I've never laughed at poop noises).  These especially lacked any comedic finesse. If another director, or perhaps editor, or perhaps a bigger budget are used next time out, then I will look forward to the supposed sequel, `Deuce Bigalow, Electric Gigolo.'  The premise is good, Schneider is good, the jokes were even good, but the slap-dash feel of this movie ruined all it's potential.In a film all about beauty vs ugly, Rob Schneider ain't THAT ugly.  The ugliest sight was Eddie Griffin in white-face.  EEK!  Big Boy as Fluisa was pretty funny (probably the funniest in the film), the gay fish tank repair guy was amusing, and hey, Oded Fehr great ass, fella.  (But another nagging question  why did this Israeli actor, whose character's name is so French (Antoine Laconte) speak with what seemed to be a Russian accent?  Weird. But.. great ass, guy!)Oh, and as far as the DVD goes, there was very little in the way of `Extras.'  Almost none, in fact.  There were about five or so very brief clips of actors on the set commenting about the film between clips from the trailer.  And there were some previews of other films.  That's about it. Lame.

While the plot is derivative and the jokes appeal to the least common denominator, the one thing that sets this film apart from other recent films starring recent SNL graduates (Mike Ferrell, Adam Sandler, Chris Farley, David Spade), is that Rob Schneider is actually a likeable guy.  While Adam Sandler is insulting people, Rob Schneider plays the everyman caught in the worst possible scenario becoming a man-whore.  While many of the gags make light of disabilities (narcolepsy in a bowling alley, fish martini, blind woman cooking eggs, turretts syndrome at Yankee Stadium, prosthetic leg, etc.), we come to see through Schneider's everyman eyes that these women are important and deserve love like anyone else. If you liked Ben Stiller in There's Something about Mary or Jack Black in Shallow Hal, you should like Rob Schneider as Duece Bigalow, Male Gigolo.

I was pleasantly surprised to find out it was more funny than a lot of people give it credit for. As the previous commenter mentioned, it is a bit formulated in that SNL way (i.e. go through a hassle to get the girl and the money).

In other words, if you weren't paying a lot of attention watching this, you missed some of the best parts.

Well Deuce is broke, so he stumbles across the idea of becoming a male gigolo.

The truth of the matter is that this really isn't a very good movie, and yet there are individual scenes that made laugh harder than any comedy this year. I can't recommend it overall, and yet if you're a fan of this kind of comedy you may find it's worth your time. Rob Schneider stars as Deuce, a lowly professional fish tank cleaner (!) who lusts after the girl who works in the local pet shop (he even has her unknowingly dunk her upper extremeties into the cold fish tank water at the shop so he can enjoy the view). He has no luck with women, and seems about ready to hang it up when he meets up with Antoine (Oded Fehr), a male gigolo who needs someone to watch his home while he is in Switzerland on business. Upon finding out that Deuce knows all about his sick rare fish, Antoine asks him to look after the fish and his house, a turn of events which Deuce sees as a great possibility to score. Well, one thing leads to another and soon Deuce finds himself pretending to be a male gigolo to repair the mess he's made of Antoine's apartment. Most of the laughs in Deuce come from the humorously problem-ridden women Deuce has to take out as part of his job. There's a narcoleptic who falls asleep while bowling, an oversized woman who stores pieces of chicken in her clothes, a woman who's so huge that Deuce can barely fit her feet in his hands, a woman with Tourette's who uncontrollably utters profanities, and so forth. Some of this is quite funny. Also funny is Eddie Griffin as T.J., the man-whore pimp who gives Deuce advice and a makeover to turn him into a man-whore. Griffin is actually one of the best things in the movie -- his running gag with the hot tub is great, and he puts a little spin on some of the dialogue that puts it just over the top. The movie has a lot of lulls though, and there's one running gag I didn't think worked at all -- the private detective who pursues Deuce throughout the entire movie and tries to coax him to look at his privates. Also not funny is the oppressively gross bathroom humor involving Deuce's father, who works in the restroom at a restaurant (if you see the movie you'll see what I mean). The movie has the feel of an Adam Sandler flick, but I actually enjoyed it more than Sandler's last movie, Big Daddy (which was too heavy on the sappy stuff and just too too dumb). It's really lowbrow, and pretty much makes There's Something About Mary seem like Frasier on the intelligence scale. But if you turn off your brain, or if you are just in the mood for silly, goofy humor (especially if you're a Sandler fan), you could do a lot worse than Deuce.

Get your snacks before it starts because the pacing is fast, and it's joke after joke.  Ironically, what makes this movie work so well is the way Schneider is not center stage.  Oh sure, the story revolves around him, but it is the collection of characters around him and their twisted quirks that bring the comedy home.  Schneider is more suited for this low key capacity while leaving the jokes and sight gags to the supporting cast.  This doesn't mean Deuce is the best thing out there; but if you're looking for some decent laughs this one won't disappoint you.

There are more than a few hilarious scenes and sight gags, but there are also some parts that are embarrassingly bad. The film proves just how difficult it is to make a comedy that is funny for 90 whole minutes.Deuce Bigalow is played by Rob Schneider, who is in my opinion a terribly underrated actor. More often that not it's the material in his films that lets him down. He plays an unlucky loser who cleans fish tanks for a living. The only action he gets with the ladies is when he can get the girl at the local pet store to reach into a fish tank causing her shirt to become wet and her nipples to be erect. In a stroke of luck, a handsome gigolo (Fehr) named Antonio hires Bigalow to watch his apartment and his sick fish while he's away in Europe. Unfortunately, Bigalow trashes the place and has to raise a good chunk of cash to repair the damage or the psychotic Antonio will dispose of him. Bigalow has no choice but to go into the gigolo business for himself, only Antonio's regular customers expect quite a bit more than he can offer. Bigalow is forced to tend to the needs of women with problems ranging from mental disorders to physical abnormalities. Most of his dates with these women are hilarious. Deuce even falls in love with one of the young ladies along the way. The race is on to see if he can raise the amount of cash needed to make the repairs to Antonio's place before he gets back home.The film has some truly hilarious moments. Some highlights include Deuce's pimp explaining to him why he is only good enough for the women at the bottom of the tank, and pretty much any scene where he's out on a date with these problematic women is funny, too. Schneider has a real human quality about him, and he's a guy you can really root for.There are some absolutely dopey parts to this film, though. For one thing, there's a running subplot involving William Forsythe playing a paranoid police detective who keeps showing Deuce his penis. There is also an agonizing scene in which Deuce and a hooker have a Kung Fu type fight scene in Antonio's apartment. Why were these scenes left in? Well, if you look at the finished product, it's still only 88 minutes long. I guess it really is nearly impossible to sustain a truly funny film for the standard 90 minutes or so that most films last. It almost makes you wish that the bad parts of comedies could be trimmed away and maybe the audience could be treated to two short comedy films back to back. For example, take the best parts of Deuce Bigalow and then show them in a double feature with the best hour of The Animal. That's my idea, anyway.Deuce Bigalow made $65 million dollars in its theatrical run. That kind of cash guaranteed a sequel would be made, and sure enough it was. The poisonous reviews it has received have kept me away from it so far.6 of 10 stars for the original.The Hound.

The plot is meaningless; little more than a very vague frame for a load of rather crass jokes &#150; pretty much what you expect if you're sitting down to watch a film with Rob Schneider in the title role. This is not to say it is totally worthless but it does aim very low (and hits its own target!) and if you like that sort of thing then you should get something from this. For me I found it a bit boring and only laughed once or twice (and even then I felt bad for it) as too many of the jokes were just too uninspired and crass for my own taste.Schneider is suited to this material and that is a good thing and a bad thing. He seems happy with what he is doing and his delivery helps the material (but still doesn't make it any good). Griffin is funnier as TJ and he did have me laughing occasionally but Forsythe is embarrassing. He looks out of place and he deserves a lot better than the stupid and silly role he has here.

It's full of dirty jokes and childish humor, but underneath all of the goofball comedy, it actually comes through with a very healthy message, which is virtually non-existent in these dumb comedies. Deuce Bigalow is a lowly fish tank cleaner, and when one of his important clients has to leave town on business, he hires Deuce to look after his place and especially one of his precious fish, which would not survive on it's own the entire time that Anton (the client) is out of town. Needless to say, Deuce starts screwing around in the lavish apartment and breaks Anton's ridiculously expensive fish tank and then has to come up with $6,000 to replace it and do other repairs around the house. This is when Deuce has the brilliant idea to assume Anton's job as a gigolo, because he knows he'll never make the money on time cleaning fish tanks. Unfortunately, he gets all of the freaky clients, like the gigantic black woman (`Did you say steak?') and the eight foot tall girl (`That's a huge bitch!'), the girl with narcolepsy that falls asleep at the weirdest times, and of course, they could never leave out a date with Tourette's syndrome, definitely the least amusing of all of them. So Deuce goes through all of these awful dates, and then he meets a girl on another date that is perfect except she has a prosthetic leg. This is where the healthy message comes in, because Deuce learns that he really loves this girl, and it really doesn't matter to him that she only has one leg. He falls in love with her pretty quick, but the romance of it all, as cheesy as it was, is actually pretty well done. Deuce is trying to get enough money to replace the stuff in Anton's apartment, so he goes on one last date with one of Anton's stunningly beautiful clients, and he even rejects her aggressive sexual advances because he's in love. Sure, he does a pretty graphic strip-tease for her, but you get the point of his intentions.However, despite the fact that the movie is full of goofy jokes, some of the comedy was pretty good. Deuce's toilet-cleaning father was pretty amusing at some points, and most of all, the detective that was after Deuce and especially Anton (his wife was one of Anton's clients) was hilarious in every scene he was in. `I got a thin dick!' Why is that so funny? It's totally dumb, but it just cracked me up. Maybe it's because he compared it to spaghetti. It was just great how he was at first really threatening to Deuce, and then he would suddenly ask his advice about whether Deuce thought he could make some money in the gigolo business or what he thought that red spot on his penis was (`It wasn't there this morning, I checked!').As a whole, this is another one of those brainless comedies aimed at immature or uneducated (or both) audiences, but it doesn't fail on just about all levels like most of these types of movies always seem to do. It's a strong and healthy message delivered in questionable packaging.

The gags almost all rely upon sex, bodily fluids/sounds and/or other such crude innuendo for laughs - and it very rarely delivers any.

I should've known when in the first few minutes, they resort to making an old lady slip on the wet steps of a bus.  Come on, what is this, the banana peel school of comedy??

When Rob smashes the guy's several thousand dollar tank, he resorts to dating a myriad of weirdos to make the money back.  The script (co-authored by Schnieder himself) goes for easy laughs dependent on people's sicknesses, like Tourettes' Syndrome (constant swearing) or narcolepsy (a girl falls asleep while throwing a bowling ball).  Some of the other dates I smiled at a couple times, but never did I laugh out loud.  Especially at the ridiculously overused term man-whore.  Or the totally out of place Matrix like effects that I could see being in a slapstick spoof, but not in a regular comedy.  It got to the point where I was like ok, I get it already!

This movie... no matter what critic, no matter how scathing, how cruel and cold... when it comes to movies like this... the press is powerless.Really, who cares what the critics say? This is not the newest political biography by Oliver Stone.Movies like this are just meant to make you laugh. And this one does. But Definitely not enough.I was really looking forward to this one. I was in the mood for a Dumb & Dumber or Kingpin type of comedy and I saw some of the ads for this one and it looked fairly funny. So when it first came out on video, I rushed out to get it.I've enjoyed most of Sandler's stuff, the Farrelly Brothers movies and just about every movie from the comic film firm of Zucker-Abrahams-Zucker. So, surely, I'd like this one.Deuce Bigalow Male Gigolo is a vomit bag of a movie. Granted, that's more or less what I was looking for... but it was the WRONG kind of vomit.THE PLOT IN A NUTSHELL Goofy, homely and pathetic fish-tank cleaner Deuce (who's also a fish specialist) winds up playing house-sitter and fish doctor for a luxurious gigolo. Disaster hits (of course) and in a last desperate resort to raise some much needed money very quickly, Deuce becomes a prostitute. And encounters every misfortune possible.Sounds funny, doesn't it? And in the hands of some genuinely talented writers and directors, yes, it damn well could have been. But it's handled so terribly, so clumsy, so over-the-top, the humor dies out quickly and at the end, we lose faith and trust in summer gross-out comedies. And we desperately need those, don't you agree?There's a running joke involving a hard-ass police detective named Chuck Fowler (William Forsythe) who's more or less an unfunny comic take on Tommy Lee Jones in The Fugitive. David Alan Grier made his work in 3 Strikes, but having him constantly show his penis to Deuce (which is apparently pathetically small. Or at least thin) is just not funny because no one here seems to know how to make it work. Schneider and co-writer Harris Goldberg (D3 The Mighty Ducks, I'll Be Home For Christmas) incorporate a butt-load of funny ideas into this script, but no one here seems to know how to make it work.Director Mike Mitchell does not have the Midas touch when it comes to comedy. Gold, hell, he can't even settle for a bronze PLATING.Everything is so obnoxious, so gross, so overplayed, it'll give you a headache.It wouldn't be fair for me to say that there's no laughs to be had throughout the whole movie and it was totally without ANY merit Oded Fehr is perfectly cast as the experienced smoldering prostitute. And Arija Bareikis is appealing as the love interest. And Schnider occasionally (early on) does deliver a chuckle with his performance.There's a funny bit where an aquarium salesman appears to be either gay or a pervert and continuously makes double-ententes to Duece's confusion. And comedian actor Edddie Griffin (of whom my mother is a huge fan of) gets some of the movie's only laughs (belly-laughs) as a pimp named T.J.T.J.I prefer to be called a male madame. Wait, that didn't sound right. He gets (probably) the movie's biggest laugh when he explains the prostitute food chain to Deuce, using Antoine's fish to illustrate his point.And there are some really funny moments to be had early on and with some of the women Deuce services. Hey, you think the kind of MEN who pay for it are scary. Just imagine the kind of WOMEN who'd have to pay for it. But the movie stops trying less than halfway through and feels like it's on auto-pilot. Not just the director, but everything.Look, I'm gonna say it right here, right now Schnieder is just not a leading man, pure and simple. He does not have the looks, the height, the physique and charisma to carry a whole picture.Even though it seems like this is the kind of lead that's perfect for Schnieder (an ugly, goofy, sexually-repellent man who could never get it for free, let alone be able to charge for it), he just can't quite pull this one off. Although this material (which he's partially responsible for could've derailed anyone).Even if this one contained the best cast in the world, how much good can it do when you're working from a script you found in a condemned, rotting, stinking gas-station men's room on the urine-soaked floor? Look, Rob Schneider is just not the lead, pure and simple. He's the one joke character (You con dew eeet!) and a supporting actor (Judge Dredd, Home Alone 2 Lost in New York, Surf Ninjas and Knock Off). He's just not a head-liner, pure and simple. Co-billing, maybe, MAYBE. He should stop writing movies... or at least stop trying to carry them. Maybe a ensemble vehicle would help.Schnieder was never meant to be an Oscar-contender, I know. But a box-office darling? Now Sandler, I can see, but...Seriously, really... avoid this one. For good gross-out summer comedies, I recommend the following Dumb & Dumber, Kingpin, There's Something About Mary, Scary Movie and the American Pie trilogy.

He wakes up one morning, looks himself in the mirror and says What if I acted like an animal?. Than he makes a movie about that. Next time What if I acted like a teenager girl?. A movie. And so on.This maybe wouldn't necessarily be a bad way to make movies, only if the humor in them wouldn't be so obvious or bad. In this one, Schneider is supposed to be a gigolo. And it is funny, because he looks like a schmuck, and it's funny that a schmuck is trying to be a gigolo. See? Laughing already? And his character is named Bigalow. And it sounds like gigolo. Man, this is some prime material here!If Rob chose to stick to slapstick humor and an occasional weird joke, maybe this movie would be passable. But after a so-so convoluted introduction where we see why he's actually trying to be a gigolo, the movie sinks to the very bottom of the low-brow humor. It looked like they had to shoot the movie in one week, so they threw in whatever they could come up with in short notice. So Rob dates a fat black chick, a tall chick with glandular problems, a chick that shouts profanities uncontrollably, a chick with a ravaging dog and so on. Now throw in a detective who is on Rob's case and has a tendency to complain about his dick problems (and keeps showing the aforementioned extremity to Rob), a black pimp who calls Rob man-bitch all the time, and you have a movie. All this maybe looks funny on paper, but the execution is horrible.I have nothing against making fun of people's disabilities, if it's not downright insulting. A deaf person can be funny, a blind also, but only if the jokes with them are right. Rob Schneider thinks it's funny that a blind girl strokes a mop instead of a cat. Schneider thinks that pretty girls with appendage legs can't get a date and need their friends to provide them with man-hookers. Great work, Rob.All in all, this movie could be funny if you are under 15, or stoned, or preferably both. Otherwise, skip it.

In fact, you might wonder, what the hell are you doing watching this mainstream high-concept adolescent puffery, Mr. Pretentious? Sick and lazy and it happened to be on TV, that's why. And every once in a while, ya gotta sort of clear the palate, as the saying goes; like, every once in while I have to drink a crappy American lager in between all the fancy Belgian ale I drink, just to be reminded...Of how bad it gets. I didn't laugh one time during this piece of garbage; in fact, I don't think I cracked a smile once. I didn't expect to like it that much, but it managed to fall below even my very low expectations; some of it may just be a matter of taste, and I never liked Rob Schneider, never liked him very much on SNL and haven't ever been tempted to watch any of his other movies.Schneider plays the title character, whose name seems chosen to evoke Ace Ventura and also to rhyme with gigolo. That's a problem right away unless I missed something, the name is never explained; who the hell is named Deuce, and have you ever seen the last name Bigalow? This might seem nitpicking, except that this attempt at comedy betrays at every turn one of the cardinal rules of the genre give the audience something and someone to identify with. It's hard to think of any successful comedies that don't have at least one everyman and at least a couple of believable set pieces for anarchy and comedic distractions to revolve around. This film has none of that; every character from Deuce down to the most minor, and nearly every scene seems to exist outside of reality as well. The most extreme example is probably that of William Forsythe's cop character who pulls out his penis for no plausible reason every time he runs into Deuce.The plot certainly doesn't help matters; loser aquarium cleaner Deuce plays man whore for three weeks to raise money to clean up super-gigolo Antoine's fab seaside pad after Deuce accidentally messes it up while goofing around despite Antoine's repeated admonitions of painful death should the place not look perfect on his return (Deuce was supposed to look after it). He goes out with a succession of loser women who all for some reason end up liking him, raises money last minute, keeps from going to jail when we find out that he didn't actually f&&k any of these women (and this is one of the stupidest plot points in the movie...it comes out of left field and just serves to try to make us like the guy when there has been no reason to at all up to this point). Oh, and of course he falls in love with, and attains the least-deformed, most beautiful of his Jills. The humor is uniformly sub-sophomoric and offensive; the film is filled with an array of disabled and ethnic characters who are entirely defined by their stereotypes and who never become people despite Deuce's apparent inner sweetness and attempts to make friends with them. The word manwhore seems designed for a big laugh every time it is spoken...but after twenty times, it's pretty damn old.This is clearly not a film designed for me, though I question the taste of ANYONE who claims to like it; another proof if one were needed that the adolescent/teen-oriented gross-out comedy is the most pathetic example we have of the denigration of commercial American film.

There, I said it. He and Adam Sandler(who gets by on similar humor, but does better due to him looking as much as a child as he acts like) have been making these juvenile crude comedies for a while... I haven't bothered to count, and don't expect me to be part of the group of people grieving them when they stop. I don't see any creativity or thought put into any of their films, really, and this one is no exception. All of the gags and jokes are based on sex, bodily functions and/or fluids and crude sound effects. Come on, have a little imagination, will you? There's also one or two uninspired spoofs of popular movies. The plot is ridiculous, and is of the same type as several of Sandler/Schneider other films... the destroyed-something-important-have-to-fix-it-in-time type. Hmmm... isn't that just like another popular form of entertainment? Oh yeah, Donald Duck cartoons. Please, that plot had been done to death several decades before this was even a fart-joke in the scriptwriter's/producer's/whoever-the-hell-thought-up-this-movie's mind. The pacing is bad. The film is just basically dull and bland. The acting is nothing special. The characters are all one-note jokes, clichés and stereotypes. The humor is, as I've already said, juvenile, childish and predictable. I will be very surprised if anyone who has seen this hadn't figured out what would happen in every scene at the very beginning of it. Unlike The Animal, this doesn't have any comedic talent to make it easier to sit through(though Eddie Griffin is usually funny, he's just lame here) and no attractive leading lady(come on, Kate was as bland as they come). The only reason I can think of for sparing this film as much as a glance are the scenes in which Bree Turner's character dips her white T-shirt unwittingly in water, rendering it see-through. Apart from that, this has nothing to offer. At all. I recommend this to fans of Adam Sandler and Rob Schneider, as those are the only ones who'll find this entertaining. 5/10 "},{"Title":"this is the last movie that we let the guys at school pick","Date":"26 March 2004","Score":"1 out of 4 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Romance","Review":"  I wasn't all that thrilled about seeing this movie, but I thought I would at least get a few laughs, especially since we were seeing it with a large group.

Simple enough. Maybe I lack a sense of humor, or maybe this movie wasn't made for me, but I really had a hard time watching it. It was cheesy, dumb and dull. Best comedy of 1999? Not hardly, that award goes to Election, which is 1000 times funnier than this piece of junk.Possible spoilerBasic storyline, some loser becomes a house sitter for a male hooker after his fish become sick. After the loser breaks a bunch of stuff, he ends up having to become a hooker himself to pay for the damage. At this point even the least intelligent can figure out what will happen. Plus some cop keeps dropping his pants in front of the loser-hero, whatever he is, and is probably the least funniest thing I have scene in a comedy.End spoiler.I'm so glad I didn't pay to see this movie, otherwise, I would have felt ripped off. My advice Don't watch it. If you like Adam Sandler and Tom Green, you will love this flick. If you prefer stuff that's funny, like Election and Wag the Dog, don't bother with this flick.

Each character has his/her own joke, and they repeat it every time they appear on screen. Often, the jokes are at the expense of handicaps and there is one character who you are supposed to laugh at because of the gay overtones. Wow, what FUNNY stuff.Although bad, DBMG is by no means awful. If you can see this movie for $2 or less, I would imagine that you will be very happy with this movie.

An inkling. A particle. A klutzy idiot ruins the house of a famous, upper-class gigolo, and has to raise the money to fix it by prostituting himself. With weeks of tweaking and rewrites, and a much better actor, this could possibly have been funny (maybe, for example, if Deuce had to actually assume the identity of the gigolo). But that obviously didn't happen.Instead, it's just a series of stupid scenes involving women who have some weird problem. Haha, this woman is fat. Haha, this woman has Tourette's (swearing = funny). Haha, this woman has a prosthetic leg. Oh, haha, now they are parodying The Matrix for no reason at all. I can't imagine the amount of alcohol it would take for any of this crap to be considered funny.There is ONE scene that's at least smirk-worthy, with an aquarium salesman who for some reason speaks only in sexual innuendos. Normally that would be pretty stupid, but it's like comic gold compared to the rest of this movie.I'm actually ashamed of myself for watching this. For those users going, But it's not supposed to be taken seriously; it's just mindless entertainment, you people are the reason garbage like this keeps being made. Stop laughing, you idiots.
