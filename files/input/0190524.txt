And considering that I used a free coupon to rent it, that's saying something.However, I must point out that I'm not objecting to the Biblical content. Viewed simply as a fictional text, there's nothing wrong with the Bible; this is a fictional movie, so I don't have a problem per se with the content (although IMHO it makes it more fantasy than science fiction).No, the problem with Left Behind is just that the movie totally fails to excite. The plot dawdles along at a painful pace for far too long, and even I figured out the Rapture part about ten minutes into it (I didn't initially believe that they would try and use that as the REAL explanation, but I wasn't exactly shocked when they did).The story is not internally self consistent. We're told about a world wide hunger problem, but we're never shown this (all of the cast seem well fed, for example). We're expected to believe that the population of the planet buys the idea that some mysterious form of radiation has selectively wiped out millions of people in a wide spread area with no particular pattern (they wouldn't, especially considering that some of the world's top scientists are unlikely to have been chosen). Basically, given the situation at the START of the movie we should see a very different society - one on the edge of survival, with martial law and even open warfare (and we don't; America looks pretty much the same as it always does in Hollywood). AFTER the rapture, it should be even worse - and yes, we see a few signs that things are breaking down, but it's still largely business as usual.Finally, the story doesn't have an ending. Apparently there's a sequel, but that doesn't excuse the lack of a finale in this movie. To all intents and purposes, they figure out what's going on and then ... it ends. No confrontation. No pay-off. Just the main character finally realising the truth of what the viewer noticed hours ago.I've certainly seen worse movies, of course, but if you happen to see a copy of this on the store shelves, even at weekly prices... you would do best to simply let it remain Left Behind.

That being said, I think Left Behind is one of the worst films I've seen in some time.To have a good movie, you need to have a well-written screenplay. Left Behind fell woefully short on this. For one thing, it radically deviates from the book. Sometimes this is done to condense a 400-page novel down to a two-hour film, but in this film I saw changes that made no sense whatsoever.Another thing, there is zero character development. When characters in the story get saved (I won't say who), the book makes it clear that it's a long, soul-searching process. In the film it's quick and artificial. The book is written decently enough where people like Rayford Steele, Buck Williams and Hattie Durham seem real, but in the movie scenarios are consistently given the quick treatment without anything substantial. In another scene where one character gets angry about being left behind (again, I won't say who), it seems artificial.I realize as a Christian it's unedifying for me to say I disliked this film, but I can't in a good conscience recommend a film that I feel was horribly done. Perhaps it would've been better to make the first book into 2-3 films. Either way, Christians need to realize that to be taken seriously as filmmakers, we need to start by putting together a film in a quality way. I realize a lot of effort probably went into Left Behind, but that's the way I see it.

While I realize there is a 3rd movie out that I haven't seen yet, I'll review under the original title...Just from the standpoint of production value, screen writing, and movie making, this movie fails on many levels, though it succeeds on a few as well. What can you expect from a low-budget, B movie? Not much, and it works from the standpoint of production. However, the writing is certainly disjointed, with little in the way of character development...exactly what I'd expect when there is an agenda to a film. I didn't have a problem with the acting...the cast is solid; however, the screenplay in both movies gives the actors little opportunity to really stretch themselves. Because the film is Christian, this is predictable, as you can't very well portray violent chaos of the end times without also breaking some of the ethics which are normally associated with Christianity. In other words, the mistake comes in making this into a G-rated film when the content, even in the most conservative of Bible interpretations, would be R-rated by any measure. So, if the purpose of the movie is to scare people into Christian faith, then the movie should be somewhat scary, right? However, you can't comment on a film adaptation from a book without commenting on the book, or in this case, series of books. There are certainly plenty of Christian materials worthy enough to be made into movies...but not the Left Behind series...and these movies ultimately fail because, while being best-sellers, they are poorly written novels based on bad theology.As a Southern Baptist minister, I confess that the books were a guilty pleasure for me, though I have yet to finish the last two books of the series. I have described them as decent fiction, and if the books would take the point of view that this is one possibility or interpretation of the subject of biblical eschatology (study of the end times), then I could live with that. However, this series is divisive in Christian circles because it promotes the literalist interpretation of all Scripture above a more proper hermeneutic. Inevitably, this leads to the pre-trib, pre-millenial dispensation point of view, which confines an all-powerful God far too by humanity's world. In other words, as I've always said, God shouldn't need our helicopters and bombs to do his ultimate work. But because many people, particularly unstudied Christians, can't think beyond their own world-views, we are left with a pro-conservative, fundamentalist stance with regard to Bible interpretation, and attempts to push it through as the only interpretation.Thus, the books carry with them an agenda, not so much to get the lost to understand their need for Christ, but to state that the fundamentalist point of view is the only valid way to understand the Bible. I recall very clearly reading (several years ago) in the second novel a scene where the characters reference a person who was left behind BECAUSE of his non-adherence to this point of view; as if real christians worthy to be raptured couldn't possibly hold to another eschatology. This is disturbing for several reasons, the least of which is because a rapture is only briefly mentioned in Scripture and it's connection to real, end-time prophecy is tenuous at best.But the real issue with these books is comes in the way they divide the Christian community and how they portray true Christian behavior. Ultimately, I feel they harden more people to an otherwise legitimate faith/religion instead of win people towards it. It turns all Christians into caricatures, equally disdained and laughed at by the world despite the fact that there is theological room for a wide diversity of believes within Christian thought and practice. As a Christian body, on the whole, we've done enough of that kind of damage to society over 2000 years of history...and we certainly don't need to promote it by film to thousands, maybe millions of others.Thus, the Left Behind movies fail because the Left Behind books aren't worthy to be interpreted into movies.

RIDICULOUS! Poor direction. The reveal of people missing should have been terrifying, but it was laughable. They leave their clothes on the ground? It reminded me of old Ed Wood movies Oh my God!

Borrowing a line from Roger Ebert, I hated, hated, hated this movie. I have seen over 2000 movies in my life and I think I may rank this one dead last. No matter what category you choose, this movie is an inferior product. The acting is below the quality of most TV dramas. Never once did I believe in the characters as people rather than as actors being put through their paces. There is one scene where a young woman hugs her father with the same emotion as if she were hugging a telephone pole. The acting is so wooden that one is inclined to avert his eyes. The special effects were primitive, even by 1950 standards. I was hoping to be entertained by the science fiction aspects of this movie, but being disappointed understates my reaction. The main event of the story is the rapture - where all the good people are simultaneously taken to heaven by Jesus. In fact the good people do disappear about a quarter of the way into the film, but not once do we get to see an actual disappearance. We just see clothes left behind. I always thought the idea was that people's souls ascended to heaven while the body was left behind. But in this movie it appears that Jesus wants naked bodies in heaven. Big opportunities were missed by not allowing us to see the immediate effects of people being yanked off the planet - cars crashing, planes going down, dishes clattering to the floor, surgeries stopped in mid-stream, nuclear power plants going unmanned, dogs unleashed on their walks, and so forth. We see none of this actually happening. At best we get shots of the aftermath, like a multi-car accident, or passengers in a plane trying to figure out what happened. All the interesting stuff is left out and all we see is some obviously staged after effect shots. The only reasons I can think of for this are either a lack of imagination or a limited budget. The music is unremarkable - some generic rock music (a transparent attempt to appeal to a younger audience) and a few swelling crescendos to accompany the experiencing the awe of God scenes. But the worst thing about this movie is the horrendous screenplay. The script could have been written in a way to engage us in honest thought as to what constitutes a good life - the ultimate moral question. But, judging from the people who are taken in the rapture in this movie, it seems that the only good people are the devout Christians and children. This does not seem to me to be realistic. For one thing, based on my recollections of childhood, I recall an amazing number of acts of undisguised meanness. Should all children be given a free pass to heaven? And most of the people left behind seemed like pretty decent sorts to me - I would liked to have had more information as to just why they were left behind. We are given no first-hand knowledge of the people who were taken, so it is hard to compare their qualifications for being taken with those who are left behind. And one has to question the beneficence of a God who would, through an act of supposed kindness, cause such chaos and grief on earth - a loving mother ripped from her family, children taken, planes crashing, cars crashing, communication broken down, and so forth. The ultimate message seems to be turn to the Bible, family, and God. Is this message something we have never heard before? It is hard to know who this movie is aimed at. I guess for Christians the sermon delivered here is an affirmation of their faith, but for non-Christians this is a sermon they have endured ad nauseam. Give your money to your favorite charity, don't give it in support of such worthless nonsense as Left Behind. If this commentary can save one person from seeing this movie, then the time I have spent writing it will not have been spent in vain.

I have read the book several times, and the movie somehow does not capture much of what the book conveys.  Maybe it is time constraints that come with making a movie within, say, 90 minutes to 2 hours.  But this movie seems rushed somehow.  It did not let certain plotlines develop.  In the book, Rayford only lusted after the stewardess, where in the movie, it seemed like it went a bit beyond that.  Also, early in the movie, it seemed that Buck Williams already had a relationship with the Steele Family before the Rapture where it did not germinate until towards the end of the Left Behind book.Maybe it was because of the low budget and time constraints.  I remember when Kirk Cameron was fired up about doing the movie after reading the book.  The funny thing is that this movie was produced without paying any attention to the details that made this book such a best seller.  The basic idea behind the novel held true to the movie, but many key elements in the book were ignored.My advice  Read the novel series, see the movie if you must for comparison's sake, not as a viable substitute to the novel.

The characters' conversions to Christianity had the proper emotional impact, and while some might tire of basically hearing God is the answer, to nearly every question the characters have post-rapture, you have to keep in mind that Christians really do believe that God can help you out of any problem.The movie is very true to the book. While leaving out minor details, it includes many of the prominent aspects of the book's apocalyptic nature, giving it an air of realism.

I'd always been obsessed and fasinated with the Book of Revelations.  I loved the way it ran and how shockingly true it was.  Some people don't realize that what takes place in this movie will actually happen.  I'm not hear to preach so I'll stop now.  I watched Left Behind and I loved it.  The movie was powerful and it was true to the Bible.  I'd never known that there was a series of books until one day I was in school and I saw the second book.  I read it and everyone after it.  That was a total of eight books at the time.  I'd never read the first one.  I'd assumed that it was close to the movie.  My curiosity got the best of me eventually and I read the first book.  Afterwards, I hated the movie.  It followed the same basic story and plot but it lacked certain characters and scenes that were crucial to the book.  They changed certain characters jobs and even made mistakes in casting.  I would recommend this movie to someone who has never read the book but if you're a die hard fan like myself, you'll hate it.

It's difficult, even unfair sometimes but it's awfully hard not to especially if the books are phenomenal successes or classics or even just a book that is one of your personal favorites. For me...the Left Behind Series of books (12 of them in total) were drop dead amazing. I was riveted for the year it took me to read them. I am now a huge fan of the series and I couldn't help but see the films. I had a lot to go on being such a fan of the books but I also know that the books AND the films are not for everyone!!! First of all..non Christians are going to be overtly critical, especially if they go into it expected a science fiction, End Of Days type movie event. This film is based on something that millions BELIEVE is truth so you have to take that into consideration. First of all for me personally I was blown away by Left Behind.Director Vic Sarin is no stranger to film making. He has worked in films for the last 4 decades at least. He has done pretty much everything so he is definitely a veteran film maker. I don't know if he had any contact with the original book by Jerry Jenkins and Tim LaHaye but his casting choices were dead on for the most part and I stand by that. Kirk Cameron is the exception but I won't say he's bad. In fact he's quite good in the lead role of Cameron Buck Williams. Granted he's not quite as gritty, or street smart as his book counterpart but he's decent and considering that Cameron is more than directly responsible for the creation of this film at all. Relative newcomer Janaya Stephens plays a strong headed and take charge Chloe Steele and does a good job. The real brilliant casting is in the role of leading man Captain Rayford Steele who was such a huge hero in the book. Brad Johnson puts a face to that role and does a great job doing that. I don't even credit his acting necessarily but his look nails Rayford's personality and his acting is alright too. The other person is the anti-Christ himself Nicolae Carpathia played by Gordon Currie, a character actor who's been around for a long time. He is brilliant as both the charismatic caring leader and the dark, evil being he is to become.The story is very closely linked to the book and they did a good job of transferring book to screen and leaving the most important details in tact and only changing small details. I have heard complaints about this not being an original concept with typical government conspiracy and hit men and yadda yadda yadda well...first off NEWSFLASH nothing is an original concept anymore, it doesn't stop people from seeing it. In fact it seems that more than half the films released now are not only not original but direct rehashes of original films or series. I happen to think Left Behind The Movie puts a new spin on the Christian theory and does it excellently. The budget is low but still managed to pull off some intense action scenes, there are definite moments when the acting borderlines on campy but they are all not mainstream big actors and actresses and they do their best to make it real. The plot is actually quite complex and intriguing when you really watch. The whole concept of the anti-Christ killing his parents which was brought up in films like The Omen and End Of Days is changed completely to have Carpathia murdering his parent figures, the men who created him politically. The final scene in the film is disturbing and memorable with a powerful performance by both Cameron and Currie.The average person I can understand giving this a poor score...I could even understand someone being bored with it. It has it's moments. I think for me it's just a personal thing that I loved it and I loved the books and I hope they continue making the films. What I don't like is people nit picking it and saying how crappy it is simply because of it's basis in Christian faith. Grow up!! and open your mind, even if you don't believe it, you might be entertained. It's worth seeing and I know it's a cult classic so I'm not the the only one!! 8.5/10 (For most probably a 5/10 but I still encourage reading the book and watching the movie...it's got a lot to offer) "},{"Title":"God Awful Movie Based On A God Awful Book about a God Awful God","Date":"6 May 2010","Score":"6 out of 11 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Drama, Fantasy","Review":" Left behind is based on the first book of the popular bestselling series about the end of the world as told in the bible. When I first heard the words apocalypse, end times, good vs. evil and Anti-Christ my first thought were of books and films like the Omen or The stand by Steven King. What I got in the book was badly written fundamentalist fear based propaganda. The film is not much different from my experiences with the book.The story stars Kirk Cameron (The kid from growing pains) as tough guy reporter Buck Williams and Brand Johnson as polite Rayford Steel who cheating on his overly Christian wife. It begins with Kirk reporting in Israel as the nation is about to be attacked by the Russians. The Russians? Some one's trapped in the cold war days. Anyway there reasons for waging war is for fertilizer. You read that right. They risk world war 3 for Fertilizer. Doom seem to be unavoidable as badly done CGI planes fly over the holy land but at the last seconded a strange force destroys all the planes. Killing all those men who dared anger God by joining the Russian air force. Then we moves into the to the true holy land. America! Ware we meet Brad Johnson character. His wife has become a born again Christian which seems to have caused trouble in the family. In the film they betray it as the family is having a hard time accepting what she has to preach (Believe me, there will be preaching in this film) but in real life it would more likely be along the lines that people cant stand having some one ells trying to enforce religion down our Throats.She throwing there son a Christian themed birthday party, Poor kid, but that no good sinning non-believing father of there has to go to work and fly a plane. As he dose this he is having a little romance with the flight attendant. Non-right winged Christian Characters go on to be betrayed like this in the books and the films. The true believers in Christianity are betrayed as happy, good and moral. Those who do not are portrayed as immoral, unhappy, angry, or even naive.He flys his plane that happens to have Kirk on it when half the passengers disappear only leaving behind there cloths. In one night all born again evangelical Christian who believed the bible is the literal truth and Jesus is the only way to heaven disappear along with all children under 12 years old. Planes with out pilots crash, cars with no drivers pile up on the streets causing a massive death toll to rise and parents mourn for the lost of there missing children. You think a loving God who cares for humanity would at least take people when they were not driving or flying anything that could get people killed! So thousands of people are killed in cars and plane crashs then sent to hell forever because they did not accept the God who just got them killed in the first place. As the story moves on our heroes discover that people were rapture in to heaven and now it's up to those who were left behind to convert the rest of the world to Christianity and battle the Anti-Christ.Okay. One thing I usually cant stand in movies is when I am being preached at and Left behind the most preachy film I have ever seen in my life. Get prepared for endless lectures from the Characters about how great God and Jesus are, How the bible the only truth and that it some how not God's fault that people are going to the hell he made for not being Christian. All the born again Christian characters are uninteresting and charters who were more complexes become uninteresting the moment they convert to Jesus.The acting and casting is just bad. I can't really get myself to believe that Kick Cameron is a big tough reporter. The guys still looks like the kid from Growing Pains. The movie is just the beginning of films that are all motivated to promote fear and some bigotry to those who don't buy into this particular brand of Christianity. Ideas promoted in left behind are the reason why we have problems in place like the mid-east to begin with. The simply message of love all as you love your self that Jesus taught is replace with a message that benefit mega churches and politicians.To top it all off we can't even have decent acting, realistic characters and good special effects.

No.  The movie is delivering the same message as the six o'clock news<<The world is a scary place.

What then?It is an interesting question. As it stands now, we have films that are made for profit. Most of these pander in some way. Then we have films that are made as art.

Then instead of massive protests against a respectful film like 'Last Temptation' (shots were fired here!) what will we get? Imagine class war.The film and the books behind it aren't very biblically accurate in any case. The rapture metaphor comes from Darius, who incidentally rebuilt the temple the first time, and invented modern Judaism as an experiment. Currency has been unified since then, 2500 years with only the names kept nationally. That's what is referenced in the B. Darius also revived Zoroastrianism which mixed with later Judaism to produce the essenism of John which Jesus adopted.This in fact is not a film with Christian theology at all.

Kirk Cameron stars as journalist Buck Williams, a passenger on a plane when the mysterious disappearances occur. Brad Johnson plays the pilot, Janaya Stephens his daughter and Chelsea Noble (Kirk's wife) as a hot flight attendant. Gordon Currie co-stars as an up-and-coming world leader, Daniel Pilon as a wealthy banker and Clarence Gilyard Jr. as a left-behind minister. TD Jakes has a good cameo.Most readers know this, but the story is based on prophetic accounts of end-time events from the Bible. I have studied eschatology (end-times prophecies) and do advocate the pre-Tribulation Rapture based on scriptures like 1 Thessalonians 413-18 and Luke 1724,34-35, which doesn't mean, of course, that I agree with every jot and tittle of the theology featured in the movie. It doesn't matter, however, because it's a fictional story. In any case, you don't have to believe in the Bible whatsoever to enter into the story of the characters and enjoy the movie for what it is &#x96; a What if the Rapture really happened mystery/thriller. I don't believe in powerful androids that time-travel from the future, but that doesn't prevent me from enjoying the Terminator flicks.The more-mainstream 2014 version with Nicolas Cage severely truncated the story, focusing only on the first three chapters of the book, which involve the airplane coming back home after the vanishings, plus cutting-&-pasting the romance of Buck & Chloe from later in the book to the beginning of the movie. This didn't make it bad, although uber-fans of the book likely object to the smaller focus. Regardless, the 2014 version worked for me simply as a survival/mystery story. By focusing on one family and one airplane & two passengers, it drives its point home without being convoluted and awkwardly preachy. The two strong male protagonists and two female co-stars are a plus. Furthermore, the plot is amazing because how else would you describe a situation where millions of people, including all children, suddenly vanish with only their clothes left behind? It would be an incredible experience, to say the least, not to mention a serious wake-up call for those remaining. So the 2014 movie is effective as a What if? survival/mystery and set-up for sequels (which will never happen because it failed at the box office).This 2000 version with Kirk Cameron is much more ambitious even though it cost significantly less and is 15-minutes shorter. Incredibly, the screenwriters were able to cut out the fat and cram most of the book into 95 minutes without seeming overly convoluted, although much of the first act might be a little complicated to people who haven't read the book. The CGI effects appear near the beginning with an air-attack over Israel and they're noticeably weak (the aircrafts look like blurs in the sky). But the score is quite good and the story is compelling with believable characters and well-done prayer/ministry sequences, which aren't easy to pull-off. Lastly, they didn't do too bad with the Antichrist element.The film was shot in Israel, Missouri, Chicago and Toronto.GRADE B "},{"Title":"It's Best to Approach This As A Work Of Fiction","Date":"13 October 2015","Score":"","Genre":"Action, Drama, Fantasy","Review":" I've been a Christian for nearly fifty years, and as I do not happen to believe in the pre-tribulation Rapture, approaching this movie as a work of fiction seemed wise. And as it turned out, I enjoyed it more than I thought I would.As storytelling goes, it isn't half bad, and the acting is serviceable and even touches the heart or chills the bones at times. By now even those who have never seen it (and wouldn't if you paid them) probably know the basic plot the Rapture, which is basically the sudden disappearance from the face of the earth of everyone who was right with God (meaning of course the sort of Christian who reads the Bible as if it were a Dick and Jane reading primer), leaving behind friends and loved ones to muddle about in confusion until they figure it out for themselves.The principle players are reporter Buck Williams (Kirk Cameron), airline pilot Rayford Steele (Brad Johnson), Steele's daughter Chloe (Janaya Stephens), and the Reverend Bruce Barnes (Clarence Gilyard), the obligatory minister who finds himself left behind and thus forced to face up to his inadequacies as a man of God.There's nothing inspired in the casting; the characters are stock and the actors inhabit them surprisingly well, Johnson especially (his grief when he comes home and discovers that his wife and son are among those taken is one of the more genuine moments in the whole picture).Since this is taken from the novel by Tim LaHaye, a proponent of the pre-tribulation Rapture, we all know what comes next the tribulation and the rise of the Antichrist. It's all muddled up with a man in Israel attempting to combat world hunger and the move towards a single world currency (which is never explained; Christians who follow this theology have this particular theory about money but how it ties in to the return of Christ they can never really satisfactorily say). In addition, the nations of the world are declaring peace, which is a good thing, right? Not on your life. It takes a while to find it out but what this world peace really means is that there is no God so no need for any of the religions of the world.The United Nations takes a real beating in this movie; it is painfully obvious that the people who wrote this thing suffer from a xenophobia so deeply ingrained that anyone who does not look, speak, walk, or think as they do is at the very least suspicious and probably headed for the lake of fire.As for the Antichrist, this is where the movie slips, and slips badly. He arrives in the form of Nicolae Carpathia (Gordon Currie), a rather blank-faced man with a pronounced Russian accent. (Well of COURSE it would be Russian; remember those damn Commies??) The scenes in which Currie appears are the silliest ones in the film and frankly he comes across as comic relief most of the time.The film doesn't really end; the credits just roll.

No, we're actually laughing at them because of how poorly acted and staged they are.

This film directed by Vic Sarin is the first of the Left Behind trilogy that was followed by Left Behind II Tribulation Force and Left Behind World at War.Rayford Steele is an airline pilot whose marriage is on the rocks after her wife has decided to spend most of her time in the church.This resulted in an affair with a fellow stewardess,Hattie.In their flight towards London,a number of their passengers disappear for no apparent reason and a number of chaotic events happen in the world.We also meet other characters along the way such as Buck Williams, a television journalist, is pondering the rash of sudden disappearances as he works on a report about Dr. Chaim Rosenzweig, an Israeli scientist who has devised a formula that would make any soil on earth easy to cultivate. Too bad that this movie resulted into becoming a poor one.Instead of trying to send the message of the coming apocalyptic events such as the end of the world,its poor writing and performances resulted into unintended ridiculous film-making due to poor writing,dialogues between characters and performances from the actors.Too bad that a Christian movie like this imparts messages that is far from what Jesus thought his follower and the Biblical scripture-based events that would happen as stated in the Book of Revelations turned out to become an unintended action thriller.A better remake was tried last year but it only resulted to worse film instead of a better film adaptation.

Even though I'm not religious, a decent movie about the rapture is possible.But this film is far too boring to be decent.

You feel nothing. You also feel absolutely no urgency, the panic doesn't feel real. And it's the frigging' rapture.

Jenkins novel, but I have suffered through the movie, and it is abysmal! Left Behind concerns the Rapture, or when Christians are called to Heaven by God. Amateurish tripe at best, this risible, one-dimensional, religious saga strictly preaches to the choir, with performances as lackluster as the subject matter is bland. You'd think that an epic about Biblical prophecy dealing with Armegeddon would pack more punch, but it barely registers. Kirk Cameron of Growing Pains fame toplines a forgettable cast as a globe-trotting journalist with GNN (Global News Network)who starts out covering a miracle in the Israeli desert where crops are growing. Suddenly, the Iraqi Air Force launches the surprise attack on the Israelis, only to endure abject defeat. Brad Johnson is the one actor here who seems to know what he is doing, but this is far and away one of his least memorable turns. The rapture scene itself is hilarious nonsense. During a jet-ride on a 747, a mature lady asks our stalwart hero Buck Williams (Kirk Cameron)to check the lavatory to see if her husband is in there. Next to her on the seat once occupied by her spouse is a crumpled suit and tie without a body to fill it up. Johnson is cast as a philandering pilot who wishes that he had paid more attention to his wife when she took up church-going. Meantime, Buck and two girls--one of whom puffs away on a coffin nail, track down a conspiracy with the villainous Nicolae Carpathia (Gordon Currie) out to control the world. Partition  director Vil Sarin generates little momentum in this sluggish tale and none of the leads conjure up an ounce of charisma. This low-budget release appeared initially as a straight-to-video movie with little to recommend it. Ironically, even some Christians have blasted it for the nonsense that it is. Left Behind has no conviction.

After watching 45 minutes of this film I noticed that it was almost entirely composed of people sitting at home and doing nothing... literally nothing. I had enough of watching basically nothing and so I hit fast forward and being a VHS tape I could basically see everything that was going on. after countless scenes of people still sitting at home doing nothing and occasionally looking at bibles or going to church or doing other boring things, I finally got to something that was sort of interesting and started watching. I had almost entirely forgotten how bad the acting was. It seemed whenever they tried to make a scene dramatic or intense they would drag it on forever until it just kind of became boring and meaningless. before I knew it I was glancing anxiously at the fast forward button until I couldn't take it any more. Literally the moment I reached for it though, the credits started rolling and despite being completely unfulfilled by the story, I felt entirely satisfied that it was over. I don't want to keep this movie on the shelf anymore for fear that someone might think I have the kind of taste in movies that would make this film bearable... maybe masochist or something.

Just when it looks like Israel is doomed as a nation the attacking jets mysteriously explode in mid-air. And as luck would have it Buck is able to get the whole thing on film. Not long afterward he boards an airplane and during the course of the flight passengers suddenly disappear off of it. It soon becomes apparent that this is not an isolated occurrence as millions of people all over the world have also disappeared without a trace. Now, what has just transpired is an event dubbed by certain fundamentalist Christians as the Rapture. What soon follows is a hell-on-earth scenario called the Tribulation. At least that is what some Christians believe is going to happen. Anyway, as far as movies pertaining to this specific subject I believe that this is one of the best. What I liked about it was that it did more than just adhere to the book&#x97;it put life into it. In that regard, the people in casting did an incredible job of assigning the right actors to play certain characters. Specifically, Brad Johnson (as the pilot Rayford Steele), Gordon Currie (as Nicolae Carpathia), Chelsea Noble (Hattie Durham), Janaya Stephens (Chloe Steele) and of course the afore-mentioned Kirk Cameron. You probably have to have read the book to fully understand how perfect these actors fit their roles. Now, that is not to say that the acting was all that great because it clearly wasn't. Likewise, those who don't agree with or understand the views of this specific sect of Christianity probably won't fully appreciate the nuances of this film either. Personally, I don't necessarily agree with some of these interpretations. Additionally, although I read the book I didn't think it was well-written at all. If anything I thought the characters in the book were rather dull and hollow. And that's the reason I thought the actors in this film invigorated it so much. But that's probably just me. In any case, this film is not about science-fiction. It's a film about Biblical prophecy which was intended for a certain segment of Christianity and doubles as an evangelical message to everyone else. That being the case, I think to fully appreciate this movie a person has to have a little understanding of what it's all about. Above average.

The film, based upon the phenomenally successful book (and series) of the same name, had a lot to work with, but clearly the budget wasn't up to the challenge of adapting the source novel with complete success. It's obvious from the battle scenes at the outset that special effects aren't going to be the movie's strength, and as the film goes on other weaknesses appear the script is uneven, clearly struggling with regards to which elements from the novel to bring to the table, and moreover the acting, though quite good from some quarters, is of highly variable quality. The soundtrack is annoying to boot, often veering wildly off into bad pop confections that do nothing but distract from the drama.Despite its undeniable weaknesses, I think that overall Left Behind is a respectable film that is worth a watch, especially for fans of the original book. Kirk Cameron is solid in the lead, and does a lot to carry the picture through its rough patches. The script may not be well balanced, but the underlying message of the Gospel is still there. The romantic element between Buck and Chloe is surprisingly effective, though subtle, and in the end the evil embodied in the antichrist and the awful reality of the fate to which he is steering the whole planet is conveyed with a certain amount of malevolent resonance.There is no question it would have been nice to see a superior film version of the extremely popular Left Behind novel, but in reality this is not quite the cinematic disaster it could have been. Indeed, in balance, Left Behind the movie successfully overcomes many--not all, but many--of its inherent flaws.

Most End-of-time films tend to be big budget,lots of CGI disaster epics that help the audience endure the all-too-often feeble script and plot. Not here. Moreover, we hear of these massive disappearances around the entire planet. No word that the traditional hierarchical churches have been affected. One would think that the sudden disappearance of the clergy of the Orothodox, Catholic and Anglican churches might tip people off, if even atheists. Or perhaps this is a Fundamentalist production and all those organizations are evil and damned. Be it far from me to judge... Anyway, the acting is rather bland (Mr. Cameron does not really project the depth of panic that end times should naturally invoke in even the staunchest unbeliever), and the various plot holes make no sense. Spoiler ALERT  for example, we have the Israeli biologist who has created a new strain of wheat which shall alleviate world hunger; as a reward the AntiChrist character Nikolai Carpathia shows him a plan for the rebuilding of the Temple in Jerusalem. When it is pointed out that the Arabs will never allow it, he calmly states that when their children start dying from hunger they will allow it. Only problem is ALL children worldwide have been raptured by this time. There are no kids left anywhere. Apparently there are several more installations to this series, but I will not be forfeiting any more time on them.

Anyone who has read the Book of Revelation (And I wouldn't advise it. It's very dark and depressing), it contains a vision of the world at it's very worst. It describes events as being a nightmare of war, pestilence, disease, human rights abuses, economic collapse, famine, natural and man-made catastrophe on a global scale--suffering that there is no escape for anyone from. It even speaks of people having to indulge in cannibalism to survive. While some of these kinds of events are taking place now and have happened in the past, the Book of Revelation speaks of a world where just about every aspect or system of society and civilization just breaks down all at once. It's a world no one could really imagine as they are events that have never occurred that way, all at once, in human history. There's no common frame of reference to compare it to. Sorry, I'm not trying to make everyone depressed or anything. It's just that this series of movies (and there are a couple other religious produced end of world type movies that have the same kinds of flaws as Left Behind) fails to touch the level of pain and despair that just about everyone would be experiencing in a real Biblical Apocalypse. Everyone in the movie just seems to be so much in control and pretty well behaved. They aren't confused, in despair or spiritually lost or suffering in a real, deep or profound way. They basically make the right decisions and pretty much remain on the right road. Their choices are between right and wrong where I feel that many choices in those circumstances would be between wrong and less wrong. It also doesn't depict the various ways in which society has fallen apart, the series of tragedies happening to people around the world, the riots, war, disease, etc. that would be happening. It doesn't depict the horror and terror. I suppose making a movie that could grasp the events in the Book of Revelation may just be an impossibility but there are alternative movies that may not be based on Biblical prophesy but are able to grasp the kind of pain people would be in much better. Movies like The Road, Blindess or Contagion come closer. Even shows like The Walking Dead do a much better job at touching on how people truly behave and what their experience would be in a more real believable way. Left Behind also has it's own born-again Christian agenda which I don't mind too much but it gets heavy handed, arrogant, self-righteous and preachy in spots. I would never say to someone, 'Don't bother watching this movie.', just don't expect too much from it unless you are looking for a false sense of security.

The book was Graven Image by RF Hawthorne, whom I have not met.I hadn't paid any attention to this sort of story -- stories that tie in current events with ancient prophecy concerning end times -- until I read this draft copy of Hawthorne's novel.Left Behind provides some answers as to what may be expected if millions of people are lifted up or transfigured off the face of the planet, prior to prophetic-pending mortal catastrophe on earth.  Graven Image, and the reason for my piqued interest, gives the actual details as to how that is going to occur -- based on actual historic and biblical research, which incidently is not touched on in the movie, that is, details as to how graven images play in end times events and modern-day bio-medical developments, because those details had not yet  emerged -- until Hawthorne's book.Anyone who watches Left Behind must take it that one step further and read Hawthorne's piece, who incidently has a website by his author name, which I would certainly encourage readers to check out.As for me, Ladymoontv is very interested in developing the screenplay to Hawthorne's work for indie development in the future.

Suddenly, without warning, dozens of passengers simply vanish into thin air. But it doesn't stop there. It soon becomes clear that millions of people are missing from around the world. As chaos and anarchy engulf the world, both men set out on vastly different paths in a desperate search for answers, according to the DVD sleeve's synopsis.Like Mr. Cameron says, There's no denying The Truth. If you were deaf and blind, you would, still, find that this movie stinks to high heaven. Anyone but a true believer in the theological perspective presented has a right to be offended. So, it's better to seek redeeming qualities in other ways. The performances, as a whole, aren't inspired - but, they are, at least, serviceable. It's nice to see Colin Fox at work, and Gordon Currie makes a good impression. Left Behind cannot be saved, however.For what it's worth, the story could be engaging - but, as soon as it gets moderately interesting, it's over. How can a Christian God terrorize these non-believers? How is it that neither He nor the Anti-Christ are able to detect Kirk Cameron's goodness? Perhaps, God doesn't save Cameron after his epiphany in the toilet because He has a plan for Cameron? Perhaps, the Anti-Christ is keeping knowledge regarding Cameron's true feelings secret? Perhaps, a sequel in in the offering?

It's a talky book that reads like a cross between a young adult adventure novel and a bad romance novel. I had hoped for a ten cent potboiler, but I wanted something more racy and exciting--something motivated by real lunatic zeal. The guiding purpose of the authors instead seemed to be to make the book as long (and implausible) as possible.But all of those gripes are gone with Left Behind The Movie! The screenwriters brutally streamlined the story, and even went so far as to give every action a motivation. They also heavily modernize the story--a flaw that had only been apparent to me in the book by the 1930s serial-style character names (Rayford Steele, Bruce Barnes). On seeing the movie, I realize now how ridiculous it was for the main character, Buck Williams, to be a world famous PRINT journalist. In the movie, he's a cable TV anchor, and it makes a lot more sense.The speeches of the Antichrist were also rewritten for the screen, which makes his appearances much more plausible and dramatic.This movie turns out to be everything I wished Left Behind was. It's just good exploitation trash with lots of pay-off. MULTIPLE characters get turned on to Christ, in much the same way as characters in other exploitation films get turned onto reefer or lesbianism. There's even a moderately high body count.

I'm talking about four people, Kirk Cameron, Brad Johnson, Clarence Gilyard, and Janaya Stephens who apparently out of all the people left on earth after the Rapture has occurred, have figured out who the anti-Christ is and what his intentions are.There's a whole lot of theological debate out there as to whether the Rapture will even occur. But what that's supposed to be is at a given point all the true believing Christians and most of the children on this planet will all of a sudden vanish. What's happened is that God's taken them into heaven so they will avoid the coming events of the very last days on the planet.For some reason these four have been Left Behind, but they've figured out what's going on. And the anti-Christ is none other than the Secretary-General of the United Nations. A guy named Karpathy who has a mittel-Europa accent popular in Hollywood films in the Thirties. The actor who plays him, Gordon Currie, does the best job in the film.Brad Johnson and Janaya Stephens are father and daughter. His wife and son are among the raptured. Daughter is a rebellious college kid and Brad's been having an affair with stewardess Chelsea Noble. Brad's a pilot and he's heroic in a Jack Armstrong kind of way. Why a believing pastor like Clarence Gilyard's been left behind is a mystery to me, it surely isn't explained in the film. And Kirk Cameron just does not cut it as a cynical investigative reporter. Maybe I'm unfair, but I still see him as the kid from Growing Pains.There's a problem with these kind of films as I see it besides the obvious one of that this is only one interpretation of what the last days will be like. Internationalism of any kind has always been an enemy to fundamentalism. The North American continent has NAFTA the European nations bind closer together from the Common Market up to the creation of the Euro Dollar, things like that are seen as evil.Maybe I don't get it, but I always think that the more people talk the less likely they will fight. That's a good thing in my book. But if you think your belief system is the only true one in the world, you resist all forms of dialog. That's the logic behind this film and it's also the logic Al Queda operates with for their faith. I've always thought that the Bible story that is the most insidious is the Tower of Babel. All people speaking a common language, working on a common goal even if it is to build a gigantic stratospheric tower. So God messes up languages to keep mankind forever apart. And as they come together, evil is supposed to happen.I think the planet as a whole as more to fear from those left out as opposed to those left behind.

Instead, we get strong acting by actors who feel strongly about their beliefs. The end result, a powerful film made to inform the public as well as entertaining them. This movie was all fine and good until I stayed after to watch the after credit section where Kirk Cameron talked to the audience about what they wanted to do with the video version of the movie. Coming across as somewhat of a friendly salesman and the anti-Christ, Kirk Cameron treated the film as a giant platform to get the movie Left Behind scene in the movie theaters nationwide. While everyone will have their own opinion about the quality of Left Behind and its overall messages, it is far from a great movie. It is, like much of Cloud Ten Productions, a meaningful film that falls very short of a blockbuster as an amazing film.

While the books do manage to remain faithful to scripture, their methods of fulfilling prophecy are often ridiculous (an example is their explanation for the Russian/Arab invasion of Israel). Also, the books have an unmistakable preachy tone that will turn off unbelievers rather than bring them to the gospel. Still, I found myself reading these books because of my interest in the events of Revelation. For a similar reason, I watched this film adaptation. I am sad to say that it is a rather mediocre film bordering on poor. The acting is actually rather decent for the most part with occasional bits of poor acting and over-acting. The script is rather bad, though it is hardly unexpected when starting with the novel as a basis. The characters are poorly drawn and underdeveloped. Events feel scattered and disconnected. The dialogue sometimes sounds rushed. At least the book managed to flesh out its hokey conspiracy theory. Here, the viewer is left with an incoherent mess that only makes much sense if one has read the book. The pacing of the film is also very poorly executed with the opening and conclusion seeming extremely rushed, and the middle dragging to an excruciatingly slow trudge that makes it feel padded. The music is schizophrenic. At times, it successfully underscores the mood and sounds fitting for a motion picture. At other moments, it reminds me of sitcom and mini-series music. And still other bits remind me of a poppy MTV soundtrack that just doesn't belong in the film. I can give the film points for the scene of panic on board the plane, but that's it. The other scenes involving the disasters after the Rapture are far from compelling. The film also suffers from the book's preachiness although its message isn't quite as in your face. In all, I found the movie just as disappointing as the series. This is not the film to rally Christians around it. I hope that this film does NOT get any attention at the theaters next year. It would be more unnecessary bad publicity for Christianity. For an example of a compelling, intelligent, well-researched series based on Revelation that presents a realistic and Christian world view without offending the secular reader (who after all should be whom a Christian is trying to reach) read the Christ Clone trilogy by James BeauSeigneur.

And first impressions tend to be very important, so having such a poor start really didn't help the movie out much.As it continued, the movie actually did a decent job of creating suspense and interest, but it was very detached from reality. Interest in the events being shown was more like being interested in some sort of extravagant and mythical fairy-tale, than any sort of current event or issue.But then nearer the end, when the religious overtones became much more than overtones, when the plot really hit nonsensical (although it is pretty difficult to become more nonsensical than millions of people vanishing for no apparent reason), that is when it really lost it. Of course, I won't get into detail about what those events are -- as that would spoil it for you, the reader.The other huge strike against this movie, is that it was definitely trying to put forth some important message.

Sadly, I don't know that anyone (aside from the most strongly religious Christian follower) is really going to get much from this film. If anything, it has only perhaps hurt the 'cause' of the writer and filmmakers, as it has shed a less-than-appealing light on strongly religious Christians (IMO). I only hope the folks going door to door selling their religion have a better way of conveying their message than this film did, because if not then I really don't know how they expect to attract any more followers.

Then, for some lame reason, the Rapture occurs and all the good people vanish. All the unfaithful, or bad people are now LEFT BEHIND. Is that heavy handed or what? Among those LEFT BEHIND are Cameron (TV must be evil), Brad Johnson as an airline pilot and his daughter, and a grab-bag of regular sinners. They discover they truth in the bible, and find out why they've been LEFT BEHIND. Then there's some nonsense about a temple in Israel.

I enjoyed the choices for actors in the movie, they fit the physical images in the books, but the quality wasn't spectacular. For those of you disappointed in the movie, try the books.

Rayford Steele is a pilot with a Christian wife (whom he is cheating on) taking a plane to London.  Suddenly, millions of people all over the world, including Rayford's wife, vanish out of their clothes, and Buck's investigation leads his path to cross Steele.Yet another interpretation of the Rapture and Book of Revelation.  Unlike Apocalypse, I knew who the Antichrist was immediatly (I have not read the novel) since he appeared immediatly after the Rapture and not before it, like in Apocalypse where the Antichrist's identidy came as a suprise.Some of the acting is a little second rate, some is very second rate. Christians should look for T. D. Jakes of TBN, as Pastor Billings, but I personally found it more interesting watching Jack Van Impe in Apocalypse and it's sequels. The opening special effects are sad, and probably the best in the entire film is the car explosion, very early ninties type.Now, I'm not wholly critizing the film.  The storytelling is interesting, and the plot is fairly intruiging.  The ending leaves a place open for the sequel, which will be a TV series.  The Antichrist's corny accent is slightly annoying, but the character is chilling (though not as chilling as the Antichrist in the sequels to Apocalypse).In short, it could have been better, but there are those worse than it. One is Years of the Beast but a dead ringer is The Omega Code. When you've got a few hours free, and you're not in too great a mood, you could give it a shot.

Vic Sarin directed a movie entitled COLD COMFORT, a paranoid cabin-fever movie that put MISERY to shame.  But I guess work is hard to come by these days.  I know it's a shame to sell out, but could you at least try?Script - Where?  Stating that the script is bad implies that someone actually cared enough to create one.  But this hackneyed, obvious, cliche'd, festering bag of limp dialogue makes me long for the hard-hitting, bone-crunching dialogue of THREE'S COMPANY, which had an improbable premise, but was handled with far more tact and skill than LEFT BEHIND's 'script'.POINT - None.  Actually, that's not quite true.  How about, Everyone who doesn't believe in our point of view is going to hell?  That about sums it up.  I'd accuse the movie of being racist, but that might be seen as actually having an opinion that cements my place in hell.RESULT - Awful.  Rent THE RAPTURE, starring Mimi Rogers.

God's Army managed to be informative and entertaining because it avoided those traps.  Left Behind, based upon the book, unfortunately invests so much time on the Biblical foretelling of the end of the world and the return of the Anti-Christ that only ardent believers would understand the significance of what transpires in the film.  As such, the average moviegoer is about one step behind the confusing events that are only explained later.  Take the State of Israel about to be annihilated by circling warplanes only to be magically saved.  Or people who vanish with only their clothes as reminders, or the restoration of the Temple of Israel, or the Eden project, or a worldwide conspiracy to control food, or the selected biblical references that trace mankind's demise.  The concurrent theme of wayward people who find Christ in the midst of their dilemmas isn't enough to offset an assumption of biblical knowledge the filmmakers expect.  There is also this dangerous implication that since only the devout have left, those remaining must redeem themselves in some way to be saved.  Does that mean that the outstanding Jewish leader in the story and all others like him aren't going to be saved? Or are they really part of the conspiracy?  Perhaps it was asking too much for the filmmakers to frame Left Behind in any other way than what is presented.  After seeing the in your face approach of Dogma and the blatantly irreligious The Rapture, and the slyly romanticized Ellen Burstyn film, Resurrection,  moviegoers clearly needed a more balance presentation of Christ.  Left Behind however made more sense to a limited audience than it did to a wider one that either didn't know about the literal Apocalypse or weren't going to buy into it anyway.

But as far as movies go it's somewhere between The Stand and though I havn't seen it yet perhaps The Omega Code.  Nor have I read the Left Behind book series.  This was a movie my dad bought for my mother and though I thought it lame of course, I always watch a movie I havn't watched thats just come out on vhs or dvd (especially dvd) So when this DVD comes into the house it's just inevitable that I'll watch it.  This I did and here I am. (Spoilers included though if you read the bible (whatever version) you'll get the general idea.)In the obvious turn that this will be a movie series, this movie doesn't have the type of ending you will want.  But some really great movies don't. (Ghost in The Shell)  It's a good try at being a movie, but it has alot of items that make it more of a TV Movie than something out of Hollywood.  I do like what they are trying to do with this movie, by releasing it on video, they hope to get people interested enuf that they'll go Feb 2, 2001 and in some form of a protest against the most violent of movies with so called little family values.  (Pulp Fiction) The core reason being that Hollywood makes these movies (as they've said) because it's what the people want.  So if enough people go to Left Behind, Hollywood might take notice.  They have an uphill battle to make. I might go myself just to show my support in one hell of a great idea.  But it's a battle I'm not sure if they can win.  I better movie for instance would help.  They included all the enticements, VIOLENCE, people being shot in the head, affairs being committed.  Which would be why so many were being left behind.  It's not a horror movie as THE STAND is but it's interesting.  It has some well known actors.  It's hard to think Kirk Cameron is in this type of movie, and then Brad Johnson I believe, best known as the kewl dude from (Always). The DVD contains several previews of movies very similar.  We've got Gary Busey of all people (who was in drag in Under Seige)and Mr. T in another.  My biggest problem is the actors themselves and it's hard to watch supposedly Christian movies with folks who act.  Act in movies totally opposite to these types of movies.

What person living in the US doesn't know the message?  It didn't need to be preached at us every minute, that only turns off the exact people this story is meant to minister to.  When will the Christian film community learn that in order to reach a secular audience they need to do quality productions, not watered down TV movie stuff.  This movie hits theaters Feb. 2nd and I predict it will do well at first, as church goers attend it at their pastor's urging.

Even though the movie is only an hour and half, the movie is packed with action, right from the very start. Planes overhead, explosions, good looking women-what more can you ask for in a movie!  This certainly is not one of the normal, boring, and usually horribly acted Christian movies that I have seen.  Kirk Cameron and Brad Johnson led this cast with superb performances as Buck Williams and Rayford Steele.  The two characters battle with the spirituality they know and come to find something bigger and better.  And yet they end up trapped in the middle of good and evil every time.  Perhaps one of the best casting moves this movie has made was that of Gordon Currie as Nicholae Carpathia. Currie portrays the Anti-Christ character as he will be when he really comes-as a great, likable, and all around generous man.  One doesn't realize his true identity until the end of the film.Amazingly enough, this movie is a great adaptation of the book, and follows very closely with what happened in it.  Had the viewer never read the book, however, the movie would have been just as good, if not better.  The characters are masterfully developed; bringing out who they truly are and watching them change as the movie progresses.  The plot twists, the hidden personalities of the characters, their conversions are all unforeseen when the movie begins.  Knowing nothing about the Biblical story or the Left Behind series would even further express the point that this movie is trying to get across.The cinematography, directed by Peter and Paul Lalonde, rivals that of some Hollywood producers.  The use of different camera angles, colors, lighting, and overall direction is astounding, drawing the viewer into the film simply with how the film appears.  If you are thinking about seeing this movie a second time, please do.  After watching a second time, I realized that I liked the movie even more than the first.  To be honest, I wasn't too impressed the first time around, but maybe me expectations were too high. I was able to catch many of the special production tricks that the Lalondes added to spice up this movie.Left Behind is a must-see, whether a Christian or not, this film will spark your interest and most likely leave you with many questions (and a burning desire to see what happens next) but you will also find yourself happy that you spent the money to see a great movie.

The first of the current 'End of the World' films was 'The Omega Code', featuring Caspar Van Dien as a reporter involved with a charismatic leader (Michael York), who was actually the Antichrist; in 'Left Behind', the reporter is Kirk Cameron, with the leader portrayed by Gordon Currie. Both films feature 'main stream' casts, better-than-average production values (although the FX are bargain basement, at times), and a moral that says that although even worse times are coming, God will prevail (as opposed to Hollywood's earlier Antichrist films, 'The Omen', and 'Rosemary's Baby', for example) that put Satan on top, at films' end. Where 'Left Behind' and 'The Omega Code' differ is the interpretation of when the Rapture, the Biblical-predicted ascension to Heaven of the faithful, will occur. 'The Omega Code' implies that the Antichrist will already be in place, and world events already twisting to his purpose, when the devout will disappear. 'Left Behind' follows the majority Christian opinion, that the devout will leave before the seven-year Tribulation (rule of the Antichrist) begins. In following this interpretation, the Rapture serves as a Stephen King-like opening to 'Left Behind', and provides a 'hook' that the rest of the film plays off of.One of the things that struck me as interesting about 'Left Behind' was that, as children, our church hammered into us, again and again, to accept Christ and AVOID missing the Rapture, and being left behind, at all costs! 'Left Behind' on the other hand, says, in effect, 'Hey, most of us will miss the boat, so let's face the worst of times with faith'. This may be a more honest way of seeing things, but it still feels uncomfortable!The story focuses on pilot Brad Johnson, a career-motivated married pilot with a girlfriend on the side, who has no time to listen to his wife's Christian message (guess which one goes to Heaven in the Rapture?), and reporter Kirk Cameron (looking VERY young!), a international reporter who witnesses first-hand the Biblical prophecies being fulfilled, yet searches for human explanations for events. Both men must reexamine their lives, and discover for themselves God's purpose.Don't expect a neat and tidy resolution to 'Left Behind'! The first of a four-film saga of the Tribulation, the story serves primarily to introduce characters, place the Antichrist as the Ruler of the Earth, and show that no human can stop or even slow down his ascent. Only faith and the love of God will help those 'left behind' to survive, elements that they lacked prior to the Rapture, but that they must embrace despite the price in suffering they will have to pay, if they want any chance of salvation!For non-Christians, this message may seem fanciful, and the story second-rate Ludlum; for those who do follow Christ, 'Left Behind' is intended as a 'Wake-Up Call', not as well-done as it might have been, but powerful, nonetheless! Is it great cinema? Not really, but it is better than the standard 'religious' film, and deserves respect for attempting to buck the 'typical' Hollywood product, with a message which may be quite timely!

The writing is good, though not great, but the story is so compelling that I find myself reading 200 pages each time I sit down to read.Left Behind The Movie widens the gap between the great story, and the mediocre writing and directing used to convey it to the audience. While the film certainly has some exciting moments - most of the time they are accompanied with either silly dialogue or stilted acting that unfortunately distract the viewer from what's really going on.The acting is either great or terrible, depending on who you're referring to. Kirk Cameron is great as Cameron Williams, and Janaya Stephens is excellent as Chloe Steele. Other performances are adequate, such as Brad Johnson's Captain Rayford Steele, and Chelsea Noble's Hattie Durham. Unfortunately, a couple of the performances were just plain awful. Gordon Currie was completely unconvincing as Nicolae Carpathia, especially in the few scenes that really were important in his character's development. He looked way to young to play the part, and he made Carpathia into a stiff and boring leader, completely opposite of his charismatic presence in the books.However, Currie's performance looks like Oscar material compared to the awful portrayal of Bruce Barnes by Clarence Gilyard Jr.  Bruce's lamentation at the church after the disappearances is easily the worst few minutes of the movie. To be fair though, Gilyard's lines are easily the worst of the script. Emotions that could have been conveyed with a slow zoom in to a teary eyed and broken man were instead explained literally by Bruce himself. It would have been less distracting for the film to just stop and ask everyone to turn to page 135.That brings up another problem I had with the film - it seems to assume that the viewer has read the book. Nicolae's presence as a political leader is never explained, and his rise to power is depicted in only about two minutes. Some of the most compelling scenes in the book are those that allow us to learn more about this mysterious leader. These moments are glaringly absent from the movie.The last thing that I have to mention is the music. The music is by far the worst thing about Left Behind. The choice of music for one of the most significant scenes in the movie made me roll my eyes in disbelief. What should have been the most moving scene of the movie is marred by the fading in of some cheesy Christian pop song.Overall, the story is still good enough to keep the movie going. However, the problems listed above sadly keep a good movie from being a great one. I gave it a 5 out of 10. "},{"Title":"I really tried...

And Left Behind is just as narrow-minded as the series is.And what does Left Behind teach us? It teaches us that a loving god (or Jenkins' LaHaye's interpretation of God) selects only a handful of people who profess allegiance to one specific denomination of one specific religion to join him in paradise. Not only that, but at a specific point in time, he magically whisks them all away no matter what they're doing, also causing a number of accidents which undoubtedly whisk all of the unsaved people killed in said accidents straight to Hell. Warms the heart to a boil, doesn't it? Oh, but we're not finished yet. There's this guy named Nicolae Carpathia who begins his own rise to power against said god. We're not supposed to know that he's the Antichrist yet, but come on... they may well have tattooed 666 on his forehead. The only thing that can stop him? Kirk Crocoduck Cameron.But the worst is yet to come. Not only is Left Behind a dark orgy of religious fanaticism, but it's outright plagiarism. Yes, that's right... it's plagiarism, and I'm not referring to the Bible. Left Behind plagiarizes Stephen King's The Langoliers so blatantly at the beginning that I'm surprised nobody else ever caught this. People disappearing suddenly on a plane, leaving behind clothes, belongings, surgical implants, etc.? You can't tell me that Jenkins and LaHaye just coincidentally thought of the very same thing. King should have sued them. So much for originality, huh guys?My critique is not against Christianity, nor against any religion in general. What it is against is a movie which uses fear and on screen violence to frighten people into converting to an extremely narrow-minded point of view, and isn't even done well in the first place. If you're someone who believes that every single word of the Bible - a book that has been translated and mistranslated throughout centuries and is filled with countless contradictions - to somehow still be 110% accurate, then this is probably the movie for you. If, on the other hand, you want an entertaining storyline about the rise of the Antichrist (and one that doesn't paint God as a genocidal monster), watch the Omen series instead. Don't give Jenkins or LaHaye the credit and money they don't deserve.

I almost hesitate even to comment on this tripe, which is not worthy of my attention but unfortunately has captivated that of tens of millions of illiterate American born-again Christians. I picked up the first book in the grocery store and attempted to read the first page or two; alas, Tim LaHaye is a ghastly writer. But that only makes this production more puzzling I would have expected that LaHaye's sheer lack of literary talent, enormous financial success and noted Romophobia would have been enough to have Hollywood producers fighting and clawing to produce a professional-looking film adaptation.Not so, I'm afraid. Hollywood apparently hates born-again Christians even more than it hates traditional Christians. Still, one is amused to hear the critics charging that this promotes a fundamentalist, conservative or even reactionary interpretation of the Apocalypse. This is part of the reason I condescended to write this review. Something needs to be cleared up this moment there is nothing conservative about the theology peddled in this franchise. Prior to the 19th century, most Christians, including conservatives, understood Tribulation as persecution, the Millennium as the long age after the Council of Nicaea, and Israel after the New Testament as the CHURCH, *not* a literal nation!Catholic views of the Whore of Babylon and the anti-Christ vary widely, ranging from everything to the Roman Empire and the Emperor to anyone preaching false doctrine to St. Robert Bellarmine's belief in an evil emperor in Jerusalem, an outrageous modification of which influenced pre-millennial thought. For their part, traditional Protestants have never believed the Whore of Babylon would be the United Nations or the anti-Christ would be its chairman; these titles were respectively and perpetually held, in their view, by the Catholic Church and the Pope. A few Eastern Orthodox and a few others suggest a resurgent Ottoman Empire or perhaps even Peter the Great of Russia.Really, though, almost any imaginable interpretation would have made for a far more engrossing story than the at best selectively literal interpretation of the Apocalypse posited by the Dispensational Premillennialist Covenant theologians of LaHaye's school. Let's say all of a sudden a percentage of the world's population vanishes before everyone's eyes. (I'll resist the temptation to crack a tasteless joke about the idea that born-again Christians might all disappear someday.) There are always sceptics who attempt to explain everything away, but for about 80 percent of the world's population this would surely be crowning proof of the Blackstonian interpretation of the Apocalypse. Why don't we see far more instant conversions than we do here?There are, of course, other problems with this movie there is talk of a horrendously turbulent world, and yet we never see it. There are the actors, if they can be called such. There is the amateurish film-making. Above all there is the uncritical praise given by so many born-again Christians, some of whom go so far as to celebrate, even encourage and instigate, increasing geopolitical turbulence (often centered around the Middle East and the Holy Land) and believing it is their Divine duty to accelerate the return of Christ. Did Our Lord not specifically admonish that It is not for you to know the hour?This is a bad movie, based on bad source material, but it does not fall under the banner of a conservative Christian film by any standard, and the people clinging to its disastrous theology have little recognisable share of the magnificent 2,000 year legacy of this Faith. By their fruits ye shall know them, we are told, and this is the best they can come up with. Avoid at all costs.

Would it not make more sense to make the message interesting to those who supposedly need to hear it? I've never read any of the Left Behind books, but, based on what I've heard about them, it would seem to me that the authors have little conception of how international conflict manifests.There are four core things that really sink this film; 1) director Vic Sarin has little concept of the larger story being told, 2) whoever shot this was uninspired for the project, 3) there is a distinct lack of vision for the film, and, finally, 4) the plot is silly and stupid.For a film that's supposed to tell of what would become the opening stages of the final battle on Earth between God and God's enemies, this thing is highly sanitized. Then again it is meant for a Christian audience, even though same said folks want to spread their message, but nevermind. The film didn't need huge amounts of swearing, nor pornographic gore to show the horrors of God's former right-hand angel as he wages war on Earth, but I felt like I was reading the Highlights Version of the Civil War. Or in this case a supposed future civil war.On top of that, there's a real disconnect between what the Carpathea character is supposed to be, and what he's able to do on terra-firma as a human being with demonic DNA. If he's so invulnerable, and otherwise unassailable, then why in the world does he need a following to wage war against the Almighty? Why does he need a lear jet to get around the globe? Why have any Earthly implements at all? How did he get born? But again, nevermind.A film about biblical apocalypse needs some grounding. But this thing is so wrapped up in being marketed to fundamentalists that it loses the larger audience that it was trying to garnish. Video game quality CGI effects in the opening sequence should be a real clue to the would be viewer. And trying to pass off rural North America for Jerusalem seems to have been done more for budgetary considerations than anything else.At best this film is a curiosity. If you want to see what kind of a film a director of Indian decent can make for fundamentalist Christian backers (including Barnes and Noble), then give it a whirl. Otherwise, if you must see some fire-and-brimstone on your TV, then do yourself a favor and rent or buy Chuck Heston's The Ten Commandments--from an era when Hollywood knew how to make these kinds of flicks.

So I did. I haven't read the books and didn't know of it's existence before yesterday. My roommate gave me also the two sequels, so I knew during the watching of the film that there was more.Overall, I found this movie to be disappointing. There were such good story arcs that ain't been used, or were turned into a boring movie. I liked the first 10 and last 10 minutes, but not the in between part. Let me explain.First of all, I like the idea of the movie the book of revelations has come true. Quite some people are taken to heaven, but what about those who are left behind? What will happen to them?My impression of the beginning was good the attack on Israel was nicely done. Maybe not the most cutting-edge sfx, but it worked for me, I was impressed it was better than I expected. It is even good that you, as viewer, don't know at the moment who is attacking. You are just as confused as the Israeli's. But what is irritating, is that after that hot moment, it isn't made clear who attacked. Like that's irrelevant! You would think it would be the Muslim nations around Israel, but the film doesn't confirm it. The only mention I saw, was 'an attack from the north', which should come from the book of revelations (haven't looked it up). That could mean anything, even Russia.The first minutes there is also some nice dialog between the pilot and his family. My favorite quote (it may not be literal, doing it from memory)Steele (the pilot) to his son, whose birthday he is going to miss due to work 'I'll take a palace for you from London.' son 'Could you also take a sword? And a spear, to put a head on?' shocked mom 'Where did you learn that?' son 'On Sunday school!'The pilot doesn't spend enough time with his family, has a lover on his plane, his son and wife will be taken in the rapture and he has a fight with his daughter these are good ingredients for some drama. It seems to go that way, Until he becomes a Christian. Then he is suddenly mister nice guy, and loses all the faults that make his character interesting. it would really be better for the movie if he becomes a good Christian at the end...And also take his daughter Chloe. She criticizes her dad, points out the double morale, makes cutting remarks, she is a critical note Until she becomes a Christian. Then she loses her sharpness and all her character thereafter can do, is smile. What made her character interesting, her critics, is gone after she came to believe.And take the main character Buck Williams, the reporter. He searches for the truth, and wants to stop the evil from happen when he learns about the bankers. Until he becomes a Christian. He finds out that there is an even greater evil, and instead of trying to stop it, he even assists it to come into place by being passive. He seemed to have lost his fighting spirit and just watches the Antichrist to make all his moves in front of him. He even doesn't attempt to stop him.At a certain moment in the movie, people are shown a video from a priest from three years earlier, where he foretells all that is going to happen. The moment this is introduced, it is already too late. It would be better to start with that priest recording that video, during the first minute or so, and then switch to the attack on Israel. It would make it more interesting, and this message won't fall from the sky.During the movie, I was really bored. I understand that the coming to believe is an important theme, but why make it so BORING? It is really possible to convey the message and make an interesting movie, even without budget!I must say that I do liked the end. Knowing that there were more movies, I didn't mind the open ending. The film ends with the Antichrist getting into power, in a scene that is nicely done. This Nicolae turns out to be the most interesting character from the movie he starts out as a puppet, and ends up as an evil leader. This makes you like him most of the characters. That couldn't be the purpose of this movie... A Christian movie where the viewer is guided to like the Antichrist best? O man...To summarize- The begin of the movie is promising and Nicolae's rise to power at the end is nicely done.- There is enough material for drama (Steele's family conflict, his loss, his lover; the priest who seems to lose faith; Williams' friends who are murdered one by one), but it isn't turned into drama- The idea is really cool (the book of revelations happens), but isn't presented in an interesting way.- The religious message it tries to bring, has the wrong impact! If coming to religion means it happens like in this movie, it means that in order to become Christian, you have to go through a very boring process in which you lose your ability to criticize, you won't act against evil and you can't understand anymore that someone is sad for losing relatives. From my roommate I know that these things are not true, so this film gives the wrong religious message!I wouldn't recommend this movie to others.

He probably meant VERSE 24, but the film makers missed this slip up.  Perhaps the worst part is that the film's eschatological position is Biblically unsound.  While many Christians have espoused the film's interpretation of end-time events, such interpretation, in *my opinion*, is faulty.

Where it comes unstuck is the execution. Seriously, it is amazing this movie was actually given a theatrical release in cinemas.The script progresses in the most atrocious manner, way too briskly at first then achingly slowly throughout the extended middle of the film. Not to mention the distracting in-your-face factual and continuity errors. The dialogue was shockingly simplistic, and the actors' delivery certainly wasn't doing it any favours. You can tell the leads - they're the ones that remain calm whilst everyone around them are in hysterics. Clever technique. And who on earth decided to cast Kirk Cameron as the lead?As I've mentioned the pacing was so far off the mark. Two-thirds of the runtime is spent on setting up the rapture, then the remainder rushed through over the last third (and we're talking some serious area to cover here). Episodic, to boot, with television commercial sized scenes. This may well be the fault of the 'bestselling novel' (as the opening title announces), but I gather several more in the series have been released, so perhaps they should have been combined for the screen adaptation. It all screams that dreaded phrase - MADE FOR TV.It's not a total lost cause, though. Te casting agents have found a surprisingly compelling face of evil in Gordon Currie. And again, the premise is indeed a fascinating one. A few observations though it's nice to see becoming a Christian REALLY means denouncing your nose-ring. And it truly would take a film made under the current American administration to paint the UN as an evil entity, and nuclear disarmament as the first step on the path to hell.

The events involved are so inherently dramatic that at some point (no one knows the hour) someone is going to mine them for a couple of decent hours of film.  Left Behind is, however, not that couple of hours.  It is instead 95 minutes (it somehow seems so much longer) of shoddy craftsmanship in virtually every aspect of filmmaking bad writing, bad direction, and some of the worst acting ever recorded on film, all aided and abetted by amateurish cinematography and special effects that -- well, to call them cheesy is actually an insult to cheesy special effects.  (That this film even exists suggests that someone -- I'm not sure who, but someone -- owes Ed Wood an apology.)Now, it's possible, of course, for all of the above to combine to produce a movie that is still enjoyable -- in spite of its flaws, or sometimes even because of them.  Left Behind isn't that movie either.  Its ineptitude is not even oddly charming in the manner of, say, Dolemite or Plan 9 from Outer Space (although there are some amusing moments of unintentional humor, many of them the result of the antichrist's truly execrable Russian accent).  In fact, for something so bad in its every aspect, the movie is oddly dull.Another reviewer very aptly observed that for a movie whose stated purpose is converting people to Christianity, it had an unsettlingly contemptuous tone with respect to non-believers.  I would suggest that the reason the movie and the books upon which it's based are so successful is that they're essentially porn for Christian fundamentalists dramatizations of a future in which they're proven right, and get to look down from heaven like the mean-spirited children in the opening credits of The Wild Bunch as the scorpions (everyone not in strict conformity with their narrow world view) are tormented in various ways.  Now, if that's what does it for you (if, that is to say, you're the type of person who's already memorized Kirk Cameron's anti-abortion rant at the conclusion of Listen to Me), then by all means buy the DVD and put it up on the shelf next to your KJV.

However, I would like to think that I am open-minded enough to enjoy a film about religious things if it is done well.  This one was not.  I was forced to watch this while at a friend's house, he no doubt having the intention that it would provoke a change in me.  It was agony, all right, but not from fear of God's wrath.  Just the agony of having to watch a worse-than-B-movie in its entirety.I know the movie is based on a best-selling novel, but if the book is this bad, then I have no idea how it sold so much, aside from religious fervor.  The plot itself is very basic.  God comes back; the unsaved remain; some of them try to do what's right and stand up to the antichrist.  However, there are so many things that stand out as glaringly stupid, I can only hope the book doesn't have them too.  The examples are too numerous to mention, but I will cite my favorite one.  An anchor for a CNN-like news network pulls some strings and gets a flight attendant hired on at the UN.  She then in about a week or so becomes the right hand man to the antichrist.  Man, that anchor has some connections, eh?There are other things that bothered me, beside the horrible acting.  Chiefly, the demographic make up of those who are left behind.  If you'll notice, those still on earth after the rapture have been none-too-subtly portrayed as breaking some assumed religious code.  Those who have lit up a cigarette, those who have unorthodox body piercings, etc.  We all know there will be none of that in Heaven.  What is more disturbing is there is only one non-white ethnic person who is carried on up into glory.  Several more African Americans remain.  Coincidence?  I'll leave that question unanswered.The bottom line is this movie-wise, Troma Pictures has produced more quality work.  As a platform for bringing about revival, it also fails miserably.  If you want your friends scared into religion, try taking them to church.  Take it from one on the outside, the movie only serves to distance non-believers more.

As usual the UN is the bad guy and millions vanish in a pre wrath rapture, yet, is this movie believeable in certain rights? First off, with all that has been written on the rapture i find it hard to believe if such a event happened no one would guess what it was. The rapture is a theological security blanket devised during the great awakening and comes from a doctrine called FUTURISM. THis doctrine claims CHRIST will return 3 times instead of once, which during there will be no second chance. The book was hard to read, and yet stereotypical in a genre that needs to change or stop all together. Yet, films like this and the OMEGA MAN can be fun. However, the merchandising for this film is boorish. This includes chrisitan dogtags for kids..let us consider the message this sends. Do we arm our children with God'sa love or of the pagan christendom doctrines of a nazish neo fascism? I do not blame the cast and crew of this, this was a job for them. a paycheck and a chance to practice their craft.

Will there still be people 100 years from now insisting that the Rapture is imminent?In a way, I almost wish that such an event would occur! What an interesting day that would be! What would be even more interesting is if the Apocalypse were to occur in a more spectacular fashion, not in the anthropological sense the authors of the Left Behind series have portrayed, but as more of a Stephen Spielberg production, with boiling clouds, trumpets, angels descending out of the sky, Moon turned to blood, the whole nine yards.

Although the messages they have tried to get across have been obvious, the filmmakers have not conveyed those messages well. This, however, is usually not their fault, as there is usually some sort of low budget handicap hindering these movies. Even keeping that in mind, the movies are not enjoyable. Left Behind, on the other hand, is.In comparison to those previously mentioned other Christian movies, Left Behind is a great effort to present the story of Revelation seriously and realistically. I have never had a chance to read any of the Left Behind books, which I have really wanted to do, so I cannot compare the movie to them. Granted, it is not a perfect 10 or anything, but I will say that it was a very well made movie. The acting was pretty good, and the special effects were, well, decent. There were only two things I really did not like about the movie. One was the writing. It was simply not written as well as it could have been. It was somewhat cliched, and there were a few groaner lines, things that people would never, ever, say in real life. The other was the music. For the most part, the soundtrack was pretty good, but why in the world did they have to start cutting through the serious music for some soft rock type music? That was simply not appropriate. Also, there were moments during which silence might have been more appropriate than any music they could have used, especially during scenes of mourning. Apart from these points, I thought the movie was pretty good. Even though it lacked technically, it is still a great improvement over its predecessors. No matter how much room there was for improvement, it must be admitted that there is an element of Left Behind that makes one think about the times to come and how to be ready for them. If you watch this movie with the right attitude, not one that wants sensory overload, but one that wants to be challenged, even if only a little, you may find something to chew on in it.

It is very well-written (although I didn't really like #2,10, or 12), and the way Tim LaHaye and Jerry B. Jenkins evokes emotions dramatically. Vic Sarin now brings the books to life. Or so they tell you.The movie does start out with what happens in the book, but it just destroys a classic scene. It's very unrealistic and the effects are very bad. The movie then abandons the book, comes up with some politically strange scenes, introduces the villain (whom you don't even know is a villain), and finally returns back to the book for the Rapture scene.The Rapture scene is easily the best Christian scene; it was so well written and didn't come off as cheesy. One problem most of this scene was taken directly from the book! Therefore, the writers did almost nothing here. But I did love the scene.More story lines become present and their are many cheesy and pointless scenes. Rayford Steele is introduced as a man struggling to find some ground after his wife disappears. In the books he is the main character and a much brighter man than he is in the films. Brad Johnson is very flat as Rayford Steele and his performance doens't weaken the film but it doesn't strengthen it. Plus they have made Buck the main character, which in the books, he is not.So what about Buck? Kirk Cameron portrays him (this guy's been in so many Christian films at this point), and I thought he had the second best performance. That isn't really saying much though, considering the fact that he rarely has a good moment as an actor. As a matter of fact, he cannot act out someone in pain.Janaya Stephens plays Chloe Steele, Rayford's daughter. She's a very B grade actor but does well with her role. However, the love story between her and Buck is so horribly written and so random that it significantly degrades her performance. Bruce Barnes (I forget the guy's name who plays him) is very cheesy and nothing like he is in the book. I didn't really like his character that much and it made the film worse than already it is.But I now have good news; Gordon Currie! Gordon Currie is a wonderful actor, beautifully matching the evilness of Nicolae. It would be hard to remake the Left Behind series without him as Nicloae Carpathia.While this film completely ravages the book and fails on many levels, there are some golden moments that really strengthen the film. The Rapture Scene, the UN showdown, and the closing scene are all very dramatic and those scenes deserve an 8.0 for being so fantastic. Gordon Currie steals the show as the ultimate bad guy of humanity.But sadly enough, neither of these two good things could do much to save the film. 4.8/10.

Undeniably good writing and interesting story. However, I didn't have very high expectations for the movie. There was no way mainstream Hollywood would have taken up a Christian series and produced a big-budget movie. So it was done independently... and it just felt like I was watching a really long TV show. It just didn't FEEL like a movie; it didn't have that movie experience to it, if anybody knows what I'm talking about. So the movie suffered because of that, and the low-budget, poor special effects were another detraction for me.On top of that, I feel that Gordon Currie was woefully miscast as Nicolie Carpathia. Reading the book, my impression of NC was that he was supposed to be this charming, dazzling, amazingly handsome guy who spoke English with almost zero trace of an accent. So I imagined somebody like Pierce Brosnan in the role. Instead, they found some Clay Aiken pencil-neck who looks like an employee of the month from Best Buy, and gave him a really bad fake accent. So that lost a few stars for me right there. A movie is just not convincing when the major villain doesn't look or sound the way he's supposed to.The acting was okay, but nothing to write home about. Some of the scenes - like one of the conversion scenes (can't remember which one) - were real seat-squirmers for me. And some of the Christian rock music or whatever it was, was really out of place for some of the scenes, like in the one with Kirk Cameron praying in the bathroom.In short, it wasn't a bad movie, but it just didn't do it for me.

I know this sort of critique borders on blasphemy, but even though the movie deals with Biblical truths, I think more consideration should be shown into developing these types of movies. It looks to me as if the producers say   Well, we put in enough Bible stuff to satisfy the Evangelicals, so they'll go and see it no matter cheaply it's done. I'm sorry. but movie goers aren't that stupid! So what's wrong with the movie? Most of the actors are well cast, but Kirk Cameron just doesn't look rugged enough to play Buck Williams. The dialogue is too hackneyed, and the direction is less than adequate. In the opening minutes, we are transported to various locales with the appropriate defining subtitles, but are given no reason why we're there while rush to another location. I also heard a lot of promises of how the movie was going to be true to the book, but it seems that the director and writers lost their nerve when it came to crucial dramatic moments. (Spoilers Ahead)Besides the Rapture itself, two key moments in the book are the personal salvation experiences of Buck and Rayford Steele. No matter your views on this subject, this transformation is necessary to change these characters' motivations for the rest of the series. In the movie, all we see is Buck mumbling some incomprehensible words in the bathroom, and Ray entering a church for the first time. We are then expected to believe that these two men have now become Christians, even though there is no clear indication of when this took place!It says a lot about a movie's entertainment value when the villain is the only good product of the movie (Remember Gary Oldman's Dr. Smith in Lost In Space?) Nicolae Carpathia's final scene in the movie is the only part that is actually well done. Instead of being disappointed by this movie, I suggest Years of the Beast, or the recent Migiddo.

This is to serve to put a fine point on the general observation that the film is porn for fundies, and sacrifices the interests of genuine moral and religious virtue to the baser goal of simply Being Right; a much easier and wider path.Look at the specific example of the character of the U.N. leader.  The script seeks to depict him in accordance with some end-time prophesy that he would be a master of deception.  How do they show this?  They show him hypmotizing people in a conference room into believing that two people he kills by his own hand actually committed suicide.Well, this is sad.  Religion should, first, shed light on everyday, practical facts about how and why people lie and distort.  But the abovementioned depiction of deception in Left Behind is tragically...well...deceptive.  If you come to expect that deception will come in the form of some supernatural power, you have been robbed of the ability to detect it in forms that are driven, not by satanic forces, but by very human interests in privilege and power.  In other words, whereas Christianity should serve to make us more enlightened, observant and sensitive people, this ostensibly Christian movie posits a pseudo-spiritual Red Herring of a dangerous nature.What we really need is a religious film that teaches people to detect bullstuff.  Instead, Left Behind teaches them that deception comes from spooky, supernatural dimensions, and that you won't have to contend with the anti-Christ simply because...if you're Christian and still on the planet, then that guy saying all those cozy, spiritually resonant things can't, by definition, be him.  So just keep on waving the flag and trusting the latest Christian-variety jackals in Washington, even when they spout whoppers so big a pet rock would cringe in revulsion.Come to think of it, I resented Enemy of the State for almost precisely the same reason; because it also drops a Red Herring.  If you believe Enemy, you'll think the essential problem is state surveillance.  But the dangerous thing isn't that they might be spying on us, it's that we walk over to our TVs, turn them on, and invite the pernicious lying creeps into our own homes of our own free wills.  We hand our brains over to these unworthies on a silver platter, free of charge, and then--in response to films like Enemy--find ourselves worrying if maybe they're spying on us.  They don't need to; they let us spy on our own damn selves!  And movies like Enemy and Left Behind are reprehensible in dropping these distinctly unspiritual Red Herrings in the paths of spiritually searching people.

Film is presumably an art form, and should be held to standards of excellence, whether the subject is a Summer Camp, the Holocaust, or the Rapture.This film sucks, plain and simple.  The dialogue is ridiculous, the acting melodramatic, (With Baby-Face Cameron and Square-Jaw the Pilot being the standouts of crap), and the special effects laughable.I read an article in Variety that the movie had a budget $510 dollars, and paid its actors their body weight in King James bibles.  Such would seem to be the case.The movie taught me two valuable lessons, though 1)  Children go to Heaven, but teenagers go to Hell. 2)  Only through the slavish devotion to an invisible man in the sky, can we be free.

The Iraqi air force appears to be larger than all of NATO's combined.

This is a criticism of how the movie does not make itself faithful to the book in many, many aspects.  It truly is a great series to read, but you wouldn't know it from the movie.In the movie, events are abbreviated so much it is hard to tell where it came from.  It severely abbreviated Hattie's obtaining a position at the UN and Carpathia's rise to power.  Yes, Williams is still a journalist, but making him a TV reporter instead of a newspaper writer throws the plot for a loop.  The death of the President, as reported on the O'Hare TV, directly contradicts the book and compromises any hope for a sequel as he plays a major role in it.  At least they kept the Steeles in Chicago.  Plus, there are errors in the general filming, not to mention credits that need a proofreader.As a movie in and of itself, it might get 8/10, but as a Christian movie in a secular market, it drops.  As a movie based on a book, it gets 6/10, and only that because the books are so good they overshadow the movie.

Kirk's real-life wife, Chelsea Noble, plays Hattie Durham.  Newcomer Janaya Stephens does an excellent job as Chloe Steele, and Brad Johnson (former Marlboro Man) as her father, Rayford.  Gordon Currie portrays a chilling Nicolae Carpathia.  But the scenes with Clarence Gilyard as Bruce Barnes, once Bruce realizes what being left behind has meant, are the most stirring of the entire movie.  His grief at remaining behind comes through with raw emotional fervor.  Watch for cameos by Christian music artists Bob Carlisle, Rebecca St. James and Clay Crosse.

This movie seems to be a highly entertaining fusion of the X-Files, any given showing of the Nightly News with Tom Brokaw, and the very best elements of Tom Clancy's novels. This film has everything one could possibly want in a film.  There are spies and informants, conspiracies, murders, cover-ups, family conflicts, high-tech espionage, greed, world-wide deception, global disasters, corrupt businessmen, political intrigue, potential supernatural occurrences, very real spiritual happenings, wars in the air and on the ground, and wars in the hearts, minds, and souls of all involved.  With all of this, this film carries THE most significant message any film could possibly deliver.In an instant, millions of people all over the world disappear off the face of the planet.  The world's babies and newborns are gone as well as men and women of all ages.  Even some teenagers have vanished.  We are first exposed to this jarring event when dozens of people disappear on an international flight piloted by Capt. Rayford Steele. To his horror, Rayford discovers that his wife and son are among those missing.  Steele's daughter, Chloe, remains though, and together the two of them (along with others who were also left behind ) search for the answers to this cataclysmic turn of events.The Left Behind novel, on which this film is faithfully based, has been heralded as the best selling novel of ALL time, so it was just a matter of time until it would be made into a film.  The novel tells a story on a global scale and makes it personal and involves the reader in a way that other books are many times unable to do.  It is a huge story and must be told in a huge way.  The real task was for Cloud Ten Pictures to tell this large-scale story with a tiny  budget of $17.4 million.  Despite the extremely restrictive budget, the Canadian film company pulled off a miracle and was able to deliver much of the punch that the novel delivered.  The scriptwriters did change some plot/character issues, but overall, the film remained quite faithful to the novel.  The only complaint  it was too short.  The filmmakers packed a lot of story in about a 100-minute film. I wish they could have been bold and given the film a longer running time to capture the full impact of the novel.  Perhaps the shoestring budget prevented them from doing so.  If that's the case, then the filmmakers are forgiven.This film has seen a limited  release on video first but is gearing up for a theatrical release on February 2, 2001.  The filmmakers wanted to get a grassroots push prior to the theatrical release to get people to see the film.  Specifically, the ones targeted for the push into the theaters are the people who have not read the novel, those not familiar with the series, people not typically interested in end of the world prophecies that are being fulfilled in today's world.  Even if you are fortunate enough to see this film on tape, see it in the theaters.  It will jump out and grab you with a power that only the big screen can provide.  Additionally, there are rumors that the theatrical release will have a different ending than presented on the video version.Rush to see this film.  The book is still the best experience, but I love the medium of film.  This is still a powerful film with the most important message a film has ever delivered.  Even if you don't agree with the message of the film, you still walk away thoroughly entertained and you will be left with images and ideas that will stay with you for a long time to come.

I was riveted by this movie. Maybe I liked it so much because I avoided watching it for nine years. But from the time I saw the planes flying over the northern border at Israel, I felt like had seen this all somewhere before. Maybe I'm one of those few atheist ex-catholics that took my bible reading way too seriously. Maybe its because I'm doing a presentation for my Spanish Conversation group on the UN this week (Naciones Unidos).I remember when I saw Rosemary's Baby, I felt the same way. I was a lot younger and still only a few years away from still being religious. I loved the Polanski movie and moved into the main characters body, just like I did in this movie. When I got home, I couldn't sleep because I was literally checking under the bed to see if the devil was there (Catholics really believe in the devil.) I doubt if I'll lose any sleep in the same way tonight, but this movie was in the top group of science fiction movies in my opinion, because it allowed me to buy in or suspend disbelief so easily.Why should I call this a science fiction movie when many don't see it that way? Because the scientist character, Rosenzweig actually invents a new style of farming. That should be science enough for anybody. This is a note of realism in that which helps the most skeptical realist to suspend disbelief.I notice that there are a lot of believers that don't like this movie. Is it possible that the director has done what is necessary to suspend disbelief for the skeptic, but not among the converted? Perhaps, but I feel sorry for anyone who needs a story to match their religious beliefs perfectly, and who can't just relax and enjoy a work of art for what it is. I have to wonder if any of these Christians like Disney movies, like Hercules. Why should every theological fantasy have to match what exactly what one knows about theology? While the pilot character (the whole family?) was a little weak, the other actors in the play were all strong. As I recalled the evil nature of the one that precedes the antichrist I was struck how this fellow was simply portrayed as an elitist capitalist was not overacted or over the top. How can so many people have missed this? I can tell you why, because they didn't study the book of Revelations in the Bible, but heard their Revelations second hand, through church sermons about rapture. Nevertheless, despite the fact that the movie is often accurate in portraying the events and characters in Revelations, the back story that supports the movie plot is really quite strong. For example, who is the GNN reporter character in the bible? It is the writer/narrator of Revelations (considered by scholars to be John).Some skeptics hate this movie because they say it contains the germs of the carping one hears about the one world government described in the Bible. However, to me there is something realistic and admirable about this idea, whether you feel comfortable with it or not. In a world which is always at war, one has to agree that a panacea can be a lot more attractive, at least subconsciously. When you see the council mollified and hypnotized at the end, you have to wonder if the GNN reporter, who now finds himself in the position of counter-spy will ever try to resist what already been accomplished. In actuality we never see him pray, only shake hands with the lately saved.Well, I've ranted long enough. I think someday someone will dust this movie off and realize it is not just a bad movie about a bad book about a biblical fantasy, but actually a good movie, perhaps the best of its genre. At least, that's the way I viewed it. "},{"Title":"Don't believe this represents reality?

In other words, one must use the same method of interpretation when reviewing this movie, as with other movies.And when it comes to interpretation, if you seriously don't think this movie represents what the Bible truly speaks about will happen soon, all you need to do is tune into your local news network. Pay attention to what happens to the nation of Israel. Your future truly does COMPLETELY depend on it.

It is like a textbook example of everything that a filmmaker shouldn't do.  I don't know where to begin when explaining its flaws.The movie starts Kirk Cameron from TV's Growing Pains as reporter Buck Williams, who works for GNN (GNN is just like CNN, but it starts with 'G'. Sorry folks, that's about as witty as this movie gets.)  While Williams is in Israel, the Islamic countries launch a massive attack for no particular reason, but almighty God smites them with a plague of cheesy visual effects.One would think that such an event would be a cause for concern, but Williams reacts as if he was watching a peewee football game.  He takes a plane home, but the rapture occurs before he arrives.  The rapture, for those who don't know, is when all good Christians will suddenly be whisked into Heaven, leaving everyone else to suffer through a tribulation period marked by laughably bad dialogue.  We don't actually see anybody vanishing, various characters just tell us that it happened.  I assume this decision was made because the VFX weren't good enough.From there, the movie continues to grow more ridiculous.  The screenplay is amazingly bad, and none of the characters behave in a way that is remotely realistic.  Cameron and the supporting cast give it their best shot, but there's no way to draw any life from this worthless script.  The visuals appear silly and slipshod throughout the movie, and the cinematography is very boring.One final note many on this board claim that the movie tries to convert nonbelievers to Christianity.  Actually, all the filmmakers seem more interested in gloating about the percieved suffering of non-Christians.  As a believer, I found this attitude very offensive.

But yeah, as a Christian, I can say that this is a bad movie, if you see it without reading the books.The series created by LaHaye and Jenkins is great. It's gripping, and although there are now thirteen novels and three prequels, you just can't get enough. Mainly, the most symbolic novel is the first, in which the series takes its name. So, it was almost obvious someone was going to make a film adaptation. The problem Christians decided to make it like all the other ones they've made. That means low budget, amateur writing and acting and generic directing.So, if you have already read the novel, you might not see it too bad, as you have a good expectation, but it's still bad. I mean, it doesn't even live up to the novel in which it's based.For instance, the casting had little to no effort. Rayford was supposed to be blonde and with slightly gray hair, Chloe was supposed to be younger and Bruce Barnes was supposed to be white (no racist commentary intended, seriously).Then there's the dialog. Apparently, Christian film-making has been doomed to sound like a bad after school TV special all the time. So yeah, you should include the evangelical message, but at least you could have it hidden a little, so you don't scare half of the audience away.Another trademark for Christian movies is a pop rock soundtrack. The score was almost inexistent. (actually, I liked Chance Thomas' score for the video game much better) And, sorry to say this, but I'm sick of the almost obligatory pop song playing on an emotional scene, like Buck's conversion. It's just too cheesy.Unfortunately, the novel had so ambitious ideas, that it couldn't be made into a movie by Christian producers without taking risks or setting a higher budget.There were good aspects, don't worry. Cameron's acting was good, but the best one was the guy playing Carpathia. The best scene was the one in the united nations conference room (even better than in the novel, I have to confess), although it can leave you a little bit disturbed. However, the settings sucked. It doesn't even look like a conference room were world leaders get together.All in all, the movie only works when you read the base material. And trust me, the books are far more better. Actually, almost nothing based on the series is better than it.

Since then, I bought every book upon its new release and gobbled it up, all the way through to The Glorious Appearing.But this movie, well, it and the others only seemed to borrow from the books rather than make a movie based on them. Yeah, in one respect its good, and as a Christian myself I can see where its an inspirational movie with a message I very much believe in. But I will say that this movie had the potential to be so much more than it was, and as such it disappointed me in that respect. The producers decided to release it to video, then 3 months later release it to theaters. Why? Why not release it to theaters first and then get it out to video? This is probably why the movie did so badly.Good points - The acting is top-notch. Brad Johnson as the troubled and haunted Rayford Steele, distraught over the loss of his wife and son in the Rapture. Janaya Stephens really plays well as the rebellious daughter Steele didn't lose, Chloe. And you really feel for Clarence Gilyard's character, who preached the Word of God but chose not believe in it. Lastly, we have Kirk Cameron, who portrays his role of Cameron Buck Williams to the letter. The scene of his conversion to Christ is almost tear-jerking. And the assassination scene, I must say was very well done. Bad points - The movie moves too fast at times, and at others too slowly. Borrowing from the the book rather than basing itself on it, and having cheesy effects which look like a TV movie instead of a big-budget thriller. Added in scenes for convenience it seems rather than continuity will leave you asking yourself What happened?

It is absolutely one of the worst movies I've ever seen. Combine that with the my positive view on the books, and the experience was doubly disappointing.There are drunk college students in film schools across America that are churning out better product than this is.  The film editing is high-school level.  The special effects are lame by today's action standards. The cinematography is uninventive and downright lazy work.That's not the worst of it though.  The worst part of the film has to be the writing.  Someone should take the screenwriters who adapted the film out to be shot!  Half the dialogue of the book was left out! This should've been made into a 3-hour epic on the level of Braveheart, and what you got was an hour & a half piece of garbage that wouldn't pass a 1st year film school class!Another person who should be beaten, shot , and hung is the Casting Director.  Ok, so you've got the most successful Christian literature series in the history of time on your hands.  Finally there's a basis for making an film on Christianity that can be broadcast to the masses, and who do you pick as your leading man? The leading man whose character is a tough, maverick journalist that comes off as a blonde Indiana Jones with a notebook? KIRK CAMERON! KIRK CAMERON couldn't convince me he's a rebel with a dislike for authority if he held Police Officers hostage for a day!  The guy's never been a good actor and he gets worse in this one.  His cast doesn't help him much.  They tossed in Kirk's wife and a bunch of no-names. Hattie Durham was supposed to be hotter than hot.  Chelsea Noble is barely cute by movie standards.  Chloe steel is supposed to be a very attractive college girl.  The actress who plays her wouldn't raise any eyebrows on campus.  What the hell kind of box-office appeal is that supposed to have? You've got a vehicle to spread an amazing story world-wide in the world's most popular media form (movies) and you pick a no-name cast to do it? Amazing! The only saving grace to the cast is Guy Currie as Nicolae. Not a bad job.  At least he looks the part.  As to why they wouldn't go out and get a real big name bad guy for the film I have no idea.Last but not least, I can't leave without tossing some blame back to the Authors, Tim LaHaye and Jerry Jenkins.  After all, they are the ones responsible for selling the movie rights to the right people. Big F in that department.  After reading each book in the series, there was no doubt in my mind that all could be made into big-budget films that would no doubt rack up millions of revenues world-wide for whichever Hollywood studio bought up the rights.  With a mix of action, science-fiction, romance, and religion, it would have wide-based appeal.  Toss in the fact that the religious nature of the film would no doubt stir plenty of controversy. What has been done with this series is a travesty.  Some Christian small-time movie studio put this out and has the film know-how of pure amateurs. It's a mystery as to why LaHaye and Jenkins didn't sell the rights to Dreamworks, Paramount, Miramax, or at least WB! Way to drop the ball boys!

The different events--the rapture, building of the temple, etc.--are explained and the biblical prophecies referring to it are pointed out. The confusion of those who are left behind from the rapture is shown in the movie.The movie does an excellent job showing how the technology we have now and events taking place make the biblical prophecies more of a reality of our time than in previous generations.This sparks interest in those unfamiliar with the prophecies who want to know more.

The movie, more available to general audiences, will spark interest in a lot of people.This movie will open doors for many to what the Bible has to say about the end times.

Yet, for fans this video will please.Acting by  main characters Kirk Cameron (Buck Williams)  and Rayford Steele( Brad Johnson) is adequate. Special effects at times are amateurish . Yet, because of the budget and interest in this long awaited effort it is being awarded the highest score possible.For those that are not interested in movies with a heavy Christian emphasis remember that this is a video aimed  at  a religious audience .

Luckily, movies can make up for things that books can't, but I have to say, I thought it should have been a bit longer. If you compare it to the Lord of the Rings Book and Movie Trilogy, at least there's was an effort by Peter Jackson to make the movies really similar to the book.

I'm not really sure where to begin with this, but I suppose I will begin with when it happened to me. It was the day I opened my heart to God, and asked him for forgiveness. For what you ask? Well for denying him for one. For the very evil that kept him from helping me with my life. It was in that moment that I felt the most incredible joy I had ever felt in my life. It was as if God's spirit stood within me. There wasn't a word that could describe it. Trust me...I looked around, because I wanted to tell others what I was feeling. It gives you happiness. Its something you cant really understand without God's help. Shortly after my experience with God, I found a passage in the Bible that helped me out with that.And the light shineth in darkness; and the darkness comprehended it not. John 15 You see like so many other people who deny God, I was that darkness looking at the light. In no way could I understand what he offered. So many people in the movie eventually find this as well.One of my biggest problems is not being able to see God. You know what? I couldn't see the wind either, or the love I felt...but yet I believed in them. So I countered with the witness of wind, as it blows things. Well the same was with God, he has created everything around us, its a witness to all the glory that he is.I know this movie might be fiction, but it holds so many truths. I would deem it a must see for anyone. The rapture is coming...its so close. If your reading this, why not give God a chance? I mean what could you really lose? Its a win win situation... I promise he can and will make a change in your life.

I used to believe this, but when I actually read my bible, I was surprised to find that nowhere is there a pretrib rapture, a seven year tribulation (the bible doesn't say how long it is).The pretrib view came about to make Christians feel safe. This is a very dangerous view in my opinion. I know many people that say, Oh, I'll become a Christian after people disappear. Then I'll know the bible is real. The bible says there are no second chances. 1 Thess. 52-3 For yourselves know perfectly that the day of the Lord so cometh as a thief in the night. For when they shall say, Peace and safety; then sudden destruction cometh upon them, as travail upon a woman with child; AND THEY SHALL NOT ESCAPE The bible is clear that the rapture (a word that isn't even in the bible) and His second coming are one and the same. Also read Matt 2429-31. To sum it up, the passage says that AFTER the tribulation, THEN the Son of Man appears in the clouds to GATHER his elect. Also read Matt 2422.Notice also how the pretrib view is different than the biblical view. They're complete opposites. Much like creation and evolutionism are complete opposites. The bible says that man brought death into the world, evolution says death brought man. One of these is biblical, the other is created by Satan to deceive the world. Satan works by deception. He likes to make things sound good so we'll more readily accept the lies. Yes, Satan is deceiving many christians today regarding end times events. The bible even tells us that many of the elect (christians) will be deceived.I realize that this will rub many Christians the wrong way. But you know what? Sometimes the truth hurts. If you're in a dark room you can't see a thing. You fumble around and guess as to what's there. Suddenly someone turns on the light, and it hurts at first.

No other way to put it. * (out of four)","Date":"21 February 2001","Score":"10 out of 26 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Drama, Fantasy","Review":"  LEFT BEHIND THE MOVIE / (2000) * (out of four)By Blake French	Left Behind The Movie is based on the novel by Tim LaHaye and Jerry B. Jenkins, which I have never read, but after watching this movie I can confidently say I never intend to. It is like the filmmakers wanted to make a film about the end of the world but had no story so they decided to rip off as much material as possible from other movies. They should have ripped off even more because the best parts of Left Behind The Movie are recycled straight from other productions; any original ideas the film has on its own are agonizingly routine and wreak of desperation. This movie is truly horrible. Kirk Cameron stars as a young and ambitious TV reporter named Buck Williams. He just so happens to be interviewing a scientist in Jerusalem when a military attack on Israel interrupts them. Buck must be the luckiest person alive to be at such the right place at such the right time. When day turns into night and the air force begin to explode in mid air without being fired upon, we know something must be up.  	Cut to Chicago where a pilot, Rayford (Brad Johnson), is cheating on his wife (Christine MacFadyen), a religious fanatic. Their marriage is, of course, on the rocks their two offspring (Jack Manchester and Janaya Stephens) deal with their own problems. Despite his wife's objections, Rayford is called to duty on a flight. On that flight, various passengers suddenly disappear leaving only their clothing behind. It is unintentionally funny how the passengers' clothes are left behind, in an upright sitting position clearly safety pinned to the chairs.	There is the setup, but I will go no further in explaining the story. The remainder of the film consists of countless scenes where masses of confused people shout and bicker with each other while the filmmakers recycle every cliché in the book. Paranoid informants, government conspiracies, unscrupulous preachers, exploding automobiles, shooting snipers, but none of these things are developed. The reporter's reluctant attitude and robust intentions are stereotypical; Rayford's marital conflicts are never really clear, only discussed to give the characters a little background; Buck's paranoid friend is so eccentric and overacted it is funny. The characters are horribly written and equally acted; I never cared about a single one of them.So what is the conflict here? Discovering the cause of the disappearances? If you are unaware of the cause of the vanishing then  you are not of the movies target audience. The film is not a mystery, but attempts to show what the end times will be like according to the scriptures. But the movie takes the wrong path in doing so. The characters wander through the shameless story with nothing to do; it is just plain boring and annoying.	The film's director is Victor Sarin, who is an accomplished cinematographer and director of many TV programs and series. That is not a surprise because Left Behind The Movie looks like a cheap, made for TV movie? It is never a good sign when a movie is first released on video, then later in theaters to increase the potential audience. Isn't it supposed to be the other way around? Makes about as much sense as anything in the movie. Maybe after the surprise success of The Omega Code the filmmakers thought they could continue the prosperity stride of Christian-based movies. No such luck; by the time you read this review, the film will probably be out of theaters and back to the video shelves.   "}]
