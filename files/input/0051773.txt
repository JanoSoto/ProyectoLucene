[{"Title":"Reely Something","Date":"8 February 2006","Score":"46 out of 51 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Romance","Review":" Indiscreet is one of the great examples of the multiple advantages of film over the live performance. The film was taken from a play on Broadway entitled Kind Sir that had almost a year's run and starred Charles Boyer and Mary Martin. The entire play is set in the apartment of the leading lady.Stanley Donen didn't settle for that. He used the entire city of London as a set and the day and night life of London is glitteringly photographed in technicolor. This film has only seven speaking parts, but all the glitz hides that beautifully.We're talking here about romance among the very upper crust. Ingrid Bergman is a world famous actress getting on in years, but still looking sharp and looking for love. Cary Grant is a sophisticated diplomat who avoids marriage by making up a fictitious wife that he says will not divorce him. Now those roles are hardly an acting stretch for those two leading players, but I defy anyone to come up with better casting.Indiscreet has a nice title song that is only heard instrumentally, but Frank Sinatra fans will find the James Van Heusen-Sammy Cahn song on one of his albums. Too bad it wasn't sung in the film.Cary Grant has always been one leading man who has never been afraid of doing some very physical comedy in his films. Arsenic and Old Lace and The Bachelor and The Bobby Soxer come immediately to mind, but Indiscreet has one of my favorite Cary Grant moments. During a black tie and tuxedo affair, a foursome reel is called. Grant doesn't have the foggiest idea how to do the foursome reel, but he does one grand job at trying to fake it and the other dancers enjoy his impromptu efforts as did this member of the audience.No deep messages in Indiscreet, just good old entertainment brought to us a by a leading man and lady still with fans the world over.

It's about a successful actress in London who's through with men and suddenly becomes very interested in them again when she's introduced to Cary Grant. He could sure shake me out the doldrums, too. The trouble with Grant is that he's a married man...he says.Bergman is charming and quite funny. I especially love the phone call when Grant calls up from the lobby - all for the benefit of the apartment staff - and she makes faces, rolls her eyes and indicates that this charade of oh, well, just come up for one drink then is only for the sake of her reputation - meanwhile, she's found out about a charade of his own and is ripping mad at him. She plots to get even with him - and what a plot! I love the way this film was done - these two are having an affair but it's only assumed, never actually shown. Grant is his usual stunningly handsome, elegant self, and few actors had his turn of a phrase or panache. He and Bergman, as in Notorious, make a beautiful, magnetic couple. This is not a laugh-out-loud comedy, but it is a delight. This film was remade for TV with the gorgeous Lesley-Anne Down and Robert Wagner, but it wasn't the same without the stars and Stanley Donen's touch.

Bergman and Grant's characters live in a world of wealth - fine clothing and food, casual international travel, servants but always come across as real people in a real romance - funny, tempermental, charming, silly, scheming, brilliant, irrational and clever.

She is introduced by her sister Margaret (Phyllis Calvert) and brother-in-law Alfred (Cecil Parker) introduce her to a wealthy American Philip Adams. Alfred works for NATO, and he is trying to get Philip to accept a job with it. There is a dinner that Philip is giving a speech at, and he needs someone to accompany him. Anna goes, and they hit it off. But when they are alone he explains to her that he is a married man. Anna at first retreats from further interest in him, but she changes her mind. And soon they are having a full scale love affair, although she is aware that there is a Mrs. Adams back in the United States who won't give him a divorce.Eventually (due to an police report that Alfred has access to) it comes out that Philip is lying. He is not married he only says so so that he can have what he claims is an honest love affair where both parties know ahead of time that there is no chance for permanence. The problem of betraying a spouse (with whom there is supposedly no current love) is gotten rid of from the first. So the remainder is pure romance.Alfred disagrees with Philip and says that most people want to be married (a rather conventional thought, but Parker's Alfred is a very conventional sort). Later it all becomes a moot point. Margaret saw the same report, and tells Anna. When Anna learns that the man she has come to adore is single (while she thought he was hopelessly tangled in a marriage he could not get out of), she erupts, and yells the line that is in the Summary line above.Rather than simply break with the lying Philip, Anna decides to teach him a lesson - she is going to make him think her fickle with a long discarded lover. The rest of the film follows the revenge that she plans, and what happens as a result.Flimsy as the story line sounds, the casts carries it off. The film is set in an upper Anglo-American setting, of luxury west end flats, private clubs, diplomat dinners and dances, and private yachts. But Grant and Bergman are giving the oxygen to the lead roles (their second film together since Hitchcock's NOTORIOUS a decade before). Parker and Calvert are suitably good as the conservative brother-in-law and sister, with Parker making the statement that he was born old (a comment that his movie watching admirers would certainly feel is correct). Also note Meg Jenkins and David Kossoff as Anna's servants Doris and Carl. Kossoff in particular shows a healthy fear of unexpected reactions that Anna's practical joking never made room for, and adds a little bit to the conclusion of the movie.

Cary Grant, James Stewart, Paul Newman, Sean Connery, Gregory Peck and many other male movie stars ( not Clark Gable though) seem to develop more charm and sex appeal along with the wrinkles and grey hair.  This preamble is by way of saying that Cary Grant is convincingly cast in 'Indiscreet' as a middle aged Romeo (he was 54) whereas the beautiful Ingrid Bergman is a tad too old at 43 to be playing the role of a beautiful theatrical star with whom Cary Grant falls instantly in love and gives up his bachelor life for.  I could not help but compare 'Indiscreet ' with their last pairing together in 'Notorious' in 1946 twelve years earlier.  Cary Grant is as suave, debonair and handsome as ever in 'Indiscreet '.  Ingrid Bergman's beauty though, has by no means waned but rather matured into middle age -  as well as becoming a size bigger.  Or perhaps it is just that every movie star looks better in black and white.No matter, it is still an endearing film with elegant sets and costumes. If only the comedy element had been played up more and the dewy romance element played down - in the style of the 1930s films such as 'My Favourite Wife' and 'The Awful Truth'.  Cary Grant is at his supreme best in this type of comedy. The best part in 'Indiscreet' for me was the comedy scene when Cary Grant danced in a highland reel - it was hilarious.  I am sure that with more emphasis on the comedy side and with better lines, Ingrid Bergman could have been a match for Irene Dunne or Rosalind Russell.Don't let my comments put you off.  Any film starring these two incomparable and much loved stars is worth a watch.

This is another well-centered film about people worth knowing. One is a famous actress, played charmingly by Ingrid Bergman; the other is a economics expert, unusually well-played by suave Cary Grant. The entire plot of the film made from a fine Norman Krasna play also sums up its theme in this world you get what you deserve by being yourself. Grant saunters into Bergman's life; she falls in love with him. He tells her he's maritally unavailable, she ignores what he says, then finds out he is unmarried and completely available--and blames him for having deceived her. So she stages a large charade to make him jealous, and he comes too soon, spoils the trick and asks her to marry him. I first saw the movie nearly 50 years ago at Radio City Music Hall; it is still an holiday favorite of mine. The play from which the delightful and only slightly-static screenplay was derived was Kind Sir. Krasna adapted his own play winningly. Music was provided by Richard Rodney Bennett and Ken Jones; art direction was by Don Ashton, cinematography by Frederick Young. In addition to the principals, the fine cast included Cecil Parker, Phyllis Calvert, Megs Jenkins and David Kossoff. The unusual quality of the piece lies in its never looking like a play; instead the skilled performers bring the characters to life before one's eyes. I find the film leisurely in an adult, relaxed sort of way which invites the viewer into the character's minds so that one learns of progress, disappointment or unexpected agreement along with them. The superior dialogue sparkles; and the sense of important lives being lived with some intelligence is a welcome change from the content of most films, then and especially since 1958. Moviegoers need to thank Stanley Donen for yet another cinematic delight.

Sorry, don't even mention those other actresses in the same breath as Bergman! She is in a class of her own - and shows it in this film. She was 42 when she filmed it - and it really doesn't make any difference. She's not pretending to be a young girl with her first lover. As for any comparison with Notorious - no!

It is based on the play Kind Sir written by Norman Krasna. Plot sees Bergman as Anna Kalman, an accomplished actress who can't believe her luck when she finally meets the man of her dreams, Philip Adams (Grant). However, Phillip is keeping a secret, a secret that Anna finds out about and promptly sets about getting even with him for.Indiscreet is a very simple movie. Grant and Bergman re-team again 12 years after making Notorious with Alfred Hitchcock. Their chemistry is again sparkling and Donen utilises it to the maximum by naturally building the film around the charismatic stars. There's no hidden agendas here, the movie knows it is breezy and understands that good writing (edgy at times) and two comfortable actors can make for good entertainment. It starts off slow, but the character build up pays off once Grant & Bergman start their romance, in fact the comedy is indeed thin on the ground for the first half of the film. But once the secret at the core of the plot is out, the comedy kicks into gear, with a dancing party sequence joyous and alone is worth watching the film for.Also note worthy is the London location which provides a fitting back drop to the well mannered, well to do, coupling of Anna & Phillip. While the costumes too are pleasing and hang nicely off of the two aesthetically safe-in middle-age actors. It's no screwball, far from it, so any expectation of that will surely disappoint newcomers. And true to say it's very old fashioned and of its time as regards its romantic ideals. But that's OK, we like light hearted well written comedy, especially when it's performed as smooth as it is here. 7/10 "},{"Title":"A splendid movie","Date":"21 May 2009","Score":"2 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Romance","Review":" Ingrid Bergman and Cary Grant are marvelous together in this movie.

That strange fascination you have for each other, the long, almost quizzical stares, comfortable moments of silence - it's all there, given ample time to breathe and play out naturally by director Stanley Donen's unhurried camera.The ending feels a little rushed though, especially in the final moments, and the film as a whole feels considerably longer than its runtime but those flaws are far from fatal. What's a little more disappointing is the lack of any really remarkable humour. It nails the romance, but seems undecided as to whether it wants to be a comedy or not. Before the jarring switch to semi-farce in the final act most of the humour comes from supporting actors and consequently feels like something of an afterthought.Overall this is a class act. A sophisticated, quiet romantic comedy that sees everyone involved at the top of their game. And while it's not a perfect confection it's sweet enough to satisfy even the most helpless of romantics.

Following what was then a scandalous affair with Roberto Rossellini, it took the star power of Cary Grant to re-introduce her to studios and fans. Moreover, he intentionally fought for her as his co-star when she was effectively black listed. We should be grateful he won.The genre of drawing room comedy has sadly passed but we are fortunate to have this example as to why it succeeded for centuries. If not the funniest film ever made it is consistently amusing and witty. This is a play that is assisted by the stars but has stature on it's own in the dialogue. Unlike American Sitcoms there are no set ups for a joke or a guffaw but it flows down a consistently diverting path with no pauses for commercials or to try and explain itself. The plot about a famous actress who meets a charming diplomat and falls in love isn't much you need worry about. From the opening credits it's clear what the ending will be, it's how they get to the end that holds our attention. Bergman and Grant are both superlative actors who in the process of seeming not to really act turn in wonderful performances. What they say has the feel of reality when the actuality is that it's been thoughtfully constructed. The often quoted line, How dare he make love to me and not be a married man, sums up every one's attitude to a rather casual acceptance of a situation as it is. There's no simpering about matters sexual, but, happily, we're spared the deed done. (If you watch closely there's an artfully directed exchange between the two characters in bed whilst separated by the English Channel. It worked then and, some years later, for Doris Day and Rock Hudson in a split screen with them both in bathtubs.) Director Stanley Donen uses London as a character and does not try and improve on it by having studio constructed interiors when the real things are at hand. And who knew Cary Grant could do an energetic Highland Fling? At base, only six people appear-there are a very few very minor characters-who take full advantage of a droll script and play it as if they were telling the audience, in flash back, of an event that has just finished. It's a wonderful, delicious story and you're glad to hear it particularly as it's so well told. Attractive people doing attractive things in attractive places is a good basis. That they can talk about what they're doing in diverting ways makes INDISCREET a necessary lesson in love, charm and confusion.

Watching this one made me recall that friend's plea, and understand it too. 1958 was the date in this case, and when you get to see the hypocritical social conventions those people lived --and dyed-- for, one trembles at the idea of conducting such type of living conditions...The woman over twenty five, our leading lady (Bergman was 42 when she made this movie, but she represented 30, jaw-dropping beautiful) was constantly looking --and starting to get desperate-- for a... HUSBAND, because apparently to be single was one of the original Capital Sins at the time.IF she found a candidate, it was verboten for her to be the one making overt declarations of love, even of amorous interest!In this case she had a younger sister (Phyllis Calvert, born the same year Ingrid Bergman was born, and looking quite stunning herself) a sister that was more level headed but brainwashed also with all the prejudices of those days, that tried all the time to find a candidate for her unlucky sister (unlucky because she was getting on in years and wasn't married yet), creating some mildly funny dialogs.Cary Grant's character suffered a similar persecution (it WAS a veritable, obsessive persecution at the time) from people asking him WHY wasn't he MARRIED and with children at HIS AGE... (he looked older than Bergman but was exceedingly handsome and incredibly elegant).A fascinating detail of upper-crust luxury living we'll never experience was in that night scene where from the moment they leave the theater and start walking fully in love with each other and her chauffeured personal Rolls Royce --black and white-- silently and slowly keeps pace with them at their disposition whenever they could decide to stop walking...Wow!! (They arrived at her place walking all the way from the theater (she was a famous actress), totally oblivious of the Rolls, that stops silently in front of her building, its chauffeur waiting for new orders). ***SPOILERS AHEAD*** Since we discovered that Grant's character had the nerve to coldly lay out his theory of enjoying women without the responsibility of marriage and children suffocating his bachelor freedom, invents a wife impossible to divorce as a pretext to always escape any uncomfortable situations (why he cannot get a divorce, is never explained in the script) poor Bergman would be socially ostracized because they... HAD SEX!!! (not on the screen please, one only gathered that by seeing a softly closing door (bedroom door) with both of them behind it) and that scene dimming down to black, probably to allow you to recover your breath after watching such salacious and daring situation.And since the male star protagonist of this kind of movies couldn't possibly end the film as a total villain (enjoying women without..., etc, etc.), everything is finally explained and they get happily married!! Isn't that nice? Wow! and I watched the whole concoction to the bitter end!!! (I was forced to, since a friend asked me very politely to watch this movie that previously he enjoyed immensely).Yes, it was superbly played by everybody involved in the film, the sets were gorgeous, the women dresses were out of this world, everybody's manners SUPERB (from that point of view one aches to return to those gone with the wind days) but otherwise, compared with practically ANY contemporary movie... it's just another Doris Day movie, but with Ingrid Bergman replacing her.One thing that stroke me from the very opening scene was the close up of those magnificent roses... being ARTIFICIAL FLOWERS!!! Same in another scene where he sends her a bouquet of flowers and they are again ARTIFICIAL!!!Why? they worked with a superb budget, certainly could afford two dozen of beautiful REAL roses. I could only understand such a situation in the Latin American movies of the time, where we were accustomed to these type of faux pas as part of very-very low budget movie making, but unpardonable in a De Luxe Hollywood product.Like in a Puerto Rican film with the Argentinian Libertad Leblanc as protagonist where she wears a sleeveless polyester d√©shabill√© with the price ticket dangling from the gown's armhole!! (did they snatched it at a basement sale?!), leans over to smell the bouquet of flowers sent her by an admirer... and the flowers are...PLASTIC!! (it was a serious crime-drama film) we felt down from our seats screaming with laugher in utter delight!! Basta! watch this movie for the beautiful people involved, the beautiful sets and even the beautiful fake flowers, but forget about real life situations because you won't find that here.

Six fine actors, headed by two of movies' best -- Cary Grant and Ingrid Bergman -- and directed by one of our finest directors, Stanley Donen. Grant's entrance (The door was open) immediately announces he is Prince Charming. How could Bergman's Anna Kalman not be smitten? It's clear they're both smitten, but she must take the initiative. Their mutual attraction is handled subtly. The next most romantic scene, beautifully understated, is in the elevator as they return to her flat after the ballet. In it they don't exchange a word.Bergman looks stunning in a marvelous wardrobe of designer dresses, suits and furs, especially a gold evening gown she wears to a dinner dance. Before leaving for that dance she utters the best line in the film How dare he make love to me and not be a married man! Donen ends the film with a brilliant scene, brilliantly played -- almost an operatic duet -- which ends with Phillip tells Anna, You'll like being married, really you will as they are seated on a couch in exactly the same position as Nicky Ferrante and Terry McKay in Leo McCarey's An Affair to Remember. A nice homage by Donen.

Within minutes she is joined by both her housekeeper and chauffeur (Megs Jenkins, David Kossman) and sister (Phyllis Calvert) and brother-in-law (Cecil Parker) who have arrived - thinking Bergman still away - merely to change into evening clothes before attending a diplomatic dinner. Thus well within five minutes screen time we have established a luxury apartment inhabited by a highly successful actress moving in the highest circles. Clearly the original play ('Kind Sir') adapted by the author, Norman Krasna, was confined to this one set and it does, despite 'opening out' retain the feel of a sophisticated play rather than a film. There is, however, a highly 'filmic' moment well within the first reel (and it may well have been retained from the play) when Bergman, head covered in shampoo, Calvert and Parker, turn to find Cary Grant standing in the open doorway personifying charm, glamor and sex appeal with the clear nod to a similar scene in 'Swingtime' when Fred has just sung the ultimate romantic ballad, 'The Way You Look Tonight' to a Ginger similarly lathered in shampoo, reinforcing the magical cinematic quality. Though shooting in color Stanley Donen elects to downplay the lavish sets and let the performances do the glittering. Wise move. Yes, it's frothy, yes, it's insubstantial but YES, YES, YES, it is pure ENTERTAINMENT. Strongly recommended.

It was filmed in inner and outer London and the Elstree Studios.The film is based on a play is not anything more than that, a set argument, simple, smooth, shining where good taste and good manners, where the characters come and go quietly to play a romantic work without pretensions. Cary Grant maximum power elegant stands out even sat down to eat at a kitchen table with oilcloth. Their great potential for comic scenes are shown in the ballroom and the end of the film. Ingrid Bergman comes to the effectiveness of their worth as a great actress who is and others met with no mishaps. The pace and the argument is perhaps too simple but the couple becomes the film in a nice ribbon and high class.The action takes place in London in 1957, over several months. It tells the love story of Anna Kalman (Ingrid Bergman) and Philip Adam (Cary Grant). She is a famous actress, about 33 years, elegant and sophisticated, has had several disappointments love and feel disappointed. He, American diplomat, born in San Francisco 35 years ago, aimed at NATO headquarters in Paris, is an expert in international finance and, as he admits, has had a failed marriage experience. He is fond of music and ballet and commitment averse. The meeting between Anna revives lost illusions.The film develops a romantic comedy between two loving people with past experiences and ages over 30 years, who fall in love like schoolboys, which brings elements of humor and reflection on relationships between age ls and true love. The film unfolds in an atmosphere of luxury and opulence that seen with the eyes of today is cloying. It's notably the Christian Dior wardrobe for Anna, who sought to combine the elegance and innovation on the current fashion. The story contains elements of transgression, which raise the tone of the story and arouse public interest. Philip extramarital love is explained subtleties and detours to avoid censorship. This did not allow the inclusion of a bed scene of the lovers, the director replaced by a double image in which they are separated by a thin vertical suture line. The origins of the filmmaker as a dancer explain the references to the ballet, the gay dance scene of the wheel and vibrant solo dance steps of Cary Grant. The tangle of truths and lies inflames the interest of the story.The music provides an original song, Indiscreet Cahn and Hensen. The score offers a wide selection of solo piano, violin and saxophone and string compositions of romantic and classical airs. The photograph, taken care of and well contrasted, is recreated in large interior spaces, Anna's wardrobe and ornate decor and sumptuous. The mats of different colors of the paintings of Anna salon create curious and new colors. We appreciate the consistent vision of a Picasso aquatint. The script is written with skill and contains some splendid dialogues. The interpretation of the characters, reunited after 12 years from Notorious (1946), is excellent. The direction creates a very interesting comedy of love, intrigue, jealousy, tangles, lies, deceit and revenge.

I watch it every time TCM airs it, usually twice.I think one of my favorite parts of this movie is the age appropriate casting of Bergman. As much as I love Grant and his movies, I get weary seeing him paired with much younger women. (As in North By Northwest, To Catch A Thief, Every Girl Should Be Married and An Affair To Remember.) The script may be a touch weak, but Grant and Bergman are magic together. They were very close friends in real life (Grant was one of the few who stuck by her when she was run out of Hollywood after having an out of wedlock child...while married to another man) and it shows in this movie. Besides the chemistry and spark between them, one can sense a trust between the actors.One reviewer has mentioned that the Phillip/Anna romance seemed sexless. I don't think we watched the same movie because I think there was sex (implied, of course) all over the place! It couldn't be shown (this was filmed in 1958), but if you read between the lines, it is there The coded phone calls when Phillip comes up for a nightcap and the scene in Anna's bedroom when she tells him she has a headache are just two examples. In the latter scene, he's taken off his shoes and gotten on the bed with her (she's in her nightclothes) and starts to kiss her. I think it's pretty obvious that it's not the first time they've been in that situation.The one disappointment for me is the whole lie Anna cooks up once she learns that Phillip isn't married. I realize it's for comedic value, but it just rings false to me. Other than that, I love every second of this film.

But no actor can do it all themeselves--he needs at least something to work with.  There are some scenes here which are undeniably charming, I'd hazard that Cary Grant could make a teeth whitening infomercial seem riveting.I like the sets, I like the supporting cast, I like the general idea of the plot.  I'm not a huge Ingrid Bergman fan, but she's enjoyable to watch.  And the last thirty minutes or so are quite nice to watch.  THe problems come in the first hour or so--long swaths of nothing.  I think what they were going for were long meaningful looks, rising tensions and all of that.  But, no, doesn't work.  The music is intrusive, the scenes of London aren't really that well filmed, (it's hard to accomplish that, in that london such is a beautiful city). And, as it has become clear, I enjoy justing watching Cary Grant walk through a door and putting down his briefcase.  And there's a flash, others have mentioned, of his old physical comedy prowess during the Scottish dancing.  And to be honest, that's probably the worth owning the tape all by itself.  Kind of like the scene from Gilda with Rita Hayworth singing Put the Blame on Mame.  I think everyone should see these sorts of movies, chick flicks though they may be.  THey give a nice counter mood to the testosterone filled movies you'd see with Peckinpah or Milius. It's not on the level of My Favorite Wife, The Awful Truth, or Holiday, and well, Bringing Up Baby should be in the top ten list of greatest movies ever, so it's not fair to compare it to that.  And Ingrid Bergman can't quite compete with Rosalind Russell, Katherine Hepburn, or Irene Dunne.  It's a minor effort during a time when Grant made some good movies, but was coming to the conclusion, it seems, that it was time to retire like he did everything else gracefully.

Directed rather flatly by Stanley Donen as he was making the transition from musicals like Singin' in the Rain and Seven Brothers for Seven Brides, the 1958 film is elegantly mounted but a bit hamstrung by Norman Krasna's uneventful script. The problem is that not much really happens in the story, at least not enough to stretch the expansive talents of the two stars. While Bergman shows what a game farceur she can be with a sharp way of delivering a smart line, Grant seems more on automatic pilot as he applies his naturally debonair manner to a rather idealized character.The focus of the plot is on renowned stage actress Anna Kalman, who has not had much luck with men but certainly gets stalked by overzealous fans every time she is in public. Coming home early from a failed romantic rendezvous, she accidentally meets dashing diplomat Philip Adams. He's handsome, he's successful, he's Cary Grant after all. As an apparent beacon of decency, he admits to Anna that he's married. However, that doesn't stop them from embarking on an illicit affair, which gets stalled only periodically by guilt arising from the adulterous aspect of it. She is resigned to be Philip's back street mistress until she finds out he is not what he quite appears. This is where the film gets a bit more interesting even if it takes over an hour to get to that pivotal point. Simmering anger is followed by a petty act of vengeance as a punishment for the deceit that one character performs on the other, even if the basis of the deceit is well-intentioned.Then in her forties and coming back from exile due to the Rossellini scandal, Bergman exhibits a stylish self-confidence befitting a stage star like Anna. As likable and charismatic as Grant is, he only comes to life as Philip when the deceptions reveal themselves. Cecil Parker and Phyllis Calvert lend able comic support, though I never could buy the premise that Calvert and Bergman could be sisters given their differing accents. For the most part, Donen simply films the story like a play, no surprise since it was based on a moderately successful Broadway play called Kind Sir. If you are a fan of either star, you are likely to have already seen this bauble of a film. Otherwise, the 100-minute running time may stretch your patience. As part of the Cary Grant 4-Disc Collector's Edition, the 2008 DVD unfortunately offers no extras.

Ingrid's return to light comedy (after a side-step for Elena et Des Hommes in France)as her marriage to Rosselini was crumbling has produced Indiscreet. What one treasures is the thought that in Indiscreet, Ingrid may have been playing a character not too different from herself. Also, one sees the Italian influence in her acting as she storms off to her bedroom after learning the truth about Philip Adams. Ingrid never got a nomination for this performance, but it is a joy to watch. The breakfast nook scene after Philip announces that he will take the Paris job (and not go to Mexico) is so believable - we see a woman who has 40+ years showing the inner giggling of a school girl.

Alongside her is Grant's Philip Adams, a NATO analyst (think of him as an off-duty Hitchcock hero) who pretends to be married whilst indulging in steamy, hotel room liaisons with Anna. The film unleashes a barrage of Hitchcockian double entendres - I love hard currency, Bergman purrs &#x96; before Bergman explodes upon learning that the man she's having an affair with dares to make love to me and not be married! With notions regarding what's sexy, charming, flirtateous and romantic always changing somewhat, modern audiences will no doubt find Indiscreet a dull, stiff, archaic affair. What the film gets right is the reliance of pleasure on taboo and transgression. I.e. you want it because you can't have it, and not having it increases the pleasure of attaining it. Take this further &#x96; studies show that those who masturbate more have fewer nocturnal dreams &#x96; and you can extrapolate all manners of creepiness pleasure, hedonism and the death of discretion leading directly to the wider, societal death of dreams, possibility and even romance itself. On a smaller scale, Grant's lack of a wife results in Anna's failures to sustain her illusions and opens up the traumatic possibility that she may actually possess him. And of course nothing kills the illusion of a happily ever after, than an after.Though marketed as a showcase for mega-stars Grant and Bergman, actress Phyllis Calvert steals the show. The film contains an unintentionally creepy scene in which Grant dances a jig. It's cringe inducing. Like watching your grandpa flirt with choir girls.6.9/10 &#x96; Worth one viewing.

I know this was supposed to be a breezy comedy but I think it could have stayed that way even if the beautiful and intelligent Anna had spoken frankly with oh-so-urbane Philip. Abler writing could have pulled this off.After the far-less-satisfying second half, the audience gets the ending it always wanted, but, because the writers didn't pay their dues to get there, the movie leaves a viewer wanting more. Even so, the first half of Indiscreet is pure poetry, aided in part by wonderfully understated performances by Phyllis Calvert and Cecil Parker as Anna's sister and brother-in-law.I saw this film as I myself greatly anticipated a first date with a charming man, and it proved as almost-perfect prelude to that exciting experience.Flawed, but a gem nevertheless!

(To quote the film there must be a catch in it somewhere.) The problem isn't the catch (you've already guessed by now what it may be, and there's nothing wrong with that - this sort of thing is all about execution - and don't be so sure it's the *obvious* catch), but that the chemistry is just slightly off this time. It worked better a couple years earlier on Broadway with Charles Boyer and Mary Martin for a season's run, but chemistry is a tricky thing. In black & white for Hitchcock a few years earlier, in NOTORIOUS, Grant and Bergman had it in spades. In INDISCREET, they just miss, and I don't think it has anything to do with the intervening years and Rossellini. Grant would do this sort of thing to *perfection* a few years later in THE GRASS IS ALWAYS GREENER (Deborah Kerr and Noel Coward background music); Bergman would do it *close* to perfection a few years later ('though Bacall had done it better on stage) in A CACTUS FLOWER with Walter Matthau in the Barry Nelson role; and even Krasna would do it better a few years later in Sunday IN NEW YORK, but the chemistry and tone is just a bit off here (Krasna's dialogue which tries to sparkle lies there in the soap suds (too many tries for AN AFFAIR TO REMEMBER tears where CACTUS FLOWER laughs are called for) despite everything director Stanley (CHARADE) Donen does to make it shine and, for me, the bubbles burst and souffl√© is served flat.As Bergman says of another early in the film, I tried to love him, but I just don't.

He SOUNDS just like Walter Slezak (the back of his head even looks like him!), and you *have* to love anything with Walter Slezak in it (don't miss COME September if you love boulevard comedy!), but we never see his face and he isn't credited.Ah well.

"},{"Title":"Fanning the Flames of Desire in 'Indiscreet'","Date":"3 December 2005","Score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Romance","Review":" Fervent desire often overlaps into soft-porn territory in the cinematic language and images of the aughties, to the extent that the old-fashioned spirit in some of us yearns for timeless romantic movies such as 1958's Indiscreet. These films remind us of the importance of courtship in modern times. This reviewer has nary a word against adult nudity on film, when handled artistically and sans embarrassment as in many European films, but even more offensive than today's shock stock are the inane romantic comedies made by directors/auteurs who believe that casting good-looking actors precludes using a well-written script. While not a perfect film, Indiscreet, starring Cary Grant and Ingrid Bergman, captures the bliss and blush of courtship between two middle-aged adults and the reluctant romance that subtly blossoms between them. Sure, the camera loves Grant and Bergman, but their fine acting combined with clever dialogue outshine their exterior beauty.Courtship, wherefore art thou? Grant as Philip and Bergman as Anna stare longingly into each other'seyes in various scenes in Indiscreet. In the breakfast nook scene in Anna's apartment, Philip lets his meal grow cold while Anna prepares hers at the stove. (It's servants' day off was her seductive phone invite earlier that morning.) One of Bergman's best lines in this scene is Stop. Good manners spoil good food. Once seated, she too finds it nearly impossible to eat because her suitor is drinking in her eyes. More than once they eat, pause to stare at each other, then resume noshing.Also quite memorable are the scenes detailing the first date between the stage actress and the international diplomat. After consuming too much champagne at a private club where Anna's brother-in-law, Alfred, is a member, they arrive too late to attend a ballet performance of Romeo and Juliet and decide to give Anna's tickets to two teen-agers. Here is where Grant delivers one of the most understated lines in Indiscreet I know how the story ends, bad. (That comment, not simply a reference to the Shakespearean drama, could have been meant as a social statement about conservative adults' opposition to young love in '50s America -- i.e. the waltz vs. rock n' roll.) Rather than end the evening with a failed date, Anna and Philip return to the club for more libation and laughter topped off by a nighttime stroll past London monuments, Anna's chauffeur and a few of her fans trailing them.The final scene of Anna and Philip's first night of courtship exemplifies subtly handled erotic fire in Indiscreet. Anna and Philip briefly share banter about a night cap before disappearing into her apartment and shutting the door. When the camera zooms out from the shot of that closed door, the visual effect and erotic impact are more telling than a Do Not Disturb sign hanging on the doorknob outside a honeymoon suite. By stark contrast, many R-rated flicks today are overhanded in the area of sexual content. They prefer lingerie shedding and naughty/scatological word lashing to, say, Bertolucci's early films (think Last Tango in Paris) that treat nudity and sex as moving sculptures and paintings, respectively, and reserve curse words for existential statements.Whenever I need romantic inspiration, I pop Indiscreet into my DVD player and wait for the glances, kisses and innuendos to begin.

Here are mature, successful characters who have the style to handle any situation, inhabiting a convincing world of international society. They know when propriety can be wordlessly side-stepped, which provides some shocking moments that Donen's camera pursues up to a point, then pulls away. Here is a world of quiet-toned dining chambers, highly-sought positions and intelligent conversations. The first half of the movie delightedly makes very few concessions to convention. Grant is even allowed to be seen making a speech on a boring topic. Male adulthood, you see, didn't always revolve around the Wii, superhero movies, and skateboarding&#x85; sigh!Sadly the writer avoided the responsibility due to viewers after adopting the central ruse; which in the long term makes no sense, and by the end the movie becomes completely belabored. Grant portrays himself as a married man because it makes him more desirable to women. In the end he will choose to marry Bergman, and exactly how will he explain an ex-wife who is absent from photos, phone calls, documents or friends reminiscences? Perhaps the writer imagined viewers would be so caught up in the present, they'd forget there's a future. This idea is also pretty off-putting. In the modern world Grant's lie is not cute, but very creepy. The last 40 minutes are not very enjoyable because they tease out a revenge that's nowhere near as enjoyable as the light first hour or so. In a final poor choice, a viewer is cheated of a decent resolution, which is irritatingly squeezed into the last 5 seconds.I very much disliked an obnoxious, lame & late attempt at physical comedy in which the characters dance a reel at a social event; it goes on long enough to become lethal, and it's low physical humor (silly dancing from Grant) belongs to some other character in some other movie. Grant is not some attention-starved boor in the better half of the movie.But this is definitely worth seeing, and even preferable to me than Notorious which I find unbearably silly.

It's a big disappointment, coming as it does from a play by witty Norman Krasna and directed by none other than Stanley Donen. But, in my opinion, it fails to deliver the goods in more ways than one.First, the story is so slight you could sum it up in one sentence--which I won't do here because then I'd be giving the whole plot away! Take it from me, the material is gossamer thin. This was true of other Norman Krasna scripts too, but at least they had more comic style going for them than is on display here.INGRID BERGMAN (still lovely but looking a bit matronly in her early 40s) and CARY GRANT simply don't have the same chemistry they did in NOTORIOUS--which is just as much a fault of the script as it is of the actors. He wants to have an affair with an actress (no strings attached) so he tells her he's married (when he isn't). That's supposed to take care of the plot for the length of the film. Please.No, can't say I have any special fondness for this one, except for one scene at a ball where Grant goes into an impromptu jig--showing, of course, that he still had quite a flair for comedy when it wasn't being repressed.Bergman proved in CACTUS FLOWER that she could do comedy when she wanted to--but she really doesn't have much of a chance here to be anything more than modestly charming as she plays a coy game of flirtation with a man she thinks is a married playboy.PHYLLIS CALVERT and CECIL PARKER made no particular impression on me in supporting roles.

Cary seems to be doing an impersonation of himself, sleepwalking through his clich√© mannerisms and speeches. He never seems sincere and keeps his costar at an emotional distance (but it is fun to see him dance a jig). Ingrid seems phony and arrogant and just off-putting. She's supposed to be ultra-glamorous but just looks tired and plain. They have no romantic chemistry at all and in keeping with the time, share only a few tepid kisses, though much more is implied. The dialogue is unbelievably stilted, so ultra-witty and sophisticated that it never sounds like a real conversation. It's based on a play and filmed in a very artificial, stagy way.I was amazed at how dull the movie was and actually dozed off in the middle. Because it's about a man who pretends to be married to avoid commitment and a woman who wants to carry on with a married man, I didn't like or admire either of them.

The author (and to an extent the director) should have had the courage to cut a lot of the priceless speeches that may have worked on the stage and to have understood that the screen needs an amount of movement, whether of camera, people, change of shot, or all of the above.Unfortunately too, the central conceit of the piece &#x96; that it is quite correct to have an affair with an openly married man but shamefully immoral to spend five minutes alone with a single one &#x96; wears a bit thin, and not for the first time, Cary Grant has to play a charmer who is in fact a rather unpleasant and selfish deceiver.

After noting that it was originally a stage play, I asked myself If this were on the stage, could Grant hold his own and make it a success? The answer is a resounding YES. The guy was a terrific actor. His acting ability makes this succeed as a movie and would have also as a stage play. Of course Bergman is well-respected and honored as a film/stage actress, but this movie proves once again that Grant deserves more respect than he gets.The film is expensively made and oozes class but the wealthy characters seem shallow. It almost seems like a Pillow-Talk style Doris Day comedy that has been lavishly upgraded to wealthy British social circles.

About a decade earlier, her very public affair with Roberto Rossellini temporarily damaged her career.

Oddly, however, despite this being an affair, the film seems to imply that they never get around to actually committing adultery! They spend lots of time together and whisper sweet nothings to each other, but their relationship seems sex-less! I'm sure this would have been handled very differently if it were made today.As for the rest of the film, it tries very hard to be a romance--with excellent music and cinematography to set the mood. The problem is for me, adultery (or near-adultry like in this film) is a MAJOR turnoff! You can't get past the fact that Ingrid and Cary seem like very selfish people. Later, however, in a very, very bizarre plot twist, you find out that there is a lot more to the affair than meets the eye. What exactly this is and how the film then becomes a bit more of a romantic-comedy is just something you'll have to see for yourself.The bottom line is that this is a pretty agreeable time-passer but also NOT one of the stars' better films.
