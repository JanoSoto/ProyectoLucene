[{"Title":"a legendary and fascinating mess","Date":"19 May 2004","Score":"62 out of 76 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Drama, Romance","Review":"  Not too many movies create myths. Anyone who read Harold Robbins', The Carpetbaggers, (some 40 years ago) which in turn spawned Nevada Smith, gets a superbly fictionalized accounting of Howard Hughes. Such fiction prefixes reality. It took a great number of years before I finally saw The Outlaw - an eagerly awaited event.I've attempted to view the AMC-aired movie some three times - but got so antsy that I abandoned it. Few movies of this caliber have been so uneven. And yet it endures. Vintage alone gives the film status.There's nothing wrong with anecdotal (vignette) - points-of-view movies, but in The Outlaw, it was like watching one of those lumbering, exasperating silent films where the actors stand across from each other, and each speaks their lines as if orchestrated by an off-stage conductor. Spontaneity is not this movie's long suit.The actors Jack Beutel is one of the most beautiful men to ever stand before a camera. His eyes are smoldering, his gaze laconic, his smile cheeky one moment and sensuous the next. Walter Huston is a young man in a middle-aged body; Thomas Mitchell (Scarlet's daddy in 'Gone With the Wind') is shifty, Irish, as conniving as Wally Beery, sniveling and crafty. And then there's the statuesque Jane Russell. Robbins gave us the intimate details of the suspension bridge-designed brassier - and Jane herself speaks of how she finally pulled the damn thing off and lined her breasts with a few Kleenex. She is as luscious as a near-nude Barbie doll, she is 19 years old, her lips inspire poetry - yet her voice is as monotonous as the Valley-inspired Val-speak of 25 years ago.I wouldn't hazard to guess Howard Hughes' emotional consistency in the movie, however something went hellishly wrong. Someone fell on his face when it came to editing and scoring. Take the music, for example. It's Scoring 101, embarrassingly manipulative, often overriding the dialogue and ranging from 'Pathetique' to 'The Lone Prairie' m√©lange.And then there's the acting the Mexican senora rolls her eyes with all the panache of a 1940-Mexican B-movie bit actress. There is no spontaneity; she delivers her lines badly and with burning self-consciousness. And when Huston shoots Beutel in the hand, the latter doesn't even flinch; ditto, when he pierces both his ears with bullets. Staggering disbelief.As to the scene where Jane Russell falls for Jack Beutel and kisses him, it's like watching two trains headed straight for each other. Overblown, top-heavy, agonizingly overreaching...it nonetheless has the sexual potency of an orgasm. The music, the god-awful Close-CLOse-CLOSE UP of Jane's lips bearing down on the half-delirious Beutel. Wow, what power! The men watching this film back in (ca) 1940 must have had to cover their laps.I leave it to those with a sense of adventure to debate the movie's homoeroticism. There's no such implications from Beutel toward the two older men.The movie, finally, has to be taken for the time in which it was made. The cinematography is as splendid as if it were turned 10 years ago. It is impossibly uneven, anecdotal, horrifyingly edited, pathetically scored, wretchedly acted...yet the actors are painful in their beauty. Many of the IMDb comments suggest that the film wants watching several times. I second that. It can be slow, cantankerous, giddy, sullen - but Jane's and Jack's beauty are undeniable, Walter is everybody's favorite grandfather. Toland can be thanked for giving us the movie's clarity. --And Howard... Howard was just having fun.

Billy the Kid was every kid's hero in those days. But the posters of Jane Russell was the main reason that I risked getting caught. She didn't let me down. Her first film, and it showed, but wow, she was a creature from another planet. I'd certainly seen nothing like her. Having been brought up on Johnny Mac Brown, the Durango kid, and the like, this film was, at the time, a revelation. My pals all wanted to know how fast Billy was. Did he shoot Doc Holliday? Did Pat Garrett shoot him in the back? All I wanted to do was describe Jane Russell.I watched The Outlaw on TV this week, and was disappointed. Time had done it no favours. The background music, which I hadn't noticed the first time round, was truly dreadful (Tchaikovsky was it? mixed with cartoon type sounds) I still found myself admiring Russell, who for most red blooded males of my age has been a great inspiration. Like Shane, and others, I think this was a film of its time, and probably doesn't deserve to be judged by this generation, who are seeing it for the first time.

Hyped to the hilt. Howard Hawks directs with the aid of Howard Hughes. This western depicts the relationships between Billy the Kid(Jack Buetel),Doc Holliday(Walter Huston) and Sheriff Pat Garrett(Thomas Mitchell). Cowboys, Indians and gun play are not the main feature...the debut of Jane Russell is! This movie was filmed in 1941, but it took two years to pass the censors due to the shameless display of Russell's ample assets(36D). Aircraft pioneer Hughes actually designed the bra that helps showcase Russell. This is also Buetel's debut; but Huston is the one to prove his screen greatness. Probably the first sex western. Of course the fade outs leave a lot to the imagination. Worth the ballyhoo.

Thus an awful film can sometimes provide more entertainment than many good films. (THE DEVIL BAT, starring Bela Lugosi, comes to mind.)  Watched THE OUTLAW on DVD the other night with some friends, and we were falling off the couch.  I'd always heard there was a homoerotic subtext to the picture, but this was no subtext -- gay porn must be more subtle than this film!  Walter Huston's Doc Holliday (or Halliday -- I've seen it spelled both ways in regard to this picture) is CLEARLY the stud, Billy is a petulant young hustler who piques his interest (despite his having stolen the older man's cherished horse!), and Thomas Mitchell's Pat Garrett (Doc's oldestfriend) seethes with jealousy throughout until he degenerates into the very apotheosis of a passed over, frantic, shrieking old queen. You're not going with him!  Everything was fine between us till he came along!  It has to be seen to be believed.  Hilarious! The film's musical score is the worst -- THE WORST -- I've ever heard.  There's less Mickey-Mousing in a Three Stooges short. So I recommend this one highly for parties.  I guarantee a laugh riot.  The thought of the great cinemotagrapher Gregg Toland (CITIZEN KANE) laboring on such camp trash is depressing, but he did give the film a fine look.

Frankly, I don't understand what all of the hubbub is about. The film is absolutely dreadful. Great talent (Walter Huston and Thomas Mitchell) is wasted in this film with an 'identity crisis'.  It doesn't know if it wants to be a western, or a romance, or a comedy. Maybe it did introduce Jane Russell to the screen, but that appears to be the only justification for making this celluloid nightmare. Her acting talents are virtually non-existent, though she looks good. Jack Beutel is forgettable as 'Billy the Kid', and he gives an un-inspired performance that is something far beyond lackluster. One gets the feeling he is reading his lines 'cold' from cue cards. The film moves very slowly, is not particularly well written ( despite its hightly acclaimed screenwriter credits), is dreadfully acted, and is a very difficult watch, almost the equivalent of Chinese Water Torture. Fortunately, the film never takes itself seriously. And it's a good thing. It isn't the kind of film to be taken seriously !! I would recommend that it be shown in maximum security prisons as a substitute for lethal injection ! The film stunk then, it still stinks, and if it's part of film history, it isn't one of the high points, and the student of film needn't spend too much time here. The creative Victor Young music score and the innovative cinematography of Gregg Toland make the film watchable, but aren't enough to salvage this dreadnaught. Hughes shouldn'a had'da ought'a done it !! He should have hired a REAL director to crack the whip, and he should have taken the gag and handcuffs off of the writer and restored him to his artistic creativity. This didn't happen. Instead, some of the best talent of the period--both in front of and behind the camera--is wasted, and what masquerades to some as film history is seen by this writer as 'Film Misery'!!

I would have preferred to see less of Pat Garrett and Doc Holliday, and more of Jane Russell. Even in the circumcised 95 min version i saw, there are shots of her cleavage, very rare for a 1943 film. There are other aspects of the movie which make it racy even by today's standards one scene which made it to the most censored version involves something we don't see again till 1970 (Altman's MASH), far as i know. A man is sick, Russell is told he may die, she starts undressing, tells the maid to leave the room and tells the sick man I'll warm you up.At times like this, there is a total fadeout to black and the music cuts out - something which never happens elsewhere in the movie. Its not hard to pick where bits have been cut out. I'd love to see the full version, available on the Criterion DVD. Plus, the transfer on the cheapie DVD i've got is not good, and Criterion always do a great transfer.The sex caused the production enough trouble, however - getting it banned in several countries, and neutered in the US. Still, there are enough scenes of Russell looking gorgeous here to recommend it to you for that alone (best bits Russell standing in front of a mirror, riding a horse, wearing that green shirt, getting wet... you get the idea). The shot of Russell in The Outlaw's photo gallery gives you an idea of the sultry sexuality Russell had. That's a publicity still, though, so she looks slighty more natural in the movie. The western-adventure plot is impoverished and eventually turns into a love triangle with Russell, which i would have recommended to Hughes instead of trying a straight western adventure. He clearly cared most about women and aviation, and since this movie involved no planes, he needed plenty of sex to keep him interested. Hughes's frame only comes alive when Russell is on screen. Luckily, she comes on screen quite often. Still, it never seems like enough. The only interest the other characters (none other than Pat Garrett, Billy the Kid and Doc Holliday) serve is watching how often their eyes stray to Russell's bust when they're in a scene with her.Unexpectedly comic moment in a shootout, one man refuses to draw, so the other shoots a big hole in his hand and out of his ears and he doesn't even react, as if he didn't feel it. I don't care how tough you are, you're gonna feel pain if you lose half an ear to a bullet.

Best known as the film debut of a very bosomy Jane Russell, the movie actually describes a completely fictionalized friendship between Billy the Kid (Jack Beutel) and Doc Holliday (Walter Huston). According to the story, Holliday arrives in the town of Lincoln, NM and meets up with his old buddy Sheriff Pat Garrett (Thomas Mitchell.) Their friendship is strained when Billy shows up on the scene and Holliday becomes more involved with him. That's really where the weirdness comes in. Although Billy and Holliday are supposedly in a romantic competition for Rio (Russell), this really comes across as a 3-cornered homo-erotic relationship, with Holliday jilting Garrett for Billy. In the scenes between any combination of the three of them, that's really the sense you get of the relationship. It's truly bizarre to watch, which is perhaps not surprising for a movie produced and directed by Howard Hughes, who was already in a period of significant mental decline while he was putting this out. Hughes' OCD undoubtedly led to the very realistic and surprisingly detailed sets, but there was a lot that didn't fit well at all - including a dreadful musical score and some ham-fisted attempts at humour. The movie also includes surprisingly little gunplay for a Western. There's really not very much of interest here, but for Russell's sheer beauty as well as the over the top bizarre-ness of the whole thing, it gets a 4/10.

I don't think so either . Her smouldering sexuality is the yardstick in which to judge all woman on Earth and the likes of Monroe are second best when compared to this definitive sex goddess . And to think some people describe the likes of Jay-Lo or Abi Titmuss as the most beautiful woman who has ever lived Unfortunately Ms Russell is the only thing THE OUTLAW is remembered for , which is by no means a bad thing since this is an absolutely terrible movie . From the opening scene featuring a sheriff who gives a performance that resembles a circus clown giving a portrayal of a homo-erotic wet dream to the final credits this movie is an ordeal to sit through . It's badly directed with tons of very poor acting and ridiculous back projection and is so factually incorrect as to be laughable . Did I say it was laughable ? Maybe that's why the musical score has a comedy soundtrack complete with a WAH WAH WAH WAH sound that belongs in a three stooges feature ?I would have happily given THE OUTLAW one out of ten but because of the presence of Russell we're treated to something of a movie landmark - We're treated to on screen sex . Billy The Kid ravishes Rio Mcdonald in a hay loft 30 years before Clint Eastwood did an identical scene in HIGH PLAINS DRIFTER and in a later scene Rio asks Billy if he'll look at her while he does it , and the audience is left in no doubt what  It  is .

Once you make an effort to penetrate the rough exterior and get the feel of it, you will agree that it is an unforgettable summit of achievement by all involved.In particular, there are two prominent points that engage my attention. One of these is the complexity of the interaction between the four principal characters. They are forever brooding over the most murderous resentments, then turning around and forming alliances, often amorous. This continual shifting of balance is what drives The Haunting (1963), and is what gives this movie its peculiar interest. Most westerns from that era have good guys versus bad guys, very boring; here we actually get something to think about. The characters are clearly defined individuals, and they behave with consistency.The other point is the musical soundtrack - it is the worst, I mean the very worst, in any movie. Tchaikovsky has never been so foully misused. Doubtless this was due to Howard Hughes' lack of taste, but the guy deserves some thanks for funding a movie no-one else would have touched back then. If the movie is ever re-released on DVD, there should be the option of squelching the music.Critics who knock the movie draw particular attention to the wooden acting of Jane Russell, but it seems just right for her part - smouldering with resentment and desire, but all of it suppressed by her need to fulfil her social role.So ignore the sniping from the boobs elsewhere at this site, and give The Outlaw a chance to capture you!

It's notoriety simultaneously launched Jane Russell's career as a sex symbol and hurt her career as an actress.The overblown hype surrounding Jane's breasts, the film's reputation for being a vanity project for billionaire Howard Hughes, and the high expectations attached to anything directed by Howard Hawks weighs heavily on ones enjoyment of The Outlaw, but this is essentially just a long 1940's style B-western.When viewed through that prism it's fairly decent, if unspectacular entertainment with good performances by the stars.

A couple of points This film shows how much damage a bad musical score can do to a movie. This idiot composer thinks he's creating a new Tchaikovsky symphony (in fact he plagiarizes whole pages from some of Tchaikovsky's best-known works). The music is hyperactive, overbearing, overblown, and ludicrously inappropriate to this tough, unsentimental frontier story.What does come across clearly is the powerful sex appeal of the two leads. Jane Russell, a former dental hygienist, supplies a sultry presence and bountiful bosoms in a pre-silicone era when such an endowment was really something special.Less remarked-on is Jack Buetel, an insurance clerk who, unlike Russell, failed to become a star after this film. But no question he is one of the sexiest young men ever to appear in a Hollywood movie.Some posters refer to THE OUTLAW's homoerotic qualities. I don't see anything like that in the story, but Buetel exudes such a powerful sensuality, he singlehandedly casts a homoerotic glow over the production.Note I just read Wikipedia's article on Buetel. It says Hawks wanted the young actor for RED RIVER, but Hughes wouldn't let him do it, so he cast Montgomery Clift insteadThe film producer Cubby Broccoli who had worked with Hughes on The Outlaw, explained the reason that Buetel's career had been allowed to stagnate. He said that Hughes had coerced Buetel into a sexual relationship that began before filming started and which continued occasionally for the duration of Buetel's seven year contract. Broccoli explained that Buetel had refused to perform certain sexual acts and as a result had angered and frustrated Hughes, who was accustomed to aspiring actors and actresses being more compliant. The relationship was also described similarly by the author Lawrence Quirk, and by the assistant cameraman on The Outlaw, Lucien Ballard.Wow, Scorsese should have used that to spice up THE AVIATOR, huh? LOL.THE OUTLAW is no one's idea of a good movie, but it's worth checking out (even if you only see part of it)for Russell's auspicious, bodacious debut and moments, here and there, when the story actually works.

The first time, I resisted. I watched with amazement&#x85; this movie has an incredible look. I suppose it's a film made in the '40s, seen mostly in the '50s, looking very much like an early '30s talkie - but, ACTED IN SLOW MOTION! I wanted to dislike the film, but I really could not. I loved the saloon - reading the visible graffiti on the walls, never knowing who was going to shoot who, when, why...When Mr. Buetel and Ms. Russell tumble in the hay, I recognized the scene from a dozen subsequent westerns; yet, it seemed suspenseful the way Mr. Hughes shot it here. I could not really state there is a rape (others may); and, I think, later scenes imply there was no rape. I believe the scene simply ended with her shirt torn.There certainly is a lot of ambiguity! I agree there are some lines between the male actors which could be taken sexually. I caught those upon viewing the film during a second sitting. Early on, Mr. Huston wonders if Mr. Buetel might want to bunk with him if he doesn't have a girl. BUT, Huston has Russell already lined up. There is also the age old question of whether the western hero needs his horse, or his girl, more. Of course, the western hero picks his horse! I believe these ambiguities add to the enjoyment of the film. They are additional things to think about during repeated viewing. During my second viewing, I just enjoyed the movie more&#x85; it's just so unusually interesting. With all classic films, I think about different meanings, and things going on&#x85; this movie has the ability to grow stronger thematically with repeated viewings. That's something I look for when rating a movie highly. A movie can take on a life of its own.I love the performances&#x85; Mr. Mitchell and Huston are older, more experienced actors while Buetel and Russell are younger. They all work well together. I especially enjoy Billy and Rio as she nurses him to health. The most recent viewing (today) had me wondering about how the peculiar look of this film was achieved. It's very claustrophobic, but has some location stuff. I watched those scenes more carefully. I watched Mr. Buetel's guns during his exchange near the end. I noticed Ms. Russell's attire became more alluring with each scene.I noticed the tombstone closing HERE LIES&#x85; The tombstone is a LIE. Could this play on words have been intended? This is a film I would call chance art. I have no idea what effect the filmmakers were looking for - was it just intended as a showcase for Jane Russell's attributes? That was achieved. All the rest is icing. I submit that The Outlaw creates a unique and entertaining world of its own. The four main performers are riveting. I think The Outlaw is a world worth repeated revisiting.Next, I need to keep my eyes on Billy the Kid's ears, and see when the blood drops appear on his shirt. ********** The Outlaw (2/5/43) Howard Hughes ~ Jack Buetel, Jane Russell, Walter Huston, Thomas Mitchell "},{"Title":"Almost too weird to adequately describe.","Date":"28 December 2003","Score":"11 out of 18 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Drama, Romance","Review":"  In all my many years (80) on this planet, I have never seen a movie that comes close to challenging ones senses as The Outlaw.

Mr. Hughes or someone took over direction and gave us the finished product which is a mess but a lot of fun just the same.The build-up of Jane Russell (no pun intended) was one of the great publicity moves in film history. That famous shot of her lolling around on a bale of hay with her famous chest falling about was enough to entice most red-blooded males to this film And she didn't disappoint as Rio, the girlfriend of many, faithful to none. Throw in Pat Garrett, Billy the Kid and Doc Holliday (where did he come from?) and you've got a mix of relationships that vies with Brokeback Mountain for male bonding. And just for the hell of it, add some Indians which cause our heroes to embark in a cloud of dust across the landscape.I found Jack Buetel (or Beutel) a rather attractive actor in a wispy kind of way. Jane Russell's chest probably weighed more than he did. Unfortunately he never recovered from this film outing and sank into oblivion This film is about as coherent as a Marx Brothers romp but not nearly as intentionally funny. The whole thing is contrived, there's a lot of talk, talk, talk, and if there is some underlying message, I missed it.

With Hughes' generally obsessive attention to detail in his aeronautical career, you would think that at least some integrity would be maintained with names and dates for historical accuracy, but nothing about the film makes any kind of sense at all. Only Jack Beutel as Billy the Kid comes close to matching his character's age at the time of events in the story. In 1881, Pat Garrett would have been thirty one years old, but Thomas Mitchell was fifty one when the movie was made. An even greater disparity exists with Walter Huston's Doc Holliday; at fifty nine, Huston was almost twice his character's age of thirty. And with all that, the grave marker showing Billy the Kid's 'death' on July 13, 1881 (he actually died on the 14th, but that was Doc Holliday in the grave), how would one explain Doc's resurrection to take part in the Gunfight at OK Corral (10/26/1881)? In all, just a complete mess regarding history.What's not a mess is Jane Russell's film debut as Rio McDonald, Doc's girlfriend turned Billy's lover. Oh baby, how hot was she? At nineteen, it's a toss up as to who had the more sizzling screen presence, Russell here or Lauren Bacall in her first picture, To Have and Have Not. I'm willing to call it a tie. But there again, Hughes had to go for that over the top close up of Russell's lips about to kiss Billy, it almost demands a laugh out loud reaction. And how about all those goofy Warner Brothers type cartoon music moments; didn't ANYONE have a clue that they didn't fit with the story? You know, I'm usually the first to dismiss reactions to a film dealing with alleged homo erotic subtexts, but I have to agree with other reviewers on this board regarding the relationship between Doc and Pat Garrett. There's that conversation between the two just before Garrett takes out Holliday that's just mind blowing in it's suggestion. Just another element that digresses the entire story into never-never land.I think what might have given this picture half a chance would have been to keep the famous gunslinger names completely out of it. Then at least you could have made a case for a somewhat offbeat Western. Still, I don't care how you might attempt to rationalize it, there's no way anyone in his right mind would take a strawberry roan in trade for Jane Russell.

The camera never moves and the actors don't move either. It is also surely the most flagrantly flaming movie of the Code Era, with the possible exception of COBRA WOMAN. Let's see, there's the triangle of a literally limp-wristed Doc (Hughes shows us this about five times to make sure everyone gets it), an sputtering old rejected Pat, and an energetic hot young buck (Billy) who also has time for Jane Russell. The three men do a lot of glaring at one another while they read innuendo-ridden lines in innuendo-laden blockings. The wah-wah-wah kicks in on the soundtrack whenever there's a really smoldery glare or argument. And so on. They do everything but hold hands. Russell isn't exactly beautiful by '40s movie standards, but she certainly is ripe. Hughes had the money to ignore the Censor, and watching it you can't help but wonder if all this wasn't meant as a joke on Mr. Breen himself. This movie is a little funnier if you see THE AVIATOR first.

I do know he was bat-shiat crazy. So the constant betrayal and backstabbing and shifting alliances are easy to see coming from his frightened mind. As a technical worker Hughes was also an Asperger's sufferer, who values things more than human relationships and can't understand humans anyway. So we see a pouch of tobacco and a horse traded around as casually as they do Jane Russell. Did anyone mention Johnny Carson's introduction of her on his show? Here they are, Jane Russell. What disturbed me was her voice over-- what do you call it-- Foley stage? She sounds like a 12-year-old. Its quite off-putting and makes the creepiness of Hollywood shine through.So the lack of human motivations and operations give this a one star. But even if Howard Hughes knew how human beings felt or operated, the musical score would get this a one-star. Good gosh, is veered between over-dramatic Hitchcock and the Three Stooges (wha whaa whaaaa). In between was what others have described as bad Tchaikovsky. As you would expect for the guy that gave us Citizen Kane, the cinematography was pretty good. I bet I would have liked this a lot better if I turned off the sound. Closed-captioning would be far preferable to the wooden delivery and bad score.Double triple spoiler-- I do love the effect when Doc shoots big chunks out of Billy's ears. We need more of this in-camera stuff, CGI is boring me to tears.Now that the film is ending, I think of that guy that said it only makes sense if Pat, Doc, and Billy are gay, and he may have a point. But let's face it, if any real 1940s homosexuals were behind this film, it would be 100 times better.Quadruple spoiler-- Its nice that Doc dies saying he don't want to die in bed, and Val Kilmer picks up the meme in Tombstone.As a movie this is execrable, but as an exploration into the mind of a paranoid schizophrenic Asperger suffer, it is a real treasure. I love how Hughes makes all the elements of a Jane Russell soft-core porno, since he has so little understanding of human beings he thinks that is the only reason we would watch this. Then again, maybe he was right. "},{"Title":" Take a slice of Western History and put it into a blender, . .

Take this film for instance, the original script was written by Jules Furthman, for a special project directed by none other than Howard Hughes. The movie is called  The Outlaw  and is supposedly one of a few the late Hughes touted as his best. However, playing fast and loose with history is sure to cause historians to scratch their heads. In this fanciful tale, audiences are treated to a make believe story wherein we have two western legends 'Billy the Kid' aka, William Bonny (Jack Beutel) and 'Doc Holiday' aka, John Henry Holiday (Walter Huston) arriving in Lincoln, New Mexico and becoming fast friends. Unlikely as that is, we are also treated to Sheriff Pat Garrett (Thomas Mitchell) who comes to dislike both men. Not because they are outlaws, but because they form a closer bond which many suggest boarders on the suspicious. Jane Russell is the Buxom bombshell Rio McDonald, who was the surprising sex-sensation and X-rated Eye-candy of the 1940s. The actors are likable enough and carry the fictional story along to it's rather slow, almost torturous ending. The motion picture has its ardent proponents, which equal it's cinematic detractors. However, the special reason why this film is sought after is due to its depiction of Jan Russell in a 'super' bra (Which she never wore). Indeed, I watched the movie with anticipation and realized in the year 2010 we have a whole plethora of Full-Figure' want-to-be's who've revealed more than Russell ever did.

However an encounter with young Billy the Kid brings conflict between the two men, breaking their friendship and seeing Holliday and Billy becoming companions. With Garrett still eager to bring in Billy, things escalate and Billy is seriously injured in a gunfight. Fleeing the scene with Holliday, Billy is cared for by Doc's girlfriend, the sultry Rio McDonald and she finds herself falling for the Kid's good looks. However it is only a matter of time before the conflict must be resolved one way or another.With The Aviator in cinemas and up for many awards I decided to revisit this film since all Aviator had to say about it was the controversy over Russell's breasts. To me it highlights how fleeting films based on controversy or hype are because it is not long before the hype has passed or what was once shockingly sexual now just appears quaint and flat. Indeed, aside from that one iconic image, the sex appeal is not really present anymore and the sparks that audiences might once have seen were just not there for me. What this leaves is a rather boring western that lacks emotional involvement, genuine excitement or serious character interplay that parts of the narrative really needed. The film is damaged further by a musical score that is passable at best, intrusive and annoying at worst; the best example of this being the horrible comic effects during the scene where Doc and Billy debate the merits of Rio versus Doc's horse.The cast all fell second to Russell's breasts during production and marketing of the film and, with the impact of that double-act reduced with time, it just leaves them to at least be able to be watched without distraction. For all the hype, I am always surprised by just how plain and clunky I find Russell's performance &#150; she isn't sultry or that sexy and her looks tend towards the plain rather than the attractive (for my tastes anyway). Buetel is OK as Billy but his performance is just passable and does the minimum rather than developing his character beyond the arrogant exterior. Huston's Holliday is a bit more enjoyable as he seems to be touched with a bit of weary humour that would have come with survival to that age; he plays it well and he is the best thing in the film. Mitchell offered potential in his role but he is only given an one-note character to play and didn't convince me as a real person.Overall, regardless of the hype and the famous scenes, this is an average western with plotting and characters that don't really engage on more than a basic level. The sensation too startling to describe has lost its impact with time and it has exposed the film's weaknesses rather harshly. The actors are OK but the material never allows them to do anything in a story that ambles along rather than doing anything interesting or engaging; meanwhile the musical score tends towards the obtrusive and annoying rather than adding value to the film. Controversy may make a film famous but it doesn't make it good.

Perhaps it is in some parallel universe, but Hughes' tale bears no relation to history.  This William Bonney is a hunk who charms children and naive women, has a temper, but also a convoluted sense of honor, is self-reliant and suspicious of everyone, and only kills when provoked.  Uh-hunh.None of this matters, anyway.  This is the debut film of Jane Russell, one of the most beautiful women ever to grace a movie screen, and this movie is all about Jane.  The tagline for this movie is Mean, Moody, Magnificent, and, trust me, they aren't talking about Bonney!  Posters advertising the film show a drawing of Russell in a skirt slit to the waist, showing a shapely thigh, and reclining languorously in hayloft, brandishing a six-gun. There are publicity pictures of Russell for scenes that do not appear anywhere in this film.  I'll come back to some memorable scenes that do appear in a moment, but what we have here is unabashed pandering to the macho erotic fantasies of the 1940's American male to sell movie tickets. There is little promotion of this movie as a movie, and it's not hard to figure why.  Besides Ms. Russell's voluptuous figure, there is not much here.But, in the movie's most memorable scene, Rio stalks Bonney for killing her brother, ambushes him in a barn, is herself caught and subdued by Bonney. Then raped.  We don't see it, of course, but her clothes are torn by Bonney, and he was on top of her doing it.  This wasn't a genteel courtship.There was a second memorable scene that was also quite stirring and suggestive for its day.  Bonney is shot by Garrett, and taken by Doc Holliday to Rio's home for some TLC.  His wound exits without damaging vital organs, but the trauma induces first fever then chills, and no amount of blankets will keep the Kid warm.  So, Rio does what married couples have been doing forever to stay warm.  Only she and the Kid aren't married. (Except in her heart, but that's a digression.)  She takes off her shoes, and something I swear was hosiery, there is a discreet dissolve, and, miraculously, the next day the wounded Mr. Bonney is well enough to leave the bed!This movie with those scenes and maybe others more risque now lost caused quite the furor in the 1940's.  They are tame by today's standards.  Maybe what was most outrageous about this movie was Hughes' shameless promotion of Russell, because there was not even a token attempt at subtlety or discretion.If you're still reading to this point, you've no doubt noticed we've stopped talking about Billy the Kid.  We can't without spoiling the movie.  I'll just repeat what I said above about this Billy living in a parallel universe, because he doesn't meet the end our history books say he did. Well, kinda, sorta.  You'll just have to see the picture.Oh, I hated the intrusive Victor Young score, the dialogue was affected, amateurish, and cliched, and the plot was turgid and almost impossible to follow.  5 out of 10, and only that high because of the eye-candy.

The temptation to knock this production is tempting because so many great artists were involved at the behest of the wealthiest rank amateur of all time. Not satisfied with original director Howard Hawks' vision, Hughes fired the esteemed film maker and took over the directorial reigns (and in the process compromising the artistic quality of the film by being distracted by production red tape.) What emerged on the screen is a what might have been variation of The Billy the Kid legend, and in spite of pedestrian direction a fine cast makes the proceedings bearable. Walter Huston and Thomas Mitchell do their very best but are at the mercy of Hughes' guiding hand, where it seems as though each actor is just a few seconds behind a beat in responding to the other. Jack Beutel, a handsome newcomer playing Billy, has a smoldering presence that seems to be a harbinger of Brando and Dean, but he is thwarted by a lack of focus thanks to Mr. Hughes. As for the love scenes, they have an undeniable fascination and one can imagine this was hot stuff for the 1940s! Taken for what it is , this western is at best a curiosity, peopled with some of Hollywood's most remarkable talent . Cinematographer Gregg Toland gives the picture a great look in black and white and Hughes penchant for using classical music ( Tchaikovsky's Adagio from his 6th Symphony graces the opening credits and Russell's steamy love scene!) gives this somnolent oater a touch of class.

Something went very wrong with the script, even though it was written by Jules Furthman, who had To Have and Have Not and The Big Sleep to his credit and with the help of Ben Hecht, uncredited.

She certainly looks great and director Howard Hughes is more than happy to let the camera linger on her fine female form. But breasts can only take a movie so far. It's not worth sitting through 2 hours of absolute dreck to sneak a few peeks of a babe in a low-cut blouse.The story in this movie never grabs your interest, it's a dull movie pretty much beginning to end. Matters are not helped by some truly wretched acting. Jack Buetel, playing famed outlaw Billy the Kid, is just terrible. He's stiff, unnatural and has all the personality of a block of wood. Meanwhile Russell has little to offer besides her ample bosom. She may have gone on to a respectable acting career but here, in the movie which made her a star, it is safe to say she had not yet honed her craft. The movie relies on there being some kind of spark between Russell's character, Rio, and Billy the Kid. Sadly two rather inept performances mean there is no spark at all. That relationship falls flat, the whole movie follows suit. Reliable Hollywood veterans Walter Huston, playing Doc Holliday, and Thomas Mitchell who plays Sheriff Pat Garrett come off better than Buetel and Russell. But even they can't really make much of what is a rather lousy script. The movie takes real-life characters and tosses them into a completely made-up story. You'd think if you were going to make up a story you would at least make up an interesting one. No such luck. The movie is a real snoozer. Anytime there threatens to be even a little bit of heat between Rio and Billy censorship standards of the 1940s dictate an awkward cut away before we actually see anything. The story and the acting are laughable throughout which means the absurdly cartoonish score fits right in. Hard to take anything seriously with that absurd music blaring the whole time. It all leads up to a conclusion which is just impossibly bad, by this point you're definitely laughing at the movie, not with it.

I didn't know who Howard Hughes was at the time, and now that I do, I think he should have kept to designing airplanes.Its a shame that two academy award winning actors used up their time and talent on such a terrible movie. I would only recommend seeing this film, to see how bad it is. The only memorable item about this movie centered around breasts and bras, and today seems like a tempest in a tea pot.

I think that in addition to this there is another and perhaps more interesting story.John Huston, the legendary Hollywood director and Walter's son, had a particular style characters were always thoroughly human in having a mixture of very human feelings as well as very human flaws tempered by patchy decency. His best known films The African Queen, the Maltese Falcon and his last The Man Who Would be King have a warmth coming from central perhaps odd robust friendships which survive, or are made under, testing circumstances where each regard the other with a degree of uncertainty, each measuring how much they can trust the other.The Outlaw in which his father, Walter Huston starred, is perhaps Hollywood's, even cinema's most extreme example - an intense 4-sided affair between 3 males and one female. In fact it's 5-sided - one of the characters is a horse..... Each, except the horse, must choose who, including the horse, they want to be with - the humour and oddity of the situation is entirely intentional. The last 15 minutes is particularly intense, witty, superbly written and acted with Walter Huston outstanding. Its certainly plausible that the plot was very influential on son John Huston.There is another connection which just might be made. The extremely odd situation of a love triangle in which gender (and even species) is irrelevant and love also at times violently rejected, was already very familiar to the American public but in a different form. In 1913 an oddball comic strip was started which featured an intense triangle between Krazy (a besotted cat), Ignatz (a hateful and hurtful mouse) and Officer Pup (a love-sick sheriff dog) The strip's name was Krazy Kat. Such was its popularity that many film cartoons were made in the 1920s and the strip itself lasted until 1944 and is still venerated by enthusiasts.

Doc Holliday (Walter Huston) has a falling out with Pat Garrett (Thomas Mitchell) after he sides with Billy the Kid (Jack Buetel). Billy and Doc become friends and head off but they are soon battling over a woman (Jane Russell) as well as constantly having Garrett trying to track them down. The aspects of this that were shocking in 1943 are pretty much tame and dated by today's standards but what I found so shocking about THE OUTLAW is how poorly made it was and how many awful things here in it. I don't mind the changes in history that the film made but for the life of me I couldn't understand what Hughes was trying to do with this thing other than to show off Russell's big breasts. I found the screenplay to be a complete mess as it never seems to know what it wants to do or what type of story it wants to tell. Is it meant to be a real Western? If so why are there so many silly moments? Was it meant to be a silly comedy? Well, that's fine but if so why on Earth were there so many darker moments? The movie contains one of the worst scores in Hollywood history as the thing is embarrassingly bad. The thing is over dramatic when there's nothing going on in the scene and sometimes the score is so loud and over-the-top that you can't even hear the dialogue. The film has also become legendary due to the homosexual aspect of the story. Again, I'm not certainly a love triangle between Billy, Garrett and Holliday is what Hughes was going for but that's how it comes off. I'm going to guess this is just part of the film being poorly made because at times the three men seem to be flirting more with one another and just letting Russell be on her own. The film has some really weird and out of touch comedic moments including various sound effects that happen during times when something serious or dramatic is going on. As far as the performances go, Huston comes off the best as he at least seems to be trying to give a performance. Buetel has no personality and comes off very stiff and appears to be bored. Mitchell was a fine character actor but he's miscast here and is never believable in the part. As far as Russell goes, she certainly looks beautiful and I enjoy the fact that Hughes wanted to show off her certain parts but he didn't give her much of a chance to act as she's simply used as eye candy. Hughes direction is all over the place and in the end he delivers a pretty big turkey. I understand this movie having a cult following due to its reputation and troubled history but for the life of me I can't understand some of the positive reviews I've read.

I went into it with only Leonard Maltin's book as a guide, plus clips showing Jane Russell's heaving bosom.I can certainly see why the film may have set on the shelves for a while, but I've certainly seen far worse movies (westerns and otherwise) that seem to pop up on television continually, while being far less interesting than this.  Even after watching it on DVD (Platinum Edition's The Great American Western collection) I'm not sure how I feel about it.I don't think it's 'bad' so much as confusing and a bit unsure of itself. In some ways it reminds me of SANTA FE TRAIL, where the director isn't quite sure what he's trying to do.  Both films jump from light hearted to melodrama to straight action and back with little time for the audience to get settled in.Now Maltin's book indicates that there are several versions of the film in release, but none of the original 'uncensored' 117 minute version.The edition I saw had Russell (playing Rio)and Jack Buetel (as Billy the Kid) rolling in hay in a barn (after Rio attempts to shoot Billy for killing her brother), they are completely hidden by shadow, but Billy makes a comment along the lines of Quit struggling lady or I'll rip all of your dress off.  This seems to indicate that Billy rapes her, although the scene ends on that note and we next see Billy the next morning.  What's left in the 'uncensored' version? This certainly seems pretty blatant considering the movie code at the time.In a later scene, Rio is apparently going to give herself to Billy willingly, but the camera angle used has her about to give oral to the camera lens, until the scene is interrupted by the arrival of her aunt.Now unless there are scenes missing from the version I have the famous poster shot of Russell with her dress ripped and off the shoulder, doesn't appear in the film.Anyway, the movie is not as bad as some folks make it out to be, although it would have been interesting if Howard Hawks had been given free hand, without interference (and eventual credit taken) by Howard Hughes.  Of course, it is certainly easy to see how Hughes could be taken with Russell, who is absolutely beautiful (and full figured) in this film.

It's not long before Holliday comes across Billy the Kid (Jack Buetel), who seems to be riding Holliday's horse that he had stolen from him in a previous town. Holliday however, takes a liking to the cocky Kid much to the annoyance of Garrett. When the Kid kills a man that pulls a gun on him first, Garrett shoots the Kid but Holliday escapes with him, taking him to Rio's (Jane Russell) place. Rio is Holliday's lady but as she is tending to his wounds, she finds herself unable to resist the Kid's charms.Multi-millionaire playboy and aviator Howard Hughes only made two films in his life (although he produced many more). I've not seen his first film, Hell's Angels (1930), which is a love-song to aviation, but this, an unconventional cross-genre western, shows his complete inexperience in the role of director. Apart from the blatant historical inaccuracies (which I'll forgive, given the film is clearly not striving for it), Hughes seems unable to decide what genre he wants the film to be. Is it a comedy? A drama? A romance? Who knows? One thing is clear, he is fascinated by Jane Russell's ample bosom. He felt that the film was not doing her breasts justice, and so he designed an early wonderbra that accentuated them. This generated lots of controversy, and led to the film only getting a limited release as it fell foul of the censors.Clearly, Hughes knows that Jane Russell's sexual appeal is all that the film has going for it, judging by the posters. Apart from the terrible script and dodgy pacing, the acting is absolutely woeful. Jack Buetel, clearly hired for his looks alone, has less charisma about him than the horses he rides on. In fact, the horses have more facial expressions. Jane Russell, who would go on to be a massive star, demonstrates none of her acting ability and feistiness that she would become known for. In fairness, she is given nothing to do other than bend over Buetel with her cleavage visible, and pout occasionally when required.The most confusing thing about this film is how Hughes expects us to like these characters. Pat Garrett is supposed to the 'bad' guy, jealous and furious over Holliday choosing to ride off with Billy the Kid. Yet as he pursues the Kid, who is by the way, a known thief and murderer, Doc Holliday shoots and kills many of Garrett's men. But somehow we are supposed to sympathise with Holliday and forget that he is a mass- murderer. It all plays out like some weird, homoerotic love story, with Garrett playing the jealous wife to Holliday's husband who has chosen to run off with Billy the Kid's younger, more exciting toyboy. The only female character of note, Rio, acts like a lost little girl who can't exist without a man's arm to lean on. The Kid treats her like s**t, and even tries to trade her for a horse, yet she remains enamoured with him, running after him when he 'allows' her to come with him. It's just a very strange, confused film. And also a very bad one.

And, believe me, director Howard Hughes sure made damn certain that her cleavage-enhancing blouses revealed as much of her bountiful bosom as the censors would legally allow.Actually filmed in 1941, it took Hughes 2 solid years of battling with the censor board to allow The Outlaw to be released as it was (which was unbelievably tame by today's standards).As you can well-imagine, all of this legal wrangling with the censors over Jane's exposed cleavage did absolute wonders for this film as far as free publicity goes.

The plot, by Furthman, a regular collaborator of Hawks, has Buetel as Billy the Kid and Huston as Doc Holliday, quarreling over Russell and being trailed by Mitchell's Pat Garrett. But the film's centre of interest, certainly the key element in its promotion, was ex-dentist's receptionist Russell and her bust, made even more prominent by Hughes' specially designed cantilevered brassi√®re - 'What are the two reasons for Jane Russel's rise to stardom?' ran one ad campaign.Yet ironically, Hughes, in his depiction of Russel's Mexican spitfire, stresses that she is unimportant except as the possessor of large breasts for the viewer to ogle. At one point in the film, Huston and Buetel argue whether Russell or a horse should be the winnings in a card game they've just finished they decide on a horse as being more valuable!

The shifting relationships where no-one can really trust or rely on any-one else, the unshaven faces, and the dragging out of scenes to create tension are all hallmarks of Sergio Leone's movies with Clint Eastwood.2) Contrary to popular legend, Jane Russell's cleavage is displayed only occasionally.3) The first half of the scene in the barn between Billy and Rio was re-used by screenwriter Jules Furthman in Rio Bravo when Sheriff Chance goes into a stable in pursuit of a gunman.

The story concerns gunfighter Doc Holliday (Walter Huston), outlaw Billy the Kid (Jack Buetel), and lawman Pat Garrett (Thomas Mitchell). Basically it goes like this Pat and Doc are friends.

So then the four of them are all circling each other and liking or not liking each other as the plot calls for. Historically speaking it's pretty laughable but it's a movie not a documentary so I give it a wide berth on factual accuracy.Walter Huston and Thomas Mitchell are both screen legends. They've done better than this but they still do good work here, elevating an otherwise pedestrian movie to something watchable. Busty Jane Russell makes her screen debut here. She's gorgeous, of course, but the role requires little else of her. Also, despite her being the primary selling point for this movie for over half a century, she's not the star. Jack Buetel also makes his screen debut but nobody remembers him for anything other than this. He didn't do another movie until the '50s and then some TV work for a decade before retiring. He's the weakest actor in this cast for sure. Vets Huston and Mitchell seem to be propping him up in every scene he has with them. It's really hard to dislike any movie with cinematography by the great Gregg Toland. His work is probably the best thing about this. Well, that and Russell's bosom. It's a slow and talky movie, which is made all the worse by the film's length and the bad dialogue. The script is terrible but there are some pretty unintentionally funny exchanges between the characters. Try not to laugh during a certain character's funeral scene. Also this movie features some of the worst misuse of music I've ever had the misfortune of experiencing. The music is obtrusive and seems to punctuate every scene, whether it's an action scene or comedy or romantic or whatever -- it just never stops! So do I recommend it? Well, obviously it's a must-see if you're a fan of Russell, Huston, or the two Howards. I suppose any good film buff should also see it for the history behind it as well as the talent involved. But no I wouldn't recommend it to any casual viewer just interested in seeing an entertaining movie. Judged objectively this is pretty bad. But there is worth in it for certain viewers, like myself, who are a fan of older films...and also a fan of bazoombas.

Very good looking and with charisma it is a mystery to me why his career didn't flourish. Walter Houston was admirable and we could feel his emotions easily..that is the result of a great actor. Thomas Mitchell equal to himself...never does a bad performance. The story line is simple but yet we are tempted to watch the film because of its fast pacing.

Unable to find such work, he was employed as an insurance clerk when he was noticed by an agent who was impressed by his looks.Introduced to Howard Hughes, who was about to begin filming The Outlaw, Buetel was signed to play the lead role as Billy the Kid, with the previously signed David Bacon being dropped from the film. Hughes also signed another newcomer, Jane Russell, for the female lead, and realizing the inexperience of his two stars, also signed veteran actors Thomas Mitchell and Walter Huston.Buetel was signed to a standard seven-year contract at $150 per week and was assured by Hughes that he would become a major star. Filmed in late 1940 and early 1941, The Outlaw officially premiered in 1943 but was not widely seen until 1946. It was notable for suggesting the act of sexual intercourse, uncommon in mainstream movies of the era, and for allowing characters to sin on film, without a suitable punishment also being depicted, in violation of the Production Code. Much of the publicity surrounding the release of the film focused on Jane Russell, and she established a solid film career, despite critics giving her performance in The Outlaw poor reviews.Buetel's performance was also highly criticised, and he languished with Hughes refusing to allow him to work. The director Howard Hawks tried to secure his services for the film Red River (1948), but after Hughes refused to allow Buetel to take part, Montgomery Clift was chosen and Clift went on to an active film career.In 1951 Buetel appeared in Best of the Badmen, his first film appearance in eleven years. Over the next few years he appeared in five more films, and made infrequent appearances on television. In 1956, he landed the role of 41-year-old Jeff Taggert in Edgar Buchanan's syndication western series, Judge Roy Bean. Others who appeared regularly in the 39-episode series, set in Langtry, Texas, were Jackie Loughery, X Brands, Tristram Coffin, Glenn Strange, and Lash La Rue. Buetel's last acting role was in a 1961 episode of Wagon Train. He also appeared as himself in the 1982 Night of 100 Stars television special.He died in Portland, Oregon, and was buried at Portland Memorial Park.The first time I saw this movie was in 1950 in a local cinema in Barcelona,(‚Äã‚Äãdouble session). in those days was something daring for a film the scenes between Jack Russell and Jean Beutel, although personally I was impressed mainly by the beauty of Jane Russell. I love the way the plot of the film, especially by the end of the story, unlike some other versions as to the truth of whether it was who killed Pat Garrett Billy the Kid. I prefer this ending for me was a surprise. It was a pity that Howard Hughes thus ruin the career of a good actor like Jack Beutel, but it also happened with other very good players, which ended up being ignored and forgotten. back to the movie I liked a lot. photography is excellent, the normal dialogs, the correct interpretation, since the lack of a good director and best screenplay had yielded better results. definitely a good movie.

Basically it is the 19th Century in the town of Lincoln, New Mexico, newly appointed sheriff Pat Garrett (Thomas Mitchell) is pleased to see his old friend Doc Holliday (Walter Huston). Soon after Billy the Kid (Jack Buetel) shows up as well, at first him and Doc have an instant rivalry, but in a weird turnaround they become good friends, this of course causes a bad reaction for Pat. Billy gets shot and wounded by Pat, so Doc hides him in the house of his girlfriend Rio McDonald (introducing Gentlemen Prefer Blondes' Jane Russell) to take care of him, and in doing so she starts falling for Billy. It is an obvious relationship as Billy treats Rio like dirt, but she is willing to join him, Doc and Pat when they ride away somewhere, go against the Indians in a battle. After they arrive at whatever the location is, and for whatever reason, Doc does find out that Billy has been getting closer to his girlfriend, and there is a fight between them. In the end however Doc is killed, and Pat is tied up, seemingly not to get out, and when it looks like Billy the Kid will ride away without Rio, he does turn back and they ride away lovingly into the distance. Also starring Mimi Aguglia as Guadalupe. Huston makes a pretty good Holliday, Buetel is likable as the rough Kid, but of course the beautiful Russell steals the show as the dark haired vixen, discovered by director Hughes, it is a shame she didn't get more great roles in the future, but at least she remained a great sex symbol. As for the film itself, it is quite unconventional, there are some funny moments, the love scenes between Russell and Buetel are quite good, and the unusual music by Victor Young is interesting, it is an alright western.

Freely and Fancifully embellished story gives substantially high level of real emotion.","Date":"30 March 2009","Score":"2 out of 6 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Drama, Romance","Review":" WELL we must be out of line with most of the movie viewing public, but we found this to be a most memorable film; albeit a most unorthodox Western. The publicity generated six decades ago certainly seems to have finally dissipated to the degree that now allows for an evaluation of the Howard Hughes project; without getting hung up on the appearance and specially constructed shaping garment, allegedly designed by Hughes himself, to exhibit the most ample, hyped and stylish mammaries in film history.(Up to that point anyway!)WHATEVER Mr. Hughes' talents were, it was never suggested that his abilities as a Movie Director should be included in his resume. Perhaps we are not being truly fair in this evaluation; our assessment being warped by our looking through the prism of all the years of publicity (mostly unwanted) of Howard Hughes the Oilman, the Aviator, the Airline Mogul and Aircraft Designer as well as his well publicized affairs with so many women in Hollywood. Lastly, we are well indoctrinated with tales of Howard Hughes, the billionaire recluse, the employer of men of Mormon Faith, Hughes the weirdo. MAKING a valiant attempt to see his rather limited Directorial output through clear lenses and minus any of that negative prejudice, we see a much different picture. If one has trouble accomplishing this, the same objective can be achieved simply by pretending that his work is the product of another, lesser luminary in the field of film direction.THE total number of movies bearing the Hughes name in the Director's chair being precious few; it is not a long or difficult task to do your own Howard Hughes Festival or retrospective. The Hughes-directed titles are limited to three (3) measly films; but what a glorious troika they make. They are chronologically (and in order of their production*) the World War I aviation extravaganza, HELL'S ANGELS (Caddo Company/United Artists, 1930), the Al Capone-like SCARFACE (Caddo Company/United Artists, 1932); in which Mr. Hughes shares directorial credit with one Richard Rosson.AS for our honoree of the day, THE OUTLAW (Howard Hughes, 1943; Howard Hughes/United Artists, 1946;Howard Hughes/RKO Radio Pictures, 1949), we found it to a sort of atypical Western romp. Oddly enough and flying in the face of all we had heard and read, we enjoyed it and feel that the movie is certainly much better than expected.UNLIKE most Western Movies, OUTLAW is low on action with the Gunplay being held down to a minimum and the horse racing around the huge boulders of her Ray Corrigan's Ranch or the multitude of natural wonders in Monument Valley, in the Utah & Arizona Desert . Everything was done either in the Studio or on its back. THE STUDIO filming of the indoor scenes, and there seems to be many in comparison to the outdoor sequences, tight space even claustrophobic feelings are pervasive throughout; rendering it a virtual antithesis of the usual Western Saga as done by men such as John Ford. While this may well seem at first to run contrary to what one's concept of a Horse Opera should be, let's stop and reconsider for after all some of the very best and most renowned Oaters were considered offbeat and highly atypical of the Genre. Yet, titles such as HIGH NOON and SHANE are valued as true works of the Cinematic Art.THIS Studio Soundstage filming and minimally used shoot-em-ups and gallop-fests were certainly not due to Hughes' being tight fisted with the cold ca$h; for one glance at the cast will surely be highly influential in changing one's mind in that respect. Producer-Director Hughes certainly spared no expense in bringing the very top talent into the project.STARTING with the cast, we have newcomers Jack Buetel, as Billy the Kid, in the title role and (Woo, woo, woo, woo!) a youthful and unbelievably beautiful Jane Russell as Rio McDonald, kind of a shady lady (more implied than stated). The film's cast is graced with the presence of two of the fine and preeminent Actors of that or any other era. Walter Huston as Doc Holiday and Thomas Mitchell as Sheriff Pat Garrett both sparkle in their roles and have managed to carry along the considerable amount of dialogue that is presented in the screen play. There isn't even one Yup or Nope to be heard throughout.THE CAST is further complemented by the inclusion of such dependable supporting character actors such as Joe Sawyer, Emory Parnell, William Newell, Ethan Laidlaw, Julian Rivero and William Steele. Looking closely will reveal that young Dickie Jones and a youthful Ben Johnson making the most of some unbilled assignments.ONE THING that THE OUTLAW does accomplish with a suma cum laude grade on its report card is its depth of character development. Each part is fully explored and made into something much more than a caricature of what a Westerner should be. Howard goes to an extreme, with the story & screenplay done by Jules Furthman, Howard Hawks & Ben Hecht, and delivers people we truly care about.WE MUST CONFESS, both Schultz and I really liked it and must give it a **** Rating.NOTE * We know that we were being redundant with that chronologically and in order of their production business. This was just an attempt on our part to be a little funny; besides, it was our only chance to have a footnote for this piece; which has become our trademark. Isn't that right, Schultz?

As one authority put it, her bosom spreads out over the picture like a thunderstorm over a landscape. And here, in excelsis, is male bonding in its most flagrant form. The camera dwells on Jack Beutel's soulful face as he lies back on the bed and while Tchaikovsky's love music swells in the background. This could easily be turned into a gay movie. All you would need is a good pair of garters. Hawks was to rip off his own earlobe-shooting bit in his later Red River.

It is amazing to see on the present days how a simple d√©collet√© could provoke such a reaction in 1943. Further, presently The Outlaw is a very silly western, showing a naive version of the legend of Billy the Kid. The repetitive soundtrack along many dialogs is very boring, and in the presents days this movie could be a parody of westerns movies. It is worthwhile as an entertainment and to satisfy the curiosity rose in The Aviator about this polemic work of Howard Hughes.

It lacks the fast pace and action packed, horse-chasing, bullet-riddled scenes that encompass most westerns of the time. Most of the cliches, both in dialogue and scene, aren't apparent. And most of all it examines the interplay between characters, each character had character...no one-dimensional cowboys and outlaws here.The dialogue is clever and often witty, the plot isn't predictable or full of holes, and most of all there isn't a proud, evil-fighting cowboy hero. In fact, the world is all grey, no black and white. The only other Western I can think of off the top of my head that paints a picture like that is High Noon (another absolute classic).Walter Huston (Doc Holliday) does carry this film, however. He's the strongest actor, and the real standout. Jack Buetel (Billy the Kid) is too cheezy and innocent for my liking...he's the only real cliche in the film, and it's just his lack of talent that causes it. Jane Russell is simmering, but she look sour most of the time, which is a bit much. If she smiled just once in a while it would really add a bit more character to her...Rio didn't seem like a character that sulked too much.Overall a great watch, with a lot more to offer than the average western. It's not steamy or graphic, think 40s censorship and not present day;) but Jane Russell is a sultry one. It's not the greatest film, far from it, but some of the camerawork is brilliant (and obviously influenced by the arrival of film noir). Definitely worth seeing, 7/10.

'Buy War Bonds' trailer); the VHS run time may be identical?.There is no pornography or profanity in this movie; which is suitable for all ages, according to parental guidance. This Classic film is superb a 9-star Western. The character acting by Walter Huston, Thomas Mitchell, Jane Russell, and Jack Buetel may never have been equalled in any of their other endeavours, except perhaps Mr Huston (the 'Missionary's puritanical wife' being chillingly played by the indefatigable Beulah Bondi) in 1932's RAIN, with Joan Crawford in one of the best of debutsic? performances. Mr Hughes made this unusually striking production as a passionate 'labour of love', for which it is not cliched either, to say that THE OUTLAW is a Western aficcionado's Western -- and controversally so. Introduced with a lavish publicity campaign, including wild west riders galloping through towns firing pistol blanks and capturing the Theatre on openings, tantalising pre-release trailers, and sexually emphasised posters of debuting Jane Russel. The film was opened to rave reviews, one of which, written on 13 February 1943, is to be found in BOX OFFICE MAGAZINE Online.This film is best seen for the extremely complex interplay of characters, ambience, ambivalent inter-personal relationships, and facinatingly incongruous situational vignettes, a melange of which is knitted together into a most satisfingly comprehensive whole, the which seems to encompass a sort of 'deutero-chronology'. The plot of this film cannot be told, for to do so for any part would be unacceptable to the masterpiece of the whole -- which, like a fine wine, is better understood and appreciated over time, in this case after several screenings. A genius made this picture and if there are cliches in this summary, they might well have been born from this film. The story involves the relationship among long-time friends Doc Holiday and Sheriff Pat Garrett, Billy, and Doc's lady, Rio; which compellingly developes with the lightheartedness of an hillside creek, the quietly deep flow of a mighty Mississippi River, and the sheer force of an intrepid Yukon!This Film is an extremely and subtly complex product of the synergistic genius of all concerned, under the masterful nexus of one of the great men of our century -- the founder of the aerospace giant Hughs Aircraft Company, of California, built with dominating drive and intelligence -- whose own life may have been so absorbed into the 'life' of this picture, that perhaps he never came back to himself until his own Conclusion, as the billionaire recluse, passed away under strange circumstances in 1976, surrounded by his Mormon aides. Hughes' passion for film making led him to make six pictures, including HELL'S ANGELS (1930) and SCARFACE (1932); and culminating with THE OUTLAW in 1938, an excptionally pivotal year -- the final watershed of an era which saw the old West become civilised, but before it had been forgotten in real-life experience and its denizens all passed away. Respect for history makes this film a necessity for everyone concerned about the American 'wild west', of its heyday, 1865-1905, but continuing in degrees nearly to the break of WWII. The film is composed of a myriad of vignettes, each of which can stand on its own as self-complete one of the reasons for the overall complexity, which is also the result of sheer cinematographical genius and geniuine 'charactor acting', the like of which is all too seldom seen today. This picture is a Classic, of far greater worth than is generally recognised.

Not only did this film offend so many historical facts about 19th century south- west, it portrayed a homo-erotic trio between Billy the Kid, Doc Holliday (Walter Huston) and Pat Garrett (Thomas Mitchell) that was reduced to the worst kind of camp comedy utterly boring.I won't waste your time by commenting on the plot, except to say it was simply ridiculous. (For a brief few seconds, I considered the possibility that Hughes had produced a clever satire, like 1974's Blazing Saddles. Forgetaboutit!) On the other hand, the final confrontation between Garrett and Holliday is so unintentionally funny I was rolling in my seat, holding my ribs. That was the high point in this movie for me. The rest of it is snore city.To be kind, the acting was just adequate for a high school stage play. The direction by Hughes proved he knew more about playing with aircraft than crafting plays. The editing must have been done by a blind six-year old; one scene, for example, ended on a door - for over twenty seconds! The musical score, by Tchaikovsky, was too intrusive, too loud and inappropriate for most of the scenes.Of course, as many know, this movie was made to showcase Jane Russell in her first role and, incidentally, to introduce Jack Buetel in his first movie also. Only the addition of the two stalwarts, Huston and Mitchell, allowed this effort to provide the necessary comic relief - such as it was. Those two must have been paid an awful lot of dough to appear in this turkey.Added all up, though, this movie could easily be labeled as the worst western in movie history (though that accolade, IMHO, still remains with 1969's Mackenna's Gold). However, as it is billed as 'comedy' first, I guess it wins the honor of being the worst comedy I've ever seen.

No need to belabor the limp pacing, the horrible scoring, the meandering script, or the inept Beutel.

Back when The Outlaw was completed, the film sat on the shelf for two years because it was considered unacceptable for the public. The Production Code was pretty much ignored and theater after theater either refused to show it or the local legal authorities threatened to jail the owners of the theaters. What was so indecent about this film? Apparently Jane Russell's breasts--and the many cleavage shots you see of her. However, you never see her breasts and by today's standards, it's actually a pretty tame film. Unfortunately, all this controversy made this film famous. I say unfortunately because after finally getting around to seeing it, it's a terrible movie! It seems that although the producer, Howard Hughes, took TONS of efforts to film the breast just right, no effort was made to get a script worth filming. The dialog is terrible, the film amazingly talky (VERY VERY VERY talky) and dull and historically speaking, it's even worse than the usual western about the semi-mythical heroes of the west.Speaking of getting the history wrong, there is no concrete evidence that Billy the Kid (a rather minor outlaw, by the way) knew or met Doc Holliday. But, what we DO know is that Holliday was NOT killed by Pat Garrett like he was in this film. He died in a sanitarium in Colorado of Tuberculosis!! In fact, most of the film is just made up junk--much of which was deliberately peppered with sexual innuendo. In one scene, it appears as if Billy the Kid rapes a lady (Russell) and she later falls in love with him (a VILE clich√© to say the least)! There are also scenes between them where she needs to cut off his clothes to save his life and it's STRONGLY implied she got naked with him to keep him warm! Pretty spicy stuff for 1941 (when the film was completed) but the rest of the film is so dumb and flat that the ONLY thing of interest is all the innuendo!I will point out that the acting was generally pretty bad. Walter Huston was such a good actor that in spite of everything, his scenes were decent. As for newcomers Jack Buetel and Jane Russell, they were simply awful--and the director did nothing to pull convincing performances from them. But the worst actor in this one was Thomas Mitchell, as he was a very experienced actor and STILL did a bunch of crappy scenes (especially near the end). Overall, there's NOTHING to like about this film aside from Russell's pulchritude.By the way, didn't anyone think to tell Russell that she kept BADLY mispronouncing 'Guadalupe' throughout the film--even though the lady was supposed to be her aunt?Also, if you go to New Mexico, you can visit Billy's graves. Yes, I say graveS because there's one near the roadway that is for tourists and the REAL one nearby. And yes, in real life Pat Garrett DEFINITELY killed Billy in the end--but not in this dopey film.

He does a great Billy the Kid, never overplaying what was obviously a sociopathic personality, as the script subtly shows. A good looker, he was also quite capable at letting various emotions play over his fact, as he fluctuates from innocence to suspicion to hostility to dire illness.The interplay between Garrett and Huston (Doc Masterson)  features the theme of friendship betrayed.  And forgive me the politically sensitive observation that the homoerotic attraction between the two was practically spelled out.  This guy has come between us  is a refrain Pat continually harps on.  As Masterson picks off his pursuers, he deliberately passes over Garrett..... a point Billy picks up on.Used to seeing Huston as an old man, as well as his son, I was quite pleased to watch the sparkling eyes, the wry expressions on his face and his skill at blocking the attempts by the 'good guys' to take Billy.Try seeing the Gore Vidal Billy the Kid in sequence with this one....should be a fascinating contrast.  What was funny AND realistic is the fact that many outlaws also were 'lawmen' as well.  The same traits were present in both, which Sociology tells us is still true....same socio-economic background, same attraction to violence, same loner tendencies.  The business with the Masterson guns as gifts from Garrett to Billy illustrate beautifully the trust among thieves.As for Jane Russell, her acting naivete shows in this one. As a 'protege' of Hughes, one wonders how much coaching she got from him.   In fact she talks in the same tone my 8 year old grand-daughter uses.  Since they were definitely selling sex in this show, I'm surprised we didn't get the full frontage view in her 'wet T-shirt' scene...but it was handled quite naturally, as she is dragged out of the pool. The men outact her, except for the Marilyn Monroe kissy-face she does to the camera when she falls for Billy.Since we don't know all the facts about Masterson, Garrett, and Billy (except that he was from New Jersey), this version is as good as another at telling us the truth.  Ive only seen it once, but intend to take the advice handed out to see it several times.  Like good literature, I should get something different from it each time.

Howard Hughes was linked to her romantically and all kinds of stories were written, however, it became a great CLASSIC and will go on for Generations after Generations. I thought the film was very funny and kept me laughing through most of the scenes. Jack Buetel,(Billy the Kid),Mustang,'59 was a baby faced criminal who wanted the horse that belonged to Walter Houston,(Doc Holliday),Dragon Seed,'44, who gave an outstanding performance through out the entire picture. Thomas Mitchell,(Pat Garrett),While the City Sleeps,'56, was a sheriff who tried to get along with everybody and tried to keep Billy the Kid and Doc Holliday from killing each other. Jane Russell,(Rio),Waco,66 was definitely the Star of the film and advanced to a great career on the Silver Screen. This is truly a great CLASSIC FILM! ENJOY. "}{"Title":"You call this controversial???","Date":"9 June 2005","Score":"2 out of 9 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Drama, Romance","Review":" Altogether, this was a pretty good flick; the cast was great, despite some acting flaws; the sets were OK, but in need of more detail; the story is solid, though it drags at times. The one thing that irks me is the fact that the MPAA and other censors over the years makes claims about certain pictures being indecent, vulgar, distasteful, etc.X100. What makes THIS so controversial? One scene; in which Jack Beutel and Jane Russell go at it....off-camera. How about before that, when Jane/Rio, in an effort to calm Billy's nerves, takes off her bra...off-camera??? Nowadays the earlier Disney, WB, MGM, and Universal shorts can't released on DVD or be shown on TV because of black-face gags, so called sexual innuendo, violence(???). This world has enough problems with it as it is. Whatever appears in movies appears in movies! That's just how it is. Everyone should just do themselves a favor, and just sit back, relax, and enjoy the show. Because after all, isn't that what this medium was for in the first place???

I can't believe you can dismiss this film so easily, it's one of the great westerns, with strong performances from the photogenic leads, a lot of atmosphere and a great score (Tchiakovsky's 'Symphonie Pathetique'), I can never understand why this film is not ranked up there with 'Once Upon a Time in the West', 'The Searchers' and 'Shane'.
