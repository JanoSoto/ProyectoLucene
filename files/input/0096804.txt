There's no super ninja for the lead hero to fight at the climax, which brings the climax down a bit from the first two, but hey, I applaud them for doing something different with this sequel to try & make it stand out. Worth a look for fans of low budget action movies & the first two films in the series.

Perhaps it failed because it dared to carry the American Ninja name instead of trying to be a stand alone film. Then again maybe people only watched it because of the name!In any case, American Ninja 3 is my favourite of the series, mainly because it drops the military fetish of the previous films in favour of pure martial arts action. The acting is neither above nor below the first two films and shouldn't be a factor in this genre anyway. Where American Ninja 3 excels is the action. The fight scenes are so much better choreographed than the clumsy action of the first two films. David Bradley is obviously a real martial artist and this casting makes a tremendous difference to the choreography. Gone are the simple throws and tight camera work tailored to mask Dudikoff's lack of martial skill and now we have lots of fast wide angle fights with flashy kicks and some meaty sound effects. The 80's style and fashions of the film only help to make me smile and of course the fantastic Steve James (the real star of the show) makes a welcome return.I guess it's all down to taste. I was brought up on Eastern Martial arts films with fine choreography from an early ages so when the American market started their attempts in the 80's the fights just weren't up to scratch for me and the first two films were a disappointment in that area as well as being more A-Team than Ninja. American Ninja 3 addresses these points and gets the focus of the film (the fights) right and that's all anyone can ask for in this genre, because if you are looking for moving acting or tremendous plots you are looking in the wrong genre.Not a patch on Hong Kong films but s solid martial arts film in it's own right!

The acting in this third installment to the American Ninja series was up to par with the previous movies, adequate but not particularly memorable.As with the previous movies, you know exactly how the movie will unfold, as they used the same recipe three times by now.And to top the icing on the cake, American Ninja 3 Blood Hunt had an overly annoying piano score playing throughout a large part of the movie. I am sure it was intended to compliment the movie, but it just added a level of idiotic spoof to the atmosphere of the movie.And it was especially entertaining to see Sean throw to arrows, yes throw, and killing two ninjas with them.Despite lacking originality and the original American Ninja star then this third movie is adequate, albeit slightly less mediocre, in entertainment value.

He gets sidetracked by his master (Izumo) being kidnapped. He elects the help of friends, Curtis Jackson (Steve James) & Dexter (Evan J. Klisser) and a secret source to get to the bottom of it. What Sean doesn't realize is that a ruthless individual known as The Cobra is concocting a deadly virus to experiment on peopleThis bears no resemblance to the first two movies, nor is it related. The only reference we get to the first two movies is when Jackson mentions leaving Joe Armstrong (Dudikoff) in the army. Let me get this out of the way. This doesn't resemble anything close to a quality film. It's poorly acted, the plot is ludicrous, and it is badly made. But if I said I didn't have any fun while watching it, I'd be lying. There are plenty of fights to keep things lively, and lots of cheese for bad movie lovers. Those that are complaining about how awful this movie, should watch American Ninja IV & American Ninja V. It'll make you appreciate this movie ever so slightly. I have a soft spot for the now defunct Cannon films production. It introduced me to one of the greatest martial arts movie ever made, Bloodsport. I can't really explain it, but I enjoy how cheesy Cannon movies are, and this movie falls into that category somewhat. I was really impressed by some of the cinematography. Some shots are rather breathtaking if you give yourself a chance to look around. The acting is where we really run into problems. David Bradley has some natural charisma, but you wouldn't know it by watching this movie. He looks uncomfortable at times, and is as wooden as can be. Michael Dudikoff was no great shakes himself, but at least he commanded your attention at times. Bradley is very skilled when it comes to martial arts, not so much acting wise. I found his recovery from the virus by using the ways of the ninja to be extremely far fetched. Steve James is absolutely awesome. Like the first two movies. He outshines the lead in a huge way, and steals every scene he's in with his charisma. The man is obviously a skilled martial artist as well. He is so underrated. Evan J. Klisser plays the comedic relief. He's amusing in small doses, highly annoying in others. Marjoe Gotner is very bland as the Cobra He tries to be all sinister, but he failed miserably. Michelle B. Chan is wooden as Chan Lee, but fun to watch in the action scenes. What was up with the ending? It's one of the most anti-climatic things i've ever seen in my life. There is no real ending, no gratification. I don't really know what they were going for, but it stunk. I couldn't finish this review without mentioning the very good end credits song. Whether you enjoy the movie or not, stick around to listen to Cobra Strikes by George S. Clinton. You won't regret itFinal Thoughts This is a pretty crappy movie. I consider It to be fun cheese in a lowbrow way at times. I wouldn't go out of my way to recommend it. It's pretty bad, but it can be fun at times if you ignore all of the faults.

When his master is kidnapped, he travels to a remote Caribbean island to try to find him. It even may have been perpetrated by baddies he remembers from his childhood. Along the way, he teams up with Curtis Jackson (James, reprising his role from the first two films) and Dexter (Klisser), the classic annoying character of the 80's. Because a sinister baddie known as The Cobra (Gortner) is manufacturing a germ that would wipe out mankind, our trio of heroes must stop him, and his goons. For no explained reason, his goons are ninjas in blue outfits. Eventually a female ninja, or, ninjette as Jackson calls her, Chan Lee (Chan) joins their ranks. Will they be able to stop the Cobra? The main problem with American Ninja 3 is that there are a bunch of little moments that are cool, but the movie as a whole is weak. For every underwater ninja fight and cool technique, there's a ton of material that's just very, very dumb. We realize you don't go into a movie like this expecting too much intelligence, but come on. This is one of those I'm losing brain cells movies. David Bradley doesn't really help the situation. It's hard to replace Dudikoff, but Bradley has no screen presence or personality. Dudikoff's hair engages you more than Bradley's performance.But the real insult is that they didn't make Steve James the new American Ninja. James, having put in his time in the first two installments, should have risen to the rank of American Ninja. Plus he's a better actor than Bradley and much, much more likable. Plus, he wears a sleeveless shirt that says Shalom, Y'all (when he's not shirtless or wearing a leather vest with no shirt). Also, they call him Powerhouse Jackson. Powerhouse should have gotten his own movie. Maybe he could find his long lost brother Action.It seems Cannon recycles plots fairly often and the plot here might seem very familiar. Perhaps a cross between American Ninja 2 and American Samurai. But at the risk of seeming ridiculous, the ninjas here seem tacked on. The Cobra's goons don't have to be ninjas, and it's never explained why they are. It's funny that The Cobra works at what you might call Terrorist Labs, Inc. where he works to develop the technology of terrorism, but why ninjas have to be dragged into this seems like a clear attempt to keep the 80's Ninja Boom going. But by '89 it seems to have been on the wane. So that might explain why we see things like a ninja just sitting in the passenger seat of a car. It just seems so pedestrian. A few short years earlier this same passenger ninja might be disappearing in a puff of smoke or climbing quickly up a tree (which are the main modes of transportation for ninjas, not cars).As sometimes happens, the end credits song is the best part of the movie. The Cobra Strikes by George S. Clinton and Lisa Kauppi is great, not to mention very catchy. It was a shame they didn't use it in the movie, such as during a montage.

Upon examining the finished product (and remembering the details from the previous movies), it seems that part 3 *was* originally written for Dudikoff's return. Sure, the movie showcases Bradley's character, but as you are watching the movie, you can mentally do some minor rewrites in your mind and see Dudikoff in the role. The fact that there are a number of scenes that do absolutely nothing to advance the plot, as well as a third-wheel character who proves to be absolutely unnecessary, just further the suspicion that the movie was hastily reconstructed upon Dudikoff's exit.Whether or not the movie was rewritten or not, the end results are pretty poor. Once again, Steve James proves the better actor (and martial artist), though this time around he barely gets a chance to show both of those talents. Bradley proves to be even more underwhelming than Dudikoff, if you can imagine that. The low budget is starting to become pretty evident, and the whole enterprise is poorly directed. Not just with the fight scenes being remarkably unexciting, but even simple scenes of dialogue are at times done with incredible incompetence. The story itself is pretty garbled at times - that is, when it *bothers* to try telling a story. But what do you expect from notorious schlock producer Harry Alan Towers?

The ninjas are merely wimps in costumes(even Dex is able to beat the crap out of them). The fight choreography is not very good as ninjas pop out for certain beat-downs. The good guys seem to rarely suffer the effects of blows to the face, but the ninjas drop pretty quickly. It's fun seeing James kicking ass, but even that can not save a dire, lame plot. The sequence towards the end where Sean tries to battle the virus within him through meditation is a howler. Even worse is Marjoe as Cobra who seems to have peed in his pants at the end as he tries to fight Bradley. The film ultimately is about watching Bradley and company mowing down men dressed up because real ninja would have finished them off rather quickly. Still, Bradley at least has a physical presence and seems to do most of his own martial arts work which helps at least add a hint of realism to his part, but watching these ninjas come out of the woodwork only to be thrown around and their limbs snapped with ease doesn't help the film any.

This helps a lot in the action scenes, where Bradley shines and gives us a good show. He is also a better actor at least at the time even if he was still incredibly bad. Unfortunately he lacked the original american ninja's charisma. The movie suffers with that. Gary Conway who stared as The Lion on the 2nd part also writing it is again responsible for the script and the story is quite close the previous movie. Although stories don't really matter in these movies, I still got the feeling I was watching a worse remake of a bad film. Even the score is the same.  There's also not a real opponent to Sean so the final fight is against Cobra, and as could be imagined, it's a terrible scene. Quite simply the movie doesn't have a climax. There are a lot of action sequences, some very well made but Michele Chan is a failure, with no beauty, no acting skills and no martial arts ability. And since Bradley couldn't be in every scene its up to Steve James to again steal the show with his power and talent. Funny, cool, Steve James was the man. But the truth is Blood Hunt is a bad, almost boring film. It didn't catch my interest and I found it hard to keep watching it until the end.Not much fun im afraid. If not for the great Steve James it would have been a complete loss. Too bad.

Through learning the ways of the ninja he uses it to make the inside cover of karate and compete in championships. However the tournament is a cover for The cobra to find the strongest man to use his virus on. Suffice to say our new hero ninja is the man. David Bradley took over for Michael Dudikoff for reasons unknown, however American Ninja 3 is a lifeless bore which features a hero so blank that it's almost quite humorous. If it wasn't so boring. Bradley really registers utterly zero rapport with the audience and it's really only Steve James and the campy antics of televangelist turned actor Marjoe Gortner. Also a big let down was that Dudikoff actually fought a ninja master but here Bradley's one on one is with Marjoe Gortner. Talk about a cheat. The action sequences are badly staged and it's fairly easy to see why people noticed Dudikoff's absence.* out of 4-(Bad) "},{"Title":"Is this a freaking joke","Date":"10 April 2006","Score":"2 out of 6 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Drama","Review":" Never in my life have I just for one second think, seeing such crap is possible.

Since this is IMDb, I guess story structure, believability, continuity, production values and special effects are paramount. In each of these areas, American Ninja 3Blood Hunt, fails. Speaking of Blood Hunt, let's start there.The title of a movie generally focuses on some aspect of the film. While the Ninja is American, I saw no Hunts that were bloody and no blood that was hunted. I guess the title was suppose to make me go...ooooo, a Blood Hunt! I gotta see this.Here's the idea. The American Ninja comes into town and wins some contest for world class ninjas. Then, in broad daylight, someone is kidnapped by fully clothed ninjas in front of at least a few dozen people. From about two blocks away, The American Ninja sees it and decides to chase them.The ninjas scamper, still in full ninja attire, across an open field. Then there's the fighting. (I can't actually find the right words to describe the fight scenes. I think I'll just call it The Bad) The biggest flaws of the movie, if you can call it a movie, are the ending and special effects. The whole movie, our protagonist, THE American NINJA, is looking for his missing sensei. THE American NINJA discovers that he's probably hidden in some factory. He gets in, kicks everyone's tail and then leaves the place...Did anyone catch that...no one...The plot is completely dropped in the final climax. No one even cares about the sensei. Not to mention after murdering about 2 dozen people, he doesn't even kill the archvillian, just kicks him in the chest. That's it.During his little rampage at the factory, he gets an arrow shot at him, catches it and throws it back at the guy who shot it, killing him instantly.Did anyone catch that...no one...That's what this movie is about. Laughing at it is actually worth seeing it. If you have 80 minutes to kill and this is on, it's worth the laugh. You'll love American ninja in the same way you love a cheesy horror movie. Ninjas running through crowded streets, terrible stunts, even worse acting and an even more miserable plot, this movie fails so terribly on every level, it's difficult not to look at it like the small kid who gets picked last in Kickball. You can't help but think how cute, they tried to make a movie. Better luck next time.

So at 3 in the morning this movie comes on on channel 5, of all channels. I thought I'd be in for a treat (name recognition), but no, this movie really sucked.Yes, this movie uses elements that other movies of this type do... just not very well at all. One element... This movie shows Sean (a boy, then) watch his father get killed in the very beginning of the movie. But no real emotion there. It was a very quick, abrupt scene. But in the next scene he is still a boy, training in some jungle, with a smile on his face! Then it never mentions the loss of his father until the end of the movie, where he is emotionally charged by a flashback of that first scene, which was an even quicker take! UGH. So that whole retribution / power thing was screwed in this movie. Another element is that of a warrior reaching ultimate power after the mind being cleared. Every martial arts movie has this. Fist of the North star (animated) in the beginning, and most recently, the Matrix, at the very end. Those movies used that element WELL. This movie... well, I'll have to say, it was the best part of the film but it still sucked. He used this new power to kick a** but then, all the fight scenes in the movie were badly choreographed anyway. They are slow and weak.Do not watch this movie!

I've seen American Ninja 1, 2 and now 3 and each one is just so boring. I think the 3rd installment tops it off.No Dudikoff this time, maybe he's seen sense and got the hell out of the American Ninja movies before it completely wrecks his constant down hill career. Although Mr badass himself, Steve James (Jackson) returns, who looks so out of place. There's also a new guy in town, David Bradley, who in my opinion is just a beefier version of Dudikoff, but with less acting abilities and more facial expressions.As usual the countless number of ninja's if that's what you want to call them (I personally think they are the local thugs dressed in pj's) are back. These ninja are possibly the biggest pushovers in movie history, they can't fight for toffee. James and Bradley have to wade through them all, displaying awful choreographed fight scenes (which is the highlight of the movie, as it's so pathetically funny) and kill the usual bad guy...whose also a pushover.American Ninja is bad, I mean really bad.

Absolutely the pits. If a picture says more than a thousand words, then writing abysmal 133,500,000 times should begin to touch the level that this movie is on. Brain death is a good place to start if you want to enjoy this pathetic dribble.Stunts that would embarrass Matlock and a script that could frighten the writers of the Menthos commercials.Apart from such elements as secret island ninja cults, the obligatory karate championship and the evil European-accent criminal mastermind, this manages to scrape the bottom of a barrel to a degree that even the original movie could not touch when it introduces such wonderfully realistic elements as genetically modified superninjas as a tool to terrorist generals and - here is something new and original - oil sheik arabs driving Mercedeses.There is also a female ninja master who sees the light and is turned over to the good side and is wooed by the American ninja, as well as a comic relief sidekick, both of whom - and this is the only redeeming feature of the movie - die.Apart from this, ninjas that are clearly made from alabaster, judging by how easy they snuff it, fighting sequences that lack any sort of power or punch (the female ninja is absolutely pathetic) and a piano riff that plays through every damn single fighting sequence to the point where you can feel it drilling through your ear drums.Oh, and the credits song.

I saw the first 2 films and compared to this one, 1 and 2 blow this movie out of the water.David Bradley looked really lost during this movie. Steven James did OK as Curtis Jackson but if you look very carfully he looked really reluctant to be in this movie and he looked very pale at times from his cancer. And what can you say about the ninjas. Geez. These guys have gotta be the stupid ninjas around. The ninjas in the first 2 films put up more of a fight. For example. In the scene where Bradley is watching the female fight the ninjas from the top of the building. And these guys just walked right into it. The women just lightly swung the sords and these guys went flying. I mean come on.And finally. I didn't like seeing a American movie with Michael Dudikoff. This guy was awesome in the first 2 films but he wss smart to turn down this movie. The Joe Armstrong character is more tougher and believable then Sean Davidson character played by Bradley.
