Scott loses his wife and daughter in a car accident, moves to Seattle, and rents a gigantic old mansion with a haunted secret past.  This film is skillfully directed by Peter Medak who gets more that even he probably bargained from a solid cast of actors, a wonderful script, and one great-looking eerie old house.  Medak creates tons of suspense with the barest sight of blood.  This film reeks atmosphere.  The house reeks atmosphere.  Scott's performance and that of veteran Melvyn Douglass reek atmosphere.  Doors creak, balls mysteriously bounce, water runs, windows break in the old house trying to tell Scott about the secret of a young child that once lived there.  The script is fanciful yet well-written and very creative.  Scott gives an atypically subdued performance that suggests passion, heartbreak, and tenacity.  The rest of the performers are very good too.  I cannot remember the last time Mr. Douglass gave a poor performance.  Some of the scenes that really stand out in my mind are flashback sequences showing the terrible secret that has been hidden in the house for over 70 years.  Medak doesn't have a huge budget to work with here, but this movie beats out newer haunted house films like the remake of The Haunting by leaps and bounds.  This is one classy scare film!

Scott) who, as the film opens, loses his wife and daughter in a tragic accident. Getting away from it all, Scott buys an old home to get his mind right and to get back to doing the work he loves. Soon he discovers that his house is haunted and filled with secrets waiting to be revealed. To say much more then that would be unfair to the first time viewer.Suffice to say this is a chilling film with several good scares that aren't achieved by manipulating the audience. By that I mean loud chords of music on the soundtrack or the unexpected cry of a cat or something like that. The Changeling works for its scares and succeeds. Another big reason the film is so well done is the performance by Scott. For a change the hero in a ghost story is not a wimp but a strong, self assured man who is going to fight to the bitter end to find the truth and get his life back. Very few actors could have pulled it off better then Scott.The supporting cast is headed by Melvyn Douglas (in one of his last roles) and Scott's wife, Trish Van Devere who projects a look of total terror as well as anyone I have seen.Two moments that stand out are the s√©ance scene which is eerie and the unexpected arrival of a child's toy ball. This film will give you shivers. If you are a fan check it out and make sure to watch it with a loved one cuddling up against you with all the lights turned out.

He rents an old and secluded mansion from the historical society as a place to live. Soon after he moves into the house, strange occurrences begin.This is one of those horror movies that can be scary without being bloody and gory. It simply relies on atmosphere and frightening, but subtle images to deliver its chills, and it works. I will never be able to understand that R rating mainly because there is only very mild profanity and there is no blood or gore.

Dark, spooky stairways draped with dusty cobwebs, a boarded up room with a terrible secret, a shadowy seance scene, ghostly voices and frightening noises that echo through the huge house, political intrigue and a very solid looking ghost who scares the absolute hell out of anyone he shows himself to. It boasts a well thought out plot with several great twists and a very angry murder victim, who doesn't want to be at peace - he just wants revenge, and boy does he get it. Fans of Ringu will enjoy this tale of murder, ghostly revenge and bodies thrown down wells. Just watch it, preferably on a dark and stormy night with all the lights turned off. I dare you.

A few of the reviews I see below seem to be written by those who have read glowing reviews but just didn't get it  Comparisons with 'The Exorcist', a story of demonic possession, are inappropriate. This movie isn't a visual shock feast nor a gore fest,  this is a powerful psychological drama. The penultimate ghost story. If you just sit back in a defensive posture and challenge the movie to scare you, you will lose out completely. If however you choose to get involved, you will find yourself going for one hell of a ride. Few scenes in moviedom rival the poignancy, for instance, of the disbelieving George C. Scott character when he is reviewing the tape of the seance and comes upon the inescapable evidence that there IS a paranormal presence in the house. Here I will make my own inappropriate comparison In the context of this story, Scotts ultimately human and believable response and the collapse that follows is far scarier than Exorcist's Reagan spewing green puke, by a long shot.  And the little girl going alone, summoned into the haunted room in her house at night? Forget about it. My hair stands on end.  If 'The Changeling', watched at night doesn't give you a fright, then there are at least six 'Hallowe'en' movies on the rack that should suit your particular needs.  The Changeling is something else the fear of the spiritually macabre.

They contain characters, situations, and elements you've seen before. The exceptions have been THE SIXTH SENSE and SCREAM. THE SIXTH SENSE cleverly turned the ghost genre on it's head and SCREAM mocked the slasher genre while still providing some good thrills. However, there is only one film when it comes to the haunted house genre.Peter Medak's THE CHANGELING is everything a horror film should be. It's suspenseful, well acted, contains an intelligent plot, and uses no special effects or gore to obtain it's objective. It generates real fear.George C. Scott plays John Russell. He's a man trying to endure the tragic loss of his wife and daughter. He rents a mysterious, old house from the Historical Society where he can compose out of. He's an accomplished piano player and takes a job teaching piano at a University. He's got quite the reputation as the size of the class is monstrous.Soon, things begin to get strange. Every morning there are loud, banging noises from upstairs in the house. These noises lead to a bedroom where a child's wheelchair is found and an old music box that plays an identical song to the one Russell's been composing. It gets even more terrifying from there as Russell investigates the history of the house with the help of Claire, a beautiful member of the Historical Society, played by Trish Van Devere. Scott and Van Devere have a natural chemistry and it may be due to the fact that they were really married.Russell finds out some surprising secrets after a terrifying Seance. The secrets lead him to Senator Joseph Carmichel, played by the great Melvyn Douglas. Carmichel tries to keep everything quiet but the dead have a way of tormenting the living and keeping old secrets alive.A great horror film can derive fear from even the simplest things. In this film a child's ball rolling down the stairs will make your hair stand up on end. There's also a piano striking a chord without a player, and a glass flying off a table and shattering during a Seance. This film is filled with those simple things and a whole lot more.Today's films are filled with quick cuts, computer generated effects, and loud scores. This film achieves it's objective in a much more subtle fashion. It's characters are real people and not just reactors. It's story is intelligent and well told. Finally, it's effect is chilling and stays with you long after the experience, the mark of a truly great horror film.

I love horror films but either there aren't that many about houses with personality or I have just been to Jasonized.  Either way, that is going to change for me. Because after experiencing how this movie made me feel, I am going to go out and rent as many of the classics about haunted houses as I can find.  The Changeling is everything that The Haunting (99) should have been.  This film creeps you out sometimes more than you can handle.  Where as the Haunting used 80 million dollars worth of special effects, The Changeling used lighting, sound, subtlety and an intriguing and scary story to achieve the ultimate in horror, scares, chills, shivers and your hair standing straight on the back of your neck.George C. Scott plays a man who has just recently lost his wife and young daughter to a freak accident on the highway in the dead of winter.  He leases a rather large house supposedly for some solitude so he can work on his musical piece.  But then strange things begin to happen.  At first he passes them off as just an old house having a personality of its own.  But then when the noise persist at the exact time of day and for the same amount of time, he gets suspicious.  After doing a little research, he realizes that not only is the house haunted, but it may be trying to tell him something.  And this is where the story becomes creepy.  I haven't really felt a sense of unease in many movies.  The Blair Witch was one of them, and The Changeling made me feel similar to that experience.  What this film does to perfection is uses what it has to its advantage.  There are lots of darkly lit rooms, strange noises that apparently come from the upstairs bedroom, and bouncing balls.  The Changeling is a scary movie and it would have been without the ball, but when you put the ball into the scenario, you are frozen with fear.  And for the first time in the film when the ball comes into frame, Scott looks petrified.  Before this incident, he seemed bewildered, almost curious.  He couldn't understand why all this was happening.  But after the ball, he is frightened.  Even if whatever it is that is haunting this house seems to be somewhat friendly towards him, he is still scared.I found myself yelling at the screen,  Get OUT!   I wanted them to leave the house.  That is how frightened I was for the characters in the film. And when a movie can do that to you, you have to admire it.  I loved The Changeling.  I love how it made me feel and I love how it altered my physical appearance ( hair standing straight on end ).  If you want to see a scary film that will restore your faith in horror movie, see this one. This is a perfect example of how horror films were so amazing in the 70's and 80's.  They are scary and pay attention to details.  I am not sure why films today can't do that, there are exceptions of course ( Blair Witch, Sixth Sense ) but mostly we get crap like Urban Legend and Idle Hands and whatever.  This film however knows the true roots of horror and it knows how to scare.  My recommendation is to watch this with all the lights off on a stormy night.  You will be afraid.  You will be.

It's a ghost story, about a crippled child who is murdered by his greedy father to replace him with a healthy boy. The ghost of this child roams in the attic of the old house where he was murdered. George C.Scott's character, a music teacher who has suffered the tragic loss of his family in a freak accident, rents the house and becomes aware that there's something wrong there. Again, you've probably heard this story line a dozen times before, but The Changeling is brilliantly executed and the performance of George C.Scott is, in my opinion, very down to earth and real. Someone in this section said that his performance was wooden (and gave Keanu Reeves as an example), but I beg to differ. He is an old man who, like many of us would, refuses the idea of having a ghost in his house. His acting was very realistic. Although the movie moves at a rather slow pace, it never ceases to be interesting. It's one of those movies that needs to be seen late at night, surrounded by darkness and put full attention to. I remember I was scared out of my pants when I saw it 20 years ago and I've recently purchased it and have seen it many times again, now with my wife, who also happens to love it. One thing I will never understand is the R rating this film got. There are no nude scenes, no graphic violence, virtually no blood...there's not one curse in the dialog! Anyway, it still is a very creepy movie and if you'd like to see a well done suspense story, don't hesitate in watching this one!

It stars George C. Scott, Trish Van Devere, Melvyn Douglas, John Colicos and Jean Marsh. Plot finds Scott as John Russell, a music composer whose life is shattered when an accident kills both his wife and young daughter. Relocating to Seattle, Russell rents a large Gothic style mansion from which to bury himself in his work. But he soon discovers he is not alone in the house, there is a ghost here and it desperately wants his help with something...Not a teenager or a scantily clad bad actress in sight here, for this is a traditional haunted house spooker for the adults, one that has a distressing mystery at its core that's just aching to be solved. Chief writer Russell Hunter has based much of the film on an incidents that happened to him in real life when he moved into a house in Denver. If you believe him or not is not really the point, because it does not take away from just how well executed The Changeling is, both as a scary movie and a well thought out drama. There's limited characters in the narrative, thus keeping the film free from filler and the clumsy character set-ups that mar so many horror films these days. It's also worth noting that it doesn't suffer from dating either, as Nicole Kidman starrer The Others proved 21 years later, a haunted house tale can be effective in any decade if the writing and direction is spot on. The Changeling has both, plus a towering and believable performance from Scott leading the way.Medak clearly knows that an imposing house is a key element. Utilising the big spaces to emphasise Russell's loneliness, he sweeps his camera around the sets (this is not a real house, it's a brilliant mock-up creation by the designers) to give the feeling of a spirit observing proceedings. The house is always a main character and acts as the perfect backdrop to some ghostly goings on (excellent work from the sound department too). The chills are genuine, the attic room is creepy personified, a rubber ball, a wheelchair, a bath sequence, an old water well and even the gentle tinkling from a music box, all induce the hairs on the back of the neck to stand to attention. And there's a s√©ance! Oh yes indeed, a s√©ance that's tape recorded, more chills down the spine on the way there as well. All played out to some lush unholy musical arrangements from Ken Wannberg (the music box theme composed by Howard Blake).Setting it apart from conventional haunted house movies is that it has a most intriguing story to tell. One of murder, greed, deception and grief. The latter part is often forgotten when talk of The Changeling arises. John Russell is absolutely stricken with grief, this stops him from being one of those characters who you shake your head at because they refuse to leave a clearly troubled house. His grief process, which makes him the ideal host for what this spirit wants, means he has no fear, some unhappy ghost can't hurt him anymore than he is hurting anyway. It's a neat and seamless meditation on grief that's threaded into the story. The last quarter of the film slips into action territory, which is a little jarring given the smooth pacing Medak has favoured up to that point. But although the scares have gone, the intelligent story has come full circle and the film closes down triumphantly without copping out or having resorted to unimaginative formula.An essential viewing for those who like haunted house movies; especially if you like slow build and genuine mystery as well. 9/10 "},{"Title":"This film is worth more credit that it's given (Revised)","Date":"7 December 2013","Score":"4 out of 5 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Fantasy, Horror","Review":" If you're looking for an honest, classy horror film with charm...then look no further than Peter Medak's The Changeling. And don't let its age fool you, it still holds up beautifully well in this day and age.The premise is fairly simple. George C. Scott plays a grieving composer who has just lost his family in a traffic accident. He moves into a large house to hopefully find some peace and quiet. But if we already know one thing, it's that we know he isn't alone in the house, or else we wouldn't have our story.Indeed, there is more than one occupant in that house. And they are not among the living. At first it's your typical haunted house fluff. Doors opening and closing, piano's playing by themselves, etc. But suddenly, it's not that simple anymore. The movie takes a very unexpected turn from horror drama, to murder mystery...and suddenly our hearts are beating as fast as the plot is thickening. The film does not let up until the very end. In short The Changeling does not disappoint. It is a film that has unfortunately slipped through the cracks of obscurity and into the shadows where only the most well informed horror movie buffs are able to find it. Which is truly undeserving considering it's production value and how well it's made. There are several scenes in the film that are enough to give one intense goosebumps. The Seance scene in one such example. It's unsettling and eerie. This, among other great scenes like it...is the foundation where upon the makings of a great horror film come from.The acting is great and completely authentic. The film features a great cast and solid performances from the immensely talented George. C Scott and his wife Trish Van Devere. Both actors are well fit in their roles and add a touch of originality and sincerity to their characters.The atmosphere is just incredible. It induces such spine tingling terror without showing hardly any gore or violence whatsoever. The Changeling relies on sound, tension and slow burning thrills to scare. And it does so very effectively. Also, don't be surprised if you suddenly acquire a phobia of wheelchairs after viewing this film. You will never look at them in the same way again. This Canadian horror film is worthy of just as much praise as classics such as The Shining or The Sixth Sense. Give it a chance and you'll be glad you did.

I grabbed a copy from a friend of mine who told me that it's kind of like The Sixth Sense, so I'm going into this movie thinking that the guy is dead the whole time. It plays out, for me at least, more like Stir Of Echoes. It's nice to see where those films grabbed their influences from.While the film plays out slowly and may turn some people off, I was surprisingly hooked from start to finish and was honestly nervous during certain scenes that were spooky as hell.Even after watching the recent Changeling from Eastwood, I still did not know what it meant, thank you George C Scott for clearing things up. Speaking of Scott, he does a great job here. for some strange reason, even though there is no real indication of this, I got the sense that this guy is a bad ass. Which could be the complete opposite of what they were going for, since he was suppose to be a tormented soul that connected with the dead.The camera movements in this film were probably the scariest thing about it. Certain scenes that play out as if they were P.O.V shots that seemed to float around the house, simply terrifying. Also, the house itself is scary.

I had no idea what to expect, i had just heard that it was a forgotten classic of the genre and it truly is an extremely creepy and unsettling horror. Unlike modern movies that rely on gore and cheap scares to entertain their audiences, the changeling showcases how an emphasis on psychological scares can be far more terrifying for the viewer.As well as being a disturbing horror, the changeling is a clever mystery film with George C.

Attempting to escape the trauma and leave the past behind him John moves into a new house but in doing so is confronted by a spirit that constantly plagues the house with strange disturbances. I do not want to reveal too much of the plot but it is a very intelligent movie, with a lot to offer for the avid horror fan.

You feel George C. Scott's devastation over and over again. His grief is so palpable that it seems this is the very reason that the spirit in the house connects with him. He is told by outsiders that the house doesn't want anyone to live there, but he alone is permitted to stay, and he is the one resident of this house that the spirit reaches out to because he is a man who would give anything in the world to have been able to save the ones he lost.This is a classic, and by far superior to many films in this genre.

Scott gave us many great performances over his brilliant career and this is yet another. Scott stars as John Russell, a middle aged music professor who witnesses the tragic accidental death of his wife and young daughter. Four months after this happens he decides to move to Seattle, Washington and teach college there. He looks for a house to rent and finds one with the help of a young, beautiful realtor named Claire Norman (his off-screen wife Trish Van Devere). It is a very large mansion with a unknown past and Russell is happy living there at first. But all is not well at Chessman Park. A malevolent spirit soon makes its presence known to John and it is not at rest. John believes it is trying to communicate with him due to his previous traumatic experience and he feels it wants him to figure something out most likely its own death. As Russell starts to dig deeper into the house's history and he slowly yet steadily begins to unravel an evil conspiracy which is as powerful as it is mysterious and threatens to destroy Russell and Claire before they can escape its deadly grasp. There are three or four scenes in particular that will shock and frighten you especially the bathroom scene and the attic scene. I would not recommend this for small children or sensitive adults. And I feel compelled to mention the stairway scene with the ball is a legend in horror films and was even parodied in Scary Movie 2 if anyone would like to know. The wheelchair scene is also horrifying and cleverly done. Certainly one of the most scary and haunting films you will ever see it makes my own top ten list of best horror films ever made.

Scott) takes residence in a brooding mansion haunted by the spirit of a little boy who was murdered for political reasons in the 1920's.Peter Medak's elegant chiller ranks alongside THE DEVIL AND DANIEL WEBSTER (1941) and PORTRAIT OF JENNIE (1948) as one of the most accomplished ghost stories ever filmed. Sidelined on its original release by a glut of low budget shockers dominating US theaters at the time, the movie has since been rediscovered on TV and home video, where viewers have responded with enthusiasm to its stylish visuals and classy production values.Like the mansion in which its horrors unfold, THE CHANGELING is a grand and stately affair which forsakes all-out supernatural mayhem for quiet, creepy details (a door creaking open of its own accord in broad daylight; a cluttered attic room festooned with cobwebs where a child's wheelchair betrays evidence of a guilty secret, etc.), culminating in one of the most frightening scenes of the entire movie, in which Scott replays an audio recording of an especially memorable seance and hears... well, let's just say, it'll keep some viewers awake long into the night! For maximum impact, try to hear it in the original Dolby sound configuration...Performances are top-drawer, including Melvyn Douglas as the ageing politician whose career was constructed on the foundations of murder, Trish Van Devere (Scott's wife at the time) as the real estate agent who becomes mixed-up in the inquiry, John Colicos as a cop who thinks Scott's investigation amounts to little more than an assault on Douglas' integrity, and Ruth Springford as an elderly patron of the local historical society who provides vital clues to the mansion's tragic history. Jean Marsh cameos as Scott's ill-fated wife. Hungarian-born director Medak - who began his career with a number of critically acclaimed black comedies like NEGATIVES (1968) and THE RULING CLASS (1972) - later distinguished himself with the intense true-crime dramas THE KRAYS (1990) and LET HIM HAVE IT (1991), before getting lost on the Hollywood treadmill.

I saw it again two years later and managed to watch it all the way through but it still remains the only film that has genuinely frightened me, and I've seen all the so-called scary films such as The Exorcist, The Omen, etc. I don't wish to say what happens in the film-as this would ruin the impact it will have when you first watch it-but I will talk a little about the plot. Musical composer John Russell (George C Scott)-after suffering the loss of his wife and daughter-moves into a mansion owned by a local historical society and soon realises that the house holds unpleasant secrets which Russell feels compelled to expose, and so begins a chain of horrific events which not only uncover the secrets of the house's past, but threaten the very reputations of Russell (for being considered insane by the police) and two other key characters, played by Trish Van Devere and Melvyn Douglas. Personally this has become my favourite film, and I feel it is also underrated as most people haven't even heard of it. Most horror films I know take a while for the 'frightening' scenes to happen, but The Changeling runs for only ten minutes before the ghostly occurrences begin. This film in my opinion is a lost classic, as it has everything a genuine horror film should have. Fightening scenes, brilliant acting and an excellent plot.

Good ghost stories should have a subtle sense of spookiness coupled with an intriguing and often puzzling mystery. Where this film fell short from my personal tastes is right in the ending scenes and ultimate climax. Without (I hope) putting any 'spoilers' in my comments here, the ending scenes and ultimate climax are typical of the trend of modern film makers feeling that they have to take every sensational film story and build it up to a tremendous climax such as in the film Poltergeist. As a person who is well read on ghost stories and also on real life accountings of the paranormal, I just do not feel that ghosts if they exist, especially ghosts or spirits of children have the kind of powers that were depicted in the ending of this film. I was dissapointed however I must say that the ending is typically good and in line with films made during this modern era.

The changeling, on the other hand is a magnum opus of the mysterious, macabre, and the eerie realm of the unknown. Each film a masterful achievement, however each of a very different type of horror film.The Changeling is a well crafted and enigmatical story of a man who moves into an old gothic house after the tragic loss of his family. He is then confronted by a haunting from a malevolent ghost of a murdered child.Atmospheric and chilling, this gem is best viewed when you're alone, when you're in the dark as the rain patters against your windows and the wind howls through the rafters, only then, while you are watching 'The Changeling', you must ask yourself, `are these ghostly sounds coming from my television, or the dark areas behind me?'

When it comes to sheer scares this ranks up there with such classics as The Exorcist, The Omen and Poltergeist.If you're anything like me, the first time I see a horror film - if I see it on the small screen - I have to see it alone. Having someone else in the same room takes away the 'edge' if you will. I just love the thrill of being scared silly and for me to get that sensation I can't have anyone holding my hand, or pulling me out of the movie with a disturbing cough or sigh. There are however times when I regret this self-induced terror, such as the time when I was 16 and rented Candyman and ended up turning the lights on (to this day I still can't look into a mirror and say his name five times), or when I finally saw Hideo Nakata's Ringu and actually started hyperventilating when you-know-who came crawling out of you-know-what.The Changeling is another one of these wonderful experiences of unspeakable horror when I found myself wanting to turn back the clock and wish I in stead was watching something a little more harmless, like The Amityville Horror. For years I've had fond memories of George C. Scott when it comes to scary movies, as he starred in The Exorcist III Legion, one of the most underrated horror films in modern history (that scene when the nurse gets it in that hospital corridor really sent my popcorn flying). And as always Scott is great in The Changeling and so is his real-life wife Trish Van Devere, Hollywood-legend Melvyn Douglas and the rest of the sturdy cast.But Scott really isn't the star here. What makes the show here is that house (which gets a 10 on the creepy-scale), that wheel-chair, that little red ball, that tape recorder, that seance and every thing else imaginable. You name every haunted house clich√© you can come up with and The Changeling has it, but it's the fact that it does it so much better than any other that makes the end result so memorable.It is also worth noticing that the movie includes a scene with a well that almost certainly must have inspired the Japanese (above mentioned) modern horror classic Ringu (1998). On top of that it depicts a harrowing murder scene with a child that left me quite disturbed and I thought I could stomach anything, so be warned...*BOOO!*Hehehe...

In fact, I would rank it in the top five haunted house films of all time. The large, old house, with its hidden attic, makes the perfect setting for this kind of movie. The backstory of the boy that died and the house's history are presented in a series of very spooky and effective flashbacks. Other moments that really stand out in my mind are the ball bouncing down the stairs on its own and the wheel chair chase scene. The ball bouncing scene, in particular, is one of those very subtle creepy moments that can make a movie like this.- The Changeling co-stars Melvyn Douglas in one of his last movie roles. It's a real treat to watch him at this point in his career. Back in 1932, he appeared in a one of my favorites - The Old Dark House.

This film can easy become one of those rare ones who really scares you. A few preparations need to made first, though. Watch this film late at night if possible. Don't turn on too many lights and make sure no other sounds then those coming from the movie can ruin the atmosphere. This really was one of the best stories I ever saw. It's a known film but not so much as the Amityville Horror, which was released around the same time. Well, in my humble opinion, The Changeling is much better. Much more intense to say the least. Director Peter Medak proved himself to be a great storyteller more than once already. I remember the Krays biography to be very good and Romeo is Bleeding too. The Changeling belongs to his earlier work but still is one of his best films. A respected musician, Russel, loses both his wife and daughter in a terrible road accident. Only 4 moths later, he accepts a new job at a university and he moves into a new and very large house. Right after Russel moves in, the house starts to act strange. Weird and disturbing noises wake him up in the morning and he discovers a secret attic, with a mysterious wheelchair and music box in it. Russel is intrigued by these objects and, seeing that the secret room belonged to a young child, he feels related because of what happened to his own daughter. He starts to dig deeper and more intense. To find out more about the whole case, he even holds a s√©ance to get in contact with the mysterious child. This particular scene is really breathtaking, I assure you. Actually, the whole evolution of the horrifying house is breathtaking. It really gives you the creeps. George C. Scott gives away an excellent performance. When he loses his family at the beginning of the movie, you can really feel his pain. George was one of the greatest actors who ever lived and he was able to carry a complete movie all by himself, like he did here. If you like his acting as well, you should really check out the Changeling.

As for the acting, I have no complaints. And if it wasn't for the decent acting, this movie would have sucked 10 times more than it already does.

Whether he was trying to get revenge by killing those involved in his murder, or trying to expose the reality about the murderer father and stain his name forever. It can't be the first one, or he would have easily killed the senator the same way he killed the dirty -or the misled- cop! And it can't also be the second, or he would have tortured the musician until he forces him to go to police/press with story and evidences! or at least if the guy fail him, he wouldn't have just burned the house (crime scene) burning all the evidences and ending his last hope that one day someone may help him expose the truth!Similar contradiction arises about whether the senator knew about the crime or not. If he didn't know, why pay the woman at the (whatever) to tip him that a man and a woman are researching the past owners of the house? So he knows, but then how come he died of shock when he saw what he already knew his -alleged- father did? I tried to excuse this contradiction by assuming that he knew that he was adopted and passed as the real son, but did not know that the father Killed the real son. But points like this shouldn't be left for assumptions, that's why it was another Down of the movie.Also, what is the significance of choosing a guy that has lost his daughter to help him? Wouldn't any one help exposing a murder unless he was a father who's lost a daughter? meaningless and unnecessary addition to an already weak story line.So, its good as a Friday night pastime, but if you are looking for masterpieces of cinematic craftsmanship, this won't be the answer for you.

I consider Mario Bava's Shock the high point of this subgenre, though Peter Medak's The Changeling comes awfully close in terms of suspense and atmosphere. George C. Scott plays John Russell, a NYC composer/pianist who loses his wife and daughter in a freak accident; decimated, he relocates to Seattle, quickly assuming a teaching position and living in a vacant mansion owned by the local historical society; not long after, Russell is awakened by an inexplicable loud banging, and uncovers a boarded up attic room that portends a revelation I won't give away. The film avoids convention very well (for example, the relationship between Russell and Realtor Trish Van Devere never turns romantic), instead opting for an old-fashioned campfire-story quality where the supernatural is left to our imaginations. While Shock was awash in Bava's painterly image overkill (which suited his purposes), Medak is minimalist to a fault there are some spectacular high- and low-angle shots taken from inside and outside the mansion (like omniscient POV shots from select crevices and corridors) that turn it into a character unto itself; also note the claustrophobic emphasis placed on characters in narrow corridors and stairwells. The first hour of The Changeling is very effective, building slowly to two brilliant scenes the first involves a chest-tightening s√©ance; the second involves Russell listening to the recording of it. But, as is inevitable with film, the plot begins to unravel in its second half, as a string of dark secrets implicating a U.S. Senator (Melvyn Douglas) comes into play. The screenwriters admirably keep the developments as spare as possible, thus maximizing their intended effect--by the end, we are fully convinced that Russell, in his attempts to 'liberate' this spirit, is also trying to purge himself of the grief over his loss. The Changeling is a straight-faced, wonderfully subtle horror film, buoyed by fine performances--Scott especially, whose unlikely presence here lends the character and situation a pathos it might not have had otherwise. Think of it as a refreshing alternative to The Amityville Horror (both versions).(By the way, The Changeling's R rating is deceptive; while some scenes are intense (not explicitly violent), it would drift between a PG or PG-13 by today's standards.)

The following contains a *few* spoilers~~ John (George C. Scott) is a music professor living in New York State with his family. While on vacation, his wife and young daughter, Kathy, are taken from him suddenly in a tragic car accident. Trying to deal with his grief while attempting to somehow move on, he moves to Seattle and finds a job there at a local college, teaching music again. His friends mention to him that the local historical society rents out old homes and maybe, if he'd like, he could rent one. He agrees and soon we are introduced to Chessman House. Things are fine for a little while and we see him settling in with his music, his lessons, etc.  It doesn't take long for the hairs on our little heads to start rising and the goosebumps on our arms to begin forming...little by little. John is dreaming about the day he lost his family and wakes himself up, crying. Suddenly he begins to hear a loud banging and decides to check it out. A repairman tells him that he should remember that saying about old houses...They make sounds,. He shouldn't worry about it because it's probably nothing. But John isn't satisfied, especially after hearing it two days in a row, at precisely 6 in the morning. Not after what he's seen in the attic room. Or the ball that once belonged to his daughter, bouncing down the stairs. Is it just a coincedence that the same piece of music he's playing on his piano is also the same on the child's music box?  He further decides to do some investigating, see about the history of the house. The woman who first showed him the house at Chessman, (Trish Van Devere) gladly helps him and he two begin an aggressive investigation, leading us on while our hearts continue to beat just..a little...bit... faster. We not only recieve a history lesson, we not only learn about The Changeling...we're given a real treat that so few of us can say we've had in the last 10 years.It's refreshing to put this movie into my DVD player and know that I'll be just as scared now as I was when I was 8.

Pick it up on a Friday night, turn out your lights, get under the covers and be prepared to have your imagination tweaked. This movie relies on atmosphere, the little things that you don't notice right away--but will, soon after you've pushed the stop button and tried to get a good night's rest.

However, it is a very good one that relies more on mood and tension than big effects.  There is virtually no gore, and we don't see the ghost until about halfway in.  If you are a person who like to have the monster or killer pop out every twenty minutes or so, then steer clear of this one.  It works more on your nerves than on shock value, although I can think of one part that the ghost pops out that does work.The acting is outstanding and there are some great parts of tension (with the seance and the red ball that won't go away being the best).

Over the course of our viewings, I have learned the meaning of a changeling, and I have finally followed the entire plot!The special effects and music are appropriate to every part of the story, sufficiently scaring us again and again.  Several members of my family have even taken to enacting scenes from the movie here in our own house.  These scenes (which I will not reveal here) scare my daughter to death every time. She has threatened to never watch this movie with me again, but each time she relents.  For those who love being scared -- and by the old-fashioned power of suggestion, not a bunch of gore --this movie is one of the best!I would call the music deliciously eerie.  Congratulations to Rick Wilkins and those who performed the score.  George C. Scott is perfect for the lead role.  His wild-eyed appearance and gruff voice, along with his virile determination to get to the bottom of a mystery hypnotically carries us along. Trish Van Devere is excellent also.  I am especially impressed with her fits of fright and panic!I don't really like the inclusion of a medium and the supernatural because these things can be really real in our world and are best left alone. However, these elements are essential to the story.  I don't know why the film is rated R - only once is there the kind of profanity that would be edited out for broadcast TV release.  Perhaps it is the supernatural element or the (small amount of) violence; I don't know.I am reminded of another one of my favorite movies when watching the Changeling The Uninvited with Ray Milland and Ruth Hussey.

Scott was in some amazing films and, even though this is not as well-known as his earlier work, such as 'Dr. Strangelove' (1964), 'Patton' (1970) or 'The Hindenburg' (1975), I believe his role as heartbroken composer, John Russell to be both one of his warmest and his most unsettling performances out of those of his films that I have seen. He even works well with his real-life wife, Trish Van Devere, who I recognised from the final episode of the original 1970s run of 'Columbo'.In supporting roles, Jean Marsh makes a key dramatic impact as John Russell's tragic wife, whilst John Colicos is in full creepy mode in the small, but important role of Police Captain DeWitt. If, like me, you admire and enjoy old Seventies television series like 'Columbo' and 'Kojak' (to mention the best), you may remember Colicos as a grieving, homicidal father seeking revenge in 'Charlie's Angels'.With the benefit of not having even been born when this film was released, I can say that, for its premise, it sets the scene perfectly, Sure, at times you may feel a bit of deja vu for other, more modern horror films - but those more modern films clearly used their predecessors, such as this, as their templates.The story soon gains depth on a brilliantly unexpected scale, so much so that in it's gripping finale, I felt truly horrified when certain things began to happen that, in other horror films, seem purely routine.However, despite the beautiful blend of both expected and unexpected thrills and chills, what makes this film stand out, in my mind, is the fact that, alike so few other horror films of its time, it does not lose sight of the human side of the plot. Russell's tragedy is absolutely horrifying and instantly makes him a sympathetic character for the audience, which is central to driving his curiosity-turned-obsession about the grand, but lonely house that he has rented in the wake of a personal tragedy.Well-made, very well directed and well acted. Should be on the watch list of every fan of horror and/or psychological thrillers!

It's an incredibly realistic story and beautifully shot film with excellent acting from George C Scott.It tells the story of a composer who purchases a historic old house, after losing his family in a freak accident. Being a rationally minded academic, he starts to investigate when a number of unexplained occurrences take place. His curiosity leads him to uncover an old room, which had been padlocked, boarded up, and hidden away. In it, he finds a music box that plays the exact piece of music that he had seemingly just composed. This confounds him.Under the impression he is being subject to a haunting, he gets in contact with a medium, who uses the automatic writing technique to connect with the spirit which has been trying to get his attention. She discovers that a boy named Joseph Carmichael occupies his house- particularly the room in the attic, where he was killed. The man corroborates this with his own audio recording of the s√©ance- which actually provides him with more information that he can use to further his investigation.By researching both the history of the house and the Carmichaels- a now Senatorial family with their own empire- he is lead to an old parcel of land that used to be the site of the ranch owned by the Carmichael family. He is particularly interested in finding an old well, over which a house has since been built.He manages to convince the homeowner to let him dig up the well. Within it, he finds the frail bones of a long dead young boy. Further investigation leads him to uncover an old medallion that had belonged to the boy.Through these actions, he has gone beyond just helping the spirit with his unfinished business...he is also revealing a deadly conspiracy that will out the skeletons hidden in the Carmichael family's closet.It turns out that the father of the current Senator (the heir of the Carmichael fortune and legacy) had secretly murdered his frail, arthritic son, by drowning him in a tub in the room in the attic; before burying him in the well on their ranch; and replacing the boy with a Swiss orphan, whom they claimed was the miraculously healed Joseph. Though really being his changeling; having replaced the boy and gone on to become heir of the Carmichael empire, himself.But it's clear Joseph's spirit will not rest until the truth is revealed, and vengeance has been reaped. Ultimately leading the film's fiery conclusion.This is an incredibly realistic tale of haunting that focuses on the experience of helping a traumatized spirit with it's unfinished business- one of the numerous types of very real, well documented, ghost-related phenomenon. This discerns it from something like The Entity, which covers a different aspect of the phenomenon- and type of spirit- altogether. The incorporation of a political conspiracy into the story only acts to make it more compelling. The acting in the film is quite solid, the cinematography is beautiful- especially those tracking shots through the house- and the special effects are simple, but effective. For these reasons, the film has deservingly become one of the most renown and respected ghost films of all time. It's an absolute classic that must be seen.9 out 10.

Here you will find all the classic ingredients that went into the best horror stories that ever made you brown your pants as a kid.George C. Scott is composer John Russell, who suffers the accidental deaths of his wife and daughter and moves into a secluded, rambling mansion (aren't they all?) to forget, reflect and compose.The presence in the house won't let him do any of it.What makes rambling, hardwood-floored mansions so intrinsically eerie? Director Peter Medak doesn't have to go too far to create a foreboding atmosphere; every scene holds trepidation, every camera angle on every darkened corridor and whispery staircase seems to cry out that something inexplicable awaits to skew normalcy.That's how the conceptual anomalies of ghosts and poltergeists achieve their scare factor - they shatter what you hold innately to be normal. When you enter your house in the evening gloom, you don't expect a red ball to come bouncing at you from the top of the darkened staircase.And when you take that ball - that belonged to your dead daughter - and throw it into a river to flense her memory, when you come back home, you don't expect that same ball to come bouncing at you from the top of the stairs again! Oeeuuh! I feel the tears brimming my eyes and the hairs on my arms rising! The soundtrack and sound design lends volumes to the eeriness; piano-based motifs and subliminal whispering and lots of knife-like violin jabs.Claire (Trish Van Devere, with a voice like tinkling crystal) is the real estate agent with whom John shares revelations he uncovers about the history of the mansion. The haunting is to right a wrong.And Patton's the man for the job! The mansion's haunted past is revealed as gradually as the supernatural phenomena escalates. There are no sensationalistic hillbillies with axes or elaborate special effects; all the scares are wonderfully subtle and built on solid primal terrors. Loud banging noises awaken John at 6 a.m. every day, a piano note plays itself, a psychic woman scribbles cryptic clues, a tape recording picks up a whispering infant's tragic pleas, a boarded-up attic room is discovered with a tiny cobwebbed wheelchair, doors slam, the P.O.V. camera goes bananas... there's even the old batsh*t-crazy lady who warns The house doesn't want people. And then - Baltar from BATTLESTAR GALACTICA! This movie has everything! But it's not that the house doesn't want people. The house is trying to get the attention of anyone who will listen. And John is psychically shown a true story of real horror that walked the house in 1906. Thus came the changeling. (Oh my God! A changeling! What unspeakable, indescribable, horrific beast that can morph into terrifying... uh, what's a changeling again? Thus did I grow up thinking 'changeling' was some kind of monster...) Written by Russell Hunter, William Gray, Diana Maddox, THE CHANGELING sometimes stoops to silly horror movie conventions during a s√©ance, a steel tube is placed on the table specifically for a ghost to throw against a wall (no strings attached); a woman goes into a dark attic without turning on lights; the obligatory fiery finale. And of course, every time the rule-less world of spirits is breached, my head nearly explodes with the contradictions. Regardless, this movie is so well executed and stands the test of time so well that even though I know what's coming every time I watch it, I still have to change my pants at the end.

Russell soon discovers that the house is haunted by the vengeful and unrestful spirit of a crippled boy who was murdered by his father in the attic 70 years ago. Director Peter Medak, working from a smart and absorbing script by William Gray and Diana Maddox, relates the gripping story at a slow, yet steady pace and does an expert job of building a genuinely spooky and unsettling atmosphere which becomes more increasingly scary and unnerving as the startlingly nasty plot unfolds. This film works remarkably well as a well-sustained creepy mood piece, with a welcome and refreshing emphasis on a supremely chilling and brooding flesh-crawling tone over graphic gore, flashy special effects, and cheap scares. Among the picture's most jolting moments are a ghostly whispered voice on the tape recording of a s√©ance, ominous banging noises ruminating throughout the house at precisely 600 a.m. in the morning, a disturbing flashback set piece with the little boy being drowned in a bath tub, a ball bouncing down a flight of stairs that Russell disposed of by tossing in a river, and a rickety wheelchair coming to fierce life. Scott brings real dignity and intensity to his juicy lead role; he receives fine support from Trish Van Devere as sweet and helpful real estate agent Claire Norman, Melvyn Douglas as rich and powerful Senator Joseph Carmichael, and John Colicos as browbeating police captain De Witt. Sumptuously shot by John Coquillon, with an elegantly eerie orchestral score by Rich Wilkins and a rousing fiery conclusion, this film in its own deceptively quiet and low-key way proves to be a truly potent and hair-raising fright feature winner.

After loosing his wife and daughter in an auto accident John Russell (George C. Scott) heads to Seattle to start teaching and composing music once again and with the help of real estate agent Claire Norman (Trish Van Devere) he moves into a huge house because of the size of the music room.*****SPOILER ALERT***** It doesn't take long before John starts hearing strange noises and finding faucets running by themselves and as he snoops around he discovers a hidden room boarded up inside a closet. He opens it and finds a dusty place seemingly once occupied by a sickly child which prompts him to head to the county records office to investigate the history of the house. He starts to think that his dead daughter is trying to communicate with him but after a spooky s√©ance is performed he finds out that a child was murdered there years earlier and that it was probably done by the father of Senator Joseph Carmichael (Melvyn Douglas) who has to re-think his own identity.This film is directed by Hungarian Peter Medak (The Ruling Class) who even today is still considered a solid director working in both film and television and his professional hand is used well here to create a good ghost story. Along with the splendid cinematography of John Coquillon this film often has the Gothic feel of a ghost story that usually takes place in the New England area and the house that this story takes place in is especially effective. Some consider this one of the best films ever made in this genre but I think there is one or two things that keep this from being truly great and the stoic performance of Scott being the main flaw. After all the creepy things that occur in that gigantic house most would flee in shock but Scott's character just keeps returning and hanging his coat like nothing has ever happened! If ever a film needed an actor to go overboard (even just a little bit) it's this one. Where's Rod Steiger when you need him? Arguably the creepiest scene comes during the s√©ance sequence and it's a lulu that genuinely adds to the chilling atmosphere that is created effectively for the film. Well made film takes time telling it's story but possesses some truly eerie scenes that today's filmmakers hopefully will take note with because all the CGI effects in the world cannot create an atmosphere as good as this.

Unfortunately he has been drawn to a house where a troubled spirit is attempting to communicate with him through a series of increasingly bizarre manifestations.The Changeling really ought to be a first class horror movie, except...what is the deal with George C. Scott?  This is the second movie I've seen him in where he delivered a performance that was unintentionally funny and hammy (the other one was The Exorcist III).  Especially in the closeup shots, he looks like he's going to burst out laughing at any moment, even during the emotionally tense scenes.  More than once I made the unhealthy connection between George C. Scott's performance in horror films and Keanu Reeves's mood-destroying work in Bram Stoker's Dracula.Other than this factor, The Changeling is an excellently crafted ghost story that has not aged well, mostly due to the fact that the story elements were already cliche at the time of its making.  Since 1980, we've seen all of this stuff so much that it's beyond passe (the hidden room in the attic, the ghosts of children tossed into boarded-up wells, jewelry from dead people left as clues, the obligatory seance scene).The best thing about The Changeling is the script.  The story unfolds like clockwork, although I got the impression that the director was trying to make it seem like the main characters were in some sort of danger, when really the intention of the ghost was pretty obvious.  There really was no big conclusion to the plot, and the ending had no surprises.On the plus side, I guess it is the mark of a great movie that it has managed to retain some of its creepiness, and even the aforementioned cliches are very well done (especially the seance).  I can remember this being a lot scarier when I was a kid, which could mean this is a great horror film and I've just seen too many of them to appreciate it anymore.  The movie really captures the gothic allure of a huge, foreboding mansion, and Trish Van Devere's performance is particularly appealing.  I do think the movie is a little overrated, but no fan of the ghost story/horror genre should be too disappointed with this one.

What it has to recommend it is a real plot outside of the spooky stuff, so we don't have to rely on simple terror. That terror is conveyed the way we like, without resorting too much on the startle, or repulsive, gory violence. In theory, it should be more effective as a result. It also should be able to boast good actors. There are two chilling moments, both of which involve animated objects. The most chilling is the appearance of a ball that we know has been discarded. It happens early in the film, before the clumsy plot takes over and when we are still unfamiliar with the house ourselves. The second is at that period in the end where things get frantic and a woman is being chased by a small wheelchair. Its less effective because it does startle, and we know she is only in the story so that she can be in the fully awake haunted house alone at night.But there are some serious flaws. The plot really is quite clunky in how it gets folks lined up in the situations we see. If the house is seen as making things happen supernaturally that wouldn't naturally, then the effect is emphasized by having the plot mechanics be natural. And the acting style as well this surely isn't Scott's best. (His style was apt in They Might be Giants.)Ted's Evaluation -- 2 of 3 Has some interesting elements.

As for this film... There were a few very creepy and scary moments scattered throughout that made the whole film worthwhile. But, I also found it to be too long and convoluted for the story that was being told. It took more than 30 minutes before anything actually started happening. The slow start increased the yawn factor and reduced the over-all rating factor.Several characters just appeared, and it seemed as though they would be important to the story, only to disappear in the convolution. After the s√©ance it became clear that the unfortunate circumstances that befell the original child led to the child communicating with Russell through his grief. Apparently, the child wanted to have things set right so that he could rest in peace. As the film progresses, whenever Russell attempts to set things right, the spirit that is guiding Russell becomes angrier and angrier. Escalating to the violent conflagration at the end. With the complete destruction of the house and it's contents.One is left to wonder why this happened. And it was just downright silly to have the senator show up walking up the stairs. Only after some consideration did I come to the conclusion that the negative angry things that were happening MAY have been caused by the father. But, this was not made clear in the film. Hence the convolution I mentioned earlier. It was a scary film to be sure. A bit confusing and convoluted at times but, definitely worth seeing.

I was especially turned off by the huge amount of unintentional comedy displayed by George C. Scott's ever so earnest face in contrast to Trish Van Devere's scream queen-performance.

There are a lot of little things in The Changeling that wouldn't make it into any movie anymore these days, because people wouldn't buy them.

Scott is a composer and teacher who has just lost his wife and child in an auto accident, which has nothing to do with the story. It's true that when he moves into this mansion his dead daughter's favorite ball keeps bouncing down the stairs while he gapes at it. The ball is harder to get rid of than my credit card debt. He even tosses the ball into a river but it come bouncing back down the stairs. But Cathy is dead and gone and her ball is soon dropped from the narrative. There are some things man was never meant to know.The ball is just an example of what I mean when I say it lacks novelty. After he moves into the house, Scott hears loud booming noises that last for a minute. (The Haunting.) The queer noises change to a fluttering, as of bats or birds in the attic. (The Exorcist.) A woman alone, hearing odd noises, follows them helplessly into dark rooms for no particular reason. (The Birds.) A shuddering chandelier finally drops from the high ceiling and the unconscious man beneath wakes up just in time to roll away. (The Haunting of Hell House.) The musical score is generic haunted house. The script at times is not only routine but a little bizarre. Scott, learning for the first time that a boy was murdered in the house seventy years ago -- faints. Trish Van Devere, when she learns of it, staggers away in a torrent of sobs.The spirit that walks the house is that of that crippled boy who was killed by his father. It's a little tangled and I won't go into it, but when he was young, Senator Melvyn Douglas inherited the whole kit and kaboodle because he was passed of as the true son. Douglas didn't kill anybody. He may not even known what was going on, since he was only a young child at the time of the impersonation. Yet the movie requires his death.But before he succumbs to a stroke or something in his opulent Seattle office, Scott sees Douglas at the mansion, walking in his bath robe up the flaming stairs to a fiery death. The ghost of the murdered boy has powers that evidently extend beyond the haunted mansion, since he can cause lethal auto accidents on a freeway. And when Scott's attempts to lay the ghost reach a dead end, the murdered kid seems to turn against him and tries to kill Scott before deciding, the hell with it, and burning down the whole mansion.I hate being this negative because in some ways it's a very well-done film. Trish Van Devere is herself. She's pretty in a conventional way and has the somewhat sharp but reassuring tone of a customer service representative. Scott is very good. No bombast here. He's quiet, deliberate. Anything else wouldn't fit the character of a puzzled but curious, introverted music professor. He's perfectly believable in the role.

Some have been good, others have been hokey but still fun. Then there are the very exceptional few that are so well done, they truly deserve the right to be called haunting. One of them is a little film produced in 1980 called The Changeling. Written by Russell Hunter and directed by Peter Medak, it presents a tale of mystery, horror, tragedy, revenge from beyond the grave and in the process, becomes the epitome of what ghost films should be.Our story begins with composer John Russell (George C. Scott) witnessing the loss of his wife and little girl (An especially gut-wrenching scene). To try to put his life back together, he decides to move to Seattle so he can teach at his Alma Mater and perhaps even compose once more. Russell ends up renting a large, Victorian house by way of Historic Society agent Clare Norman (Scott's real life wife Trish Van Devere). The house is beautiful, spacious, comes with a piano, and is the perfect place for Russell's needs. However, not long after moving in, it becomes apparent that not all is right with the place when Russell hears loud banging sounds every morning as well as having the sensation that he is not alone in the big place. When he takes his concerns to Ms. Norman, what begins as idle concern soon morphs into the realization that the house is haunted by the spirit of a young boy named Joseph. Who Joseph is, how he died, and what his death has to do with powerful Sen. Joseph Carmichael (Melvyn Douglas) becomes an obsession for Russell and Norman in a race to find out just what the truth is. Only thing is, will they figure it all out to appease the increasingly angry (and powerful) spirit in time?Having seen the film more than once, I can honestly say this movie never fails to enchant, spook, and haunt me no matter how many times I see it, largely because of the little things. In The Changeling you will not find any extravagant effects, no awesome looking make-up or monster, and certainly no fancy CGI. Instead, The Changeling works by having a well crafted story combined with simple effects ( a door opening by itself, strange sounds, misplaced objects, etc.) while our imagination does the rest. In fact, you hardly see the ghost at all. However, believe me when I tell you you'll have no doubt that he's there! Director Peter Medak deserves to be placed with the likes of John Carpenter, Wes Craven, and William Friedkin for creating what has to be one of the creepiest films of all time, as does writer Russell Hunter who reportedly based this story on a personal experience. Through Medak's direction and Russell's writing, the film develops a tone of tragedy, hurt, loss, and creepiness that is prevalent throughout the picture due to the loss of Russell's family and also because of the obvious pain and torment of invisible resident Joseph. As far as acting is concerned, you could not have a better cast. George C. Scott compellingly plays Russell as a man whose world is shattered while having to deal with something beyond his knowledge or understanding. The sadness in his eyes matches the overall tone and feel of the film perfectly and undoubtedly this has to rank as one of his best roles. As for Scott's real life wife, Trish Van Devere, she was never lovelier than here, due to her ability to convey warmth and absolute fear when the occasion calls for it. In addition, Melvyn Douglas is splendid in one of his final film roles as Sen. Joseph Carmichael, a powerful man who's always suspected something doesn't quite make sense in his past and doesn't want anyone to know about it. Whether you believe in ghosts or not, I can guarantee you that The Changeling is a film that will stay with you long after the credits roll and I would even go as far as to say you are robbing yourself by not seeing it. So watch this lovely gem and while you're at it, check under the bed, in the closet, basement, and attic to make sure you don't have something that goes bump in the night.

This film gave me goosebumps that lasted for days when I first saw it in the theatre and it still has that effect on me when I put the tape in my VHS thirty-four years later.As with all really great haunted house films, it is the house that is the star. George C Scott, the human star power of the film, appears here with his wife Trish Van Devere, and delivers a subtle, low-key performance in which a raised eyebrow is as eloquent as Hamlet's soliloquies.Scott plays John Russell, a composer and professor of music. The film begins with a tragedy Russell and his wife Joanna (Jean Marsh) and young daughter Kathy (Michelle Martin) are pushing their disabled station wagon to the side of a snowy road; they are on vacation, presumably headed for the ski slopes. Russell goes across the road to a telephone booth to call for help, and a truck comes along, slipping and sliding on the icy road, and smashes into the Russells' car, killing Joanna and Kathy as John looks on in helpless horror.Scene shift Seattle. John has taken a professorship at the University of Seattle in the hope that the change of scene will shake his depression. With the help of a Claire Norman (Van Devere), a lovely woman from the Historical Society, he finds a handsome old mansion to rent, completely furnished and with a functioning music room, an amenity which attracts the music professor. He moves in.But all is not peaceful in the somewhat gloomy but otherwise handsome old house. The ghostly shenanigans start with nothing but a series of loud bangs that awaken Russell early in the morning. He goes in search of a source but finds nothing.The tension builds from there in a simply brilliant and measured fashion. A woman at the Historical Society warns him that the house does not want people. The events keep escalating until we are deep in a really scary and mystifying story. There is a seance, a voice that appears on a recording even though it was not heard when the recording was made, John and Claire go digging into the house's history, and there is even a real excavation in a child's bedroom, of all places.Add to all this a political connection there is a link between the goings on in the house and the Senator from Washington, Joseph Carmichael (Melvyn Douglas in possibly his last great role). The tension builds until it is almost unbearable, and I won't give away the ending except to say it has a certain feeling of inevitability.George C Scott's performance in this film has been much talked- about; Roger Ebert felt he was too reserved, and that his lack of emoting detracted from the impact of the story. I do not agree. Scott (no doubt with Medak's approval) made the choice to play the educated man as the skeptic, drawing him slowly and unwillingly (also disbelievingly) into the truth of what is happening, and why.I do enjoy a good old fashioned gore-fest, but there is something special about the horror movie that terrifies the viewer without resorting to blood and guts. Sometimes a whispered suggestion is more powerful than a scream. And the passage of thirty-four years has done nothing to diminish the impact of this fascinating and frightening film.

The unknown and the unexpected are far more frightening things than what we can see. Open the door to something that is disturbing or unsettling and our imagination will take over and fill in the blanks in an all too scary manner. That's the genius behind The Changeling directed by Peter Medak. Rather than shock us with blood, gore and violence, this film provides just enough visual, auditory and emotional cues to not only frighten the viewer while watching it, but also to leave enough unspoken that the mind can't help but continue to scare itself long after the film has been seen. The plot is fairly standard haunted house fare. George C. Scott plays a recently widowed husband that takes refuge by renting a large mansion. The mansion is simply a beautiful home that has a dark past. Medak doesn't resort to making it a creepy, ugly place. Rather, he lets small events build the tension and tell the frightening story. Scott provides a subtle performance that lets us feel his emotions without hitting us over the head with them. The result is a character that draws us into his life. We are interested in what happens; through careful pacing and editing we are drawn into his sadness and fear. As the story progresses and a resolution becomes evident, we begin to feel hope that the terror might end. Our hope is satisfied in the end; the cause of the haunting is revealed; an old sin is exposed and the perpetrator both atones for and is punished for it. Equally importantly, our hero not only solves the mystery, he comes to terms with his own pain and begins to heal. As the old wound that caused the haunting is assuaged and no longer painful, so too is the loss that drove him to the haunted mansion. Only memories of the fear and pain remain. This is a brilliant, nuanced film well worth seeing.

After a few days he discovers that the house seems to be inhabited by a restless spirit. He finds a secret stairway to an attic room which belonged to a crippled child. He also discovers that the house once belonged to the wealthy father of a US senator (Melvyn Douglas). It's at this point that the haunted house story becomes a legitimate mystery story.

In the next scene, some time has passed and he's now taking a teaching position at some college in some other part of the country. While things are beginning to look good for the man, he doesn't realize that the mansion he's living in is haunted...I mean REALLY haunted.

The music was very effective, the acting very nice (I especially liked Melvyn Douglas' performance during the confrontation scene with Scott) and the story was just plain creepy.

"},{"Title":"A Masterfully Directed Ghost Story","Date":"3 October 2012","Score":"","Genre":"Fantasy, Horror","Review":" The Changeling is just one of those films that was overshadowed by titles that were deemed superior at the time. The Changeling was a film directed by Peter Medak in 1980. The reason for its lack of audience was due to the rise of the slasher genre in the late 70's. Much like The Shining it was unsuccessful at the box office and was forgotten for a few years. The Changeling has been developing a cult following since the late 90's and it was about time that it got the respect it deserves. The film is well acted with a well put together story that gives me the chills every time I watch.The film opens with John Russell(George C Scott) who is driving down a snowy road with his wife and daughter. The car breaks down and John walks to a phone for assistance. He is then forced to watch as his family is killed by a snowplow. The film takes place nearly a year later with John now a university music teacher moving out of his apartment, it is to small to handle his new job. His search for a large house is brought to Claire Norman(Trish Van Devere) who works for the historical society. John accepts the offer and is brought to his new home, a large towered Victorian style mansion. The house is fully furnished and includes a piano and a music room big enough for John's students to practise. Soon John begins to experience strange happenings in the house. John soon begins discovering the dark secrets buried in the house that date back almost 70 years ago.The acting of the film is great for its small amount of characters. George C Scott delivers one of his best performances along with Trish Van Devere and Melvyn Douglas. Despite the little amount of characters in the story, the film develops them and makes them interesting.The most significant aspect about The Changeling is the atmosphere. I am never going to forget the first shot of the house in the movie. The film does what horror films today should do, create atmosphere. There is nothing scary about a mindless slasher killer or a pool of blood every 10 minutes. The Changeling contains no blood, no gore and little violence yet it still is one of the creepiest films I have ever seen. Peter Medak understood that a spooky atmosphere is the key to truly chilling the audience. Take the s√©ance scene for example. There is no jump scares or scary music needed to creep you out. Medak allows the scene to breath and allows the audience to become engrossed in the scene as if they were sitting alongside the characters. The film has plenty of scenes like this that continue to unnerve me. If you are in the mood to watch an intelligent ghost story, see this movie. I wouldn't recommend watching it by yourself as this film has the tendency to linger with you, even after it's over. But hey, that's the sign of a great movie in my book!

Also, at first the viewer is led to believe the ghost might be a little girl who dies tragically outside the house, but it turns out she lived there after the original occupants which included a boy who had a sister, which added to the confusion because I thought the girl who died, Cora, was his sister, because they said his sister died. But she was the daughter of a doctor, and not the evil Mr. Carmichael. And why did Carmichael want to kill his son? Wouldn't it be easier to control the fortune inherited by an invalid child rather than a healthy one? Perhaps he felt the boy might die, triggering the request in his father-in-law's will that the money would then go to charity. But the situation with the little girls, both of whom died, was not explained well at all. Otherwise, a superb and unusual film.

I will go to the grave with my opinion that PARANORMAL ACTIVITY was terrifying, as well as parts of both versions of THE WOMAN IN BLACK. THE CHANGELING was recommended to me one day by a bearded man with an eye patch (who was a complete stranger) at a book store. Needless to say, I watched it ASAP.John Russell is a composer who has recently lost his wife and daughter in a truck accident and decides to move into a huge, old mansion. Soon, strange things begin going on and John begins to dig into the history of the house, discovering its shocking history.I went into THE CHANGELING expecting just your standard, things-go-bump haunted house story. I knew it could be scary, but I didn't know anything about it. I also saw it was 115-minutes long. That's way too long! I proclaimed. How are they going to keep this running? Well, as it turns out, there's a whole lot more to the story than I expected, and I loved it. I can't say much about what separates this from other haunted house movies because half the enjoyment I got out of it was being surprised at where it went.There aren't any jump scares in THE CHANGELING (from what I remember it). It's all creepy things like doors opening by themselves, strange noises coming from the attic, and a child whispering. However, it's not limited to just these things, which are creepy enough. There's one scene where a woman just stops and stares up a flight of stairs, and then we get to see what she's staring at and it scared me to death! THE CHANGELING is certainly very professionally made as well, with likable characters, great acting, very spooky atmosphere, fantastic camera shots, and a solid pace. It may seem slow by most standards, but the time really flew by when I watched it. It's one of the few films that have actually made me afraid to go near my closet for fear of what might be inside after watching this.This is essential viewing for all horror fans, even if it's not a film you'll find yourself revisiting every week. It's a good nostalgia trip back to the days when films didn't rely on blood, gore, or even cheap jump scares to frighten audiences.Quintessential viewing for all ages.

Scott moves to Washington State after a tragic accident that takes away his wife and young daughter, he leases a large but mysterious house from the historical society. It is soon very clear that someone (or something) lives there besides him, as loud banging noises start recurring, balls begin bouncing down the stairs, and doors mysteriously start opening with nobody present but him. Scott begins to work with the historical society representative (Trish Van Devere) who rented him the house to solve the mystery, and what he finds out is more shocking than the initial research he did. Scott befriends the unseen spirit after finding a mysterious room behind a wall, and does all he can to help unleash the obvious agony this ghost is in. This brings on revelations concerning a powerful local man (Melvyn Douglas) that could destroy a dynasty.Gripping from the start, The Changeling is both horrific and sad, with its ghost story evoking compassion and anger from its leading character. Scott is outstanding as he goes from grieving widower and father to antipathetic resident of the obvious haunted house to someone whose own grief makes him want to solve the mystery he has uncovered. His real-life wife Van Devere offers fine support as she realizes that the house holds a secret that goes way beyond the records she had access to at the historical society. Once the mystery begins to unfold, the film becomes extremely tense, not letting go of its audience until the final credits roll. The revelation is simply too intense to even give hints about, so I will only go as far to say that it is something the viewer will not see coming.I was also delighted to see the wonderful Madeline Thornton-Sherwood (Cat on a Hot Tin Roof's Sister Woman & The Flying Nun's Reverand Mother) in the small role of Van Devere's mother. John Colicos, whom General Hospital fans would see soon afterwords trying to freeze the world as Mikkos Cassadine, has a small but memorable role. This is perfect Halloween viewing for a cold, rainy night, and certainly much better than the rampage of slasher movies that Hollywood began making around the same time. Like Ghost Story, Burnt Offerings, The Amytiville Horror, and Poltergeist, the house, too, is a character, one that might look inviting during the light of day, but becomes sinister as night falls.

The convoluted history that Scott unravels is not especially interesting, and eventually the film starts to go too big (the musical score, while often very good, becomes way too oppressive during some of the big scare sequences). Still, while I wouldn't quite rank it up there with the best ghost movies like The Haunting or The Innocents, it's not too far below them. Scott is great, and Melvyn Douglas has a good role, too. I liked Trish Van Devere, the lead actress, in some of the scenes, but whenever she got hysterical she was annoying. I mean, she knows damn well that the house is haunted, and that she's scared witless by it, but she continues to enter the house every day. I think I'd just stay the Hell away.

This last one is usually listed as a horror movie, but that description doesn't do it justice. It has a number of the characteristics of horror movies creepy old house, unexplained sounds, and a protagonist trying to find out the truth about what happened. But the movie focuses as much on those as it does on the effects that the events have on the protagonist.George C.

Claire Norman (Trish Van Devere, Scott's final wife), a woman from the historical society, helps John find a house. But sure enough, this house has a terrifying history...and the answer is closer than he realizes.The Changeling eschews the direction that horror flicks were taking in the '70s and '80s it contains no sex, and limited violence. The main focus is on how John experiences the mysterious occurrences, and how he slowly but surely finds out what happened in his new residence so many years earlier. Some scenes did make me jump a little bit. The movie is a bit like The Ring, but more interesting the non-emphasis on special effects gives it a more realistic feeling.All in all, this is definitely one that I recommend. It's not absolutely frightening in the vein of The Shining, but definitely chilling.

After The Exorcist managed to stomp through the box office like Big Foot on a raping spree through a school yard, it showed that the genre didn't have to be relegated to the second bill on a B movie matin√©e to make some serious cash. It was the perfect coupling of big budget, hot young director and a talented cast, and this formula was thankfully to repeat again throughout the decade with the likes of The Omen, Jaws, Alien and The Amityville Horror following closely on it's heels.By the time The Changeling hit the big screen, many a 'respected' director had taken a stab at the often ridiculed genre, with Philip Kaufman turning up the chills with his Invasion of the Body Snatchers remake, and the 'other' haunted house flick of 1980, The Shining, being directed by a nobody called Stanley Kubrick. So, how does The Changeling hold up to all these heavy weight horror contenders? Taken on it's own merits, The Changeling punches holes through the skulls of the likes of Amityville Horror like Ricky Oh pulverizing a bunch of badly acted prison inmates. We get off to a grim start, with John Russell (George C Scott), a music composer, who loses his family in a freak car accident on a snowy road. Several months later he seems to be on the road to recovery, and is offered a university lecturing job in Seattle. He decides to rent a stately historical home to stay in, and hopefully start him off fresh in his new life. It's not long though before he gets woken by loud banging noises, and soon he discovers a boarded up door leading to the attic. Here he finds a dust covered child's wheelchair, and other ancient curiosities.It seems that there is the spirit of a young boy trying to communicate with John, and the more he delves into the history of the house, the darker the past seems. How did Joseph die? and how is it connected with the state senator? Will John escape with his marbles intact? Watch it and see, yo! What we have here is a seriously creepy haunted house slow burner. The film takes it's time to build character, and allow the atmosphere to creep up nicely with excellent use being made of the central location. The scares may seem standard at this stage, but they are well executed, and it makes a damned scary use of a s√©ance scenario that always manages to get a bit of pee out of my willy. Another stand out scare moment involves the clinically eerie wheelchair, and scene when a younger girl foolishly wanders into her haunted bedroom late at night. Don't worry little girl, I was screaming along side you! One of the great things about The Changeling is Mr George C Scott. He carries the emotional bulk of the film on his hefty shoulders, and really lets loose when required. It's refreshing to see an actor as established as Scott was delving into the genre and really giving it his all. To see an elderly actor cast as the lead in a horror film is quite a surprise, it's something that would never happen in this day and age. His performance really helps sell the latter stages of the film that don't work quite as well as the first half. Unfortunately the film slightly derails in the last act, after a great false ending that will remind eagle eyed horror fans of the climax of Ringu. Don't worry though, the problems are only minimal and won't ruin the film for you, it just felt a tad OTT.If you are fans of films like The Haunting, The Innocents, or even The Amityville Horror, you need to see this. It's serious, scary, and well acted. And really, when it comes to haunted house flicks, these are the essentials. Not big, flashy special effects or gore, just straight up old fashioned chills.

The Changeling is an atmospheric chiller of paranormal phenomena and a ghostly mystery. The intelligent and highly competent film-maker avoids showing too much, thereby encouraging the viewer's imagination to churn out fear.The haunted mansion becomes a character in its own right, and George C. Scott is utterly convincing as the composer who seems summoned to the house after the deaths of his wife and daughter.This movie contains several scenes that will truly make the hair on the back of your neck stand up. Much more effective than most newer horror films - and no decapitations or spurting blood!If you enjoy getting the bejabbers scared out of you but are turned off by the gory overkill of films like John Carpenter's Vampires, watch The Changeling.Best viewed when you're alone in the house on a dark, quiet night.

It is a mystery story of why John Russell, the widowed composer/teacher is haunted by a spirit who is only explained once he sees to having a medium come to his house to communicate with the ghost. It was discovered who the ghost really was after the seance, and the rest of the story consisted of finding out what the spirit really wanted. Slowly, the bits of the story come together as one clue after another is added to the whole mystery, and it all begins to add up as the people in the film are revealed for who they truly are, and what their motivations end up being. I won't spoil it with revealing the ending. All I'll say is that the OUTSTANDING cast makes this a very watchable picture, with a very satisfactory ending which leaves nothing to the imagination concerning what it was all about. Unlike many movies of this type, which try to titillate us with squirrelly endings that don't fully explain what it was all about, this film didn't fall into that trap. It doesn't have to explain anything, because following the plot is not at all difficult. You don't have to continually try to figure out what's happening, which is a welcome relief from all the films of this type that feel they have to make us figure it out as we go along, and then leave us hanging at the end with a silly plot twist, or some completely out of the blue scene that leaves us unfulfilled and scratching our heads as we leave the room. This film delivers completely on all counts. Great story line, great acting by a truly professional cast, and nothing left to the imagination, except why don't they make more movies like this?

And I have to admit that there are elements that make this a solid movie. But overall I was quite disappointed with this movie. Now I do think it has to do with the fact that this movie relies on using your own fear and imagination. You could perceive this movie as scary as you like since this movie gives you room to interpret matters on different levels. And this is probably it's strength and at the same time it's downfall. If you are an avid fan of horror movies than i'll doubt you will find this movie scary or chilling at all. Because the presented events aren't really original or refreshing. Casual viewers will be more impressed I think. The mystery itself wasn't that compelling either. With movies concerning haunted mansions you know that there is a story behind it and finding out what that story is part of the fun. This finding out part in the movie wasn't that interesting in the first place. It also didn't help that George C.Scott was far too calm and accepting when he was confronted with the so called scary events. Keep your expectations low with this one.

Scott) loses his wife and daughter in a freak accident, and moves from New York to Seattle to start over. But the historical mansion he moves into hides a nasty secret not only is there a ghost, but a murder and a family secret that could have major consequences for a political empire.I picked this movie up a few years ago after hearing my friend Trixie speak so highly of it. I am not really sure why I give her opinion so much weight, as she has mostly led me to watch horrible garbage like Lucky and Red Riding Hood and hideous films like Slaughtered Vomit Dolls. She did show me Strings, though, so I guess she did something right.Now, do not get me wrong. The Changeling is a good movie. It has a slow, suspenseful pace and interesting characters. But it is a horror film that requires the right viewing environment. It has to be savored like a fine wine, not watched at a party or while getting drunk with a friend. There is plenty of effort going into the mood and atmosphere, but no blood and no body count. I watched this film a second time and enjoyed it much more than the first, knowing ahead of time that I had to savor the pacing. This is not a film for those with ADD.The atmosphere, as I said, is key. This is a mood picture, with the musical score really carrying the film. On top of the score is the incorporation of classical music -- the protagonist is a composer -- and that only adds to the layered feel of the film. How much the music carries the film may be overlooked if you do not open yourself to it, as it is both powerful and subtle.I found George C. Scott to be a wonderful and capable actor, although his Patton voice was distracting at times. I kept waiting for him to say Americans traditionally love to fight, but he does not. This is not Scott's fault -- this is my fault for listening to Jackyl. Yes, you can hold that against me. Chainsaws as musical instruments are cool.The character of Minnie Huxley also set a nice tone. I appreciate the ominous elderly person in a film, especially after Crazy Ralph in Friday the 13th. This film not only anticipates Friday, but more so Stir of Echoes -- Russell composes a song not unlike the music box (Kevin Bacon plays the Rolling Stones on his guitar) and both try to find a murder victim by digging in a house.Director Peter Medak is now considered one of the masters of horror. He may deserve this honor, he may not. His career is varied so that I do not think he necessarily gets thought of as a horror director. But, I will say The Changeling was notable and influential -- Martin Scorsese, for one, considers it inspiring -- and for that Medak deserved recognition. I would personally suggest you see this film, though do not go out of your way.

Perhaps because of the latter, some of the supporting performances bring to mind seventies TV rather than Val Lewton - shallow and silly. But you don't really go looking for depth or high seriousness in a haunted house movie, do you? You go looking for the creeps. And there's some real good ones here. I'm partial to the extended sequences centering on the rubber ball and the well; the wheelchair is a good idea too but they milk it a bit too hard. George C. Scott may not get much of a workout, but he does carry the film almost single-handedly for long stretches, and the leads are each given one fleeting emotive moment to heighten our engagement.

No hysterical fright, no moral imperative to do something or irrational behaviour there is a problem, we have evidence to determine that, so there must be a solution.

A very solid movie of both tension and great acting.It is hard to feel scared these days and even harder to relate to the characters.

Where did he go? At one time this hired hand made one of the underrated horror films (or just not as hugely popular as the other crazy-ass house horror flick of 1980, The Shining), The Changeling, which took a pretty recognizable premise (widowed man, George C. Scott, takes up residence in a big house that, color us shocked, is haunted by the presence of a boy who died in a room locked away with dark familial secrets soon to be revealed) and made it invigorating with real scares and sharp direction. It's sometimes even close to intoxicating direction; not quite Argento but just enough to get the blood boiling the fingernails curled up for the next big shock that may or may not occur.And while, as mentioned, some parts of the plot are predictable (not least of which if one has seen the slightly superior The Beyond by Fulci), the performances from Scott and especially Melvyn Douglas are terrific and many scenes are unforgettable as should-be horror bits like the s√©ance or the wheelchair possessed chasing after the woman, or just the creepy ambiance given by the boy's spider-webbed bedroom. It relies on a lot of moments of tension and unrest in a conventional sense, but always pulled off with professional skill (no crap logic to the supernatural things or the special effects, or the writing for that matter) and lack of hackery. Hell, the death of the boy alone is worth recommending the film alone... that doesn't sound right, but it makes sense in context of the movie.

It's complete with an eerie tone, creepy voices and tele-porting objects. This film is not for the faint of heart.Sadly, films like this aren't made anymore.

It's the sort of dark and uneasy atmosphere, that at the same time feels also really natural, which makes it perhaps all the more creepy and effective. The movie is definitely helped by its most excellent cinematography and eerie musical score by Rick Wilkins, that is a great example for its genre. Who is this man and why did he composed for so few movies? It's truly an horror movie that is made great by its atmosphere. This also means that the horror within this movie is more implying than anything else really. This means that the movie is filled with mostly returning eerie sounds, sudden opening doors and other strange unnatural things that are occurring. So a lot of things are also being implied without actually showing too much. These type of horror movies are often among the best and most effective within its genre. The movie also does a good job at making the haunted house and all of its rooms and elements within it a true character within the movie.It also helps the movie that it still has- and is made in a typical '70's style, despite the fact that this movie was released in 1980. The style of this movie should remind you of other genre classics from the '70's such as The Omen and Don't Look Now for instance.The movie of course also gets uplifted by the fact that the movie its main character is being played by George C. Scott. Melvyn Douglas also plays a role. Douglas is mostly known for his roles in '40's movies so seeing him in this movie, in the 80's, was quite a pleasant blast from the past. Also Jean Marsh makes an appearance within this movie.It's definitely true though that the movie sort of gets 'worse' and looses some of its power throughout the movie. The first two-thirds is truly excellent and basically couldn't had been better, with its excellent implying horror and atmosphere. In the last third the mystery already gets sort of explained, which of course takes away some of the tension of the movie. You can say that the movie is perhaps overwritten and the movie would had been better, or at least more effective, without a cleverly written and constructed story that explains its mysterious things and all. The movie could had been a real true perfect genre classic but it's now more sort of a semi-classic and semi-must-see.Quite a shame that this movie just isn't any better known, since its definitely among the best and most classy genre movies.8/10http//bobafett1138.blogspot.com/ "},{"Title":"Scary parts","Date":"9 February 2008","Score":"","Genre":"Fantasy, Horror","Review":" This movie was personally one that was scary for me.

Scott (one of my favorite actors of all time) didn't dabble in the horror genre too often, but when he did, he picked really classy projects (EXORCIST 3 for example; an under-appreciated gem). THE CHANGELING is his best. In this film, Scott plays one John Russell, a composer/teacher who loses his wife and daughter in a horrific roadside tragedy (gut-wrenching, but thankfully un-gory). Seeking solitude, a grief-stricken Russell then moves into a remote, creaky, old house near Seattle. Soon after, unexplained sounds and poltergeist activity plague him (in subtle ways by today's standards; that single, ominous ball dropping onto the steps!). He tries to research the house (and receives cryptic warnings). Finding no real answers in that avenue, he turns to the parapsychology department of his own university. A very 'productive'(i.e., trouser-soaking) s√©ance soon convinces Russell a young, disabled boy named Joseph Carmichael met a hideous end at the hands of his father, who replaced his sickly heir with an adopted one (hence the title) who grows up to become a powerful, wealthy senator. Russell means to confront the senator and try to give Joseph (and himself) some peace. George C. Scott conveys the vulnerability and grief of his character beautifully (especially the scene where he's sobbing after a nightmare of his family's death); a total 180 from the confidence and arrogance of Scott's PATTON. The ghost voices, and the sight of that empty, cob-webbed wheelchair viciously chasing Trish van deVere (Scott's real-life spouse) down that narrow staircase will cure any and all types of constipation! Guaranteed! This is the type of ghost story they simply DON'T make enough of anymore. Mood is allowed to build. The acting is top-drawer. No gore. No obnoxious, fresh-off-the-Mac CGI effects cluttering up the screen. And watch this movie at night, in relative darkness, and I DARE anyone NOT to have cold chills run down the their spinal cord! THE CHANGELING's closest cinematic relatives would be STIR OF ECHOES (a very good, modern horror film; seems like a contradiction these days!) and to a lesser extent, LEGEND OF HELL HOUSE (1973). If you can get CHANGELING on DVD, and you have an attention span greater than a common house fly, there will be many, truly hair-raising scares awaiting (and rewarding) you. After THE CHANGELING came out in 1980, the old-style, subtle ghost-story went into a long slumber, revived properly (after 19 years) with SIXTH SENSE and STIR OF ECHOES (ECHOES is the better film of these two in a near photo-finish). Some new millennium Japanese horror (RINGU, JU-ON) have also tried to revive this sub-genre with mixed results (seriously; ENOUGH with the long-haired, green-skinned dead girls already!). Despite this new competition, George C. Scott's CHANGELING is still (almost 30 years later) the finest (and SCARIEST) ghost story ever made.

At first thinking that it might be the plumbing John soon realizes that what's happening in the Chessman House is not of this, or of the living, world.John getting in touch with Seattle Historical Society curator Claire Norman, Trish Van Devere, the two find this secret room in the attic that housed a young and crippled, with his wheelchair still being there, boy. Checking out the records of the Chessman House it's found out that the house belong to the now powerful Washington State Senator Joseph Carmichael's, Melvyn Douglas, parents! Something just doesn't check out here with the house through it's strange and unexplained noises as well as a reading from world famous medium Leah Harmon, Helen Burns, that shows whoever is making these sounds has been dead for over 50 years! If the dead child, or ghost, in question making these strange sounds isn't Senator Carmichael, who's very much alive, then who is he? Did the senator have a twin brother that nobody knew about?John who at first would never believe all this ghostly and supernatural hogwash is now convinced that there was something to the story about a murder at the Chessman House and that somehow Senator Joseph Carmichael, who was just an infant when it happened, gained the most out of it. With the information that he got from the medium Leah as well as his recording of it, that picked up sounds that were inaudible to the human ear, John tracks down the remains of the murdered boy to Elizibaeth Gray, Frances Hyman, house. It's the Gray house that was once the property of Senator Carmichael's father and it's there, in a now sealed and buried well, where the young boys body was found! Also found there is evidence that the murdered boy, also named Joseph Carmichael, not Senator Carmichael was was the elder Carmichael's son!With this discovery on both John and Calire's part the awful truth about Senator Carmichael starts to come out and the Senator then uses all of his power and influence to keep it from seeing the light of day even if he has to resort to bribery or even murder. The movie The Changling takes a while to get off the ground but it has so many loose ends to tie up, before it really gets down to business, that you can't be critical of it for it's almost snail-like pacing.When the film explodes in the last ten minutes you already know what's the secret behind the house and Senator Carmichael's connection to it.

Given all of the reviews, I was expecting a really scary horror movie. However, this movie would be best described as a mystery/thriller rather than horror as it offers very few genuine scares. In fact, change the musical score and it could pretty well play out as a straight up mystery. I would have to call this pretty lightweight horror. If you're really a fan of horror and are looking for a good scare, this movie will likely disappoint you. It tries to generate tension and atmosphere through the use of relatively well-done cinematography and a menacing score, but it's all talk and no real payoff. The suspense ultimately just peters out and part of the problem is that the protagonist never seems genuinely afraid. I found the set piece with the wheelchair chasing the female character more laughable than horrifying. Overall, I was quite disappointed as this film didn't meet the expectations that I had based on other reviews here.

"},{"Title":"One of the best ghost stories ever","Date":"6 December 2006","Score":"","Genre":"Fantasy, Horror","Review":" Since its first apparition in horror fiction around the 18th century, stories about ghosts have become one of the most important elements in the genre, and as such, soon they were portrayed in every single media available. Film was not an exception, and so movies with ghosts or a haunting as plot device have been done since the invention of cinematography. The Changeling continues this tradition of stories, following the Gothic approach of the haunting and the mystery that goes with the journey. Apparently it wasn't well received when it came out (although it won the Genie award), but fortunately, it's finally getting the recognition it truly deserves as one of the best ghost stories ever put on film.The Changeling is the story of John Russell (George C. Scott), a successful musician and composer who one day during a vacation lost his wife and daughter in a tragic car accident. Still recovering from the shock, he moves to a huge abandoned mansion in Chessman Park that belongs to the Historical Society in an attempt to rebuilt his life, however, he begins to experience a series of supernatural events that seems to be related to the house's past and the mysterious events that took place there. While reluctant at first, soon Russell will discover that the dark presence that inhabits the Mansion has a very specific purpose for him.Based on a story by Russell Hunter, the movie was written by William Gray and Diana Maddox, who cleverly built a captivating mystery that slowly unfolds as Russell's investigation takes place. Putting the genre's conventions to good use, the writers follow closely the Gothic pattern for ghost stories without moving away from the mystery. This focus on the secrets and Russell's research really make the story very interesting, and the fact that the characters are likable and very well developed just adds to the effectiveness of the movie. Like a hybrid between detective novel and horror film, The Changeling not only offers a creepy and scary story, it also allows the audience to identify with Russell and feel the excitement of the investigation.Director Peter Medak creates an enormously atmospheric movie that really takes good advantage of the story's Gothic style, making it one of the scariest films of the 80s. With and elegant and classy cinematography (by John Coquillon), Medak uses the location to make the Mansion itself an important character in the movie, and like Robert Wise did decades before in The Haunting, succeeds in making a horror movie where the terror comes from subtle and simple objects instead of complicated special effects. This focus on the suspense and the Gothic elements of the movie perfectly fits the mystery of the plot, resulting in an overwhelming atmosphere of dread that doesn't end until the secret is revealed.Better known for his amazing performance in Patton, George C. Scott once again shows his enormous talent as the tortured John Russell. Scott's acting is natural and realistic, and easily makes the character come to life with a charm that makes hard not to feel identified with him. Scott's real life wife Trish Van Devere plays his character's counterpart, Claire Norman, in a character that easily could had become a clich√©. Like Scott, Van Devere's natural performance enhances the film's mix of realism with dark fantasy, and while her screen time is considerably smaller, her performance is effective. The film has also great performances by Melvyn Douglas, Jean Marsh and John Colicos in the supporting roles.The Changeling has slowly build up a reputation as one of the forgotten great films of the 80s, and for the most part the film lives up to the hype. It's certainly creepy and director Medak really conveys great doses of suspense in the story, although fans expecting something more graphic will be sorely disappointed. In a way, the film can be seen as the opposite of Spielberg's Poltergeist (another great ghost story, in my opinion), as both films tell the story of a haunting, but with completely different styles. The Changeling's restrained Gothic style will definitely not be appealing to all, but those familiar with The Haunting will find a good heir to that awesome movie here.Lately this film has quickly finding it's well deserved recognition, as this modest Canadian film can truly stand proudly among the classics. It's often said that one should not believe the hype surrounding films, but in this case, the hype is right and The Changeling is great. Fans of Gothic films, this is a must. 9/10 "},{"Title":"Scary thriller is a chilling ghost story...","Date":"4 November 2006","Score":"","Genre":"Fantasy, Horror","Review":" THE CHANGELING sets out to frighten the wits out of you, and it largely succeeds. At least it was frightening enough to cause a friend of mine not to continue watching it, as she was alone in the house and didn't want nightmares of things that go bump in the night.She missed a good ghost story, extremely well acted by GEORGE C. SCOTT, as a man who, after the tragic death of his wife and son in an accident, visits a realtor (TRISH VAN DEVERE) and purchases an old house in the country. Sure, there are the usual horror clich√©s but they're all done very effectively and keep you watching and wondering what the hauntings are all about.Other films have dealt with this sort of material before, including the well-known THE HAUNTING (which I, personally, found disappointing and pretentious in its efforts to chill). Or the more blatant chills of THE HOUSE ON HAUNTED HILL or any of the John Carpenter films. But THE CHANGELING, in its own quiet and creepy way, is the scariest one of them all.GEORGE C. SCOTT is often guilty of overacting, but here he plays the role well within the bounds of the script, and is nicely supported by his own real-life wife, TRISH VAN DEVERE. Some may not be too satisfied with an ending that attempts to tie up the loose ends, but as a sheer study of the supernatural (including a seance scene which is quite powerful), this ranks among the best of its kind.Well worth staying up to watch--unless you're afraid of being alone.

And then there are those that have that cold kind of edge as sharp as a scalpel digging underneath your skin to raise pumpkin-sized goosebumps on your arms and the back of your neck. THE CHANGELING is one of those films that fits squarely into the latter category.The less you know about this film, the scarier it is, so here's all you're gonna get from me the great George C. Scott plays a composer in self-imposed seclusion following the tragic deaths of his wife and daughter. He finds a huge mansion to move into to be alone with himself and his work, but he soon finds out that he's NOT as alone as he wants to be. And his new 'company' has something important to tell him, whether he wants to listen or not...Director Peter Medak is the kind of filmmaker who misses spectacularly when he's off the mark, but succeeds brilliantly when he's on. And it's hard for him to go wrong here with an excellent script by Russell Hunter, William Grey and Diana Maddox, and a top drawer cast led by Scott, which includes Trish Van Devere, Melvyn Douglas, John Colicos, Barry Morse and Jean Marsh. Several composers including Kenneth Wannberg contribute some fittingly eerie music for the score, including a beautiful theme that will haunt your memories for a good long while.Camera-work, art direction, editing...this is an example of what masterful film-making can be at its best, and it certainly gave the ghost story genre a good name when it was released.So if you're not a fan of buckets of blood and fake boo scare tactics, you need to see THE CHANGELING. It might not best such classic creepers as Robert Wise's THE HAUNTING or THE INNOCENTS, but it comes pretty damn close.

Although the thrills are accomplished the same way, just atmosphere and acting, I find that the story is more interesting and the characters more real. I think the reason why this movie is so effective in scaring you is because no over-the-top CGIs or special effects are used to constantly remind you that this is a big movie production. The scares are provided by simple, everyday things like a ball bouncing and a piano playing. This movie sets the bar that all other ghost movies have yet to reach.

Poor John, the opening scene of the movie his wife and son are both run down in a car accident pretty much setting the tone of the movie to that of very depressing.

If you like mystery and what not, you should love this.My only complaint was a lack of forward motion. I wish some of the scenes weren't so drawn out and that things would move along quicker.

It is definitely a gem. George C. Scott is a great actor, and does a wonderful job in the film. The story is genuinely creepy and sent chills down my spine on many occasions, mostly when the little ghost was speaking and making himself known throughout the film. The eerie camera-work that is used from the ghost's perspective was spooky, and the chasing wheelchair was downright creepy. The old wheelchair in the attic, combined with the creaks and groans of the old house, and the house itself give a creepy enough atmosphere. The sequence in the well jolted me out of my seat too, it's pretty rare when a movie does that to me. There are so many little eerie moments throughout the film that are really creepy.Bottom line - I have to say this is probably one of the best ghost stories I've seen.

The scene of the rubber ball bouncing down the stairs AGAIN after John Russel threw it off of a bridge into Puget Sound stayed with me forever. I saw the movie as a 12 year-old and that image stuck with me. 20 years later I could not forget the singular image of the ball bouncing down the stairs and the look of shear terror and disbelief of the protagonist facing this haunting image. No FX, no gore, no dramatic music... just the quiet cadence of a bouncing ball that is supposed to be at the bottom of the abyss.

One day in a fit of boredom, I decided to recapture that singular image. So I goggled 'bouncing red ball down the stairs. Low and behold, one of the first hits was The Changeling.

This movie blends the traditional ghost story with some detective/mystery techniques. George C. Scott is great as the most unlikely recipient of supernatural happenings - due to his past portrayal of figures such as 'Patton'. A Christopher Walken could have possibly played this role, but Chris would have looked 'too much at home' in the setting. Scott is a very practical-minded character who is unwillingly drawn into finding the truth behind the disturbances. His character has a noticeably gruff exterior which would mislead the viewer if not for the opening of the movie. It's clear that John Russell, played by Scott, is ripe for such an experience perhaps because of the recent tragedy in his life. The pain of losing not just a wife but a child makes him the prime candidate that the restless spirit of Joseph will reach out to. And that's all I'm going to say.

His solitude is soon interrupted however by ghostly phenomena; weird banging sounds, a walled-up room and a vision of a dead child. Convinced he is not imagining anything, Russell resolves to uncover the history of the house in an effort to explain its haunted qualities.This is one of the best ghost stories ever filmed, a true spine-chiller if ever there was one. If you don't experience sweaty palms, sudden chills and the hairs on your skin prickling on viewing this terrific Canadian horror movie, then check into your local morgue now because you're already dead. Gifted Hungarian director Medak has created a suspenseful, mysterious and nerve-shreddingly frightening film in the subtle tradition of The Haunting and Curse Of The Demon. The creepy house story itself is quite familiar but the context of the haunting, involving an unspeakable murder of a crippled child for both financial and political gain is truly original and fascinating. Investigating the mystery, Scott gives a dogmatic powerhouse performance (ably supported by real-life wife Van DeVere) that sweeps you into the mystery and lends the supernatural events tremendous authenticity. It's impossible not to admire his character's dignity and tenacity; when the local town gossip and a bullying cop try to frighten and intimidate him into abandoning the case, it only strengthens his resolve to find out more. The house is a stunning piece of set design, labyrinthine and darkly-lit with mysterious hallways spiralling up to unknown realms, and there is fantastic use of sound-effects to convey its gloominess and tragedy, as well as a great piano score by Rick Wilkins. Perhaps best of all in a near-flawless film is John Coquillon's stunning photography, which is delicate, unhurried, polished and amazingly unsettling, selling the movie's many great scares with shot-perfect precision (for other examples of his great skill as a cameraman, check out Sam Peckinpah's Cross Of Iron or The Osterman Weekend).

This is the kind of film, I must add, that should be turned up loud, as there is a lot of almost subliminal weirdness going on on the soundtrack...especially during the seance scene, one of the scariest I've ever witnessed. This film deserves its pantheon place alongside the other truly scary haunted-house flicks, such as The Haunting (1963), House on Haunted Hill (1958) and The Legend of Hell House (1973). Watch it on a hot summer night when your AC is on the fritz; it'll chill you to the bone in no time, for sure!

Watching this 25 year old movie now, I cannot avoid being a bit conditioned to this type of horror film; more recent movies that come to mind with a similar plot are Gothika, The Ring, The Shining and The Grudge...to name a few. Therefore, the impact could never be as big as it should be. Still, this film hasn't really aged much; the execution displayed here is excellent. Unlike the films I mentioned above (minus The Shining of course), the acting here is first-class. The house is the star of the film, and it's filmed brilliantly; Kubrick's work in The Shining comes to mind. The score is absolutely chilling, one of the best I've ever heard. The camera work is among the best I've seen in this genre; particularly the shot looking down into and out from the well, as well as the Steadicam shots and the obscure angles used.An overall first-rate horror film executed much better than the garbage being put out nowadays.

Unfortunately, The Changeling wasn't much of any of those to be honest and it was such a huge let down.I knew it was made back in 1980 so I knew it would be different in style from today's movies, which doesn't bother me as one of my favourite movies, for example, is The Exorcist. However, the era when these two films were made is where the comparison stops because to compare the two in movie quality is like comparing Pearl Harbour to Saving Private Ryan.The Changeling had great promise as it started out really well with the story being built up nicely as it went along. Unfortunately, after the initial build up and development, it just stalled and came to a shuddering halt resulting in it falling completely flat on it's face. Where's the great atmosphere? Where's the great creepiness? Where's the great acting & character portrayal? Absolutely nowhere, apart from two or three scenes which did have a decent atmospheric creepy feeling.It actually got very slow & boring after about 45 minutes. Oh, and as for the great acting? Non-existent and was pretty abysmal at times.

By 1980, the great George C. Scott's career was at a low enough ebb that he got sucked into a routine chiller called The Changeling, bringing with him his lovely wife Trish Van Devere and Oscar-winning Hollywood legend Melvyn Douglas. As a result, a TV-scale idea gets major-studio scale production, kind of like a One Direction song being played by the Chicago Symphony Orchestra.Speaking of classical music, Scott plays the only famous American composer of the latter 20th century, who must have married, to put it charitably, late in life, since he's mourning the wife and preteen daughter who die in a freak accident before the opening credits. The opening sequence should be scarifying but actually reminds the viewer of a little-noted horror movie trope the happier the character appears, the more likely they are to buy it. Having survived this clich√©, the Scott character heads straight for another one by moving into a -- natch! -- spooky old mansion, which he rents via small-town Realtor Van Devere and has some convoluted connection to a creaky old Senator played by Douglas. Don't get me wrong, The Changeling is a non-stop thrill ride if you've never seen a ghost story before. Otherwise, you can predict the long-buried secrets in long-shuttered rooms as if there were signs on the door (and there may as well be). It's not badly made -- the director has mastered the fundamentals of horror, such like chases down long dark halls, and Scott's grief is entirely believable, since, well, he's George C. Scott, who can communicate a thousand tortured feelings just by standing alone on screen (had he done more of that, he might have had a better career -- difficult is the kindest adjective attached to him). So if you don't set your expectations too high, The Changeling is just moderately entertaining enough to satisfy.

I can't take away from its masterfully steady technical handling and established story-telling of an old house with a terrible secret, however never did I feel all that involved with the characters' stodgy plights (despite motivated rock solid performances by George C. Scott and Trish Van Devere) or encounter any sort of lasting chills in its drawn-out pacing. It's deliberately slow-burn with its old-fashion mystery pattern, where John Coquillon's sweepingly elegant cinematography becomes just as important as the suggestively melancholy story like an organising tool in orchestrating measured shocks and moody atmospherics with Rick Wilkins' silkily sullen music arrangement. Visually it held me there with Peter Medak's rhythmically polished direction, along with Scott's potent performance. However the story while serviceable, just takes too long to get to the point and lack that ominous sting and disorientating spells in what should be distressing build-ups with its strange occurrences, manifestations and revelations. Eventually I found it all to be emotionally hollow. The rest of the performances stack up fair with the likes of Melvyn Douglas, Jean Marsh and John Colicos. "},{"Title":"Decent but flawed","Date":"22 October 2006","Score":"","Genre":"Fantasy, Horror","Review":" THE CHANGELING &#150; Peter Medak While Hollywood produced horror films in the majority have been targeted towards the teenage / adolescent audience, there have been selected attempts to make horror films that would appeal to an older crowd as well. The salient feature of these films would be their distinctly older protagonists (sometimes big movie stars of an earlier era), a generally more substantial (or al dente, as the Italians might say) plot than your routine teenie slasher flick, reduced levels of gratuitous nudity and/or blood-spilling, and a reliance on building a steady atmosphere of suspense and dread before breaking out the visceral thrills. Examples of this include Hell House, The Exorcist, The Omen, or more recently, The Sixth Sense and Stir of Echoes. The Changeling, released in 1980, is another example of this 'mature' horror category.The film stars George C. Scott (Patton, Exorcist III Legion) as a composer, John Russell, who retires to a secluded town after the shock death of his wife and daughter in an accident. Intending to occupy himself with teaching and composing, Russell leases a sumptuous old house. Unfortunately for him the old house fulfills the horror tradition of having a troubled history and roofing the things that go 'bump' in the night. Disturbed enough by the phenomena to even hold a s√©ance, Russell finds its roots in the murder of a child that was heir to wealth and power and its substitution by another. Russell confronts the substitute, or the 'changeling' as he puts it, and consequences follow.While the film is photographed with elegance and Scott delivers a restrained and empathetic performance as a the grief-stricken composer, it has flaws that prevent its ascension to classic status. The first half of the film is a literal catalog of the clich√©s of haunted house stories doors opening and shutting by themselves, thudding noises in the attic, water pipes turned on automatically. It's hard to feel immersed in a story that confronts you with massive deja vu. While things improve somewhat with the turns the narrative takes, the film-makers also show their insecurity by clumsy insertion of scenes of freak death (like in The Omen, even cribbing the murderous tricycle scene using a wheelchair) and large-scale domestic destruction (a la The Amityville Horror), which stand wholly apart from the otherwise measured pace of the film. The climax comes across as especially egregious because, the way it plays out, it gives short shrift to the somewhat interesting moral compass of the changeling, whose death is brought passively by revenge from the beyond.To my view The Changeling has its roots in the M.R. James tradition and would fit more comfortably as a small-scale Twilight Zone drama. Its best moments are its quietest ones, where the characters grapple with their emotional state than with the overt manifestations of an inconsistently powerful supernatural force. The compromises made to pepper it with jaded jolt moments and big scenes dilute that focus and ultimately reduce its appeal. In the end it is a good-intentioned effort executed with polish but rarely an involving experience.

That orphan, that impostor, that profiteer of a heinous murder (George Scott quoted) eventually becomes a Republican senator - as all evil impostering orphans apparently do - while the true inheritor of the zillions, ghost Joe, festers in the house where he had been murdered, plotting quick revenge. Or? Well... not exactly. Joe the 6 year-old ghost - or let's just call him Casper - has been doing absolutely nothing for over 70 years in terms of avenging his own death. He is a typical patient Hollywood ghost, not really in a rush to achieve the tasks he'd given himself. (When you face eternity as a spook, I guess the concept of time achieves a whole new meaning.) It's only the arrival of a composer, for some bizarre/stupid reasons that are offered here, that triggers the blood-letting juices in Caspar. Why would Caspar need Scott's help - in anything? Why exactly does Caspar do nothing in the meantime? One would think that the first oder of business for a murdered-boy-turned-ghost would be to exact revenge by killing the actual murderer, i.e. his father, right? Wrong. Hollywood-movie ghosts just never get their priorities straight, they are just so very confused - much like the people who run Hollywood, and even more so those write scripts for its airhead bosses.Caspar's only wish is to kill the Republican senator who - through no fault of his own - took his place. Did he actually have much of a choice as to whom he is adopted by? Wouldn't YOU want to keep zillions if someone handed them to you? I love this left-wing self-righteousness... Liberals, of course as we all know, absolutely hate money, they detest and abhor its very existence. Besides, a Democratic senator would never ever fight to keep money that isn't his. I mean, really... The Democrat Party has zero corruption and no malicious evil-doers in their ranks whatsoever, unlike those evil evil Republicans and their unquenchable thirst for power, wealth and wars. Malicious bastards, the lot of them.The way the senator pulls his weight - his strings (to quote Bela Lugosi) - and the way he used his apparently inexhaustible supply of connections was very funny to watch. The way those paranoid left-wing Hollywood flicks portray politicians, one would think that a mere senator were powerful enough to rule the Galaxy. The senator has a LOT of friends, to quote a galactic being from Battlefield Earth...Not ever attempting to kill his father very simply means that Caspar Joe was merely jealous of his replacement and of the milk-and-honey-lifestyle the other boy/man had been leading for over 70 years. Yes, over 70 years. So what exactly prevented Caspar from killing both Caspar Senior AND New Caspar Junior all those years? That's one for the screenwriter of TC to answer.Certainly, Caspar, by murdering the police inspector in neutral territory (i.e. well outside his haunted-house perimeters), had shown that he can easily kill anyone, anywhere. He is keen to frighten innocent little girls, harass emotionally devastated composers, and certainly more than happy to bump off a cop at the slightest hint of corruption, but when it comes to the two people most directly involved/connected to his own bleak fate, he is useless, inactive, hopeless.Only at the end (of the politician's 56th term as U.S. senator) does he actually do something. Casper the Jealous Ghost.In spite of the usual gaping holes in logic that nearly always come with haunted-house-flick territory, this is a solid movie. However, not nearly as good as Legend of Hell House or The Haunting.

Great horror movies cause you to want to close your eyes, yet entice you to keep them open just the same. They are unfortunately rare.

More than that, The Changeling obviously inspired many of the modern horror movies, such as The Ring, The Grudge and the Skeleton Key.This film is basically about a young boy who's been murderer by his father due to the child's unbeatable disease, which made another boy a rich senator. The story runs kinda fast, the atmosphere isn't creepy or scary, just a little suspenseful at times, and in the last 20 minutes we have a big jump that was really unexpected. Other than that, the film is nothing but a regular mystery with a turning off ending..

Help me daddy, and he turns to see they're only playing, but he reacts as if something is wrong, like a good parent... that fear hinted at sets the tone for the rest of the film.Then we move with John Russell (George C Scott from Dr. Strangelove, The Exorcist III, and refused the Oscar for Patton) into a gorgeous house maintained by the historical society, equipped with it's own mini grand, what more could a composer want? The slow panning through the halls makes us reflect on the loss this man has endured already in the film, as he begins to write a new chapter.But this house has a secret and it will not rest. Something happened in this house in 1909 and though others have attempted to live in the house, it has remained empty since 1967, until now.Russel takes a job as a professor at the nearby university, hoping that getting back into teaching will help him get over a slight musical block he has been confronted with since the death of his wife and child.The film is rich with atmosphere, rosewood, classical depth, and slow pans, always looking askance, and a soundtrack that is hauntingly beautiful.The Changeling is a cinematic masterpiece, and the only other horror I know with as beautiful a soundtrack would be A Tale of Two Sisters, and The Ring JAP and USD, perhaps.I love when he's banging on the lock around the hidden door in the house, and the house starts banging back louder until he breaks the lock off. The banging of a boy, Joseph Carmichael who drowned by his father's own hand while bathing upstairs in his room.I did not find the move particularly scary, but a fascinating and well made period piece ghost story from the late 70s. The kind of house I would love to explore as a child. The story has depth, pacing, music, acting, dialog, everything lacking in horror movies these days, and in the last 10 years or more.The scene with the red and white rubber ball rolling down the staircase, which Russell then tosses off a bridge, bounces down the steps again to the haunting symphony soundtrack compelling, made me exclaim; THE BOUNCY BALL THAT WOULD NOT DIE!!!, which cracked everyone up, sorry couldn't help it.It is a child's presence, who is not at peace, and cannot rest. Movies like this don't use different dialog, but they use it perfectly, articulated poignantly, poetically, and never contrived or conflicted. Horror movies nowadays never get the simple dialog across well. I miss those days.The medium in the movie was really good too. That scene was nicely done, not scary but well done. Not over the top, another thing movies tend to have a problem avoiding.Another interesting thing I noticed about the house is there are no mirrors. But frames line the halls and walls, of various sizes, which are embroidered over and now hold light fixtures.The movie is a little long, but well rounded, with a fairly cool finale with a fiery spiral staircase to Hell! And I love the music box, as it opens and begins to play to the credits scrolling slowly up the screen... perfect.

After a little research, he realises the spirit could be that of a six year old boy murdered in the house seventy years earlier - a spirit who seems to have a message for his new houseguest.THE CHANGELING isn't as great a horror movie as many claim but it does have its moments and is generally a fine way to pass a Saturday night. Scott seems a little miscast in the title role and approaches his character with an unnecessary hostility but the other cast members do a commendable job, bringing a sense of realism to a wholly supernatural tale. Direction from Peter Medak is competent throughout and very typical of the late seventies era.Shocks are more intellectual than in-your-face - the very idea that some of the things are happening is scarier than their execution in the movie - and there's a lack of logic throughout which makes things hard to accept at times. If this house is so haunted and scares the living preverbials out of Scott, for example, why does he persist in living there? That said, it is a horror movie and reasonable thinking can't always be expected of characters in this genre.Overall, I would rate this on par with THE AMITYVILLE HORROR - another above average supernatural chiller - as a movie which doesn't quite live up to its full potential. It's certainly creepy and intense - just don't expect another EXORCIST.  *** / ***** "},{"Title":"an overrated horror classic","Date":"3 December 2002","Score":"1 out of 3 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Fantasy, Horror","Review":"     It is a shame that when one is looking around for great scary movies, there are so many misleading reviews.

Scott) rents out an old house to move on and continue his career. With help from Claire Norman, (Trish Van Devere) who represents an organization run by Sen. Joseph Carmichael, (Melvyn Douglas) that owns the house, he sets about refurbishing the house while working on his music. Suddenly tortured with a constant, never-ending barrage of noises and freak occurrences around the house, he takes it up with the members of the organization, he is convinced that a ghostly spectre haunts the house, but even after a Parapsychologist, (Barry Morse) finds nothing, he still isn't convinced. As he is prone to more attacks from the spirits, he finally learns the truth about the place and tries to right the wrong committed years ago.The Good News This one here only has a couple of good points to it that gives the film it's only good points. The beginning stages of the haunting here are incredibly well-done, using the time-tested method of using a genuinely creepy tactic, the constant banging of something loud and repetitious off in the distance at the weirdest moments and at great intervals to keep it from feeling really dull, at least during those moments. There's a lot of really great stuff through those scenes, and when it gets a really inventive sequence, there's some good parts to it. The infamous sequence where a ball, haven previously been discarded at a separate location returns back home to be thrown down the stairs from up the top in the darkness. It is then repeated seconds later with the person throwing it back up and it's immediately thrown back. It's a truly incredible scene that works wonders, being intensely chilling and highly creative as well being a creative and really sells the film on virtue of it alone. It's a classy scare in a classy film, and is really nerve-wracking. These sequences are the film's best, as they are really fun and are actually the best parts of the film. Even though the ending is fun in all it's fiery-blaze glory, and combined with the rather intriguing story, comprise the film's good points.The Bad News This one here has a couple of flaws that hold this one down. This is mainly due to the fact that this is really slow-going and doesn't have anything good to keep the pace going. There's almost nothing in here that makes the film feel any more watchable as it really does come along so slowly that it takes far too long for anything of value to happen, and those are just way too dull to keep the film going. Having to listen to the repeated talks of the victim forced into giving the same speech over and over again about how the proceedings have affected them or how the odd noises coming from the house aren't supposed to be there at all to everyone within ear-shot, and it eventually just gets old. That leaves major portions of the film feeling very dull and boring due to it's relentless use of these dialog-based scenes to move everything along that there's just an overall boring feeling for the whole film. That makes it too long for it's own good as well, over-reaching it's stay due to it's length of scenes that make the same point over and over. All these just stretch the film out to a longer point than it should be, and in the event make the film just way too long, which coupled with it's dearth of action scenes due to the incessant talking, give this one a really long feeling that just drags the film down as a whole. Otherwise, these here are the main problems with the film.The Final Verdict A really long and dull film, with a few moments of mention to give it something to shoot for, make this one a really moderate feeling. If that doesn't appeal to you, then probably heed caution with it, but if this sounds like the slow-burn that you happen to enjoy, give it a shot.Rated R Violence, Language and children in danger "},{"Title":"The atmopshere is perfect, it's a pity not much else is","Date":"9 September 2009","Score":"2 out of 6 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Fantasy, Horror","Review":" The Changeling isn't too unique and doesn't offer too much for the genre however what helps this forgotten 1980 horror stand out from the rest is the brilliantly executed atmosphere; unfortunately that is about it. The film opens with a slap-in-the-face scene that holds up well though the more the film progresses the more it becomes a bore to sit through and one can't help but predict the entire story (which in itself is weak) and notice to tiresome ghost story clich√©s. Yes it has some great scenes and some captivating execution here and there however the over-all result of the film doesn't really hold up as The Changeling succeeds in some accepts and then utterly fails at others.Perhaps it's the atmosphere that echoes classics like The Innocents and The Haunting that make this film highly acclaimed amongst the horror crowd; then again this may be blinding people from what else is going on. The movie involves John Russell (George C. Scott) who loses his wife and child in a car accident. He moves out of his small city apartment into a ridiculously huge house in the country. Once there he is terrorised by a spirit and the more he investigates the more the mystery unravels &#x96; sound familiar? Even in 1980 this story was already one giant predictable clich√©. The screenplay handles the ghost concept rather well and there are no stupid laughable moments or anything of the sort; until the last twenty minutes where doors begin to burst open, wind comes from nowhere, a little spontaneous combustion, shaking chandeliers and so on &#x96; this doesn't work and it makes the film seem pumped cheese, therefore weak and illogical &#x96; it sometimes relies in silliness to scare which I've never understood why so many horror films do that; The Changeling is no exception.The mystery surrounding the spirit is never emphasised or explained enough; the spirit doesn't seem to have a motive to haunt this particular man. It's like the director forgot to go into even brief detail about the ghost and that is another major element that the film lacked quality in. The story is unoriginal and typical, sometimes that is passable but The Changeling doesn't provide anything to excuse its neglected story. It's a disappointing film because the movie works itself up to be a logical ghost/haunted house tale with some nice backup stories but the final result turns out to be a typical mess riddled in sad clich√©s to the extent where the atmosphere, camera-work, acting and score can't redeem its silliness.The atmosphere is utterly terrific; although the mansion the story takes place in is too big it still works as there are some great cries, banging and moaning that echo through the house at night; throw in a bit of special camera-work (the tracking, the stills) given the well light sets and cinematography you know the director knew how to unsettle his audience &#x96; the film also features creepy antique wheelchairs and toys that work and fit into the script at the right moment but then unfortunately take a wrong turn and become unintentionally hilarious.The performances from the cast are fine and never really become too unbearable. This is great as so many horror films have acting that is never up to scratch however The Changeling is a film where one can sit back and relax to acting that isn't at all worthy of a cringed face, even if George C. Scott pulls some hilarious expressions at times.The score by Rick Wilkins is fantastic. The gorgeous orchestral music really fits with the traditional ghost/haunted house story and the director really knew when to use it so that it would be effective. See, when one takes in these parts of the movie you can see director Peter Medak had talent for a haunting and eerie horror; disappointingly enough the story and characters are utterly weak and that is where one can't help but notice the overall incompetence of what you just watched.So if you're sick of worthless predictable ghost stories with a typical story that doesn't work, too much unintentional humour and a bucket load of clich√©s that doesn't offer anything to the genre then The Changeling isn't really the film to watch; however, if you're in the mood for the run-of-the-mill ghost story where the atmosphere is actually done right then and the acting is bearable perhaps this is for you. Don't expect too much from The Changeling, it isn't really anything special and in all honesty the only element it has going for it is the atmosphere which is not enough to redeem the overflowing flaws. 5/10 "},{"Title":"Overpraised","Date":"17 July 1999","Score":"2 out of 6 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Fantasy, Horror","Review":"  This overlong, cliched horror film has been rather overpraised.

Starring George C. Scott and a compelling (if not original) tale, just grab a bowl of popcorn and enjoy this long, dark, atmospheric (if somewhat boring) flick. This production is far from what you would expect with a star of the caliber as George C. Scott. While his performance is nothing less than brilliant, the production itself simply does not deserve his presence.The story is decent, but solid and shaky at times. The dialog of the screen play was trite, stiff and at times even lame. However, Scott's performance can do a lot in the way of redemption, and as the story (finally) moves along the tension builds and you do get a few jumps from the effects at times. The effects themselves were adequate, but at the time in which this film was done, they could have been a lot more.I won't detail the plot, as I seldom feel the need to completely spoil a movie, except to say that this is a good ghost story with a better performance from Scott than the director (or the screenplay) deserved...And while the ending was quite dramatic, climactic, and well done, it (and Scott) were powerless to redeem this movie.Sadly, the ending promises a sequel...thankfully, it has never come.I'm being generous here with a 4.9/10 from...the Fiend .

Mad props out to HBO  for a nice DVD transfer with the slammin' audio mix. All in all it was good popcorn experience.  Even though the film is twenty years old it still managed to send a couple of chills down my spine.  However I must admit that some of the thrills have gone the way the film's costume design, they're both a bit dated.It's not so much the era that dates it as it is the style it was shot in. The cinematography and production design reminded me of an old episode of Columbo.  Both elements were relatively flat.  The fact that it was shot in the 80's is no excuse since a films like The Godfather was made in 1974 (some six years earlier) and Blade Runner was made in 1982 (only two years later) .  The Changeling was simply shot as if it were a television movie of the week.In all fairness it could have been due to relatively small budget, which IMDB list at 7.6 million in Canadian dollars.  Still,that's a healthy amount of dough, especially for the 80's.  TV production value just should not have been tolerated for this film and personally I had a hard time getting around it.  It distracted me.The irony of it all is that the director, Peter Medak, went on to do massive amounts of television including NBC's Homicide and Law & Order SVU, two of the most stylish shows to grace the airwaves.  In that respect, it's a testament to the director, who at age 63, hasn't stopped growing as an artist.  In a perfect world Medak would have a do over and create the masterpiece that he should have had twenty years ago with this film.There's no doubt in my mind that if the film had executed with a bit more form, as well as substance, it might have been considered one of the greatest films ever made.
