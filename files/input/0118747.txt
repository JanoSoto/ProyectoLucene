James Brown and Aretha Franklin reprise their guest roles. The music is not as good as the original but still better than most music in the charts these days.The humour from the original is here but it is not as funny as the original. In fact all elements from the original are here in slightly inferior forms, with the exception of the car chase, which is better.To be honest, it is worth seeing this film just to see how all the band has aged. i would recommend it to anyone who enjoys Blues music, though fans of the original may be disappointed "},{"Title":"Chill, Enjoy The Miusic And Laugh","Date":"26 February 2006","Score":"60 out of 90 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Comedy, Crime","Review":" Here's another film in which I totally go against the critics - both professional and on this board, who take themselves too seriously at times. They hated this sequel to The Blues Brothers, but I enjoyed it very much. They need to chill a bit and realize the purpose of this film simply a tribute to the music.How could any fan of blues, not like this? I mean, look at all the great performers in this film and how much better does it get to have all of them join in for a couple of jam sessions at the end? The movie sports a Who's Who of modern-day blues musicians and singers and also is directed by John Landis, who has directed some of the most entertaining films of the last 25 years.Plus, it was simply a funny movie with two funny guys - Dan Akyroyd and John Goodman - and a really neat-looking little kid in J. Evan Bonifant who really makes me laugh. Just looking at this 10-year-old dancing is his Blues Brothers outfit alone is worth a number of laughs. Some of the characters in here are so outrageous they would be tough to describe. The car chases, the dances and clothing and over-the-top story all add up to two hours of lamed-brained fun. No, this isn't Shakespeare and it wasn't mean to be. It's a much nicer-edged movie than the first Blues Brothers, too. Unfortunately, too many people want edgy material all the time .Not only are the characters colorful, so is the cinematography, making it both a visual and audio treat. So....just look at it as a blue concert with laughs, and, hopefully, you'll enjoy it.

It is supposed to be a tribute to the original. People who bash this movie without reading Aykroyd's interviews are ignorant to the intent here. This movie was originally to be a sequel back in 1981 just before Belushi died. When that happened, the idea for another adventure fell away. But after almost two decades, Aykroyd wanted to do something to revisit the classic film and pay homage to his friend and co-star Belushi, so he assembled this Concert Movie, which is supposed to be all about THE MUSIC, not the story. The only reason a story was put in was to keep it moving from musical number to musical number, because everyone knows that straight concert films are pretty boring, even if you really like the performer(s). So here it is, for the true Blues Brothers fans to enjoy. P.S.-And if your problem with the plot was some of the cartoony style actions that occur (Cabel being pulled heavenward and his clothes magically changing, et cetera), remember that the original had the same things. In the first one the entire band's clothing magically changes for a concert, but if you know that this is merely a representation of the character's psychological state and not a literal change, then the film works much better. The same idea works for the much-maligned zombie sequence near the end at Queen Mousette's mansion. Also, people complain about the Bluesmobile in this film being able to drive underwater. Well, in the first film the car flew, performed flips, and was nearly indestructible. In fact, if you watch the DVD of the first film, you find in the deleted scenes and Making-of section that the Bluesmobile is supposed to be magic, because it was parked each night inside a power transformer. How is that for cheesiness on the first film? So that also explains Elwood's ability to smuggle himself in the dash of the car in this one, and the car being able to crash land from a fiery loop-de-loop at the fairgrounds. Even though I wish this film could have been a little edgier and darker in tone like the original, I do find its bold and effective use of color to be magnificent and fascinating. Perhaps this film has a little more depth than people expect, so they incorrectly perceive it to be a lackluster and shallow mindnumbing entertainment. I know better .......

He looked more like Joe Friday than Elwood Blues.  His Chicago accent was forced, the dialog moved through at a horribly slow pace.  There was absolutely zero comic timing in this movie.  Every scene in the movie, including the musical numbers, took too long-from Elwood talking to the Penguin, to the Car chases-long shots of police cars-to the car-under-the-water routing-to the 50 car pile up that seemed to take 10 minutes.The musical numbers-the lifeblood of the original-were completely devoid of soul.  Aretha Franklin's lip-syncing in particular was horrible.  Matt Guitar Murphy looked more like a broken down old man than the body-builder he did in the original.  Who could believe that the `Dunn and Cropper' radio talk show could possibly exist when they both seemed to be reading off of cue cards the entire movie?The things that we funny and subtle in the first film-Elwood's parking ability, Jake's transformation at the hands of Reverend Cleophus, the miracle performance of the Bluesmobile, the new jobs of the former band members, were hackneyed and overdone in this film.The lack of energy from the band, though, is the coffin nail for this film.They perform with such little life that CGI animation of a skeleton riding a skeletal horse over the stage has to be imposed during their rendition of `Ghost Rider.'  This comes from the same Blues Brothers band that made the theme to Rawhide sound like a hit twenty years ago.Finally, the movie seems too bright and too clean.  The original took place at night for the most part, and seemed dungier.  This film is shiny and clean and that just doesn't feel right.  The new Bluesmobile didn't even look right until Elwood littered up the dashboard with trash, and-get this-the cigarette lighter worked!Other fatal flaws dumbing-down Elwood Blues, inserting a kid into the cast, having Elwood eat something other than dry, white toast, the shaving-cream-ball schtick, no SCMODS, no lines like `Man, I haven't been pulled over in six months.'

It was cool that they tied in the deaths of John Belushi and Cab Calloway into the movie's plot, making the characters they played dead as well.  If Jim Belushi took the part of Joliet Jake, that would have been a disaster. Still, the plot of this movie could have used some serious work. For instance, in the original movie, the Blues Brothers (a) were actually brothers and (b) were on an actual mission from God.  Their goal was to make some honest money to save an orphanage from shutting down, while trying to flee from the police at the same time.  The movie brought back blues legends such as Aretha Franklin and James Brown back into the spotlight, and it helped contribute to the death of disco. Eighteen years later, Jake's dead, Cab Calloway's dead, the orphanage has been shut down, so why are they being chased by the police?  Because a half brother of Elwood got p***ed off at finding his real past? The kid, I must add, was a nice touch, and it was cool to see twice as many blues legends in this movie, including some new artists like Johnny Lang and Erykah Badu.  But there should have been a better plot, because it seemed as though the Blues Brothers Band were going from event to event for the hell of it.  Where's the plot in that?  Police, leave these guys alone. The big mistake in this movie was its attempt to outdo the original movie. The music was great, and I highly recommend buying the soundtrack.

Not least, Aretha Franklin's appearance is truly funny, especially when you have seen the original movie.But the movie lacks the plot of the original. The original plot may have been thin, but it was enough to drive the story. This one lacks that, there is no motivation, no goal to speak of, and the result is that the ending comes as a surprise. Was that it, was that the end of the movie? Then what? But when I saw it the second time, I was prepared and enjoyed the music instead.Another weakness is the lack of special effects. The original movie made a big thing of overdoing car chases in very funny ways. This movie rather under-does them. In the time it was made, it should have used computer graphics to do plenty more than the original. Now they smash a few cars, but little remarkable happens. In particular, there are no original ideas in the car chases.So don't expect too much, just enjoy the music and the fun parts (they sure exist). And don't get bothered by Buster.

I just recently rewatched the movie, and I feel just stupid for doing so. The movie is even worse the second time around. There are no redeeming qualities, or performances, to save the movie, which has a dumbass plot, and is just boring to watch. The whole 'feud' with the russians is like what a 2 year old would do, and shows early on what a disaster the movie is. The ending is pointless, driving off into the horizon with the cops chasing. Seems like no one knew how to end the movie so they went the brainless way out, at least the first movie showed what happens when you fool with the cops, you become the prison band, which made the end of the original excellent. The only thing they could have worked is have James take over John's role, because the explanation of Jake's death is soooo stupid it's insulting. In the trivia to this movie, it says the movie was ranked 4th, out of 25, worst sequels, I would like to know what was worse than this? I would have said it IS the worst.

If you take it on its own merits, it's just appalling.The blatant token inclusion of a black actor (part of the innate fun of the REAL Blues Brothers was the fact that they were both uncool white guys), the addition of the kid to add cutesy appeal (wherefore cutesy appeal from a BLUES band?) and the moronic subplot with the militia and the Russian mafia (Illinois Nazis I buy. THIS I do not) are only a partial list of the offenses committed by this steaming pile of cinematic excrement.The extensive use of the impossible (Ghost Riders in the sky, zombifying people, transformations into rats) made this seem like a nasty parody of the original film, which, while it did take a few short detours into the realm of 'no way' (the backwards car flip), generally confined its antics to the at-least-theoretically-possible realm. That allowed the viewer to suspend their disbelief enough to either allow for these crossovers or at least snicker at their impossibility and accept it as part of the Blues' Brothers charmed quest. Here, it makes a bad thing worse. And then Paul Shaffer comes slouching in. He DOES belong in the movie (most of the Blues Brothers albums feature him on keyboard, not Murphy Dunne), but his over-the-top performance makes him seem like the Frenchmen in Monty Python and the Holy Grail.

Still, The Blues Brothers wasn't the perfect movie to be made. It was a nightmare for Universal Pictures, to complete. It was wildly off schedule, had an ever-changing script, drug-fuel stars and was way over budget. Yet, the movie made, nearly triple of its money back, when it was released. The reasons why it work, was because the movie was action packed, kinda funny, and had great musical numbers. Still, most of its success, came from its two top drawings stars, Dan Akroyd and John Belushi. This sequel, didn't have any of those achievements. It's felt like a desperate retread between writer/actor Dan Akyroyd and writer/director John Landis to relive the glory days. The sequel fails to live up to the original, big time. The reasons why, are very clear. First off, the movie plot is paper thin. The movie tells the story of Elwood Blue (Dan Aykroyd) trying to reunited the old band to fight in a battle of the band contest in Louisiana. In my opinion, this plot is very weak, compare to the Mission from God, from the first movie. The movie never establish, why Elwood need the band, in the first place, or why the other band members would come to his rescue, when they, themselves are living, pretty well-off. Second off, the movie kinda ruins the first film, by stating out that the orphanage that the brothers were trying to save, ended up, closing. It kinda a bummer opening to a film. The Studio didn't like this, and force John Landis to make the rest of the film, more light-hearted. It gets worst, as the film turns PG to capitalize on a wider audience. It really limits the amount of violent and language, that they can show. This makes for a very underwhelming film. It was really boring for the most part. The jokes are very childish and cartoony. I really couldn't get into the whole, over the top supernatural sequence, this movie, brings. It felt like a 10 year old, wrote this film. I really didn't like the fact, that Elwood was being team up with a kid named Buster (J. Evan Bonifant). Not once, in the film does Elwood seem like he has any father-like connection with the kid. The movie acts as if the kid wasn't there, for the most part. It was very pointless. Even new members, like Mack (John Goodman) were underwhelming. The movie never does a good job, in making it seem, like Elwood and Mack have somewhat a connection. The chemistry, between them isn't there. It's sad, because I love John Goodman as an actor. John Landis and Dan Aykroyd were reportedly very unhappy with the changes the studio forced onto the film, even coming close to quitting the project. Third off, I can't believe, they made a sequel, 18 years after the 1980's hit, Blues Brothers. John Landis really waited too long to get this sequel, off the ground. Nobody really wanted to see this film, in the late 1990s. Why is this movie, even made!? It's not like, the fan-base were asking for a Blues Brothers sequel. If, they were; clearly the producers should had quickly capitalize on it, in the early 1980s. Maybe, they did, wanted to make a film sequel as quick as possible, but production of the film was halted, due to main actor, John Belushi's odd drug behavior. Maybe, they were waiting for Belushi to go into rehab. Well, that day never came, as John Belushi died in 1982. Since Belushi couldn't reprise his role, I don't understand, why this movie wasn't shelf. Clearly, they can't use a double for Jake. Nobody can double Belushi. The death was actually worked into the film's plot; it didn't really help, but it was at least respectful to John Belushi. The film was originally intended to include Brother Zee Blues (Jim Belushi, brother of John Belushi). But due to an already existing television deal, Jim Belushi was unable to appear and the script was altered to include Cab Blues (Joe Morton). This was a huge mistake as Joe Morton, really didn't give us, much in humor. He's a good actor, but he's no comedian. The movie has a lot of cameos by celebs. Aretha Franklin, B.B King, James Brown, Frank Oz and few others return from the first movie, for a small paycheck and reprise some of their classic hits. One person from the first movie that didn't return was Cab Calloway & John Candy, who died four years prior to the film's release. Still, the movie does give them, some homage. I like that new musicians at the time, like Blues Travelers & Erykah Badu, gives the movie, so needed new flair. It made the film, somewhat entertaining. The music is pretty damn good for the most part, but the movie doesn't mixed, the musical sequences so well, with the rest of the film. Overall This movie is one of most pointless, underwhelming, and just downright bizarre sequels in comedy history. It wasn't good, man. I don't recommended.

It's as if 'Disney' took over the production, put a cute kid in it, and turned it into a jolly piece of family entertainment. For example, in the original the car chase was on the mean dirty streets of Chicago, with all the rubbish and shadows that come with a city location. But in the sequal the car chase was staged on a nice piece of quiet country road, with green grass and lovely scenery. It seems the filmmakers decided to take it easy with this one and do all their work in the most comfortable of surroundings. Why block city streets when you can take your time out in the middle of nowhere? While that may sound convenient in the end the original car chase was much more exciting, real and funny than the newer version.Even the prison that Ellwood is released from at the beginning of the film is in a nice piece of verdant countryside. I thought Jolliet was deep in the heart of Chicago, in a kind of industrial wasteland... Aretha Franklin and her crew are all now rich and selling expensive cars! Oh dear, whatever happened to the 'blues'? Blues music plays so much better in more rundown areas. Well that's what I think.Certainly the music is awesome and I cannot help feel that they should have all just gone on the road rather than make this ineffectual and silly sequal. There were just to many characters, not nearly enough story, and Ellwood seemed to talk non-stop to the point of being annoying. Ackroyd's voice even sounded cartoon-like, he definately didn't sound the Ellwood from the original.I have seen the original more times than I can count, and could happily sit down and watch it now, but the sequal I have seen maybe two and a half times and have no wish to sit through it again.

At least they payed John the respect he deserved, and Ellwood tells him that Jake died paying some respect to John Belushi and his character, Jake Blues.Where they got the idea for a child to join the band is beyond me. Is this a guarantee PG-13 or what? Obviously they decided to make this at least a PG-13, and I think that is stupid. The original film was R, and sticking to it they should have done the same here. I like when there are family films, but this film is not! There is a strip bar sequence, and yet this is PG-13? Come on! As for these scenes, they paid absolutely nothing worthwhile to the film, other than filling in 20 minutes of stupid cheap gimmicks (Ellwood gets on stage and sings blues as the strippers come out) This is so dumb, and while the original had obvious dumb sequences, they came out funny-dumb, this film did not. It almost was not intended to be a real film, rather a joining of Akyroyd with Blues. They do not really care about the film itself. It's like a music video gone wrong. You'd expect to pick this video up and have a music CD pop out instead of a film.How anyone could think up such a lame excuse of a sequel is beyond me, and how Dan Akyroyd would ever join the cast again just completely mind boggling to me. What was Dan thinking?Overall this film pays some respects to John Belushi's SNL and film legacy, but overall does more damage to him than honor. I am disgusted that Dan would do this to such a classic film, and such a classic comedian. John Belushi wasn't a favorite of mine, but he was pretty funny, and very controversial for the time. I think if he were around today he would've lost his career like Dan, Chevy, Steve, and Bill. Not that these hilarious guys don't do funny films anymore, but they don't do ENOUGH films, anymore (especially Chevy, he has the most wasted career out of all)So if you like cheap gimmicks and rip-offs of the first Blues Brothers film, by all means see Blues Brothers 2000. But if you're like me and hate cheap gimmicks and unhonorable rip-offs, then stay clear of this flop. 1/5 stars-JOHN ULMER "}{"Title":"Aside from everything...","Date":"10 April 2007","Score":"8 out of 14 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Comedy, Crime","Review":" Aside from everything, like Dan Aykroyd's dwindling ability to write a compelling story with good dialog, the ridiculous say whaaa parts, and Elwood's complete change in character, what grinds my gears the very most, is the poster, it was advertised Aykroyd, Goodman They're back in blue completely disregarding the existence of the great John Belushi.....plus the movie sucked major balls if not for the music, and the kid's dance skills, i couldn't watch it....so very sad, and unfair!OHHH SCHNICKELFRITZ!

It didn't really try at all to stand on its own merits, it just came across as an excuse for the cast (most of whom were in the original) to relive the good ole' days. Most of the scenes and plot points mirrored those of the original film. Aside from that, the signature clothing (black suit, black fedora, sunglasses, etc.) and the Bluesmobile, this movie is almost unrecognizable from the original film.Out of the two stars of the original, only Dan Aykroyd survived to make this film. (RIP John Belushi.) Unfortunately, Elwood Blues must have gone to the grave with Jake Blues, because Dan Aykroyd's reprisal of his role is disgraceful. Elwood's voice, accent, mannerisms, and overall attitude have totally changed...for the worse. A once mysterious, serious, resourceful, and charming character has been warped into a worthless goofball, and this change sets the tone for the rest of the movie as well.The original movie, though very funny, had a serious tone to it (at least the performances seemed that way), but Blues Brothers 2000 is just goofy and cheesy. The only thing that I can compare the goofiness/cheesiness to is a kids movie...which makes sense since one of the main characters of this movie IS a kid, Buster Blues. After visiting The Penguin from the original movie, Elwood gets stuck mentoring an orphan boy, Buster, who turns out to be a blues prodigy. Add John Goodman's equally goofy character, Mighty Mack McTeer, into the mix and you've got a recipe for disaster.The only things that saves this movie from being a 0/10 are the outstanding musical sequences (with the exception of Johnny Lang's contribution). With the exception of John Belushi, the original band is reunited in this film and they do not disappoint! The Blues Brothers Band and the various cameos from famous musicians throughout the movie are reason enough to watch it. The final sequence, a Battle of the Bands contest, is particularly good.To Summarize the movie sucks, but the music is great! Watch it at least once, especially if you've seen the original.

There is an uncanny stench of desperation from the screen as the obligatory sequel plot takes fold and sadly consumes the iconic trail the original 1980's classic paved.I recall my original review of The Blues Brothers with dread upon viewing its unnecessary sequel. I stated, there are two car chases that could very well rank in some of the best ever executed in film. Police cars topple each other, one after another, and the film knows when to start and when to end them, and conclude with, The Blues Brothers is a fun, energized comedy that starts fast and rarely lets up in terms of comedy and music. It's a Chicago classic and one of the funniest and smartest musical comedies I have yet to see. The sequel takes all the fun out of its formula and replaces it with wasted energy. There's nothing here that couldn't have been simply put on a soundtrack and left at that.Dan Aykroyd reprises his role as Elwood, as he tries so hard to make new friendships, one of which involving a ten year old orphan named Buster (J. Evan Bonifant), who he takes along upon learning of his rather somber roots at the orphanage Jake and Elwood were raised in and saved from being demolished in the original film. He learns that Buster has a talent for playing the harmonica and gives him a slick suit and shades to join in the revival band. Elwood also recruits Mack McTeer (played by John Goodman), a bartender from a new strip club he has just found out about, and Cab (Joe Morton), the illegitimate son of an old friend who is initially bitter and cold towards the idea of a band but soon can not refuse.One of the strongest moments is the three minute long musical rendition of Wilson Pickett's 634-5789, about a phone number, when dialed, will connect the lonely caller to attractive women who will provide them with a good time. If only they saw who was really working the phone lines. For every infectious dance sequence we get, we get an endless amount of stale comedy littered with unimpressive jokes and redundant banter. The musical numbers are the saving grace here but, again, that's what soundtracks are for.It's hard to say exactly where Blues Brothers 2000 goes wrong. It seems to have all the working components for a sequel to the original film. It is written by Aykroyd himself and John Landis (who again assumes the director role), two men who should know the material better than any soul, and we can see they desperately tried to work around the deaths of co-workers John Belushi, Cab Calloway, and John Candy in order to make a sequel work, and John Goodman seems as good as anyone to proudly boast the suit and glasses, yet the pieces do not fit like they're supposed to. This is more of a tribute film rather than a direct sequel.I'll end this on a rather loose comparison; if the original Blues Brothers film was Hall and Oates, then Blues Brothers 2000 is the Hall and Oates cover band that's biggest gig is open mic night down at the town pub. They may not be too painful, but hell, it just ain't the real thing.Starring Dan Aykroyd, John Goodman, J. Evan Bonifant, Joe Morton, James Brown, Aretha Franklin, B. B. King.

Bonifant's is fine as a stray kid (pity he can't play the harmonica as well as shown) and Goodman makes easily up for Belushi's absence(John, rest in peace). Nia Peeples, although miscast as a cop, is a cute addition and her final dance number (who wouldn't dance to this tune?) is neat.I am sure Dan and John made this film more as a way to put the music out, than as a film.

There have been some reviews that point out the fact that this movie needs to be appreciated as a tribute to the original, but we should not have to read interviews with cast members and directors etc before we can appreciate and enjoy a film.  A bad film is a bad film.  The beauty of the art form of film is that its immediate and has no need for explanation.I think the reason that there has been so much spleen vented in relation to this appalling film is that the original movie was so fantastic that to see a pale imitation/sequel/tribute was just gut wrenching to us followers of the original Blues Brothers as a cult film.  Friends of mine can recite each and every word from the original and whilst yes that is sad it does perhaps explain why the lowest scoring votes for this film seem to come from the age group that was probably most affected by the original.Whilst we see some good ad-lib moments from Aykroyd the rest of the cast, the writers and director just miss the dead-pan reaction that Jake and Elwood gave us to the events in the first film. That was the essence of the original - Jake gets flamed and we see him smoke his cigarette,  they get out of the car it falls apart but no words are spoken just a look and then they are off, the car jumps over the bridge the cars got a lot of pickup, etc etc. The original film is a musical action comedy fantasy - something that should never have worked and I do not think has worked since - especially in this film.The great thing about this film of course is the music and that was a big part of the original with the blues brother soundtrack being a massive international seller.  In this film we see the most amazing bunch of real blues and soul musos ever assembled and perhaps the film could have been saved if they had been able to play a few more sets.2 out of 10.

That particular film has something of the emperor's new clothes in England, where the reputation John Belushi built up on Saturday Night Live is unknown. Similarly, Dan Aykroyd is the slightly overweight one from Ghostbusters over here, and nothing else. Yet an unspoken, university-insisted cool tells the nation's 20-30 somethings that they must love the film, and so they dutifully do. Personally it always struck me as being like the overlong movie of a film student. The direction was good, the music was excellent, and it was nice to see Steven Williams as a psycho cop, but other than that it was so-so entertainment. For many people the difference between the two Blues Brothers films is that of a classic being followed by a turkey. For me it's just the difference between a 6 and a 3.For if The Blues Brothers is indulgent, then Blues Brothers 2000 is the nearest I've ever seen to celluloid masturbation. Tacky, crass, stupid and irritating, I write this with a near-migraine as the sheer inanity of the whole venture has given me a severe headache.It starts well enough, with a dedication to deceased original stars Belushi, Cab Calloway and John Candy (what's that spinning sound I can hear?) and a touching scene where Elwood (Aykroyd) learns of his brother's death. Soon enough, though, Elwood has assembled a new Blues Brothers singing line-up. The lead is Mighty Mack McTeer (John Goodman). Say what you like about Goodman, he may or may not be many things (like, for example, funny) but I doubt even his own mother would argue that he's cool. Adding to the line-up is J. Evan Bonifant as the 10-year-old orphan Buster who Elwood takes under his wing. Awwwwwwwww! Ain't that sweet? A loveable situation ripe for touching heart to heart moments like those that made up the original. Oh, the original wasn't like that? Oh well, it'll help get a family audience, leave it in. The role was originally to go to MacCauley Caulkin, Bonifant managing the not inconsiderable feat of being even more annoying. A precocious brat, whose only purpose in the movie seems to be to induce vomiting, he makes Mickey Mouse look like a hard case with a nasty edge. In fact, so mind-numbingly dull is this trio that CGIed skeleton horses dance over the screen during Ghost Riders in the Sky in an attempt to keep you awake. I really am not making that up.But I digress. Making it a foursome is the bloke who invented Cyberdyne in Terminator 2 and he's actually not that bad for a token black member of the band. You can see him at the oven controls of this movie's production, desperately trying to heat it up, the others holding him back, saying No, leave it Joe, we like this pile of festering horse dung to be half-baked. Whereas the original had faintly amusing send-ups of the stars involved, this one not only has the problem of housing over three times as many musicians in the plot, but also their appearance. This time the cameos are no longer amusing, merely self-congratulatory and turgid. Aretha Franklin, sadly, appears to have lost some of her vocal skills and isn't as strong as she was in the original. Though it is worth watching just to see Wilson Pickett sing Eddie Floyd off the screen.Maybe the real problem is the music. The first specialised in jazz and soul, this one is pure blues. Not even a John Lee Hooker type blues, but a meandering, back-slapping jam of blues, which goes on and on for hours. Like the film, the music elements drag, and a great deal of the cameos would be unknown to a wider audience. Giving the Brothers' backing band more lines and character was also a mistake.The conclusion features a 130-year-old witch who transforms the three adult Blues into bright green dancing zombies. (I promise, I'm not making this up, really!) She also flies, makes instruments appear out of thin air and turns men into rats.Please, please, please - make it stop!!!

And when I rented it on video, I couldn't stand to watch it. The plot is really rather ridiculous, especially towards the end. The casting also hurts the movie. Belushi-dead, Cab Calloway-dead, John Candy-dead, Aykroyd-a shell of his former self, The Blues Brothers Band-did we HAVE to see these guys almost 20 years later? Yikes. It's not the producer's fault for what happened to everyone, that's the facts of life. But making a sequel when what made the original great has gone is idiocy. So you end up with a very hard to like movie. Die hard Blues Brothers fans like myself will consider it blasphemy; casual moviegoers will think it's just plain dumb.

The list gets even smaller for sequels that topped the original. Now Blues Brothers 2000 is horribly bad, even for a sequel. It does serve as a good example of doing a sequel by numbers. First, it needs to have everything that made the original famous. Let's see, huge car chase, check. A great band that can't get a gig, check. Lots of ticked off people in pursuit of the band, check. Second requirement, the sequel's plot must only deviate slightly from the original. The film succeeds here admirably with most of the best remembered jokes and character traits of the original repeated in ever so slightly modified form. Like most sequels, this movie has no artistic merit whatsoever. It is strictly a cash-in only affair. John Landis hasn't had a success for some time and Dan Aykroyd hasn't had more than supporting roles for a while either. What they've done here however is production line fodder which, ironically for a movie about a blues band, has no soul in it at all.Obviously this movie doesn't have John Belushi in it which means that one thing that made the first movie great, the interplay between him and Dan Aykroyd is missing here. Now I have a soft spot for John Goodman but it just doesn't work here. At least John Landis and Aykroyd didn't replace John with Jim Belushi, perish the thought. But then they decided to add two additional Blues Brothers, a police officer who during the movie discovers the blues and most annoyingly an 11 year old Blues Brother kid. Someone must have looked at the Sitcom 101 manual and found in chapter 1, entitled Kids are cute the instruction that kids who do adult things are always cute and bring laughs. Well, just like in sitcoms, this turns out to be truly stomach turning.The really sad thing about this movie is that it hammered home how far in front Hollywood puts making money instead of making great movies.

If you go into this movie expecting a huge sequel, you will be disappointed. I wasn't expecting a huge sequel. I was expecting exactly what I got. A fun movie. I liked the music, not as much as the original, but it was still fun music. High action and a lot of funny scenes that I rewound several times to watch again. Lots of guest stars you have to pay close mind to and I caught myself remembering each older band member as they were back in the 80's. Thinner, less or no grey hair and more involved with the movie instead of just being The Band. They tried to relive scenes from the original that, although not done well, I saw what they did there. The acting is on par with this kind of movie. I didn't expect Brando or anything like that. I expected exactly what was delivered. And to read that Akroyd & Landis were forced to make the movie in a way that did not suit them, only the execs, tells me that although the movie could have been better, their hands were tied & they did the absolute best they could.I gave the movie a 8 out of 10 stars. Subtract one star because you don't know what happened to Jake. Although really not important to the movie plot, it would be nice to know.Subtract one more star, for general purpose.

But I do think that the songs were almost all good (364-5789; John the Revalator; I'm Looking for a Fox; Funky Nassau, etc.) It is also a treat to see all the old band members reprise their old roles and to see them in old age. Dan Ackroyd does a good job acting and even improves upon himself, character-wise and acting-wise, in this sequel as compared to the original. John Goodman plays the part of a kinder person than John Belushi's old character. (In fact, I also would not think it heresy to think that John Belushi's character did not contribute that much to the original in the first place. He just was there to say cheap things like Fix the cigarette lighter, Hit it!, You motorhead! No f---ing way!, etc. Elwood was the one who was coming up with ideas on how to keep the Blues Brothers afloat. The viewer of the original movie should not underestimate the degree to which the good music and good screenplay in the original movie is causing him to think The Blues Brothers to be a great movie and not a mere good movie.) Buster may be a trouble-maker, but he is a spirited kid in the movie. Just like the original, the film catches the viewer's attention with the change in scenery. The film, to a slight degree, becomes a little corny with the White Supremacy and Russian gangsters bits, but that only remains a minor part of the film. The film was funny; Elwood's 'shaving cream scene' was hysterical. The Louisiana gig scene at the end was also exciting. The ending scene of the movie was admittedly anti-climactic. However, I do not hesitate in giving this movie a thumbs-up. After all, the film does not drag; it is not boring because it is more fast-paced than most motion pictures.CONCLUDING MESSAGE - No one should feel ashamed to try watching a movie, even if it does have bad reviews. I will personally opine that there is nothing wrong with liking or loving a movie that most people tend to dislike or hate.

Goodman replacing Belushi - there's your problem. (I like Goodman in anything else.) If you really watch the film, Elwood finding & perusing Cab was cool. What needed to happen is little Buster, played by J. Evan Bonifant, needed a better relationship/bonding story with Elwood. (Then the part of Jake being gone would have smoothed out easier.) I always said when Buster breaks out the harmonica (it's out of nowhere) - Elwood should have given him a harp before. Like This is the first cool thing my brother (or Curtis) gave me, etc. Then we would assume he started practicing & was a natural. Again, that could have bonded them together. J. Evan Bonifant won me over with his dance moves during Respect. He shows a lot of talent in the film and it could have made the film better.I'm told about 3 hours of film was on the cutting room floor, and that could have happened somewhat.

Sure, the humor may still be there. Maybe even a little bit of the charm. But it's just nothing compared to the original, and it does lose a lot in translation.It's too much of a re-telling of the original film, to the point that the label of sequel is an almost inaccurate term to describe it. It's startlingly close to venturing into remake territory. That being said, it's not without its strengths, and I do feel it's nowhere near the abomination and train-wreck that many make it out to be.John Landis returns to direct this sequel, in addition to co-writing the script with star Dan Aykroyd. To make up for the absence of John Belushi and Cab Calloway, several newcomers are added to the film, including John Goodman, Joe Morton and J. Evan Bonifant.18 years after the original film, Elwood Blues (Aykroyd) is finally released from prison, only to discover that his brother Jake and mentor/father-figure Curtis have both passed away. Seeking guidance, Elwood becomes a mentor to Buster (Bonifant), a 10-year-old boy, and seeks out Curtis' illegitimate son Cabel Chamberlain (Morton), whom doesn't take well to the news that his true father was a man his mother had an affair with. After re-uniting with his former drummer, meeting a talented singer named Mack McTeer (Goodman) and running afoul of Russian gangsters, Elwood and the gang decide to re-unite their band to perform again.The film, to its credit, does have a number of strengths.The performances are a lot of fun. Aykroyd does come off as a slightly different character in this film, but I was able to go with it, as Elwood is 18 years older and contending with a different part of his life, dealing with loss and new beginnings. Goodman steals the show, though. His character Mighty Mack is arguably a surrogate and replacement for the late John Bellushi, but Goodman makes the role his own and has a lot of fun making the character different... someone who is not born a Blues Brother, but adopts the persona. Bonifant is a talented child-actor, and he does his best, but the role of Buster is a bit on the poorly-written side, and it feels like too much of a jumping- the-shark gimmick to add a child to the mix. But he does a good job. And Joe Morton is great as Cabel Cab Chamberlain, who is in pursuit of Elwood for much of the film, but may end up joining him under the right circumstances.The music is also fantastic. Much like the original film, the plethora of song-and-dance numbers are perfect, and all feature good, old- fashioned choreography and imagery. They are the one part of the film that easily lived up to the original, if not slightly exceeded it.And beyond that, many of the jokes do work, particularly an uproariously funny recall of the car pileup sequence from the original movie that plays like a deranged cartoon.Those things being said, this is not a good film. It has just as many flaws as strengths, and due to the high quality of the original masterpiece, those weaknesses do stand out even more.As mentioned above, I view the main problem of the film as its insistence to feel less like a sequel and more like a remake. I felt that too much of the film was devoted to references, callbacks, and even entire scenes lifted almost directly from the original. There are moments where this can work (the opening scene outside of the prison, the car-pileup, etc.) in more subtle ways or in ways that cause the film to do the opposite of the original. But this movie doesn't do that. This movie simply tries to constantly point out how similar it is to the first film, no matter how contrived or bizarre it may feel as a result. And when the film just isn't as well put together (as is in the case with this film's script), it makes it seem a lot worse than it is.It also has a wide array of smaller issues with the tone, style and writing beyond the above issue. It feels far more sanitized stylistically, both due to the lower PG-13 rating and just because I believe Aykroyd and Landis were different people when they made this film. It's too... clean. Especially with the addition of a child- actor, which felt like too much of an attempt to soften the material and appeal to the family crowds that the prior film clearly wasn't going for. I also found that many scenes felt jarringly out of place or cartoonish. Even though the first film had a lot of religious imagery and toyed with things like breaking the laws of physics and the whole mission from God... In this film, all of the more over-the-top ideas feel more random and it doesn't gel as well. (Including a bizarre scene where, without spoiling anything, a character appears to lifted from a church and transformed by heavenly light, or another scene in which a Voodoo Priestess exhibits various supernatural powers) It doesn't quite work.Those complaints being said, the music is fantastic and the acting is a lot of fun for the most part. And I do think this is a fundamentally entertaining film (albeit also fundamentally flawed) for those reasons, and nowhere near the atrocity some have made it out to be. Blues Brothers 2000 gets an average 5-out-of-10 for me. See it for the music and try to ignore the rest.

Especially the music is once again amazing and it's nice to see John Goodman singing that awesome. To be honest with you Maybe the score was even better than the Blues Brothers one. Otherwise, the story was so-so. It feels like you've already seen it. And this isn't even a feeling, it's the truth, as the plot is nearly the same as the original one. Again, the film starts with the release out of prison, again the band will be renewed and then will drive through the country to the one and final big gig. It seems like John Belushi is replaced by John Goodman, Cab Calloway by John Morton, and the Nazis by the Russians. The only missing part is the huge chase with the police, which was easily the best moment of Blues Brothers. But don't get me wrong, the story is still great. But it's just a copy from the original one without the great characters of John Belushi or Cab Calloway.Overall the film is average, but the music is so good that it's not as important as usual.

This is just lacking a certain something. It does have things that are new to the series, but are they positive, and/or do they fit? I realize that Landis does fantasy sometimes, and, hey, I'm not saying that can't be great, it's not a genre I'm into, but I have enjoyed an effort or more within it, and it can be done well and right, as I would say all forms of expression can. With that said... did he feel it fit, here? The first may have had elements, but they were so toned down and could be rationalized away by those of us not big on that. Also, the original had a point. What were they headed for, here, where were they going? The modernization and overdoing didn't help any, and this time, everything seems possible and at the fingertips of the leads. There's not a trace of a sense of danger. Finally, the kid... honestly, he's not bad. No, I mean that. One would think that would be the fatal blow, but save for the very end, he's seldom-to-never irritating(to me, anyway). An instantly obvious, and well-known, shortcoming, here, is of course Belushi(R.I.P.). Him not being there is acknowledged, but where does the line go? Surely before so many in the cast have had condoling the loss be one of their first pieces of dialog that the viewer can't help but wonder why they made this in the first place. In fact, why did they? Elwood can't carry this on his own, he was part of a duo. It's not that I have a problem with Aykroyd. Not even a little, I admire him elsewhere. He just doesn't have the other person here, to spar with, to play off of. He also seems to have forgotten how to write and play the character(heck, that last one goes for the whole bunch, at least to a degree), with the result that he's turned into a parody of himself. The pacing is surprisingly tolerable. This is partially a remake, with one scene after the other that mimic the '80 one, if the order isn't the same. They didn't feel sorted, this time, or carefully arranged, but instead merely thrown together, as to avoid messing up the formula. The same goes for the song choices... I'd guess they went with what they wanted, rather than what actually fit. I didn't care for the pieces as much, but to each his own(and they do put some new styles in this). The direction isn't bad as such, it's just not engaging. The car-chases really took a nosedive. Where they were detailed and downright operatic in the one preceding this, they seem decidedly uninspired here. One bit, they seemed content with simply tossing the vehicles into the view of the camera, over and over, with the sophistication only equalled by a young bully kicking down a sand-castle. This in general wasn't fun, or funny, in my opinion. It is absolutely tasteless at one point. It gets too far out, slapstick and cartoonish. It boils down to that this seems like a largely aimless, if finely edited and shot, long music video. So, did they mainly want to put something that could be described as that up on the silver screen? If so, hey, good for them, they succeeded. This also stooped to the level of gratuitous sexuality, if no nudity, in more than one sequence. It contains some language, fairly harsh. The DVD holds a theatrical trailer, production photos and notes, posters and a making of. I recommend this to... fans of the tunes, I suppose.

Of course you do. Who doesn't love those Blues Brothers and their musical mayhem induced misadventures? This movie is nothing more than an attempt to try and follow up to the original - and it fails.John Landis returns to direct even though some say that his directing career sort of went downhill in the late 80's (specifically some say it was after the accident that killed Vic Morrow and those kids during the filming of Twilight Zone The Movie) and onto the 90's (although Oscar with Sly Stallone was moderately good - heck Siskel and Ebert both gave it a thumbs-up).Dan Akyroyd returns as writer and star of this movie as Elwood Blues, at the beginning of this movie Elwood is just getting out of prison when he receives news from the Penguin (no, not the Batman villain, the nun from the first movie) that his partner Jake Blues has unfortunately passed away. This is never explained in the movie at all even though in the opening credits it says it is dedicated to the memory of John Belushi as well as to John Candy and Cab Calloway, who also passed away before this movie got made.So Elwood tries to get the rest of the old band together, minus Jake of course. Along the way we meet the new guys First of which is Mighty Mack played by John Goodman. (Come on Goodman, you're far too good to be in a movie like this).We also meet our Tagalong Kid character who goes by the name Buster.We also meet Cabby who is reluctant to join until he receives a message from above and is instantly transformed into a Blues Brothers band member. The light shines down on him and he seems to be floating for some reason. I'd hate to steal a joke from Film Brain, but.....SYMBOLISM! Next we have some of the zaniest and messed up car chase scenes ever- the chase scenes in the original were truly spectacular but here they're just completely cartoonish. Such as the Bluesmobile being able to go underwater.We get it, the Bluesmobile is an awesome car - it can survive anything. This is completely and utterly insane even by this logic. What? Is it it like Linkara's magic gun or something? Is it possessed ala Christine? After all that nonsense we get to see a few returning cameos mainly by James Brown (r.i.p godfather of soul) and Aretha Franklin. And I admit the musical numbers in this are pretty awesome.There's also a scene where the band go to see a voodoo queen/priestess by the name of Queen Mousette (this scene is later referenced/paid homage to in the second Pirates of the Caribbean movie).So the voodoo priestess asks the band if they know any calapyso songs to which Elwood tells her that the band can play all kinds of musical but to the calalypso part he says no (this is the second time Dan Akyroyd has actually said no when answering a powerful being such as a ghost, deity or sorceress - the first one being in Ghostbusters).Because of this she transforms them into green skinned zombies that sing calapyso songs and I admit, their performance of Funky Nassau is pretty good. But this is just flat out of nowhere. It's like I'm expecting MJ to make an appearance and start dancing along with them (hey...it would be Thriller The Sequel).And this just comes out of nowhere. So...yeah...it's...a Big Lipped Aligator Moment! Also a few of the band members get turned into stone. Don't tell me Queen Mousette is actually part Gorgon! There are also several scenes in which several more of the ever-growing enemy list for the bad show up including some russians who get turned into mice.There are more wacky car chase scenes, some more musical numbers and Elwood gives a speech which is extremely epic as well as some goofy slapstick including the band getting covered in goo (most likely the same stuff the Stay Puft Marshmellow Man was made out of). And after all this - the band finally get to perform as the movie ends, during the end credits we see a performance by James Brown along with the band.So that was Blues Brothers 2000, and was it any good? Not really. It's pretty iffy overall - the musical numbers are fun and there are some good scenes but most of it is completely weird.Also why doesn't it ever explain the cause of Jake's death? I'm serious. We don't ever get an explanation for this at all.Dan Akyroyd does well but I think even he knows how bad this movie was going to be, as for the other performers - well they did rather well but again....you can't top the original.The movie is okay....but it will never be as good as the original. Maybe i'm looking at this through Nostalgia goggles but i personally believe and know that the original is and always will be the best.Blues Brothers 20000 doesn't hold up well and compared to the original just flat out fails.I give it 2 out of 10 stars and only 1% out of 1000, the music was the only strong point - the rest was just plain weird.I don't recommend seeing this one, instead...just stick to the original movie and you'll be fine.

The second - well, as we all know, we don't have John Belushi with us anymore, which is one strike right there. The filmmakers made the good choices of John Goodman and Joe Morton as backup singers. Had they stopped there, the film would have been much better.Instead, a kid was thrown into the mix. An orphan, of course. Awwww. Elwood Blues is supposed to act as mentor for the kid (Buster), but forgets to return Buster to the orphanage, getting half the cops in the country and several mean orphanage workers on his tail.Now, the whole point of the first Blues Brothers film is that these guys can't stay out of trouble. The character of Elwood, with or without Brother Jake, is going to get himself in it up to his eyeballs. The whole story about Elwood being chased for kidnapping is ludicrous. Elwood is going to get in trouble for one thing or another. It didn't have to be kidnapping.Thus, we end up listening to a prepubescent kid squalling the lines of a damned good song, one that was belted out by three fine singers (Aykroyd, Goodman, and Morton), thus ruining the whole effect. It's no wonder that the Blues Brothers lost the Battle of the Bands - I'd have booed them offstage for bringing a kid into the mix.There's an cloying, aren't-we-cute gushiness about Buster and his little Blues Brothers outfit that almost gags me. I loved the musical numbers and all the guest artists - and what an impressive group they are! - so I can't understand why the filmmakers would drag down the storyline by introducing a kid, and throwing in all the clichés associated with a small child interacting with adults. The kid is precocious. He's (supposedly, though I see no evidence of it) a good singer. He gives a pep talk at the crucial time. He's easy to bond with. It just doesn't work.I will watch it for the music and for Elwood's highly inventive method of parallel parking, but I fast-forward through Buster's scenes.

Almost every single scene from the original classic is duplicated and the only thing it adds is some crappy CG scenes which fit to the movie about as well as trousers to a rubber duck. Why on earth did they have to wait for 17 years if they hadn't a single new idea? The worst thing is that with truckloads of money and modern SFX, you would think this one would have the greatest car-crashing scene of all time, considering the predecessors funny sequences. But no. In this the police cars only smash to each others rear end for ten minutes. For Christ's sake! Haven't these cops ever heard that you can brake with your car? So in fact it's the worst car smashing scene of all time.The best thing about this movie is the music. There are cameos from old faces (Aretha Franklin, James Brown) and newcomers (Wilson Pickett, Eric Clapton etc.) alike. The soundtrack is almost as good as the first one with classics like R.E.S.P.E.C.T and great new songs like Looking for a Fox. The only bad new song is Turn on Your Love Light, which is like a lame copy of the original movie's Everybody Needs Somebody to Love.As for the cast, they never really fill the void John Belushi left (maybe Jack Black would've been a good contender). John Goodman is good and surprisingly he can also sing OK, but he as well as Joe Morton are underwritten. And it's never a clever idea to bring a kid to a sequel (the Mummy Returns, anyone?) especially a singing and dancing one. Dan Aykroyd is still the quieter brother and that's why he's really not a convincing main character and the band members still can't act to save their lives. Frank Oz manages to raise a smile, though.All in all, it's not a very bad movie, and you might actually enjoy it if you haven't seen the original. See the original, if you can choose. It's still really funny, cool and funky unlike this. Sadly, John Landis is on the club of the directors, who can't make worthy successors to the great movies in their earlier career. It's spooky, that all of them are actually named John; Landis, Woo, McTiernan and Carpenter.**1/2 (5/10)Best Part (SPOILERs) All the musical scenes are worthy but the Ghost Riders in the Sky sequence is probably the best.

I especially loved the scene following the Blues Brothers encounter with Bob, the disgruntled bar owner from the first film (a restauranteur in this sequel).  The Blues Brothers magic was in full form during this car chase sequence.  This film needed more of it, much more. SPOILER ALERT The story however....let's break it down and see where we went wrong.  The opening is fine, Elwood is released from an 18 year stint.  What's unbelievable here is that he would have NO idea of the fate of his brother Jake.  Next up on the no-no meter is the revelation that, despite all the effort the Blues Brothers made to save the Penguin's orphanage in the first film, it was closed down and sold anyway!  Everything the Blues Brothers had achieved in the first film was completely shot to hell.  A minor thing that I find amusing is how Cab (Morton) has an EXTREMELY short conversation via phone with his mother regarding his lineage.  He plops the question on her like a ton of bricks, gets his answer, and hangs up on her with total ease. What the?  I understand the pace of the film has to be given precedence, but damn!  And finally, the ending...what a shame this is.  We journey with Elwood to perform a concert contest for the Voodoo Queen (definate Landis influence here with Aykroyd flair).  Why does he need to be there?  We don't know, but we'll root for him anyway.  Here's the bummer- he loses the contest.  Very unsatisfying.  We want Elwood to win this contest.  We appreciate the rival Louisiana Gator Boys' immense list of talent, but come on!  This isn't who's supposed to win.  Anyhow, the film ends precisely with what we want to see more of...hundreds of cops chasing the Bluesmobile down the road.  We're only treated with this at the very end, and it doesn't but a minute.  A shame.  Blues Brothers 2000 is mostly populated with the kinds of elements that we fast-forward on the original.  Too much of the bad stuff and definitely not enough of the things that made the original such a fun treat.  And most disappointing of all was the poorly executed humor. This film had nothing but forced gags which left audiences chuckling only due to the fact that they felt they should.  I can only identify two times that this film got genuine laughs.  One line of Goodman's concerning a medical college, and another from one of Aykroyd's wonderfully mind-boggling monologues concerning the fall of the Romanovs.I'm not in the business of badmouthing people, and I still have immense respect for Aykroyd, Landis, and the various cast/crew/performers from this film and I know they will continue to achieve great things in their careers; but I won't hesitate to point out bad performances and bad mistakes. Blues Brothers 2000 is ridden with too many bad mistakes that SHOULDN'T have happened.

Like the film, is it really needed?  Really, there was enough Blues Brothers in the first film to last a lifetime.  I can't even remember when I saw the Blue Brothers movie for the first time but I have sure seen it a million times replayed on television.  It seems every few weeks I'm watching a few minutes, and the film plays pretty well that way.  It was much too long but it's parts were better than the whole.  At least you never had to worry what was happening, it was just a series of musical numbers and chases and I would usually stay tuned for two chases and song (the length between commercials).  Chance had it that it was usually the chase through the mall or the scene where the Nazis go flying off the end of the interstate.  Now we get a sequel and I'm sure I'll end up seeing it on television over and over again (odds are I'll end up catching the underwater driving scene each and every time and watching the boat go flying in the air on top of Darryl Hammond and sorry I had missed the strip club scene earlier with Matara.)  As everyone states the plot is exactly like the first, almost scene per scene  the prison release, the orphanage, the racist, the men with guns (okay in the first it was a woman with gun), the gathering of the band, the unexpected country gig, the Baptist revival (once again with James Brown and an acrobatic congregation), the police chase pile up, Frank Oz, etc...etc...etc...  The climax of the film appears to be in one of Dan Ackroyd's HOUSE OF BLUES complete with a decade's worth of bookings all performing on stage at the same time (B.B.King, Eric Clapton, Isacc Hayes, Dr. John, Travis Tritt, Lou Rawls and the list goes on). I like the Disneyesque Voodoo decor at the HOUSE OF BLUES and I liked it here (hey, I'm a white Californian).  Ackroyd warned audiences of homogenized music replacing the real stuff when he introduced the Blues Brothers years ago in a concert debut in Los Angeles.  Here we see the homogenized blues performances from everyone involved.  At least with the legends in this film it's not bad, just not their best.  There is absolutely no heart to their performances and for blues that's not good.  When the late Cab Calloway appeared in concert in the first film you could tell that Calloway knew this was a chance he hadn't had in years (to be in a film with such a large, young audience) and really poured his heart and talent into it.  The principal players in this film are fine (Ackroyd and company give more to this script than would be expected) and seeing legendary comedic actress Kathleen Freeman (Mother Mary Stigmata) still at the top of her game is terrific.  The most out of place scene in the film is the strip bar scene (director John Landis loves his naked ladies), but on the other hand the most memorable character...for me...was indeed the stripper Matara (played by Shann Johnson).  Why haven't we seen ...um more...of this woman?  Awesome WWF body, sweet personality, good with kids (the only time the kid in this film seemed happy was when he was with Matara.  Good taste kid.)  If only the story stayed in the bar, did some character development, developed relationships, played a little south side blues (with Shann Johnson dancing), then that would have been a great film.

Also, for die hard fans of the original, they will feel a great, unavoidable void where John Belushi fit in the original as Jake Blues (Belushi is dead). So that's the disappointment. And there are others, including the inevitable rehashing by Landis and Aykroyd of the past plot line almost to a T with extra fluff like the responsibility factor, whatever that is, put upon Jake and the kid. The car chases, too, are only so-so when compared to the audacity and bizarre originality of the first film's chases (good for their time, and almost too simple and predictable to do twenty years later). But the film isn't totally irredeemable- it almost sets itself up NOT to be by overloading with various Blues icons both old and not so old. So the climactic big performance featuring a who's who of blues and rock musicians is almost worth seeking out the film to see, at least if you're a fan. But it is definitely hit (very narrow hit) or very much a miss for original fans of the SNL series and (compared to this) absolute post-modern 1980 classic comedy. That it only provides a few solid laughs make it all the more dreary, a sign of Landis's decline from his high peak in the 80's. Cameos include Frank Oz, Darrell Hammond, BB King, Steve Lawrence, Eric Clapton, Erykah Badu, Aretha Franklin, Isaac Hayes, Dr. John, Steve Winwood, John Popper (Blues Traveler), and James Brown as the always awesome Reverend Cleophus James (who actually provides the funniest part of the film after the end credits!)

It made the quantum leap from the screen to peoples' everyday lives - you could safely go to any party and at least one person would know every line of dialogue by heart.  I am one of such people, and I have subjected my friends, on every possible occasion, to hours of unmitigated Blues trivia.Sadly, like almost every other sequel, the Blues Brothers 2000 falls by the wayside.  For a start, what Blues Brothers movie could be complete without John Belushi?  It's like trying to start a car without an engine.  Although John Goodman does an admirable job, and although he doesn't play the part of Elwood, the devotee can sense a vacuum throughout the whole film, as if to say, This isn't right - something is missing.  One also asks the question, what would John Belushi make of this?To be fair, the first Blues Brothers didn't have much in terms of plot.  It did not have important subtextual significance, nor was it rich in character development.  What it did have though, and what made it so popular, was its combination of genuine humour, wonderful music and ground-breaking car chases.  When it was made, it was one of the most expensive films produced, and it cemented Dan Ackroyd's career.  Blues Brothers 2000 though, will appeal only to the most diehard Blues fans.The movie's chase plot is simplistic and almost identical to its predecessor, only more idiotic in parts.  The comedy is not as sharp nor as abundant as in the original movie.  The one main redeeming feature about the Blues Brothers 2000 though - the one thing that saved it from being a sheer failure - was the music.Never before in a feature film have I witnessed a more impressive, talented and prominent group of musicians.  From Aretha Franklin to B. B. King; James Brown to Dr John, and not to mention the sensational (albeit ageing) Blues Brothers Band. This film is a wonderful celebration of song, and only the most stubborn, unspirited human being could fail to enjoy the soundtrack. This is blues at its best, with dashes of many other forms of music. Indeed, it is the music that holds The Blues Brothers together.Fans of the original film may feel cheated and upset, and I know a good many people who have refused to see the Blues Brothers 2000 on ethical grounds - It can't be as good as the original, they say, so I want to keep my Blues Brothers faith pure.  To these people I would give the following advice - see the film for the music, dancing and car chases, and keep your finger ready on the fast forward button for the sections in between.

It was a fun way to relive the 'Blues Brothers' experience - 18 years later.  There are so many of the newer (and older) generation who never saw the original, much less understand the influence that the musical artists involved in the music of the 'Blues Brothers', had on the music of today.  I recently watched 'Blues Brothers 2000' with some young people who didn't have a clue, and seeing things through their fresh eyes, made this movie very exciting.  Immediately after, they were on the Internet looking up various musical artists from the movie so that they could get to know the music that they now loved, but had missed out on.

I can not truly classify this as a movie. It pretty much retold the original story of the Blues Brothers and made its tributes towards John Belushi and some of the other late actors of the original. I do admit, this was a shocker. It was like having a funeral being portrayed onscreen with a couple of songs to add to it. The car chase scenes were missing something, I knew they were. In fact I thought the only part I thought was good was the songs. I actually thought that I was going to go in there and expect a fairly serious comedy. I obviously didn't know the Blues Brothers! So after a year or so, I was given the opportunity to see the original and after I did, I loved it! I thought that it was a classic and I was living and breathing the utter unrealisticness of it! It was really extraordinary! After seeing the original, everything fell into place about this one. This one is nothing more than a tribute to all of those poor late cast members like Belushi and John Candy. Certainly not the best movie in the world, but watch it if you're a fan of the original and you want to watch it die...

The Blue's Brothers is all about the Blues and I feel sad for those reviewers who can't appreciate the quality of the music and musicians showcased in this excellent and entertaining movie. There are so many goose-bump inspiring vocal and instrumental performances by some of North America's most legendary musicians. The dancing is good too. The car crash is fun. There are some great lines. I think there is a serious side to this movie though and it is summed up neatly in Elwood's inspirational speech when he reminds his rebellious band members what society will be left with if real musicians give up making music. I think that if you read a review by someone complaining about the plot you should quit reading right away because that person, who probably never ventures beyond the top 10 in his musical tastes, obviously missed the whole point of this movie.

After being escorted outside, he stood beside the road, eagerly awaiting his brother Jake to pick him up. Several hours go by and Jake had not arrived. Elwood waited until the next morning, when the warden finally came out and told him the awful news Jake had passed away. Elwood received a ride home from Matara, a colleague of his old bandmember Willie. Once back in town, Elwood went to Malvern Gasperon's used car lot and set his sites on a classic police cruiser, similar to the one he had in the last adventure. But it was gonna cost $500, which he didn't have. Next, Elwood visits Mother Mary Stigmata at the new orphanage, since the old one had long since been demolished. Right away, Elwood learns that his old buddy Curtis had died. He also learns that Curtis had an illegitimate son. That's also when Elwood meets a young, sarcastic orphan named Buster. Mother Mary wanted Elwood to spend some time with the youngster--whether he wanted to or not.Elwood attempted to ditch the kid, though unsuccessfully, and seek out Curtis' son. He found him at the police station. He was Commander Cabel Cab Chamberlain. Elwood introduced himself, then told his sort-of brother that he was thinking of putting the band back together and asked if he'd like to join. He also asks to borrow $500 for a car. But Cab had the goods on Elwood and his late brother Jake. He refused, and personally kicked him out of the office. Outside, Buster picked his pocket and gave the wallet to Elwood, which ironically contained $500. So, Elwood purchased the police cruiser then he and Buster go for a very slow cruise. They stop off at Willie's strip club to try and convince Willie rejoin the band. Willie was hesitant, because the Russian mafia was watching him. But, Elwood and the bartender, Mack McTeer, bound and gag two Russian mobsters and leave them in the alley. This did not sit well with their leader, who demanded vengeance against Elwood and Willie; Elwood gives Mack an opportunity to perform at the club and sees he has talent. Just then, the Russians arrive and shoot up the club, then torch it. Luckily all the strippers, patrons, Matara, Elwood, Mack, Willie and Buster escape in time. Mack and Willie join the band. Next, Elwood tracks down the other members of the band Matt Guitar Murphy, Donald Duck Dunne, Tom Bones Malone, Murph, Mr. Fabulous, and Blue Lou Marini and, in his own crude and crass way, convinces them to rejoin. Elwood even had Mack and Buster fitted with their own Blues suits. Now, all they needed was a gig. Unbeknownst to them, the Illinois state police and the Russian mafia were after them.Maury Sline, their old booking agent, managed to book them a gig at a county fair in Kentucky, and, an opportunity to play at Queen Mousette's Battle of the Bands at her club in Louisiana. So, Elwood, Mack and Buster in the new Bluesmobile, and the band in tow, hit the road. Always managing to stay one step ahead of a furious Cab and the entire Illinois police force. They play at the fair in Kentucky, but learned they wanted a bluegrass band, and not a blues band. So they played bluegrass, blues style. All the while Cab and the cops watched the stage, but monster trucks and a storm proved the perfect distraction; the Blues brothers and the band manage to elude the cops at a local tent revival, with the Reverend Cleophus James. When Cab arrived, something extraordinary happened. It was a miracle, some say. He had a revelation. His destiny became clear. He donned a nifty Blues outfit and joined the band. But the rest of the police force weren't buying it, so they chased the Blues Brothers band all the way to Louisiana where they competed in Queen Mousette's Battle of the Bands--and lost to the Louisiana Gator Boys. Well before long, Elwood and the gang found themselves surrounded by every cop in a thousand mile radius, as well as the Russian mafia. And worst of all, Mother Mary Stigmata! There was nothing left to do but run. Buster had a plan. While Mack and Cab created a diversion on stage, Elwood and Buster made a run for it in the Bluesmobile followed by a very long cavalcade of police cars.Blues Brothers 2000--what can I say? It was pretty good. It started off very properly with a proper dedication to John Belushi, Cab Calloway and John Candy. Dan Aykroyd returns as Elwood Blues, everyone's favorite crafty Blues con. John Goodman is on board as Mighty Mack McTeer. Joe Morton is Cab. J. Evan Bonifant is Buster. Frank Oz returns as the warden. And the late Kathleen Freeman returns as Mary Stigmata. Familiar faces Aretha Franklin and James Brown are here too. Belushi's absence from this film is definitely noticeable, but I think it's good they made Elwood a more central character, since in the original it was obvious Jake was the central character. They gave Elwood a chance to build. But personally, this wasn't much of a sequel, but rather a rehash of the first film. But if you liked the first film and would like to see a jazzy update, then Blues Brothers 2000 is for you. I recommend it. Like they say, the Lord works in mysterious ways.

The first hour of it is not badly written and has some amusing parts, but the second hour is an overblown mess that makes no sense.

Without taking anything away from John Goodman, Belushi's presence is certainly noticed and missed. Goodman does a fair job, but any redeeming features of his performance in the wake of the still obvious void of Belishi's, is overshadowed by the addition of not only on additional main character, but two. It's almost like they went.... **** it, lets add another blues brother when they knew the plot wasn't working. This really bothered me as I felt it trivialized the movie and cheapened the whole BB mythos altogether and seriously weaken the credibility of the movie.The storyline tries in many ways to copy the original storyline, with little success. It's almost like using the same road map, but replacing the destination with different ones. Some of the charm of the original for this reason is very much lost, but there are still some elements of the original movie present in terms of feel. The concessions made in terms of the addition of characters, as well as the lack-luster plot does more to weaken the appeal of the original movie that it does to even, in some way, strengthen the mythos.The only redeeming feature, of this otherwise lack luster piece is the music and thank gawd for that one. Appearances by Erykah Badu, B.B. King, Eric Clapton, Aretha Franklin, Jeff Baxter, Isaac Hayes, James Brown, Blues Traveler Bo Diddley, Stevie Winwood and many others, along with great musical interludes pushes up the overall appeal of this movie.However at the end of the day this is not a concert, its movie and any redeeming musical performances, even a really great musical line-up and interlude does not take away from a weak story based only on a gimmick with no substance to speak of.

Eh.Plot After getting out of jail and finding out that his brother died (glad to see Aykrod didn't ignore this fact) Elwood Blues once again finds himself in the world with no direction. Visiting the ophanage he and Jake saved in the last film, he is given a kid Buster (J. Evan Bonifant), to watch over for the day to keep him out of trouble. Of course if you saw the original that doesn't last long. Pretty soon he gains new partners Big Mack (John Goodman, in my opinion, making a great replacement to Jake.) and later Cab (Joe Morton) a police chief who was chasing him until the calling of the blood took over, and once again getting the band back together on yet another mission from God. Along with the Chicgo Police Department on his tale for a misunderstood kidnapping, as well as the mob and white power terroists.The problem with this film is that the music overshadows the story causing it to take a back seat and never really being given a chance to developed whereas the first movie blended both seemlessly. Granted  BB2000 never takes itself seriously as the first one did (even moreso with puppetry and special effects) and the music is really jamming here with musical talent new and old (gotta love the concert scene). But in the end the story just doesn't stack up to the original ending on something of a cliffhanger (guess there was a third on planned). Still, its it own movie.

It is, like the original,a wonderful blend of music, comedy, car chases, and criminal escapades. Before I saw this it I was a little worried that director John Landis and his co-writer Dan Aykroyd were going to make an abominable disgrace, but I was worrying for nothing because they ended up making one heck of good sequel.It is about Elwood Blues trying to put his life back together after he finaly gets out of prison. He immediatly learns about his brother Jake's death ( Elwood's subtle reaction is touching). He also learns that Curtis, the man who was like a father to him has also died. Elwood obviously needs a reason to continue living, so he reunites his old blues band and recruits some new singers.At first the movie suggests that Elwood got the band back together just so he would have a job. But later we learn, in a priceless pep-talk he gives the band, that he has a bigger and deeper reason for getting the band back together. John Goodman. Joe Morton, and J. Evan Bonifit do a great job as the new Blues Brothers. And the movie brings back a lot of the original characters, which is great.Aside from the spectacular soundtrack, it of course has some monster car chases and crashes.Car crashes have always been John Landis' specialty. He tops himself in this movie,and he tops himself BIG. John Landis also does a great job with the musical sequences, two in particular The hilarious county fair sequence, and the dazzling tent revival meeting. My faviorite scene is when Joe Morton turns into a blues brother at James Browns rivival. I also love when Elwood hooks the car up to remote control. Well, anyway, Blues Brothers 2000 stays true to the spirit of the original, and there isn't a movie out there with more energy than this one. It's got rhythm, it's got music, it's got car crashes. Who could ask for anything more?

He and Landis both should be handed a hard slap for this one, and I'm sure they were.  I had more than my share of doubts when this was released in the theatres, and at the risk of being shunned by friends, I didn't attend it.  Then came the video release, which I managed to avoid for about 20 days, until finally, I couldn't stand it anymore.  So, going against all the poor reviews by fans and critics alike, not to mention my own feelings, I rented it.  The film starts promising as Elwood is released from the same prison Jake was 18 years ago.  From there, the band had me singing the blues, and I don't mean that in a good way.  The film's plot, if you can call it that, drags Elwood through a torturous 2 hours, in which time he becomes a mentor, a step-brother, a shaving cream covered baffoon,  and even a zombie (yes you heard me right, a zombie).  The supporting cast doesn't help either, even though new blues bro Joe Morton holds his own on the musical numbers, but who cares?

The original movie was reflection of the late 70's, and all those who fell for the Blues Brothers when they were actually performing live absolutely loved the cult classic.Don't get me wrong, I LOVED the first movie, but it has that certain feel that you just don't get in the second movie.You could tell that 2000 was more or less going for the whole family film feel (thus the kid, a younger member of the cast with whom younger children could identify with).

Many of the musicians who were showcased in the original as almost forgotten relics now are credited as inspirations for many of the most popular artists today.On one half, it has reminders of the original, callbacks to old jokes, references to old scenes, but for the most part it is a celebration of the blues in all it's forms. It's almost a Who's Who of Blues and Soul. If thats what floats your boat, then the DVD is worth it's price purely for the 'ultimate' jam session at the end.Yes ... there is virtually NO PLOT!

Since then, this trend has returned in other shows, but in this film it only does so much. Having original songs is okay, but in this case, it's just a corny addition with zombified performers. The addition of Goodman's character, who starts out as a nebbish employee for a strip club, is reasonable since he did perform with Ackroyd in earlier performances with John Belushi's brother Jim. Jim Belushi is nowhere to be found, though, thus throwing off a major factor might have made the movie a little more tolerable. Even the addition of a long lost, black son of Jake's is forgivable sighting the lack of Belushi. But the addition of a little boy dressed exactly like the rest of them but wearing tennis shoes adds too much campy, corny nonsense. The kid serves no purpose other than to be cute and add a fun for the family factor that was not in the much grittier first film. The first film featured Nazis, spurned fiances attacking with bazookas, stolen air raid sirens, driving around the ghettos of Chicago where blues musicians could still play in the street. This film features traveling into Creole country in an overly-idealized south. The music is lackluster because it features songs that have little to do with the story line. The best example of this is the use of the song Think in the first film, which was executed perfectly in a small diner set; compared to the songs Respect and 864-5789 which are a used terribly and with awkward timing. At least James Brown didn't start breaking into I feel good. Someone else wrote that this couldn't have been a concert movie because those are too slow paced. I disagree in that I have seen some well shot concerts, or other films in which the concert idea was centered around a reasonable plot, but not a similar plot to other films, and the music was ingrained into the film almost flawlessly. The Blues Brothers, The Wall, Bugsy Malone (admittedly a musical), et cetera. The original featured a great plot and numerous humor points that are memorable scenes. This film used the Blues Brothers name at a bad time, and what is worse used the number 2000 when every company was putting out 2000's once a month Dracula 2000 is an example of this nightmare in which everyone adds something to their title to make it sound cool and edgy (remember all of the movies with the letter X in them?). It would be okay if the film was released in 2000, but it wasn't. It would be okay if they had called it Blues Brothers '98 and made it a film of a concert with the old band, guest singers doing some of their other favorites live. It would have been okay to make it a comedy if the film didn't need the music to hold up the plot as much. In the first movie, the music was lively and entertaining, and it was at a point when many of those musicians had been largely forgotten due to changing trends in popular musical tastes. The script was conceived of and written in the Blues country or as mister Tonso'fun Ackroyd called it where the barbecue is good. Ackroyd should have hit the gym to get in the same kind of shape he was in back in 1980. Now he's a comedic actor who has been in so many bad SNL movies (Coneheads) and has lost touch over the years after performing nothing but roles like Ray in Ghostbusters and singing We Are The World. A sequel made 20 years ago with a long lost son played by someone who was as gifted a performer would have pulled off the role and made a killing, but instead, this film was offered up to a public who wasn't demanding anything more from the filmmakers. I'd have been happier if they'd simply re-released as a special edition with deleted scenes, new special effects, additional performances, and giant dewback lizards/imperial walkers/a digital mother superior/Jake throwing the first bottle.

Dan isn't at his finest, but still does a good job along side the brilliance of John Goodman.  The first movie was so good they couldn't beat it, but if don't compare the two BB2000 is still a movie to be seen by anyone who loves a good tune, and if they were to make a BB3000 like some mentioned I would be the first to see it and please have respect enough to not show hate to a movie by its predeccors it either causes disappointment (this movie) or it gives the new possibly better movie a bad name before it starts.

This is when the plot goes somewhat&#133;hazy. Yes, it's not as good as the original (but could it ever be?). Yes, the songs aren't as good as before (ditto). And yes, the storyline seems somewhat random (They've got to get to the battle of the bands. Why? Ummm&#133;) But this film seems somehow able to redeem itself. Dan Akroyd plays a much-changed Elwood, who whilst not as funny without John Belushi to work with, is still charming in his own way. A surprisingly adept John Goodman plays Mighty Mac, singing well in those dulcet tones. Joe Morton plays Cab's protégé (although he doesn't know it) and works well with what he's given, script-wise. J. Evan Bonifant proved to be the greatest surprise of the piece. Whilst bordering on the insufferable cute-dom of so many Hollywood kids, he manages to pull himself up to a hilarious performance (check out the dancing & harmonica playing).A star-studded cast (to those who recognise them) helps fill out the film, and fans of the original will enjoy recognising familiar faces & places. The songs, whilst not having the same toe-tapping qualities of the original are all entertaining enough, as are the lower quality car chases.I know most people will hate this film it meanders, it repeats the original and has the most unsatisfying ending of just about any film I've seen, and yet the characters, music, dance and comedy all make this a film worth seeing.Long live the Blues.

After all, the original was one of the greatest movies ever and trying to recreate that atmosphere, let alone top it, would be all but impossible.  However, within the first five minutes I knew that I'd been worrying about nothing.I can understand why some people wouldn't like it, whether they are fans of the original or not, and I think they could have done a better job with some parts of the movie (especially the ending) but it was fast paced, fitfully funny, and most importantly, had great music. There is no way that anyone can deny that this movie pulls together the greatest ensemble of super-star musicians ever seen on film.  With such legends as B.B. King, Eric Clapton, Stevie Winwood, and Lou Rawls you can't go wrong.  ESPECIALLY when they're in the same band!!  Then you have Eretha Franklin and Wilson Pickett to contend with elsewhere in the movie. And that's not to say the Blues Brothers band do a bad job themselves.  With a hilariously literal version of Ghost Riders In the Sky and other greats scattered throughout, there's no way that this film can be faulted for its music.Nor for that matter can it be faulted for its stunts, with one pile-up containing the most cars wrecked in a single scene in cinematic history and a classic crash involving a car full of members of the russian mafia, a jar of carpet tacs (or as Elwood amusing corrected, dry wall nails), a burning strip club, and 50m of a dark Chicago  street.  Scenes like these only go to prove that Director John Landis has lost none of the excellence he showed in the first blues brothers movie.If you want mega budget demolitions scenes, a dramatic soundtrack, and award winning Oscar nominated acting, then rent titanic.  But if you want great R&B music, impossible stunts, and a whole load of great laughs (aided in no small way by the deadpan acting talents of Dan Ackroyd, John Goodman, Joe Morton and newcomer J.Evan Bonifant), then you can't do too much better than Blues Brothers 2000 "},{"Title":"Great Movie","Date":"10 January 1999","Score":"0 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Comedy, Crime","Review":"  This movie was great.
