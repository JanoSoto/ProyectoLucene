I have read many, many reviews which seem to have been written by those who have little to no idea of just how complex and difficult Toni Morrison's original novel can be.  Of course Beloved (the movie) will be long, and of course it will be emotionally draining and even confusing - the book was!  That said, I loved the novel and the film version of it, which follows the original material almost verbatim.  (To try and change the story would be to tamper needlessly with a Pulitzer and Nobel Prize-winning book).  I am no Oprah nut but she obviously had a deep respect and understanding for the story, which is evident in her surprisingly understated acting.  Thandie Newton was simply amazing; I am glad I watched the film if for nothing else than the chance to see her performance (which, to be honest, has helped a key facet of the book make sense for me).  The production design is flawless, and, as always, Jonathan Demme proves he's more than above average as a director.  If you like pulp trash and want your movies dumb, loud, and shallow, avoid the movie version of Beloved.  But if you're looking for a magnificently acted and gorgeously produced film, see this movie the first chance you get. I'm very glad I did.

She once said in an interview that she wrote the book to be disorienting, in some ways to re-enact the feeling of the slave diaspora.I thought the book heart-wrenching, at times gut-wrenching, and vivid. The character of Paul D never made much sense, seeming like a man waiting for something to happen, but Sethe burned off the page.  What I remember most is Baby Suggs' speech at the rock, which the film has divided into three segments.I projected Beloved for the college theater and I have to say it was long and arduous, especially if you haven't read the novel.  There is no SENSE to the PAIN that goes on with these characters; in Braveheart and Titanic, we have a certain tragic pleasure in mass death or torture that we can't receive from Beloved.  I read a lot of comments talking about the ghost in Beloved, but the ghost is more of a catalyst for looking into the characters than the star of the film.I admired the time put in most.  It just seemed like Demme and Tak Fujimoto, and the lighting designer as well, gave the actors the time they needed to act and sink into things unlike traditional MTV-editing, some scenes were comprised of only one shot, usually tracking, as Paul D and Sethe in the cornfield. The score was brilliant; Portman really found a grace in stillness and the trembling African voice and the flute.  It was bare but riveting at the same time.People have said that the film went for too much shock value.  That's possible- did we need the close-up of the dead child at the breast?  No. But then again when we read it in the book, don't we think of it?  Don't we for a split second see that image in our heads?  I for one thought of much more graphic things when Morrison discussed Paul D and Beloved's night in the shed.  The camera and the actors treat the world of Beloved and the audience with respect.  Winfrey does seem more like someone who loves Sethe's character, than Sethe herself, but she did it for me.  The sadness, the strength, emptiness, she did it, and Lisa Gay Hamilton as the young Sethe was riveting with her time in the film.  The look in her eyes when Schoolteacher says Animal is amazing.Danny Glover always does a good job, but he didn't really amaze me.  For me, you know what you're getting with Glover, nice guy, troubled soul, easy-going with fits of rage every now and then.  It's what he likes to play, and he does it well here but no surprises.  The surprises are Winfrey, and Kimberly Elise especially in those crucial minutes when she decides to leave home, the fear and determination on her face.  (She somehow becomes more sexual by the end of the film when she sees Paul D.)  Thandie Newton is incredibly freaky and disgusting as Beloved with the exception of that ONE long gaze she gives Danny Glover that night, seduction, perfect symmetry. And Beah Richards as Baby Suggs I wanted her to be my mother.  She broke my heart with her religion This is the prize.  This is the prize.  The preaching scenes are INCREDIBLE in this film, especially since Tak Fujimoto chooses a circular tracking shot that allows them to do it all at once.There isn't much redemption at the end.  Sethe is drained and miserable. Paul D is on his own but still not totally free. I think Roger Ebert's comment put it best the happy ending of Beloved is that the ordeal is OVER. There is no sense to the pain, but one hopes at the end that there can be healing.I loved this film.  I loved the fact that it's not hammering any one message home, but you can take things about motherhood, race, brutality, the dangers of love and commitment, freedom, and chains out with you it's all there.  And it is as beautiful as it is wrenching.

Oprah was a slave who had gained freedom; then one day the people tried to take her kids away to slavery. Oprah didn't want that so she attempt to kill them.  One thing that really set the plot to the movie is one died and came back as a ghost.  Many people are also talking bad about Thandie's part, but she was a ghost who was 2 years old in the body of a 20yr old.  She came back and only wanted her mother.  Beloved set a spell on Paul D because she wanted to be close to her mother like he was. What is so hard to understand about the movie I don't get.

I think the film is amazing, intelligent and emotive, and does justice to Toni Morrison's incredible novel (one of the best I have ever read). However, I can understand why some people are confused; I think the film is easier to grasp if you read the book. To clarify some of the confusion * Sethe (Oprah) intends to kill her children before taking her own life, to protect them all from the suffering that awaits them at Sweet Home (the plantation). However, she only succeeds in killing her baby daughter, Beloved, before she is caught. * Sethe is imprisoned for killing her daughter, but is later released due to the efforts of abolitionists (including Baby Sugg's landlord). * Beloved dies as a young infant, and, despite the fact that she returns in the body of a young woman- the age she would have been, had she lived- she retains the emotional and social maturity of a baby (hence the freaky baby- wailing noises that Thandie Newton makes). * The scene where Oprah's character, Sethe, urinates, actually denotes that her waters are breaking again, before the second 'arrival' of her daughter (this happens when the family meet Beloved at the house) * Beloved seems to be both the 'reincarnation' of Sethe's dead daughter, and an embodiment of every African who suffered or died during slavery (particularly those slaves who died before their stories could be passed on).I apologise for the 'geekiness' of my semi- in-depth analysis- I studied the novel as part of my degree, and loved this adaptation. I think the actors are all amazing, and the film is definitely worth watching- especially if you are willing to read the book x.

I wish I'd read the book--perhaps I will, but I don't think so.  A film must stand by itself, or it is not a film.Beloved has long passages of greatness.  First, it contains one of the best and most fascinating performances I've seen in years, given by Thandie Newton.  She spent most of Gridlock'd in a coma, unfortunately, and that's the most notable role she's had until this one.  Her first speaking (if you'll call it that) line is gripping, frightening, and amusing, and she plays a mental defective in a manner which I've never seen before.  She has the loudest, rudest character, and many actresses would be put off by some of the things she must do throughout the film.  However, our attention is also held by her quiet moments, as well as a few shots where the camera is content to gaze tranquilly into her beautiful eyes.That camera is conducted with the supreme artistry of one of my favorite photographers, Tak Fujimoto, who was with director Jonathan Demme since the late '70s.  Fujimoto is in love with earth and flesh tones here, but he also shoots his actors' eyes as if they were a part of the human body we'd never really noticed before, and wanted to give them the attention they deserved. It's a great approach to cinematography that pays off an infinite number of times, from the first major shot, of Sethe and Paul D reuniting (as Winfrey and Glover look at each other, they look not just into the camera, but directly into OUR eyes), to the last major shot, Jason Robards (God love him) staring in horror at a most unusual scene in front of Sethe's home.This film is no The Color Purple, with Welles-influenced camera angles and sacchirine-induced uplift.  Beloved is a long, difficult, often off-putting film which doesn't really provide the big payoff at the end. This isn't necessarily good, but it isn't necessarily bad, either. Highlighted sequences include two truly remarkable sermons in the woods by Baby Suggs (Beah Richards--Oscar-nominated in '68 for Guess Who's Coming to Dinner?), a horrifying opening which features the most gruesome use of animatronics to date, and the notorious flashback which explain what has haunted Sethe all these years, and who Beloved really is.I compare this film with The Thin Red Line.  Both come from notable directors, are based on famous novels, used huge budgets, and were very long.  Both films disappointed many, many people.  Most importantly, however, they both had parts which were greater than the whole, occasional strokes of genius, and were made by men who took the art of filmmaking seriously.

I went in seeing this film without ever reading (or having any knowledge of) the award-winning novel that the film is apparently very tightly based upon. Even without that, this film was amazing. The movie begins with a woman named Sethe (Oprah Winfrey), a former slave living in 1800s Cincinatti, where an unseen presence is tearing apart her house, throwing things against the walls, and injuring her dog. Her two sons ultimately run away, terrified of the house, and her youngest daughter, Denver is forced to stay. Cut to eight years later, a friend of Sethe's, Paul D. (Danny Glover) reenters her life and moves in with Sethe. We got a ghost here, Denver tells him, and Paul D. mentions feeling an evil presence in her house, but Sethe tells him it's only sadness. Then later on, a mysterious young woman who calls herself Beloved is found standing in the front yard of the house. She can barely speak, can't move, and is almost like an infant in the body of a teenager. But who is she, where did she come from, and why is she there? Sethe's dark past holds the secret to Beloved's identity, which is revealed later on in the film.Beloved isn't a horror film, and I wasn't expecting one either. Granted, there are a few disturbing scenes (and a handful of rather scary moments), but this film is a drama more than anything and really focuses more on it's characters. The story itself is an interesting one at that, and after seeing this I'm tempted to go read the novel (which I hear the film is adapted to very closely). Everything in the film seems to be put together very nicely, and (unlike many people who claim to not be able to follow the story) I followed it very easily. There are some harsh themes that are a consistent part of the plot (mainly Sethe's horrible past as an abused slave) and there are some scenes that are truly hard to watch. While the supernatural element is a main theme in the movie, this isn't your average ghost story. It's not horrific or in-your-face, it's a much lighter and touching. I don't want to go too in-depth into the plot, because there are things that I could easily spoil and wouldn't want to - see the film for yourself. Character development is rampant in the film, and each of the characters mature in a different way throughout the course of the movie, and makes for some very interesting viewing as each of them grow in different ways.Performances are amazing from everyone involved. I'd never seen Oprah Winfrey act, I'd just seen her television talk-show a few times, but she proves in this film that she can (and very well too). Danny Glover also gives a very nice performance but it's overshadowed by the rest of the cast. Thandie Newton plays Beloved, and plays it perfectly - her character is mysterious and obscure, and she does it well. Kimberly Elise plays Sethe's daughter, Denver, and plays the character excellently. I can't say anything bad about the acting in any aspects - to sum it up as a whole, the acting here is just flat-out amazing. Along with the wonderful acting, the directing is great also. Academy Award winner Jonathan Demme (who also directed the award winning crime-suspense masterpiece The Silence of the Lambs) handles the story well and keeps things consistently absorbing and ultimately haunting. Very nice cinematography is present too, and there are tons of symbolic images throughout the film that are placed nicely in the mix, along with a lot of shots of nature and wildlife.Overall, Beloved is an amazing movie, and the people who are rating this as a '1/10' must have not seen very many movies, because this film is so far from a '1' that it's not even funny. Don't let the average user rating scare you off from this film, because it really deserves much better than that. I guess this is one of those love it or hate it movies, but I thought it was an unforgettable movie. 10/10.

Denver's inner self is often written on her face, saying more than a page of dialog could. Oprah as Sethe is always Oprah but somehow she shows you this woman's truth. It would be very interesting to see how this movie would have been with a different, lesser known actress in the role. Baby Sugg's sermon is a picture of the almost forgotten awareness of a state of love and freedom in the midst of a world filled with despair, loss, separation and hatred.I have also read the book and found it to be an extremely confusing, disorientating and yet somehow compelling experience. It is written I think to recreate in the reader the way we experience life ourselves, as emotional colors, in remembered snatches, through different lenses, and without it always making sense. I would definitely read it again having seen the film.

This one, however, falls flat the plot just wanders along from episode to confusing episode (with frequent and annoying use of extended fade-outs).Worse, despite all the horrifying things that happen to them, the movie's characters don't generate much sympathy. Why? Because while there's a strong sense of inner tumult, and lots of Exorcist-style physical turmoil (flying tables and glowing red lights -- gimme a break!!!) there's no sense of any real inner conflict. The characters just react -- to the inhumanity of the white slaveowners, or to the frequent supernatural outbursts. There's no evidence in their actions that there's anything they've had to weigh or be confused by. The things that have happened to Sethe (Oprah) are revealed in flashback form, so unfortunately there's not much chance for you as viewer to get involved in them -- it's stuff that's already happened, and you're just being filled in, in shorthand form (prefab context).Another major problem this thing is WAY too long. The movie meanders for another 45 minutes to an hour after what is clearly the climactic scene, and for what??? It just kind of winds down in some very expected ways.

It has been eighteen years since her traumatic escape from slavery, and she now tries to lead a quiet life in futile hope her estranged husband might still be alive. One summer day, an old friend from Sweet Home randomly shows up at the doorstep looking for a welcomed place to stay. Sethe's home is apparently haunted and touched by forces of the past, a fact that leaves Denver helpless and unable to cope with such stress on a daily basis. Paul D. and Sethe begin living as a couple (and literally have sex in every other scene). Soon, however, things take a turn for the bizarre when all three return home from an outing and find a destitute girl in their front yard. Her name is 'Beloved'...the same word which is engraved on the tombstone of Sethe's long since dead infant...My initial impression of Beloved is that it is probably one of the *scariest* films I've ever seen and I don't mean it in a sarcastic sense. It is powerfully creepy. Sethe's flashbacks will be too explicit for certain viewers. Also, what was up with the unconvincing birth-in-a-boat scene? It takes a lot more than a few quick pushes to have a baby. Even in its near three hour entirety, I felt pressed to comprehend everything and filter the weird imagery in my mind. The entity that is Beloved will make your heart break with pity until she seduces her mother's boyfriend...then you'll just be disturbed, there's no way around it. (I want you to touch me on the inside part! Wow..) And finally, Sethe's skeletons come out of the closet as she admits attempting to axe murder her three children (while only successfully managing to kill one) to save them from re-capture. This flashback is undoubtedly the worst and obviously most graphic in nature. I personally felt the movie was overlong and wallowed a bit too much in its heir of self-importance.

I'm definitely going to watch it again a few times (and, of course, I'm going to pay attention to the deer scene and look for cars).I have a few comments that weren't yet listed here.One is the symbolism of the rocking chair - a symbol of maternal instincts (a rocking chair connotes images of a mother and child).  The reason Beloved can lift the rocking chair over her head is to symbolize her connection with her mother - her maternal link is what gives her strength and life. Also, when Sethe becomes ill, and Denver is forced to look for work/food, the rocking chair is in the forefront of the scene when she finds a food offering on the tree stump.  The rocking chair is lying face down on the porch, symbolizing the turmoil in the maternal relationship between Denver and Sethe.  When Denver waits outside for Mr. Baldwin, the rocking chair is right again.  She doesn't need the maternal link, and it symbolizes her strength on her own - apart from her mother.Some people have commented that Sethe should not have killed her children, but should have taken that rage and fear and directed it against the white man.  Well, in the end, when she finally raises her ice pick against Mr. Baldwin, and not against her own, does she finally release the ghost of her Beloved.The movie is amazing.

The horrifying scenes of slavery and Sethe's rise to freedom in Ohio would have been much more involving if told in sequence.  The use of flashbacks is not successful.  Oprah Winfrey is satisfactory as Sethe.  Thandie Newton's performance is tremendously mannered and becomes annoying--even, unfortunately, laughable--as the film goes on.  Kimberly Elise is brilliant as Denver, showing that character's conflict and growth.  Best of all is Beah Richards in a luminous performance as Sethe's preaching mother-in-law.

By robbing us of the full slavery sequences and the entire sequence of Paul D's imprisonment in Alfred, Georgia lessen the power of the novel.  The portrayal of Beloved was also extremely odd.

For some reason Sethe is haunted by a malevolent entity. It drives her two sons away but it is driven away by an old friend of Sethe's that comes along named Paul D (Danny Glover). Paul D sticks around and soon becomes Sethe's love interest. Things appear to be turning around for the troubled mother until one day a strange young woman shows up. The kind-hearted Sethe takes her in against Paul D's inclination. Shortly after, things begin to turn upside down in the household and Sethe's dark and ugly past catches up with her. I think the film is an excellent combination of a paranormal thriller and period drama. It's hard enough to create a great film in just one specific genre but combining two or more genres is that much trickier. The director, Jonatahan Demme did an excellent job at adapting Toni Morrison's novel into a full feature film. That's why I really don't understand why Beloved didn't do so well at the box office.From the cinematography to the soundtrack, to the script, and to the casting, everything was well done... (Back to the casting.) I think they nailed it with the casting - from Oprah Winfrey, Danny Glover, Thandie Newton, Kimberly Elise and Irma P. Hall (in a small role) - just about every role was match perfectly. Thandie Newton and Kimberly Elise, both little known at the time, gave excellent performances. I really think Kimberly Elise, like the film itself, is a very underrated, underused actress. She's much better than other Black actresses that seem to get all the good roles like Halle Berry, Sanaa Lathan, and Regina King - yes I said it, even HALLE BERRY! It is also great seeing Oprah in a film (you guys should see The Butler), as it seems she only does parts like once a decade. Her and Danny Glover have great chemistry, and seeing them together in another slavery/segregation period piece, you just know Celie and Shug Avery are gonna pop out any minute and it's going to be The Color Purple II. ***Spoiler Alert*** My only grip is that the film moves a bit slow at times, and I felt the character Amy Denver, a white woman from Boston who stumbles upon a pregnant, injured Sethe in route to her escape from a plantation, is a bit too far-fetched. Amy nurses Sethe's blistering feet and helps Sethe reach the Kentucky side of the Ohio River, where she eventually delivers Sethe's baby. Sethe then names the child after the good Samaritan. Not that I don't believe there were Caucasians sympathetic to the black man's (or woman's) plight back then. Nor do I find it hard to believe the same Caucasians would help a black person to freedom in some way if given the opportunity, but for some reason Amy Denver just seemed so out of place and I don't think the story would have suffered any if the character had been written out. ***End Spoiler Alert*** Anyway, if you haven't seen it by now.

One of its strongest points (and these are countless) is that it is about the period of American history near the end and immediately following slavery, when Negroes were still considered sub-human. It presents the story of the tremendous suffering of a few slaves during that time (and, indeed, during their entire lives), but the important thing is that the book does this with a startlingly small amount of graphic images and direct depictions of violence or cruelty. Because the movie is a visual account of the novel, it is unable to do this.Sethe is a former slave who has suffered more hardships than most human beings (although, given the allusions to life on Sweet Home, she has not suffered even there the most), and the novel is about her life experiences and those of the slaves close to her. The most glaring problem here, which may have been unavoidable, is that Sethe's flashbacks could not be presented in the film in any other way than as brief, shocking images filled with violence and blood. This is not a problem because of anything to do with gratuitous violence, but because in the novel, Sethe lets out brief snapshots of her memories (which are too painful to directly tell as stories of her earlier life) as though she does not quite realize that she's doing it, then immediately stops herself when the pain hits her. The magnitude of her suffering is reduced to split-second sequences of brutality, which are presented as such but with no explanation or hint that they are that short because they are too painful to be any longer.Besides the trouble that arises from having huge Hollywood superstars play the slaves here (which is a negligible fact because the performances are so powerful), the performance of Beloved, the title character, is entirely off the mark. Beloved embodies the epitome of Sethe's painful memories. She is Sethe's daughter (although not the only child) that Sethe was forced to kill to prevent them from going into slavery (thus providing the most significant act that allows us, indeed, FORCES us, to judge her as a person). When she is reborn from the river, she stumbles to 124 Bluestone Road, the house in which the majority of the movie and novel take place, and back into the lives of Sethe and Denver, the daughter that barely escaped the violence of her own mother's hands.The problem with the performance is that, while it's true that Beloved was killed when she was two years old, and has not matured a day since then except physically, she does not act like a two-year-old child. The Beloved in Toni Morrison's novel has the maturity of a two-year-old and the physical, motherly needs of a two-year-old (most evident in her urgent need to be with Sethe), but she does not have the demeanor of one. I am reminded of John Malkovich's performance as Lennie Small in `Of Mice and Men.' Lennie Small is a huge, hulking man in the novel with a miniscule intelligence. He has the intellectual capacity and maybe even some of the same values as a seven or eight-year-old (such as `tenning dem wabbits'), but he doesn't act like one. Thandie Newton remembers in her performance that Beloved was a small child when she died, but she overuses it to the point where she drowns out much of the rest of the effect that she has on the story and those around her. Most importantly, her overdone performance distracts attention from the purpose that she is meant to serve in the story.Beloved is the supernatural element of Toni Morrison's novel, who is there not because this is a supernatural story but because she represents the magnitude of the suffering that went on during slave times. She is a spiritual manifestation that requires no explanation except for her cause of death, and Newton's outlandish performance in the role reduces that effect because her behavior is not explained.The film stays true to the magnitude of sorrow presented in the novel, but it transforms it from the slow, relentless, and immensely complicated version presented in the novel and into one of visuals and performance, which challenges successful actors to present the lives of people who have suffered more than most people alive can imagine. The film succeeds grandly in presenting the society in which Negroes were not humans but property. Sethe did not murder her children, she destroyed property that does not belong to her. But the important thing that is lost here is the shock that is delivered by the subtlety of the content. The emotion of the novel is enormously powerful, and yet it is all so subdued that even white people are almost not in it at all. They are little more than a lumbering presence that never shows its face (except for the single scene in the book that is presented from the point of view of white people), but is always looming dangerously just over the horizon. Beloved is a story that is too powerful to be told directly, because if it is, it will be weakened because the danger and the suffering becomes tangible, something that you can see and then forget about. The short descriptions and bits of events in the book force the mind to circle and work them until the full impact of their true meaning is realized. "},{"Title":"Be warned.

Then, at the end, it has a girl (spirit??) forever disappear in plain view of some 25 people, a girl who has been living with this family for a prolonged period of time.I guess the message is that slavery makes some of its subjects vanish and others to be haunted not only psychologically, but physically and in actuality.

I'm watching this movie because of option B and it helps a LITTLE bit. BUT, I'm going to have to say that the movie had potential to be good until it just kept going and going....Like the book (as much as I've read, anyway), the movie was kind of repetitive and predictable as you go. But the problem I have with it, like I said before, is that it is WAY too long. Since I haven't read the whole thing, I'm going to say that some parts of the movie are confusing. There's no explanation for some things and you just have to make assumptions for yourself.

Beloved is marketed as an epic about the struggle of an ex-slave trying now to lead a normal life in a new, free, land. And that is what it's about... to an extent. What they don't tell you is that it has some pretty bizarre stuff in it too.OK, the film opens in the household of Sethe (Oprah Winfrey), an ex-slave who is raising a daughter, Denver (Kimberly Elise). The house is clearly haunted. Why else would the walls glow red while stuff flies through the air (including the pet dog)? Well, one day a fellow ex-slave, Paul D(played by Danny Glover) shows up in front of Sethes' home and has a talk with her, talking about the old days at sweet home (the plantation on which the two used to work). Sethe invites him into her house and Paul witnesses the whole shebang of spooky stuff, glowing walls and everything. Nevertheless, he decides to stay there, and the two grow closer together.Cut to a river. A lone figure makes her way across, covered from head to toe with bugs. She soon makes her way to Sethe's front yard. Sethe sees her and in what I guess is fear... runs behind the house, crouches, and... well... takes a whiz. OK, now let me stop here for a second and explain one of the key reasons that kept me from completely liking this movie. Sometimes there are images that are there for no other reason than for their shock value. Unlike the violence in Saving Private Ryan (which was clearly there for a reason), these graphic images in Beloved (except for a few) are only there for shock value and do not further the plot in any way. I mean, come on... there are plenty of other ways to show fear then having a woman crouch down and p*** right in front of the camera.Anyway, back to the plot. Sethe takes the young girl in to live with her. The girl is clearly not normal, she has problems moving, yet she can lift a rocking chair over her head with one hand, and her speech is slurred and never completely clear. Sethe asks the girl her name and she simply responds, Beloved.Beloved seems to know a lot about Sethe and seems to be very curious about her past. Through conversation and flashbacks we find that there is indeed a connection between the two that ends up revealing huge pieces of Sethe's dark past, and also answers quite a few of our questions in the process.Now, Beloved is not a great film. To some people it may be, but the weirdness factor doesn't seem to go with the rest of the movie. Another thing is that the film is dragged out... it's about 3 hours total, but trim away many of the unnecessary characters, subplots, and dialogue and it could've been a more effective movie. The film seems to try too hard to prove to you that it's important, and it ultimately makes watching it that much more disappointing.Now there are some plusses in here. The score is excellent and is probably the best film score in a movie so far this year. The cinematography is also worth noting. But what saves this movie from being mediocre are the excellent performances. Oprah Winfrey is truly a talented actress and I would love to see her in more films. Kimberly Elise also was a nice surprise, especially as the film nears its end and she realizes the need to become independent, and Danny Glover is always good.Although Beloved will probably get its share of Oscar nominations this year, it is not in my opinion an Oscar worthy film. It's not really a bad film, but just not as good as it makes itself out to be.

She gives us an in-depth look at what slavery was really like, and leaves the rosy-colored elements out.  Some may view this movie as confusing, others may view it as exaggerated, or over done, but the images that were presented in the movie, however gross they may appear, still do not depict the real life tragedy that many lived as a result of slavery.  So if this movie shocked you,and made you want to walk out perhaps its time to open your eyes and leave your fantastical visions of grandeur at the door.Oprah is truly a talented woman.  She is a realization of the American dream, not only for black people but anyone, but I must ask myself whether or not Oprah truly captivated the essence of Sethe as Toni Morrison depicted her character in the book.  No one doubts Oprah's talent, but perhaps some consideration should have been shown for the artist, Toni Morrison, who created her masterpiece, Beloved.  I feel Morrision's work was compromised by Oprah's overwhelming desire to force herself into this story.

To me it seem liked each writer wished to make a different movie. Those that I talked to who really enjoyed the movie said it was a good adaptation of the book. As someone who has NEVER read this book, I find the piece tedious and dull. That isn't to say there was nothing of redeeming value in this film. The actress who played Denver was thouroughly engaging, as well as the actress who portrayed Beloved. Some of the essentials were done beautifully. Despite these positive points I still left the theatre with a sour feeling towards this film. I was left confused without a character to turn to for help.

God became a human body giving Himself for frightening pain and death on the cross to redeem people who killed him and show in that way the power of his love for them. He didn't want the suffering and pain of his children who are His creations in human bodies, in hell with Satan and his fallen angels for the whole eternity. God has got a plan for every human, that's why he's suffering when someone kills his creation. Only God, not human, is perfect in Its love and only this love has made happened that Jesus his Son couldn't go against his Father during his suffering on Earth. Jesus only told his Father - 'God, God why did you leave me ?' - He has only though He left him alone. God answered nothing. Jesus, who is a God in human body didn't rebel against his Father in opposite to the human being at the beginning of the times. Jesus trusted his Father. Human trusted Satan and that's why human love cannot be perfect. Jesus Christ throughout his sacrifice has given an eternity life for every person, who truly wants it and regrets his own sins even if it is a murderer because he promised that on the cross and in many other situations. Sethe without any doubt had got her hands in scarlet. She has just thought she had loved her children very much, that's why she tried to kill them, but she really regretted her act against children's life. The proof of it is that Sethe wanted to serve her survived daughter. She wanted to take care and spend with evil Beloved all the time. The young strange woman has appeared in the house when the devilish spirit of the death daughter had calmed. That was the sign the evil spirit became a body. After all there is no possibility to compare the death of Sethe's child to the death of God's Son. That's the reason, the context of these deaths is completely different and contrary. God has sacrificed his own child, his perfect love for life of many sinners, in addition with the agreement of Jesus, but this woman sinned against this perfect love, taking back a life of her child, a child of God as well. God has forgiven Sethe's murder like he said and the proof of this is that the woman named Beloved has disappeared when old Christian women had made an exorcism. They were standing by the house praying and singing in the name of Jesus Christ. It was some kind of Christian exorcism and it seemed to be successful. Jesus went to Sethe and set her free from the evil past. Sethe said 'You cannot love much and you cannot love less. You just can love or not'. Well, I agree, but our love will never be perfect in this life from the point of view of Christianity and from my point of view. So I can say 'Sethe, you have no idea what the real love is'.

It made me appreciate the fact that I live in a more civilized world in which you are not discriminated only because of the color of your skin. I mean, when such an occurrence does take place, it is officially disapproved and not considered to be normal.Apart from this, the main character demonstrates extremely strong love to her children. However, her former experiences had made her seriously insane. Sethe (Oprah Winfrey) tries to protect them in every possible way, even if her actions are utterly irrational to normal people. Her tragedy is shown in a shocking and somehow touching manner. The supernatural phenomena, amazing music, and extraordinary Thandie Newton's acting (as Beloved) create a stunning impression that will leave no viewer unaffected.I definitely do not recommend this film to those who 'just feel like watching something'.

She escaped Sweethome and found other work with a much friendlier boss, where she proved to be a good worker.Eighteen years after leaving Sweethome, Sethe's past comes back to haunt her when a fellow Sweethome slave, played by Lethal Weapon's Danny Glover, reappears in her life.

After much toting pre-release buzz (from the filmakers and the studio), in the end received muted favor from the notices, and was DOA at the box office. Not much aided by the lambasting it took from fans of Toni Morrison's novel.So I'll be truthful, considering these factors, I too put put  Beloved on the backburner. A film I did want to see however, with all the creative talent involved.I finally found myself getting behind the apathy, and braved a viewing for myself. And while enjoying the film on acting and technical merits, I have to say the film felt somewhat  unfulfilled in what it set out to do. Which is to tell the life of those rebuilding lives after abolition, and leaving behind the sins of desperaton in those trying times. All the uncanny elements are a slight too prominent in this story, eroding dramatic believibility and becomes a heavy ghost story. Now a  damn fine ghost story, but unbecoming to this particular tale.The story begins in 1865, and we see an average country home,  humble in appearance, maybe what most would envision when thinking of one. Well come inside, and the home and its inhabitants are being ravaged by a paranormal attack of the orneryiest kind. Mother Sethe (Oprah Winfrey) tends to the damage rather nonchalantly, so this would be a frequent occurrence. While her sons are at wits end, and flee their abode, leaving behind she and her daughter to the ever  ill-maligned spirit. Cut to eight years later Sethe and daughter Denver (Kimberly Elise) still tolerating the nasty spirit, life goes on. The  story soon introduces Paul D (Danny Glover), a man who is a huge part of Sethe's past and the memory of Sweet Home, the  plantation where they once resided. Sethe welcomes him into her home and to the chagrin of Denver, exchange memories of their time spent there. A vile paranormal attack ensues, seemingly meant for Paul D, in effect of the fondness he and Sethe share.  Paul D's resistance to the force drives the spirit away for the meantime.Enter one probable reincaration of the spirit, a woman who  arrives at their household, who is the best represention of the term born yesterday. A bug plagued infant-woman who seems to resemble more of a painting than an actual person. In her best Linda Blair, she presents herself as Beloved (Thandie Newton; a skin-crawling debut mind you). The same title of the daughter Sethe murdered, to keep from the hands of slave owners long  ago. The specter that may be at unease in her home. After which  she becomes a part of the household, where her selfish motives begin manifesting themselves.Now the translating of book to film as we all should know by now, is a throughly unrewarding process. One would like to have most of text covered in respect of the prose it was borrowed from. This seems to have been taken in to mind in light of this film, whereas leading to one of its flaws... overlength. Not to  beat this dead horse again, not every aspect in the story is important to the film. Particulary in the third act where it is truly felt. Director Jonathan Demme has crafted himself a beautiful escape if you will. Yet he seems to cater to the bizarre repugancies of the story, showing an interest in warts-in-all over a so-close sumptuous moviegoing experience. The character of Beloved is spooky for sure, but at times comes dangerously close to being parody fodder. Almost nulling the tragedy that befell her in the past. I will note however a well reserved performance by Oprah, who had every reason to degrade into gospel stageplay hamfest.  In the back of my mind I knew when she took on this project, it would be an excuse to rehash and exploit her role in The Color  Purple. Thankfully it isn't, the Oprah persona seems to melt away in the cool remoteness of Sethe.Beloved is a haunting exercise in mainstream filmmaking by today's standards. Dwelling in repellent imagery... yes. But in this film no one looks to be tortured by their past as they should be. Which is too bad, being the theme of the film is that of being haunted, a theme which is made too literal here, making it's nightmarish fury only cosmetic. After watching this, will the disturbing visuals and oddities of the nature of  this story stay with you, or will you want to wash them off? A  half-recommendation.  "},{"Title":"Beloved  The film whose pages never came to life","Date":"18 November 1998","Score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama, History, Horror","Review":"  Though director Johnathan Demme did a decent job with his difficult film adaptation of Toni Morrison's Pulitzer Prize winning novel Beloved, the answer to the question of whether or not this book can successfully be adapted for the screen has only been strengthened for the argument that it can not.  In spite of how closely Demme followed the plot of Beloved, much of the story is left out.  The novel contains thoughts behind the actions, which reveal character and help to tell the story.  It is these thoughts juxtaposed with the characters' actions, in my opinion, that makes the novel such a success.  It allows the reader to see how characters, Sethe and Denver most specifically, react to and because of their actions.  And for the most part, this is totally missed in the film, for two main reasons that I see.First, as much as I like Oprah Winfrey and as proud as I am of her in chasing her dreams in playing Sethe and helping to produce this novel that is apparently so close to her heart, she is not the caliber of actor necessary for such a part.  To make Beloved work on screen, Johnathan Demme needed to have an amazing performance from a great actress who could show the audience a world about Sethe in a single shot, in a close-up of her eyes perhaps.  Ones that come to mind who are successful in this are Jack Nicholson (especially in Terms of Endearment, One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, A Few Good Men, and As Good as it Gets) and Meryl Streep (especially in Out of Africa, Kramer vs. Kramer, and Silkwood).  The audience can feel exactly how these characters are feeling, and for that crucial instant, forget they are actually watching actors, and feel as though they are seeing the characters.  Unfortunately for Demme and the entire Beloved production team, Oprah Winfrey is just not one of these actors.  Watching Oprah play Sethe is like watching a woman who really loves the character Sethe, rather than watching Sethe.  Flashes of brilliance come from the two young actresses who play Beloved and Denver, Thandie Newton and Kimberly Elise, who clearly upstage Winfrey in all aspects of acting.  Side Note Demme's most well-known successes, 1992 Best Picture Silence of the Lambs and Philadelphia had the likes of Best Actress, Jodie Foster, Best Actor, Sir Anthony Hopkins, and Best Actor, Tom Hanks acting in front of the camera. Apparently when it comes to Demme's films, the proof is in the pudding.Second, much of the failure of the film adaptation is due to the manner in which Morrison's story, Beloved, is told.  Great accuracy with the plot is no excuse for the absence of her artistic achievement.  Morrison's characters' thoughts are left out in many crucial places and feelings often appear forced, much of which occurs due to editing.  One example that comes to mind, is the scene in which Paul D convinces Sethe to bring Denver and go to the carnival with him to spend his two dollars.  In the movie, Winfrey says, I don't know, smiles ever so slightly, turns and walks away.  Not bad, if Demme gives the audience some time to see the smile and how happy Sethe is that Paul D is there with her, the way the book does.  Not even close.  As soon as she turns to walk away, the audience is treated to one of the umpteen-hundred fade-to-blacks that extends and chops-up the already long film.  The book reads, 'No' is what she said.  At least what she started out saying (what would her boss say if she took a day off?), but even when she said it she was thinking how much her eyes enjoyed looking in his face.  My point is evident On screen, the effect is missed.  It is these omissions of crucial character development through thoughts and intangibles that both Winfrey's acting and Demme's direction fail to address, leaving the audience cheated out of Morrison's wonderfully told story.  I understand my suggestion to make the film longer to include necessary components of the story should be made with caution, for the movie nearly surpasses that epic mark of 180 minutes.  However, Beloved won a Pulitzer Prize, and I am pretty sure there is no asterisk by it in the record books saying that it had too many words; they were all necessary.Which brings me to my final point, that being the argument against making this story into a movie.  Make no mistake, it is a difficult story to tell, on-screen or off, but Morrison's writing of the characters' thoughts and feelings is such an essential part of the story in my mind, that it absolutely should have been included.  It should have been shown either through acting, the harder of the two methods, or possibly through a voice-over. When I read Beloved, I heard the narrator speaking, and though a voice-over narration to supplement acting is sometimes considered weak in filmmaking, I think Beloved was a perfect film for it.  If I had a quarter for every time I wanted to hear Maya Angelou's voice start come over the loudspeaker revealing the poetic thoughts of Sethe, I could have retired by the film's end.  A beautiful, recognizable narration by long-time Winfrey friends Angelou or even Morrison herself (for publicity's sake alone) would have been a valuable asset to the film, and possibly spared Touchstone, Demme, and Winfrey the embarrassment it will ensue.

Sadly, Oprah (who was so wonderful in The Color Purple) gives an inconsistent performance that might indicate that she didn't understand the character she was playing.  Of course, the director (Jonathan Demme) could have stepped in and assisted her, but few people will probably challenge this powerful woman in anything she does or says.

Although there are some problems with its screenplay and editing, by the end of the film moviegoers will find that the movie, which is three hours long, was worthy of every minute of their time.Beloved is the story of Sethe, a woman trapped in the circumstances of her time and who is haunted by the past.  Although my overall impression of the film was a positive one, I have two main criticisms.In parts, the screen play lacks focus. For instance, far too much screen time was devoted to the development of the relationship between Paul D (Danny Glover) and Sethe (Oprah Winfrey).  One wonders if some of this time could not have been better spent on other scenes that would have made the film far less confusing. Perhaps a few more scenes in Sweet Home would have help viewers develop a greater appreciation for the revulsion that Sethe and the other slaves felt towards the place. Perhaps a few scenes exploring when apparitions first appeared in Sethe's household (or the general theme of spirituality) would have helped to make the entire ghost subplot more plausible and less confusing.Additionally, poor editing throughout the movie really distracts from the experience of viewing the film. Although creative play with chronological sequencing can sometimes bring a lot to a movie (e.g., Pulp Fiction), I thought that in this film its use contributed nothing to the story line and at times was very distracting. There were too many flashbacks. Finally, I can think of a few scenes that I thought seemed to come out of no where. For instance, I still have not figured out what was the significance of Sethe's peeing scene after the fair.Despite these two criticisms, I must admit that I loved the film.  I found myself thinking about it frequently, days after I saw it.  I found myself constantly revisiting moral questions posed by the film.   Oprah Winfrey, Danny Glover, Thandie Newton, and Kimberly Elise all deliver first rate performances that kept me tied to my chair.  Thandie Newton and Kimberly Elise were especially spellbinding.  Newton's interpretation of Beloved was courageous and complex.  On the other hand, Elise as Denver was irresistible.Beloved is a cut above the cookie cutter Hollywood film.

Besides that rather ominous complaint, I found the films use of bodily fluids and projectile rejections far more than just disconcerting. They were down right unnecessary and morbidly grotesque. I understand what Director J. Demme was trying to convey, that is, a sense of grueling and depravity in spirit. But it comes off as a cheap parlor trick meant to shock the audience into understanding the power of a film that always seems more keenly aware of it's own magnitude than we ever do. The performances are strong, save for Thandie Newtons embarrassingly feeble attempt at depth in the title roll. By the end of the film, you are so ready for her to shut up and cease with her rolling bodily hums that her disappearance is more treasured for it's merciful realization than it's ties and effects on the afflicted characters. This film was also far too long at 2hrs 51 minutes. Perhaps worst of all i left the film with very little sympathy for any of the characters, who all seem vague, weightless and morally ambiguous. Earns a second star for a scant few scenes whose mise' en scene were all together striking.

Fill-in-the-blanks melodrama moves along fluidly, yet intrinsically keeps tripping itself up. Director Jonathan Demme wants the overstuffed tale to unfold slowly, but by explaining so little about the central characters he risks alienating viewers. Within the first ten minutes, Demme employs a technical effect which looks (and plays) cheap, followed by an outpouring of sorrowful family anger which gets the first act off on the wrong foot. The narrative is, in fact, so fuzzy that we're not sure who Oprah Winfrey's character is, how she makes her living, or what her relationship is with her daughter (who appears disturbed). When the stranger Beloved is readily welcomed by Winfrey into the home, talking in a staccato sing-song, we're not told why. Demme seems to think the mood music and the haunted/loving expression on Winfrey's face will tell us what we need to know, but this backfires (the film is practically intent on shutting out logic, replacing it with soul-bearing emotion). Perhaps in an attempt to retain Morrison's prose, the screenwriters don't allow these people to have normal conversations (it's all steeped in the hypothetical). Beloved has an interesting pictorial look, although the cinematography by Tak Fujimoto is too clear and pristine (as was The Color Purple, for example), and the tidy yards and weathered rooms look too Hollywood. Demme darts about avoiding explanations, while Thandie Newton's Beloved skitters about like a banshee. Winfrey, who also co-produced the movie, gives an uneven performance hindered by the dialogue; her lack of sparkle reminds us she can be a gravely intelligent presence, but her solemn looks of longing don't register anything intriguing (we're supposed to be drawn to this woman because of Winfrey's personality, I assume, yet with Oprah so subdued we're left with nothing but a skin-deep portrait). It's a large-scale failure, a misbegotten venture, with eyes rimmed with tears, mouths torn by grief, hands grasping and clutching.

It was brutal, and the film doesn't shy away from it. This is what makes this film so great it shows how slavery dehumanized both the slaves and the slave owners, and wrecked families afterward.Most of the complaints I've heard or read about the film are (when you strip away the quibbling) because people freaked out when they saw how graphically slavery was portrayed. What did they expect?? Bottom line The images of slavery ARE disturbing, and also completely realistic. Jonathan Demme was right not to downplay it.Danny Glover and Kimberly Elise are great, and Beah Richards (as Baby Suggs, the preacher) is incredible. I also like that they used some historic landmarks like the old Pennsylvania Turnpike (a dirt road from the 1800s, portions of which still exist) for the large road that appears in several scenes.

Going into this movie, I had a general idea of what Toni Morrisson's original book was about and thus, knew the tone would be dark and brutal. I found it to be an incredibly powerful and well-done movie. Yes, it was brutal, bloody and unyielding, but hello, this is a film about slavery and the effects it has on the human psyche. And yes, that is brutal, bloody and unyielding. I didn't find the story difficult to follow, it unfolds with day-to-day life, interspersed with flashbacks. The flashbacks don't reveal the whole story, however, as when truly horrible things happen in your life, let alone throughout your life, you're not just going to sit down at the table and pour it all out. The film's story is much more of a character study than a straightforward this-this-and-finally-this plot.I always find it amazing the reaction many Americans have to films about slavery. It's not just my name is Kunta Kinte and I don't know nothing about birthing no babies. It is horrible, tragic and demeaning. And the comments complaining about the white characters being sadistic and unlikeable and formulaic, would this be a good time to point out again that it's a film about slavery and its effects? It's not about the white characters and for once it's nice to see a film about black history without a random sympathetic white character stuck in it just to make it more palatable for some viewers (think of Rosewood and Glory as two quick examples of this. Both excellent films, but suffering from this problem.)Overall, I found this to be a deeply moving film, one that stuck with me long afterwords&#133;.but then I'm only 5 or 6 generations out of slavery myself. The performances are exceptional, insomuch that they are restrained (instead of the overacting that the subject matter might have lent itself to). The direction is suitably brooding, with beautiful and ominous shots to heighten the otherworldliness of Beloved (particularly the scene in the dark with Denver) and the bleakness of Sethe's life.

Unfortunately, that book is difficult to bring to life. Like most great works, it is subtle and inexplicit, inviting the reader to think and wonder. Is Beloved really the missing daughter in the flesh, a supernatural being, a manifestation of Sethe's guilt, an imposter? The book leaves plenty of room for reader interaction. The movie chose to make her a fully realized corporeal entity, and the director and actress chose to have her play the role as kind of a serious version of Jerry Lewis. She talks in a mentally-impaired Linda Blair Exorcist voice, and moves as if unable to control her hands and feet. In effect the movie tells us precisely and exactly what Beloved is like, something the book left us more room to picture on our own, and frankly, I didn't much care for the image they chose. I think many who loved the book will feel the same way.Secondly, the book is deeply mystical, and uses a complex interweaving of timescapes, together with a jumble of interior monologues, blocked memories, reality, manufactured memories, and the supernatural/mystical. The book uses these elements effectively, because certain characters have to discover the truth about certain events in the same way the reader does, or the technique will not produce the desired effect. It is difficult to translate this into film, although this film does quite a good job, in my opinion. Unfortunately, that extends the running time substantially.What do we have left? A movie unable to please those who loved the book, and generally far too complicated and somber for those who are unfamiliar with the book.Forget the merit of the movie for a minute - who did they think would be the audience? The intellectuals who loved the book? That's a pretty small potential audience to build on, and the film is obviously not designed for the mass market.Therefore, the movie was doomed to disappoint viewers and those who invested in it.Is it a bad movie? Hell, no. It is a good story, powerfully told. It is fundamentally decent. It is well photographed, well acted (reluctantly, I admit Oprah is terrific), and I liked the score. Oprah and her production company are to be thanked for bringing such a treasure to the screen. I just hope they weren't planning on a profit.I'm one of the few who liked it, but I liked it a lot. It paints a picture of the difficulty of good people to keep their moral compasses in extraordinary times. The period of slavery and the American Civil War probably dislocated more moral magnetic norths than any other time I can think of, and it was a struggle to keep on the level of humanity and civilization that we humans think we have achieved. I felt the movie made this point movingly. I do think it was more difficult to relate to Sethe's strongest actions without a harsher pictorialization of the hardships she endured and expected her children to endure, but I really am not convinced this was a flaw at all. The picture chose subtlety over melodrama, and perhaps that was a good choice.

The characters are unforgettable and the story, with its haunting surreal quality, will linger long in my mind.I read the book and found it difficult to read. Translated to film, however, the story works, and I found myself intrigued and interested in the tale set in 1873 of former slaves, making a new life for themselves and still living with the horror of the past.Hooray for Danny Glover.  He is outstanding in the part of Paul D, the former slave who comes courting Sethe, played by Oprah Winfrey, who is living with the effects of one horrible act of desperation. Oprah brings her presence to the film and is a good actress.  Alas, though, perhaps it is because she is so very very well-known, she was always more Oprah  to me than the character she was playing.The transitions and flashbacks within the film are seamless, so much so that I didn't realize until the list of credits rolled, that the part of Sethe as a younger woman was played by a different actress, Lisa Gay Hamilton.  She is in the scenes that give the movie its dramatic punch and drive the story and her acting is outstanding.  If Oprah gets nominated for an academy award I certainly hope that Lisa Gay Hamilton is not forgotten.At almost three hours the movie is too long.  Some of the middle could have been honed down.  Sethe's daughter, Denver, played by Kimberly Elise and the strange young woman visitor named Beloved, played by Thandie Newton, have many scenes together.  The audience guesses, long before the characters do, as to exactly who Beloved is, and there are much too many scenes illustrating the same points.  While played beautifully by the  two young actresses, a few less examples would have served the movie better.Beloved is the story of some troubled people told against a historical background that has never been really done well in a film before.  Its a somber story, with not a bit of comic relief to relieve the tension that keeps mounting.  It is also a classic tale of sin and punishment and, finally, a sort of redemption.  Recommended.  But be forewarned that you will not come out of the theater smiling.

And yet this is not a victim story, it's a story of choice and love and what the human spirit is capable of when faced with the most horrible and unthinkable of circumstances.  It's about survival with conviction and knowledge of true freedom.  I came away feeling reminded of how many people of all races today allow themselves to be enslaved with invisible chains, by two of the worst oppressors of all  fear and self-doubt.Oprah is great and really holds it together, powerfully brings Sethe to life heart and soul, but it's Kimberly Elise who steals the show as Sethe's daughter, Denver. She really has something special and I look forward to seeing her in more movies. (and no, she's not a relative or friend, I've never met her...) Danny Glover, as always, was wonderful and Beah Richards is absolutely mesmerizing.The only downside was the portrayal of Beloved by Thandie Newton.  She looked hauntingly ethereal and perfect for the role, but as the spirit of a toddler in a young woman's body, the translation was very distracting and detracted from the mood.

But then Jonathan Demme has made brilliant films before and he was obviously the right choice of director for this production.Beloved (the movie) is lavish, colorful, and intriguing.  The cast is brilliant and the script is faithful to Toni Morrison's vision.  In fact, this film is about as faithful to a novel as any I have ever seen a few important scenes are left out, but one can hardly blame Demme considering how long that would have made an already lengthy movie.But what really makes Beloved click is the atmosphere that Demme creates through his camera angles, color schemes (which are faithful to Morrison's), and attention to detail.  Characters are allowed to look ugly, to do disgusting things, and to show real pain and sorrow.  What a breath of fresh air compared to the usual glamorization that comes with a Hollywood flick. And after all, this is a movie about sadness.  That tone is set right away when Paul D. first comes to the house at 142 and senses the ghost.  Sethe tells him it is not evil, just sad.To put it another way, this movie is as moving as Schindler's List, as darkly sad as Fargo.  However, what amazes me is how uplifting the film also manages to be, with Baby Suggs' sermon being the last word.Granted, the film is missing some of the finer scenes of the novel (Stamp Paid's soliloquoy; the slave days at Sweet Home).  But what Demme and Winfrey do is give the story over to the women, and in some ways, I think that it is rightfully theirs.Now some will say that the movie is too convoluted, and too intense, for the average audience.  I say to that that should be a criticism of the lack of sophistication of American audiences, not of a film that reaches the level of art.  After all, what rule is there to state that a film should not be viewed more than once, or that it must be so simple that it takes only one viewing to be fully appreciated?  Maybe Beloved will start a trend of films that ask more of their audiences.  That is what great movies should be about anyway.

This presents a number of problems for the would-be director, in this case the often brilliant Jonathan Demme. One of the main issues in turning a Gothic story into a film, is that Gothic stories are inherently ambiguous. The book describes the ghost of Beloved moving things and throwing things around in the house, but it leaves the reader with a sense of not knowing to which degree these things are actually happening. At the end of the novel (spoiler alert), for instance, the reader cannot be quite sure what exactly happens with Beloved, whether she was actually a ghost, etc. This ambiguity does not translate well to the film version, where the viewer actually sees (through crude special effects) Beloved's image flickering and vanishing. This takes a lot of the punch out of the ending for me, and is why I like the realistic elements of the story much more in the film version (Spoiler For instance when Sethe is found in the shed having killed her daughter, a very powerful scene).It also presents a challenge for the actors, specifically the one playing the ghost returning to haunt the family, which leaves me to my biggest gripe with the film I did not like Thandie Newton's portrayal of Beloved at all. I don't know what to criticize exactly. Beloved is supposed to look dazed and speak incoherently, but Thandie Newton often comes across as comical rather than frightening, especially in conjunction with the poor special effects, which seem very dated already. She is bizarre, but not haunting in the way that Morrison's character is supposed to be.Viewers who have not read the book might find themselves confused and turned off by what is really a bizarre story that simply does not work as well in the film medium. Viewers who have read it might find it, like me, a film that only rarely captures the essence of Morrison's novel, while losing much of its haunting ambiguity and visceral emotion. There is a lot of sexual depravity, violence and rape in the novel, which has not been emphasized to the same degree in the film, making it less provocative than, in my opinion at least, it should have been.What we're left with is a flawed picture, but not one I would know exactly how to fix.

This one tells the story of Sethe (Oprah Winfrey), a former slave in 1877 Ohio who many years earlier killed her daughter (Thandie Newton) rather than let the girl get sold into slavery. The girl's aura has haunted Sethe's house ever since. But things might be different now that Sethe's former lover Paul (Danny Glover) has arrived.When the movie came out, a review said that the cinematography made the house look like it was moving. I would agree with that. I would also add that much of the movie might make you feel like your blood is freezing. But there is an element of hope at the end, we hear some people talking about Jesus, but it could be any Jesus (maybe they're returning to their African roots). Although I compared Beloved to Sophie's Choice, I would say that this one is better, in that she's stronger.Anyway, this is a movie that I recommend to everyone. We Americans have an obligation to deal with our racist history, and this movie shows it. Also starring Kimberly Elise, Beah Richards, Irma P. Hall (of The Ladykillers), Jason Robards, and even Wes Bentley in a small role.Oh, and by the way, I saw this the same day that I saw Shadrach, which also deals with slavery.

I had no idea that she would ever be more than just a good actress; she is remarkable.Beloved is that rare film which is both brutal and tasteful, which ultimately offers hope without cheap sentimentality.

It is enough to give one hope for the future of American movies.I am thoroughly disappointed that this movie did not do better at the box office, and by the comments of so many in this forum that it is too long, or boring, or confusing. Never once was I less than riveted to the screen; never once was I lost by what was going on. At the risk of sounding snobbish, I can only guess that comments like those are coming from people who're unaccustomed to anything more complex than prime-time TV drama. The rewards of allowing yourself to be fully engaged by an ambitious film liked Beloved are enormous.Lastly, a technical note an earlier comments referred to seeing boom mikes (and in one case, cars) on the upper half of the screen. It was the only comment that mentioned it. Unfortunately, that person clearly went to a theater where the wrong matte (or no matte) had been installed in the projector. All movies have stray images in the upper and lower areas of the film frame (which is roughly square) which are supposed to be matted out in projection, which gives you the more rectangular screen shape.

With that in mind, I would draw a parallel between `Beloved' and Streisand's `Prince of Tides,' another film that could not capture the epic sprawl of the original novel, but which stood quite well on its own as a movie.In `Beloved,' director Jonathan Demme, actors Oprah Winfrey, Danny Glover, and the serendipitously cast Thandie Newton create a wholly absorbing story about former slaves just after the Civil War.  In it, Winfrey's character, Sethe, encounters both the ordinary and the paranormal as she contends with a particularly haunting event from her past.  `Beloved' is a drama, a love story, a history, a mystery, and a supernatural thriller of the highest order.  Tak Fujimoto's photography is fertile and radiant.  Be forewarned--this is a pretty intense film.  I was uncomfortable (the good kind of uncomfortable that you felt when watching Seven or Silence of the Lambs) for most of the movie.  This approximately three-hour film is charged with symbolism, and moves in a non-sequential fashion, so be patient.  It pays off.

Also, Lisa Gay Hamilton as the younger Sethe (Winfrey plays the elder Sethe) is incredible, but probably won't gain the attention she deserves because when people think of Sethe's impact, Winfrey will get all of the credit.

It was also refreshing to see White characters at a minimum in the film because it's not about their role in slavery, it's about the human suffering that took place.

Up until this film, he was mainly known for great--if unspectacular--films. Something Wild, Philadelphia, and Silence of the Lambs come to mind. Beloved erased any doubts about his veracity as a director. He took a very, very complex book and, gratefully, unusually, did not dumb down the story. This is filmmaking with a mission--a take-it-or-leave it approach that succeeds because it has the courage of its convictions and the brass balls it proudly wears.This is not a film for everyone, however. It is deeply complicated with a plot that is decidedly non-linear. The film shifts, alternately, from nightmare to reality to dreamstate with equal ease with little to no distinction. Perhaps if you had read the book, you might get some of this. But, if you hadn't (as I had not) unless you are an extremely seasoned cinephile, your may not appreciate or grasp its highly cinematic language and tone.Many would say this is elitist filmmaking. And to that, I would say they're right. This is Demme's Moby Dick. And, appropriately, it made no money and disappeared from our multiplex landscape quicker than you can say Toni Morrison. In future years, Demme's masterpiece will be recognized for what it is and amazing, brave film.There are scenes that will haunt you as long as you look at movies. Scenes that echo a brave new world of a director at the top of his craft. Unfortunatly, this bravery seems to have cost him (Demme) some pull in that he hasn't made a film in four years, now. Like Kurosawa or Kubrick before him, it matters not that you have suffered defeat in the eyes of an disinterested public and empty movie theaters, but that you stood your ground and made the best film possible.

This movie really strips bear the cruelty of slavery, and the burden that former slaves, and their descendents carried, and still carry. If you are not interested in confronting that, you won't want to see this movie. Frankly, this is a movie for people with minds willing and capable of looking beyond the screen into deep and painful issues.The character of Sethe is such a perfect example of Post Traumatic Stress Disorder!! She is finally free of slavery, but inside she will probably never recover from the cruelty she suffered. The character of Beloved is a perfect example of the anger and sorrow that lingers in some African Americans. Destroying her own home, and her loving mother, she rages on and on. In contrast, we have Denver, who is strong, and keeps going. She confronts her fears and finds a way to carry on. She refuses to keep the painful secret hidden, and reaches out to her community for help. She represents the positive aspects of African Americans. There were some spectacularly creepy moments in this film (when Beloved first croaks out her name), some incredibly painful moments, some joyful moments, some beauty, some harsh reality. Oprah was wonderful. She acted superbly throughout. I am so tired of people insulting her just because she is black, not skinny, and extremely successful. Ever notice that nobody ever calls John Goodman J-Pig???Another crime is that Oprah did not win an Oscar for this film. That Halle Barry's performance as a completely powerless woman won the first oscar for a black woman is very telling....If you are ready for an incredibly touching and memorable journey into American history and the psychology of pain, WATCH THIS FILM!!!

The 'thirty-women' were fantastic and Sethe's mother was strong and believable.The insights into the details of these former slaves lives gave me a better appreciation of the terrible hardships and travails they had to endure. The minutae of their daily lives, their family, heartaches, the gut wrenching cruelty of slavery (usually only peripherally portrayed in movies) love won and lost...definitely worth my time, money and hours of reflection.

To watch this film without reading the book is like trying to do a crossword without the clues, but it is possible. For those of you attempting to do this, do yourself a favor- grab a cup of coffee, and an in-depth plot summary before you head to the theater. You must know at least a little something of the story before you take part in this incredibly accurate novel portrayal.Morrison crafted her novel, like all great writers, to be inter-active, giving and taking from the reader. The same thing is true of a gut-wrenching film like this one. Throughout the entire viewing experience, and even after I left the theater, I felt like there was a terrible, Beloved-like ghost in my stomach. The camera work is excellent in this greatly artistic film. The low-angle shots moving through the snow and the graveyard at the beginning of the action denormalize the feeling of the rest of the story. You know from that point on, your usual reactions to what you see on the screen will betray you. If you are patient with the story, and are able to pick out the clues that are only given on a need to know basis, you will have found a film that has the ability to gently touch your deepest fears of the past.

Although the movie was just under three hours long, it touched me in a way that I cannot fully understand or explain. The scenery was wonderful, the acting superb, and the story-line was not confusing at all for me. I didn't get a chance to read the book, but if you are not an open-minded free-thinker, then this movie is not for you. At times brutal and unrelenting, this movie, aside from Amistad, lends another view to the complexity and diversity of the African-American experience in this country.Referring to a comment that was earlier posted, there were some good white people in the film. How about the woman that helped Sethe give birth to Denver(whom she also named her after, might that I add), and who turned to give Denver a helping hand when she needed it for her mother?All in all, it can be said that it takes a very brave person to look in himself or herself in the eye and say,  I can look at this and understand that slavery evidently left a lasting impact on this proud woman's mind which might have caused her to do some inhumane things without trying to tone down, or make less of the horrible oreal that African-Americans went through.

It taught me so much about healing. I was very pleased because of the fact that they did not sugar-coat the story and wrote a Hollywood ending. This movie is to be watched with an open mind. It is a movie that makes the viewers reflect. People get overly critical and form an opinion with too much ease. I really believe that this movie will not leave anyone feeling untouched. There is pure magic to this film! I would not get surprised that in the future we actually refer to it as a masterpiece. Go see it and recommend it to your friends.

You need to see this movie in the right frame of mind.  This is not a movie about slaves and slavery.  It is about relationships.  Relationships between mother and daughter, sister and sister, the dead and the living.  It is a phenomenally successful movie on all accounts.  True, the movie does slow down at points but it is necessary to carry it on to the next scene.  You need to think to see this movie. It's not something you let pass over you, like 'Saving Private Ryan' it provokes deep emotions in you.  It is violent and difficult to watch, but like Ryan it will give you much more than what you went in with.

The casting is brilliant.  Oprah Winfrey does a great job as Sethe, a former slave.  You feel her pain and strength.  Danny Glover, as always, is a wonderful actor.  The supporting cast (Kimberly Elise and Thandie Newton) are good actors and I think are new comers that have a bright future. This is a movie that you MUST see the opening scene.  Without going into detail, this scene is pivotal to understanding the rest of the movie. Through flashbacks, we are told Sethe's story to understand where she is now and why.  I enjoyed seeing Oprah Winfrey and Danny Glover acting together as much as I did in The Color Purple.

I viewed it in English class after reading the novel, and it just helped to confirm the strength of the novel. This was a very hard movie to make considering all the elements of the novel that needed to be included, but Demme and the actors did an amazing job portraying these elements. For anyone who has seen the movie and does not understand parts of it, I would highly recommend reading the novel, as it brings out parts of the novel that could not possibly have been portrayed with their full power and meaning in the movie. While viewing the film, I can fully understand how it may be difficult to understand certain sections, as the significance can not be portrayed except through the written word. This is still an amazing movie despite its few minor flaws, and I congratulate Demme for making such a movie from such a book.

Jonathan Demme gets outstanding performances from Oprah Winfrey, Danny Glover, Thandie Newton, and Beah Richards, along with an Oscar-winning performance from Kimberly Elise.  The cast convincingly brings to light both the sufferings of human tragedy the euphoria of human unity as sculpted by Toni Morrison.  The perfomances were incredibly motivating and engaging.  For me, the talent in this movie took character development to another level. Cinematically, Jonathan Demme and company prove themselves again to be masters in the buisness.  Tak Fujimoto's dexterity at telling the story visually through the eyes of the characters brings the character's adversity to light like no other.  The 19th century setting in Ohio/Kentucky is truly beautiful to watch.  This movie does justice to the novel, and will be remembered for a long time to come.

(To cal it visually stunning would be a gross understatement.)  I was intimidated by the nearly three hour running time - when I saw it on video the time flew by me before I even had the chance to catch my breath from the startling opening scene.Beloved is not entertainment, it is a mind-altering experience, in that it challenges many of your beliefs that you thought were set in stone - about life (how delicate it is), about love (the violence of its fierceness), even about the paranormal (the power of that which you cannot see).This movie is extremely difficult to watch - and ultimately extremely rewarding.  Exhausting, yet rejuvenative. I challenge anyone to watch this film and NOT flinch at least a dozen times.Yes, it is difficult to watch.  Yes, it is upsetting.  That being said though... I believe that this film is one of the greatest pieces of American Cinema EVER.I encourage any and everyone to see this film and be challenged by it - it will open windows in your soul that may otherwise have remained shut.In a word, beautiful.  "},{"Title":"A brilliant ghost story, that in fact, it´s much, much more...","Date":"16 June 2000","Score":"0 out of 6 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama, History, Horror","Review":"  I read somewhere, that this movie was a flop in the States, and now after i´ve seen this, i´m more convinced that a flop in America is always a good indication that the movie is going to be an excelent and original movie. But i can see why it failled there, first it´s a very crude movie in its graphic depiction of some scenes. Even the more normal everyday scenes are not the usual politicaly correct ones, from a filming perspective. This is not a politicaly correct movie at all and by doing that it stays true to its story and specialy to its atmosphere wich is incredible, but at the same time makes this filme very hard to classify within a genre. BELOVED is another one of those movies that must be hell to publicize in America. Is it a drama ? An horror movie ? A supernatural thriller ? An historical drama ? Well it´s all of that and nothing of that at the same time. But sure is creepy and very disturbing at times. By the end of it i was still in shock, not from the tension and almost movie magic, but for having just seen one of the most original  stories i ever seen lately. One thing is for sure. I´m going to read the original novel !The first seconds of the movie are a rush, and we clearly get the idea that we are going to see something we didn´t expected. And talking about politacaly incorrect, that initial scene with the dog, is enough to make most people leave the room imediately. Particulary the ones who thought BELOVED was going to be THE COLOR PURPLE part II, wich is not ! Believe me.This movie is very hard to describe tough.  It´s a period drama, wich deals with slavery in the 1800´s inside rural America, but by telling a story of slaves and ex-slaves, goes into a very original ghost story territory that i never seen anywhere before i saw this story, (and i´ve read a lot of good ghost stories). I don´t know how to explain this movie to anyone who hasn´t seen it or doesn´t know anything about it, without spoiling the story, the drama and the horror in it. And believe me ,the horror in this movie allied with a mistery is all the fun...even if i might sound a little sadistic by putting it this way...This is a very creepy movie, altough not in the usual hollywood horror style. There´s no scares, but we get totaly unconfortable during the whole screening specialy when we meet the character of Beloved. But to give a brief idea of the plot, this is the story of a woman , who lived in a house with her daughter. And despite their house was haunted by a spirit, the woman refuse to leave the place. One day a man appears, an old friend of her and this is going to trigger some terrifying memories. Then a misterious girl with grave mental problems one day arrives alone at the house, also alone and all become a little like a family. But something was not right... And i can´t tell no more without spoiling the plot so i´ll shut up now.Just be prepared. This movie gets more into your nerves than any recent horror movie in years. And at the same time is a great drama and a brilliant exposure on slavery in rural America of the 19th century.And the actors are fantastic ! Movies like that show how injust and fake the Oscars are. Everyone here deserved to walk from this movie with a golden statuet. Ophra Winfrey, Danny Glover and Kimberly Elise who plays Ophra´s daughter, all do a superior job in every way. And Thandie Newton who plays Beloved ,will creep you to your bones sometimes more than any Poltergeist scenes in the haunted house. Everybody in this movie should be proud.The photography is beautifull, and Jonathan Demme keeps everything moving through the almost 3 hours this movie has, surprising everyone at every shot. This is his best movie. Oh, and the soundtrack couldn´t be better or more original, all based in strange chants and African drums and rithmms.How can a movie like this have failled in America ?! Is the american audiences so acostumed to movie clichés that nobody recognizes an original movie anymore ?A brilliant story, if ever there was one. A must see film.  "}]
