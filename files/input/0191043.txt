This movie is so sweet and loving, but most of all it is honest.  Unlike American films, Iranian films seem to be very open and even brutally honest about thier pain and frustration. Maybe it's because for many thier situations are so dire and we in America are so jaded by therapy and talk show catch phrases to just open op and fully express how we feel.  The pain that Muhammed and his family felt came accross as very real and genuine.  The art direction was beautiful, I had no idea that Iran was such a beautiful place.  It was so ironic that the best part of his home was the part that poor Muhammed could not see but he felt it deeply.  I would strongly suggest that you watch this movie.  Even if your not into subtitles.  My boyfriend and I came accross this movie at 2AM one night and had no intention of watching it, but after the first ten minutes we were hooked and talked about it for days.  It is magnificent.

For many years, Les Miserables (French) with Jean-Paul Belmondo was my highest recommendation. The Bridge (German) was equally haunting. But having discovered Color of Paradise (I watched it every night for five nights)I bought the DVD. I don't imagine that I will ever see a more emotionally invasive film. I've joined IMDb simply to enjoin others who loved this film. For some months, I've been trying to find the words to help organize my impressions. Where other senses may become more acute with the loss of one, perhaps the congenitally blind don't realize how emotionally transparent they are. For me, this film really struck a nerve. It is a story-journey into the world in which we live but don't often see. It left me wondering who, in this world, are actually blind? This child, his grandma and two little sisters, are consummate. I must remind myself they were only acting. I must picture set, sound, lighting, script, direction etc. to decern that this is only a movie. For everything this little boy appeared to need, he found ways to give real treasures to everything around him. The sound and cinematography were excellent. The pointed themes of this film were were heart rending. Six months later, they remain so.

I'm sure no one who has not been to Iran has any idea at all that it is this beautiful. There is plenty of symbolism for any particular point of view, which makes it fun to talk about after you see it, and although it is probably intended to be religious from the Islam point of view, you could probably find in this movie your own brand of spirituality, or lack of it, if you cared to try. I, a typically cynical and jaded New Yorker, and my completely enthusiastic and non-jaded adolescent daughter, both loved it and hope to see it again.

He shows audiences that his country is not just a place where reform movements, revolutions, and embassy seizing take place; but also where beautiful films are made.  His new motion picture; The Color of Paradise is a real treat. It is about faith and belief, unconditional love and compassion, hardship and hope; and is both powerful and effective.The lead character is a blind 8-year-old boy named Mohammad (Mohsen Ramezani).  He is filled with compassion and has unlimited abilities to reach out to the world around him.  Mohammad attends a school for the blind in Tehran.  The school is closing for the summer and students are being sent home to their parents; most of them eagerly await their kids at the front gate just outside their dormitories. Hashem (Hossein Mahjub), Mohammad's father, is not eager to see him.  In fact, he shows up so much later than everyone else that Mohammad had almost lost hope of ever seeing him again.While waiting for his dad, the 8-year-old boy, although filled with anguish, did not shut himself down from the outside world.  He successfully rescues a baby bird, climbs a tree, and returns it to its nest.  All despite his inability to see.Mohammad's dad finally shows up and requests that the school keep his son. Being told that this is not possible, he reluctantly takes the boy home.This is where writer director Majid Majidi's cinematic brilliancy comes into play.  His ability to let the audience experience both the visually impaired and visually unimpaired worlds without ever abandoning one for the other is simply remarkable.  We can see and feel both, the beauties of the boy's surroundings, and his own world where touching and hearing replace seeing.The photography is breathtaking as father and son trek home from the busy streets of Tehran into traders' and jewelry shops, then to the green mountains and fertile plains in the heights of northern Iran.  Mohammad's arrival spurs bursts of joy from his Granny (Salime Feizi), the matriarch and surrogate mother since his mom passed away; and his two sisters (Elham Sharifi and Farahnaz Safari) with genuine angelic smiles.  They are happy to see him, as they are ready to share an active farm life with him.Mohammad's admiration for nature is almost addictive; whether it's walking through fields of flowers, or running his hand over ripening grain, or having fresh water running through his fingers, or hearing birds' songs, a donkey braying or examining the sound of a gathering storm; he literally finds the patterns of Braille in everything around him.  Sounds like a loveable kid?  Not so, according to his dad's needs.  For him, the blind son is a burden, which prevents him from moving on with his life, and marrying a younger woman.  Hashem is not a malevolent man.  He is an impoverished, fast-aging, widowed, spiritually blind, hard-working charcoal maker who sees very little hope with the status quo.  So despite the staunch opposition of his mother, he is determined to send Mohammad off to a blind carpenter for woodworking apprenticeship.  But is he ready to bear the consequences of acting against Granny and the universal laws that govern the relationship between a parent and his offspring?The Color of Paradise takes viewers on an incredible journey of faith and love and creates a masterpiece of emotion that is so beautiful in its simplicity and elegance it touches one's heart.  It is done without forcing anything on the audience until the very last frame.  This film does not preach.  And it does not need to; its richness lies in its ability to portray basic elements of nature in their ordinary state.  In places where Hollywood counterparts would have inserted blasting soundtracks, this movie simply lets nature echo in the background.  Its soundtracks mostly consist of nature's own.  In times of great suspense, the sound of nature (not human-made music) helps its audience through the changing moods.Couple these facts with almost flawless acting, it's hard to compare this film with anything else in its league.  It is simply Iranian cinema at its best.  Mohsen Ramezani, who plays Mohammad, is excellent.  A scene, in which he breaks down in tears over his tribulations and questions God for making his dad not wanting him, is brutally heart wrenching.  Mohammad eventually shows us that it is possible to feel God's hand even if one can't see the color of paradise.

People were overwhelmed.It is called Color of Heaven and it focuses on a blind boy. The boy is loved by all in his family, but his father has had a tormented life filled with grief. He feels that caring for a blind boy will ruin his chances for a good second marriage, and for a family to care for him when he gets old. So, despite the attachment of others in his family to the boy, he tries to keep the boy permanently at a school of the blind, and then in a woodworking apprenticeship.The sensual vibrant color images in the film--almost surreally technicolor--illustrate the boy's sense of the world. You become fully sympathetic to the boy, cry with him, long to be loved with him. The camera is totally inside the boy's sensibility. It is a luxuriant and fully satisfying journey to an unknown place.

With only a father and a grandmother left in his family, he looks forward to summer with them once school has finished. Mohammad is full of life even though he cannot see and is constantly exploring with his hands and his grandmother loves him for this. His father is a different story and wants Mohammad out of the way so that he can remarry in an arranged ceremony with a woman who doesn't know about his son. However his plan to send Mohammad far away on an apprenticeship brings him directly into conflict with his son's grandmother.A popular choice for the Oscars in 2000, this film has developed this success and has garnered quite an audience as a result. The story is quite an emotionally involving one that is better than the basic description of the narrative suggests because this is driven by our sympathy/empathy for the characters involved. As such it works pretty well as it is easy to relate to the emotions of all of the lead three characters &#150; even the bitterness of the father was something that could be understood and felt for, at no point was he simply a bad guy for feeling what he did. At times the story gets a bit too steeped in meaningful sentiment but for the majority it is a well observed and patient story that is quite touching at points.The acting is a big factor in this working as well as it did. Ramezani is the most obvious one to praise and indeed he is praiseworthy for making his character real and convincing while never letting it become a cute kid part as so many brats can't help but do &#150; he may have been drawing on things within himself but this is still a very real performance. Mahjoub is as good for the very reason that he keeps us caring about his character even if what he is feeling is not anything we can condone. Feizi's grandmother is an unremarkable character but she delivers it well with a solid, if unimaginative, portrayal and performance. The support cast are also strong but it was the lead three that made it what it was. The direction is good, sharing an eye for detail and little daily realities with a talent for the bigger landscapes.Overall this is an impressive and enjoyable film that is beautiful to look at and has plenty to engage the heart. It may be a bit up itself at a few points but these are few and far between and the majority of the film succeeds thanks to well written characters and actors who deliver with an apparent good understanding of their characters.

I incorrectly assumed that the movie would somehow be anti-Western or full of Islamic anger. Boy, I am VERY glad I was wrong. In addition to watching this film, I watched a prior film by the same marvelous director (Children of Heaven) and found them both to be absolute joys.PART of the reason I think I enjoyed the film so much could be the subject matter since it hits so close to home. The lead is a very lovable child named Muhammad who has been dumped into a school for blind children and his very selfish father wants to leave him there--even during the summer break. I have a deaf daughter and know of MANY kids in deaf residential programs with similar families, so it REALLY hit close to home.So, about the film. What did I like? Pretty much EVERYTHING--the writing, the wonderful acting by REAL people (like the Italian Neo-Realistic films of DeSica), the exquisite cinematography and the sense of growth and change within the characters WITHOUT being unrealistic or over-the-top. This film will almost certainly make you cry as there are some incredibly sad and heart-rending moments BUT bear with it--you will be amply rewarded if you watch it to the very end.A fantastic, marvelous and wonderful film from a reviewer who is usually a bit of a cynic and RARELY rates anything this high!

But this movie is on a different level. The mystic messages are too many for so short a movie. The sound of nature is enhanced as to give the perspective of a blind child, who care too much about nature then those with sight (he didn't have sight but he had insight into the beauty of life and nature). The discerning ability of the child is portrayed as he loves nature and can tell that the hands of his granny are pure white.There are some other situations which are telling like when the granny leaves her son's home as protest, rescues a fish (metaphorically his son), puts it into a small pond (this world), but at the same time loses the gift (metaphorically loses Muhammad) which Muhammad gave her.The sounds of the beast, that the father hears, are also ominous and can be interpreted as the moan of conscience. i.e. his father is innately a good man and has a potential for seeing the world as it needs to be seen.

When world media is too preoccupied with portraying Iran as a country where revolutions, reform movements and extreme corruption takes place, his films remind the world that there's another side to the beautiful country. 'Rang-e Khoda' displays the beauty through the simplicity of everyday life in Iran.The story revolves around a blind little boy named Mohammed who's been admitted to a boarding school for the blind and now that the summer holidays are about to begin, he eagerly awaits his father to take him home for the holidays. His father reluctantly arrives later than everyone else. He sees his son as a burden, a obstacle that prevents him from moving further in life. However, his grandmother and two sisters are thrilled to see Mohammed.The characters are beautifully written. Each and every one of them are recognizable as humans we have met at some point in life. Hashem, for example isn't an evil person. After losing his wife and his faith and being affected by poverty and aging, he has his own struggles to overcome and he sees his own son's handicap as another struggle while fearing that there will be no one to take care of him at old age. But all of this prevents him from seeing what a gifted, spirited, kind and lovable child Mohammed is.The cinematography is first rate. None of the shots look staged. Every setting looks raw and authentic. The Persian landscape is breathtaking. Music is used to a minimum. Actually, it's the sounds of nature that 'function' as background score by affecting the mood. Majidi also leaves some elements open to the viewer's interpretation such as the frightening sound of the 'djin' and the very ending itself.The performances are spellbinding. I wonder how the director got child actors to deliver such sincere performances. Mohsen Ramezani, Farahnaz Safari and Elham Sharifi act so naturally. Hossein Mahjoub is excellent as the tormented Hashem and Salameh Feyzi wins the audience's heart right from her first scene.Needless to say, Majidi's films are gems. As a lover of cinema,I find the experience of a Majidi film to be quite precious as they remind me of appreciating the beauty of daily life and nature.

There are no dirty scenes which seem to pop up in so many movies nowadays, and retains a certain pure quality to it. The pace may seem a bit slow sometimes, yet director Majidi draws a plot-line so tightly focused that my attention practically never strayed. In my opinion, the pace is necessary to absorb the feeling for the characters & to allow them to grow on you. The main character truly is blind in real life. The acting comes across as more genuine. The characters surrounding him both magnify or serve as a great contrast to developing his own personality to the viewer. Therefore, some characters may appear quite simple in their presentation, and their characters left a bit undeveloped, but that draws us even closer to the emotional depth and plight of the main character (the blind boy). We are given an intimate look into his character's earnest search for love and acceptance, and how he readily gives it to those around him. Even though this boy is very young, I think that even older age groups can somehow relate to his search for pure love and acceptance, especially from the one being that everyone is blind to (at least physically) -- God.On the surface, the acting may seem somewhat simple, but that makes the underlying message even stronger. It makes the movie seem more like a surreal blur between a fantasy fable and real-life. Not knowing how to clearly draw the line adds to the beauty and magnetism of this movie. There is a strong universally spiritual yet non-denominational component to this. It is not preachy, in my opinion, because it makes mention of God without constantly waving a specific religious denomination in your face. I was deeply touched at certain scenes that I believe will stay with me for a long time. If you are looking for a movie with a solid storyline and emotionally-moving message, check out this movie.

Stuff and nonsense. Any lover of great cinema needs to see this movie.A blind boy named Mohammed awaits the arrival of his father when his school closes for a three month break. Mohammed is the last child to leave and he silently worries that his father will never arrive. When the man finally does, we learn that he feels he can no longer take care of his son due to the handicap. Feeling put-upon by his son's needs, the father tries in vain to think of ways to unload his son on someone else so he will be free to take a new bride. Father has been courting a new woman since his own wife died five years ago and he's only had the help of his own aging mother and his two young daughters to assist with Mohammed's upbringing. There are several days when Father must take Mohammed with him to work, leaving the boy to sit in the woods or by the beach while he toils at a variety of manual labor jobs. Several instances show Father hoping that his son will just wander off and disappear and he won't have to deal with him any longer. There are audible cues whenever the looming spectre of Father's selfishness rise to the surface while Mohammed hears the piping and warble of a beautiful bird, Father hears the disjointed grumblings of some unknown animal who he obviously fears. Finally, Father takes Mohammed to see a blind carpenter in hopes the man will take the boy as an apprentice, allowing Father to remarry and not have to worry about raising a handicapped son. Though Mohammed cannot see, he is very intelligent and even excels at reading at normal school, surpassing some of the students who have no disabilities. His father does not know this and forbids him to return to his sisters' school. While at the home of the carpenter, Mohammed cries and sulks, believing no one, not even his grandmother, loves him anymore since he's been abandoned. He even believes God has abandoned him.It would be criminal to give away the ending, so you'll just have to watch for yourself, and I believe you'll be glad you gave this film some of your time. It will give you a tangible respect for people living in a sightless world, not only by showing you the world through Mohammed's eyes/hands, but also by the excellent cinematography, a feast for all eyes.

However, the movie ended up becoming one of my top 20 and a movie in which I believe everyone should experience.The movie begins with the perspective of a blind perosn (which is what the entire movie is about - a blind person). You can only hear things in the beginning but once the camera is unblinded you realize that you're in a school in Iran for blind children.  THe plot follows the life of this child and his relationship to his family, particularly his father and his grandmother (granny). The film dissects the importance of love and loyalty of family ties. The only complaint about the film, which couldn't be avoided, was the subtitles, personally they give me headaches, however this was unavoidable due to the fact that it was in the Iran Language.I highly recommend viewing this movie to one and all...definately a movie that should be kept in the classroom but instead should be spread to any person whose interested in a life altering story and a movie that you'll remember forever!

The young boy who plays Mohammad, Mohsen Ramezano, was magnificent. This is the story of a father who cannot accept his blind child, and who is blind to his son's gifts and absolute adoration. And Mohammad, in his seemingly fruitless struggle to gain his father's acceptance, will break your heart. I didn't just cry, but wept during a very emotional scene where Mohammad breaks down and lets it all out about what it's like to feel so big inside, but be made to live a small, choiceless life only because his father dwells on the shortcoming of his blindness, and not the intelligence and talents he possesses.  He is loving, attentive, playful, and full of dreams.  Yet his father treats him like he's a suitcase full of anvils, dragging him around and trying to find someone else to carry the burden.  This movie is full of meaningful symbolism, and the actors do not seem to be acting.  The dialog is sparse at times, but it is then that we hear the things to which we never pay attention  The many different birdsongs, the breeze within the trees, the water running over rocks.  And for minutes at a time, we see Mohammad learning about the world through his fingertips -- the Braille letters of his lesson book, the grooves of a leaf, the fragile skin of a baby bird, the dimensions of another child's face. And during those moments, I found myself thinking, I should really open my eyes.  Precisely.

That the film takes place in Iran rather than the West doesn't detract from its powerful message.  The Color of Paradise is about two outcasts - the blind boy Mohammad who knows a great deal about suffering but is intelligent enough to compensate for his physical infirmity, and his widowed father who is only beginning to deal with his social infirmity.  Perhaps the opening sequence best epitomizes this tension, as Mohammed is left at blind school waiting for his father and manages to carry a stray bird back to the tree nest while the father arrives, stunned and befuddled at the prospect of having to take his son home.  Mohammad is clearly wanted by his 'granny' and by his two sisters who delight in playing games and even taking him to their regular school.  But society is not kind to a man with damaged goods nor to a man who grows old without a strong normal son to support him.  In his quest to start up a new family, the father wants to jettison Mohammad, not knowing that the boy is uniquely gifted or that his love will only come out when Mohammad's life is in danger.  Symbols abound in this film, from the frequent use of hands communicating touch, friendship, and longing to the ominous call that the father hears to Granny's dropped pin after she has brought a squirming fish back to water.  There is an especially thought provoking scene involving Mohammad and the blind carpenter in which the tearful boy questions why God would allow him to be blind while others are not.  His teachers have told him that God is invisible and he should seek to touch him in everything he does, to which the carpenter can only turn and walk away.  The Color of Paradise conveys a powerful message about those who we discard as insignificant and the last scene is both a wonderment and a source of consolation.

There are plenty of human situations and characters that will appeal to everyone while the true meaning penetrates into the subconscious -- at least of those open and aware enough.Others have written a brief synopsis, so I will skip that. Read them. But this movie is not really about the blind boy. It's about his father. I'm not going to write a long essay, but I will point out what I think are the keys. Watch the movie (again if necessary) and note these parts, and ponder the significance. The disillusioned, disappointed, frustrated father, angry at God. He doesn't deserve his life. His only son, representing his inner child, is blind. The son is not disillusioned. The son hears things better and feels things better than just about anyone else. There is a young male carpenter (carpenter? just a coincidence? Nothing in a great movie is a coincidence) who is a teacher. There is a strange eerie sound that the father hears on three occasions.

I consider myself to be pretty hardened, having been a street cop for over 22 years and a firefighter for 10 years before that. I have seen a lot of human suffering and I have become very hardened to it but this movie had me in tears more than once. It's about a innocent little boy who lives in the mountains of Iran and has been blind since birth. His mother has recently died and his father considers him a burden not only on his life in general but also toward his attempt to find another bride. The boy has been sent to live and study at a school for the blind and here you will see blindness from a myriad causes we are lucky to no longer have in the USA. The boy has an innate intelligence and a strong curiosity about the world around him, which he experiences as a world of sound and tactile senses. His father wants him to stay in the school but he is forced to take him home and now he is concerned that his brides family will find out he has bad genes or something. Once home the boy reconnects with a loving grandmother and 2 loving sisters and even the people of his village are tolerant of him and show him affection. Yet his father schemes to be rid of him and at times you can see in his eyes he couldn't be blamed if the boy wandered off or befell some other natural death. However the father finds a blind carpenter a long way away who takes the boy as an apprentice. But from the start guilt seems to be chasing the father and we see him reacting to a raucous type of bird call from the deep forest that appears at these moment as if it is a demon calling him out in accusation. Several aspects begin to drag at the father, weighing him down with guilt until the end when he must decide to let the boy die in a natural accident or will his love for the boy finally over come his past transgressions, guilt and self pity. Will the father step back and let nature take its course or will his love for the boy finally wake him up to the fact that his son has always been a blessing on him, not a weight around his neck. And will his decision come in time to save his soul and the boy's life? The makers of this movie prove that excellence knows no border and cannot be stifled.

The movie is deliberately simplistic in nature, but quite charming and delightful at the same time.The sequence in the beginning where the blind boy rescues a baby bird, climbs the tree and puts it back in the nest is an amazing scene, and says so much about the character in such a short instant. All the characters in the movie are interesting; there are mainly three - the blind boy (Mohammad), his father, and his grandma.What might be a burden for someone may be a blessing for someone else. Life is what we make of it. Who is the one actually blind, the boy or the people around him? What do we actually see around us? The absence of one sense makes the other senses so acute. The boy was much more attuned to his surrounding environment than anyone else.There's no actual background music used in the movie, but it utilizes the sounds of nature to tell about the environment, which is even more effective.The ending feels a little contrived, but it's upto satisfaction.

To try and turn a theme which is in itself heartbreaking into a strong and worthy piece of art is of course a risky business. Although I find other Iranian directors (let's say Mehrjui, Kiarostami, Panahi, Ghobadi) more interesting, I believe that Majidi is a gifted artist who perfectly knows how to make the most out of balancing on the brink of mawkish sentiment/pathos. His movies - i.e. the four I have seen - evidently look up to Italian neo-realism (there are even concrete points of contact between Rang-e khoda and Ladri di biciclette, among others), oscillating between a sociological/ethnographic study, sociocritical statement, tearjerking melodrama, religious/spiritual fable and pure fairy-tale. For some (re)viewers, such an amalgam may be too much to bear (not only the otherwise outstanding sequence when Mohammad rescues a baby bird raises doubts about its credibility), but thanks to the director's cinematic treatment it offers moments where it reaches almost Chaplinesque quality.I don't feel an urge to comment on Rang-e khoda's beautiful cinematography, flawless acting, rich soundscape, or sometimes spoonfeeding symbolism - others have done it before, and better. My last small remark concerns the annoying sound that structures the second half of the movie like an ominous refrain. One reviewer suggests it's wolves ; to me, it seems rather like a cry of some bird (a wild turkey, perhaps ??) regarded by the locals as a sign of ill luck.As to the quality of the Sony's disc, it's way better than the British and German ones (both with AR cut to 43 !).

Ramezani (blind in real life) plays a blind boy returning home for the summer from his school for the blind. He is considered a burden by his father, whom pities himself more than his son. The message of the film is one against self-pity. Mohammad finds beauty everywhere he goes, and it is captured in every frame. Seeing him find a bird fallen from its nest and returning it is a lengthy, simple, but captivating scene. Once he returns home, Mohammad reunites with his sisters and Grandmother. They all treat Mohammad as an equal, and use his disability to experience the world in new ways. It's difficult to capture the struggles of the blind in a visual medium, so looking at the unique feelings is a much more appropriate way of handling the subject. He amazes a teacher by reading with braille, he focuses on the sounds of birds, and he holds his breath as he hears the waves about to crash over his feet. Mahjoob plays the father well, but his self-pity becomes a chore for the viewer. He isn't cruel in an evil sense, just too whiny to really connect with.

This is another great film from Majid Majidi, who first touched my heart with The Children of Heaven (Bacheha-Ye aseman (1997)) and has succeeded in opening still another door into the universal soul of man with this film.  Who in the United States would dare make a film about a blind boy, his hopes, dreams, sorrows, and family, and about his father, so caught up in himself that his schemes to alleviate the miseries of his life only serve to compound them?Here we see natural life and death, not contrived murder and mayhem, and we are left to think about both the wonders and beauties of life and the great mystery of death.

Although that is certainly the case with The White Balloon and Is this My Friend's House? (the latter I admire very much), I feel almost bound to eat my words when confronted by a film as luminously beautiful as The Colour Of Paradise; after all Bicycle Thieves covered a small canvas as did Pather Panchali and yet can one think of two more perfectly conceived films. That I mention The Colour of Paradise in the same breath is an indication of its stature. Like Angelopoulos's The Beekeeper it ends with a shot of a hand, but whereas the twitching hand of the beekeeper subsides as death takes over, that of the blind boy in the Iranian film is a resurrection from stillness into life. Whereas the Greek masterpiece is a cry of despair from a world where God has never entered, what starts as a scream of rage in The Colour of Paradise at God's injustice - that of the father afflicted with the curse of having to look after his blind son and the boy because he cannot see the world around him let alone God - finds resolution in the father's realisation that God has given him something precious in the form of his son. Poignant as the boy's performance is, it is the character of the father and its development that is the core of the film. At first we hate him for his selfishness. When he first rails against the misfortune that has robbed him of his wife leaving him with a blind charge and even later when his misfortunes are compounded by his failure to enter into a second marriage and the death of his mother, we still accuse him of ingratitude as he has the compensation of sight and is not, like his small son, stumbling about is a dark world totally dependant on others. It is only when we realise that his sighted world is twisted by an inner darkness that we are able to see him in a different light, that of a man who needs help just as much as his son. The solace that we experience at the film's final moment derives from the certain knowledge that the way is now open for father and son to find comfort in each other, a simplistic but deeply satisfying conclusion.

And also a dark drama about a father who is sorry for himself that he is a widower left with the burden of a blind child, who tries to get rid of the burden by apprenticing the boy to a blind carpenter, so that he can take a new wife.   To us in the west it is very odd that the father never speaks to his intended wife, but only visits with her family.   He lives in a small village.   Surely they know that he has a blind son.  Why does he not discuss the boy - we see him discussing his daughters on one of the visits.   Also his intention to apprentice his son to the carpenter would surely have gone better if he had prepared the boy for it by talking to him.   However this is part of the portrait of the father's character.A good editing decision is that all through the film, sounds of nature, animals, plants, water etc, are louder than usual, as is appropriate in a film about a blind person.The climax in the storm, develops this further, and I was thinking that the boy on the horse led by his father must be quite frightened by the noises that he cannot see.  As they started over the footbridge, I knew from the sound edit that the bridge was going to collapse.  The edit of the next few minutes, the frightened horse, the boy in the water, the horse in the water, and the slow motion sequence as the trauma hits the father, before the father starts to run down the river bank.  The slow motion captures the trauma, but it also dramatizes the father's ambivalence about his burden-son.  Of course he does the proper thing and runs, then swims after his son.  But the moment of hesitancy intensifies the emotion of the ending.   This is an excellent edit suitable for analysis in a film-techniques course.

The movie's focus was on the struggles of this family, but with the exception of some religious comments, it ignored analyzing larger political or cultural issues.  In a way this probably reflects the country and culture that the movie came out of, but it was unexpected and interesting to see a movie that was powerful and touching in the simplicity of its plot and themes.

At first it seems like a simple tale of a selfish father who wants to be rid of his young blind son who is perceived to be a barrier to the father's future happiness.  However, after one scene where the father explains his feelings of anguish at the hand that life has dealt him, it's easier to see his point of view, and his side of the story.  He loves his children, we see that when he returns home one night and checks on his two sleeping daughters, lovingly adjusting the blankets around them.  Western viewers have to keep in mind that social safety nets for the poor and elderly do not exist in all countries.  In the Iranian culture, an elderly parent will eventually become dependent on the sons of the families - and clearly the father here knows that there is little hope of his blind son ever being independent and self-supporting, let alone able to support the father when the time comes.  He tells himself he is doing the best thing for his son by apprenticing him to a blind carpenter far from home, but even the grandmother says this is a self-serving gesture.  It's probably a little of both.  The little boy's own grief at being abandoned and unloved by all, even his granny (so it seemed to him), is heartbreaking.  All in all, although beautifully filmed in the surprisingly (to me) lovely countryside of Iran, this is something of a downer movie, maybe even a tearjerker.  The finale is somewhat ambiguous and the viewer can imagine whatever longterm ending s/he prefers.

This time, the storyline may seem straightforward but it's layered with emotions enduringly strong, fulfilled by fantastic actors. So much is told simply on their faces be it joy, sadness, gut wrenching dilemma or misery, wistful bewilderment, and all the nuances of a blind boy's facial expressions (from Mohsen Ramezani as Mohammad.) The cinematography also captured the beauty of the Iranian countryside landscape - its hills, forests, fields, greens and colorful flowers.As the film opens, we are given a sense of being in the dark - black blank screens with only subtitles to the voices we hear&#133;eventually we see some cassettes and a crowd of youngsters around a man (their teacher)&#133;we are at a school for the blind children in Tehran.Besides the various Iranian traditions and livelihood in the villages beyond the city of Tehran, we get to appreciate the language of nature as Mohammad hears it through the rippling sound of river rapids, constant repeats of birds chirping a-calling in the forest, leaves rustling in the wind. Truly, the color of paradise eludes not to an innocent blind boy. But Mohammad's father (played by Hossein Mahjoub), who wanted to shed this burden of a blind son so he can be married again, is in such a rut - feeling so miserable, he's blind and numb to it all.Mohammad's grandmother (wonderfully portrayed by Salime Feizi) is the soul and bond that ties the family together. She loves her grandson dearly and maintains a kindred connection with Mohammad. Through her we felt the glimmer of hope that her son could eventually come to his senses and face life/reality head on to appreciate the existence of his (blind) son. I can appreciate the magically indescribable bond between the grandmother and the grandchild as I recall my dearly departed grandmother.In 90 minutes, the film is gem-packed with many levels of poignant sensitivity. Director and cinematographer collaborated in presenting poetic moments enhanced by the lyrical film score. The simple act of feeding the chickens the happiness of being together glows on the faces of Granny, Mohammad and his two sisters, with feathers flying, petals gliding. The three children running in the vast fields with the colorful flowers all around (just like the film's poster), such joy is echoed in their laughter.What a gripping, emotional ending sequence - awe is the word, literally speechless. (I did wish the camera held one second longer before the credits roll.) Majid Majidi is a rare gemstone of a filmmaker from Iranian cinema - a man of substance and role model. Again he shows us somehow there is always a glimmer of light, that there are gods out there who will bestow hope.Experience this Color of Paradise journey.

Children of Heaven was my second Iranian film, having seen White Balloon (Dir. by Jafar Panahi, 1995) before. And I couldn't eradicate the notion which lingered on me that night when seeing Children of Heaven, that it was a rip off of WB-I couldn't eradicate it, couldn't-until the very scene in CH where the little girl drops her brother's shoes, and is trying to chase after it. I sigh with glee and marvel watching the poor dainty Iranian girl, in the city streets, chasing thitherward a singular shoe.  Even though the shoe was impeded by a couple of trash in the canal, the girl still cried because it's so near, yet far. Until the man seeing this girl took consideration and applied a lending hand, eventually the little one walked back home with one shoe wet. Little scenes like that, really stabbed within the unfathomable void in my heart, and I couldn't help it but fall in love at that film.  So when I found out that the writer and director of that film has a new one movie out, ferocious jubilation surging against my vein was an understatement.So now, after seeing the film-Color of Paradise, the question lies amongst the atmosphere like a thick fog Did I like it?The answer, no.I loved it.  The rife symbolism, profound poetic language translated into scenes of majestic splendor in the film abounds-rife with pure joy.  After seeing this film, my headache-well it still lingered, but it somewhat subsided. And after seeing this film, I really want to go to Iran now.  I can't help but think about little magical village of the character Ashitaka in PRINCESS MONONOKE(dir. Hayao Miyazaki, 1997) before he was forcefully set off to his quest, the serene village of Kurosawa's RHAPSODY IN AUGUST(1992), Kurosawa's last story in his DREAMS(1994), and in Miyazaki's MY NEIGHBOR TOTORO(1988).  The scene in COLOR OF PARADISE, after leaving Muhammid's school-are like a Renoir painting, its glamorous vibrancy was unexpected before the Expressionist, so was the beauty, it was unexpected from Iran. Now I am one of the many ignoramus Westerners whose completely oblivious to the fact that Iran procured a paradise, so in a way, I was like Muhammid, with all respects.  And I completely felt the father's pauses when he's in the state of deciding if he should consider helping the child, this comes to play dramatically in the climax.  Which brings me to mind-maybe I can be poetic about this and say that the reason why they have that horse, the real thing, fall off the bridge, and be trampled with all those jagged, piercing like thousand knives, rocks-was because throughout the film, the animals were always rescued , except the upturned turtle-which might be an ominous harbinger of things to come.  At any rate, I would like to take liberties of regarding some of the hidden messages and poignant yet elegant way of weaving poetic pictures-to compare Majidi's work to Kurosawa's, and Tarkovsky's.  I love how Majidi's endearment for whispered voices.  It's like his film, soft, and subtle, serene to the eyes, or ears when whispering.  It is so demulcent it can be considered narcotics.  I have so much to tell about this film, but I'm afraid my indolence is catching up like a turtle, for I am the once boastful prestigious rabbit.  Hmm, anyway, I would like to mention the scene in CHILDREN OF HEAVEN, where the dad take's his son, Ali, in the city-now for those of you fortunate enough to have seen the film in the first place (and those of you who haven't, try anyway) do take the liberty of keeping in mind of what had happened in the last part of that scene The father and the son couldn't stop the bike and was forced to partake in an accident, and have to go home in a bitter sweet glory, yet when there is suffering-goodness comes out of it, it is very much like the climax of COLOR OF PARADISE.And oh, it just occurred to me, Majidi seems to adore gilded objects in the end of his films.

It's really the story of Job told in an Islamic setting. The commandment that comes from on high is to acknowledge and submit to your lot in life--in the case of the father to devote himself to his son and his well-being, despite the heavy burden that that imposes on him. There's also the message that, along life's way, we must always be attentive to the needs of others (as exemplified, in a positive way, by the blind boy's rescue of animalitos in distress; and, in a negative way, by the father's lack of attention to the turtle on its back and in distress). And the failure of the father to submit to the lot of Job means that he must suffer God's wrath and further punishment. God's will be done, as they say. Not a bad message coming from Islam in one sense One should shoulder one's responsibilities towards others who are needy; but, do we need the threat of divine punishment to recognize this duty we all have to do the right thing? After all, a humanist doesn't need to read the Koran to know that we should do unto others as we would have them do unto us.

The acting from the young blind boy is fantastic, and the film has plenty of sad, emotional scenes which will have your eyes tearing up.On the down side, there is not really much of a story, this doesn't harm the film but equally does not do it any favours either. I also found that there is a bit too much tragedy and sadness in the film, and it cast a bit too much of a shadow over the beautiful scenery and nature shots.I've seen that a lot of people have claimed this film is a masterpiece and I can't help wondering if they have little or no experience of Iranian cinema, and so watched this film not knowing what to expect and found a beautiful film, then overreacted slightly with their reviews. It is well worth watching in my opinion, but it is not Majidi's finest work (that honour goes to The Willow Tree)and is not really any better than his other films.

The children are so innocent and real that I think they are not acting, but they are being themselves. This film is warm! Also it gives me a new perspective to blind children.

This movie's cinematography is its best attribute. Gorgeous scenery is an incessant reminder of how wonderful it is to be able to see. Of course, the blind boy sees what his sighted, craven father chooses to ignore. The end was a bit preachy and pat, a Muslim version of deus ex machina.

A lovely, simple, and heartfelt tale, The Color of Paradise is typically Iranian in its telling of a father who wrestles with his conscience as he begins to see his son as a burden interfering with his happiness and success. Hollywood blockbuster audiences will likely find this simple film just so much underdone sentimentalism. Film purists and those undaunted by cultural differences will appreciate the pastoral and lyrical beauty of this film most.

The color of Paradise is a masterpiece. the script is beautiful, the cinematography is OK and the acting is just sheer brilliance! The boy Mohsen Ramezani who played the role of Mohammed has put quite an amazing performance, I believe most of the audience have noticed that. finding these actors was quite difficult for the makers of the film and it is wonderful how they were able to find a boy so good at acting, yet resembling the character in the film that much. however, I dread the fact that the movie had no soundtracks whatsoever! many scenes could have been way better if they contained background music. maybe there was a certain philosophy to it, but if there was it surely didn't get to me.

It was very moving to see an Arabian family struggling with many of the same challenges that face us, especially today.  There was a son who was trying to cope with his disability, a father who is ashamed of him, and a grandmother who just wanted her family to be together.  Made in Iran, the film is full of Islamic undertones; but many of them affirm the belief that we are all one poeple, not thousands of different sects.

It had a touching story too but screened in a rather natural manner.This movie, on the contrary, has a direct symbolic manner which I don't feel comfortable to get its message clearly. Too much symbolism kills the naturalness which eventually lead the movie to a dead end; indeed its final scenes are almost nonsense making me say so what.I love Iranian movies very much, Iranian cinema has a deserved reputation all over the world, Majidi has a notable part of it. Regardless of the movie itself, I admired the country side where the movie filmed. I would like to have a chance to see those places in a same season of year. For me who is an obsessed admirer of nature, it would be relieving for my should struggling with city life.

This isn't quite as calculated a crowd-pleaser as Majidi's earlier Children Of Heaven, although just about undoes the whole of that relative restraint in a  fairly shameless, laughably sentimental (and ponderously foreshadowed) final image. The film has a certain pictorial finesse, and is never more engrossing than when aligned most closely with the child's point of view - evoking the vivid aural and tactile contours of his world. But when the film moves beyond that almost documentary-like core, it tends to find too-easy visual formulae and emotional evocations. "},{"Title":"Catering to the tastes of childish minds","Date":"1 August 2000","Score":"1 out of 15 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Adventure, Drama, Family","Review":"  This a primitive fairy tale catering to the tastes of sentimental Western audience. The visual language is suitable for a 10 year old and completely unreal it shows a blind boy climbing a tall tree in search of a nest (successful) and running at full speed in the fields. The least plausible and most corny frame is the last one, when the boy shows signs of life after pretty rough swim in mountain rapids. What is even worse, the movie carries a strong ideological message that extremely successfully brainwashes American public Iran is a happy society living with modest means but strong faith; women of all ages are happy and free; Islam is free and natural choice of all human beings that help them in all walks of life. Show this movie to your kids to clear their lacrimal glands. Otherwise, it's waste of time.

It was quite boring through much of the film.  It combined sadness and sympathy with anger and a feeling of what was that all about?.I thought this film had a good beginning and made me quite interested with the future of this lovable blind boy, but his father killed the film with his unsympathetic, selfish behavior.  The film was inspiring and informative with Afghanistani behaviors and culture, but the ending could have done a little better.  The movie suddenly ends leaving the viewer wondering what in the world just happened and I thought could have been approached differently.If you are in to films about different cultures, and you like to be disappointed with character flaws, this is your movie.  While the movie was very well done of showing the surroundings through the eyes of the blind boy, it disappointed me with its ending. "}]
