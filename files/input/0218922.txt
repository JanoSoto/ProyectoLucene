[{"Title":"If truly watched, you cannot walk away from loving this gem!","Date":"5 December 2002","Score":"102 out of 139 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama, Mystery, Romance","Review":" Usually I rely on the voting averages to give me an idea of how good a movie is. I have to admit that a 5.6 rating is much different from what I would give this film.Original Sin seemed to be the movie that everyone walked away from. The only thing I remember about its opening was all the chatter about the nude scenes. I guess it reminded a lot of viewers about the whole Wild Orchid/Showgirls fiasco which is still etched in the mind's-eye of every self-conscious moviegoer. Perhaps this apparent smoke screen of an issue caused Angelina Jolie's (often chapped and super-pouty) lips to be sealed regarding her role in the movie. Likewise, the dependably silent/aloof Antonio Banderas was even harder to locate when it came to any promotion of the film. And after making sure every radio listener heard, The Music of My Heart, even the inconspicuously conspicuous Estefans forgot to drop the hint that they contributed to the film's lushly romantic score.The fact that this was not a perfect movie didn't prevent it from being an excellent one. I think the film's real problem was that it couldn't quite fit into the typical Hollywood hype machine that has crowned more inferior material with non-stop publicity and gratuitously glowing reviews. It could also be due to the fact that the plot, not a love-story, but a story about love, didn't match the small space many viewers have reserved in their hearts for Romance and Drama - just not both!Anyone who takes the time to TRULY WATCH THIS MOVIE will find that they cannot walk away from loving it. Banderas and Jolie succeed in being both glamorous and gritty. Antonio Banderas is one of the most beguiling actors in contemporary cinema (believe it or not). I am always amazed by the vast artistic depth that lays beneath the stereotypical Latin-lover super-bronzed matin√©e-idol exterior that he has been assigned to. Banderas' talents, like this movie, are grossly underrated and marginally explored. His every motion gives Vargas the pitch-perfect blend of simplicity and passion. Banderas' portrayal makes it hard not to hurt when Vargas hurts or trust when he trusts. This makes it easy to see why the naive Vargas and the lethal Julia/Bonnie are integrally compatible.Wacko Jacko antics aside, Jolie, in all her un-Gwynnethness, is a site to have and behold. As the mysterious Julia, she is one mail-order bride who can both sell her body and steal a man's soul. Jolie succeeds in revealing every aspect of Bonnie's internal struggle to achieve personal authenticity while accepting a once-in-a-lifetime chance at true intimacy.In many ways, the film is about humankind's universal need to be, who we truly are as well as the long, winding and often treacherous road toward love's salvation (closely examine the play Julia & Vargas went to see). The movie's many twists and turns represent the bloody sacrifices/transgressions that often mark the way. This was constantly echoed through a script which foreshadowed the story's theme (in a manner both poetic and hypnotic). Equally intoxicating were the use of nontraditional cinematography and sound techniques. They perfectly complemented the period-heavy scenery and costume. All these elements melded to create a picture that was at once abundantly sensual, visually stunning and emotionally sensitive - with an excellent ending!Oh, and as for the much talked about skin scenes. I thought they were well done. Gratuitous, yes. Gratifying - definitely! If you've got it, flaunt it. Banderas and Jolie absolutely have it, and then-some!

Original Sin is a tale of emotion.  With beautiful cinematography, wonderful costumery, the plot is rivalled only by Hitchock's Vertigo.Set in Cuba in the late 19th Century, the story revolves around a man, named Luis Vargas, played by Antonio Bandaras, and the mail-order bride, with whom he falls in love.  Vargas, who at the start of the film is marrying for convenience alone, because of his business, finds himself emotionally capsized by the sumptuous Julia Russell, played to the hilt by the fulsome-lipped Angelina Jolie.  But when Vargas's new bride suddenly disappears, the businessman discovers that his life is now totally based in her.Let us go back to Vertigo, the obvious source of this film.  In it, Scotty Ferguson, played by James Stewart, is obsessed with Madeleine Elster, played by Kim Novak.  When Scotty witnesses Madeleine plummet to her death, his world takes a dismal tern, until he meets Judy Barton, her physical twin.  The thing is that Madeleine and Judy are one and the same.  Here was Hitchcock's irony of the illusion of Madeleine falling to her death actually gives rise to the demise of Scotty's soul.In Original Sin, Angelina Jolie plays Eve to Thomas Jane's serpent.    Antonio Bandaras is poor Adam, with only one woman in all of the world for him.  There is even Lillith, all too quickly dispatched.  But forbidden fruit, once swallowed, the loss of Paradise is soon to appear.  From my point of view, this is a must see film with intelligence, symbolism and beauty.

The movie itself is not bad at all. There are surprises a plenty which of course I won't reveal. Since the expected doesn't occur that provides plenty of incentive to follow the story through to the end. Since the movie is an erotic thriller there are of course... erotic scenes! Ms. Jolie is definitely an attractive woman by conventional standards! It goes without saying that her smoldering looks keep the viewer fixated on her character, Julia. Banderas fans should note that his chemistry with a female costar hasn't been this good since his hookup with Catherine Zeta-Jones in Zorro.  Thomas Jane, whose other work I am not familiar with, is also excellent in his role. Very good entertainment, 7/10.

When I saw the cover, I figured it was going to be just your typical dark love story...ha ha, guess again. This movie was awesome!  Not only does it keep you guessing throughout the entire story, you can't help but notice all of the eye stoppers.  The cinematography was absolutely stunning, the filming locations were impeccable for beautiful scenery and spots, and the graphic love scenes...well, as much as I could have done without them, they certainly did add a lot to the film.  Every part of the movie was exceptionally well done, and I fell in love with this piece.If you're a movie buff like me, you might remember a little film that came out in 1994 with James Spader entitled 'DreamLover'.  Now, although that movie is surpassed by Banderas and Jolie's hit, they do share a bit of the same flavor as one another.  I remember seeing the Spader flick on t.v. one night and thought it was really great, however after seeing this I was reminded of the film, and thought that they shared similar traits.  Though, as I said before, this movie was a lot better. Much more A quality, bigger names, bigger production, and basically more money was spent making it, which more often than not, is a good thing, and helps the film rather than hurting it.Jolie and Banderas have never been favorites of mine, and in fact the only movie I ever liked Angelina in before this was 'Girl Interrupted', and Banderas in 'Two Much'.  This one, though, made me think twice about both the actors abilities on screen.  They executed such a great chemistry between one another.  I found myself even crying by the end of the movie.  It is truly unlike any other movie I've ever seen.  Sure, the premise was similar to others that I have seen in the past, but the directing, acting and just whole feel of the film was so unique and so on its own.  I loved it!  I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys a great intense romance.I would advice, however, that some of the scenes especially at the beginning are a bit crazy (sexually that is).  Bare breasts, and well, just a whole lot of nakedness kind of take over the movie from time to time, so parents caution.But, otherwise I give the movie two thumbs up, it rocked! I give it a 10/10!  Great story about love!

Their sex scenes are extremely memorable, so make sure you get an un-edited version (unrated).Banderas plays a wealthy Cuban coffee farmer whose dedication to his trade has thus-far distracted him from the important business of finding a good wife. Using a matchmaker, he agrees to marry a woman from Connecticuit. He has been dishonest, however, in describing himself as a man of only average means. Banderas admits his dishonesty to his new wife (Jolie). However, it soon becomes clear that there is more to her than meets the eye, as well. Soon Banderas becomes so obsessed with Jolie that her lies destroy his entire life. He is well aware of what is happening every step of the way, but he doesn't care.So, this is an interesting movie for a few reasons. As stated above, the sex scenes are among the best ever filmed. It is also novel to see a film about a man who is actually obsessed about his own wife. I personally could identify with Banderas in his willingness to give up everything for woman he knows he cannot trust. Heck, it happens to the best of us.

I admit it-I am totally taken by period pieces whose setting is somewhere in Latin America and if those movies have good sets and/or locations then I am smitten. Original Sin, set in Cuba and filmed in Mexico had the visuals down perfect-throw in the acting of Jolie and Banderas and you have a visual feast.The book/script were fabulous vehicles for the acting of the majors as well as a framework that works beautifully for the intrigues that pepper this film. This script should keep viewers interested throughout and I will definitely be renting this film so that I can savour it without interminable commercials. I want to wallow in the beauty of the images and settings at least one more time.Any viewer who likes settings and images from slightly earlier times owes it to themselves to look for Original Sin in their local rental shop because it is a wonderful film that seemed to slip by the reviewers when it was released.

He tells his close friend, She is not meant to be beautiful, she's meant to be kind, and true, and young enough to bear children. You see, Luis also thinks, Love is not for me. Love is for those people who believe in it.  He just needed heirs. The boat is due in at 6AM, they can be married at 9AM, and I can be back to work by 10AM.The boat comes in, he finds Julia (Jolie), who isn't homely at all, but beautiful. She tells him she sent him a photo of someone else, because she didn't want him to want her just because she was beautiful. To which he replies, I'm not really a clerk with a coffee company, I own the company. I didn't want you to marry me because I am rich. The we both cannot be trusted, she says. some SPOILERS - The movie's title is aptly chosen. Julia is really Bonnie, who along with Billy ran away from the orphanage at age 14 and the two of them have lived a life of deceptions ever since. In another version this film could have been called Billy the pimp and Bonnie the whore. Everything during the first half of this story was their murdering the real Julia on the boat, then assuming her identity so that Bonnie and Billy could steal all Luis' money, which they do after Luis foolishly converts all his accounts to joint accounts.I found the first half of the movie more interesting. Bonnie is narrating from a jail cell, we know she was caught at something, not sure what, and they are preparing to execute her. The second half gets complicated as Billy, posing as a P.I., gets into the mix. The problem Luis has is this, even though he despises what Bonnie has done, he falls inexplicably in love with her, the person he finds in reality, with all her good and bad.  She eventually reciprocates, they both end up wanting to get rid of Billy. They do, in an altercation when she shoots him.Bonnie at the last hour works one more deception, convinces the priest in her cell that she is sorry and seeks forgiveness, and he swaps clothes with her so she escapes right before her execution. In the end we see Bonnie and Luis in Morocco, he is gambling, she is serving, and flashing secret signs for him to win by cheating. He started out as an honest man, she was his Eve, this has become his original sin.  I can recommend this film, if for no reason than the remarkable job Angelina Jolie does with a script that doesn't deserve it. However, it also tells a good story of how love, in this case Luis', has power over life.  Most of us have done something out of character in the guise of love.  The cinematography is lush, and surround sound is used for good effect. Terrence Blanchard (New Orleans trumpeter) adds a very good mood-setting soundtrack, like the wailing and sensuous trumpet tune, accompanied by percussion, during the first love scene.

Thinking it was more or less about Jolie's T&A, it actually had a decent plot with some twists and turns running throughout. I liked this film a lot. Her character had many levels that you didn't see coming. It seemed like a one dimensional character as most temptresses are, but Jolie was nothing of the sort. She attacked the role with her usual vigor and gave life to what could have been a meaningless character. Banderas was a little overdone I think, but it kinda makes sense with the lines he was given. Being all obsessed with his wife like that can make you seem overly dramatic. I'd recommend it.

It left me cold.The costumes were as yummy as the sets were fake. The leads were badly underwritten. Banderas nails Luis's little-boy innocence, Jolie nails Bonnie's ice-cold cunning, but I didn't care about either of them, nor did I believe that he would willingly ruin himself for her. That he winds up taking Billy's place was beyond belief!And I have a silly question how did Billy find out Luis was actually loaded if poor Ms. Russell thought he was just a humble clerk at a coffee company?

But there are always the occasional theatrical releases, such as Basic Instinct (great sex scenes, sporadically interesting story), Bound (steamy sex scenes, good plot, Jennifer Tilly is annoying as hell), Wild Things (dull sex scenes, fun plot twists), and Color of Night (ludicrous story, but features one of the best sex scenes in mainstream cinema!).  Original Sin can be added to the list, but it's easily the worst of the lot, giving us two stars who generate no heat, and a story that isn't ridiculously convoluted enough to be trashy fun.  Really, this movie's all talk, without enough genuine passion, suspense, and not enough bare skin (and I saw the unrated version).Antonio Banderas stars as an incredibly dumb coffee mill owner who's just been arranged to meet his mail-order bride.  He's written letters to her and has seen some pictures of her, but when he meets her face-to-face, she's nothing like he expects.  The bride turns out to be Angelina Jolie, whose sensuous looks and curves captivates our protagonist.  It seems she sent a different picture of herself so that a man won't be looking to marry her for her looks.  What a great, deceptive star to their marriage.  Oh, yes, their marriage is bliss, as they continuously make love and declare their love for one another.  But then it turns out she actually isn't his mail-order bride; she's taken all his money, leaving poor Banderas heart-broken and dead-set to find her.  Enter Thomas Jane, whose role is obvious from the start to any semi-keen viewer.Original Sin is the kind of film that will probably have your eyes rolling from all the overdone dialogue (Can't you see I cannot...LIVE without you?!) and squirming in your seat as you wait for something important to happen.  Story-wise, well, you'd be surprised how little plot there is.  Aside from what I've described, there's hardly anything else to be mentioned.  None of the plot twists are surprising or even amusingly over-the-top, so you'll probably find yourself tapping your feet out of boredom.This might have still been a somewhat engaging venture if I cared about the situation and the characters, but no, Banderas' is too gullible to root for and Jolie is...well...I've honestly never much liked Jolie; she's always one-note with her performances and her huge lips and really creepy resemblance to Jon Voight (her dad) is a distraction that not even decent acting (which she doesn't qualify for) can account for.  The fact that both actors (as well as Thomas Jane) don't even seem to realize they're starring in such a trashy film only damages the film further.  They take this material far too seriously.The only thing worthy of note in this entire film is a somewhat graphic sex scene between Banderas and Jolie.  Cinema these days has grown rather tame with on-screen sex, so I guess it's nice to see nudity on display in a big-studio release (though, make no mistake, even unrated, this scene is not as graphic or even as well-directed as the sex scenes in Color of Night or Basic Instinct).  Unfortunately, director Michael Cristofer manages to even screw up this scene, giving us way too many dissolves, fade-ins, and odd camera angles as if though he thought he was spicing things up.  No, it just adds a yawn.  Hard to believe, but Jolie managed to star in the two worst films of 2001, an accomplishment I don't think any other actor can boast.  As far as erotic thrillers go, you'd be better off renting any of the films I mentioned above or better yet, Brian De Palma's edge-of-the-seat 1984 voyeuristic thriller Body Double.

Cornell Woolrich's novel Waltz Into Darkness would seem an ideal murder-mystery/sexual thriller to absorb a modern-day audience (as a storyteller, Woolrich was far ahead of his time), but writer-director Michael Cristofer doesn't have the teasing personality, nor the sure-handed style, to bring out the juicy twists of this tale. Leads Antonio Banderas and Angelina Jolie look good together in and out of their clothes, but his forceful, full-blooded acting eclipses hers by a mile. Jolie is not convincing in this period setting; she has little range and, once the camera begins feasting upon her features in Mount Rushmore-like close-ups, her focus visibly wavers (it's a dreadful performance). Told in flashback, we are immediately privy to Jolie's mysteries, with an outcome that defies explanation. Cristofer intermittently tries out different photographic tricks and editing techniques, presumably to pad the running time but in effect showing off his uncertainty as a filmmaker. The dialogue (and Jolie's indifferent delivery of it) is often ludicrously funny, though Banderas deserves credit for at least attempting to take his part of the project seriously. *1/2 from **** "},{"Title":"A grand and shiny monument to implausibility.","Date":"1 July 2002","Score":"7 out of 10 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama, Mystery, Romance","Review":"    ***SPOILERS***   ***SPOILERS*** I'm trying to remember a worse movie that I've seen....can't do it.

No answer. The Plan he decides that a bad marriage will be his downfall. Okay, but how does one intentionally design a marriage to be so bad as to destroy oneself financially, emotionally, spiritually.**********MAJOR SPOILERS AHEAD***********************Since the antihero is handsome, rich, and outgoing he could easily marry one of any number of women, most of whom would jump at the chance. Many of these theoretical matches might possibly work out. No, no...there's got to be a worse way. I know the man must marry a complete stranger found via a newspaper ad placed in a foreign country. That's it. And to lessen the probability that she is compatible with the man, the woman must arrive in the man's country no more than 3 hours before the wedding takes place. The man and woman must know nothing about one another except the lies they've exchanged with each other in establishing contact via the mail.Okay, now here's the shocker. Are you ready for this. Hold on to your seat. Despite these elaborate plans to undermine the marriage from the start, the marriage does not in fact work out and the man is destroyed financially, emotionally and spiritually. What I have just related is the precise opening premise this movie expects you swallow in order to grab your attention for the movie's remainder. If it sounds implausible to the point of imbecility, well, that is not my fault.To be fair, although this movie in no way deserves it, the woman he marries is a con artist(Jolie) who has helped kill the actual intended bride and assumed her identity. But that absolutely doesn't matter, because it may just as well have been the con artist who answered the  man's marriage ad as any other woman.I really can't discuss this movie much further...the level of irritation Original Sin caused me makes it out of the question. Let me just say that the account I've related so far is not the most implausible element in the movie. For example, let's assume for the sake of argument that you are a psychopath. Somebody tells you they love you a total of 999 times. But you are a psychopath and it has no effect. So you decide to poison the person who loves you. Hey, it's what psychopaths do. Somehow the person finds out you've poisoned their drink and they tell you. Right before the person drinks the poison they tell you for the 1000th time that they love you. They knowingly begin to drink the poison. Suddenly, the scales of psychopathology fall from your eyes and you see everything in a different light. You spring to your feet with all the good-hearted innocence that a recently cured criminally insane person can muster and try to knock the poisoned drink from their hands.Here are the crucial questions Do you find this plausible? Possible? Psychologically realistic? If so, let me state in the strongest possible terms This movie was made for you.Hey, I just had a revelation. I just remembered a worse movie I saw Ed Wood's Love Feast, aka Pretty Models All In a Row. I knew I could do it!!

It is made very clear that this, in no way, was a love story, but a story about love.  It seems that the main point of the movie was to show how love gets into your every pore, where it makes a person incapable of being outside the intoxication of their complement.  Although this idea is both romantic and great in theory, seeing it on screen was a bit sickening. Even the summary on the back of the dvd made me feel uncomfortable and nauseated. Angelina Jolie does an excellent job with this monstrosity.

In fact, having seen the Tomb Rider recently, and bearing in mind Girl interrupted, because of Jolie alone I had some mild expectations going to see this summer afternoon time killer. Alas, what a mistake.A female beauty is really not a matter for discussion because everyone has his/her own taste, but I can't sway away the feeling that there is a way too much hype about Jolie's physical appearance than can be justified. A nice woman, but nothing more. As for her acting, she somehow fit into the roles of a schizophrenic or a comic/computer game type of characters, however, as la femme fatale she completely fails. Rapid transformations from a cold blooded rascal to a passionate volcano leave the sensation more of a sitcom style parody then some subtle introspective struggle of her character. Stick to Lara, Angie.Would someone tell me what it is about Banderas that they keep hiring him over and over again? Ok, he looks good and throws that sexy broken English at us, but come on the guy can't act. It's as simple as that nothing more, nothing less. Pass.The story, ah the story of this 'movie', I guess there is more sense in answers to Jay Leno's questions in Jay Walking. Absolutely unimaginative and absolutely absurd and absolutely boring from the beginning to the end. If you make through it without dozing off at least a couple of times, than you're either a single lecherous 17-year old with a thing for Jolie or a bodyguard on duty. Several examples why would a con team choose a poor Cuban clerk as their victim, as he described himself in the ad? what is the purpose of that charade with a private detective impersonation? how come they rent huge houses all over Cuba while being looked for by the police as the biggest public enemies? would a modest righteous monk agree to help a death row convict assuming serious consequences for himself, only after hearing her not-so-convincing story without any repentance? An so on, and so on, there's more, and some of it I surely missed due to the drowsiness.Other elements of the whole project barely jut out from the swill. The soundtrack is nothing close to what it might have been given the plot time and location. The scenery is again a disappointment given the huge opportunity to capitalize on the Caribbean surroundings. Instead, we mostly get the rundown backyards of big Cuban houses. The way the supporting characters are pictured as well as the nameless Cuban natives stenches miles away of the obsolete bourgeois colonial treatment which focuses exclusively on the petty preoccupations of the lame main characters.The end is more than annoying, not to use any stronger word. After seeing movies with tragic ending, one feels either sadness for the loss or the sense of helplessness for the inevitable. After seeing happy end movies, usually one feels relieved and optimistic. With this movie, one feels disappointed - that everyone gets away after choking the audience to death for almost two hours.1/10 "},{"Title":"Love Is Blind","Date":"30 June 2006","Score":"15 out of 29 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama, Mystery, Romance","Review":" Here's a steamy film - at least early on - about a Cuban (Antonio Bandaras_ who marries an American woman he had only previously written to, only to find out later she (Angelina Jolie) wasn't that woman but a scheming impostor (Billy Bob found this out in real life!)

Jolie is difficult to visualize as a mail order bride but the relationship is just a sexual tease and boring erotica. The ending is also difficult to swallow when factoring in issues of trust.

When we first meet Luis Vargas (Antonio Banderas) and Julia Russell (Angelina Jolie), there is the inescapable feeling that neither would have trouble finding a mate. We are half correct.This story has a number of twists in it, twists that I won't divulge so that the viewer's journey is more enjoyable. Luis owns a coffee plantation in Cuba. He falls in love with Julia. Their lives seem idyllic until the young woman disappears. The romance now becomes a mystery. In his efforts to discover what happened to Julia, Luis crosses paths with those of the lower social strata, shall we say, and his love propels him to make choices that he never would have dreamed of in his pre-Julia days.Along the way, the story of Original Sin takes a turn near Vertigo then continues on its winding way into unforeseen areas. The plot involves mistaken identities, a few red herrings, and some major grifting. In the end, all the piece of this puzzle come together, leaving us with a tale about love, faith and, maybe, redemption.The entire journey is lovingly filmed in some beautiful Mexican settings. The two lovers are beautiful in their own rights and the camera dwells on their images as part of the lush environs. But Banderas and Jolie are more than pretty faces; their acting is convincing. For the most part, the other actors also feel like they inhabit the places and times of Original Sin.Anything more I might say about this film could reveal some plot lines, so I will just say I give it a score of 7 out of 10.

She duly arrives in the form of Angelina Jolie. When she asks him why he wanted an American wife he answers, Here we are the past and there you are the future.He marries her, finds that he really loves her, is then deceived and robbed by her, seeks revenge but falls in love with her again only to be enmeshed in her deceitful lifestyle. It was a tall order to make it all work; the film bites off more than it can chew then chews like crazy for the rest of it's running time.Original Sin has enough packed into its 116 minutes to provide the material for a six-hour mini-series. The film is based on Waltz Into Darkness, a novel by Cornell Woolrich, who must rank just behind William Shakespeare for producing the largest number of works that have been turned into film.Original Sin is fast-paced, beautifully photographed, and features two charismatic stars &#x96; it all works perfectly as long as you just go along with it. Where the film runs into trouble is in consistency of tone, especially in the second half. But even if the only consistent tone in Original Sin is Angelina Jolie's nail enamel, part of the fascination is seeing how the filmmakers manage to get the story out of the many corners they have painted it into.One thing is for sure, Angelina Jolie dominates the screen. The filmmakers also showed a fascination with those famous lips; so much so that a couple of sequences start with a close-up of her lips before the camera pulls back to reveal the whole scene. In fact, she is photographed to great advantage in this film, and her Victorian era costumes suit her so well she looks as though she could sit for a portrait by John Singer Sargent the moment the director called cut.The interaction between Jolie and Banderas is fascinating and actually carries the movie over the rough spots in the plot. Calm and controlled, their performances have considerable depth despite the mounting implausibilities of the story. A couple of the supporting roles are also interesting; Australian Jack Thompson, who did brisk business around this time playing portly Southern gentlemen, plays Vargas' friend who warns him against Jolie's character. The other is Thomas Jane who plays a detective in a somewhat bizarre role.Original Sin is a throwback to an era in Hollywood filmmaking when the audience accepted a fairly far-fetched plot as long as it was wrapped in the gloss of fabulous stars and a lavish production. Anyone looking for reality in film can forget this one, but the two attractive stars light up the screen, and despite everything that has gone before, it has a satisfying ending that brings a smile to the face.

Yes, the obligatory Banderas-Jolie sex scene sizzles. But after that the movie fizzles out completely. The heat goes out of this movie very early on. The story relies on myriad plot twists which never really convince or satisfy. The dialogue is awkward throughout, often downright laughable. The acting leaves much to be desired. Banderas and Jolie are not very good. But they're better than Thomas Jane who, in the movie's one key supporting role, hams it up to ridiculous extent. There are a few interesting moments sprinkled throughout. But not nearly enough of them to save what is ultimately a rather bad movie.The movie's story is told in flashback with Jolie's character, Julia, narrating. She does so from a prison where she is awaiting execution. How did she get there? Should be interesting finding out. Should be but really isn't. The story unfolds in 19th century Cuba with the Banderas character, Luis, having sent for a mail-order bride. Julia duly arrives from Delaware but she is not the woman in the photograph she had sent ahead of her arrival. She is not the woman she claimed to be but Luis is not who he claimed to be either, much wealthier than he had let on. But while it becomes apparent that Luis truly has the best of intentions it is just as clear that Julia is a woman with some demons and secrets. What darkness lies beneath the surface? Detective Walter Downs, played by Jane, shows up to help Luis sort out the mess Julia makes. From here the story relies on tricks. But you can see the twists and turns coming a mile away. There's nothing to surprise you. There's really very little of interest at all. The story limps along towards its conclusion. Yes, we find out why Julia's in that prison cell. But by the time we do most in the audience will find they really don't care anymore. The movie has completely lost its hold on us. And then as a final insult the ending is just ludicrously stupid, a tacked-on bit of nonsense which undercuts the whole movie. Not that there was very much worthwhile to be undercut anyway.

(unless of course the novelist was the screen writer like Michael Blake with Dances with Wolves) Original Sin feels like somewhat familiar territory. I cannot quite pin point a film off the back of my head which used this idea. I suppose though, that if labelled an erotic thriller anyone can name fifty films off the back of their heads. I think I can see Original Sin working as a novel. As a movie though, it has some storytelling problems, which depending on your attention span may weaken the experience. I am reminded a bit of Basic Instinct. What we have here a sexy and erotic game which sort of goes in circles. Original Sin is the superior movie in part because it is more beautiful, the sex is less distracting, Banderas and Jolie are a better screen couple, and the ending of the movie is a nice touch.Set in Havana, in what looks like the late 19th century. The curtain rises on the luxurious home of Don Luis Vargas. He has recently mail ordered a bride from the states, who shows up the next day. Her name is Julia. They are married in the sunshine of a beautiful afternoon, and they are happy. A few days later however, Julia disappears. Not only that but Luis' bank accounts have been cleared. Not only that, but he finds out that the girl he married is not the Julia Russell he has been sending letters to in the months leading up to their wedding. Oh and not only THAT but the real Julia may have been killed at this woman's hand. suddenly Vargas is in the middle of a very dangerous game, once he goes looking for his apparent wife.The film is sprinkled with several contrived twists and turns, which are typical of almost all thrillers. It is not inventive in the least, but it IS aesthetically evocative, and fairly engaging. In the same way Titanic was a contemporary love story set a hundred years ago, Original Sin is a contemporary erotic-thriller set around the same time (give or take a couple of decades) It turns out to be not bad, there is certainly room for improvement, but it's watchable.

Thomas Jane as antagonist keeps up the high-calibre acting. The script twists and turns without ever letting down its theme, the redeeming power of love. What stops Original Sin from being great is the camera-work and editing. In one scene in a brothel the 360- degree pan distorts the edges of the frame and induces nausea.

The director is overly fixated on 'creating the scene'. As the film takes place in Cuba sometime well in the past (maybe the late 19th century?), it's understandable to flaunt the romance of the setting, but it comes off like a slutty romance novel. Of course the erotic scenes with Jolie and Banderas (and later other men), only add to that feeling.The purpose of the music is to add to the mystique and romance of old Cuba even more. The problem is that while it's adding to the setting, it's hurting the story. This movie is supposed to be a bit of a thriller, and music is always a big part of creating suspense in film. The music here just doesn't get the job done, and it really hurts the flow of the movie.Because of all these issues this movie really drags. A lot more footage should have been chopped in the editing room, but its redemption is that if you wait long enough, you find it does have a point and a good one at that. The melodrama never really leaves, but the story nonetheless comes together in the end. I can't say I'd particularly recommend it, but it's watchable if you're patient.

I would highly recommend reading the novella, but this movie, sad to say, simply stinks.It seems like the director and producers didn't care much for consistency or flow.  Neither Angelina Jolie nor Antonio Banderas keeps the same accent throughout the film - a little detail that is quite annoying.  In addition, the movie is broken up by obviously slapped together stock footage (eg - the now we travel to Havana scene) in places where, I suppose, they must have run low on production funds.  This, needless to say, significantly interfered with my attempts at a suspension of disbelief.All the production funds must have been spent on all the diffuse-lit footage they got of Angelina Jolie and Antonio Banderas in bed - but that's a pity - because that footage was mostly gratuitous and not necessary to the plot of the film at all.  The novella doesn't elaborate on any of this, and it makes its points about obsessive love quite nicely anyway.This could have been a good movie.  The cast wasn't terrible (Antonio Banderas does the desperate, melodramatic romantic hero very well, and that is what the film called for.  Also, kudos to villian Jack Thompson who was a worthy bad guy.) and the script wasn't even that bad with screenwriter/director Cristopher adding an interesting plot twist that isn't in the book.I'd guess the potential of this film was ruined by somebody who thought more pictures of naked body parts would be a bigger selling point than the credibility and continuity of the picture.  Whoever they were, they were dead wrong.  We know Cristopher can do good work, and that Angelina Jolie can do it with him (Cristopher directed her in Gia for which she won a Golden Globe)...but this time something went way wrong. Bummer.I give this movie a big fat D.  "},{"Title":"Been done before, been done better","Date":"5 August 2002","Score":"","Genre":"Drama, Mystery, Romance","Review":"  Predictability=bad.  Some movies can be predictable but still so enjoyable that you don't mind.  Original Sin is not one of them.  The characters are cut and pasted from any similar movie you've ever seen, with nothing to redeem them.  Considering the talent involved, this was rather disappointing.  The plot was just as one dimensional and predictable.Aside from the blah characters and blah plot, my biggest pet peeve was the film editing.  I don't know enough technical stuff to ascribe a name to it, but the movie was edited similarly to Traffic, with a couple random seconds of film tossed out here and there.  In Traffic, this worked really well.  It just seemed to fit.  In Original Sin, I got a mental picture of a twelve year old with a reel and pair of scissors shouting whee.  When the movie is (I think, though I couldn't be sure) going for a deadly smooth kind of mood, jerking the film around doesn't help anything.There are a couple of funny moments in this movie, and in one or two places there is a palpable sense of eroticism that is excellent.  In particular, the first love scene is very well done.  Still, this movie is bad.

Cristofer has convinced me that no has, or maybe will, use Angelina Jolie (if one CAN actually 'use' her) better. He gets her...in all her sexuality, danger and, more importantly, vulnerability. Of all people to keep me from seeing this theatrically, it was Banderas casue of a string of bad choices. Well, this was mine, cause he was everything he became a star for...alluring, charismatic and dangerous, as well. I seem to be rather singular in my admiration of this film but I'll take the critical burning. The themes of being loved, or more precisely, the fear of being loved and the difficulties of accepting it when it's true are truly, and nastily, addressed here. I don't think this film should be overlooked for it's sexuality or just because it's attractive...how far these characters are willing to go to get, and get away from, love is not exaggurated in the slightest. At it's core it is saying that to get to honesty and trust takes alot more than words.  It takes sacrifice and work.

Their trepidation would have been less than paranoid -- seldom in the United States has there been a film so unanimously and entertainingly battered by the critics. While the bulk of their boastings were hilarious to read almost all of them noted that Waltz Into Darkness, Cornell Woolrich's 1947 novel on which the film is based, was much more delicately represented in Francois Truffaut's 1969 film Mississippi Mermaid.Frankly, to compare the two is a bit like comparing Fellini's Romeo and Juliet to Baz Luhrmann's -- different approaches, different reasons for existing and, most importantly, different generations of audience, with very different expectations as to what makes a film swing. I enjoyed the hell out of Original Sin, mostly because I'm simply not convinced Michael Cristofer didn't receive the howls of outrage and laughter with a kinky sense of satisfaction.Original Sin is set in Cuba in the 19th century, where Luis Varga (Antonio Banderas), a rich Cuban entrepreneur, is pleased but perplexed when the American woman he's been corresponding with, and who's just arrived to marry him, isn't the plain Julia Russell whose photo he'd received, but instead the gorgeous and seductive Angelina Jolie. He believes her story about not wanting him to have been interested in her for her looks alone, and they quickly wed. Cracks appear immediately in the more than satisfactory scene Luis finds in his lap; a letter from Julia's sister complaining that Julia hasn't written, then a private detective, Walter Downs (Thomas Jane) appears looking for her. By this point, Luis has begun to notice strange anomalies regarding his own luscious-lipped Julia. She never bothers to unpack her trunk -- always a disturbing sign early in a relationship. She seems to rather like coffee, despite having once written him that she hated the stuff. Most worrying of all, Julia has an unhealthy interest in the Mephisto of a travelling theatrical troupe. Luis begins to follow her as she wanders through the streets and ducks around corners. From there the plot enters twist after turn until finally contorting into a structure that would have amazed M.C. Escher, and I haven't seen an audience react with such howls of cheesy delight since Jeremiah S. Chechik's overblown 1996 cliffhanger, Diabolique.That Original Sin curves to the melodramatically outrageous should not come as a surprise to fans of pulp American post-war romance (which is, in fact, all Waltz Into Darkness ever was). Nor should it come as a particular shock to anyone who sits through the first half-hour of Original Sin, during which Michael Cristofer furnishes us with visions of how far he is prepared to go in the name of entertainment. Opulent scenes of a corrupted Cuban paradise abound, with all the burlesque and choreographed decadence of Luhrmann's Paris or Fellini's Vienna aristocratic cloth billows in slow motion as children beetle through streets festooned with transvestites. And all through the eye of a lens that sweeps in a contemplative, panoramic arc. It's a bit much, no doubt about it, but I suspect there's a tongue in a cheek behind that lens -- the dolly slides just that little bit slower than that of the humourless Europeans who've been moving festival snobs to standing ovations for years. In any case, it's fun to watch. We don't have these big screens just for Taco Bell commercials.So now to the sex, the stuff that earned Original Sin it's R rating and where Cristofer's over-the-top attention to styling becomes a spectacle indeed.As a director, Cristofer has been stalking Angelina Jolie for years. He made no bones about his fascination with her various features in 1999's Gia, and in Original Sin he's all over her like a pox. Her body is the plot pivot, and we see so many lingering close-ups of those incredible lips of hers its a wonder they didn't get a billing of their own. If Cameron Mannheim had been cast as Julia this would have been a grave mistake. With Jolie, it's a gift to the audience -- her dental airbags are a work of art.Most of the sex is either styles, sweltering nudity (Jolie and Banderas both) or implied (finger sucked in close up, wandering hands all atremble) but, when it becomes full-blown bedroom stuff, Cristofer uses everything at his disposal to make the lengthy experience swallow us whole. It's basically a foursome with a camera and boom mic (one reviewer referred to Banderas and Jolie's loud and passionate kissing sounding like a couple of preschoolers woofing down greasy hamburgers) and it's really a credit to the stars that they didn't either burst out laughing or worse (if Billy Bob Thornton has a temper at all, Banderas would no longer be with us, I'm sure). At one point, Jolie and Banderas strike a passionate position that I don't believe is quite possible (although I'll get back to you on that). Once again, it's all very syrupy, slippery arthouse stuff but I doubt anyone really wants to see trains going into tunnels or chimneys collapsing backwards these days and, if it's raw grit you want, check out the Canberra video circuit.Film critics come over all troubled when filmmakers mess with novels, which is pretty rich when the novel in question is a forgettable two-dollar paperback. They also come over all pious when a film made in the name of fun does not respect historical and geographical context, particularly when you're talking about Cuba, knowledge of which is surely the most smarmy medal on the name-dropping leftist's lapel. I suppose if aliens ever do come to Earth, films like Star Wars will have their film critics steaming inside their alfoil skivvies.Basically, Original Sin is a bad film to see if you are interested in matters such as fidelity to the novel, or whether Cuba is portrayed with the historical accuracy of a Mikheil Kalatozishvili flick. If you're into Jolie (as all men and most women are) or Banderas (as some men and some women are) and films so escapist they make you laugh out loud at the sheer absurdity of it all, Original Sin is a great night out.As a first date, I believe it might be unbeatable.

Luis, blinded by the great sex, (as we men are prone to) stupidly goes and puts Julia's name on all his bank accounts. Julia disappears, leaving Luis with about $65. Gee, Didn't see that coming did you?  Luis decides he is going to devote himself to hunting her down and killing her, then the story takes some interesting twists and turns, and we find out that Julia isn't really the bad girl at all, she's totally controlled by someone else. We feel for Jolie's character, that's for sure.Luis genuinely loves Julia, and it would seem that the controlled Julia honestly has fallen in love with Luis. So, how can they be together when Julia is ordered to kill Luis? You'll have to see the movie to find out, I won't give it all away.Instead, I shall discuss the scenes.  The scenery, the story set in Cuba has great sets, there are numerous elaborate looking houses, all set to a period long ago. The place sure looks like it would be nice. Of course, it's only in the movies.SEX!  Umm, the sex scenes I mean.  OK, so we get to see Angelina's Boobs, they aren't all bouncing all over the place, instead we get some tastefully done love scenes between her and Antonio. Guys will have to endure seeing Antonio's butt in order to see Angelina's boobs, not a bad trade off. But, this wasn't a film which left me needing to go home and change my underwear.  The number of nudey scenes aren't even that many, and this isn't terribly disappointing. I had expected some big time erotic thriller story, but instead, was left with more of a love story with some sex and killings thrown in. How about that acting?  Seemed awful good to me. What I did find nice was how this film is narrated at points by Angelina's character while she is telling a priest her story as she waits to be executed in Jail. You are left to wonder throughout most of the film, OK, what did she do? Who does she kill? How did she get caught? It is my opinion that the narration and the incarceration helped the film, rather than took away from it. It kept the audience with questions.Most of these things will be answered. We don't know exactly why she is thrown in jail to be executed, but it could be one of a few things. We also must assume she is caught when trying to save the one she loves. Finally putting her love of someone above what she has been forced to do for so long, and her own self preservation. Antonio plays the left behind lover filled with rage very well, and we see the internal strife he must combat when he finally catches up with Julia, does he love her enough to not kill her? Of course. Does he want her back? Of course. Shortly after catching up with her, there is a GREAT scene where he answers the door. Well worth not spoiling it by giving it away.The Private Investigator or Billy  He is convincing to Luis as someone who is there to help him, but really has ulterior motives. He is evil, he needs to die, and needs to die a slow painful death. See, he had that kind of effect on me, therefore, his performance was very well done. God, I really love Angelina Jolie's lips, don't you think she can do a real good you know what? I'm sure she swallow everything.The implied gang rape.  Sure, it isn't shown, and that's a good thing. But I abhor rape, and found it not necessary to the story in the least bit. The Cutting.  Julia/Bonnie has some scars on her back. We even see another line added to her four scars, but we don't really know what the point of them is. If it is a way of keeping track of how many men she's seduced and stolen their money, it sure seems stupid. Finally.....  I would say that Original Sin will come and go from the theater in another week or so do to terrible marketing, and judging by the size of the audience, terrible ticket sales. This is to bad, Original Sin is a decent film which would better fit in the winter film line up.Oh, and one more thing.  It is just amusing to hear how often who-res are brought up in the film. Someone even tells Luis to just go get a good who-re and everything will be better.

If nudity offends you, or you like to `get your kicks above the waistline' (with thanks to Murray Head), give Original Sin a wide berth. No matter what the serpents may tell you, the worms in this apple are not a value-added source of protein. Directed by Michael Cristofer, who brought Angelina Jolie to the world's attention with Gia, this is a ham-fisted attempt at an erotic thriller with film noir pretensions that falls well short of the mark. Based on a novel by pulp fiction writer Cornell Woolrich (who also gave rise to Hitchcock's Rear Window), Original Sin is simply trash with a highly paid cast and the odd bit of nice cinematography. Luis Antonio Vargas (Banderas) is a Cuban in the coffee trade, who has decided that it is time to take a wife. Uninterested in affairs of the heart, he places an advertisement in an American newspaper, thus contacting a young, plain, Christian girl named Julia Russell, who agrees to travel to Cuba and become his wife. Waiting at the dock, Vargas is surprised when he is approached by a beautiful young woman who claims to be Julia (Jolie). Julia admits to having misled Luis, sending the photo of a much plainer woman, so that she could be assured that he was truly interested in marriage, and not just a (very) pretty face. Somewhat taken aback, Luis admits that he has also lied &#150; he is not a clerk for a coffee company, he actually is a part owner &#150; he wanted to be sure that her intentions were not monetary. Before the shock fully subsides, the couple rush off to be married immediately, and the businesslike Luis quickly finds himself falling headlong into love and lust with his new bride. For those of you who need to have it spelt out, this is the part of the story where they &#145;get it on' with a series of shots and close-ups that are (believe it or not) overlong and overtly revealing. If this is what you paid for, you'll certainly get your money's worth, with a series of revealing images of the beautiful pair in various states of post-coital bliss. Unfortunately, there's still about 90 minutes of the film left to go. You may want to walk out now. Of course, all is not well in this paradise, and Cristofer leaves clues and foreboding signs across the next 15 minutes like banana skins at a Clown's Convention. Luis couldn't be happier, until people begin to start asking questions and he wakes one day to find that his wife has cleared their joint accounts and done a runner. Still hopelessly in love, Luis decides to track her down with the help of a private investigator employed by the &#145;real' Julia's sister. At this point, Banderas runs through the rest of the script with a big &#145;Kick Me&#133; Again' sign taped to his back. Angelina Jolie gives a pretty good account of herself in this villainous, femme fatale role, adding a certain amount of haughty spite and vitriol to the talents that puberty blessed her with. However, neither she nor Banderas has the charisma to pull themselves from the quagmire of this sorry, sordid tale. There is one scene, quite early on in the film, in which Luis and Julia head off to the theatre to see a touring American theatre company presenting (without much subtlety) Faust. They are accompanied by Luis' business partner and his wife, who describes the production as cheap melodrama. Julia, obviously thrilled with the production (for reasons that become apparent later) retorts that she likes cheap melodrama. While the director may have meant this as a dig at the critics, all he really did was write Original Sin's review for them. By all accounts, this film has bombed miserably in the U.S. and given the costs of period drama, it is unlikely to have recouped its expenses. Plastic surgeons, on the other hand, probably made a packet from the extensively altered Melanie Griffiths after she saw her hubby getting his on-screen Jolies.  Yes, it's a cheap shot &#150; but it's a cheap film. SABIAN WILDE.

But it has certainly been a good one, although it wasn't that understandable. Angelina Jolie was amazing as Julia Russel and Bonnie Castle. This woman really knows how to act. What an excellent actress!!. She is beautiful as well as clever. As for Antonio Banderas, he was outstanding and dashing to play Luis Vargas. Original sin has a very good cast; However the plot wasn't as great as I thought it was going to be. Many odd things happen over the course of the story, that's why many people didn't like it.  Nevertheless look at the scenery, costumes and musical score, they are very flashy. I never thought Hollywood producers could have made a film like this in Spanish countries like Cuba. It's extremely interesting and highly recommended by me. It's important that people learn a little bit of other countries like Cuba, Mexico, etc. Angelina Jolie and Antonio Banderas made it worth watching, especially Angelina since she got an academy award for best actress in a leading role in Girl interrupted. She showed us her wonderful talent.The story is about a rich man Luis Vargas who wants to get married to an honest woman. He meets a mysterious American woman Julia Russell (whose true name is Bonnie Castle). He marries her, but Luis's marriage does not bring him the happiness he so desires. His headstrong love for her proves no match against her manipulations and deceives. Julia is always lying to him; however she finally falls in love with him because she realizes that Luis is absolutely in love with her even if she is a duplicitous person. Many things can happen at the ending. It depends on you to be either amazed or disappointed. I was kind of both things. I was amazed as well as disappointed, but I can really say that it was a very different love story that had the weirdest and happy original ending. 8/10   "}{"Title":"I thought it was good.","Date":"28 October 2001","Score":"","Genre":"Drama, Mystery, Romance","Review":"  I am confused as to how I can like this movie so much and everyone else that I know hates it.

What I saw was an awful film with some very banal dialogue and affected performances from Jolie and Jane (sounds like a new double act). Angelina Jolie is certainly a good actress as witnessed by 'Girl, Interrupted' and can play a plausible seductress as in 'Pushing Tin' but here she is simply unbelievable as someone who can manipulate men without effort or conscience. She and Thomas Jane seem to play their parts from the view of what they think the audience expects, so that they are performing parts and not acting at all. Antonio Bandaras is the only one of the main parts who shows a naturalism and it is a shame to see Jack Thompson wasted in a small and unimportant role. The basic story is interesting and certainly the sets, costumes and music lend the film good production values.

She is more sexy than Marilyn Monroe, shockingly beautiful and also has tremendous acting ability.  This movie dies whenever she is not in it.  It is worth it just to see her handling of the role.  The film itself seems to be Hitchcock like at moments and is interesting to watch but at moments degenerates.  Unfortunately as it progresses it all seems so pointless.  The film almost turns to comedy near the end and the end for me was a real failure and flop.Antonio Banduras was also excellent in his role and their acting elevated this film which would not be worth watching without Banduras and Jolie.  Angelina Jolie seems like such a nice, sincere, and honest person that it would be nice to see her in some roles that reflect her instead of a continuing string of neurotic roles.  I know she mentioned she want to play more action roles which would be fine also.  But she should also be given some roles in which she could show her abilities in which I am sure she could eventually take home the Oscar beyond the one she recently got for Best Supporting Actress.

Her wide eyes, at-ease stare, evincing no effort to judge, suggest you just look at her and there's nothing more to know.The character she plays is somewhat less than this, and that is too sad. But then, there are women who, raised in poverty, were required to learn con games.  And, so, Jolie has been chosen to portray them.  Personally, I'd rather meet the Jolie outside of this movie.As it has been so far no Jolie, only movie.PLOT SPOILERThe plot is written from humor, one must understand that.  Probably no one ever puts out an ad for love claiming to be much poorer than they are! ...The theme of the movie is in favor of love, which is agreeable enough for a theme.  You don't walk away from love, says the Banderas character often. The story illustrates this by two men who both believe they are in love with this woman and are not willing to get over her.  The illustration places this moral in doubt.  You would wish you would be able to walk away from a woman who is no longer interested in you or your deal (Thomas Jane) or who has schemed against and stolen from you (Antonio Banderas).On a background of pleasing scenery and architecture and gratifying sexual endeavors, the movie's glib humor comes with ease.I wouldn't bother reading reviews.

It was with hesitation and angst because I really didn't think there was much to look forward to in the film.  The trailers didn't make it look overly appealing and to be honest I really didn't hear much from the stars in the promotion department.  But, today it is about 45 degrees here in Toronto ( that is about 110 for our metrically challenged American friends ) and even though I had pretty much seen everything else, the idea of spending 2 hours in an air conditioned theater and only paying six dollars to see the film, appealed to me.  So I did.  And to be honest, I can't decide if it is a film that I enjoyed or I despised or if it is somewhere in between.  There were times when I was mildly interested, times when I was emotionally involved and there were many times when I was completely apathetic to it.  So what do I say about a film that makes me feel so much yet so little.  Well it was better than many of the teen gross out comedies that have come out in the past few years and not as good as almost every other film I have seen.  So that means it rates around a 6 out of 10.Spoilers ahead!The film is about deceit and how love can blind you and make you do silly and/or stupid things.  Antonio Banderas has it all at the beginning of this film.  He is a handsome man that enjoys the fruits of his coffee business and he is now looking forward to meeting his new bride that he sent away for from the U.S. ( leave it up to those damn Americans to ruin everything ).  What was puzzling was why Jolie has a British accent if she was from Delaware or Maryland or wherever.  But no matter.  Jolie is that bride and when asked why she replied to newspaper about a Cuban that wanted a woman to marry and bear children, she replies that she is looking to forget the past and start a new future.  So they move on and get married that same day. The beginning of the film moves along at a snails pace.  For the first half an hour, nothing happened.  They met, they married, they had sex, in which we get to see lots of Jolie and her ample bosom, but it was actually quite boring.  Then something wonderful happens.  We find out that Jolie is not who she says she is and she has taken all of his money and left him, penniless and heart broken.  Now I was intrigued and for the next half an hour we get to see the deception involved.  Banderas goes to Havana to find her with the help of a detective from the U.S. and low and behold, he finds her in Havana.  They make up and then get back together and then the real deceit begins.Original Sin is good when there are elements of surprise flanking the story but incredibly mundane when they are telling the rest of the tale.  There are two many shots of Jolies' lips and to agree with some of the other reviewers in here, the editting in the film was bothersome and annoying.  I don't know why they would edit it that way except to think that they did it because it is like they were editting it the way someone tells a story, with deliberate breaks and rebeginnings.  Sort of like... and then she did this  and then he came to her and so on.  But the editting process was not at all done properly and no matter what effect they were going for, it failed miserably.Finally we get to the end where it makes the film sort of misunderstood, at least by me.  I couldn't understand what they were trying to tell the audience, and they were clearly talking to the audience as they looked straight into the camera and told their tale.  It reminded me a bit of The Usual Suspects in the sense that you are wondering if this was a story all told from the two leads point of view, therefore never knowing what was real and what was a fabrication.Original Sin is not a terrible film, it isn't a great film.  It is a little murky and if that is what they were going for then they succeeded beautifully.  I wouldn't want to see it again, even though there are many unanswered questions.  It was just too... strange.6 out of 10--  Not something you want to spend your money on in the summer time.  Bring on American Pie 2!!

It had melodrama. It had exotic places. It had SEX. You enjoyed it, because it took you to another place, but deep inside you knew that it was no more than so much fluff to pass the time. Now imagine making a movie out of one of these novels. Not high art, and it wasn't meant to be. But you might be intrigued enough, despite yourself, to check it out. Now, imagine the same adapted novel, with the star power of an Angelina Jolie and an Antonio Banderas. Now you want to go, don't you? And you don't care that the plot might be implausible, that the stuffier critics are thumbing their noses, and that the Academy is not impressed. So what? If `Original Sin' is a mere cinematic diversion, it is at least an entertaining diversion. And more than a small amount of credit for this should go to its headliners, Antonio Banderas and Angelina Jolie, who may go down in cinematic history as the unlikeliest pair to make use of a mail-order bride service. Luis Antonio Vargas (Banderas, suave as always), who is looking more for a bearer of his children than romance, is pleasantly surprised that his betrothed is much more fetching in person than the photo that he is carrying. Julia Russell (Jolie, demure one moment and sensual the next), in turn, is mildly taken aback that her husband-to-be is a wealthy part owner of a coffee bean plantation. Needless to say, a relationship built on misinformation and/or deception before it is even begun will not be without its share of&#133;difficulties. What soon follows this initial meeting and subsequent marital bliss is a series of incidents & acts of mistrust, double-cross, & complicity that one would expect to read in pulp fiction novels. Added to the mix is Walter Downs (Thomas Jane), an enigma with a ridiculous moustache who is introduced as a private investigator. He gives the faintest impression that there is more to him than meets the eye, yet his ulterior motives (if any) are unclear. Add these ingredients, the exotic locales, and the undeniable appeal of the lead actors, and you get something less than high art but more than the sum of its parts. Jolie is so mesmerizing and Banderas so charismatic, you'll just want to sit back & enjoy one of this summer's guilty pleasures. You do want to see it, don't you?

There is a lot of sexual content, and I fear many people will let their puritanical nature prejudice them towards the rest of the film because of it.  I wasn't bothered.  The acts performed by Jolie's character are extremely atypical for a supposedly innocent lady, but they would only be gratuitous if they were not within the bounds of her character--which has no bounds.  The powerful emotional outbursts which occur never seem forced, showing perhaps Baderas' and Jolie's skill at the craft.  I can't wait to see it a second time to see what I missed the first.

Granted, the editing was a little weird and a few things were left unsaid but thats what makes a film unique. If they all were the same word for word style of film, then it would get really boring.

But you don't have to be their fan to like this movie. It has a great plot (I would really like to read the novel it is based on), great performances and really good direction.  Plus, 19th century Cuba looks quite fascinating. The story is about a rich Cuban, Luis (Banderas, obviously) that is set on marrying an american woman.  He posts an add on a Boston (I think) newspaper, and he finally finds the bride of his dreams Miss Julia Russel, a not very pretty but young and strong woman that will give him an heir. But when Julia arrives, it is non other but Angelina Jolie, not quite like the picture Luis has of his bride to be. With this intriguing start, the plot gets thicker and thicker as love and passion, as well as treason, lie and crime come into the game, so you can never get bored.  The characters' acts seem a little unbelievable sometimes, but the tagline is how far would you go for love, so be prepared.

For those of you who haven't seen it I wont say anything else about the movie except for the solid acting by most of the cast the movie failed to entertain and left me disappointed. The director does an all right job of bringing this movie to the big screen but unfortunately the pacing is slow and the film could've been a lot better. The only reason I gave this movie four stars out of ten is because of the attempt by the actors and the very steamy sex scene between Banderas and Jolie that really pushes the R rating. If you're a fan of either of the stars than you might like this movie more than me. There are a few twists and surprises you might not see coming but then again you might expect it because I for one did. Despite the talent of Banderas and Jolie who try to bring life to the characters the same can go for Jane who does an okay job with the supporting role he does have the movie itself just isn't that great. The film does have strong sexual content, nudity, language, and some violence so this is no movie for parents to see with their kids at least not until their seventeen or over. Overall Original Sin isn't that good of a movie and you're better off watching something else. Unless your a kid who wants to see Jolie featured in a graphic sex scene and without her clothes on then this is the movie for you. Otherwise skip Original Sin and watch a better thriller that's worth watching more than once.

Antonio is the perfect romantic figure that the movie needed. On the other side he is aware what happens but lost himself in the love for Julia. This gives the tension between Antonio and Angelina which is an attractive aspect of the movie. Maybe you think this movie will be too romantic for some, but there is a good lot of tension in it.

This screenplay is quite interesting, and when Angelina Jolie leans ahead of the dead body and says Billy, you really got what you deserved this time, you're thinking oh, nice plot-twist. From the beginning of the movie until that moment, you are entertained. The problem is that right after that the body wakes up, and a lot of other, less interesting plot-twists ensue. After a while, you don't really care if Banderas' character is going to die or not because his character has lost all the respect you had of it; and you don't care about Jolie's character anymore either because of what she's tried to do in the film. Such a manipulative and untrustworthy character as her doesn't draw my interest, such a weak and unthinking character as he, doesn't either. Love, to me, isn't a trait of personality sufficient enough in a movie character so that I care about it. Therefore, when the only thing that remains in both these characters is the love for each other, and when they have left their jobs, friends, integrity, and should I say, mental sanity (because they become guilty of murder) to stay with each other, you can pretty much guess that from there the movie can become vulgar and raw. Which it does, when Angelina turns into a prostitute again at the end - not a least bit worried by the love she says she carries for Luis - and offers herself to 4 or 5 men, while she already has a relationship with Luis and one with her pimp. So in the end I'd say that the film is pretty graceful - gracefully written, acted, shot, though out - from the beginning to Billy, you got what you deserved, and after that it turns into something else, another type of movie which we could call the-plot-twist-contest-kind-of-movie. Unfortunately for that almost good part of the film, Angelina Jolie was cast as the main actress of Original Sin. Her blown-out of proportions lips invade the screen from the first seconds of the film, and sadly, her acting is proportionally emphasized. One can regret that she was chosen for the part, and while some may enjoy the view of her naked body, true film lovers will regret the choice of her for this role. Not a whisper from her, not a glance, could give a man goosebumps on his back. Everything from her, up to the register of her voice, is cold and slow. While Miss Jolie was compelling and true in a film like Girl, Interrupted, she is nothing here but a commercial value on the movie poster. An actress with such passionate eyes as Mia Kirschner's, or with a sin-inspiring body as Sherilyn Fenn's, could have saved the part very easily. But Angelina Jolie looks in no way like the character she portrays - and maybe simply doesn't fit with period dramas. The music plays unnoticed in the action's background - no theme remains in your mind after the end credits, no lyrical moments have flashed your ears - but then again, you didn't come see the film for its music did you? The cinematography comes where needed, as needed, with as little boldness as expected. No image from this film is sheerly beautiful or picturesque, but the sceneries and actions are properly lit and shot with imagination. If you hesitate between watching an old film and this, go for the old film!

A lot of the stuff that goes on in the film does not make sense nor look good but because it's Tony and Angie we're expected to either pardon it or just gulp it up. Too bad the Razzie people weren't buying it. There were so upset with Angie that year that they nominated her twice for worst actress for both this film and the first Tomb raider film. Maybe it was her accent in both films that ticked them off? I didn't buy her accent in this one either...Anywho, the film is about a rich Don (ala Zorro) who advertises for a wife from overseas and gets one, just not the one he ordered but falls in love with her anyway.

Two the sexiest stars in films today (Antonio Banderas and Angelina Jolie) fail to demonstrate even the slightest hint of sexual chemistry.  This is compensated for by an intriguing plot that deals with the nature of love.Luis (Banderas) is a rich Spanish aristocrat in the late 19th Century, who is eagerly seeking a wife to share his life with.  It comes in the form of shapely Julia (Jolie).  However, just a few weeks after marrying her, she takes off mysteriously and it quickly becomes apparent to Luis that she was not the poor peasant she said she was.He sets in pursuit of her, blinded and confused by both love and intense hatred of her.  Along the way he meets a private detective Walter (Thomas Jane), who is more involved with Julia than it first appears.The film is largely narrated in flashback by Julia, who relates her tale to a priest as she languishes in prison awaiting execution.  The script is adequate, but there is nothing especially spectacular about it to lift it above the norm for this kind of sexually charged thriller.  There are a good few twists and turns along the way but the inventive conclusion (where a principal character attempts suicide) is spoiled by a predictable cop-out happy ending.The core of this film is the relationship between Luis and Julia.  Banderas and Jolie are well-cast but, in spite of couple vigourous sex scenes, they have no chemistry together.  Banderas, despite an occasional moment of flippant humour, seems to be going through the motions and makes no real attempt to get to grip with the exciting complexities of his role.  Jolie, to the delight of her many male fans, does go nude in a couple of scenes, and it is she who delivers the best principal performance in the picture.  Thomas Jane completes the trio as the scheming villain, and he does bring a certain element of threat to the picture.In conclusion, the film is not too bad.  The plot and occasionally quirky script ensure it does hold the interest throughout.  However, the lack of chemistry between the two leads mean the film is not everything it could have been.   "},{"Title":"What a piece of junk","Date":"21 December 2002","Score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama, Mystery, Romance","Review":"  I watched this movie with very low expectation, and came out disappointed.With 30 minutes or so into the film, I thought to myself, OK, this is one of those slow sudsy plots that doesn't have much going on except for the great settings, lots of music scores to fill in the void and gratuitous nude scenes.  Inserted in it were a few blatant attempt to warn the viewer to remember such and such an event with the emphasis on specific scenes like the prolonged shot on the suitcase or the signing of the account.  You think to yourself, OK, signs to the logically challenged, but lets leave judgement until later.But when the suspicion started to rise with the appearance of the sister and private investigator, things started to fall apart with plot holes developing left and right.  With scenes where when both the sister and investigator appeared around the same time, it did not occur to Luis, played by Antonio Banderas, to inquire about the investigator to the sister, since it was supposedly her that hired the him in the first place.There were so many ham fisted attempt to lure the viewer to notice what is coming up and clumsy setup to many scenes of deception.  They included scenes where the bird died with a broken neck right after Julia, played by Angelina Jolie, complained about the bird's singing, and then they show her in the next room singing.  The restaurant scene with the newspaper and the so obvious clue they are throwing at our face.  Or the poker scene where the wife walks all around looking at other people's cards while serving drinks, and making blatant signs as if nobody know why she keeps making the throat slitting gesture.Why would she need to turn off the lamp after Luis is dead so the other man could sneak in?  Isn't it easier just to go downstairs and open the door?  Of course, the whole escape and ensuing chase would not occur if it was done in that more logical way.  And doesn't Luis know the gun was loaded with blanks when he went to reload his it and saw the unused bullets?  Why did the plot keep going that way, even with him asking Julia about how did the investigator survive him being gunned down, and her telling the gun was loaded with blanks.There were so many instances with the intention of leading the viewer so that they are always a few steps ahead of the clueless Luis, this becomes one of those cheap horrors where everyone except him knows what is going to happen.  That included Julia telling Luis to report the murder while she cleans pack up and for them to run away as fugitives, but at the same time telling him not to touch the body, just so that it won't be revealed that there wasn't any penetration by bullets.  Why is she trying to shoo him away when she herself did not know the man was dead.  The whole concept of not touching the body so as to leave no evidence, while reporting the murder, having the body disposed of, going off selling all your assets and being on the run as a fugitive when there is apparently nobody after you totally throws whatever little logic that the plot had out the window.  The holes, inconsistencies and cringes goes on and on.The acting by Angelina Jolie is so bad, with her bi-polar personality and one second shoot me if you dare, and next second breaking down, it is unbearable.The pacing is not consistent, with altering melodrama and deception, breaking any continuity and buildup of suspense.  Resulting in a movie that drags on and on.The only thing that might have been good is the cinematography in the beginning, which helped pass the time of their sappy romancing.

Original Sin is hardly original in that regard. Never mind what the credits claim this movie is based upon. Director Michael Cristofer has merely remade Francois Truffaut's Mississippi Mermaid...while throwing in a bit of Truffaut's Such a Gorgeous Kid Like Me for good measure.Unfortunately, Cristofer is not Truffaut. What's worse is that Cristofer seems to understand this only too well. Lacking Truffaut's cinematic style and ability to create suspense, Cristofer tries to shock us with graphic images instead. Oh sure, most men will appreciate seeing Angelina Jolie nude and most women will enjoy seeing the many shots of Antonio Banderas' rear. But do we really need to see Billy spit into Bonny's mouth? Or cut notches into her back?The rest of Original Sin suffers from comparisons to Mississippi Mermaid as well. Antonio Banderas doesn't even come close to being Jean-Paul Belmondo. And Angelina Jolie's beauty and talent both pale next to that of Catherine Deneuve.Worst of all, once again we must suffer through an Americanized ending. I swear, one day Hollywood will do a remake of Romeo and Juliet and have them both survive in the end. After all, that is what the test audience will demand.Too bad the test audience for this one didn't say Ah, forget it Cristofer. Truffaut already did it better. "},{"Title":"Critics are who?

However, it's not being billed as a comedy by the studio.First of all, you have to buy into the fact that a man who looks like Antonio Banderas needs a mail-order bride. Then, you have to believe that the woman who responds to such an advertisement in turn looks like Angelina Jolie.  Original Sin is based upon Cornell Woolrich's (Rear Window) novel, Waltz Into Darkness, which Francois Truffaut adapted in 1969 and titled Mississippi Mermaid. It starred Jean-Paul Belmondo as a tobacco planter whose mail-order bride, played by Catherine Deneuve, turns out to be an impostor. This time around, the steamy story is adapted and directed by Michael Cristofer, who helped poise Jolie for stardom in the HBO-flick, Gia.In Original Sin, Banderas (Spy Kids) is Luis Vargas, a 19th century Cuban coffee mogul, and Jolie (Tomb Raider) is Julia Russell, a young American who wants to make a change in her life. She steps off the boat, pouting and vamping, and affecting a Madonnaesque English accent for no apparent reason. Just hours later, the couple are wed. Extreme close-ups on naked bodies, smoldering brown eyes, massive lips, and arty post-coital contortions follow (I was looking for the game of Twister under the sheets, but didn't see those telltale colored dots). Before long, the bride not only steals his heart, she cleans out the joint bank account and disappears (pouting and vamping as she goes). Luis begins to suspect that perhaps his bride isn't who he thought she was after all. American PI Walter Downs (Thomas Jane, Deep Blue Sea) shows up to investigate at the behest of the real Julia's sister, Emily. Luis decides that, since he can't live without his conniving wife, he wants to be the one to kill her. So he hires Downs, too (even though he only has $11 left in his bank account). But instead of killing her, he ends up killing *for* her. (When Banderas says, with an admirably straight face, I have killed for her. And I would do it again, I felt like raising my hand, Me, me! Pick me!)The dialogue is so corny, I kept looking for a Niblets product placement. I think I got Jello instead, when one of Julia's would-be suitors, standing outside her bedroom door as she undresses, declares, My heart is pudding. I will go, but my pudding is all broken! Of course, this screenplay *does* come from the same man who wrote this dialogue for Gia I do be da pittiest pittiest girl, I do be dat.The cinematography is under-lit and as one-dimensional as the screen, at times blending the actors' heads into the dark backgrounds. Not only do the actors fade into the woodwork (maybe they were *trying* to), Jolie actually looks flat-chested. That's a mean feat. In addition, Banderas's pores were bigger than life and the bulging veins in Jolie's hands, arms and forehead were so blue, I checked my press kit to see if the makeup was by Stan Winston. The loud, irritating soundtrack is upstaged only by some of the oddest editing I have ever seen, jam-packed with jump-cuts, step-zooms, blurry pans, incongruous dolly shots, and floating crane perspectives. The only wannabe arty shot I *didn't* see was kitchen-sink.Prior to seeing Original Sin (which was supposed to come out in November of last year, then February... for some reason, can't imagine why, this film's release was repeatedly delayed), I read that Jolie's brother, James Haven, would be appearing onscreen. I looked and looked, then concluded that unless he was  Banderas's body-double for the love scenes, he wasn't in it. I waited for the end credits and saw that he played a masked character in the stage-play scene. He probably took one look at the dailies and volunteered for that role. He's smarter than I thought.But kudos have to go to Jolie and Banderas -- who allow themselves to have their mouths spat into and be mano-a-mano soul-kissed, respectively -- for fully immersing themselves in this tawdry tete-a-tete and for playing their roles to their fullest folly (while pouting and vamping, of course).I don't know if Original Sin will become a contemporary camp classic like Showgirls, but there is nothing original in it and the only sin is, this movie was finally released. At any rate, if you decide to shell out your hard-earned dough, you will certainly keep watching to see what outright outrageousness will be thrust upon you next. The original sin was murder -- and so is this movie!

Of coarse that doesn't mean it wasn't entertaining, I was most definitely entertained-hence the 6 rating. Original Sin is a movie that should have come out in the eighties, it's got a kind of lush, glamorous, larger then life, feel to it and since the eighties were full of these type of movies, it feels more suited to that time period. I actually moderately enjoyed this movie at times, though, at other times I wanted to go to sleep. It probably should have been a bit shorter.Original Sin stars two of the best looking movie stars in the world-Antonio Banderus and Angelina Jolie. Yet strangely, their chemistry together was not strong. Not to me anyway. They were almost to good looking, their looks detracted from the storyline, instead of seeing a female con artist and her hapless husband, at times I saw-two larger then life, gorgeous Hollywood movie stars. And it REALLY didn't help that the Banderus character was given so little to do. Except follow Jolie around that is. Banderus is an incredibly talented actor and his character should have been a bit more multi dimensional, this role didn't play to his strengths. The general acting however was fine by all. It was the way the story progressed that I had trouble with.Firstly, all of the plot twists were dizzying and rather then being edge of your seat exciting it was, at times, a bit to melodramatic. I like psychological thrillers where the suspense seems natural and not force fed and it didn't here. You always know your watching a movie although the sumptuous visuals and just the general sultry, balmy quality of the movie keep you moderately involved all the same which is why I still gave it a 6. It wasn't BAD at all, just over the top and took itself way to seriously. I liked the premise, love psychological thrillers and like and admire the performers featured in this. I just thought the movie seemed to be playing more for outrageousness then for slow tension building excitement which it really didn't have so much. And there is such a thing as a movie having to many twists and turns.I was however interested in seeing how it all played out and it did get way more interesting toward the end(the romance starts to gain in intensity and intrigue) and I could see even watching it again if I'm in a certain mood as it's one of those guilty pleasure type movies.

The title of this should have actually been Original Sin(s), as it achieves just about all of them at least twice and in a short period of time. I am reminded by the old adage of messing with a snake and getting bit in this film. Or playing with dirt and getting dirty. In either case, good people fall victim to bad over some misguided concept of love. The harlot gets her knight-in-shining-armor and the knight succumbs to a succubus' poison apple. In the end, nobody really wins anything. But what you do get is Antonio Banderas and Angelina Jolie in some steamy scenes together after arranging a blind date marriage. The film is set back a bit, I would say in the 1800s, with Antonio as a wealthy coffee merchant and Angelina acting to be someone else, who's acting to be someone else (where the deceit comes in obviously). Antonio's foreign wife turns out to be anything but what he expected in more ways than one.

Nothing works, none of the setting has any artistic emotion or esthetic value. Acting is bad, with the exception of Banderas who gives a fine performance despite everything around.

Banderas plays Luis, who falls instantly and madly (and stupidly) in love with her upon picking her up from her journey. They have steamy sex with lots of gratuitous nudity and then the story begins.  Julia skips town with a bunch of Luis' cash and for the rest of the film, Luis follows her around like a love sick lap dog begging her to take him back and abuse him some more.   The plot twists and turns, but the `surprises' are so obvious that they may as well have put up road signs saying, `WATCH OUT, PLOT TWIST AHEAD.' The dialogue is banal and mindless and the characters are transparent and simplistic.  The viewer comes away without being able to identify with either character.  Luis is so pathetic that we can feel only disgust and lack of respect for all his groveling, and Julia is so callous and wicked that no amount of attractiveness can overcome the revulsion she elicits.This film is a dreadful waste of talent.

That version is a devastating study of obsessive love, of a woman who cannot help being duplicitous and almost evil, and of a man who risks everything, including breaking the law, because he loves her.This version is, unsurprisingly, not really as good. For a start, Antonio Banderas and especially Angelina Jolie she tries but is just not good enough of an actress to carry of the part that well are poor subtitutes for John Paul Belmondo and Catherine Deneuve. The framing device in this version just does not come off, and despite the stronger sexual content which is nothing to shout about,the original was oddly more erotic. Worse of all, this one tries to become a conventional audience pleaser with some action and violence towards the end, which is reasonably well done but no match for the subtle power of the French film's end scenes. Using salsa when more conventional scoring would have increased the tension does not work either.Still, Original Sin is an OK film. It has a good story which has not really been changed too much, and although leisurely paced it certainly holds the attention, if only to see how low Banderas' character will sink next. Ultimately, it's a love story, and despite it's dark elements, like all good love stories, it's quite moving.

(Except perhaps - and this is just a minor nit-pick - use those dopey jump cuts.) It's a good deal fresher than your average erotic thriller; the characters feel as though they have been conceived from scratch rather than copied from something else, and the same can be said for the overall mood. The nudity is NOT gratuitous in a bad sense. Bad gratuitous nudity is there to please the director during filming or perhaps the studio accountants; good gratuitous nudity is there to please the audience. (Angelina Jolie certainly pleased me.) Besides, I can't see it working as well WITHOUT the nudity; this is a tropical location, after all, and the directors use of human flesh suggests caressing heat and mild indolence and distance from the centres of the civilisations from which these people original came (America and Spain) rather well.Perhaps the pace is too CONSISTENTLY brisk.
