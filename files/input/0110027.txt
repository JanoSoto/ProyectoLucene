[{"Title":"Mildly entertaining - An improvement over II","Date":"4 December 2005","Score":"24 out of 28 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Fantasy, Romance","Review":" Just to be up-front about this - I enjoy these films. The original - Highlander - was the only one in the series which really stands the test of time (Endgame has now joined it in this), and stands head and shoulders above the others for artistic merit and originality, but still, I liked the others well enough. I also like the much maligned Christopher Lambert. He's an odd actor to be sure - far from the Hollywood norm in appearance, style and accent, but he's nothing if not original and once you understand his understated style, you might just see that the guy has some serious talent. Read on if these statements resonate with you. Otherwise, feel free to move on without reading or rating this review.Lambert is good, Unger is good, Van Peebles is campy as hell, alternating between absurdist humor and menacing poseur-ship.The script is OK, certainly less grandiose and more mindless than II (and closer to the original in feeling, pace and plot), but not particularly original.The production values are a slight step up from II, about as good as Endgame, and almost up to the original's standards.Conor McLeod has reclaimed something of his humanity - imagining himself to be the last immortal on earth, but of course, he is wrong. Sorcerer Kane, who has stolen the magic of one of McLeod's former teachers, is hunting his head. McLeod has adopted a child and is about to fall in love again, the last thing he needs is an attack by an enemy who has no corporeal body.The film is entirely predictable, and is nothing more than a fan film. So what? It's harmless entertainment with some very pretty scenes from Scotland and some other gorgeous landscapes, and, if you don't expect much, you might just have a good time with it.

This time, it's Highlander III The Sorcerer or, as it was known in the U.S., Highlander The Final Dimension. (Don't ask me where the hell that came from) The film finds Connor MacLeod (Christopher Lambert) enjoying a peaceful life with his adopted son, deceived that he has won the Prize. However, the evil sorcerer Kane (Mario Van Peebles) has broken free from the Japanese mountain he was entombed in, and now he wants the Highlander's head.One of the parts of the film I enjoyed the most was Christopher Lambert's portrayal of Connor. For once the character isn't a severely depressed maniac, and in fact, he's better in this film than any other. Mario Van Peebles makes a good, if not unbelievable villain, with Deborah Unger as the sexy Highlander girl.Andy Morahan's direction is good. The script is good and very entertaining, but the film's problem is this although it has all the right materials to make a good film, they are either wasted, put in the wrong place or dropped quickly. It makes you wonder if the franchise is cursed.The film's score, by J. Peter Robinson, was very nice as well. Loreena McKennit's Bonny Portmore, featured twice in the film, is a beautiful and outstanding song that has now become the theme for the series.All in all, while Highlander III (Sorcerer/Final Dimension) is an entertaining film, it can't come anywhere near comparing to the original film, although it is a major improvement over Highlander II.

With respect to the first Highlander this film actually follows it pretty well.  It's funny though because it totally disregards the existence of Highlander 2.  In Highlander 2 they show Brenda Wyatt (the main girl in the first Highlander film) dying from the effects of a depleted ozone layer, but in this film they mention that she was killed in a car accident.  Anyhow, if you pretend that Highlander 2 doesn't exist, this actually makes a good deal of sense with regard to the original Highlander.  The only qualm I have with the film is how could Connor MacLeod think he has the prize when there are still 3 more immortals out there?  That doesn't really seem to make sense, but maybe some die-hard Highlander fan can explain it to me.Anyhow, all in all, I thought this was a really good film.  I loved all the actors, Christopher Lambert does a great job as Connor MacLeod as always and I was really impressed with Mario Van Peebles, he did a fantastic job, and looked really menacing throughout the film.  Deborah Unger was a nice addition, she's definitely a looker, and not a bad actor either.The story was pretty good, but it's nothing terribly complicated.  The special effects are very nicely done.I'm not a die-hard Highlander fan, but I do like the films, and I thought this film was great.  I hope you enjoy the film as well.

Debra Unger is also a plus as a smokin' leading lady who provides the best and sweatiest sex scene of the Highlander cycle. There are also some great locales used in the film. From snowy Japan to African deserts to the Scottish Highlands, the film features all three beautifully.

The suspended animation thing is a lame way to bring up a new enemy but at least it doesn't explain that they are from a different planet, or completely contradict the original like the fourth.

Davis decided to try again and make the true sequel to Highlander meaning Highlander III The Sorcerer would have to disregard Highlander II The Quickening, a movie which could be considered a stand alone film since it's plot completely changes the Highlander mythology.Highlander III The Sorcerer does have some flaws, the main flaw is that this movie tries to hard to mimic the style of the original but lacks the punch that made the first film such a cult classic. A prime example is the main villain Kain, he seems like a rehashed version of the Kurgen. Mario Van Peebles is a great actor and does a good attempt at copying the Kurgan but sadly he can't match Clancy Brown's performance.Another example is the car scene where Kane tries to scare the kid by playing chicken with planes. It's just a copy of the scene in the original Highlander except changed slightly.The chemistry between Connor and Ramirez was one of the things that made Highlander so memorable. It was like a father and son relationship, sadly the chemistry between Connor and Nakano isn't the same. Mako does a great performance but sadly the film doesn't give him enough screen time, if the film delved deeper with the mentor training Connor it might of had the same power the original had.The flashback scenes are pulled off well giving the movie more depth.The training scene in Scottland is beautifully shot and the song Bonny Portmore definitely makes it more powerful. The sword fights are choreographed well and move at a good pace.The special effects are okay.The plot of Highlander III sees Connor MacLeod living with his adopted son John in Marakesh until an evil Immortal named Kane is released. Centuries ago Connor was training with a sorcerer named Nakano, Kain and his two henchmen stormed his hideout searching for Macleod. Nakano fought back but was killed by Kane, while absorbing the Quickening the cave collapsed. When Kane beheads one of his henchmen Connor senses it, so he decides to leave Marakesh and return to New York. The game is back on and the prize is at stake once againHighlander III The Sorcerer lacks the charm of the original but despite it's flaws Highlander III is a watchable sequel.

I recently rewatched the first Highlander, and saw the two sequels for the first time and came to the conclusion that yes, there should really only have been one.The core concept behind Highlander is a good one immortal warriors fighting over centuries until only one is left, who will win the Prize, the nature of which varies over the various entries of the franchise, but is usually described as the power of all immortals who ever lived. The only way an Immortal can be killed is by removal of the head, usually via sword.This made for a good film an epic story spanning hundreds of years, cool swordfights and a good performance from Christopher Lambert made the original Highlander one of the better 1980s films out there. At the end of the film, he had supposedly won the Prize, and that was that.However, because it was so successful, it spawned sequels the hilariously bad Highlander II, and the one being reviewed, Highlander III The Sorcerer.The film starts with Connor MacLoed (Christopher Lambert) going to Japan a couple of hundred years ago to learn from the sorcerer Nakano who has the handy ability to make illusions appear from thin air. Nakano is also being hunted by Kane(Mario van Peebles), a villain who is virtually a carbon copy of the Kurgan (is a barbarian, likes to kill women and children, etc) who wants the power of illusion to do bad things. Kane catches up with Nakano, Connor escapes and Kane is buried in Nakano's cave.Skip forward a few hundred years Connor is living with his adopted son in some Middle Eastern country, until Kane is released from a cave by an archaeologist obsessed with ancient Japan (a variant on the love interest from the first film). Connor becomes aware that Kane is back, and then goes back to New York to kill Kane. Apparently he didn't win the Prize after all, and is in actual fact an Immortal who thinks he is mortal (which he was meant to become at the end of the first film). What follows is pretty much a retelling of the first film. There are two scenes that are really blatant copies of ones from the first film Kane taunts Connor on holy ground where Immortals cannot fight. The first time he does this they fight and they actually explain what happens when you do fight on holy ground, and the second time is virtually the same as the scene with the Kurgan in the church in the first film.The second time you get a sense of deja vu is when Kane kidnaps Connor's son, and then proceeds to drive around terrifying him by playing chicken with various vehicles. The exact same scene was in the first film, when the Kurgan kidnaps Connor's love interest and speeds through New York. However, any sense of danger in the scene in the third film is removed by the fact that all of the things Kane pretends to collide with are illusions, which cannot actually harm the occupants of the car.Connor and Kane fight, Connor kills Kane, and then wins the Prize again, at least until the next sequel Highlander Endgame, which at least was trying to do something new. And even the effects of Connor's quickening (the process by which Immortals take the power of those they have killed) were just lifted from the first film and cleaned up a bit. It's just plain lazy film-making.Mario van Peebles makes for a rather camp and unthreatening villain as Kane, who you never believe Connor will have any difficulty in defeating. He does try in some places make his performance different from that of the Kurgan, but the script demands he attempts to mimic the first film's villain.Christopher Lambert just seems rather bored throughout the film, which isn't surprising as he contemplated walking off of Highlander II (which he made through gritted teeth). He probably only agreed to appear in this due to getting a rise and the prospect of some easy money. The other actors are rather forgettable.I sometimes persevere with a bad film if it makes me laugh. Highlander III did manage this, but only in a few bits. Most of the time it just bored me, and the only reason I didn't put it off was so I wouldn't ever want to waste more time watching it at a later date. It isn't really worth bothering with as such - the first film or Highlander Endgame are better choices. Of course, if you have the boxset, then you already have it, so I'd advise you watch one of the other three films. They are all better than this tired cash-in.

Well the movies in my opinion were never as good a the TV show, with the fist movie being the only redeeming one of the bunch. Part 3 is a pretty bad movie and my opinion has not changed since I first saw it ten years ago. Some on this board say its a remake of the first others say it continues from the first. Either way the movie is awful. The movie starts out way back when Connor Macleod (Lambert) leaves Scotland and sets out for his quest, I suppose. Eventually makes his way to Japan, where of course he comes across the master sorcerer Nakano (Mako). There he learns the way of the sword and how to fight. Ever seen Conan? Well so did the people who wrote this. While he becomes a better swordsman, evil is approaching. Kane (Mario Van Peebles), what an original name for evil, and along the way he shows how evil he is by burning down a small village in the dead of winter. Did I mention the movie Conan? Kane makes his way to Nakano's cave and beheads him taking his magic for himself, but becomes trapped in the cave until the movie is made. While Macleod has been trying to forget his past, a female archaeologist Alex Johnson (Unger) has managed to uncover the cave of the Wizard Nakano. As you guessed Kane is released and promptly beheads one of his thugs and sends the other after Macleod. Macleod senses something is up, returns to New York where we have a badly acted cop attempting to get him for previous murders. He mostly fails and Alex tracks him down using a piece of tartan found in the cave that revels who he is. Kane also finds him and of course they duel. Macleod loses and runs back to Scotland for no real reason. There he finds time to make a new sword and have sex with Alex, the hot female lead. You have just witnessed the best part of the movie so don't worry about the end, but I'll tell you anyway. Macleod once again confronts him and defeats him in a very anti climatic ending. There can be only one.Defiantly not the worst movie I have ever seen, but this is certainly worthy of mention. As stated in my title, the only real reason to watch this movie is for the very well done directors cut sex scene. Deborah Unger is no joke! She is not only hot but certainly knows how to handle Lambert. I guess I'm not surprised that it had to be in the directors cut with what they show. By far the only entertaining part of this film. From the fight scenes to the special effects there just isn't much great about this movie. The acting is terrible. I'm not sure who is worse Lambert who can't act at all or Van Peebles who looks like a total moron in the film and acts like a idiot. Is there any point to Kane driving like a maniac with Macleod's kid in the car? What a waste of time and film. Unger at least is hot and who cares if she acts bad. The special effects were OK. For the time I would say they were maybe average. The story was also poor. Mako is wasted as the oriental master and could have been much better. Scene after scene was just boring and a waste. As mentioned the car scene, also many flashbacks, some were OK. Kane going to a hooker and putting a condom in his mouth, pretty stupid. How about Lambert getting shot and jacked in the streets then taken to hospital and thrown in the mental ward. Stupid. Keep an eye out for Kane's sword Dark Magic witch is a finely crafted sword. The on locations of Scotland and other places are good, but I didn't come for geography I want a good movie. Overall a very poor movie that actually spawned more sequels. If you want the best sex scene in a non porn film, this is it, if not watch the superior TV series with Adrian Paul. 3 out of 10...There can be only one!

It feels like a movie made by people who have seen other stories and can copy elements of stories, but don't have a clue how to TELL a story themselves. On three separate occasions random phone calls are used to propel the story forward. Characters suddenly inexplicable phone the character on-screen and rapidly provide them with just the right information to propel the story forward. This sort of thing is hilariously bad. But also frustrating because the viewer can plainly see other (subtle) ways the story could/should have been driven in that particular direction. Phone calls aside, the film is full of clunky moments like that. Something randomly happens because, basically, the script needs to get a character from A to B. Some of these instances (like when Connor is declared a lunatic&#x85; a lunatic&#x85; a lunatic) are so abrupt and so badly done they are laugh-out-loud funny.On the topic of things that are badly done in this film a lot of the dialogue is dubbed. And the dubbing is obvious and badly. The scenes with the New York Cop character could actually be scenes from a full-on foreign language film.The film opens with classic examples of tell-don't-show storytelling. We can forgive the lead character's opening narration to camera as he is basically recapping the events of the first film, but the Nakano character opens the movie by warning MacLeod that someone evil is coming to kill them. And that's it. He tells the hero/us that Kane is evil and then Kane appears. And, thanks to a wildly OTT performance from Mario Van Peebles, Kane spends the entire movie as a one-note villain. Relentlessly evil. And certainly no fun to watch.The pace is good, however. Something is always happening, and the locations/flashbacks keep things fresh for the entire running time. It all feels like a missed opportunity. The same cast and story with a good script would have made for a decent entry in the series. After all, the excellent TV series proved that it is more than possible to tell good/great stories using this formula.4/10 "},{"Title":"I Kinda like it","Date":"19 September 2013","Score":"","Genre":"Action, Fantasy, Romance","Review":" What can you say about the highlander sequels.

They didn't.Highlander 2 had WAY too many weaknesses. Setting Highlander in the future is really stupid and that movie said that they were from another planet. The director of THAT film saw the mess and tried to make a directors cut saying that Connor and Ramirez were exiles from the past which made me cringe even more.Then we have this. I will start with the compliments. The music is rather well scored and the fight sequences are - as usual - worth a watch and Christopher Lambert does the role of Connor justice as he does in the other 2 (he just needed a better script for the second one).Now the complaints. They introduce Sorcery in this film which destroys the first one because the premise of that universe is Everything's normal except we have these immortals running around trying to cut off their head. They introduce a villain who has a deep voice and is like The Kurgan in the fact that he wants the prize that MacLeod apparently didn't get at the end of the first (???).The love interest happens to look like a girl that Connor bedded in the 1800's which destroys the character, Heather was his only love and when she died we are supposed to believe that Connor shut himself out from anyone else until Brenda Wyatt in 1986 New York. On that note where the hell was she in this? No information as to where she went, no John, Take care of your mother.Overall this is a better sequel than The Quickening but its still crap.

CONNOR MACLEOD (The returning CHRISTOPHER LAMBERT) is there when Kane kills Nakano & manages to escape with his head still attached, by trapping Kane & his henchmen alive behind a wall of debris. 400 years later, Kane & his two cohorts are released after archaeologist ALEX JOHNSON & her colleagues do some digging in the area. CONNOR has been living in peace in Makesh, with his adopted son when he is called back to New York to engage in a feud with his old enemy & fight for the prize yet again.The best thing that can be said about HIGHLANDER III is that, it's not HIGHLANDER 2, at least this film plays coherently. Even CHRISTOPHER LAMBERT has stated in interviews that this is the true & real sequel to the first film. It's the only film in the series who's story makes for a serviceable sequel to the first, without contradicting the original's plot. It far surpasses HIGHLANDER 2 THE QUICKENING (RENEGADE VERSION) in that it makes more sense than that one did. Speaking of HIGHLANDER 2, HIGHLANDER III ignores it out right completely, this is confirmed when Connor's wife Brenda (the heroine in the original) is said to have been killed instantly in Scotland, when in the second she had died of Melanoma. Director ANDY MORHAN (another music video director) manages to deliver a very slick & polished look to the film, dazzling the viewer with several cool shots, much like HIGHLANDER 1 & 2 helmer Russell Mulcahy did with the first & fell flat on in the second. The acting is relatively good as well & the SONG OF THE POOKA is such a beautiful piece of music & really fits the film well. On the downside though, I do admit to having a few problems with this one. I think one of my main beefs with the film, is how Kane is to reminiscent of Kurgan seen in the original, even down to his dry scratchy voice, in fact he comes off almost as a complete carbon copy of the character, only he's not as fun & Van Peebles plays the role far to over the top & the film still doesn't answer questions fans of the series might have like, How did the prize & the quickening come to be? Why are some people born immortal? Why is the Church considered holy ground to them? How come they can only be killed by decapitation? another problem I had was the fact that Connor thought the prize was won at the end of the first film & yet he never once questions why he cannot influence the minds of world leaders for good? surely he would know something was wrong here? There's also one silly scene where Connor arrives in New York & is instantly gunned down by gang members, he is found & taken to the local hospital, where he is then committed to a psychiatric wing of the hospital, because he was covered in his own blood & and said he was shot & yet no wounds are found & I wish DEBORAH KARA UNGER had more to do here & that the film-makers would have integrated her character better than what they did. I just wasn't feeling the love story developing between her & Connor, especially since they don't really meet until the fifty minute mark. Perhaps HIGHLANDER III's only other falling, apart from the Kurgan like villain is how the films plot comes off as a cheaper version of the first films, Deborah Unger's character following Connor Macleod around & watches as he & another immortal fight one another, her discovery of who he is & his powers & develops a relationship with him, a cop trailing Connor believing he is committing a string of heinous murders, Kane playing chicken in a moving car with a terrified victim, using illusions to terrify him even further, various lines of dialogue is repeated from the first, Connor impaled with a sword & falling to the ground (in a redo of the 16th century flashback battle scene from the original) Heather's final request to Connor to light a candle & visit her on her birthday can be heard as Connor visits her grave & it's never answered as to why Kane would wait 400 years until he was free in order to kill both his cohorts, why keep them alive all this time? All in all while it does rely on the original films plot maybe a little to much, HIGHLANDER III THE SORCERER (The title I saw it under) is a relatively entertaining film, it's nowhere near as good as the first, but it definitely makes up for the incoherent mess HIGHLANDER 2 was, at least this film stuck to the original mythos, instead of making the immortals aliens from a far off planet. Fans of the first will find much to love here, but if you never cared for the first two, than don't bother with this one. a.k.a. HIGHLANDER III THE FINAL DIMENSION & HIGHLANDER III THE MAGICIAN.

Since it doesn't really do anything except show a couple of pictures of movies you might like If you enjoyed this movie, I was surprised that it didn't list any of the other Highlander films! This is interesting, because as I see it, this film is more of a tribute/remake of the first 'Highlander' (regarded as the best of the series by most fans of the genre).While some have commented that this was better than Highlander 2, I whole-heartedly disagree. At least HL 2 was somewhat original...The first strike against HL3 (aka The Final Dimension) is that Sean Connery ('Juan Ramirez' in the first two installments) sat out this time. The second is that 'Queen' didn't do any of the music in it (though Loreena McKennit's stirring Bonny Portmore appears, which was to become a staple of the series. Incidentally, another version by Laura Creamer appears later in 'Endgame').Now the comparisons, since it basically creates for itself an inevitable comparison to the first film, while it does make a weak attempt to paint itself as a sequel (claiming that some Immortals survived the first Gathering mysteriously and appear in 1994 to start it all anew).IMHO, Mario Van Peebles is not as good a villain as Clancy Brown. His Kane character is crazy and evil, but he seems more like a guy who dressed up in leather doing an impression of the Kurgan than a unique bad guy who really needs to be feared. While the idea of having Kane control the power of illusion is novel for the series, the special effects don't add much to his character. Perhaps this is fitting, since Kane doesn't earn his powers, but steals them from another Immortal.Macleod looks older and tireder in this version, but he still manages to pull off his character well, despite the rehashed nature of this film.In all, this movie has some nice special effects, and the sword battles are spectacular, some of the best yet seen in a 'Highlander' flick, especially the final battle. The final quickening, though very cool is nothing compared to the one in the first film. The movie is also a bit shorter, with a running time of 99 minutes it was the shortest yet (Endgame is actually the shortest, at 86+ minutes, but that director's cut purports to be 101 minutes long).Also, continuity-wise, much of the prior story is brushed aside (much like Alien3) only worse, as it contradicts Highlander 2 which was made before (and not to mention Endgame which came later).I would rank the films in order of most entertaining and best overall as follows (each would be the director's cut of course, as the producers/directors of the HL franchise seem to have a habit of shafting their fans at the theatre then winning them back on video)Highlander (best) Highlander II Renegade Highlander Endgame Highlander III (least)And you can arguably fit the series in there just below the first film or the second. In short, if you've never seen a HL flick before, skip this one and go for the original. If you are looking to complete your collection, go with the DVD release (unlike the VHS version, it's in widescreen and includes a trailer that has a line of dialogue not in the final cut of the movie).As a mindless action flick, this one is watchable.A note, the Director's Cut is the only version I've seen. From what I've read it basically adds a few more sex scenes and a bit more gore, that's about it. If HL 1 was a 10, and 2 an 8, this would be a 6.

Highlander, released in 1985, has spawned both two popular syndicated television series and an stupid animated series, so it's surprising that the franchise's own worst enemy is the pair of film sequel it has been produced 5 years later Highlander II The Quickening, made in 1990, one of the worst movies ever made. After the great failure of this film, the Davis/Panzer teaming decide to make up with making this film. So, we have Highlander The Final Dimension, made in 1994, starring the original Highlander, Christopher Lambert. It's a great pleasure on the big screen, having Christopher Lambert as Connor MacLeod, the role that he created and later inspired the HighlanderThe Series producers in 1992, though he seemed elevated to competence in the first film through proximity to fellow Immortal Sean Connery (alas, Juan Sunchez Villa-Lobos Ramirez's character remains dead and Connery remains smart enough to avoid non-Bond sequels). Even excusing the implausible French-Scots accent, Lambert's performance as Connor MacLeod (in HL1 and HL3 and the HLTS 1st episode) was always one of the greatest and hightest points of the Immortal Universe, making him probably THE coolest Immortal in the Highlander Film-Series. And, to be truthfull and onnest, if Connor MacLeod didn't exist, then Duncan and the characters of the televison series would have not been existed. The nastiest of these in this installment is Kane (Mario Van Peebles), a 751 years old Immortal, who was trupped in a cave at Japan for 400 years, while he gained the power of the Sorcerer Nakano, Connor's second teacher. The Final Dimension is all over the map and timeline It starts in late 16th-century Japan and includes scenes from revolutionary France, 18th-century Scotland and 20th-century Morocco and New York City. This is movement, but it's hardly action. For that, one turns to the four sword fights that shape the film (immortals shun modern weaponry), with most interests the one in the Budish shrine (a little bit ridiculous, since the Budish Shrine was a Holly Ground, but, as it seems, Kane was VERY bad and unreligious) and the Final Battle in the end (certainly better than the Final Battle in the first one). There are also scenes of sword forgings and sword training (in Japan with the ubiquitous and truly Immortal Japanese actor Mako -one of the classiest and greatest Japanese actors). There's even a set piece with Lambert running through the Scottish Highlands, slashing the air as Loreena McKennitt sings a beautifull ballad that aims to follow in the chart steps of the original's Who Wants to Live Forever?, and comes very close.MacLeod's love interest this time around is archaeologist Alex Johnson (Deborah Unger, also playing his 18th-century paramour, Sarah Berrington), but other than her showing up for unusual scene segues, nothing much happens. As for Van Peebles, he's a big improvement to General Katana's character at HL2, but unfortunately, he's reapiting much of Clancy Brown's the Kurgan character (and lines), making his character a litle boring, but still, he's a good villain.The Final Dimension marks the feature debut of video veteran Andy Morahan, here following in the footsteps of video director Russell Mulcahy (who did the first and second films). Many people said that he should have stayed in the Music video productions, but I believe he made a good film, with style and inspiration.Given that each movie has had its good and bad points, I'm not sure whether this is worthy of praise or not. I think Highlander The Final Dimension is one of the better sequels in the Highlander series, although many people thought that it had been failed as a true Highlander sequel.

We find MacLeod living with his adoptive son in Morocco and satisfied that he is the last immortal and has the coveted Prize. Soon he receives a cognition that more immortals are alive (revived from death by an archaeological dig) and packs for NYC for a duel with the evil sorcerer immortal Kane.Made while the TV show was at its peak, this film benefits from the influence of its narrative and production style that had been refined over the years. Most of the characters and their relationships (especially the love interests) are thin and underdeveloped. The movie relies heavily on nostalgia for the 1st film for the impact of its emotional scenes. It also mirrors it's story to the point of being a near remake. The police hunt subplot simply drops out of the picture near the end and the villains are too silly to be threatening. The special f/x are enjoyable but underused (Kane barely uses his illusions during fights.) Still, the deja vu, and pretension and trickery themes are well handled (though not explored as much as they could have been). Lambert is as appropriately melancholy and good humored as in previous entries but seems uninspired and even tired of the role, van Peeples is clearly having fun with his deliciously devilish over the top performance exploiting every villainous cliché in the book, Unger is quite attractive (even more so in the obligatory sex scene, of course), and Mako's dignified presence is, of course, a welcome addition to the Highlander saga. The special f/x were good for its time and are still fairly impressive today.Overall, a competent production and a mildly entertaining, if rehashed, film with some interesting ideas that were not fully realized.

Shortly after MacCleod's 'reawakening' and within moments after arriving in New York, he is greeted by a carful of thugs which conveniently show up and shoot him--a wonderful advertisement for why we should not want to visit New York--if all tourists and guests to this fine city would be greeted in the same horrific manner.Directors and producers let sleeping dogs lay. Don't awaken a sleeping giant that is much more of a Godzilla than a Lord of the Rings. Stop trying so hard to get the Oscar, and just stick to the basics of good film making.

This film sees the series stretched out to nobodies benefit.  The film tries to simply do what the first one did.

Van Peebles is as poor as I'm used to seeing him be.  He plays his character with all the real menace and character of a poor WWF wrestler.  He is simply repeating the character than Clancy Jones played some time ago.

Highlander 1 and 2 had Sean Connery teaching Lambert, and his character was great. The Gathering had Lambert himself teaching a new guy, Adrian Paul.

He's a decent actor, but the character doesn't hold a candle to Connery or Lambert, and in a film about mentors and their students, he should have.Beautiful Scottish footage (in the film's best scenes) and well-choreographed sword-fights can't save this from being disappointing. ** out of *****.

For one, the awfulness that was Highlander 2 The Quickening was still too fresh in one's mind. Secondly, there was no trace of Sean Connery (not that his presence saved The Quickening, it merely alleviated). And thirdly, despite studying the cinema magazines (this was a time before IMDb, mind you) and being relatively up-to-date, I had not even heard about a third part being in production.The first reaction as the movie began at least the tedious science-fiction storyline of Quickening was ignored, making this a prequel but despite ignoring Quickening, Quickening had one advantage to Sorcerer it was real cinema while The Sorcerer reeks of television production, being shot on TV-sets that look like they were leftovers from a McQuade-episode.An action-franchise, be it Highlander or James Bond lives and dies through the villain and hence Mario Van Peebles, as villainous immortal Kane, is one of the film's biggest letdowns Van Peebles mimics the original villain Kurgan one-to-one but where Clancy Brown came across as threatening and psychotic, Van Peebles grimacing and growling reminds us more of a Halloween-bogeyman, dressed up like Genghis Khan. Granted, all major villains of the Highlander-sequels have essentially been carbon-copies of The Kurgan but Van Peebles hams it up so badly, it's almost embarrassing. Even for Highlander-fans.It's a kind of magic, was not only one of the catchphrases of the original, it was part of the concept and partial reason to it's success what made those warriors immortal, why they had to fight and what the fabled prize would be, was pretty much left out or only hinted at in the original film. What killed the magic in Highlander 2 was the attempt to explain the background and reasons &#x96; something the fan didn't actually want to have explained; what's killing the magic in Highlander 3 is the actual depiction and use of magic. Perhaps the producers didn't realize it but the Highlander-fans didn't want magical gimmicks or sorcerers &#x96; they wanted immortal warriors who fought each other for reasons not known or understood.One was glad when *spoiler ahead* the evil Kane was finally beheaded &#x96; not so much because Connor McLeod prevailed (again) *spoiler end* but because the movie was finally over and that there would be no more sequels, like Highlander The Series, Highlander Endgame or Highlander 5 The Source, which one would inadvertently have to watch.

This epidemic was previously seen in Highlander The Series, but not to this degree. Actual lines of dialog and specific scenes are remade, as well. Expect a ripoff of Clancy Brown's performance from Peebles. It may work better for fans of the TV series who are unfamiliar with the original.The stylistic direction is competent, but the work done by Russell Mulcahy in the first two movies is far superior. In fact, that is what really hurts the film it has all been done better. The music is second-rate compared to Queen's score for the first movie, featuring forgettable rock songs. The one highlight of the score is Bonny Portmore, which gives the Scotland scenes an almost tragic feel. It would work well as an addition to the Queen songs, but it cannot carry the film itself. Also, there is a hilariously bad rendition of Motley Crue's Dr. Feelgood in the film. To be honest, it is actually a rip-off instrumental version with a few notes changed for the sake of not having to buy the rights.The upside of the movie is Lambert, who actually seems better at playing Connor MacLeod than he was in the first film. Deborah Unger does a competent job with her role, but is really just there as a replacement for Roxanne Hart.Been there, done that, you say? Then do not bother.

There SHOULD have been only one &#150; one *Highlander* film, that is.

Each successive sequel has been exactly the opposite.Regarding *The Sorcerer* (aka *The Final Dimension*), it is quite pointless reviewing or in any way even describing the plots of movies which do not adhere to their own internal logic. In this case (barring the first exceptional installment), this whole series has been battling against itself, in reneging on its own oft-repeated slogan There can be only one. Well, obviously NOT...The disjointed characters move through *The Sorcerer*'s listless plot with no regard to continuity or semblance of purpose &#150; they just end up where they need to be for a scene to play itself out &#150; all those scenes which were obviously pitching points for the producers to lay on the money-men. Now, how to join those scenes? It mattered not, as long as the money was green and the picture was greenlighted.Also directed by a former music-video director, Andy Morahan, *The Sorcerer* displays none of the art and eye that Mulcahy brought to *Highlander*, though Morahan has no qualms in plagiarizing Mulcahy's film at every turn, inserting flashback scenes to gird the storyline and attempt poignancy, copying scenes (such as the villain Kane's pale impression of The Kurgan, when he mocks MacLeod's son in the car) and just blatantly *repeating* scenes from *Highlander*.The movie's early sequences display more than enough chinks in its feeble armor, where we catch up with MacLeod sometime after *Highlander*, but before *Highlander II The Quickening*, which, according to this film, apparently never happened. Then the illusion of plot collapses completely when MacLeod gets shot in a New York alley and in the next scene is being frantically dollied to an Emergency Room. Now who in New York would look twice at a shot guy in a deserted alley, let alone ring it in? Then it gets even more idiotic. Fast.Upon awakening on the hospital dolly, his wounds healed, MacLeod becomes violent and the obviously unfit-to-practice doctor diagnoses him as insane in three seconds of fighting interns, drugs him and sends him to the lunatic ward. The only apparent reason for this seems to be to execute one of those screenwriter pitch scenes Kane's medieval henchman stalking MacLeod through modern hospital corridors (how he located him in this facility - with no time for even an *efficient* hospital's paperwork to be processed - is beyond comprehension) and, though MacLeod is randomly trying to find an exit and the henchman is stalking purposefully, somehow both end up in the same basement laundry room. After all that setup - the shooting, the dollying, the lunatic ward, the stalking &#150; MacLeod kills the henchman quickly with no fanfare and the movie moves on, into further contrived plot less-ness.The swordplay was choreographed by Young Billy from the sixth grade. A suitable nomenclature would be air-guitar sword-fighting, i.e. rather than actually trying to slice and dice each other's bodies, the opponents slash at the AIR above each other's heads and parry these strokes as if they were vital. In one sequence, Kane (played by Mario Van Peebles, a talented actor/director, heinously miscast here) slashes at MacLeod, who parries Kane's stroke, only to have his sword shatter under Kane's blow. Kane's follow-through, which should have then neatly severed MacLeod's head, doesn't go anywhere near it &#150; what then, was Kane slashing at? Sultry Debra Unger plays The Chick and - like Roxanne Hart from *Highlander* &#150; is aroused uncontrollably by the concept of Immortality, her foreplay also being the sight of MacLeod getting stabbed. Guess immortality is a magnet for sexual loonies&#133;.Stereotypical moron cops, whose gratuitous swearing seemed unfamiliar to their untrained-actor mouths, hound MacLeod, whilst Kane kidnaps MacLeod's child, setting up the conundrum where The Hero can't kill The Villain because he alone knows where The Hero's child is.But MacLeod kills Kane anyway. So much for strategic conundrums.After the explosive climax &#150; not describing the level of excitement, but rather, that there were many gratuitous explosions set off - when MacLeod is once again levitated with the electric ecstasy of being The Last Immortal Ever &#150; ahem, again &#150; his son walks nonchalantly down some stairs and reunites with him as if he's just walked in from the kitchen.To put the weak capper on an altogether limp movie, an impotent rock song sings us out over the end credits.Where's Sean Connery when he's least needed?

Where the first Highlander couldn;t decided whether it wanted to be a beautifully filmed sword and scorcery movie or a trashy action movie and the second was more of a sci-fi movie this one gives us an even mix of unexplained flashbacks and modern time fight scenes. Christepher Lambert returns as the scottish clansman who is still speaking in a french accent and wearing his scottish clansman attire of blue jeans and white sneakers. This time he is up against Kane, a scorcer who provides us with the best Highlander villian yet. The absence of Sean Connery as Rameriaz hurts this movie quite a bit but for fans of the series of someone looking for some corney fantasy movie that doesn't involve the use of many braincells will find this enjoyable mostly due to the great special effects.

This left a problem though, as Mcleod was supposed to have become The last surviving immortal  at the conclusion of the previous film. Easy peasy - lets just unearth another one that has been entombed for centuries in an impenetrable underground cavern.Van Peebles scowls well and revisits most of the antics Kane thought up in the original. He ends up much the same way too unfortunately for him! A bit of the old Kung Fu  grasshopper philosophy tossed in and to keep up audience interest some illusionary effects here, but come Oscar Night there was NEVER going to be an envelope on the table containing a card bearing the words And the Best Film award goes to  HIGHLANDER 3 THE RIP OFF, I mean ladies and gentleman....THE SORCERER!

Although the fans did not like this part, it made me love highlander. The soundtrack is very nice, there was one song i really liked in the movie, i think it was BONNY PORTMORE. I am not sure but i think that was it. The story of Macleod is pretty sad. I think noone should live forever. I really liked Lambert. I would marry him if i were a woman =) Nice movie. Nice scenes. The villain (mario van peebles) is pretty evil and too FUNNY. I liked the scene where he is in the car with macleods son. It shows that you can do lots of funny things if you have supernatural powers. By the way can you tell me why heros should have sex at least for one time in these kind of movies??? I cant understand this. Why is having sex so important? i think people should grow up and dont give a damn to these kind of useless things. A man is still a man even if he does not sex. This just makes me sick. I think platonic love is more important than everything. Think about it.

If I wanted to watch these movies based on continuity alone I'd be sent to a mental institution.So far these is how I place the movies.  1 being the best 1. Highlander 2. Highlander Endgame 3. Highlander The quickening 4. Highlander Final Demension.As for the TV series.  It never really interested me.  It usually ended up trashing the film series and I happened to really like the best couple.

Of course is lower than Highlander II but is much better than Highlander I. This movie has a lot of action and suspense, specialy the last scene.

For me Highlander 2 and 3 are insults to the first movie, 2 and 3 should of never have been made.Since i'm a massive fan of the first Highlander movie, I was really disappointed in Highlander 2 and 3.Once again Connor Macloed (Christopher Lambert) has to battle against another evil immortal to win The Prize. This time Connor is up against Kane the sorcerer played by Mario Van Peebles and as you have probably guessed by now Connor defeats Kane and win The Prize for the 3rd time!Highlander 3 is a pretty boring film, but better than Highlander 2.THERE CAN BE ONLY ONE HIGHLANDER MOVIE AND THATS THE FIRST ONE!If you have any questions or comments about the Highlander movies please e-mail at destroy_souls@yahoo.com.

Do you even call it a film? I had no idea what I was watching. Me and my friend stayed up until very late in the night and early morning watching this film. We couldn't stop laughing. The movie was ridiculous! Remember the chinese man that got his head chopped off...and was still doing a maniac laugh? What was that?! And how the movie is set one minute in ancient Tibet, then in modern Japan, then in Scotland, then in 18th century France and finally in the USA? Okay, so the scenery shots of Scotlands mountains were nice and it really did set the scene. But there were alot of props in the movie that didn't fit in. For example, where on EARTH did the trampoline come from for one of the actors to jump on it and fly to the ceiling or something, where did the fire come from when the man and woman are kissing in the mountians in the middle of nowhere and there were a load of others that I won't mention. It was one of the craziest movie I've ever seen. It was a complete criminal waste of movie money. I've never seen the first 2 Highlanders, and I don't think I want to.

I loved the first Highlander. This is just a pathetic rehash of the first movie. Boy meets girl, girl finds out he's immortal, bad guy takes the hero's loved one, goes on scary car ride, except for this time it's with the hero's son, etc. The first movie was a masterpiece of sci-fi. One of my all time favorite films. Full of characters you cared about, even the ones that you loved to hate, i.e. Clancy Brown as the Kurgan. I am completely at a loss as to why they have to try and follow a great movie like that with trash like this. I must say I have never been a fan of sequels, but this one is the worst one I have ever seen. A complete and utter travesty.

Wow, really lame. Every scene is more lame than the preceding scene. It's a true monument to lameness. I'm watching it right now. I hope that something non-lame happens eventually, but I doubt it.Where did this little kid come from? I have no idea, and I couldn't care less. Why does Highlander keep getting arrested and hassled by the man? That's not what Highlander is supposed to be about... it's about sword fighting action and Sean Connery's hilarious accent. I like the way that the villain in this one has a similar smoker's voice to Chris Lambert. I guess that the villain is okay, not scary but vaguely hilarious. Man, the sex scene... boy was that bad. The female lead in this is pretty foxy, but all the scenes between them are utterly ponderous and slow. I think that I saw this movie years and years ago but then I forgot about it. That's how lame it is. Man, I hope that this kid buys it. Er, so this guy was trapped in some sort of tomb? I guess that's it. Man, I'm so disappointed; I thought that there was some time travel involved in this film. I love films with time travel. This one doesn't have any time travel. Just a lot of flashbacks. Don't watch it. It's bad. "},{"Title":"Bad film","Date":"8 November 2004","Score":"0 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Fantasy, Romance","Review":" Picking up where Highlander 1 left off and ignoring Highlander 2, Connor MacLeod (Christopher Lambert) is living a life of relative peace in the desert with his adopted son John, convinced that his victory against the Kurgan in 1985 gave him the Prize with which he can help humanity. Then his peaceful existence is shattered when another old enemy from the past, Kane (Mario Van Peebles), who killed another mentor/friend of Connor's (Mako), reappears and starts raising hell. While trying to thwart him, Connor meets a sexy blonde named Alex Johnson (the very sexy Debra Unger), who essentially looks like a blonde version of a red head he had in France during the revolution. Yet another poorly made sequel to the imperfect but enjoyably nutty 1985 sword & sorcery romp, this one ties with Highlander 2 for worst sequel in the series (Highlander 4, which features Duncan MacLeod, is slightly better if you're a fan of the show). Lambert goes through the motions while Van Peebles goes all out over the top in yet another clone of the Kurgan (even recreating the Kurgan's wild car ride from the first movie) who wouldn't last five minutes in the ring with him. The film's only real highlight is the very powerful sex scene between glum Lambert and prototypical sexy blonde ice queen Debra Unger, who probably ranks as being the best of the Highlander babes. A decent actress just to be fair, Debra is also an impossibly well built woman who looks great with or without her clothes on. The only thing that makes me recommend this for rental is the aforementioned very powerful sex scene that strips Debra of her clothes so that we can marvel at her athletic yet slender 5'7 body.

I have since seen the unedited version and found it to be much better. Despite being hated by Highlander fans and downright loathed by non-Highlander fans, I found the flick to be pretty good for a sequel. The first one, depending on your opinion, is an extremely powerful movie. It changed my views on the way action movies should be. Highlander sets the standard. Highlander III, on the other hand, sets the bar pretty low. It doesn't set out to be as deep or character-driven as the first one. It is for all intents and purposes, about making a buck off a classic. Normally I would condemn it for solely that reason, but I actually liked it enough to consider it a guilty pleasure. Would I openly admit to my friends that I like it? No. I would, however, recommend it for Highlander fans not expecting too much. It's definitely a guy flick, being all about action sequences, T&A, and style over substance. It also offers a gorgeous female lead and fine music. Not a great flick, by any means, though better than the other sequels so that's saying something. 7/10 "}]
