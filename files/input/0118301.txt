It's not meant to education; it's meant to entertain. Mark Paul Gosselaar  shines as a comedic actor, and his talents were further evidenced after he was an NYPD Blue  addition (a HUGE contrast from DMOC, obviously.) The premise is unique, and the acting was  good. Yes, it may lag a bit in the 2nd act and the writing can become a tad labored, but  nonetheless, this is a totally fun movie with great performances and hijinx. If you have not  seen it, get a group of friends together who actually have a sense of humor, get some good  eats, and have a blast.

The chemistry between the 2 leads is great and Mark Paul Gosselar sort of plays his role as Zack from SBTB for a more adult audience ( which i thought was genius), his charisma meant that I was never bored.why he never broke into the A list I don't know. but its all politics. It is one of the most quotable films i have ever seen,with so many great characters The comedy here is not for everyone but if you like films which don't take themselves seriously then this is for you. The soundtrack is also great and has Dust Brother as executive producers would you believe it (they did the soundtrack for fight club among others) The icing on the cake though is Cliff O Malley the insane party Animal who really should have got more screen time, he makes every scene he is in and I was just crying with laughter, he really is a match for Bluto.

All movies require a suspension of disbelief, as much of this is unbelievable, but it's a freakin' comedy! Not a statement on life. It pokes fun at a situation where many of us have been most of us go through a slacker phase where the world is just too tough and you have to forget, just relax a little... still don't get how if we all need this there are still so many consequences but I digress.Most of the intelligent stuff has been said already so I won't bore you by repeating the same sentiments.

Corey Page (from Heartbreak High) is completely phenomenal as the over-the-top angsty, brooding goth-rocker Matt and Lochlyn Munro (Charmed) is just too much as the crazy frat guy Cliff, these two guys gave us the best laughs.

In the midst of all the all-night beer blasts and sex, the two start flunking out.  They hear from a drunk, that if a roomate kills himself, then the other will be awarded a 4.0 grade-average.

This is definitely not an academy award winning movie, but it is quite a lot better than I thought it was going to be. I was afraid I was going to get stuck seeing that wacko Cliff guy make an ass of himself and the other two for 90 min., but luckily he was only in it for a minimal amount of time. Instead, the movie focused mainly on the relationship that develops between Cooper and Josh, as they both take on aspects of each other's personalities. It's a pretty relevant film for anyone living in a dorm; most college students should be able to relate to at least some of the situations Cooper and Josh get themselves into. And, unlike a few others who have commented, I did find some humor in several of the scenes.

Scott is a financially challenged student who came on an academic scholarship. Anything less than a B+ and he can kiss that scholarship goodbye. Gosselaar is a spoiled, rich party animal whose father threatens to cut him off and force him to clean toilets if he flunks out. After bombing their mid-terms, the boys need a miracle. A local in a bar tells them of a loophole in the school charter that will award anyone straight A's if their roommate dies. Since they have a spare bed now that their other roommate is always at his girlfriend's place, they decide to move in any potentially suicidal student and hope he dies. Maybe even help him do it if need be. Any hair-brained scheme like that is bound to lead to all sorts of complications, and it certainly does here. Most of them are absolutely hilarious.The film has several funny moments and decent performances. Mark-Paul Gosselaar has always been a dependable TV actor, and he provides several laughs as Coop. Most of them involve him disturbing his more serious roommate who is always trying to study. Tom Everett Scott plays the straight man Josh. He was supposed to be the next Tom Hanks back in the 1990s. This has yet to happen, but he is likable and continues to work regularly in television. The chemistry and timing is usually right on the spot between the two. Probably the next best thing about the film is the would-be depressed British rocker they move into their suite because he seems suicidal. It turns out this guy is the epitome of the word poser. Lochlyn Munro has some funny bits, but he might have been a little too much. Remember that John Belushi was not on the screen as much in Animal House, and that actually made him funnier. Sometimes less really is more.There is one hell of a lot of dope smoking and drinking in this film, but that's what college is all about for some people. Coop has a bong about as tall as he is. The film tries to redeem the two main characters in the final ten minutes by giving them a serious situation to deal with. Do they redeem themselves? Well yes and no. Well, actually no.

This is strange not because he is necessarily a bad actor, but because the only seemingly out of work TV actor who is less likely to make a comeback than Gosselaar is Rick Schroeder &#150; I didn't expect to ever see either of them again, and I STILL don't expect to see Schroeder any time soon. Gosselaar excellently portrays Cooper, a college kid from a rich past who has no interest in studying (having been kicked out of several colleges already, only to have his way paid into other ones by his father, a successful businessman), and only wants to party all day every day. I think that the idea to cast Gosselaar in this role was an excellent decision, because not only is it a unique casting choice (as well as fairly risky, given his heavily type-case iconography), but also because he just fit the character so well. Playing the other half of the odd couple presented in this film is Tom Everett Scott, who is not exactly a tremendously appealing actor either. He is Cooper's primarily unwilling roommate Josh, who is seriously intent on keeping up on his studies so that he can keep a prestigious and hugely important scholarship. Josh is the straightforward student here, the Jack Lemmon of the two guys, if you will. After having discovered the joys of partying, Josh scoffs at the hard-core studying life, parties a little too much, fails his midterms, and discovers that there is no possible way that he can ever get a high enough grade on his finals in order to keep his scholarship. Evidently, at their University, it seems that there is a rule written somewhere in the back of the school's charter that if a student commits suicide, that students roommate's will receive straight A's, as they are not expected to be able to keep up with their studies with all of the anguish that they must be going through. The majority of the film is spent watching the Josh and Cooper search the campus for people who look like unstable, and then try to get that person to move in with them before they kill themselves, therefore saving Josh and Cooper's grades. Clearly, the story here is nothing brilliant. The film is literally full of cheesy jokes and goofy situations, but it is still funny because it doesn't pretend to be something that it's not. There are even hilarious bits of dialogue that almost seem to be actively trying to remind the audience of the type of mindless comedy that this was meant to be (`I can hear my heartbeat through my penis!'). Besides that, we are given a side-splitting performance by Lochlyn Munro, an endlessly amusing actor who seems to have been born to play the nutcase that he played in Dead Man On Campus. This guy flawlessly gives some of the funniest lines that I've heard in a movie in years &#150; `They wanted to kick me out for not obeying quiet hours? Well, they can just suck my quiet COCK!' Sophistication? Class? Definitely not. Tear-inducing hilarity? Absolutely. This is some funny stuff.(spoilers) The film also redeems its childishness at the end of the film, in which Josh and Cooper's plans to manipulate their way into getting good grades are discarded and a healthier course of action is taken. It's amazing that a film that is dominated by this questionable plan to get straight A's is able to turn around and actually deliver something resembling a good message, and it is yet another quality of this great comedy. Dead Man On Campus has some of the same stupid characteristics of idiotic college comedies as American Pie and Road Trip, but it works on many other levels, and it doesn't sacrifice its dignity to get a few laughs. It's a low-brow comedy that respects itself, and that's a rare quality.

For starters, I thought that it would suck considering that Zack from Saved by the Bell was in one of the leads. Whenever a movie tries to cast a star from the early 90's/late 80's sitcoms, the result is almost always disasterous, but not this time. He was funny, fresh and almost unrecognizable with the black hair and new attitude. Tom Everett Scott is also funny and perfectly cast as the college roommate, intent (at first) on making the top grades and becoming a doctor. Only problems is Zack who creates a minefield of temptations, including drugs, girls and late night out which quickly sink his grade point average to failing. This leads to the plot If your roommate dies, you get straight A's. Of course, none of the above mentioned want to die, and since murder is out of the question, they start to look for suicidal candidates, with they can a share the dorm room with.This is where the movie gets fun. The candidates are all great characters with one exceptional one. A guy named Cliff. Cliff has to be one of the funniest characters I've ever seen, and especially in a movie like this, where the acting has to be taken with a grain of salt, he's a true standout.

Josh is a real student, whilst Cooper is a party guy who doesn't care about studying and getting prepared to the future. The acting as a whole is great, with highlights to Lochlyn Munro, who portrayed a extremely funny character. I couldn't stop laughing when he came in the scene, specially with all those unexpected screaming. The exception of great acting happens with Mark- Paul Gosselaar, whose job seemed to do a little... overacting. In the conversations scenes in the room, he seemed too conversationalist and gesticulatory for a normal dude. Also, it's interesting to notice that, albeit American society wasn't that liberal in the nineties, they've displayed Josh and Cooper as almost a couple, and they weren't antagonized for it.

While the ads seem to predict to a series comic situations arising from the search, the film also reveals itself to be a buddy flick, and surprisingly, a contemporary fable.The gags are standard fare, with occassional moments of unexpected hilarity from psychotic roommate-candidate #1, played by Lochlyn Munro (Scary Movie). The theme of the film is low-brow, but the absurdity of the situations bar the audience from any feelings of guilty conscience. In addition, instead of descending into immorality, there is a surprising show of heart by both leads, the first choosing to resuscitate a friend who really does attempt suicide, and the other declaring his loyalty when the former attempts to jump off a bridge. Ultimately, that's what the theme of the film boils down to friendship.Dead Man on Campus is a affable college buddy flick disguised as gross-out-teen-gagfest, though it manages to amuse and warm the heart without being overwrought.

Mark-Paul Gosselaar takes off the goody-two shoes of Saved by the Bell's Zack and tackles Cooper, a twisted version of his old role. Tom Everett Scott, who's quickly becoming a really fantastic actor, was equally amazing in his role as the goofy-but-cute roommate. Despite Gosselaar's great lines and even better delivery, Scott held his own.Besides the two main leads, I have to mention Poppy Montgomery and Alyson Hannigan. Montgomery plays Scott's love interest and I can't wait to see her in more films. She has a great mature-ness about her that just plays really well. Hannigan is just so sweet in her role as the ditzy Lucy. She's a familiar face in teen movies that many viewers need to know about.So what's wrong with Dead Man? Not much really. It has a little trouble with the seriousness of its premise, especially when someone does actually try to kill himself. Those scenes were tough to sit through, because you've been laughing for an hour about Cooper and Josh trying to kill of someone. When it actually happens, you're smacked with how wrong their idea was.The other thing is that Cliff's sequence probably should've been rewritten to be at the end of the film. It would've built up to a better climax.Despite those problems, I was really surprised this film didn't reach There's Something About Mary status. It had all the right things working for it, none of which I'll spoil for you. Maybe if it had From the directors of 'Dumb & Dumber' tagline, it would've done better.The neat thing is that if you look at the Box Office & Business link on the side of this review, you'll see that it actually got more and more business week after week. That means it got a lot of word of mouth traffic. Maybe you should take the advice. Rent Dead Man on Campus.7/15/00  "},{"Title":"release of laughter","Date":"12 July 2000","Score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy","Review":"  This is one of those movies where I just like to sit back with some hot food and a soda and feel free laugh out loud. It's funny to see two complete opposite guys forced together in a small dorm, and then to see them become best friends. I thought Mark Paul Gossalar annoying on Saved by the Bell, but here he had the best performance. Tom Everett Scott was funny as a mellow guy who gets put into an odd situation. Though I found the performances by the 3 girls annoying, the 3 roommates were great. There was the psychotic party animal, the paranoid geek, and the depressed and p***ed off rock star. The funniest scene was when Josh breaks the bong on purpose, Cooper drops and cries, and suggests they murder their roommate.I recommend Dead Man On Campus as a movie you can watch with friends or by yourself, just not in front of a strict adult.

Starting off with inventive opening credits (this as after all a MTV Production), college students Tom Everett Scott (of mediocre THAT THING YOU DO!-fame) and Mark-Paul Gossellaar (who wasted his time on silly teens sitcom Saved By the Bell and its numerous spin-offs) fail to get their grades right and hear of a school law, which would bring them A-grades, if their fellow roommate would kill himself. Therefore they cast all kinds of potential nerds and are sucked thereby more and more into trouble. Though the two leads, despite all their charm and on-screen-chemistry, turn more and more unsympathetic, the supporting cast is full of great talent in very funny characters, such as the prototype fat guy, black guy and ordinary guy, as well as intriguing variations, such as the musical-singing depressed future rock star, the sex-obsessed maniac and the paranoid computer freak. Their scenes only hint at what this comedy could have been with a better script and a far more ambitious director. Average, sadly.

The opening credits didn't dissuade my attitude, but as soon as the first 20 minutes were over, the movie and hence the jokes really started to pick up.  Everything prior to Josh getting his midterm grades is utter trash, but afterwards the movie is actually quite funny.I have to admit I had a soft spot for Gousellear's character Cooper.  The kind of humor that comes from his character is exactly the kind that will get me a cheap laugh.  I laughed very hard at several points throughout the movie, especially when Cooper pretended to be Bill Gates and the whole Flushles thing.While this review has been pretty favorable so far, this movie was not without problems.  It never really establishes whether or not it thinks what the characters are doing is wrong.  Once you think you have the answer(can't give away a hint), it throws a 180 on you. I also didn't like the Cliff character, which is strange considering every IMDB poster has loved him.  I thought the other two roomates, Buckley more so, had better scenes.  Another problem I had was with the pointless female subplot.  All of the scenes with females were dumb and unfunny, as well as the extremely stereotypical Kyle character.This really isn't a bad movie..I'm still in shock.  I'm giving this a 5/10.

The story revolves around two roomates, Cooper and Josh, Cooper is the typical student, there for the women and the beer, Josh is on a scholarship, and intends to study to the full and has to make a B+ average to keep his funding. As things fall apart for both students it seems the only way out is to move a fellow student in with them and to push him over the brink of suicide. The humour is black and deals with some morbid subjects, but none the less didn't suffer for this. The room mate they pick as their suicide victims are all completely of their trolleys in their own ways, and make the job of driving them to their deaths increasingly harder.

This story is based upon an age old falsehood that states if your college roommate kills them self in college, the surviving roommate gets a 4.0. Here you have Gosselaar (the old ZAK on `Saved by the Bell') partying like crazy in college and living with Scott, who is easily distracted by Gosselaar. Well the distractions take their toll and both Gosselaar and Scott are headed for collegiate non-return status, when they hear the 4.0 story. Now if you have been on a college campus as long as I have, you will come across a great deal of students who claim this is true and that it has happened to a friend of theirs at some college...well, you are mistaken..it never happened and never will.

What I found truly remarkable is that so much of this film rings true, unlike most teen/twenty-something comedies.The plot revolves around a dead man clause (something that actually exists at several universities, including Queen's).  Two college buddies find themselves failing, and after discovering that there is no mathematical way to raise their marks to a pass, decide to use the dead man clause to pass.  So, they try to transfer a depressed student into their dorm room and push him over the edge; if they succeed, they get straight As.While the movie itself isn't terrifically special (it won't win any awards of any sort), not only is there truth in how it depicts the residence experience, but almost every single joke comes across beautifully.

I assiduously avoided this film in the theatres because I don't feel (does this make me a prude?) that suicide is really a laughing matter. However, when I finally rented the film I realized it had less to do with death than good old college hijinks.Be warned The opening credits are fairly offensive, with how-to diagrams on the various methods of teen suicide. But once the film itself gets underway, likable roommates/felons/numbskulls Josh and Cooper will quickly win the viewer over to the movie's lighthearted look at post-secondary education in America.The most hilarious aspect of this film--the part that kept me chuckling long after I'd returned the video--is the way it takes popular stereotypes and runs with them. The paranoid computer geek, the dim college co-eds hopping from bed to bed, and the moronic party animal in the frat house are all played to great comic effect. (The funniest scene features an angst-ridden young rocker bloke who's almost too cartoonish to be real.)On a more serious note, as a member of an interracial couple myself it was a rare treat to see a number of such couples presented in the film. It's not often that such pairings appear onscreen without being the center of attention for their novelty. The producers at Paramount should be congratulated for presenting these couples as if they were the most natural and normal thing in the world--as they are!

It relies on the old urban legend concerning roommate suicide and the benefits that can be reaped from it, which technically classifies it as a dark comedy I suppose.  It still strays from the macabre and sticks with the slapstick. Mark-Paul Gosselaar portrayal of Scott Cooper has a Zack Morris on crystal meth feel to it.  The movie is definitely worth the cost of rental and if you can remember your freshman year you'll enjoy yourself.  For your own good don't allow yourself to be the person who goes into such a movie expecting cinematic brilliance.  Go in wanting to laugh.  You should succeed in that.

This is the biggest pile of crap I've ever come across at my local video store (and since i go to a locally-owned video store, they have a lot of small-time crap movies that aren't as bad as this one).  About the only thing good in this movie is Tom Everett Scott, who I gained ultimate respect for in That Thing You Do!.  I'm glad Mark-Paul Gosselaar was type-cast as the party type college student (Zack Morris has apparently transferred to a small college and changed his name to Scott Cooper as part of the witness protection program). Stealing a line from another comment, The laughter never stops.  That's because the laughter never starts.  This statement is absolutely true. This movie is very stupid.  If you want a true comic masterpiece that you will laugh your butt off, rent BASEketball or There's Something About Mary.  At least those two movies will make you think you spent your money wisely.  By the way, did I mention that this movie sucks?

There is nothing funny in the movie. There is  nothing believable. There is nothing to relate to.There were plenty of opportunities for female nudity, either to further the plot  or just gratuitous, which would have been at least one reason to see the movie,  but they were all missed.This shameful excuse for a movie is an embarrassment to humanity. Hollywoodshould disown all the people involved with the movie in any way.

It fails horribly as a comedy, because it is just flat not funny.  I've seen funnier things written on the bathroom stalls of truck stops "},{"Title":"Funny? Entertaining?","Date":"7 November 1999","Score":"3 out of 12 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy","Review":"  The answer to the questions above, would be no. Atleast in my opinion. OK, this movie might have a few funny scenes, but when you get to the middle of the movie, you just start to hope that it's not too much left of it. Because honestly, I started to feel bored. There's just not too much of a pace in the movie to keep you interested in what's going on....Which is really quite sad, because the idea behind the whole story could make for a really fun comedy. Too bad Dead Man On Campus never turned out to be just that!  "}]
