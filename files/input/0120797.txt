It's not really funny enough to be considered a comedy, and it's not really compelling/dramatic enough to be considered a good drama.  It attempts to pull off both at once, but never really succeeds.The pacing seems a little off.  You always expect the movie to pick-up at some point but it never really does.  It does manage to move along quick enough that it keeps you awake (barely), but I always found myself wanting the story to move someplace / anyplace to keep me more interested than I was.The story itself primarily centers around the antics of Nick Falzone (John Cusack) and Russell Bell (Billy Bob Thornton), both of whom are air traffic controllers.  To it's credit, I've never seen a movie about ATC's, but at the same time Nick and Russell could have been in any other profession and the story would have held up.  I sometimes think the writer chose ATC's simply because no one else had done it.The main conflict centers around Nick's desire to out-do Russell.  Why he feels the need to do this is never adequately explained.  It's also somewhat of a mystery as to what Nick is hoping to accomplish by out-doing Russell.  Most of their competitions are basically irrelevant and don't prove much anyway holding onto a match the longest, shooting freethrows, stacking as many planes into a queue as possible, etc, etc.  Their battle of wits, as it were, eventually begins to involve their significant others.  Unfortunately the respective wives (Blanchett and Jolie) are seemingly little better than pawns in Nick and Russell's bizarre and meaningless mind game.  They don't have much depth of character, nor any wants/desires of their own (beyond the superficial), and, as a result, you don't really care what happens to them.So, in short, Pushing Tin isn't that funny (though I seem to remember it being billed as a comedy) nor is the story engaging enough to be considered a good drama.  As noted in my header, it's not a bad movie, but it isn't that good either.  Worth a rental if you've seen everything else.I rate it 5/10.

So many movies these days have well-written characters but not the thriving screenplay to back them up. At last, we can enjoy a film with strong comic performances, smart dialogue, and an engaging atmospheric environment.	The film stars John Cusack as a hot shot air traffic controller named Nick Falzone, nicknamed the zone because he is truly the best at his profession. He lives in New Jersey with his happy housewife, Connie, and their son. (who is seldom mentioned or seen.) He has an intense, stressful work life, enjoys having fun with his co-workers, and seems to have a pretty optimistic look at life.   	All things change, however, when Nick meets his new neighbor, Russell Bell. He's a roughneck motor cycle-driving, quiet and challenging man who really needs to shave. Nick immediately feels tension between Russell and himself. And it just so happens that Russell is also an air traffic controller, making things even more competitive between these two individuals. The two soon begin efforts to try to impress the other, in and outside the job. 	The personal battles between Nick and Russell soon put each of them in bed with the opposite's wife. Nick is the first to commit adultery when he falls for Bell's highly attractive young wife, Mary. While he meant well, by taking her out for dinner after observing Mary sobbing at the grocery store, when they got home, things obviously got out of hand.  	The movie is very detailed both in the workplace and in its colorful, intriguing characters. The original tasting flavor of being placed in an air traffic control tower is quite captivating. The characters stare at the plane monitors like children at a television screen while playing a video game. The characters themselves are relevant, ordinary people, which is why they are so easy to relate to. Even though some of their personalities and motives are instantly obvious, we still have lots of fun watching their everyday living style	While some comedies would eventually regulate into a formalistic climax and follow predictable events, Pushing Tin is too smart for that. The ending is happy and light hearted, but it's most of the fun getting there. Mike Newell, director of Four Weddings and a Funeral, knows exactly what he wants out of the actors here, and they do exceedingly well at giving what he requires. Each fits their character perfectly, especially Cusack, Jolie, and contributing an Oscar worthy performance, Thornton.	Pushing Tin offers a variety of  characters and contrasts them effortlessly. In particular, during a just-for-fun basketball game, Nick makes a sudden bet for $100 that Russell can not make a hoop from a certain point in the court. Russell excepts. Nick nervously changes his gamble to fifty cents, but Russell stands firmly on the original amount. He shoots...and misses. Close enough, Russell, pardons Nick, Lets call it even. Russell walks over to him manly and states You either make it or you don't, as he hands Nick the cash promised. The chemistry between these characters is as effective as pouring oil in to water. And that is exactly how it is designed to be.Brought to you by 20th Century Fox.

Its about competition, not ordinary competition but the kind of obsessive rivalry that causes you to focus so much on your rival that you forget about the things that really matter in your life, and you begin to act in a way that is destructive. The movie is also about letting go and getting your life back again.I do think it was a mistake to categorize this movie as a comedy, which could lead people to expect a wacky Airplane sort of movie.  Pushing Tin is not a ha-ha sort of comedy. It has a subtle humor that is inherent in the absurdity of the aspect of human nature that is being portrayed. It does have some of the exaggeration of comedy, i.e. some of the events are not the sort of thing that really happens in reality. But the underlying emotions and situations are real, and watching the movie I had that feeling of recognition, of truth, that you get with a movie that has something to say to you.I was interested in the movie from the first few moments of watching it, and remained fascinated throughout, so I can't agree with those who think it was slow or uneven. The ending was sweet enough that I didn't care if it was a bit unrealistic. I think Mike Newell did a good job, the story was good, and the acting was wonderful. I intend to buy this movie when I get a chance because its one I could see many times and would like to share with others.

Why? In a word, pride. Perhaps false pride at times, but pride nonetheless. The U.S. air traffic control system handles more traffic in a single day than any other country does in a week. Check the numbers, kids. It's true. The training is rigorous and relentless, and, at the risk of sounding like a commercial for the Marines, if you happen to be the one out of about a thousand who makes it through training to become a full performance level controller, it becomes a badge of honor. Very few people can do it. It is a close-knit family, which was also displayed in the film. If you'll notice the scene where a particular departure didn't tag up and one controller didn't notice it, several others jumped in to help out, and all joking and hazing stopped. Forgive my preaching, but this is the first movie that actually gave a somewhat accurate view of my profession, so hopefully I can be forgiven for being protective.

Cusack stars as a hotshot air traffic controller whose top dog status is threatened by the arrival of the equally gifted but enigmatic Billy Bob Thornton. Cusack's mounting rivalry with the inscrutable Thornton eventually consumes his personal life as he falls prey to Thornton's sexy wife (Angelina Jolie) and his marriage (to Cate Blanchett) gradually disintegrates. Director Mike Newell showed great flair in balancing comedy and drama in 1994's Four Weddings And A Funeral, but here the mix is less assured and the extremes far too close together. Only fitfully amusing, Pushing Tin too rarely concentrates on its examination of air traffic controllers and their daily stresses, opting instead for a simple one-upmanship plotline with a superficial and sometimes flippant look at the men and women within whose hands we entrust our lives. The four leads are more than adequate in their roles, though the characters portrayed by Blanchett and Jolie (excellent during her brief appearances) are all but forgotten for long stretches at a time. As for rental possibilities, visibility should remain zero.

One is Nick Falzone, played by John Cusack, who as the hotshot of his workplace is happily married to one Connie (Cate Blanchett) with two kids. Into his life comes the notorious new air traffic controller Russell (Billy Bob Thornton) with his beautiful wife Mary (Angelina Jolie). The two men do not react well to one another and spates of jealousy and male rivalry, with consequences, ensue..To it's credit `Pushing Tin' at least has an original setting - I can't recall another movie about air traffic controllers. Of course its merely a premise for male ego bating, a long running plot concept of countless movies. Here the bating takes place in trying to outdo one another in all aspects - work, social esteem and even with one another's wives. This leads us to the comedic events of this comedy. The comedy here is very soft, as the movie has a more comedy/drama mould to it than being ostensibly an all out comedy. Cusack's performance here is quite manic, as he winds himself up trying to outmatch his peer. As usual it's also quite good - Cusack has a great sense of being an actual character rather than an actor portraying a character. He works very well with the material he's given portraying a character that - while not as well drawn as his roles in such movies as `High Fidelity' and `Grosse Point Blank' - is nonetheless flawed, but still worthy. Thornton's character is the laconic counterpoint, laidback about the situation for most of the time but with a sense of energy and vitality brimming beneath. Thornton once again turns in a neat performance, with just enough character embellishments and detail to lift his character from blandness into quasi-life. Unfortunately Blanchett and Jolie - as the objects of affection - can do little with their limited material and serve merely as surfaces for the two leads to bounce off.The problem with the movie lies in the pacing of the script. Considering the intensity of the job, there's no pressure ever evident in the movie in either the script or direction (courtesy of Mike Newell). Even the manipulation of planes, using some graphics and actual plane shots, lacks any urgency. Thus the comedy tends to amble along to a rather drab finale. The drama elements are adequate and the performances flesh out the characters, but there's not enough originality to make it avid viewing. Therefore you'd expect the comedy elements to balance it out. Alas, while there're some smiles to be had, there's very few laughing aloud moments. Sure the characters neuroses and clashes can create some amusing sparks but they're not frequent enough, nor sharp enough to sustain this movie as a comedy. Thus, overall, the movie is grand and passable but there's nothing to really warrant much of a look in, except to see the works of two strong Hollywood actors. 5/10.

While the stresses of the job were well emphasized, the side plots were sophomoric. The main character, played by John Cusack, was too immature. He spent all his time goofing off and showing off. Probably not likely to survive very long in the real career. The relationship between he and his wife (Blanchett) was sappy. They were supposed to have two kids, one of them on Ritalin, but they were shown only briefly in one scene. The ending was just plain schmaltzy.There were a few things I liked about the movie. One guy makes a mistake, and two planes barely miss each other. One controller openly mocks and insults him. Obviously, the poor guy never established clout. However, Cusack's character has clout, because he knows how to schmooze. When he messes up, the other controllers are more empathetic. That's true in real life. Much of success in any career is establishing clout among your co-workers. Aside from that, the movie was not very enlightening.

A real scream - Billy Bob Thornton is one of those guys who can be hilarious (and kinda scare you at the same time) without ever opening his mouth. His eyes are silent movies. John Cusack is funny in a cute, desperate sort of way that makes you totally relate to what he's feeling. Cate Blanchett amuses us yet again with her chameleon-like ability to completely become a character you've never seen her as before, complete with appropriate accent, effortlessly carried.Watch it a second time, though, and you'll realize that this movie portrays how completely a person can screw up their own life by the attitudes they decide to adopt, and the way they react to the people around them. Cusack's character, The Zone Falzone, would like to think that his life is falling apart because of the new guy at work, but in reality every problem he's got is his own damn fault... a good lesson for all of us to chew on.Interesting note The guy who plays Cusack's work buddy is currently starring as Patricia Arquette's husband on the TV series Medium. He's very cute, now that he's lost the 80's stache and grown his hair out. He kinda reminds me of Steve Perry, with lighter hair. Not a bad thing.As always, the presence of Angelina Jolie in a movie adds a whole lot of sexual tension, and a little bit of insanity. I love, love, love her. I want to bite her lips off, chew them, and blow bubbles.

The story is so pointless and boring that I find I care nothing for any of the characters, which to me is suicide for the movie.The entire premise seems to be how hardcore these two guys can be, and the neverending testosterone struggle between the two to constantly one-up the other guy. Various shots of Cusack running around the flight tower, guiding planes in and making them make all kinds of sudden, unsafe dives, etc. is supposed to leave us rolling on the floor, but instead he comes off as cold and uncaring about the people on the plane who could easily die as a result of his stupidity and is mostly annoying.Another hardcore scene involves Billy Bob Thornton standing on the runway just behind where huge jets are landing. The powerful rush of air that hits the asphalt as the plane comes in throws Thornton through the air like a leaf in a tornado, and the next scene we see is of Thornton's face with a big post-coital smile on it. Stupid and ineffective. A complete waste of great acting talent.Angelina Jolie appears for a total of about 10 minutes and has about 6 lines in the whole movie.In summation, this movie should never have been made.

John Cusack plays such an individual as he is admired by co-workers. When Billy Bob Thornton shows up as the new employee, competition enrages. When Cusack encounters Thornton's wife an affair happens. He has a nervous breakdown as the affair becomes public knowledge. Directed with insight by Mike Newell and backed with fine production. Previously Newell directed the acclaim Four Weddings and a Funeral. Cusack is superb as a guy smitten with jealousy and guilt but ultimately must face consequences. Billy Bob Thornton plays an interesting individual with a daredevil past. His methods of dealing with the affair are intriguing. Angelina Jolie as Thornton's wife is a more predictable element but played with intelligence as she deals with the mistake. Cate Blanchett plays Cusack's wife who is somewhat standard in her position in the story but well played as she becomes the victim.

The film then ends with a wholly unconvincing and unearned message. Prior to this, it contained a number of superb aerial shots of New York City, a memorable opening sequence, and a strong first act.Incidentally, Tin's first half tantalises us with the possibility that Thornton's character is egoless, not feuding with Cusack and that Cusack's own insecurities have essentially created a false rival out of Thornton.

In context, to many on the outside world they are also sick and sad at the same time.The plot is more a device to move the character of Nick No Fly Falzone through the movie. Billy Bob Thornton's character Russell Bell is never fully developed, making him two dimensional.In no way is his character equal to Nick, no matter how the movie poster and ads portray him.To get an idea of how funny this movie is, within the first ten minutes we have Mrs. Falzone (Cate Blanchett) being asked by her husband You're happy, aren't you Connie?. Half an hour into it we see the controllers getting liquored up at a bar-b-que while the wives discuss dealing with the grinding jaws of their husbands.By the time Russell and Nick are requesting more planes, and Russell gets the 747 you can see where this movie is going. Yeap, Russell is going to move Nick outside of his comfortable place in life.This film doesn't tie itself in a pretty little bow. If you are looking for that, I recommend another film.

Basically Nick 'The Zone' Falzone (John Cusack) is one of many air traffic controllers at New York airport, a fast-paced job with a no-room-for-error attitude, Connie (Cate Blanchett) as his wife, and the reputation as the king of pushing tin. But then enters reckless new transfer Russell Bell (Billy Bob Thornton), and so begins a quiet little battle for ego and status. You could question whether Nick slept with Russell's wife Mary (Angelina Jolie, Thornton's real wife at the time) for an ego boost or for genuine affection, but either way, Russell is very quietly planning something as payback. When a big emergency occurs at the airport, something to do with some terrorists hijacking planes or something, only Nick and Russell stay behind, and when it's all over, Russell is presented as the hero, Nick is presented as a wimp. I can't really remember how everything is settled in the end, but it is. Also starring Jake Weber as Barry Plotkin, Kurt Fuller as Ed Clabes, Vicki Lewis as Tina Leary and Matt Ross as Ron Hewitt. With good performances by Cusack and Thornton, and a good behind-the-scenes insight into the airport world, it is I suppose a likable comedy drama. Worth watching!

The flame of his marriage dimmed out a little throughout the years but basically he's got all his ducks in a row, having mastered his job and being the undisputed king of his workplace. A series of opening-scenes document Nick as a popular jester and a charming womanizer. Confidence, popularity and fulfillment are the keywords. He's always been the pilot of his life, skilfully steering it away from near-crashes or even turbulence, however it goes into a tailspin when new colleague Russell Bell (Billy Bob Thornton) joins his work group. Their rivalry drives both men to the edge of lunacy, they strain every nerve to annoy each other and what starts out as innocent taunting turns into mean-spirited attacks. When Nick sleeps with Russell's wife(a seductive turn by Angelina Jolie) both marriages threaten to fall apart and Nick's fear of reprisal combined with the high stress factor of his profession - uneasy lies the head that wears the crown - start to prevent him from competently executing his job and lives hang in the balance...The setting's well-chosen for the mind games, it's conceivable that battles for the alpha-male position take place in stressful, highly competitive work environments, in this case air traffic control, where the air is loaded with more testosterone and adrenaline than among firemen or wall street traders. Anti-stress devices and methods grace the screen abundantly, from biceps-training hand pumps and stress relieving squeeze balls to zany ailments such as letting a landing plane overhead; the turbulence causing one to spin right off the ground into a sort of whirl motion (making for one of the movie's best scenes). A couple of problems stare you right in the face, first of all the rivalry between Cusack and Thornton never takes a sufficiently interesting form. Sure, the relationship isn't completely frictionless but it's hard to believe Cusack ever threatened Thornton's masculinity, whereas it more or less works the other way around. Cusack being his usual smooth-talking charmer seems harmless, and when Tornton admits near the end of the movie he loathed Cusack's character to such degree he scared himself, literally wanting to kill his rival, I didn't believe him for one second.With 2 hours runtime, the film still appears too short to be able to work out all plot lines, the marriage issues subplot never reaches takeoff speed which causes the ending to fall totally flat. If one can turn a blind eye to the less than satisfying resolution, you'll find plenty of subtle comedy treats along the way. 'Pushing Tin' isn't the kind of comedy one can enjoy watching with one eye on the screen whilst doing something else. The fun usually lies in half-sentence jokes, looks between characters and charming one-liners you need to prick up your ears for to catch all subtleties. The sharp dialog (If you ever want to sleep at night, don't marry a beautiful girl. ) and the cast's performance gives this lukewarm rom-com an edge over it's peers.

As such, the film might not quite be what you'd expect, and can't seem to decide whether it's a comedy or a drama while strangely never seeming to be a combination of the two.Air traffic control is apparently one of the most stressful jobs around and, as such, you'd think there'd be a rich seam worth mining, but I can't recall many &#150; if any &#150; other films that use it as the core of their story. I suppose the makers should be given credit for delivering a different setting for their tale, but they really should have worked harder on the character development than they do here.

But the movie as a whole is just OK. Not dreadful, definitely interesting but something seems a bit lacking. I wouldn't call this a great movie but it's moderately involving although it develops slowly.Cusack and Thornton both turn in good performances as do Jolie and Blanchet as the wives. I really really thought Billy Bob was incredible and he jumped out at me the most. It was weird watching this because it came out a long time ago and seeing Jolie and Blanchett was a kick. I thought they were both great in somewhat small roles though Cate's was larger then Jolie's. The part of the confused Nick could have been tailor made for Cusack but it is Billy Bob who comes close to stealing the film at times as the complex and quiet Russell.Pushing Tin, even though it had a great cast, with complex characters doing fascinating work, wasn't as good as I'd hoped it would be. First off, it takes a rather long time to get going(there were times the movie didn't really seem to have much of a plot) and even once it does get going it drags at times. And the brief bits of the air traffic controllers themselves, hard at work, were so involving I wished there were more of those scenes. Ultimately the rivalry between Nick and Russell was not all that interesting, it was more on the obnoxious side and came this close to actually being rather dull. It did become interesting when Nick goes to visit Russell in Colorado. In fact the scene by the water is just great. But it takes SO very long to get there and a lot of what happens along the way isn't terribly interesting. I didn't like Nick very much at all through most of the movie although that changed a bit after the above mentioned scene with Thornton. But there was a flatness to a lot of the movie, and a lot of it didn't seem to flow real well either. I was rather disappointed.Ultimatelty I wish the story had focused less on the power struggle of Nich and Russell and more on the relationships between all the people. The moments where the audience sees these people on the job are thrilling but there's not enough of them. And I wish there had been more characters and a different sort of main plot. I don't think this is dreadful or even bad. I would give it a 6 or 6.5 of 10. I don't think this is the type of film where one would turn it off mid stream but I do think it could have been better.

Supporting performances from Angelina Jolie (as Russell's wife Mary) and Cate Blanchett (as Nick's wife Connie) are serviceable but fail to compensate for a lackluster story in which Nick's buttons are pushed predictably by Russell. Perhaps the most interesting thing about this dark comedy is that it was produced just a few years before 9/11; if one were to make such a film today (with much of the dark humor focusing on near-collisions of jetliners caused by overstressed air traffic controllers) it would probably be seen as being in extremely bad taste, but I suppose one should judge the movie on its own merits.

He rather grudgingly admitted that it was fairly accurate (he is somewhat grumpy because he doesn't like Billy Bob Thornton & didn't want to give him the credit).  He did say that the scene involving the main characters on the runway and a big ole' airplane was far-fetched.  That aside, this was a very entertaining film in my estimation. I liked the fact that John Cusack's character (Falzone) catches nine kinds of hell because of a stupid decision that he makes. He certainly should've known better than to do what he did with Angelina Jolie's character (Mrs. Bell) & he doesn't get to walk away scott free from his idiocy.  Billie Bob's character (Bell) sees so thoroughly to that that you almost feel sorry for Falzone by the end of the film - ALMOST.  Watching Bell mess with Falzone's head in my opinion is the best part of this film.  The interaction between these two characters is played to perfection by Thornton and Cusack.  The tension and chaos portrayed within the tower was somewhat unnerving but engrossing to watch.  The bomb threat scene between Bell and Falzone and the ripped-off feather is my favorite. The leading ladies in this film (Ms.'s Blanchett and Jolie) turned in spotless performances as well in my opinion.  Kudos to both for their abilities to get their respective regionalisms down pat and make them totally believable.  Considering that Jolie grew up in New York and plays a southerner, and Blanchett is an Aussie and plays a New Yorker, and you never stop during the story to question where they're really from speaks volumes of their acting abilities.  I disagree with one of the other reviewers who state that these ladies talents were wasted in this film;  they had simple parts to play and they both played them with simple, understated perfection.  All in all an entertaining, sometimes funny and absorbing film. Ya'll go get it.

First you empathise with the charming, witty and competent John Cusak. He is the natural leader of a bunch of harried New York air traffic controllers who finds his authority challenged by a rude Billy Bob Thornton who thunders onto the scene as an enigmatic, disdainful rival.Then suddenly, he lets us down. For, while Thornton is cold, distant but, indeed, better at what he sets his mind to do, it turns out that Cusak has human failings. Unfortunately for the viewer, however, he has far too many of them.We see him slump from the life and soul of the party to a state of near paranoia in a sorry character transformation that, if nothing else, highlights the futility of human endeavour when this is merely to be better than the next guy.For a comedy there is much unhappiness portrayed here, with mental illness, drunkenness and infidelity being just some aspects of this, although the recurring drama around the work of air traffic controllers does add spice to and energises the film.A little too much behavioural change is asked of Cusak's character for it to ring true, despite a good performance by the actor, while Thornton is more effective in an easier role. Support from the wives (Cate Blanchett and a one-dimensional Angeline Jolie) is adequate.Overall, Pushing Tin is worth catching as an interesting look at human failure that possibly tries to cover more latitude of emotion than it is comfortably possible to do in a little over two hours.

It's a maddening, high-tension profession that takes it's toll on those who would enter upon it's nerve shattering, demanding playing field; definitely not a job for the meek of heart or mind.  Nick Falzone (Cusack) is one of the guys who can handle this adrenaline-laced life and still manage to keep it all together for his family  His wife, Connie (Cate Blanchett), and their two kids.  But things begin to happen when a new man, Russell Bell (Thornton), arrives on the job; a cool, off-beat character from out west who brings along a reputation for moving planes quickly, and a much younger wife, Mary (Angelina Jolie).  Soon Nick's competitive juices begin to flow, and the tension level in the control room goes up a notch. 	Cusack turns in a high-powered performance as Falzone, a character perfectly suited to his quick delivery and sense of timing; he's high-strung, but controlled, and Cusack very capably conveys the myriad emotional levels derived from a job with such incredible responsibilities.  As one of the characters comments in response to a remark about the blips on their screens being like a big video game, `Yeah, but there's no restart button.'  What this job requires is an amazing amount of energy and a clarity of mind few mortals it would seem could maintain for any great length of time.  One of the interesting asides of the film is watching the minor diversions used by the various individuals to keep their focus (Falzone sings to himself, others make wagers and exercise).  It's a game of fast talk and quick wits, and Cusack's Falzone is a master at it.  His counterpart is Russell, played with a subtle, low-keyed approach by Thornton, whose calm in the middle of the storm lends something of an air of mystery to the proceedings.  He's enigmatic, wears an Indian feather at work, keeps his thoughts to himself and leaves little doubt that he marches to the beat of his own drummer.  And Thornton makes it all click to perfection.  Blanchett also turns in a noteworthy performance as Connie, a strong character who is the anchor in Nick's tumultuous life; and beautiful Jolie is also memorable as the more vulnerable and unpredictable Mary Bell. 	The strong supporting cast includes Jake Weber (Barry), Kurt Fuller (Ed), Vicki Lewis (Tina) and Matt Ross (Ron).  Newell has crafted a highly entertaining, fast paced movie with snappy dialogue, a good story, and a cast that makes it all work.  `Pushing Tin' is a funny, yet serious, look at relationships and a unique profession for which the phrase `burned out' must have been coined.  And you'll never forget the hilarious scene that involves a man standing on the runway as a 747 lands; it's something you have to see for yourself, because words alone will not do it justice.  Check this one out; it's a solid movie that will give you a whole new perspective on planes and those guys out in the towers moving them around.  There's a lot of sky up there, but it can get real small very quickly.  I rate this one 8/10.

There are scenes of gripping computer animated effects through the cyber maps of the air traffic controllers and it just feels like the filmmakers were just trying to make the job more exciting than it really is.

But ultimately, they're demonstrating the futility of trying to maintain control over one's life or one's surroundings.Interestingly enough, this is one of the few John Cusack movies where he plays a significant role as someone other than the typical Cusack... his fans know the role. A self-deprecating, extremely neurotic, overly talkative insecure man who happens to also be gifted and charming in really quirky ways. Think Grosse Pointe Blank or Say Anything. In this film, Cusack's character is really not a likeable guy (perhaps because he reminds a lot of us of characteristics in ourselves we don't like).I don't think Cate Blanchett or Angelina Jolie are wasted in this movie; they play very well into their roles, but don't exceed them and impede the point of the movie. While we're not really used to seeing Cate as a typical housewife, I think she does a very good job of highlighting the quiet insecurities and struggles many women in that walk of life endure. She never steals the show from Cusack and Billy Bob, but I found myself much more attracted to her character than either of theirs. Cusack's character is arrogant and horribly insecure, and Thornton's seems to fancy himself a guru simply because he's only slightly less active with his own insecurities than Cusack. These guys are a stereotypical pair of type A personalities.When all is said and done, though, this movie does a nice job of getting across a good lesson in life, all the while posing as a comedy (and it does have it's share of witticisms and excellent one liners). My only big quarrel with it is that the ending seems much too sugar coated; I won't ruin it completely for you, but after you see it (which you should) try to imagine it ending a bit more within the framework of the concept of being tossed into the jetwash of a 747, and liking it.

Cusack plays the cool Falzone, who eats stress for breakfast and is known as the best in the business. Though he handles his job with ease his life outside seems to revolve around driving fast, talking fast and trying to recapture the buzz of it all. Thornton on the other hand plays new guy in town Bell who doesn't know the meaning of stress and shatters Falzone's cosy world when his seemingly insane methods produce better results than his illustrious comrade. As has been mentioned the constant game of one-upmanship that these two men indulge in throughout the film is the central theme of the film and what it does to their lives and loves.

Nick Falzone (John Cusack) pushes tin. At the manic Terminal Radar Approach Control Center on Long Island, New York, he is the air traffic controller. That is, until Russell Bell (Billy Bob Thornton), half-Irish, half-Native American, all zen-cool, arrives. Whereas Falzone is intense and hyper-active, Bell could not be calmer and challenges Falzone's status as top dog. Their wives are polar opposites - Mrs Falzone (Cate Blanchett) blonde and ditsy, Mrs Bell (Angelina Jolie) dark and unstable. The tension between the two men inevitably leaks out of the workplace and into each other's marriages. The ensuing relationship entanglements are the failing of Pushing Tin. If you can manage to overlook the implausibility of anyone cheating on Cate Blanchett, even Cusack's cocky stress-case, then it is still some way short of captivating. Bell's attempt to exact revenge by seducing Falzone's wife is vague - we are never sure whether he is just making Falzone paranoid or whether they actually do the deed. The ending is unfortunately predictable and overly saccharine, reliant on a too-tidy plot device and a cheesy gimmick. That said, there are a great many things to recommend the film. The two leads are superb, Thornton (with a really good hair-piece) the perfect foil for Cusack's nervous energy. Blanchett, also, is excellent. Captivatingly powerful in Elizabeth, here she is all nail polish and fluster, conveying perfectly the stress of being married to Cusack. The air traffic control scenes are superb, with the changes in pace and tension, between monotony and catastrophe, handled with panache and a flair for the slangy terminology of which Americans are so fond. Pushing Tin is well worth seeing, but once again the promise shown by a good scenario and cast has been ruined by relationship issues and a happy ending.

I have never seen a film centred on the lives of air-traffic controllers, and the scenes in this film actually set in the control center are excellent; we get a real sense of the stressful, fast-paced world of air-traffic control, and the cynicism which helps the controllers survive the job.Had Pushing Tin actually been about a day in the control tower it could have really been something, especially with John Cusack and Billy Bob Thornton on board.  Unfortunately, after a promising start, the film bogs down in the complicated love lives of these two characters, who clash on sight and spend the rest of the film trying to one-up each other (at least until an unsatisfying happy ending).  Thornton and Cusack ultimately drag their wives into the picture, leading to a series of romantic complications I really did not care about, since the exciting air-traffic control scenes whetted my appetite for more.Why?  Why would Hollywood feel we would be more interested in a sluggishly paced romantic dramedy than a film about this fascinating profession?  Formula filmmaking strikes again, and Pushing Tin is the latest casualty.

This is the first John Cusack film where I sensed he was actually getting older. I looked at him in profile in one scene and I thought, omigawd, he's starting to look like Pete Townshend! Seriously though, this is a movie with the right balance of comedy and drama without making it a dramady.

He seems to have it all until a new transfer, Russell Bell (Thornton), comes to work with Falzone. Added to the mix is Mary Bell (Jolie), Russell's beautiful and attractive wife. Despite the talent assembled by Director Mike Newell, `Pushing Tin' was a movie that did not quite make any of my top ten lists. The plot of this film was a little confusing to follow. Bell is the new air traffic controller at Falzone's place of business and jealousy immediately shows its green eye as Cusack becomes jealous of Thornton's popularity at work and soon in his private life. Thornton's entrance on the screen was one that went well with the character he There were only a few things that I found amusing with the plot of `Pushing Tin.' There was only one joke that was truly funny and it didn't come from any of the major cast members. The other thing I enjoyed was how Cusack and Thornton's character played off each other.Cusack and Thornton meet face to face for the fist time in a bar for a dare to see who could hold a match the longest while it is still lit. `Pushing Tin' was a film that could have been a lot better if the audience saw more humor from Cusack and Thornton; therefore based upon the end result I give this movie a (C+) for its attempt at humor.

The main characters are airplane traffic controllers who compete with each other through different viewpoints.  Pushing Tin focuses on these two characters and how they deal with each other.  The movie lacks a strong plot, depth in the other supporting characters, and witty dialogue.  However, the symbolic paradigm behind the whole storyline that intertwines these characters into a tension-filled web is very captivating and fascinating once you see the forest and not the trees.If you have ever strove to be the best in something at any cost, then you may probably relate to the characters in this movie.  Don't read any further if you haven't watched it yet--the following contains comments on character development.Nick Falzone, played by John Cusack, is a John Cusack type of character.  He's a fast-talking, fast-driving, hot-shot tin-pushing top gunner who thrives on the stress-errorless nature of his job.  The stress he faces is deflected by his self-confidence.  He believes that he is the best man at his job and his nickname the Zone is what his close friends must call him.  When he meets Russell Bell for the first time on a motorcycle, there is an imminent, obvious hostility.  Like two wild animals defending their territory, these combatants are prepared to fight their little war.  Contrary to other movies where two guys are trying to one-up the other (i.e. Top Gun,   Face-Off), the approach of the two characters is the most interesting aspect of the movie.  This testosterone pumping movie with fast cars, big jets, young ladies, and basketball resemble all the elements in a macho men showdown.  These men push each other as hard as they push tin.  Falzone is usually the aggressor, the initiator of the push.  Russell Bell receives his push and deflects it by avoiding him.  Russell Bell's approach is similar to the I'll let you slap my other cheek idea.  He is so much at peace with himself that nothing perturbs him.  At least, not on the surface.       The supporting characters are merely undeveloped and in the background.  Russell's wife, Mary--played by a Charlize Theron double Angelina Jolie, is either seen draped all over Russell or throwing down a couple of vodka shots.  Connie Falzone, played by the Australian Cate Blanchett, is either trying to exert her independence or getting laid by her husband--literally and physically.  Nevertheless, the audience never has a chance to understand or relate to these characters because they may be merely pawns in this game between Russell and Nick.In addition, casting Billy Bob Thornton as Russell Bell is a good choice, but making him a half Native American is a little far-fetched like Morgan Freeman's character Red, who is an Irishman in the Shawshank Redemption. The film can be very ambiguous--but maybe the screenwriters intentionally made it so.  For example, I don't believe Connie when she said that she slept with Russell.  It doesn't make sense after Russell's transformation when he and his wife had a breakthrough with each other.  If Connie did sleep with him, why was she so upset at Nick when she initially found out that he cheated on her and then reverse her feelings while she was drunk on a plane.  I believe that Connie was willing to sleep with Russell, but their initial interactions seemed merely harmless.  I think that she was just playing on Nick's paranoia that she was sleeping with him.  On the other hand, she may have because we don't hear anything about that from Russell--or do we?Despite these shortcomings, the main point of the movie is clearly made.  Consider the scene where Russell is back in Colorado fishing in a cold stream as an allegory for the entire movie.  He catches a big fish when Nick arrives and rather than taking a picture of it, scaling and cooking it, telling stories about it, he merely lets it go.  When asked by Nick why he did that, Russell replied He knows I caught him... so I'm letting him go.When Russell arrived in NYC, he is only concerned with doing his job.  However, he runs into Falzone and they become competitors.      Nick is constantly biting at his line, and Russell is simply reeling him in slowly.  First he does a better job than Nick and then he shoots him up on the court.  He's just being himself when singing songs and learning French.  His eccentric background makes him a novelty in the eyes of Connie Falzone.  He stalls Nick's plane, which infuriated Nick, to save a passenger.  At that point, Nick is caught--and he doesn't know it.  Russell tries to throw him in the water, but Nick refuses to swim away.  It takes a whiplash from a 747 for Nick to get the point.Whatever your occupation may be, sometimes we find ourselves in a rat race where we have to be the best at everything in the eyes of others to make our point.  We become intense, irritable, and jealous.  Russell wears his feather in his cap when he works.  He doesn't care what others think of him, but he competes with himself and only himself.  That feather represents his own identity, and when Nick takes it away--Russell freaks out for the first time.  The same goes for Nick's nickname, The Zone.  When he is not addressed that way, Nick loses his own version of that feather.Maybe this rant is just a rambling about nothing.  Maybe this film is about nothing.  It all depends on what you can get out of it.

Of course the movies have not foresworn the use of air-traffic control characters altogether those of the movie-going public who fondly look back on Renny Harlin's action-packed Die Hard 2 can remember the background scenery which periodically ganged up against Bruce Willis in his efforts to pop a cap in the finely-tuned proverbial asses of the elite corps using the airport operations against them.  Pushing Tin tries to take a more realistic approach to the situation, portraying the chronic fatigue and dastardly human on-the-job interferences which even John McClane can't protect us against.  It's a good idea (apparently inspired by a New York Times article), yet Pushing Tin has decidedly unoriginal things to say once its various protagonists leave the office.John Cusack inhabits the high-strung, talkative liberal main character which has been his trademark performance since The Sure Thing.  Indeed he has a beautiful wife (Cate Blanchett) and a reputation for being the best and brightest of the tower, but hence it's not enough once the foreboding Billy Bob Thornton steps in.  Thornton's character represents a challenge for Cusack, one that eventually relegates itself into Cusack's bed-hopping with his alcoholic loose-cannon of a wife (Angelina Jolie). Indeed, as in most movies of this calibre, such an action spells doom for Cusack's marriage, just another visible stumbling block in a comedy which applies its plot conflicts with a trowel.Written by Glen and Les Charles (the creative forces between one of television's finest sitcoms Cheers), the film retains a meanderingly enjoyable tone its first hour before its mechanics set in.  Indeed Cusack is a likable character, and the chemistry he exudes with his buddies seems to be genuine.  But just like the inevitable sounds of a failing propellor, one begins to suspect the film's real intentions even while Jolie (a presence so dynamic she deserves more screen time than all the other characters put together) illuminates the screen.The film builds up to its climax with--of all things-- a bomb at the airport.  This is obviously where the Die Hard motif comes in, as I was half expecting good old Mr. Willis to burst through the door armed with a pair of tweezers and that Sixth Sense kid proclaiming the dead reception he prognosticates with this utter cardboard-cutout of a plot.Mike Newell's career has been built into breathing fresh air into the most overdone of plots.  His Four Weddings and a Funeral (though a tad overrated) used the standard romantic conception as a backdrop for Hugh Grant's bashful witticism.  And his Donnie Brasco (one of the better recent Mafia movies) refused to simplify the guidelines of that specific genre by shaping it as a philosophic tragedy of conscience. How ironic it is, then, when he's unable to purvey the original concept of Pushing Tin above anything other than a standard sitcom. Of course this is understandable due to its screenwriters' backgrounds, but in the end excuses do not make up for shallowness.  There's a certain preposterous ethic when making a movie about normal characters Pushing Tin claims to be about that requires a multitude of spice in order to render the material more palatable to Hollywood.  Unfortunately, I would have virtually no problem with simply holding up a mirror to regular characters I've always sympathized more with the disheveled guy on the sidewalk bench than any phony movie-star confection.  Unfortunately, the fundamental problem with Pushing Tin is that it goes out on a limb looking for the extraordinary when the ordinary would have done just fine.

Pushing Tin is about a mob of air traffic controllers, among whom there's only one woman, and she spends her time pumping iron. The gun controller is Zone played by John Cusack. He's married happily to Connie (Australia's Cate Blanchette) but becomes challenged when a quiet, mysterious and extremely clever controller called Russell (Billy Bob Thornton) turns up for work, along with his young buxom wife, played by Jon Voight's daughter Angeline Jolie.These controllers manage the busiest air space on the planet, the contorted, convoluted, cramped air near New York. They're competitive and strained and play the whole thing for laughs, even if they do realise how serious having a bad day at work might be.However It's unlikely Pushing Tin will make it onto the in flight movie list. The thought of a mob of adrenaline junkies competing with each other to see how close they can pack in the jumbo you might be sweating in, isn't likely to alleviate the fears of those in the nervous flyers club.But what is Pushing Tin really about? There are plenty of side issues in what is a fairly densely packed script but the penultimate conclusion of the film involves the two heavyweight tin pushers resolving their tensions with a particularly dangerous and reckless act to do with very large aircraft turbulence.These two blokes, being what they are, end up bruised and busted but quite a bit saner, having had, I would suggest, a demeaning experience calculated to get their little problems into perspective. Get your arse nearly blown off and it's damn hard to take anything else very seriously.But there must be more to Pushing Tin than whacky extreme psycho mumbo jumbo Jumbo Jet therapy if it's as good as I've been saying, and it's to do with personalities and close ups.Pushing Tin is absolutely stuffed with faces and in particular the visages of John Cusack, Billy Bob Thornton and Cate Blanchette. If you've ever wondered why so many of us spend so much time at the pictures then reflect on how interesting and complex good actors and their expressions can be if they are given (air) space.Pushing Tin pushes face, throwing in a good bit of titillating tension.

He proves the notion that you don't need words to speak volumes.  He and Cate Blanchett rise above the material they are given and produce multi-textured performances. You can see their character's history etched into every look, every expression, every move.Blanchett proves that Elizabeth was not a fluke, but the focused work of an incredible talent.  When her character is not onscreen in the off-duty segments, the film sags.  I am looking forward to The Talented Mr. Ripley to see how she confronts both tough material and talented co-performers again.Therein lies the weakness of Pushing Tin--the actors are given no help by either the script or each other.   Angelina Jolie has another character that cries and drinks (see Playing By Heart, etc.) but has little to work with and shows it.  Vicki Lewis, a fine character actress, is wasted here with a nothing character that could have been omitted entirely.  John Cusack, whom I had expected would show the humor and charm (human-ness) that lies below the surface of his mature-era characters in Con Air and Grosse Point Blank, instead gives a by-the-numbers pity me performance.  We get the point--he's envious, ready to enjoin a p***ing contest with Thornton--but it's Cusack's movie.  What does he want?Better yet, what does the movie want us to want?

Others fade away as quickly as they came. Pushing Tin is an example of the later; a film killed by its own meager attempts to quietly win over an audience. The movie introduces a first hand look into the world of air traffic controllers and the stressful and hectic lives they lead. Quality actors like John Cusack (Con Air, Grosse Point Blank) and Billy Bob Thornton (Sling Blade, A Simple Plan) get dragged along by a horrible script, which is derived from the article Somethings Got to Give by Darcy Frey. Actresses Cate Blanchett (Elizabeth) and Angelina Jolie (Hackers) also offer their talents, wasting them in the process. This film is neither overly entertaining nor revealing. The story subject itself, while interesting, cannot save the film in the end. Director Mike Newell fails to capture the moviegoer like he did with his previous works, Four Weddings and a Funeral, or the gripping Mafia flick, Donnie Brasco. Of course, in fairness, he doesn't have Al Pacino to work with either like he did in Donnie Brasco. But Newell fails to make good on the talent he does have. The movie revolves around a rivalry between Nick The Zone Falzone (Cusack) and the strange and crazy Russell Bell (Thornton). Nick is king of the New York's Terminal Radar Approach Control centre until Russell moves into town, having earned a reputation as a freak while working at various locations as an air traffic controller in the southern U.S.As the rumour goes, Russell once stood in the turbulence wake of a departing Boeing 747, which tossed him around like a rag doll. Apparently, he just wanted to see what it felt like. Russell seizes the challenge of pushing tin in the finite airspace above Kennedy, La Gaurdia and Newark airports, which handles up to 7,000 flights a day. Nick and Russell are pitted against each other from the moment they meet in this classic tale of one-upmanship. Whether it is competing to see who can lineup the most planes in a row on the radar screen at work, or shoot the most consecutive baskets at a friendly barbecue, Nick and Russell try to out do the other.The rivalry spills over into their personal lives and Nick ends up sleeping with Russell's stunning wife, Mary (Jolie). The incident systematically unravels Falzone's world reducing him to a ball of jangled-nerves, especially he finds out that Mary has told her husband about her extramarital activities. The disturbing part is that Russell calmly accepts the incident, to the amazement of Nick, but uses it as a psychological advantage in their game of one-upmanship. With competition between Nick and Russell spinning out of control, it is only a matter of time before winner, not the loser, could lose it all.

The comraderie at the helm is balanced with a shark-like betting on one another's success / failure behind the back of whom ever is down.The rest of the film is centered around the occurrences when an over-achieving, enigmatic controller and his strange wife upset the balance of the group status quo with their odd ways.Billy Bob Thornton as Russell Bell makes the picture, with his character inspiring a curious reaction to everyone around him. Just when we thought he couldn't come up with another bizarre portrayal of a loner (Sling Blade, U-Turn, A Simple Plan), he does so brilliantly.  His dark mystery, his motorcycle, and his wife cause everyone to get curious, especially the Falzones, played by John Cusack and Cate Blanchett.Cusack acts exactly like he does in every film, and this is one storyline where it's appropriate.  Nick Falzone is stirred not only to wonder about Russell Bell and to compete with him, but to become obsessed with him.  I found this to be the strength of the film - a relationship so layered and full of mixed emotions that it brings the viewer discomfort at times.The first act is passable; it does it's job of setting up the premise, albeit with extra baggage, like the scene of the controllers eating breakfast and asking two women to sit with them - what was that for, other than to show that Falzone has a wandering eye?  It was unnecessary.The second act is the best - the relationship between the Falzone couple is warm, sexy, and believable.  Which makes it all the more upsetting to see their relationship get knocked off kilter by the presence of Russell Bell, and his drunken bombshell wife. Several of the subplots and twists challenge the willing suspension of disbelief, and possibly they could have been pared down to make the second act move along at a pace more indicative of the controller's job.  The film keeps everything from the Falzone's perspective, putting us in the same position as they are, watching the Bells but never seeing what is behind their weird, mysterious curtain.The final thirty minutes are difficult to analyze; I have read that there was a different, darker ending, and this makes sense.  The film's ending is like a rabbit running in front of a car in the dark, darting this way and that, not sure where to go or how to get out of the way.  Even the production values changed here; in one scene by a river the exposure is poor and the filmic quality is noticably different.While the ending was not a thrill, it was not a disappointment, and overall my biggest criticism is that the film could have easily been 40 minutes shorter without losing anything. If anything, the filmmakers could have added a scene or two developing the bizarre Russell Bell even further.It's understandable that some viewers have been disappointed with this film; however, it is worth seeing in the theatre, in my opinion, and will be remembered for its chemistry between the main four characters, and for its successful portrayal of the industry.

The performances are fine- Thorton once again on a character tangent that shows his keen powers of interpretation; Cusack- has he EVER not delivered?; Blanchette- I totally zoned and forgot she was in this prior to sitting down in the theatre- showing an thorough ability to act American as a somewhat stereotyped, somewhat non-PC wife; Jolie as an eccentric matches Billy Bob's left-handed manner of tackling life yet ultimately displays a character that is too common in reality a person that apparently feels to be an individual she has to stick out with behavior that is at once both socially unacceptable and tired in its in-your-face attempt to shock. The film does manage to show the dedication to the task of controlling aircraft AND the requirement for a specific breed of men and women. Cusack and Billy Bob are these types in the film and pay homage over-all to a profession that I for one very much appreciate. The competitiveness is mostly fictitious- as portrayed in the film, it simply would not be tolerated in the real-world. I like the quirkyness of almost all of the characters, certainly the camaraderie of the controllers and the ability of the film to show, maybe unintentionally, that unlike the renown high-stress destructiveness of the air traffic control profession- they have the same problems all of us have, but probably arrive at them sooner. It's a fun, captivating, well-acted and written movie that ventures into a refreshing not too-tread upon area.

Do we even consider that the people who make sure the planes don't crash into each other are caffeine junkies, adulterers, and liars?  `Pushing Tin' takes us behind the scenes of an air traffic control station.  It's a very unique look at a world most know little about. Nick (John Cusack) is a hotshot controller working in America's biggest aircraft hub, New York.  Stuck in a boring marriage with his simple New Jersey wife (Cate Blanchett), Nick has become comfortable in the knowledge that no one is better at his job than him. In walks the mysterious Russell (Billy Bob Thornton), and quickly upstages Nick at work and in life. Fearing public humiliation, Nick wages a battle of wills with the reclusive Russell and in the crossfire ends up endangering his own tightly controlled world. Working from a script from Les Charles and Glen Charles (`Cheers'), Director Mike Newell does a fine job making sure the audience doesn't get lost in the shuffle.The opening of the film is fast and furious, and those not paying attention might be left behind. Stocked with the finest bouquet of actors, `Tin' is a wondrous example of the power of the actor. John Cusack gave a career nadir performance in 1997's `Grosse Pointe Blank'.  In that film, Cusack showed an amazing range that gave the character much more of an edge than many expected.  In `Tin', Cusack gives kind of a variation on that role, this time including heaps more self-loathing and arrogance to make the character surprisingly believable. Billy Bob's role seems to have been cut, or maybe not developed enough to make an impression.He's been terrific in the last year, but this film doesn't give him much to play with.  Blanchett is just wonderful. She makes her clichéd role as a typical Jersey housewife blossom with so many more colors that I doubt the script intended. `Pushing Tin' is a deeply nuanced movie.  Filled with great visuals and a crack sense of timing, the film - for the first 90 minutes - seems to have a chance at attaining a skilled portrait of a under appreciated side of life. When the script falls short, the film falls flat.  For some reason the drama seems to run out before the film ends.What that leaves us with is an unsatisfactory ending and a running time about 25 minutes too long.  Had they set aside that time to give Billy Bob Thornton's character a more stable backstory, the movie might have had a greater impact.As it stands, `Tin' is passable entertainment with flutters of brilliance.------- 7  "}{"Title":"takes off and flies high but has a rough landing","Date":"24 April 1999","Score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Drama, Romance","Review":"  just saw this one today and was very pleased.

A show about air traffic controllers was a fresh concept.I liked the way the movie illustrated the concept of group depravity how the supporting characters took bets on other co-workers, the gossiping and the cat-calling when a controller struggled.I took away points for some scenes that I thought weren't realistic and added nothing to the movie. For example, the scene with the 747 flying over the people on the runway is fake. The turbulence behind such a large plane could slam another jetliner on the ground. What do you think it would do to two people? In real life, the extensive conversations and singing on the radio while the area is loaded with air traffic would not be tolerated.However, the battle of egos between the two main characters makes up for whatever faults the movie has.

The high pressure world of the busiest air traffic control centre in the world where controllers make hundreds of descisions a day, holding the lives of thousands of people their hands. This creates a macho environment where even the women seem pumped with testosterone and the problems of coming down after work create endless possibilities for conflict and tension. Presented with this set up it would seem impossible to make a bad movie but somehow this is just what the writers of this film have done.Given such a wonderful situation on which to base a film there are a number of directions in which you could take it. Romantic comedy however is not the direction that immediatly springs to mind but unfortunately this is the way that the writers have chosen to go. King of the Hill John Cusack finds his perfect world rocked when the new kid on the block Billy Bob Thornton  turns up and upstages everything that he does. Wondering where you have heard this storyline before? Take your pick from about twenty films made in the last decade.( I mean come on, this was the dramatic premise of Toy Story). This leads to rivalry, silly contests and wife swapping but not much more. The dramatic possibilites of the job that they do and the internal tensions created by it are largely ignored or glossed over in favour of an unoriginal story of love and marriage. The script is littered with snappy dialogue and good one-liners, as you would expect from the writers of TV sit-coms such as Cheers, Taxi and MASH but what keeps TV viewers happy between ad breaks is not sufficient to carry a movie that is over two hours long. At times the film seems to be on the edge of complete farce but the director seems to realise this and steps back in time to save it from complete ridicule. However at the end the momentum is too much and it dives head first over the precipice into the most embarrassingly awful cringe inducing ending that has been seen in Hollywood for many years. What makes this film a double tragedy is the waste of acting talent on display here. John Cusack and Billy Bob Thornton are at the peak of their careers at the moment and have done some fantastic work recently. Ditto for Cate Blanchett whose acting talent is crimanally wasted here. The actors do a good job with the material and Mike Newell (Four Weddings and a Funeral, Donnie Brasco) keeps the action moving along at a good pace. The fault with this film lies with the writers who have failed to realise that stock story lines and witty one-liners, the mainstay of TV sitcom writing, do not cut the mustard in the world of movies. One further aside.I am not usually one who believes in blaming movies for stupid action in real life but is it really sensible to portray it as great fun to stand at the end of a runway and let Jet wash blow you away. Surely it can't be long before the first headlines saying that some idiot has died trying to perform this stunt.  "},{"Title":"Excellent start, drifts at the halfway point.

In the beginning of this 1999 movie it looked like one of those formula movies where the audience is exposed to another unique subculture, in this case air traffic controllers in New York, with all the usual suspects. You have the controller who is too nervous to do the job, reportedly it is very stressful, and the controllers who can do the job. There is a lot of horse play in the control room while hundreds of airline passengers' lives hang in the balance.The main character, John Cusack, is an immature, fast-talking, arrogant show-off, jerk whose identity seems to be dependent upon the delusion that the control room could not function without him. The other controllers humor him as long as he can do the job. His world starts to disintegrate due in great measure to Billy Bob Thornton's character coming on the scene and showing him up. Now he has to find out who he really is and what is really important to him. He has been living in his little delusional world for so long that he doesn't know how to deal with reality, but somehow he stumbles along. After seeking Billy Bob Thornton's help he engages in a daring but unbelievable stunt which helps him through his maturation crisis.There is apparently a happy ending.I've enjoyed several of John Cusack's and Billy Bob Thornton's movies and I thought this excellent cast could not help but turn out a good movie. However, I found myself getting impatient and bored with John Cusack's incompetent character as he kept going from one screw-up to another. In the end I didn't care if he made it or not. I kept watching because Billy Bob Thornton's character was interesting.I give this move a five out of ten.

Air traffic control is, statistically, the most stressful job in the world, and if you don't believe me; watch Keenan and Kel and see how highly strung Keenan's dad is! However, life is good for Nick; he has a beautiful wife (Cate Blanchett), his friend's think he's great. he's never made a mistake in his job and he holds the 'world record' for the most amount of balls through a basketball net in succession. Great. All that changes, however when the cold Russell Bell turns up at headquarters. Simply put; Bell is better than Falzone. He can hold a lit match for longer, he's better at basketball than Nick, he's a better singer and, worst of all, he has a younger, more beautiful wife (Angelina Jolie, later his wife in real life). Nick Falzone, is not a happy camper.Pushing Tin is a film about the male ego. The focus of the movie is always on the struggle between Nick and Russell. This is epitomised best in the hilarious sequence in which Nick is driving Russell to a restaurant. He's swerving about all over the road, weaving in and out of traffic, trying to impress Russell; only to look over to find him asleep. Pushing Tin features several moments of rib tickling humour, but also a lot of the more cerebral humour, which you'll either find hilarious or miss. As a comedy, this film works.John Cusack, Billy Bob Thornton, Angelina Jolie and Cate Blanchett; Pushing Tin features a great cast. They all perform their roles well, too. John Cusack in particular. He's a great actor, he's proved time and time again that he has the ability to carry a film by himself with his charm and good looks, and although he's not on his own here; it is one of his best performances. The characters in Pushing Tin are rather well done, especially as I was expecting this to be a John Cusack vehicle. Aside from being a comedy, the film is also a character study; one which studies the character of a male that has always had everything his way, when he's not getting his way anymore. The story, although comically overblown, does ring true to life of this type of situation. That's where the film draws most of it's humour from; it's the fact that the audience can relate to a lot of the stuff in this film that makes it funny.Overall, Pushing Tin is a very nice movie. It's finale is overblown, and the film is slightly overlong, but it's also a very funny character study that won't fail to generate a few laughs. I recommend Pushing Tin, it's one of the most underrated movies of 1999.

Cusack stars as Nick Falzone, a top-notch air-traffic controller who has everything going for him. He's got a seemingly great home life, great wife and is able to deal with the stress that comes with his high paying job. Enter Russell Bell, (Thornton), an equally impressive cool under pressure controller, who comes to work alongside Nick and the competition begins, at least in Nick's mind. It doesn't help matters either when Nick suddenly sleeps with Russell's wife, who then turns around and confesses all to Russell. Nick's entire life becomes a mess of confusion, fear and paranoia that Russell is out to get him. This movie misses the mark because we, the viewers, are not given any clear reasons as to what motivates these characters. We are supposed to believe that Nick sleeps with Russell's wife either out of pity for her, too much to drink or to prove something over Russell, possibly even all three. Russell's wife (Jolie) is lonely and her plant died, thus her supposed motivation behind the affair. Russell disappears a lot and we are never told why or where to. And although we aren't left with any mystery around whether Russell is really a good guy or staging Nick's paranoia, we are never given any hindsight into why he is the way he is. If you can get past the fact that these characters act completely on impulse regarding every decision they make in their lives, you might enjoy this film. I wanted more.

As for the rest of the movie, the only time it isn't boring is when it's confusing.First, as someone else mentioned, Nick Falzone (John Cusack's character) was initially interesting and likable, but then degenerates not only morally but also logically - too much time was spent on the romantic interlude that had no romance, and the competition between Falzone and Bell (Thornton's character) in which Bell is a non-competitor (he just does his thing while Falzone keeps throwing himself against the image he has of Bell). I really like John Cusack, but the character requirements of likable competence to paranoia to incompetence to inexplicable resolution were too much for even this talented actor... somewhere around the bomb scene, Falzone lost all my sympathy and I was hoping he'd just disappear and see more of Russell Bell.Thornton did what he could with Bell, who was relatively undeveloped. Bell was also confusing in at least one respect supposedly he is ripe for an aluminum shower because he is overly-competitive at getting all the planes in and supposedly less aware than Falzone of the people in the planes, and yet he is the one who literally steps outside the control room and makes contact with the lost aircraft in a personal way - in addition to his devotion to reality evidenced by his desire to experience wake turbulence personally. He could have provided much more material for the film, as well as a much clearer lesson to Falzone (and the viewers).Angelina Jolie's character (Mary Bell) was undeniably weird, but the acting was even weirder. The transition between emotions appeared to be less a transformation and more like a scene change... I suppose the drinking factor could believably account for the heavy-lidded zombie-like movements and speech, but the camera always seemed to linger a little too long on everything she did - I suppose that was for the sexuality factor, but it really only served to make the acting look more scripted and uncomfortable.Cate Blanchett did OK in the role of Connie Falzone. However, her emotional response to Nick with his admission, while good at first,  also ended up confusing. It isn't clear whether her claim of an affair with Russell was a lie to just even things up (in which case we should have seen a resolution), or if it was the truth (in which case later actions and resolutions make little sense).Speaking of resolutions, every drama has to have one but here we have the single-competitor competition resolved with either a)throwing yourself in cold water or b)getting thrown around by a big wind. I guess it may have been something spiritual but that was never brought out. Additionally, the resolution of Falzone's marital problems with a 2-minute serenade over the ATC channel was pretty lame, for several reasons it is 1)illegal and would not be permitted 2)illogical because all the other aircraft would now be unable to talk to ATC and 3)impossible because aircraft radios cannot transmit and receive on one frequency at the same time. Plenty of movies do impossible or illogical things, but this movie started out so realistically showing the critical and frenetic pace of ATC, why did they throw away that concept at the end? There are other realistic ways it could have been ended... I can think of one - what if the spiritual aspects of Bell's message to Falzone had been developed a bit more, and then play a role in Falzone's recovery from his breakdown - and if you want schmaltzy romantic resolution at the end, have his wife's plane have an emergency where he is now able to thread the needle as Bell did earlier, then race to the airport to meet her..Oh well, I guess this movie was never meant to be on the scale of a Die Hard (not Die Hard 2 which was just about as bad as this one)... overall, 5 out of 10, and only that high because the ATC scenes were interesting.

The film continues in a group vein, which is immensely wearing, as we watch a bunch of 30-somethings bond with their own coded language and gestures. Eventually, though, the film broadens out, becomes more tolerably conventional, as we are introduced to families, adultery, leisure time, Italian restaurants, even wide rugged Colorado spaces - ironically, the film also narrows its focus, as it analyses the inexplicable mythical stand-off between its two leads.It is remarkable that something as phoney in conception as this can yield some genuine truths.  The initial emphasis on the group and male cameraderie invoke Altman and Hawks, but Newell doesn't follow through (two other films it reminded me of, in the controllers' singular speed info-reading, were Herzog's HOW MUCH WOOD CAN A WOODCHUCK CHUCK and STROZZEK, two bitter fables about American capitalism)The setting up of the initial conflict is too abrupt (some genius annoying you with his motorbike does not justify a life-destroying obsession, although the resulting, immature coffee-spilling overturn is very funny), and the endless reruns of crises in American masculinity, close, as ever, to homoeroticism, is rather wearisome, just as macho as Arnie, but with smarter words.We are warned in a comic sequence involving schoolkids not to read too much into the metaphor (or is it simile?) of the ivory air-control tower, but it seems less about saving lives than the creation of a mythic space in which the central anxieties are played out.  The struggle in the plane cockpit is just about plausible as a sign of Nick's mental breakdown, but the contrivance of the bomb takes the film out of character observation into the improbably fantastic, without the latter really becoming an extension of the former.  The whole last third is fairly underwhelming anyway, probably because a film that is fuelled by John Cusack's mental and verbal agility must slow down when he does; the use of wives as extensions of the masculine game, though, seems less forgivable.In spite of all these worries, I found PUSHING TIN a most enjoyable film. The characterisations are superb, and the initial irritations are revealed to be part of the protective armour these alienated characters wear. Because we believe (more or less) in the central quartet so strongly, in spite of the improbabilities of their relationships, the sadistic plot-twists growing out of character become exhilirating, as we squirm with the exquisite surprise of 'you can't!' inevitability.The delineation of two madnesses, one hyperactively verbal, the other self-effacingly passive, allows for some great comic stand-offs; the film laughs at their immaturity while making it central to its momentum. Again, after some bogus attempts at atmosphere, the dialogue spits comic truth all over the place, so loose and true it might almost have been improvised, yet so tight and structured it could only have been written by craftsmen. Even icky cheerslike gestures are regularly deflated, undermining the cosier impulses.Mike Newell is no Alexsei Balabanov, but he is adept at the jarring comic detail and the intricacies of close-knit groups threatened by outsiders, while there are a couple of excellent flourishes, such as our first sight of Nick out of the tower alone, speeding down the highway, anticipated by the whoosh of an aerial shot, a brilliantly ironic, explanatory movement.Of course, for this kind of character- and dialogue-driven film to work, the acting must be spot on.  Billy Bob Thornton reveals all the near-psychotic wearing down of life in a resigned smile, a crazed peace; but this is Cusack's film, as initially irritating and eventually winning as ever; his nervy logorrhea and preposterous macho gestures achieving a charming grace. I was going to take my first terrified flight this summer.  Not now.

The profession can be hard to make watchable, but with the cast here I had my hopes up.  The story is based on vignettes gleaned by a writer visiting the NY terminal radar control center in 1995-96 timeframe.  His story was written to make the reader think every sensational event recalled from the past two decades occurred in a weekend.  Fortunately, the movie didn't dwell on ALL the inane material, but the writers spent more time on the individual scenes than the storyline.Don't go to this movie to learn how air traffic controllers live - that was likely the scene in the 70's and early 80's, but I think things are more sober and settled today.  Don't get me wrong, the big facilities do move metal, and the best are truly wired for sound like the characters in this movie.  Penalties for drinking have dampened the party culture over the years.  Today, the average controller is more of a cross between the two characters in this film than on either edge.  Yes, we've got our share of family problems, and a surprising number of controllers couples.  Even a couple of rearranged couples...Controllers do almost universely share the movie controllers' cynical disdain for management and government, leading to many of the same type of snafus witnessed on the show.  They're also generally a close-knit group that's more supportive of one another than depicted in the film.Enough about the realism.   The acting is competent, but wasted.

I'm sure it will solve all my problems! While the scene is admittedly funny, Pushing Tin actually expects us to believe that this act provides Nick (John Cusack) with insight that will help him solve the troubles he has got himself into. As if! Perhaps I could accept this act of infantility if the entire movie worked at this comic level, but it doesn't. At one level the film is a serious drama, and at another level, it sinks to complete absurdity.At first Pushing Tin had me. The first scenes with the air traffic controllers at work were intense and had me thinking back to all the times that I have flown on planes and wondering just how close other planes have been. John Cusack is great in these scenes uttering dialogue so quickly that it seems as though he's an auctioneer. However I almost wonder how the pilots are able to understand him. I was also interested in the initial conversations that take place outside the control room in places like coffee shops and pool halls.Air traffic control is a high stress profession and the anxious atmosphere is caught quite well in the control room. Its no wonder the controllers who work there are cynical and have to resort to seemingly juvenile activities to keep themselves detached. They drink and party a lot, and there are a number of scenes showing Nick driving his car wrecklessly. At first, there are signs of hope that what we are going to see is a gripping film about the chaotic lives of air traffic controllers, but nothing is further from the truth.Russel (Billy Bob Thornton) soon enters into the picture. His character is quite opposite from that of Nick's. Russel is more relaxed and willing to pile planes close together in order to perform his job more efficiently. Nick refers to him as a loose cannon. Film-makers seem to love pitting opposites against one another.Russel's character is seriously under drawn. Where does he come from? What aspects make up his detached and strange personality? No attempts are made to answer these questions We are given the names of a few places where he has been an air-traffic controller and that is all. He is a mysterious entity that seems to pop into the film from nowhere.One night while Nick is in the supermarket, he runs into Russel's wife Mary (Angelina Jolie) whose character we also wonder about, but we are never given any insight. She is in tears and naturally Nick wants to comfort her. He takes her out to dinner at the restaurant that he and his wife Connie (Cate Blanchett) usually go to. From here on in, the story fills itself with absurdities beyond belief and plot holes big enough to drive a truck through them. The whole movie goes down hill so quickly that there should be a plane crash at some point just to show that the film has hit rock bottom.It isn't long before Nick realizes that his life is hell. He can't even concentrate on work. Who does he turn to? None other than Russel who he some how finds fishing in Colorado. Jump in the river, Russel commands. Do you really want to solve your problems, let's go, Russel says. You'll wish that you jumped in the river. From here the film works its way into the most absurd ending I have ever seen. Once I realized how everything was going to turn out, I just wanted to get up and walk out, and this was only about five minutes before the credits started rolling. Rarely do films ever anger me, but this ending was just so ludicrous, I could not help myself.*1/2 out of **** "},{"Title":"What a waste of talent","Date":"25 April 1999","Score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Drama, Romance","Review":"  I love John Cusack and Billy Bob Thornton, but this movie was nothing but a waste of talent.

It seems she was just abruptly taken out as if they decided midway through filming they didn't want to write anything more for her. So don't be fooled by her fourth-billing status as I was; she's only in about two-fifths of the movie.Surprisingly, the film does seem to redeem itself a bit in the end, but you're still left with the sour after-taste in your mouth that keeps the film from feeling resolved.VERDICT An enjoyable film with the character that seems to be lacking from most movies made in the past decade. The twist could've been handled better and the momentum is lost somewhere in the middle, but still a highly watchable movie. Recommended to all John Cusack fans or anyone looking for a break in the stale mold of recent comedy-dramas.6.5 out of 10.0 "},{"Title":"WHERE'S THE CRASHES ??","Date":"16 July 2001","Score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Drama, Romance","Review":"  Ultimately a film about air traffic controllers needs a mid-air collision to sustain interest. Computer generated near-misses are no substitute. Therefore you're left with a film that although well acted, drags on and doesn't deserve 120 minutes of your time. What's next a 3 hour epic about traffic wardens?Thornton and Cusack are always worth a watch, but the script was predictable after the first 5 minutes. Newell did male relationships a lot better in Donnie Brasco, and I'd recommend that over this on a wet Saturday afternoon.

There are several reasons why I hate this film there is no plot, no humor among the actors and extremely disjointed not to mention very slow. It is so slow that I can go out to get fast food, eat, come back and not miss a thing. In fact, the best thing I can say about this film is that they survived this film and are going to be in better films. Pushing Tin is nothing more than good talent gone by the waste side.

Hey, it pays the bills.Other than that, this film had some good insights to the pressure of Air Traffic Control as a career, and I must admit looking up with a hint of hesitation on the way home - I live on the flight path for Heathrow.

It belongs to an emerging genre of movies that have the feel of short stories (the kind that build towards small human moments when the ordinary becomes strange or absurd and we're suddenly given insight into what's been unfolding in the subtext). These kinds of movies don't rely on formulas and so there are always plenty of viewers in search for a plot who don't really get it, but this is definitely one of the more amusing and successful ones to come out this year. Unfortunately, the title is a real turn off. It's a mystery to me why this movie didn't run longer because I'm sure it would have caught on. The performances were all excellent, the story was totally unique, the writing was very original and compelling, and it was extremely funny (everyone in my theater was laughing the entire time). The metaphors in the movie really worked and I left it excited enough to want to read the treatment, to wake up thinking about it, and to try to make at least some effort to defend it here.

There are so many smart and funny details that you need to watch it twice to catch them all.  As you might expect, most of the reviewers were too analytical. Just stop thinking ... and enjoy!

This movie revoles around a air traffic controller Nick Falzone (Cusack), who is the best air traffic controller in long Island- until Russel Bell (Thornton) comes along, and steals Nick's rep from him. Cate Blanchett stars as John's wife and Angelina stars as Billy Bob's wife... any suprised that later in real life these two got married? All Of the characters are intersting in this movie, but, once again, Angelina Jolie steals the show for me.  This is a high-flying comedy, but i tell you it's not that great. *** out of ***** "},{"Title":"Excellent Film","Date":"27 April 1999","Score":"0 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Drama, Romance","Review":"  I loved this film.  I'm a huge fan of John Cusack and Angelina Jolie.  This film shows something not seen before, the hectic world of air traffic controllers.  I'm a reluctant flyer and I don't think I'll ever fly after seeing this film.  Cusack does what he does best, playing a totally psychotic character. Angelina Jolie plays the most interesting, if most unused, character.  I love that she cries over the death of her favorite plant.  I would watch anything she does, no matter what.  She is one of the finest actors working in film today.  The film was hilarious and touching all at once.

I had seen maybe one trailer and even then I didn't pay much attention to it.Billy Bob Thornton and John Cusack had surprising chemistry despite their two completely different acting styles.  Both did excellent jobs in the roles they were given.Worth the price of admission to the theatre.
