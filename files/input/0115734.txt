But man was he great in this movie. I mean it was such a good performance. This movie is director Wes Anderson's (Rushmore, The Royal Tenenbaums, The Life Aquatic) feature directorial debut. It's about a group of misfit friends that decide to take up a life of crime. The group includes Anthony (Luke Wilson) just got out of the nut house and is searching for himself. Dignan (Owen Wilson, co-wrote the movie with Anderson) is the confident but bumbling ringleader who wants to be notorious but doesn't know how to execute a plan to save his life. And Bob (Robert Musgrave) the driver/look out who just wants a little recognition. The movie follows their misadventures of them robbing a bookstore, going on the lamb, Anthony falling in love with a Motel maid who instills joy back in his life, and Dignan's 'big score' that involves his former employer. The subtle humor and deliveries by the actors make the movie stand out in it's own little version comedy. The characters are losers, but lovable. You can't help but cheer them on even though what they do is illegal. I highly recommend this cool little film. It's an excellent introduction into the wonderful films of Wes Anderson.RATING **** out of **** "},{"Title":"debut full of charm from the experts in subtle comedy","Date":"1 January 2005","Score":"41 out of 50 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Crime, Drama","Review":" While Bottle Rocket is certainly best categorised as comedy this might mislead those expecting the typical composition of one-liners, facetious mocking and exaggerated situational comic of mainstream Hollywood productions.Instead the humour derives from the quirky, yet lovable characters, their perspective on life and approach in dealing with the challenges of society.The quiet matter-of-fact absurdity present throughout the film will evoke a constant smile rather than burst-out-laughter. This is typical of all Wilson/Anderson collaborations (Rushmore, The Royal Tenebaums) where strong characterisation enables the viewer to develop understanding and affection for the protagonists as the story slowly unravels. In Bottle Rocket this is supported by strong performances, especially that of Owen Wilson, who proves his actor potential in an atypical role.Though not flawless, (there is a lack of narrative urgency at times), this movie leaves the viewer ultimately entertained and charmed.

This portrait of small-time  criminal is made masterful by the performances of Owen C. Wilson and Luke  Wilson. Owen's Dignan dreams of glory as an outlaw are almost noble. He may  have his inadequacies, but at least he is determined. While Luke's Anthony  lacks that kind of determination, what he has is at least a sense of his  inadequacies that Dignan lacks. But, while these two are never meant for  great things, they can still achieve all their dreams if they just keep  them small. Dignan is content with a life of small robberies. What he  maintains is great pride for that. And Anthony find happiness in love from  an unlikely woman. To find romance with the woman he does is much too  quirky to have ever happened in a Hollywood movie. Yet this film plays it  perfectly. And so, what makes this film so unique is that it is not so self -involved and moody like most independent films can be. And while it has a  bright appeal, it is more eccentric than campy like most mainstream  comedies can be. This is truly a unique comedy and I get the feeling that  one day, the lines of hipness will be drawn between who has seen this movie  and who hasn't.

Co-written by then credited Owen C. Wilson, the screenplay is very intelligent and shows how the screen writing duo (Wes Anderson and Owen Wilson) has evolved. Starring the Wilson brothers, Owen and Luke Wilson, this small-budget comedy has what most large budget comedies lack, a perfect mix of drama and comedy. The film, about two friends that both were patients at a mental ward, portrays how innocent fun can sometimes hurt people. Rocket never becomes over-dramatic or slapstick in its comedy. It is clear that Anderson was experimenting with his style, and would not perfect it until his next film, Rushmore. The characters are clearly dysfunctional and like to take unnecessary risks at their own expense to make the script move along. This is not a fault in the script, but a blessing as this keeps the comedy and serious moments perfectly balanced. The cinematography is sometimes amateur with its unnecessary close-ups and wide angle panning. The soundtrack, done by Mark Mothersbaugh is excellent and just proves why he has worked an all of the subsequent films with Anderson. It seems Anderson and Wilson have an enormous talent when writing dialog for unusual, anomalous characters. This film is a testament to the fact that a good script, and a working knowledge of film work can create an original and enjoyable film.

There's an air about them that's so wonderful and I always feel really great after I've watched them. When I tried to explain my friend said, a bit like the Big Lebowski? and I think that's the closest you can come to describing Bottle Rocket and Wes Anderson movies as a whole they're that sort of brand of movie.Bottle Rocket is the story of three guys who live in the suburbs who are trying to become criminals and not making a very good job of it. The film starts with Anthony (Luke Wilson) coming out of a voluntary rehab type place and instantly joining his friend Dignan in his very poor attempts to become some sort of criminal. They are joined by their friend Bob, because he has a car, and start by robbing a library. The film really emerges from that moment and takes you on this up beat, weird (but wonderful) adventure.Owen and Luke Wilson are really good together, with Owen Wilson probably stealing the show as the completely useless but very endearing Dignan. Bob, played by Robert Musgrave, is also excellent in his role as the lovable loser. The soundtrack is perfect, everything comes and goes at exactly the right moment. This was probably one of the funniest films i've seen in a while too. If you like the Big Lebowski you will love this film (my favourite is probably Anthony wake up, Bob's stolen his car). It also feels a lot longer than it is and whilst that's usually bad, in this case it was fantastic. At 30 minutes I looked to see how long I'd been watching it for and was amazed at how engrossed I was but also how much happens but yet the film manages to feel really slow and relaxed.Though I've said Dignan was endearing I guess the movie as a whole is endearing, its such a lovely film, I really don't see how you couldn't like it. Some how this just misses out on being a real classic on a level with Big Lebowski, maybe its because not as many people have seen it or something, either way its definitely in my top ten or top five or something. A must see, go and watch it!

It bears all of the hallmarks of a Wes Anderson film (quirky characters, dry humor, precise and orchestrated cinematography, and a story about finding something beautiful in the flaws of the main characters, especially Dignan (Owen Wilson).The film has a simple story, three friends attempting to commit a robbery and go on the run, but like Wes Anderson movies it is not straightforward. The movie is not about the heist, rather the relationships between the main characters and their flaws. The best of which is Owen Wilson's 75 year plan he created for himself and Luke Wilson's character, describing when they would get married, etc.Dignan's 75 year plan and his heist plan are themes Wes Anderson carries throughout his movies. A main character is always trying to accomplish something well beyond their means and capacity (i.e. Bill Murray in Life Aquatic, Max in Rushmore, Owen Wilson in Darjeeling). They are always planning and scheming something greater than they can obviously achieve. This movie blends humor, and drama very well. It reminds me of Fargo with its dry and occasionally dark humor. The film ends as a tragedy (the tragedy of Dignan), which makes us feel bad for him. But you almost feel like he will be okay. His personality makes this bad turn of fortune not seem so bad. Bottle Rocket is one of Anderson's better movies and if you enjoy any and all of his later flicks then check this one out.

And what's best about it is that it never really seems to get old. They make their movies in such a way, that there really isn't a year or exact date or place that their movies take place in.

It immediately engages its audience in the ridiculous story of Dignan (Owen Wilson) and Anthony (Luke Wilson), two friends that aren't any good at being criminals - although they aspire to be. They work alongside their friend Bob Mapplethorpe (Robert Musgrave) or rather trick him into helping them due to the fact that he can finance their operations.What's so interesting about this film is the true heart that started in the script and then continued to shine through with the actors' performances. The characters were developed deeply enough for the audience to truly get a sense of who they were, what they wanted, and where they were going. Although the film tells the story of a group of wannabe thieves, it becomes clear that the reason why they are no good at pulling off these crimes is simply because of the fact that they are actually really nice guys, incapable of actually hurting anyone.The most remarkable aspect of the film would have to be in the brilliant performances featured throughout. Owen Wilson truly shines as Dignan, the group's leader - desperate to pull off at least one fantastic heist. He is hot-tempered, controlling, and he often lets his emotions get the best of him. Although he may screw up a lot, he is always quick to apologize. At the end of the film when he is sentenced to serve time, he claims to have no hard feelings showing a real growth in his character. Another standout performance came from Luke Wilson as Dignan's best friend Anthony. It's obvious that Anthony doesn't want to be a criminal, and that he simply participates because he doesn't want to make Dignan unhappy. After he falls in love with one of the maids at a motel they stay at, he realizes he can't work with Dignan anymore. Wilson's performance was outstanding - he was really able to convey both his character's indifferent side, and also being torn between love and friendship.Bottle Rocket was an outstanding debut achievement for director Wes Anderson, marking the beginning of a series of stunning films full of character driven scripts, great music, and aesthetically pleasing visuals.

As usual, Anderson presents flawed characters for whom you will feel compassion. But this comedy does not attempt to make you cry. Filled with dry humor, this script was the first of three to have been co-written by Owen Wilson and Wes Anderson. If you are in the camp that prefers Rushmore and Royal Tenenbaums, you will find that this script feels more like those films than Anderson's more recent work.Although this movie has a smaller budget than Anderson's other films, the director is able to put together a fun film. Anderson compiles one of his great soundtracks despite being unable to afford royalty-heavy songs.Perhaps not yet confident enough to take risks, Anderson does not engage in the visual experimentation found in his other films. Although you might miss the liberal use of vivid colors found in all other Anderson films, I think the fantastic sets and props (such as the submarine or the helicopter in Life Aquatic) are best left out of this simpler, more realistic film.

Doesn't need to be; for Wes Anderson's first film he takes partly (in theory) a cue from Michael Cimino's Thunderbolt and Lightfoot. There too were the real oddball outsider characters, looking for a leg up but not with the same kind of zeal of a real hard-bitten criminal or neo-noir. In Bottle Rocket there's an ex-volunteer at an insane asylum and a guy who works for a landscaping company and the two are thick as thieves- only they're not good at actually being thieves, with one or two moments of exception. And yet Anderson doesn't mine for the easy parts for comic effect. His sense of humor is in the small things, little character traits or a moment that pops out.It may depend on how one sees the characters, and how much one is a fan of the Wilson brothers, Luke and Owen. But what Anderson does capture is that innocent feeling of being unsure of life and the things that make friendships kind of awkward at times. The three criminals, played by Anthony, Dignan and Bob bicker and converse and do whatever like normal folk, not real gangsters like, say, Mr Henry (James Caan), but they aspire to that, and Dignan gets the closest. Meanwhile, on the lam from a robbery of a bookstore, Anthony falls for a Peruvian housemaid and Bob has his own worries with his backyard pot growth. Their appeal, really, is in how the interactions are based around a solid theme of loyalty and friendship, and the film-making takes it to another level.It's hard to say if I found this a really great comedy- there's a few big laughs, one with a hilarious botch during a climactic robbery with a shot at someone unexpected, and little ones like a PB&J just lifted off the ground or a bad encounter at a country club- but it's an unusually amazing heist-character-drama. Well, drama of sorts; it's the Wes Anderson style already in full mode, and it's exhilarating to watch him make 90 minutes feel a lot fuller, a lot more alive than most at such a running time. I also liked the Wilson brothers, with the both of them in their breakout roles completely on top with their subtle, zany and quietly crazy roles. Loved the music, the cinematography, but most of all the emphasis on character over plot. In heist movies, or just young/lost-20-something generation movies, it's rarely this good.

After all they do were almost like brothers, they were a team, a team that never accomplished anything really big but that at least became a true team. Not very long time ago I watched the Woody Allen film Take the Money and Run and by watching Bottle Rocket I remembered that Allen film. So they are a team here and Dignan leader and the one with the ideas, with the plans, he has all planned for like the next fifty years! But once you see him in action well you will remember Woody Allen in Take the Money and Run, basically Dignan, during the heist to a bookstore, ends talking to the manger of the bookstore with a lot of respect! But well the three now are fugitives, both Dignan and Anthony and Bob (the only one who has a car) but is not yet a team, basically one will be in love, the other will be worry because of a family situation and the other is the only one who still is in the team. This film has what is probably the very best performance of Owen Wilson, he is usually very funny but here he is simply superb. He plays a very strange and very memorable character, Dignan is more or less like a big kid when is time for his plans and stuff, he is a likable character since the very first scene of the film, sometimes he takes himself very seriously, Grace (Anthony's little sister) defines Dignan very well I do like Dignan but he's a liar. At one point these two brothers will take different roads for whatever reasons, the fact is that Anthony will have a complete change in his life. We meet Anthony during his last day at a mental hospital, he was there because he wanted to be there, we know that is certainly a difficult time for him, he is unhappy but this will change. I think the scene that sort of defines Anthony is when he is together with Inez (Lumi Cavazos), the housekeeper of the hotel that they were staying in, in the laundry room, he is just fascinated feeling something that certainly was unexpected. So the team is now the least important thing for Anthony and when he returns to home he starts a new productive routine and with that he has no time to think if Inez love him or not or in anything from the past. Dignan is back in Anthony's life, certainly another plan but is Anthony in? he knows he has now something more but again is Dignan, a great scene, Anthony sees sort of a resume of how is Dignan's life, he is in and Bob too. Very hilarious but certainly also sad, the last part of the film is that as well as the entire film. Each member of the team ended very well with the others but only each member of the original team, the plan turned to be a mess, Dignan ended in jail with a sentence of 2 years (that scene in which Dignan tries to escape but finally is arrested by the police is simply a superb one, the music was great, one of my favourites scenes) Bob ended without most of his things but they ended as a real team, after all they're not really criminals but everybody's got to have a dream. Watch this one, probably my favourite Anderson film (up there with The Royal Tenenbaums) and hell it has James Cann (as a clever swine!).PD recently I visited Roger Ebert's website and in the main page there is part of his review for the film Revolutionary Road and he wrote at the beginning the John Lennon phrase LIFE IS WHAT HAPPENS TO YOU WHILE YOU'RE BUSY MAKING OTHER PLANS. I liked that phrase and I thought was right for this film. Anyway, Ebert gave to Bottle Rocket only 2 stars (and to Rushmore, the other Anderson film that for me gets a 10, only 2 and half stars) while for Martin Scorsese Bottle Rocket was the number 7 of his best films of the 1990's list from ROGER EBERT & THE MOVIES show #1426.

We have seen them countless times in many films. The film gives you sweet comedy which is sure to tickle your bone. The comedy is situational. Nothing is forced in terms of plot or actions by the characters. It is just the way things are happening to them which are shown happening very naturally. I have come across a number of comedy types and still I find this type involving silly characters who look normal, act natural and desperate to achieve something but somehow things never work for them. They never understand that also.The plot of the film revolves around three main characters, two of whom are just out from a mental hospital (but cured) and plan to attempt several robberies. The characters are natural, trying their best to do live life properly. Their plans are not hard core and neither is the difficulty too much.

I have to say, it is a pretty good start for all three men.It is a very entertaining film in and of itself, but Anderson fans should particularly enjoy seeing where he got his start. It's got many of the earmarks of the greatness that was to come fantastic writing and dialogue, a number of very memorable character, and a well chosen soundtrack. As I mentioned earlier, this is also the first film Luke and Owen Wilson made and both manage quite good performances. Owen plays Dignan, a man trying to start up a heist team. He is equally enthusiastic and naive but seems to have good intentions. Luke plays Dignan's often reluctant partner in crime who is love stuck by the housekeeper at the motel they stay at. Luke has always been my favorite of the Wilson brothers, but I have to say Owen steals the show in Bottle Rocket. He has many great one liners that he delivers with impeccable comic timing. Two other actors worth noting are Andrew Wilson and James Caan. Andrew Wilson, who plays Future Man, is one of the lesser known Wilson brothers. I can't remember the story of how Anderson got an actor of James Caan's caliber to co-star in his debut film.

I actually had to record this to watch it because I wasn't available for TV at the time. Now, I'm happy that I did so. I love this film! I don't know why this tanked so badly at the box office. If you think about it as you watch it, it's very interesting. Of course, many people at the time had probably only heard the names of the actors in the film for the first time, with the exception of James Caan, so it may not have been a star attractor. Maybe that explains it? All I know is that I wanted to watch this again after the first view because it was that good.Dignan, played by Owen Wilson, is now a film icon for me. His name is not only the coolest name ever, but it alone spells out his dignity, passion, and aggressive will to hang on whatever he can get. Even though Anthony (Luke Wilson) makes a good main character, the film focuses on Dignan, for his actions motivate the other characters and keep the film going. Wilson's performance of this character was probably at his best and it is one of those very rare acts where the actor doesn't become the character, but actually is the character.As I said, it is the simplest complex films I've ever watched because the scenes are rather mellow and easy, not emotional and touching like most friendship comedy-drama films, but they still leave the audience with feelings. That's why the script is brilliant. It spares intensity from the screen and lets the audience find it for each person itself. It's very hard to achieve that, but Wes Anderson and Wilson do so.Each character is so well formed. Like Anderson's other movie, The Royal Tenenbaums, you can see the essence of each character just from their appearance, voice, and movement. Only for this one, I cannot quite describe how. The only way to know what I'm talking about is to actually see these characters for yourself.Almost like a Shakespearean play, every character shown plays a role. Even those who seem minor have an important part, so their appearances aren't wasted. An example is Grace (Shea Fowler), Anthony's caring but cynical kid sister who is deeply disappointed at her brother's chosen destination in life. At first, Anthony's happy to see her, to see that someone understands and knows him like the person he really is. But he sees that, over time, Grace has become unlike that, that her childish deceit has come in the way. She becomes a hard spot in Anthony's life and mind, which becomes resolved for a time by Inez (Lumi Cavalos).This may be a mere cult hit now, but I have a feeling that it will become something bigger in the future. It's become one of my favorite films and it has a special place in my mind. It's a landmark in comedy-drama and much more. Well done, Anderson.

Naturally, things don't go exactly as planned, with comically disastrous results for all concerned.Acclaimed indie director Wes Anderson's debut feature is one of those subtle little comic beauties that doesn't really seem like much as you watch it, but gets funnier and more resonant when you reflect on it after seeing it. It has its own uniquely sweet and eccentric low-key charm, a certain offhanded grace and understated style that's both endearing and enjoyable in comparable measure. The smart and astute script by Anderson and Wilson shows a genuine warmth and affinity for this personable trio of lovable slacker losers with big time ambitions and no actual ability to effectively realize said ambitions. Standard crime film conventions are cleverly turned on their ear. For example, our blundering and constantly bickering threesome resort to crime not out of necessity, but out of misguided desire and sheer desperation; they're just trying to alleviate the numbing tedium of their drab, safe and comfortable suburbanite existences. The robbery sequences are simply sidesplitting, with our boys proving beyond a reasonable doubt that they just aren't ideal and suitable candidates for a life of crime (the book store caper is absolutely priceless). Better still, both Wilson brothers and Musgrove are terrific in the leads, with superb support from Lumi Cavazos as a nice and pretty Mexican motel maid Anthony falls in love with, Andrew Wilson as Bob's browbeating tool of a brother Future Man, and especially James Caan as hearty, jovial local crime boss Mr. Henry. Mark Mothersbaugh's breezy score and Bob Yeoman's bright, fluid, dynamic and picturesque cinematography are both on the money excellent. The leisurely pacing takes a little getting used to, but once you get into the film's quirky groove the movie overall proves to be a real fresh, funny and above all inspired and original treat.

I'm glad I rented it. It turned out to my one of my favorite movies. Bottle Rocket starts as Anthony Adams( Luke Wilson) is being released from an asylum for exhaustion. Anthony meets up with his friends Dignan, an enthusiastic wannabe criminal( played by co-writer Owen Wilson), and rich, but depressed Bob Mapplethorpe( Robert Musgrave). Their first big robbery is at a bookstore, which is very funny because Dignan politely robs the store( Uh, do you have any bigger bags for atlasas and dictionaries, uh, sir?). This leads to the three hiding out at a hotel where Anthony falls in love with a maid( Lumi Cavazos), who can't speak English. I'm not going to give away any more of the plot, because I feel I gave away too much already. Now I'm going to say why Bottle Rocket is a great film It's original, funny( especially in the scenes involving Kumar Pallana as a senile safecracker), and with great performances by Owen Wilson, Luke Wilson, and another Wilson brother, Andrew, as Bob's bullying big brother. James Caan also gives a very good small performance. Bottle Rocket also have some great music in it, including a score by Mark Mothersbaugh, and the movie songs include two of my favorites The Rolling Stone's 2000 Man and The Proclaimer's Over and Done With.

With films such as THE LIFE AQUATIC WITH STEVE ZISSOU, THE ROYAL TENENBAUMS, and RUSHMORE in his repertoire, I feel the quirky title to be appropriate. Best known for Rushmore (1998), Anderson's films have a unique edge to them. Definitely not in-your-face comedy, their impact is much dryer and subtler (I remember the nude gal in The Life Aquatic just being there because some nudity was needed. And I remember Bill Murray driving back and forth over his enemy's bicycle in Rushmore then placing it back in its bike rack and how I knew this would influence the battle yet-to-come).I'd never heard of BOTTLE ROCKET until somebody pointed it out to me. Having enjoyed Rushmore tremendously, it came highly recommended. And after watching it, I can see why.This is early Anderson, and a film that helped launch his inimitable movie style. Released in 1996 and starring the newly found Wilson brothers (Luke and Owen), it goes to show that Anderson knew how to pick a good script and good actors to round out a chuckle-fest.Luke Wilson (MY SUPER EX-GIRLFRIEND) is no stranger to Anderson films now, having been given the lead role here and later strong supporting roles in The Royal Tenenbaums and Rushmore, Luke can celebrate his strong Anderson film trifecta and proudly point back to his roots in this film. Brother Owen (CARS) is one up on Luke in that he has performed in all of those, plus The Life Aquatic.Mental health issues abound for Anthony (Luke Wilson) and his buddy Dignan (Owen). In fact, Anthony has just been released from a voluntary psychiatric facility where he was resting after a nervous breakdown. Waiting for him in the bushes (literally) is Dignan, who believes Anthony is escaping from the psych ward instead via his own free will.The two quickly go back to their old ways. They decide to return to a life of petty thieving and even do dry-runs by robbing Anthony's family's home in order to see if they still have their robbing edge. They also decide to take on the strangest heists (from meat packing plants to bookstores). Since neither of them own a car, though, they have to get a driver and they pick Bob Mapplethorpe (Robert Musgrave) simply because ...well ...he has a car. Their first felony occurs at the aforementioned bookstore and they make quick their getaway, leaving town and scurrying across the state. They end up at a motel in the middle of nowheresville and decide to hold up. But the trio quickly turns sour when a pretty young hotel maid name Inez (Lumi Cavazos) catches Anthony's eye. Speaking no English, the Central American goddess fails to realize how messed up yet in love Anthony is with her (partly due to the language barrier and partly do to Anthony's fumbling ways).Word eventually comes to Bob (the driver) that a family member is in trouble and he has to return to town. Since he has the only car, Anthony and (more importantly) Dignan, flip out, telling him he can't leave. But he does and leaves Anthony and Dignan stranded at the hotel (which is fine with the love-struck Anthony). But Dignan wants to get out of there, so he devises a plan to steal a car and return to their lives of thievery. Not wanting to leave without his newfound love interest, Anthony tries to convince Inez to come with them. A misunderstanding ensues and he and Dignan are back on their debauched road. Eventually they take on a robbery at a meat packing plant and it goes horribly. Risking everything, eventually a choice has to be made about who stays behind &#151; and takes the risk of capture &#151; and who goes free.It is the strange and quirky (there's that word again) that drives this film. Owen Wilson's character (Dignan) is obviously an extreme case of an excessive-compulsive. He plans out items to the nth degree, ensuring that everything is okay decades later. Anthony (Luke) struggles to regain some sense of normalcy in his life but keeps getting dragged back down by his bond with Dignan while being tugged the other direction by Inez.In the end, all turns out bizarrely well. Dignan ends up where he belongs, Owen gets what he needs, and even Inez finds what she's looking for.Certainly one of the less known Anderson films, this one still comes highly recommended, just not as highly as his more recent works.

Possibly the only way to make these things work is to find a new chink, a new layer between goofiness and endearing reality to invent. I say invent rather than depict because its all about where we place ourselves; if we can place ourselves new, that's usually enough to be effective, to connect.A large part of why this works is because it works toward an end that fails. Many movies are not about what we experience but what we remember, and the deal with this one is that we are left with someone who topples from any workable awareness. It reinvents that place where we are balanced throughout the movie. Even knowing the later films, I never wondered that this would end badly because the tone follows such a well established path, that one I've noted elsewhere. As with Legally Blond, there's a notion that earnestness will overcome inadequacies in all other life skills. One of the political parties in the US has appropriated this, so in a way this can be considered as a political movie.That last look is what this is all about, just as that first look of Jack Nicholson's in One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest.I came to this in part because of Owen's suicide attempt it adds context that matters.Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3 Worth watching.

The first thing that people think about when they see his name is of course his distinct style. This is something that is noticeable to even the casual moviegoer, even if they don't have the vocabulary to exactly describe or express it. And you see little hints of it here in Bottle Rocket. The hard angles of the frame looking down at objects being laid out for our characters to survey creeps up when Dignan outlines his 75 year plan to Anthony - perhaps not as rigidly as later Anderson. The characters are assigned snappy dialogue that is delivered with an air of nonchalance, particularly in situations of danger and risk. The motel, with its chic pink and white decor, is positively dollhouse-esque. And there are little details that would only later show up; here he is more likely to conventionally cut between subjects rather than use his trademark whip pan like a character turning his head. The biggest different, apart from this being his debut and still finding his stylistic feet, is the budget. Anderson's later features would later all have distinct colour palettes that bloomed in flat layers behind our morose main characters - as a sort of dramatic irony in their emotional distress that fails to recognise the beauty in the world around them. And he would have the financial freedom to dedicate huge amounts of detail into his production design for lavish scenes that might only last a few minutes; see the intro for The Royal Tenenbaums. To his credit, Anderson gets more than his money's worth in Bottle Rocket. The aforementioned motel looks like something out a faded postcard, still and pale in its serenity. Yeoman's strong yellows and reds punctuate each scene and seem to represent comfort in Dignan and Anthony's respective dress. Ultimately, the story of Bottle Rocket is a littler underdeveloped. Anderson twists the usual small-time crooks into these vivid storybook characters and fills them with his own brand of awkward humour. They plan an elaborate escape from the mental hospital, only to realise that anyone can walk in and out. They methodically canvas an empty house only to have revealed that it is Anthony's family house and that they have a specific list of approved and forbidden items in mind. A life of crime is more an inconvenience to them rather than a career path, and they are easily sidetracked. The plot moves quickly towards an end that is a logical failure. It doesn't seem to be too much of a concern because they are not vicious criminals but misunderstood grown up boys who have not yet found their calling in life. There's a sweet romance that blossoms as expected. The brothers quarrel and make up. They are scolded by the same people they rob, and take care to adjust the figurine display while they steal. While normal characters would be left speechless at their mentor robbing them blind, they shake their heads and chuckle. And there are those supercharged moments when one- liners are spit out and the soundtrack roars into recognition, but Anderson doesn't yet have that subtlety about his films. It's all about the Stones song. Nothing really seems to stick, and the lessons are vague and overly reliant on earnestness, as if this is enough to carry them throughout a lifetime. Their upbeat attitude won't be unseated. In the end, there's enough chemistry and natural charm to make it an enjoyable watch.

This is where it all started for Wes Anderson and despite not being a box office hit he slowly built a reputation for himself by remaining unique to his quirky sense of humor. Many criticized the fact that these characters didn't seem real, and that is probably true for all of Anderson's film where he focuses on dysfunctional characters with a whimsical sense of humor. Anderson's comedies are very different and they aren't for mainstream audiences, thus the reason why the screening of this film scored the worst test screening points in the history of Columbia Pictures during that time. I am glad Wes stayed true to his style and didn't sell out because his next films share similar trademarks which he began establishing in Bottle Rocket. This is perhaps his most normal looking film if you take into account the cinematography, but the quirky sense of humor is pretty much the same as well as some other technical aspects of the film (the font title cards at the beginning and the slow motion shot at the end). The same can be said for Owen Wilson who kind of plays this dumb but nice guy character in most of his comedies. It's not Anderson's best work, but his quirky style began taking shape with Bottle Rocket. The screenplay was co-written by Wes Anderson and Owen Wilson from a short they had made a couple of years earlier. The film opens with Dignan (Owen Wilson) trying to help his best friend, Anthony (Luke Wilson) escape from a mental institution. Dignan has designed a great escape plan, but what he doesn't know is that Anthony can leave the institution upon his free will considering he voluntarily signed up for it after he had a nervous breakdown from exhaustion. This opening scene clearly establishes that Dignan is less sane than Anthony. He has established a long term plan for the two involving a criminal spree. The first step is robbing Anthony's mother's house but they can only take a few valueless items. The idea is that they get some criminal experience so they can catch the attention of Dignan's former boss, Mr. Henry (James Caan), who is sort of a legend in the criminal world. Next they plan a bookstore robbery, but this time they will need a getaway driver so they convince their friend Bob (Robert Musgrave) to join them. After successfully achieving their plan they hide out at a nearby motel where Anthony falls deeply in love with a Paraguayan maid named Inez (Lumi Cavazos). This is where the dysfunctional group of friends breaks down and things take a turn for each one of them.Bottle Rocket was on Martin Scorsese's list of his top 10 favorite movies of the 90's. The quirky sense of humor isn't for everyone, but fans of Wes Anderson's comedies will really enjoy this considering it was the birthing point of some of his technical achievements. It may be less depressing and cynical in tone than some of his other comedies, but the whimsy characters he creates are very familiar. You can clearly see the fascination he has for exploring these dysfunctional relationships of dorky middle to upper class people. It's a refreshing film and very different from your standard buddy comedy. It's witty and despite not having many hilarious moments, the film does manage to keep a smile on your face for most of its runtime. For a debut performance Owen Wilson really shines on screen and delivers his lines with perfect timing. I really enjoyed this offbeat comedy although I wouldn't recommend this to anyone who isn't a fan of Wes Anderson. I always recommend my favorite, The Royal Tenenbaums, to people who haven't seen any of his film. "},{"Title":"You're complicated aren't you?  I try not to be.","Date":"8 June 2011","Score":"","Genre":"Comedy, Crime, Drama","Review":" This film is what Napoleon Dynamite must dream about as he polishes his glasses and irons his T shirt for the next day. Imagine being quirky, hip, exciting and fresh at one point, then a decade later still being all of those things &#x96; instead of the punchline to a million jokes and nothing more than fodder for the lamest and most dated of office jokers.Imagine that &#x96; Gosh.Bottle Rocket follows two friends (real life brothers) Dignan and Anthony through perhaps a few months of their life.Dignan is an over-zealous and under-equipped wannabe master thief.Anthony is open, honest and a little innocent (without being naïve), he just wants to please everyone and not cause any trouble.These two characters can co-exist, but Anthony's simple goals cannot be met when Dignan is around, as Dignan's desire to commit pointless crimes takes advantage of Anthony's need to please, meaning he is constantly doing things he doesn't want to do.As we learn early Dignan is patterning his next carefully planned 75 years around teaming up with a gang of master-thieves lead by Mr Henry, who Dignan had the good fortune to work with for a short time while Anthony was in a voluntary mental health clinic. Along with Bob, a guy who just wants to be involved Dignan and Anthony pull an early heist, using unnecessary tactics and pointless and ineffective methods. Thankfully for them their small time crime is somewhat below the radar, though they still go on the lam and hide out until the coast is clear, and really this is where the movie gains steam.+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ While on the run, at least in their minds the team stay in a cheap motel. Bob and Anthony are basically relaxing and Dignan is plotting the next big move, acting like they just successfully pulled a heist on the Louvre instead of taking a couple hundred bucks from a closed bookstore.Anthony meets a young oddly-pretty maid named Inez, who doesn't speak English. They hit it off, or at least Anthony thinks so, there is quite a communication issue that Anthony seems content to ignore.When Bob has some home issues and scarpers in the middle of the night, taking his car and leaving the other two stranded Dignan is furious at the perceived betrayal. When reasoning fails Dignan and Anthony have a falling out and go separate ways.Of course the gang meets back up, meets Mr Henry at last and has more adventures, or at least one more.+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ But this is not a heist flick, or a crime flick, and definitely not a drama or thriller &#x96; in fact it is really not about much of anything. Like the best and worst of director Wes Anderson Bottle Rocket seems to indulge in just watching the characters as they deal with situations that range from extremely mundane to mildly involving. There are no big explosions in these films, no especially witty dialogue, no Tarantino-esque long stories and speeches and no big getaways or 43 killed in a hail of bullets action sequences.You either smile and chuckle as you watch the film and let yourself get involved in the story or you will be bored as hell, there isn't too much middle ground.To sum up Wes Anderson's work with one quote I always think of this brief exchange between Anthony and a random girl in Bottle Rocket Girl &#x96; You're complicated aren't you? Anthony &#x96; I try not to be. By not complicating matters and allowing the story to just be Wes Anderson may never get huge box-office business, but when it works his films are effortlessly charming and worthwhile. Bottle Rocket might just be the best example of that.Final Rating &#x96; 8 / 10. Wes Anderson may never make a truly great movie, but if he made more like Bottle Rocket that isn't a bad outcome at all.

Bottle Rocket is a rather simple plot but thats sorta a good thing. Also the characters are likable (esp. Owen Wilson as Dignan), the dialogue is good, the story is pretty interesting, and the film doesn't try to be funny. The humour in this film is great- not laugh out loud funny but there are funny moments involving the situations and within the dialogue. The film was rated R but it was a light R rated film. There's not much violence and the language consists of only seven f-bombs. Though I felt that the ending could have been stronger and it seemed like an ending that was meant for a sequel. It left some questions unanswered. It may not be Anderson's best film but its still pretty good and a great time to fill in 90 minutes.

Oh it just has limited appeal or you just have to get it. No. It's just not funny. Yes you will chuckle at parts, but that's about it. It's almost too obvious that this script was watered down or padded some to make it a feature length. If anything is worth seeing, it would be the original short.

I think Wes Anderson is one of the most original and talented directors working today; I LOVED Tenenbaums, The Life Aquatic, and The Darjeeling Limited. While Bottle Rocket is not on par with these great movies it is a sure sign of the greatness to come.This is a meandering, character-driven story, as social rejects Anthony, Dignan and Bob attempt to assert themselves in the adult world by embarking on a well-structured but inevitably dysfunctional life of crime. I love the fact that Owen Wilson is willing to play himself as a goof or a nutjob, and his little asides are probably the funniest thing in the movie. During the robbery of a bookstore he holds the manager at gunpoint and asks, Do you have a bigger bag? One you might use for atlases and dictionaries, sir? These guys are harmless but their emotional pain is real, and their decision to become outlaws seems like just a way to tell the world they're unhappy. What about? Like other Anderson/Wilson collaborations the characters in the film do not feel accepted, or loved. All they might really need is a father figure... the guys seem happiest not when they're pulling their capers but when they've been adopted by James Caan's Mr. Henry character, who serves- briefly- as the benevolent protector they so badly need.The title Bottle Rocket is in reference to the scene in the movie when the boys blow their robbery loot on firecrackers and throw them out the window of their car. It's a juvenile noise-maker, like their foray into crime, and a fleeting sparkle, like the first movie of a director headed for greatness. This movie isn't perfect, but it's sweet, and warm-hearted, and a must-see for anyone who enjoys Wes Anderson and Owen Wilson at their best.GRADE B+ "},{"Title":"A very well written and different caper comedy that works on many levels.","Date":"3 August 2009","Score":"","Genre":"Comedy, Crime, Drama","Review":" Bottle Rocket is one of the most original and unique films that I have ever seen. With witty dialogue and great on screen performances, this film is a massive hit. With his first performance as actor on the big screen Owen Wilson also co-writes Bottle Rocket. The story is focused on three young aged friends in their life of crime, robbing houses and planning heists.These three men; Dignan, Anthony, and Bob are not bad guys. They are just a trio of men looking for something fun and exciting to do in their mostly boring lives. Having no jobs Dignan, Anthony, and Bob decide to pull of heists for fun. Let me get to introducing these characters, Dignan is a somewhat dumb yet riskless man who has nothing going on in his life and he is the so called mastermind behind the plans. Anthony is Dignan's best friend who was rescued from a mental hospital with the help of Dignan. Anthony put himself in the hospital for self-described exhaustion. This man is not crazy. The last of the trio is Bob. Bob is a very dumb and stupid idiot. Bob is the getaway driver in the heists called on upon by Dignan. There is not much to really know about Bob, pretty much only one word describes him.....idiot.After making a road trip buying a few guns these men plan their next heist, a local bookstore. They manage to steal a small sum from the store and succeed in getting away safely. They then decide to spend the night at a hotel on the side of the highway. At the hotel, Anthony spots maid Inez and the two fall into a romantic relationship although she cannot speak English very well. Before leaving the hotel, Anthony gives Dignan an envelope for Inez. Dignan delivers the envelope not knowing how much money is inside. She also unaware of this. Dignan steals a car but quickly breaks down in the middle of the highway. Anthony reveals that the envelope he gave to Inex contained the rest of the cash from the heist. Coming to the anger and disappointment of Dignan, the two go there separte ways from there. I will not reveal the rest of the story to anyone, not wanting to spoil it for anyone. That was just a brief summary on the film's simple yet brilliant and original storyline.Bottle Rocket being witty and funny at the same time marks Wes Anderson's film debut, which is a fascinating indicator of what is to come. Being a cult classic this film holds up to repeated viewings to please fans every time. Bottle Rocket also stars Luke Wilson, Robert Musgrave, Lumi Cavazos, and James Cann all giving good performances. But Owen Wilson is the one that shines in the cast giving a terrific debut performance, which also holds true for Wes.

The key is tying that obscurity into something that people can understand and relate to. With Bottle Rocket, Wes Anderson (in his very first cinematic credits) establishes that he understands this must be done and he does it with relationships. While Bottle Rocket may not be all that poignant or satisfy the tastes of all movie watchers, it certainly does offer its own style of entertainment. For those familiar with Anderson's more mainstream work, this is a film that brings some insight into how he established himself as a revered director.Let's not forget the Wilson brothers either. Both Owen and Luke can thank this film for being a great resume starter. It highlights the very talents that they took with them all the way to the bank in the last ten years. Luke is Anthony Adams, a lovable, naive guy who finds himself in trouble thanks to those around him, namely Owen's character Dignan, the quirky, high-aimer who takes things to a comically serious level. You see attributes of these characters echo in nearly every role they've played since this film gave them a spotlight. Together, the two are small time crooks who consider themselves professionals and set out with their friend Bob only to further reveal to the viewer that they have no talent whatsoever. There's not a whole lot driving this plot. While part of that is the point, more could actually happen to make things interesting. Instead, this is mostly focused on how the characters all deal with their collective ineptitude. They argue like most friends argue, only most friends aren't amateur thieves. Like Anderson's films after this, the characters all wrestle between a group or family mentality and their individual desires. It's very easy to see for anyone who has seen most of Anderson's work. Fortunately for him, these characters and dilemmas only get stronger and more interesting as his career progresses.The film is also not much of a comedy. While Anderson never has done traditional comedy, the laughs come at the expense of some of the strange characters. They're not nearly strange enough to be consistently funny. Instead, the characters and the whole film is likable, but that's about where it stops. It never gets beyond likable. At least likable is better than bad and this film is definitely leaves a good taste in your mouth.

Working, essentially, with a bunch of friends, it's no surprise that Anderson does well with the actors, with both Luke and co-writer/actor Owen Wilson acting as well as they'd ever act, not that they didn't equal this sort of performance later on, but they never exceeded it.The use of music is good, though even this not quite at the level of Anderson's later work. All in all Bottle Rocket is a remarkable film on several levels but also a flawed film, often betraying the fact that it was a cheaply-made independent film. Well worth watching, regardless, and featuring the first of many great Wes Anderson final shots.7.5/10 "}{"Title":"A rough sketch of what's to come from Wes Anderson","Date":"25 November 2007","Score":"","Genre":"Comedy, Crime, Drama","Review":" If there is one recurring theme in any Wes Anderson film it usually involves a look into the lives of grown men who have not done much in the ways of growing up. In Bottle Rocket three best friends, all grown men living in a middle class suburb, find meaning in their lives by being thieves. It's not clear why they want to steal but they never bother to go legit. What we have instead of a plot driven narrative is a character study about men who still think they're thirteen years old. Don't take this the wrong way, I enjoyed the film for the most part but it clearly is a directorial debut for Wes Anderson as the film structure is very rough. Within the film you can kind of make out his style that we know he will ultimately improve in his other films but what I find interesting is that theme I mentioned.In Rushmore, although the protagonist is in High School, it's easy to see the immaturity of the adults that surround him (and what will become of him in adulthood?). In The Royal Tannenbaum's the adults of the family are dysfunctional because of the way they were raised so the character's have to come up with what they believe how grown ups are supposed to act. In The Darjeeling Limited the main characters act very much like they most likely did as children, with one character upset at the responsibilities of becoming a father.I remember when MTV had done a quick featurette on this film, shortly before it was released, it contained a quick interview with the Owen brothers detailing Cahn's dismay with not being able to get an answer as to why the film was called Bottle Rocket. The brothers got a kick out of it and it's no surprise that their sense humor in the interview is very much like the one displayed in the movie. Regardless, the film had piqued my interest but for whatever reason I didn't see it. Since then I have seen every Wes Anderson film, including The Darjeeling Limited and it wasn't until after seeing his last film that I decided to back-track and see this. In other words I did not witness his evolution as a film maker in any linear sense but now it's clear what he's been trying to do and say with his characters and I'm not sure I would have noticed it had I not seen his films in this order.Put it this way, because of his other films, I was able to appreciate Bottle Rocket and if you are a fan of his and have not seen it then you should do so as I think you'll like it. However, I'd be hard pressed to recommend this to someone who isn't familiar with his work.

(Think about your favorite comedies of the past 10 years and see how many have a Wilson brother.) In this one, two friends go out to become professional bandits. But things don't make it very far as one falls for a Paraguayan woman and their getaway driver gets away. The plot might be thin, but that has never really been the point if you are familiar with the antics of these men. The Wilsons need no plot.I enjoyed how much Owen Wilson seemed un-Owen. He had a very different sort of character than usual, more aggressive and unstable. It was a nice change. The Inez character was also very nice, someone you could feel bad for yet admire. The scene where Luke Wilson begins to fall for her is endearing and cute in that puppy dog way.Nothing more to say... watch this film. Unless of course you hated Tenenbaums, Rushmore and Life Aquatic (and I admit some people don't care for them). If you don't like those, this one will bore you to tears.

Sure, his next two films display a greater maturity and perhaps a more acute examination of human nature, but 'Bottle Rocket' is - in my ever-controversial opinion - the funniest. It's incredibly stupid because it bases itself upon stupid characters and it ultimately falls into the clutches of the 'standard romantic subplot,' but it's also so damn hilarious at times that I just couldn't keep a smile off of my face while watching it, which is a true rarity.Perhaps the reason I found myself growing fond of this film is because the whole ridiculous whimsicality of it reminded me of my state of mind as a child. This applies to the character of Dignan especially, who I see as a guy who just never really grew up. As unbelievably stupid of a concept as this is, Owen Wilson manages to make it charming with his charismatic portrayal of this dimwit. Where the film doesn't really make sense is in the character of Anthony, who sort of borders between being a rational person and just as dumb as the rest of them by going ahead with these schemes for no convincing reason, and the sudden love story I guess is supposed to represent his 'awakening,' which is surprisingly uncreative for a Wes Anderson movie.But then I think back to the dialogue Anthony calmly asserting that he was hospitalized because he 'went nuts.' The whole 'nose tape' conversation between Anthony, Dignan, and the doorman. Dignan timidly asking the employee for a 'bigger bag for maps and atlases.' Dignan getting angry because Bob 'stole' his own car. Rocky ostensibly telling Dignan that he loves Anthony. Dignan promising that he'll get 'sadistic' on Bob. And certain moments Mr. Henry pouring water down onto Dignan from the rooftop. The whole heist-gone-awry at the end of the film and Dignan's subsequent attempt to get away - running into a room marked 'No Exit.'Wes Anderson was just developing his upbeat and energetic directorial style here, but it's clearly visible in certain sequences such as when cinematographer Yeoman's camera follows pacing characters front-on to Mark Mothersbaugh's background music.

Anthony and Inez(the hotel maid) relationships is fascinating to watch. He keeps talking to her and following her around even though she doesn't speak english. Funny stuff.

I would categorize this film as a quirky independent comedy that's got a lot of sublety to it.  Reading through the reviews, I noticed a few comments like boring, or doesn't live up to its potential, but I don't feel that way.  I found the film thoughtful and thought-provoking, and I don't think I was ever once bored.  Its humor is sometimes overt, sometimes veiled.  I also enjoyed the music, the cinematography (if that's what you call what I'm thinking of), and the editing.The situations and characters are believable to me, even if, at the same time, they aren't; if you know what I mean.  The characters and the situations they get themselves into just sort of draw you in, regardless of how plausible they really are.  I found myself enjoying it quite a bit.This will probably become a top favorite for me (along with Groundhog Day, The Shawshank Redemption, Rain Man, The Hudsucker Proxy, Glory, and Lock, Stock, & Two Smoking Barrels, to mention a few).  I'd definitely recommend it to anyone who asks me.That said, and as others' reviews indicate, it just *isn't* for everyone. It's not so much that they don't get it -- it's just that some people just don't find certain kinds of humor that funny.  That's OK.  Take the risk and give it a shot, because you might really love it.  If not, oh well.IMHO, it's worth seeing more than once, and I don't say that too often. And the ending leaves you thinking -- in an enjoyable kind of way.  8½ out of 10.

First off, this is my first time viewing the film and I have already seen Rushmore (director/co-writers second film, this one being his first). I had not been able to find this to rent anywhere up until yesterday, and my interest to see it was at an all time high considering my adoration for Rushmore and heavy anticipation for the creative teams latest, THE ROYAL TENNENBAUMS. I went into this film knowing it was a low budget, indie film, and in that respect it fully delivers. In fact it reminds me how funny and simple films could be. It begins with a successful escape from a Mental Institute where Anthony (Luke Wilson) is staying. The mastermind behind the operation is Anthony's not so bright friend Didnan (Owen Wilson, proving his comedic timing in this film). You'll see why this is funny when you watch the movie, and it sets up the main characters perfectly. Wes Anderson co-wrote the film with Owen Wilson, as well as directed. I absolutely loved Rushmore and would say that it is one of my all time top 10 favorite films...ever! Watching this film was a treat (excuse the use of that word, but it really was). I smiled and laughed at the situations, all spread out and paced perfectly (perhaps a little too slow for others tastes, all depend on how you look at the film). Bottle Rocket is as beuatifully filmed as it is funny. The cinematography really helped this simple story develop and added depth to the situations. For example, the bookstore robbery scene, in which everything looks vacant...really vacant. You'll know what I mean, and why this scene works when you watch the movie. So watch it! There's also the introduction of James Caan's character, whose presence I seemed to find distracting at first more then anything else, but there is a pay off, and his low-key performance was right on. The dialogue is hilarious, and all the characters in this film have great chemistry. It's no wonder the director used many of them again in his latest efforts. I also enjoyed the odd romance build-up for Anthony, and it showed that the director truly enjoyed the subject matter since he went on to explore it further, and with much more importance in Rushmore. All in all this film follows a simple narrative leading to simple pay offs. The pace serves the story and its characters. These are people that just want to talk and live and do...something...anything. So they rob. It's hilarious, and fun to watch. I recommend you see it if your a fan of the creative teams present work. If not you should probably give these movies another chance.

It is easy for me to get up and get a sandwich in middle of either of his films.  Perhaps it is analogous to walking around the Uffizi. Are you taken by Hans Memling or Antonio Allegri?

He shuns irony and hipness, and has a compassion for his characters that is reminiscent of Nicholas Ray or Leo McCarey, and a deft touch that is somewhat like Lubitsch.  Bottle Rocket is a beautiful work of touching comedy that rests its unblinking gaze on its characters, who are as flawed and ridiculous as we all can be, yet there is little doubt that Anderson loves all of them.  His carefully (and practically) composed framing of the visuals suggests a world of its own--not the Texas we know, but a Texas in another dimension, seen through the eyes of love.Isn't it strange and beautiful how Anderson makes his films multicultural events without drawing attention to them?  Bottle Rocket and Rushmore have Asian characters, white characters, black characters, Latino characters--yet its done so skillfully that you only notice that they are people, not ethnicities.  Bottle Rocket suggests a vision of a world untouched by hatred, except on the very edges, where the core of a universe is one of honesty and compassion.

I love Wes Anderson and Owen Wilson's focus on underachievers; it's very refreshing, honest, and sincere.  The people in this movie aren't glamorous movie stars with perfect bodies and sharp minds, but at the same time they're not depressingly unmotivated drug addicts either; they're utterly mediocre individuals and are very interesting because of it.  In particular, Owen Wilson's character is very interesting because, although he is a total underachiever, he thinks he is destined for great things--and rather than ridiculing him, like a conventional comedy may have done, the filmmakers have chosen instead to sympathize with him, or at least to portray him in an unbiased light.  In other words, he's depicted as a human being rather than a comic relief device.  All the characters in the film are very humorous, but they never feel like they're just funny factories that churn out one pre-fabricated joke after another without having any personality or emotional complexity.As with Rushmore, the soundtrack to this movie is awesome.If you like films with strong plots that really motivate the story, though, you might not like this.

I don't even know where to begin...Written by Wes Anderson and Owen Wilson, directed by Anderson -- this is the same team that brought you Rushmore.  If you liked Rushmore at all, do yourself a favor and go rent Bottle Rocket.  The humor in Bottle Rocket is even more subtle than Rushmore, if that's possible.Like Rushmore, it's as much a character study as a story.  The leads are deep and genuine, but not complex.  They have simple desires, the most overriding of them being to do something, and do it together.The movie is quirky and eccentric, but it's not overdone.  It doesn't force itself on you as a quirky film at all.  There are no pop culture references -- these characters are just off in their own world, which is perfectly natural to them, and the viewer. Owen Wilson is great as Dignan.  His childlike ambition becomes honorable. Anthony Wilson is excellent as the true, quiet leader of the group.  Bob Musgrave (no relation) is perfect as the lackey.The humor is so subtle and ironic that it will take several times to catch it all.  I didn't come to love this movie until I had seen it two or three times.  One of the most amazing things about it, is that there are no wasted lines in the movie.  Every single line has some significance, some underlying irony, or is downright hilarious.  That's rare.  It brings to mind Max Fischer's line in Rushmore when he's directing the play Don't say it didn't matter.  Every line matters! or something to that effect.The actors are perfect, the settings are perfect, the colors are perfect, the music is perfect.  It's amazing how Anderson must have truly had everyone involved in the movie on the same page.  Everyone, including Mark Mothersbaugh of Devo fame, who was responsible for the music, 'gets' it.  It makes for a brilliant movie.Do yourself a favor and go rent this movie now.  Watch it, and don't give up on it.  As long as you are tuned in to this type of humor, watch it again. More will come out the second time around.  Once you know the ending and get a feel for the characters, its so much fun to go back and watch them again.

Like in most feel-good movies, it's hard to keep rooting for a character who continuously has bad luck.

In any case, this film is worth seeing.  You may find yourself a convert.

I love Moonrise Kingdom and Fantastic Mr. Fox, they both had a unique style, great performances, and well-written stories. Other times, I won't like his films such as The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou where the humor didn't work for me and most of the film lacked much of an actual plot. Nearly the same goes for Bottle Rocket, his first film. Digan (Owen Wilson) rescues (but not really, he was getting out anyway) Anthony (Luke Wilson) from a psychiatric unit and Digan shows his plan of being involved in heists and building an entire life plan from there. The entire movie doesn't actually have much of a plot. In fact, it reminded me of a movie like Slacker directed by Richard Linklater, except unlike Slacker, this movie involved all of the same characters being involved in conversations about a whole lot of nothing where as Slacker involved multiple people in random conversations.Owen and Luke Wilson definitely play there roles with some charisma and are fairly entertaining but the writing itself&#x85;is just kind of boring. The humor was lacking. I laughed here and there but it wasn't very often. And besides that, the plot is still so unbelievably empty. Barely anything happens up until the last 10 minutes which are arguably the most entertaining part of the film. The enjoyment of this film really depends on if you like the dialogue. For me, it kept me uninterested most of the time except the occasional peak moments of humor and the charisma from the actors. Spiced throughout the film, you notice Anderson's beginnings of his style from his music choices, some of his camera choices, amongst other things which was nice to see as a fan of some of his movies. Overall, I'd consider this a film a bit of a disappoint but I can't say I full-on hated it, it was an oddly relaxing film to watch, maybe due to its simplicity even if it is much too simple.

Bottle Rocket was essentially an independent experiment with such subtle humor that it is not received well by all audiences. The brilliance of this picture lies in its undertones, and that does not sit well for people who want immediacy, scatological humor, and famous actors. Sure, they were able to secure James Caan as the ridiculous, kung fu fighting crime boss, but Owen and Luke were unknown, and almost unrecognizable to their current Hollywood characters. This movie is so funny I bought it twice, after I loaned it to a friend who never returned the DVD. It is replete with layers of comedy, unforgettable quotes, and Anderson's signature direction, before it was replicated and mimicked by followers. Admittedly, this film is not technically as superior as the Royal Tenenbaums or maybe even Rushmore. However, it is the bare bones production that make the comedic performances in this film so apparently superior.If you see this film once and don't catch what everyone is talking about, watch it one or two more times and listen carefully.

There are a number of things that Wes Anderson does with his films that don't necessarily force people to guffaw and shriek with laughter, but rather invites the audience to appreciate intelligent dry humour. Because that is essentially what it is and what makes it even more appealing, is the fact that it's all tightly wrapped up in outrageous plots, sets and costume design. (a deep sea adventure movie, a family of geniuses, a revenge high school drama, matching scuba suits, red Adidas tracksuits and of course those yellow jumpsuits).Bottle Rocket is Simply put...Brilliant. The Wilson Brothers are masters in their own right both playing off each others strengths. Owen the typical high octane overambitious rascal while Luke is the more sombre detuned unsure character just following footsteps.

Anderson crafts charming characters such as Dignan, Anthony Adams, Inez, etc. This movie may be considered light hearted yet it still touches real life emotions such as love, friendship, loyalty, and insanity. In the opening of Bottle Rocket we learn Anthony Adams is in a voluntary mental institution. This is where we first get a sense of the hilarity that is Dignan. Dignan devises a master plan to free Anthony from the mental home. It is in the first scene we learn Dignan does not have such a high mental capacity but is dedicated, caring, and loves to scheme things. Throughout the film we meet memorable characters along the way. Even James Caan as Mr. Henry. The movie is filled with jokes and quotable lines from Dignan, mainly. Also the love story within Bottle Rocket is one of the key factors that makes it so dear to me. Anthony falls for a cleaning maid at a hotel he and his cohorts hide at after a bookstore robbery. The end climax is brilliant. Dignan, Anthony, Bob, Mr. Henry, Applejack, and Kumar attempt to burglarize Hinckley Cold Storage. This is where we get the classic They'll never catch me because I'm f------ innocent I can't help but smile throughout this whole movie.

While most of its contemporaries wallowed in the lack of motivation and desire in their characters, Bottle Rocket takes the exact opposite approach.The characters all try to define themselves in spite of the basic underlying existential dilemma they all find themselves in how does one do something with their life when everything is essentially meaningless. These are not slackers because they desperately want to make their lives worthwhile, but don't see the opportunity within the structure of today's materialistic bourgeois society. And so they embark on a journey of petty crime and each find their own transcendence For Anthony it is the love of a woman from a complete different culture and set of values; For Bob, it is the love of his brother and ties to his family. Dignan realizes that his own transcendence in a life of crime and adventure is contrived and yet still embraces it, bringing his action at the end of the film to a true act of heroism, not unlike that at the end of the Wild Bunch.What brings all of this together is Anderson's fresh take on the subject. Obviously inspired by Hal Ashby and Mike Nichols early work, Anderson exercises a restraint here that is absent from his subsequent films. There is less contrivance, less use of music as means to show off a new directorial technique. Yes, it is a quirky and off beat world. But unlike the worlds of Rushmore or Tennenbaums, it is at least grounded in some semblance of reality. And I can't help but think that James Brooks, the executive producer, had more than a hand in shaping, at least the emotional content, of the final product. I understand that many people enjoy Wes Anderson's completely constructed universes and find that the more eccentric they are, the more entertaining they are. I personally enjoy it when the form of the film COMPLEMENTS, rather than dictates, its content. There is nothing as off putting to me as when I feel I am watching a director trying to something deliberately cool or quirky just so that we're aware that we're watching something different. Bottle Rocket shows the promise of a very talented young director that has the ability to use an unusual style to bring his world to life. It is unfortunate that he does not seem likely to reign in this style anytime soon.

The whole romance thing never works when it's worked into the movie as clumsily as it is here. It also seemed so misplaced in this film; it might have worked had it been done with just a little bit more seriousness, in fact, the whole film would have had to have been more serious.

Dignan despite the fact he is simply a petty thief. Through he little dialogs and mannerisms, he is almost able to convince you he doesn't mean to do others harm, but is really just seeking a place to be be recognized and to belong.Like his brother, Luke Wilson also shows a little bit of what would come to be his stereotypical role. He plays Anthony, the earnest and honest follower who would rather settle down and find love then get involved in illegal activities. In this role he manages to convince us he only gets involved out of a sense of loyalty, rather than to actually gain anything for himself.I was a bit let down by the Bob character, played by Robert Musgrave. He reminds me of a jelly fish, both in his character and in his acting you see the vague outline of what he is trying to be, but in the end there is very little substance to hang on to. Bob apparently yearns for acceptance by his brother, but ends up looking like a man without a backbone.StoryThe loose plot revolves around the lives of three friends in their attempts to build lives for themselves. Anthony apparently is just looking for someone to love, Dignan is seeking a club to belong to and Bob desires a loving relationship with his brother.

He later went on to make painfully boring films that included 70s Folk Rock, painfully eccentric characters and truck loads of pretension.

He thinks it is enough to give a character a funny name and let him stare or walk. This still works for about 30 minutes (which much have been the reason I liked the shorter and earlier 1994 version of Bottle Rocket way better) but it starts to get old pretty soon. Especially when nothing else is really happening in its script with its story and characters.This really disappointed me. It's one of those movies that tries to be as simple and realistic as possible, like independent movies often tend to do. Like a random slice of life, except with the problem that it just isn't that interesting to follow for 90 minutes long. It attempts to make even its most crazy events look realistic, which is a part of Wes Anderson his sort of comedy but I would had liked to get some more substance in this case. I just got nothing out of watching this movie.This really feels like a movie that got made by a bunch of student buddies, who went out to shoot a movie. In some way that also really was the case with this movie actually. Wes Anderson, as well as the Owen brothers (who strangely enough don't play brothers in this movie) were basically fresh out of school when they did this movie and it was their first full length production. In that regard you perhaps have to give some respect and credits to this movie. It paved the way for their careers and it's also somewhat fun to see how they haven't really deviated away from their own style, ever since.Good for its first 30 minutes or so but after that it starts to run out of steam fast.6/10http//bobafett1138.blogspot.com/ "},{"Title":"Doesn't explode, yet isn't a dud","Date":"5 June 2012","Score":"3 out of 6 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Crime, Drama","Review":" The story of Wes Anderson's Bottle Rocket goes a little something like this. Anderson shot a thirteen minute short film, featuring the three leads of this picture, showed it at Sundance, got the attention of filmmaker James L. Brooks, and he was one of the seven producers on the film adaptation of the short. While a box office failure, the picture launched the reputations of both Luke and Owen Wilson as actors and Wes Anderson has an eclectic director.We are taken to the upper-class Texas suburbs where Dignan (Owen Wilson) breaks his brother Anthony (Wilson) out of a mental hospital, and plan to conduct a series of elaborate heists with their friend Bob (Musgrave). Their goal is to challenge life in suburbia and rebel against the norms of recurring, everyday life. Haven't we heard that before.After they stage a pitiful robbery at a bookstore, the three go on the lam at a hotel. While there, Anthony meets and falls in love with a housekeeper named Ines (Cavazos), and Dignan fears that with Bob's continued incompetence and lack of loyalty, along with Anthony's lovestruck ways that their dreams of being robbers are over.One thing I was immediately impressed with was the warm look Bottle Rocket accompanies throughout its runtime. It's common to have a layer of cynicism in movies, but it seems that Wes Anderson's directorial effort is determined to fine the whimsicality of movies, the softness of their appearance, and the overall genial aspect of film itself. In short, the film always looks crisp and gentle. Not to mention, the actors are all flavorful, with both the Wilson brothers giving rather memorable performances, and the late appearance of James Caan is a pretty nice addition to the film.Though some marginally convincing performances, warmth, and identifiable whimsicality can not entirely elevate a picture, and that is where Anderson's Bottle Rocket flounders. It's so thin and trudges through its ninety minute runtime at a sluggish pace. The dialog scenes are nice, but rather uninvolving, as we learn that these characters truly have no motives of robbing random places other than to be difficult and stand out. As a whole, the film starts off slow, becomes vaguely amusing for a brief amount of time, before the experience ends and the whole thing is quickly forgotten. Sort of like a bottle rocket itself.Starring Luke Wilson, Owen Wilson, Robert Musgrave, Lumi Cavazos, and James Caan. Directed by Wes Anderson. "},{"Title":"Awful!

Viewers expecting the same bottled madcap magic Anderson would later deliver in Rushmore, The Royal Tennenbaums, and The Life Aquatic  . . . will not find much here.Anderson critics building their cases against disappointments like The Darjeeling Limited will find in this film the seeds of the auteur's excesses sometimes getting the better of his projects. Combining the talents of Owen Wilson and James Caan with some (much) lesser lights, the film is amply kitted out with dynamic actors. But those actors are not given much of a story to tell. Rather, the film unfolds almost as if Anderson was out to prove he could make a film that doesn't try to do storytelling.

So I went all the way back to his first directorial debut (not counting something short done before) and was pleasantly surprised. Just as I expected, back than at the age of 26 he didn't have all the financial background he can command today and yes, it does look like it was done on a shoe-string budget but at the same time it bursts with youthful energy, enthusiasm and absolutely endearing earnestness. Basically ignored by industry back than, Bottle Rocket was made by bunch of friends and it is about bunch of friends, sweet gentle losers who decide to turn to life of crime and adventure (they have plan for the next 75 years). The problem is, they are not really so dangerous or brutal, these are just three naive guys who can hardly have a conversation without getting into arguments and fights with each other. Luke Wilson and Robert Musgrave just tag along behind wonderful Owen Wilson who is heart of the movie, he is so darn crazy and sweet and annoying simultaneously that you are not sure do you want to hug him or hit him over the head. Almost everything they planned (and much more than they expected) goes terribly wrong and you can't help but to love them seriously for all their confused efforts and sincere love between them. Its not funny in a roaring way, but it touches you really deep because they are basically three outsiders with their own problems who understand and support each other. At the end of the movie I surprised myself being genuinely touched and even teared up a bit. More I think about it, more I am convinced its one of those sweet, unforgettable little movies that nobody has ever heard of. Martin Scorsese paid attention.

If he were to quit directing after this movie it would be at least a three. You can tell that Wes Anderson is clearly developing his style for cinematography and not for storytelling during this film. The entire premise of the movie is awkward and hard to watch since the Wilson brothers are frequently cast in more intelligent roles. Some scenes are boring, some scenes are confusing, but every once in a while you get a cheep laugh. I believe that Bob's condescending brother is the most humorous character in the film, besides maybe Mr.Henry, but they both play supporting roles. Acting from the main characters is dry, which is to be expected with any Wes Anderson flick. If you're a hip Wes Anderson fanatic, you would probably fall head over beard for this film. If not, do yourself a favor and check out Rushmore instead.

While Owen has always been more talented when it comes to comedy, Luke really knows how to make the most out of his dramatic talent and he's able to nail dramatic ticks and notes in his character that I don't think I've seen him do since (not in film, but certainly in Enlightened).

I was recommended to watch this film because I had a conversation about Wes Anderson with someone. I didn't know about his first film, Bottle Rocket, and my friend said she liked it because it was so laid back and appealed to her in some way.While I think it is a good first attempt for a film, and a good start for Wes Anderson. Although, I have to say that I got a good amount of the Wilson Brothers from the entire film, I thought it was admirable.It had it's moments and was shot decently well. There are a lot of problems with it. Motive for the story, the 2 dimensional characters with some important character traits, and a script that doesn't really work in the sense that it would serve to the story. This is long before Wes is making self aware quirky movies that pan to a certain type of trope or theme and it falls flat to deliver a solid movie with a plot that would make sense. It is incredibly well shot in a simple way and doesn't hit you over the head with anything, the performances feel a little forced, but it still all feels genuine enough to be believable.Once again, being that this is his first film, you can overlook a lot of the material and give him a pat on his back for what he was trying to accomplish. And he kind of hit it out of the park and began developing a style that some people would get under and truly respect. Anyway, that's my lightweight review of the movie. I don't want to bring up specific details of the film that bothered me or that I liked, but I would definitely give this a watch if you are interested enough in Wes Anderson as a director.

Some I really liked--such as The Royal Tannenbaums and Moonrise Kingdom. Some I did not like--such as The Life Aquatic With Steve Zissou. But one thing these films all have in common is a very slow (glacially slow) pace and very, very quirky characters and dialog. Because of that, it might be worth seeing this film simply because there ain't anything like it! The film has a plot but doesn't really get to it until the last quarter of the film! Up until then, the plot just meanders very slowly and mostly consists of the Wilson brothers (Owen and Luke) doing lots of seemingly irrelevant things up until they go on a heist (such as a long and directionless road trip). This lack of direction certainly will annoy most viewers though the acting was quite nice. Eventually, the heist does take place and the film improves SIGNIFICANTLY. I liked how incredibly inept and stupid the robbery turned out to be. But, again, at times it also seemed to meander.So did I like the film? Well, I am not sure. SOME of it I liked and much of it seemed in need of editing. At least it gave me a chance to see Anderson's and the Wilson brothers' first full-length film.By the way, Bottle Rocket was originally a short film (1994). If you watch it, you can see a lot of the later feature and it is interesting to see how the short morphed into the full-length film.

Anthony was recently released from an asylum after a nervous breakdown, but in truth seems to offer more justifiable claims to sanity. Nonetheless, despite reservations, Anthony agrees to assist Dignam in his ploys together with ultra-moronic neighbour and getaway driver Bob (Robert Musgrave). After a semi-successful steal the threesome decide to hide out in a roadside motel until the dust settles. There Anthony falls deeply for the non-English-speaking Mexican maid Inez (Lumi Cavazos), thus necessitating a rewrite to the hapless plans he has already conceived.The feature length debut is much of the what Wes Anderson has incorporated into his trademark career as the king of quirkiness. Despite several attempts and a watch of every Anderson movie conceivable his critical appeal remains a mystery to myself, and Bottle Rocket, arguably the most chaotic and purposeless story from the director was an undeniable torment to watch. With the whole middle of the story a misplaced filler, which attempts to expand the same-titled short film into a feature, the whole affair is tiresome, only really catching fire in the first and in the final act. Overall watchable for the first 30 minutes, afterwards the shenanigans at the motel with absolutely no focus derail any construed interest in the premise. Not intent on heading anywhere Anderson basically offers a collage of laid back quirky individuals trying to eek out a laugh, instead increasingly causing the Wilson brothers to become irritatingly overwhelming.Without much more on offer than odd-balls and oddities this is Wes Anderson's worst movie, which won't win over any of his doubters, who are best to look for other of his works to decide on whether Anderson's trademark quirk-attacks are 'no-no' or 'gung-ho'. For me personally the achingly convention subversive capers, the indulgent humour and the goofy character construction on offer by Anderson are extremely outside of my wavelengths.

In fact that whole robbery sequence is priceless. Also great is the whole love interest thing between Anthony and Inez which comes across so naturally. Not sure why somebody compared this with El Mariachi by Robert Rodriguez, pretty much like comparing Casablanca with Pulp Fiction I'd have thought. If like this person, you tend to think far too much and over analyse everything instead of just kicking back and enjoying something unfold before you, then give it a miss, not to be recommended though as this film's a treat.

I just read a post which said most of the material just falls flat. The gags are also a bit lame, half of the time.

I suggest you read some of the quotes from the memorable quotes section on IMDb and if they don't peak you're interest, stay away as you're probably among the bad reviewers here whom I guess have a more mainstream view of what is humorous.But if you like Rushmore and the Tannenbaums, there's a chance you might like this one even more.I also don't understand the reviewers who say the movie is not good because it doesn't have a point or the plot is not so great or not a good ending....huh?????....did you people see and like Rushmore and Tannenbaums?

I have seen Rushmore and the Royal Tenenbaums, and I am a huge fan of both of these films.  However, Bottle Rocket doesn't seem to be at the same level of quality as these two later films.  All of Wes Anderson's hallmarks are there  the theme of not fitting in, unusual and well chosen soundtrack, a veteran actor for a genial partriarch (James Caan for Bottle Rocket; Bill Murray for Rushmore; and Gene Hackman in the Royal Tenenbaums), and the Wilson brothers.  I'm also concerned there is a trend of female characters being less important in Wes Anderson films, and being relegated to the role of the exotic and unusual love interest.  This wasn't as apparent in the Royal Tenenbaums as it is in Bottle Rocket and Rushmore.It was hard to for me in this film to care about the characters, somehow, something was missing in them for me to really care.  All of the scenes that should have been funny just seemed empty and too contrived.  To give Bottle Rocket the benefit of the doubt, perhaps I do need to watch it again to fully appreciate it.

It's tough for me to laugh when someone's emoting real pain rather than cartoony pain. Also, the film is slow-paced and has many sentimental scenes, and it's hard for me to get sentimental when the protagonists are total losers.However, Bottle Rocket is definitely a comedy, and there are some hilarious moments. I once read Chuck Jones' autobiography (the guy who created Bugs Bunny) and he said that comedy is when the film is about a straight man getting mixed up with a weirdo. Farce is when the film is about the weirdo. He didn't say why, but for some reason comedy works and farce doesn't. Pee Wee's Big Adventure is a good example of a farce, as is Mr. Bean. A Fish Called Wanda was a comedy (the straight man was the John Cleese character).So I guess Bottle Rocket was a little too farce for me. I couldn't identify with the protagonists and therefore wasn't that interested in the drama bits.Who should see this film-- Drama film buffs who like comedies. (But I'm not sureif you'd find this film arty or just off-key.)-- Comedy moviegoers who aren't expecting Generic Hollywoodor Fast Paced Zany Comedy, and that's OK with them.I'll give Bottle Rocket a 5 out of 10.

Fortunately, my university library had a wonderful laser-disc copy. This is a Beautiful film. The acting, the script, and the cinematography are near perfection. If you are looking for a series of loud guffaws and obvious jokes, this movie isn't the place for them. What it is the place for is subtle, rich, dry, low key humor. There are a few well timed side splitters, but most the jokes are of the smiling kind, NOT  the laugh out loud kind.This is a terrific movie, and it is one of the few times that the egregious Michael Medved has been right in the assessment of a film it does herald a new, unique vision and sensibility.

Hundreds of scripts of this quality are submitted each month to Hollywood and are tossed promptly aside. They spent 8 million making this film, but it only made 1 million.The plot is sluggish, spending entirely too much time at the hotel where the boys, fresh off a botched robbery, are hiding out without a clue as to what to do next.SPOILER The movie has a good hook (three bored suburbanites try to become crooks) and the plot twist at the end is a decent idea (while running a job predestined to fail, the boss robs the boys blind), but the writing is pretty weak and the directing worse. ENDSPOILERI am actually glad Owen Wilson made it into the business as a comedic actor, but I can see why he hasn't written another film.I don't recommend this movie, unless you are really bored, are a big Wilson Brother's fan, and like to have a movie running while you clean the house.Bubba Joe Louis "},{"Title":"Best movie ever, man.","Date":"17 November 2004","Score":"0 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Crime, Drama","Review":" This movie is excellent, as are all 3 Wes Anderson movies.

It's refreshing to watch a movie that doesn't have to slap you upside the head with the humor. You have to be intelligent to get it. Many who have commented about this movie say they loved it, but they recognize it caters to a certain type of humor. I personally think that if you didn't think this movie was funny, you just need to go watch it again, because you probably missed everything. Wes Anderson uses a subtle humor which is easy to miss if you're used to the regular humor. However, unlike most movies, this is one that is funnier every time you watch it.

These would-be heist artists fizzle out just about as quickly as a bottle rocket does. The whole film comes across as either a very, very good college project, or as a somewhat amateurish low-budget independent film. It is both, made by Anderson and the Wilson brothers, friends from college. It is nowhere near as interesting or creative as Robert Rodriguez' low-budget El Mariachi. However, I was, for the most part, entertained by its 90 minutes' run time. The love story between Luke Wilson's character and the maid at the cheap motel was cute, because how often does a man passing through town fantasize about a cute maid? And the bumbled attempt at robbing the meat plant, partly because their crack safe-cracker didn't really know how to crack safes. Or the fact that real criminal played by James Caan was stealing all the furniture from one of their homes while they were attempting the robbery.Know all those slick heist films where everything works out right and the crooks get away with it?  Well, Bottle Rocket is just the opposite. Nothing ever goes quite right. Enjoy it for its zaniness, but not much else.
