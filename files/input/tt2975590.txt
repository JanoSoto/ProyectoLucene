First of all, I was a bit skeptical about this movie, and thought the runtime (about 2 and a half hours) was way too long (and I wasn&#x27;t completely wrong though). The action scenes were better than what we saw in the trailer. Although the doomsday scenes had terrible CGI (you&#x27;ll know it when you&#x27;ll see it), but overall I was happy. The movie had a lot crazy-packed action (it was directed by Zack Snyder, what do ya expect?) but the plot didn&#x27;t know where it was going. A lot of scenes were a treat for me to see and I got goosebumps watching them. There was more to Jesse Eisenberg than what I saw (and hated, like most people) in the trailer. I made a bet to my friend that he&#x27;ll suck in the movie, guess I&#x27;ll have to pay up. He really WAS good. But just like any other movie, it&#x27;s not perfect and has flaws. You can see that Zack tried hard very hard to fit everything nicely into the movie, but over stuffing was bound to happen. Other than that, I think there are some fan-boys who&#x27;ll be satisfied no matter how bad the movie is. Hope my review didn&#x27;t give away any spoilers in any way whatsoever, and that you end up enjoying the movie as much as (or more than) I did. </p>"},{"Title":"<h2>A much greater improvement on MOS 5X better.</h2>","Date":"<small>19 March 2016</small>","Score":"<small>1009 out of 1782 people found the following review useful:</small>","Review":"<p> I am drawn back to when this movie was first announced and how I despised the notion of a Batman V Superman film a la Freddy vs Jason, Alien vs Predator and so on. It all seemed like a huge gimmick to me and I expected the worst for this movie. Fast forward a couple years, I am sitting down at a private screening, the lights go down and the movies opens up. The opening sequence was not what I expected but shows Snyder&#x27;s visual creativity in a similar manner as he did with the opening sequence of Watchmen. <br><br>We are hearkened to the Black Zero Event, only we see it from Bruce Wayne&#x27;s perspective as shown in some of the trailers. I love that Snyder uses Bruce&#x27;s as the eyes of the audience to get an outside perspective of the surrounding madness and destruction, and he does it very effectively. You are mad at these beings, you feel the terror, the confusion the anger for them bringing there war here, it plays out with spectacle and sadness. <br><br>I had reported a rumor about Scoot Macnairy&#x27;s characters months back and was called out by Ocelot and others several times on things I reported, well turns out it was true. Something tragic happens at the hearing and it is our insight of how cunning and vicious this Lex Luthor is. <br><br>The overall story is well woven and much better than MOS, you can definitely breathe a sigh of relief in that Terrio does a great job of crafting this all together. The movie is a visual tour de force as we have come to expect with Snyder but let me just say that his directing has also improved. For those who moaned about the shaky cam and muted colors, they will be pleased. Performance wise. EVERYONE does an outstanding job, the standouts to me were Affleck, Eissenberg and Gadot. I was not on the Ben, Gal, Jesse hate wagon, though I found Eissenberg&#x27;s casting questionable but I felt he had shown that he has some capable range of pulling it off. Affleck is Bruce Wayne, Affleck is Batman, talk about casting redemption. Similar to Reynolds, GL&#x3E;Deadpool. Affleck should no longer be bogged with complaints about Daredevil. <br><br>For those that hated on Gadot, suck it, she owns the role in every way possible, she really has stepped up her acting game as well. The woman has presence as Diana, grace and beauty and as Wonder Woman, she is truly a Goddess. People were moaning about Gail&#x27;s size, forget that nonsense, she proves she does not need bulking muscles to be a warrior and her fight scenes are exceptional, makes Faora look like she was waltzing. Eissenberg, well well well. Let me first say I thought the best versions of Luthor were from the Lois and Clark and Smalville TV shows but Jesse brings something totally new to the game. <br><br>Jesse plays his Luthor like a true devil. He is deceiving, manipulative, conniving, that line the Devil will do it, he is referring to himself to me. I could not help but see him like a Lucifer in his role and wondered if Jesse kind of based playing his character that way. Everyone else support wise was absolutely great. I do not want to write a long report of praises so let me see if I can cap off before getting on my flight. The fight set up was a little weak but boy the pay off was spectacular. Cavill I feel needs to step up a little more, granted he was wonderful but he was out shined. He needs to get beyond that distraught expression that he likes to use because he does it to death in this and I found that annoying. <br><br>The other member intro&#x27;s were great and will have you all pumped for the JLA, the Knightmare scene was horrific and impactful and made me smile like a little geek. The final fight was amazing. Never in a CBM have we seen anything like it, yes I said it NEVER and lastly, I will say the movie does end on a heart wrenching note but a wink in the end. I loved it gave it a 9 and looking forward to seeing it again next week. If you guys have any questions ask I am going to be on a plane for the next 6-7 hours so will try to respond. I may have exaggerated about it being 10X better than MOS but I will say 5X better. </p>"},{"Title":"<h2>Ben Affleck!!!</h2>","Date":"<small>19 March 2016</small>","Score":"<small>545 out of 922 people found the following review useful:</small>","Review":"<p> Affleck as Bruce Wayne/Batman was pure awesome and dark.

Nobody should really be surprised that he was good with&#xA0;the role considering he&#x27;s a solid actor, but I thought he was great. Versus Bale? That&#x27;s a interesting question, because Affleck&#xA0;definitely regards Batman as a permanent part of his persona, while in Nolan series he eventually doesn&#x27;t want Batman. In combat he&#x27;s pretty much everything everyone would hope for from a film with Batman. One comment on the latest BvS trailer said he fought like the Arkham video games from a&#xA0;scene they showed. That&#x27;s a good&#xA0;comparison. He&#x27;s incredible in fights. Also the way Snyder records him in action, you can actually see him fighting unlike the Nolan films, which I&#x27;d imagine would make many people happy. He also&#xA0;gets a chance to use his detective skills, do not worry. Also his relationship with Irons, who plays Alfred,&#xA0;is just wonderful in general. Irons was exceptional&#xA0;in the role&#xA0;(Its Jeremy Irons for Christ&#x27;s sake, of course he nailed the role) gets some witty lines and also gets pretty emotional later on.

Batman&#x27;s aggression towards Superman. 3/4th of this movie is dedicated to this. In fact Batman wants to KILL Superman. And finally, when the moment arrives, Batman stops because his mother&#x27;s first name is the same as Superman&#x27;s mother&#x27;s. And so they become the best of friends. Just like that.<br><br>2. People of earth&#x27;s distrust of Superman, due to the events from the first movie. This too runs through most of the movie, with Superman trying to earn some brownie points by saving a few people. The fact that there is a public hearing against him, indicates that people are not buying it. But in the end, after his supposed death, why does he a get a military/hero style funeral? Why is the country mourning? Did I miss something? Especially since there is confusion on what happened during the hearing.<br><br>3. The public hearing: This should have been a really powerful scene. If Superman were to concede, then he&#x27;d be answerable to the people and he would not get to be the hero we know he is. The same, if he did not concede. I was giddy with anticipation when this scene started and was immensely disappointed when the Senator starts mumbling. Zack Snyder took the path of least resistance.<br><br>- - - - - -<br><br>I guess after the writer&#x27;s gave up on the main ideas, they didn&#x27;t care about smaller plot points<br><br>- Superman has no remorse for the destruction he caused in the first movie. In the big fight he smashes Batman through a building causing the building to collapse. Ditto for Doomsday, smashes him in to a power plant of some sort. He is not even thinking about anyone&#x27;s safety.<br><br>- Just like in the first movie, there is an apocalypse level destruction. Superman himself contributes to some of it. Thousands are probably killed, but superman only saves Lois Lane<br><br>- Superman threatens Batman that he can easily kill Batman, twice. Sounds like a bully to me<br><br>- Batman STEALING from Lex Luthor so HE gets to exact revenge on Superman<br><br>- Batman uses guns, not to intimidate, but actually kill. He even dreams of gun battles.<br><br>- The govt. has Zod&#x27;s body and the ship for 2 years. Luthor comes up with the idea that since the ship has a bio-metric security, he can use Zod&#x27;s body to gain access. It did not cross anyone else&#x27;s mind<br><br>- One alien craft/tech is lying in the Indian Ocean for 2 years. No nation/military has claimed it. Local fishermen are freely swimming to it and breaking away pieces<br><br>- The all powerful Kryptonian key has no security what so ever. Anyone can use it. Even Lex Luthor. It only unlocks EVERYTHING, why should it be secure?<br><br>- Kryptonians have banned the technology to create Doomsday. It&#x27;s so dangerous, they decide not to remove it from the system but keep it, with so minimum security that it can be enabled with a simple voice command by a non-Kryptonian.<br><br>- There is no compelling reason behind Lex Luthor&#x27;s hatred towards Superman. How does he stand to gain or lose?<br><br>- There is no villain, purpose, motive or problem to solve in the story. Doomsday appears so that Zack Snyder can once again have a city-leveling battle.<br><br>- Why is Doomsday angry with Superman? Since he is made from Zod &#x26; Luthor&#x27;s genes, does anger/hatred towards someone pass through genes?<br><br>- When Batman steals the Kryptonite, it would have spoiled whatever Luthor had planned, but Luthor just eggs Superman to fight Batman like they were in cahoots. How does Luthor know what Batman has planned? How does he know about the battle royale. Has he read the comic?<br><br>- Why is Batman not suspicious of the other meta beings? Why does he think they are friendly and will help? And against what? Why does he think he will need their help? How come Luthor is in on this?<br><br>- Why does Luthor have well designed logos for each meta human? <br><br>- Why was wonder woman so concerned with being exposed? According to the photo, she had already revealed herself, in FULL COSTUME. So why the secrecy? And why come out of hiding when she sees lightening coming from the dome?

Why would anyone care about him?<br><br>- Superman stops the car chase. Literally allowing the bad guys to escape. He may not like Batman&#x27;s methods, but he couldn&#x27;t figure out if Batman&#x27;s giving a chase, he&#x27;s after bad guys?!<br><br>- In the midst of deafening destruction Superman can hear Lois Lane.

Batman and Superman are in a big screen film together for the first time in history. The result? A sloppy attempt at setting up the DC Universe. Batman v Superman has its moments though with great performances from almost every one and action that could rival Man of Steel, but it was difficult to not walk out of this film and feel overwhelmingly disappointed. For a film that finished filming over a year ago, you would think Zack Snyder and Warner Bros would make all the effort in the world to edit in and out the stuff that&#x27;s important and tighten the movie, but that isn&#x27;t the case. <br><br>It&#x27;s directed by the aforementioned Snyder and stars almost the entire Man of Steel cast along with Ben Affleck and Jeremy Irons as Batman and Alfred respectively. The performances are mostly great all around, including Amy Adams, who unfortunately felt out of place for most of the film. I have no problem with Adams&#x27; portrayal or the character of Lois Lane being in the film, but she was misused and overused here. She and General Swanwick from the first film have several small scenes that are used for us to find out more about Lex Luthor. But the problem is, it&#x27;s a good 15 minutes of the film that could have shaved down to 3 or 4 minutes worth of scenes.<br><br>Speaking of Lex Luthor, the casting of Jesse Eisenberg caused a big stew of controversy when it was first announced, and I think it was warranted. I&#x27;ve seen the film twice now and had different opinions both times. The first time I was entertained by Lex but also confused as to why they went the route they did with the character. The second time, I was annoyed by the performance and the over the top portrayal of what should be a menacing villain. A few scenes here and there had those classic Luthor aspects that I&#x27;ve loved from the animated series and films, but the tone they went with for Eisenberg&#x27;s performance just doesn&#x27;t work. There&#x27;s little humor in an incredibly dark film, and Lex seems like he&#x27;s from a completely different film. <br><br>The other big problem the film unfortunately has is its title and marketing. Most of the marketing material was well done and proposed &#x22;the greatest gladiator match in the history of man&#x22;, but the reality is that it&#x27;s merely 10 minutes of a 2 and a half hour film. The fight itself is phenomenal. It doesn&#x27;t hold a candle to the fight in the comic book/film &#x22;The Dark Knight Returns&#x22;, but it&#x27;s probably the best part of Batman v Superman. The focus was all over the place though. Everything from the fight onto the ending is good cinema, but man does it take a long time to get there. I actually sat in the theater saying to myself &#x22;I&#x27;m kind of bored right now&#x22;. How in the world does that happen in a superhero film, let alone a Batman film?<br><br>There are still plenty of great aspects to this film, however. Diane Lane has a few heart-warming and gut-wrenching scenes. Laurence Fishburne provides some good comic relief as the head of the Daily Planet, Perry White. Jeremy Irons gives us our most involved and bada** Alfred to date. Even Gal Gadot, another questionable casting choice, showed acting chops that I didn&#x27;t think she had here and got me excited for the Wonder Woman film next year. Which brings me to the weirdest part about my feelings about this film. As many problems as there are, it didn&#x27;t get me any less enthused for the future of the DCEU. Some few surprises in the film, tease Justice League which was neat. And I&#x27;m incredibly stoked for Ben Affleck&#x27;s solo Batman film. With that said, I don&#x27;t think I can get that excited for Justice League if Snyder still directs. I have to believe many of the directing and editing mistakes came from him. But perhaps even Warner Bros themselves needs to take some of the fault for giving Snyder too much reign? Another positive though was Hans Zimmer&#x27;s score, unsurprisingly. I loved the way him and Junkie XL managed to weave in Superman&#x27;s theme with the new haunting Batman theme.<br><br>Ben Affleck may very well be the definitive Batman. Everyone knew his Bruce Wayne would be great but his Batman does not disappoint. There are scenes which rival the action in the Arkham video games in terms of style, creativity, and fluidity. I couldn&#x27;t be more excited for Affleck to write, direct, and star in the solo film whenever it may come out.<br><br>I honestly can&#x27;t believe I&#x27;m sitting here typing an average review for a film that&#x27;s one of my most anticipated of all time, but I am. There are plenty moments of pure greatness here, but for every incredible scene, there&#x27;s an unnecessary or strange scene out of place.

Affleck&#x27;s Batman is AMAZING. His Bruce Wayne is not as cool and casual as Christian Bale&#x27;s but he doesn&#x27;t need to considering this is a relatively old Batman who has seen some very dark times. His partnership with Jeremy Irons adds some much needed lightness to the movie. Cavill delivered the dialogues during the fight scene with Batman in a near perfect way. Gal Gadot had a much bigger role to play than seen in the trailers. And Jesse was good in a complex way. Fans have to understand that his Luthor is not muscular as compared to what we have seen in previous Superman movies His Luthor is an evil genius who does a great job of pitting the two giants against each other. Jesse played the role to his strengths as he should have. Contrary to the popular perception(especially after the third trailer) that the whole movie was spoil-ed, the plot was way more deeper than we imagined. The only issues were a fight scene where CGI looked dull and maybe, just maybe a bit over stuffing.

This is a long movie that feels even longer. Ben Affleck does a GREAT job as Batman, that doesn&#x27;t mean I LOVED this Batman (I did not) but he does a great job and any problems there are with the character fall on the writer, producers and director. The problem with this Batman is no that he is brutish and violent and angry.. it&#x27;s that he&#x27;s not smart. He&#x27;s not strategic and intellectual , brilliant and a world class detective. He is consumed by anger, hatred, vengeance and brutality (and not in a good way).

Doomsday was sadly, a disaster. In the comic he is a Goliath , matching Superman&#x27;s physical might and that&#x27;s pretty much it. His punches are so powerful they shatter buildings (which Snyder seems to really, really, really like to do).. there was no need to alter him to the point they did.<br><br>This movie would have been better served had Lex made a clone from Zod&#x27;s body of Bizarro (makes more sense) and had it been only Batman and Superman, getting to know one another, learning about each other, discovering their differences and ultimately their similarities as they came together in the end to defeat a Superman level menace. After the credits , an email to Wonder Woman with Batman letting her know that he has discovered who she is. <br><br>You could even have had wonder woman in it, she was a delightful character (in this film) and I enjoyed her scenes (she gets little screen time but I felt was one of the best characters).

There was certain montage, where it should shown that he was, but i never felt that he was. This representation was too dark. This was also more of a batman movie with superman playing a small part in that, yet batman&#x27;s world is too dark for superman.

Zack Snyder, basically a more talented and flashier Michael Bay, taking over the DC Extended Universe and pinning two of the greatest superheros against each other. I wasn&#x27;t sure he could make it work. And I&#x27;m still not quite sure if he did. The reason I say that is because the movie is missing scenes. Like most of Snyder&#x27;s work, it was meant to be a rated R, three hour long movie, and in order for a wide release it had to be trimmed which means some crucial scenes were modified or cut completely, and you can tell. The editing is choppy, even frustrating at times, and the pacing is nonexistent. There aren&#x27;t any build ups. It just goes from exposition to AMAZINGNESS to exposition to BADASSERY to exposition to AWESOME HOLY SH*T EXPLOSIONS, etc. I won&#x27;t blame Snyder until I see his version so as of now I&#x27;d pin that on the writers and editors (if there were any editors because holy hell some of the cuts are atrocious). When the big moments come, like Clark Kent and Bruce Wayne&#x27;s first meeting, or Lex Luthor&#x27;s birthing of Doomsday, or hell when Batman and Superman finally go at it, they just happen. There&#x27;s no emotional weight attached to any of it. It&#x27;s freaking awesome to look at, but there&#x27;s no pathos to give it the extra oomph that pushes great movies into the extraordinary.<br><br>Having said that, Batman v Superman is highly entertaining. The action set pieces are gorgeous and the titular showdown is indeed awesome when it finally comes. The heroes themselves are amazing. Ben Affleck as Bruce Wayne is one of the most perfect choices in casting since Robert Downey Jr. as Iron Man. He IS Bruce Wayne. You never question it when he&#x27;s on screen. Henry Cavill is great as the man of steel. He doesn&#x27;t have much to work with but he shines when he needs to. And Gal Gadot as Wonder Woman steals the screen whenever she comes on. She&#x27;s perfect. And when these heroes come together to fight the common enemy, Doomsday, it&#x27;s truly a sight to behold. That is the main thing Dawn of Justice has over Man of Steel, the heroes. But while Man of Steel succeeded in the villain department with the commanding presence of General Zod, that is where Batman v Superman suffers most.<br><br>Jesse Eisenberg as Lex Luthor didn&#x27;t bother me as much as I thought it would honestly. For what he had to do, he was fine in the role. The problem is that the character is written as an obnoxious rich sociopath with a penchant for mayhem, so he&#x27;s basically in the shadows for a majority of the movie acting as a puppeteer to pit Superman against Batman. He poses no physical threat of any sort. Hell, seeing him stand next to Batman and Superman you can easily see either of them crushing him like the cockroach that he is. But there is something unsettling about his unassuming manner. The courtroom scene in particular is a chilling one, and his rooftop monologue actually hits all the right beats and he borders on threatening. Again, it&#x27;s less against Eisenberg and more on how the script wanted the character to be. Doomsday is fine also. The only reason he exists is to have an epic fight in the third act and it delivers, but as a character he&#x27;s just... an anti-character. That&#x27;s exactly what he is actually. The antithesis of Superman - a godless killing machine, a creature with no conscience, an unkillable force of nature. So he served his purpose, but there was no charismatic villain for me to be rooting for (or against). It&#x27;s just a waiting game for the heroes to get into action.<br><br>The movie is also too long. Mind you, a sh*tload of stuff is crammed into the two and a half hours to warrant the runtime, but a few subplots could&#x27;ve been scrapped and the movie would&#x27;ve been better for it. I feel like if a good editor swept through the movie, trimmed the fat, put all the pieces in the right place and kept it at a tight two hours, Batman v Superman could be one of the greatest superhero movies ever made. As of now, it&#x27;s a beautifully fun mess. Entertaining as all hell but lacking in depth. And again, Zack Snyder&#x27;s ultimate cut may be the perfect superhero movie, but we&#x27;ll just have to wait and see. <br><br>Which brings me to my main point, and that&#x27;s Batman v Superman is a comic book movie. It&#x27;s meant to entertain. Dissecting it and critiquing it as a piece of cinema is too easy and is an exercise in futility really, which is why I dismiss most of the critic reviews claiming it&#x27;s a cinematic disaster when its entire premise is based around fantasy and the absurd. It&#x27;s incredibly fun, and that&#x27;s all it&#x27;s supposed to be. The fact that it has some truly awe-inspiring moments and intermittently amazing dialogue is just icing on the cake. Batman v Superman is a flawed movie, no doubt about it, but it accomplishes what it sets out to. It gives us Batman versus Superman. It gives us the dawn of the Justice League. It gives us a big screen adaptation of Lex Luthor and a juggernaut of a villain in Doomsday. All the pieces are there. The question is whether or not you&#x27;re willing to shut off your brain and sit back and enjoy the comic book epicness happening on screen. If you are, then Batman v Superman is an absolute must-watch thrill ride. If not, then why on earth are you seeing a Zack Snyder film in the first place? </p>"},{"Title":"<h2>The Dark Avengers</h2>","Date":"<small>21 March 2016</small>","Score":"<small>469 out of 907 people found the following review useful:</small>","Review":"<p> What would happen if Avengers were darker and grimmer? This movie is your answer. I will not say that is the best Comic Book Movie ever, but is very good. For those who dislike Man of Steel, BvS is so much better, a big improvement. The writing of the movie is wonderful and we see that Terrio is a guy with a great intellectual baggage, even when writing a super hero movie. Each character seems to give his point of view about the world with their dialogues about a superpowered alien.I don&#x27;t know how the professional critics will react, because they have embraced the way of Marvel-Disney regarding super hero movies, so i ask to you to forget MU while watching the film. Despite this, you will end the movie thinking that it is a darker, better writing and more complex Avengers movie. The movie is amazing, and i hope you enjoy it. </p>"}]
