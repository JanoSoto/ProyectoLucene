[{"Title":"Disturbing and powerful film","Date":"6 May 2000","Score":"175 out of 221 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Biography, Drama, Romance","Review":"  This is a poignant and powerful film.  It is the true story of Teena Brandon, a young woman who is in the throes of a sexual identity crisis. She cuts her hair and dresses like a man to see if she can pass for one. What starts out as an experiment turns into a full fledged alter ego as she is accepted as a man by a group she meets in a bar.  The story follows the group's escapades, including Brandon's love affair with Lana, who falls in love with Brandon, thinking she's a man.  It culminates with the discovery that Brandon is actually a woman with a dramatic confrontation in the finale.This is film noir at it's finest.  A lot of people think that this is a story about courage and lesbianism but it is really about neither.  It is about the search for identity; not just sexual identity but the search for a deeper self .  All the characters in this film were lost and confused, but Brandon was the only one who realized it of herself.  The rest were basically playing out their despondent lives trying not to think of who or what they were.  Here was a person they loved and accepted, but who turned out to be the most heinous of deviants as defined by their own prejudices and fears. This is why they were so fundamentally shaken upon the revelation of Brandon's true identity.  It left them to confront their own flimsy identities.  They were left with no respite from the emotional vortex. Brandon presented a terrifying threat to the way they viewed themselves. They were compelled to change who they were or hate someone they had grown to love.This film was also about obsession.  Brandon takes extraordinary risks to live the male role, not out of courage, but out of an obsession to know and understand it, and to see if she can find comfort and a sense of belonging. Likewise, writer/director Kimberly Peirce had been obsessed with this story and researched it for five years before finally making the film.  Obsession generally leads to one of two places greatness or death.  For Peirce, at least for the moment, it has lead to greatness in the production of this film.Strictly from a technical directorial standpoint there was nothing special here.  The lighting was amateurish, the shots were mostly mundane. The sets and locations were realistically trashy, but it is a lot easier to create realistic trash than realistic elegance.  Peirce also bogs the film down occasionally with excessive character development.  However, Peirce captures in the story and the filming, the essence of rural lower class crudenes, bigotry and hatred and fear.  It is the raw emotion that reaches out and grabs us.  Her lens brought into sharp focus the base reality of inescapable despair and deluded hope.  Reality often has fangs, and Peirce was undaunted in showing them and then ripping us to shreds.As to Hilary Swank, I can only add one more rose to the bouquet of praise that has been heaped on her.  If there was any courage in this story, it was the courage of Swank to take such a complex and disturbing role.  The subtlety of her performance was astounding.  She needed not just to be a woman playing a man.  She needed to be a woman playing a woman playing a man, trying to look convincing yet insecure and unsure of how she was being perceived by the other characters.  When in character, her many skillful lapses into moments of femininity, only to snap back into masculinity were masterfully done.  For Swank, this was a meteoric rise from obscurity.  It remains to be seen if it was just the perfect alignment of actor and role, or something more.  I hope for the latter and look forward to seeing her next project.Greatly obscured by Swankmania, was the performance by Chloe Sevigny as Lana, Brandon's love interest.  She gave an outstanding performance in another extraordinarily difficult role.  Her conflict over the implications of her sexual and emotional feelings for Brandon were sensitively and delicately portrayed.  She played the part with a tentative eagerness, just as one would expect of someone whose sexual identity had been thrown into upheaval.  It was also no easy career choice to be cast in a role with so many explicit sexual scenes with another woman.This film was stark reality with no holds barred.  The filmmaking was technically unsophisticated (and I'm usually a real stickler about that), but I rated it a 9/10 on pure emotional power.  This film is not for you if you are offended by lesbianism, graphic violence or profanity.  But if you are not intimidated by the naked reality of the darker side of life, this is a film you must experience.

Get it at Amazon.)This movie really made me think about sexual differences and what it means to have a sex change or to want one, or to be trapped in a gender you don't want. It was very effective to have us see Hilary Swank (who plays Brandon Teena/Teena Brandon) with short hair and male facial expressions and gestures without giving us a glimpse of her as Teena. (Actually we did get a brief glimpse in a photo.) Swank looks like a boy, acts like a boy, in fact works hard to be a boy; indeed that is (sadly) part of what this movie is about, what it means to be a boy in middle America as opposed to being a girl. And then when we have the scene with the tampons and the breast wrapping and we see her legs, the effect is startling, an effect possibly lost on those who knew that the person playing Brandon was a woman. It was when I saw her legs and could tell at a glance that she was a woman with a woman's legs that I realized just how subtle, but unmistakable are the anatomical sexual differences, and how convincing Swank's portrayal was.I was reminded as I watched this of being a young person, of being a teenager and going through all the rituals and rites, unspoken, unplanned, without social sanction, that we all go through to prove our identity, because that is what Brandon was so eager to do, to prove his identity as a boy. I thought, ah such an advantage he has with the girls because he knows what they like and what they want. He can be smooth, and how pretty he looks. It was strange. I actually knew some guys in my youth who had such talent, and the girls did love them.The direction by Kimberly Peirce is nicely paced and the forebodings of horror to come are sprinkled lightly throughout so that we don't really think about the resolution perhaps until the campfire scene in which John Lotter shows his self-inflicted scars and tosses the knife to Brandon. Then we know for sure, something bad is going to happen.Hilary Swank is very convincing. Her performance is stunning, and she deserved the Academy Award she won for Best Actress. She is the type of tomboy/girl so beloved of the French cinema, tomboyish, but obvious a girl like, for example, Zouzou as seen in Chloe in the Afternoon (1972) or Ã‰lodie Bouchez in the The Dreamlife of Angels (1998), or many others. Indeed, one is even reminded of Juliette Binoche, who of course can play anything, or going way back, Leslie Caron in Gigi (1958). Chloe Signvey, who plays Lana Tisdel, the girl Brandon loves, whom I first saw in Palmetto (1998), where she stole a scene or two from Woody Allen and Elisabeth Shue, really comes off ironically as butch to Swank, yet manages a sexy, blue collar girl next door femininity. She also does a great job. Peter Sarsgaard is perfect as John Lotter, trailer trash car thief and homophobic redneck degenerate.Very disturbing is the ending. If you know the story, you know the ending. Just how true this was to the real life story it is based on is really irrelevant. I knew nothing about the story, but I know that film makers always take license to tell it the way they think it will play best, and so it's best to just experience the film as the film, independent of the real story, which, like all real stories, can never be totally told.Obviously this is not for the kiddies and comes as close to an X rating as any R movie you'll ever see. It will make most viewers uncomfortable, but it is the kind of story that needs to be told.

In our most honest moments, we can all acknowledge aspects of our own lives and personalities that we don't understand, that we would love to change and that often make us feel alienated from the `norm' of society at large.  In the case of Teena Brandon &#150; a young man `trapped' in a woman's body - the anomaly happens to be a more pronounced and certainly less socially acceptable one than most of us are forced to endure in our lives. And she paid the ultimate price society demands from those it fears and does not understand  she was murdered in Nebraska in 1993, simply for being `different.'The film builds a convincing case for compassionate understanding without converting Brandon into a saint-like figure.  Not only do we witness the petty criminality of her life, but we see her propensity for duplicity and deception, a personality trait that actually leads in part to many of the troubles she encounters, playing a crucial role to a large extent even in her death itself.  Yet, given society's out-of-hand rejection of transgendered people, what real options but a life of dishonesty is Brandon really given?  Similarly, Lana, the young woman with whom Brandon falls in love and the one person who has ever accepted Brandon unconditionally for what she is, suffers from a number of her own demons.Credit writer/director Kimberly Pierce and co-writer Andy Bienen for not taking the easy commercial path of reducing the moral complexities of the personalities involved to a black-and-white world where good and evil are displayed in neatly arranged patterns for our easy consumption.  There are many times in this  film when literally none of the people we are involved with are the slightest bit appealing.  The filmmakers, in their faith in our maturity, ask us to go along on a pretty harrowing journey at times, but it is one that leads us to a very rewarding destination.  The scenes in which Brandon's companions expose her secret is riveting and terrifying in its dramatic intensity and human sadness.  The utter humiliation Brandon is forced to endure at the hands of the hooligans who are tormenting her broadens to become a symbolic representation of every person who has suffered such an injustice at the hands of unreasoning ignorance for whatever reason.  It is a chilling reminder of the danger of the mob mentality unrestrained by empathy and enlightenment.Like so many of the best off-Hollywood independent productions,  `Boys Don't Cry' finds its truth in two crucial elements  the canny depiction of  the bleak sterility and stifling provincialism of its Midwest setting  and the uniformly first-rate performances by a largely unknown set of actors.Hilary Swank, in her Oscar-winning turn as Brandon, and Chloe Sevigny as Lana achieve a naturalism in their portrayals that neutralizes any theatricality that might have robbed the film of its indispensable quality of immediacy and believability.  They convert what might, in less capable hands, have become little more than a sensationalized freak show into a powerful and understandable drama about real, thoroughly recognizable human beings.  For that alone, `Boys Don't Cry' becomes a cinematic experience impossible to forget  "},{"Title":"A Moving Piece of Filmmaking.","Date":"2 December 2000","Score":"101 out of 134 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Biography, Drama, Romance","Review":"  Boys Don't Cry was a major success with the critics and the Academy Award's, so I looked forward to seeing it. Easily one of the best films of the past year, Boys Don't Cry is a moving experience that deserved all the credit it got, and then some.The film takes for its source material the true story of Brandon Teena (Hilary Swank), a girl who, well, just wants to be a boy. A sex-changing (getting her hair cut and sticking a dildo down her pants) credit sequence sees our hero(ine) at first on the pull, duping a local girl into a bit of nookie, and then on the run, when the truth about her sexuality rears its bizarre head. A fugitive of the law, as well as a few irate townsfolk, a twist of fate leads to her befriending a bunch of trailer-trash misfits and, temporarily, enjoying a new-found freedom under her manly guise. Of course, it's all going to go horribly wrong - particularly when she falls in love with the local girlie sweetheart (Chloe Sevigny).Chloe Sevigny, who plays the girl Brandon falls in love with, deserved to win an Academy Award. Her performance still lives in my memory, and it has been some time since I first saw Boys Don't Cry. Hilary Swank, who did receive an Oscar, pulls off an absolute barnstormer of a performance as Brandon Teena, it is easily one of the boldest and most memorable performances I saw in the 20th century. Kimberley Pierce is also another stand-out, she is in the director's chair, and she hardly got any praise for her amazing effort that she put into this film. I applaud everyone involved in Boys Don't Cry, even the one's who got little credit, particularly Brendan Sexton III (who plays a trouble-making misfit) and Andy Bienen (co-writer).Groundbreaking performances and a brilliant debut directing effort make this film unmissable.I rate Boys Don't Cry 9 out of 10.

It tells the true and tragic story of Teena Brandon/Brandon Teena, a woman living as a man in a small town in Nebraska. No matter what your personal opinions may be, this film does not preach. It tells the story in a matter-of-fact, honest and gritty way, but leaves you shaking your head in shock that such anger and hatred exists in these modern times, for someone who is different merely because of their sexual preference.Relative newcomer Hilary Swank gives a heartfelt and courageous performance as Brandon. I say courageous not only because of the subject matter, but also because she is able to strip away her youthful, movie star glamour and become the character she plays. She is entirely convincing. Also, she shows a tremendous amount of guts for being able to get through the gut-wrenchingly violent rape scene. This was a brave choice, and a wise one.Chloe Sevigny plays Lana, the girl Brandon loves. She is the only person who truly understands Brandon. Brandon finds himself in a world of drunken trailer trash and convicted felons. No one is free from guilt, but there is always the unspoken sin of being different. Hilary Swank and Chloe Sevigny play their tastefully erotic love scenes without seeming self-conscious. So many actors of their generation might be afraid to tackle these types of roles, but they do their jobs with aplomb.The film was another that haunted me the day after seeing it. Kimberly Peirce manages to make a simple film about a very difficult subject, and she doesn't resort to Hollywood gloss or preachiness. It is a risky film, very difficult to watch in places, with several very violent and disturbing scenes. It is a story that needs to be told, and with the two Oscar-nominated performances from Ms. Swank and Ms. Sevigny, it succeeds. "},{"Title":"WOW!

When I had heard that Hilary Swank won the Best Actress Oscar for this film, I had to put it on my must-see list.  As it turned out, the film came out on video just three days before I had to go back to my station in Japan.  All I really knew about the film was that it was based on a true story about a woman who lived his life and as a man and was brutally raped and murdered in 1993.  That's all I knew, and after watching this film I couldn't believe my eyes.  Out of all the true stories that Hollywood has put on film, this stands out, mostly because of its disturbingly honest presentation and unforgettable performances that even the real-life characters that there based on even said how real they were.  Like the same year's OCTOBER SKY (which got #2 on my Ten Best List) the story is dramatized, filmmaking-wise, but it dare doesn't turn away from being an unforgettable potrayal of a truly unique and unfairly misjudged human being. The story originates in Lincoln, Nebraska, 1993 which is where Brandon Teena came from.  We discover early on that Brandon is a female that develops a sexual identity crisis and becomes a male, and eventually becomes one of the most desired guys in Nebraska.  We also learn that Brandon, under the name of Teena, has been criminally charged several times, most notably for grand theft auto.  Moving to Falls City, Brandon strikes up a friendship with circle of aimless residents, including Candice, a single mother who works as a bartender, John Lotter and Tom Nissen, a couple of guys who've served time for various reasons, and finally Lana Tisdel, a girl who Brandon falls in love with.  The bulk of the film showcases Brandon and Lana's growing relationship, and first-time co-writer/director Kimberly Pierce handles this so beautifully despite the addition of a graphic sex scene, which the real Lana Tisdel reports never happened.  Eventually, Brandon's new friends soon discover he is not who he says he his, and eventually becomes the victim of a hate crime. Pierce makes the story so compelling from the beginning that the film doesn't become a simple cross-dressing tale but of a powerful examination of a human being who was just different and also of the friends that he made who just wouldn't accept him for who he really was (all of them except for Lana, who surprisingly does).   The haunting theme The Bluest Eyes in Texas, sung by Nina Persson and Nathan Larson, also adds perfect punctuation.  Still, what really makes this sleeper praiseworthy are the performances, starting with Hilary Swank's moving, perfectly tuned potrayal of Brandon, who recieved the well-deserved Best Actress, as well as a long list of other honors.  Chloe Sevigny, who I've fallen in love with in every film I've seen her in (from her breakout role as an AIDS victim in the controversial 1995 film KIDS, to her shy and smart lead character in last year's underrated THE LAST DAYS OF DISCO) shines as Lana, and has won a score of acting honors as well.  Peter Sarsgaard and Brendan Sexton III are fine as the antagonists John and Tom, and finally Jeanette Arnette is great in a smallish role as Lana's mother who, of course, turns the other way at her daughter's new boyfriend.Although some viewers may be turned off at the high volume of profanity and rape sequences, this film should be given a chance if not only for the fact of it being a true story, but also for it's respect to a unique and unfairly misjudged human being who didn't live his life to the fullest.

Those definitions are disrespectful and very reductive. Boys Don't Cry is one of the most gripping and brutal dramas ever made, and it stands the test of time thanks to its audacity and its brilliant central performance, courtesy of the heartbreaking Hilary Swank.Swank stars as Teena Brandon, a 20-year old girl from Lincoln, Nebraska, who's right in the middle of a sexual identity crisis (her own words). This crisis causes her some trouble with the law, and she decides to run away, more specifically to Falls City. Once there, she starts a new life, with a new name (Brandon Teen), a new haircut and socks down her pants. It's under these circumstances that she meets Lana (Chloe Sevigny), who will begin a passionate relationship with Brandon, unaware of his real nature. But what's gonna happen when the truth leaks out?On the surface, Boys Don't Cry could sound like a simple lesbian flick, but that would be like saying American History X is just about skinheads. True, this film is about love, but it's also a careful, unflinching study of identity, hope and fear. The last one plays a significant part in the third act, as some of the characters' (most notably John, cunningly played by Peter Sarsgaard) fear of something they don't understand will have tragic consequences.Director Kimberly Peirce tells this painful true story without judging anyone, so that the performances can speak for themselves Swank is staggering in a role rivaled only by her equally tear-inducing turn in Million Dollar Baby (she deservedly won an Oscar for both performances). She makes Brandon appear like a human being, not a freak, and that makes her story even more uncomfortable to watch in certain parts. The supporting players excel as well, Sevigny (who was Oscar-nominated for the role of Lana) and Sarsgaard delivering the first of many riveting contributions to independent cinema.Consistently moving, occasionally hard to watch (there's a rape scene which might upset the weak of stomach), Boys Don't Cry is a daring, powerful effort that demands to be seen. And despite its title, it's very likely to make all audiences shed a tear, no matter the gender or inclination. This is a movie that won't leave you indifferent.

Swank does not have to persuade us, the viewers, that she is a male. We know she is Hilary Swank, actress. What she has to do is persuade us that her character can fool the other characters in the movie that she is a guy. This I never bought for even a flashing moment.Given her small hands, slight build, delicate features, and female voice, I am certain Brandon (Swank) would have been 'clocked', or outed, in a few seconds, both by men and by women. I never for one moment believed she could have fooled a soul, let alone a girl-friend and some beer-buddies. This, of course, is the ruination of the film's power for me. Also, it is the total depreciation of Swank's character for me.That said, that the critical linchpin of the story was a farce for me, the movie sinks into the realm of disbelief. Further, I found neither the rape scene nor the murder scene shocking or particularly repulsive. Just another instance of movie violence.I have used the term 'for me' quite often in this review.

But movies like Boys Don't Cry won't be the catalyst that brings this change in heart about. Here is a film that manages to be as repugnant as the tragedies it depicts. It is filled with exceptionally well-played characters, not one of which is at all likable. Brandon, (portrayed wonderfully by Hilary Swank) the proverbial man trapped inside a woman's body, is undoubtedly intended as the story's protagonist, but aside from the love he feels for Lana (another fine performance from Chloe Sevigny), he possesses no admirable characteristics; he is profoundly stupid in the choices he makes, and doesn't seem to realize just how precarious his position is. He's a sheep surrounded by a pack of wolves but is either too naive or too lovestruck to notice. His constant run-ins with the authorities certainly don't make things much easier. The rest of the characters are your stereotypical Midwest lowlifes their activities consist of drinking, smoking, and working dead-end jobs. It is not at all difficult to predict what will ultimately happen to Brandon in an environment such as this.

For a first time director Kimberly Pearce has created an amazing film that is all about what is wrong and what is right in the world.

Yes, it is shocking, and brutal and violent, and sure, you may want to turn away in certain scenes.

Actually, I watched the film before informing myself here on IMDb and should have done it, apparently, to understand it better. If you watch the film without any background information, you are thrown in cold in a person's life and destiny that is completely unbelievable, unlikely and utterly disturbing. Here actually lies my point of criticism This movie does NOT explain, WHY Brandon is like he/she is. Where does this condition come from, what has happened to her/him? The film should have started earlier to put us in the picture. It would have been much more convincing, had we been given the chance to see a more feminine character first. Or get some sort of empathy. For a person with normal sexual orientation, it is virtually impossible to relate to Brandon's behaviour, in my humble opinion. I was left shaking my head more than once thinking a person behaving like that calls for trouble. Why couldn't Brandon have been more discreet? Why so blatantly offend those small-town hillbillies? He/she must have known that stupid country people cannot relate to persons behaving otherwise than according to fixed, pre-established behavioural patterns. In a big city you do what you want, but in the countryside, stay low-key, for heaven's sake.Aside from this, Hilary Swank's performance was astounding and small wonder she won a deserved Oscar. I consider Hilary Swank to be one of the most beautiful women in the world, by the way.

I was unaware of the story at the time and went home to watch it straight away. For the next two hours I was totally moved and disturbed by this true story. Hilary Swank (Million Dollar Baby) plays a transgendered woman Teena Brandon, who cuts her hair, dresses as a guy and goes by the name of Brandon Teena. After been saved in a bar room brawl by volatile John (Peter Sarsgaard), Brandon takes up his new friend's offer of a trip to Falls City, Nebraska, accompanied by John's mates Tom (Brendan Sexton III) and Candice. A devastating decision.There he is introduced to another friend of John's, lonely trailer trash Lana (Chloe Sevigny)- a girl who is bored with her life. Brandon becomes a popular new addition to group and soon he and Lana (unaware of his true gender) fall for each other and enter into a sexual relationship. Following a minor traffic offence, Brandon's true identity is revealed and events take a dramatic turn. Furious at Brandon's lies, Tom and John strip him to prove to Lana that he is a woman. They then proceed to kidnap Brandon and rape him. Brandon reports the rape to the police, who are less than sympathetic, and retreats to Candice's house where he plans to stay the night. Despite being revealed as a woman, Lana demonstrates her love for Brandon by visiting Brandon at the house. There they spend the night together and agree to runaway. However, when Lana goes to collect her belongings she discovers John and Tom, in an attempt to cover up the rape, setting out to find Brandon. The film ends with Brandon and Candice being brutally murdered at the hands of their former friends, leaving Lana devastated at her lover's side.This film is incredibly effective, if a little factually incorrect. The last half an hour (following Brandon's reveal) is very graphic making it an extremely powerful piece of film making that is hard to watch. The love story between Brandon and Lana is touching and yet there is always a feeling of impending doom lurking. Hilary Swank's Oscar was most certainly well deserved. She is totally believable as the charismatic young man Brandon, yet you are always aware of his vulnerability, particularly following the horrific rape. Chloe Sevigny, Brendan Sexton III and the superbly menacing Peter Sarsgaard are also exceptional in their supporting roles and deserve as much credit as Swank. Be warned, this film is not for everybody, especially those who are easily affected- the language and sexual content is explicit. However, I would advised anybody over 18 to watch it(keep in mind it is a true story) and I defy you not to be moved.

It's a story about courage, strength, love. Not only because of the strong sexuality and violence, but also because of its serious thematics and the way it treats these subjects, Boys Don't Cry is the strongest film of '99.The story, which has been shocking many people, is about a girl named Teena Brandon (Hilary Swank) who dresses like and considers herself a boy, and changes her name for Brandon Teena. After some trouble in his town, Brandon meets a group of people and go with them to Falls City, in Nebraska. There his life will change even more, specially after he meets Lana (Chloe Sevigny), a girl who is tired of her life. Many things will happen, and I'm not able to tell this here, even this being a true story.What is special in this film is that we forget that it is based on real life. And this is because of the amazing performance by Hilary Swank. I was quite unsure if she deserved to win the Oscar, because she was competing with Annette Bening and Julianne Moore! But she won, and now I can understand why. The film has many qualities, but it wouldn't have been so good without Hilary. It is one of the best female performances of the '90s. But Chloe Sevigny shouldn't be forgotten. She is worth of as much recognition as Ms. Swank, in a very difficult role too.With a great film editing and a very well written screenplay, Boys Don't Cry is a must-see. However, it is not for everyone. Some scenes can shock many people, and people who are not mature enough shouldn't see it.When the film ends, we get back to reality and realize that it was all true. It's so sad, unfair and absurd how things like that happen because of a dirty feeling. It gives a great discussion about how truly unfair and ugly inside some people are.

Simply put, the idea behind this film doesn't interest me much and that is the reason for me not bothering to finally see the film. However, now that I have seen it, I don't know why I waited so long; Boys Don't Cry is an excellent film. As rich in themes and life lessons as it is compelling, the film works on a number of levels and is topped off by a truly excellent cast of young performers that give it their all and help to ensure that Boys Don't Cry is the success that it so richly deserves to be. The film follows the intriguing, and oddly true, story of Brandon Teena, or rather Teena Brandon; a girl who is in the midst of a gender identity crisis and decides to live her life as a boy. After finding a young man and woman in a bar, Brandon quickly finds herself on her way to a small town in Nebraska, where she quickly becomes friends with the locals...all the while harbouring her secret.When it comes to good films that are directed by women, there isn't many to list; but Boys Don't Cry is certainly one that belongs towards the top of that short list. Kimberly Peirce excellently directs the film, and after viewing her past filmography it is evident that Peirce was very dedicated to this story as she produced a short film version of it in 1995. While Peirce's direction stands out, it is certainly not the star of the show, as that accolade falls to the scintillatingly brilliant Hilary Swank. Swank picked up an Oscar for her performance in this movie, and that momentous event represents one of the few times that the Academy has given the award to the right person. The central role of this movie is the sort of role that every performer wants to get as it allows them to really get their teeth into it, and that is certainly what Swank does. The rest of the cast also does well in their roles, with ChloÃ« Sevigny and Peter Sarsgaard being the standouts among them.Every scene in the movie is rich with substance and double meaning, and as we spend the whole movie getting acquainted with the various parties; what happens at it's conclusion is both shocking and heart-breakingly tragic. The way that the film pulls off it's climax is skilfully handled, and it's also detached enough for the audience to make their own mind up about, which beats the sickening thickly laid substance approach that so many films latch onto. The substance emancipates from the girl wanting to be the other sex, but if you look deeper into the film, it is not just this element that lends it substance. The meaning of Boys Don't Cry can be stretched to any and all moments in life when you're not the person you want to be, and the story while tragic and shocking, is ultimately uplifting, which only adds more confusion to the already potent cocktail of emotions that Boys Don't Cry forces you into. If, like I was, you aren't watching this film because it's subject doesn't appeal to you; you should book your ideas up. There is something for everyone in this compelling drama.

It certainly reminds you of how horrible the world can be, and how cruel and narrow-minded people are. I couldn't stop thinking about it for days.Everybody should see this film. This is the kind of film where it doesn't really matter if the lighting is perfect or if the art direction is good or if the camera angles are correct, because this film has got such an important message. However, it just so happens that this film also has good lighting and camera work etc. Everything about this film shows the pain and the fear, the loneliness and it really shows how much we are willing to do just to be accepted, and to be loved. I am so happy Hilary Swank got an Oscar for this, because she is Excellent!We must never stop fighting for what is right, and we have to start accepting people. Making other people feel bad won't make you feel good. Hitting back is not going to stop the pain from the first punch. This films won't leave anyone feeling nothing, it really touches you.

One wonders too whether some viewers were voting their personal discomfort with the protagonist's problems with sexual identity, rather than assessing a movie. Hilary Swank's is a truly exceptional performance gut-wrenchingly real, winning you over with her stunning ability to create a living character that is so real one forgets that one is watching fiction. The fiction is merely apparent in this case. The writing and direction too is superlative. There are only 2 problems with Boys Don't Cry 1) it is so convincing that it is truly upsetting to watch. 2) it's hard for Swank to go anywhere other than down in terms of performance. Having watched her last night in the also excellent Million Dollar Baby, attempting to assess her work for me is very difficult; one can't help comparing her performance to BDC and finding yourself thinking that she hasn't had to produce that much out of her locker. The fault is mine, I'm sure, not Swank's. In short, though, Boys Don't Cry, a film that got almost no release in the UK, is one of the most under-known and underrated movie in recent times.CT "},{"Title":"Tough !","Date":"10 January 2001","Score":"5 out of 8 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Biography, Drama, Romance","Review":"  A weird and squalid story ? A terrible and true story ! Teena Brandon really existed and lived as Brandon Teena. All is shown in this film is about nothing but truth, Kimberly Peirce (and her co-screen-writer Andy Bienen) invented nothing, only changed Candace's name (actually Lisa Lambert)... Strictly relying on a documentary, The Brandon Teena Story (Susan Muska and Greta Olafsdottir, 1998), the director sticks to Teena Brandon's terrible story to the letter. To such an extent that Lana Tisdel (the real Lana) withdrew the complaint she had lodged against the film (driven to do it by her family, after having helped to the script writing). When she watched the film, she could do nothing but ascertain its accuracy... BOYS DON'T CRY is a sensational film. Some viewers hate it maybe. Those highly disturbed by Teena Brandon's story, those who maybe identify with her/his pathetic persecutors and murderers. A film which clashes with its audience head-on, which leaves it flabbergasted and which is food for thought. We are confronted with one of the worst examples of intolerance and stupidity, with brute savagery Man is sadly able too often. The certainty that there will be no happy end creates a tension which quickly takes hold of the viewer without giving him a break. The final half-hour explodes to our faces, the director doesn't spare us any violence. One may wonder whether Brandon's rape sequence (by John and Brendan), exposed in such full details on the screen, was really necessary or not. Maybe an ellipsis showing only Brandon's swollen face in the vile sheriff's office, forced to tell his/her rape would have been just as well. Maybe, one can argue about that... On the other hand, the sequence in which the two freaks force Brandon (with physical violence again) to expose her real sexual gender is obvious, in spite of the hardly bearable and physical disgust we can feel watching it... Kimberly Peirce's direction (she is a 31 years old young woman) is tremendously effective. Present time shots alternate with past ones, and the unstoppable chain of events is forged forward, shot after shot. The story's bleakness can be seen in the film's tones (a lot of indoor shots and oudoor location night ones) and the director (successfully) tried not to use over-dramatic grandiloquence. Objective truth is the only thing she is interested in. And this one is terrible enough ! It is interesting to note that we don't see Teena Brandon's character, as a liar and thief she is, as particularly pleasant at the beginning of the film. She becomes likeable little by little, actually more we can feel danger growing and more the other characters show us their true faces.  She is not an heroin, only a sad victim. And now, of course, I must talk about the actress' performance. Hillary Swank, 25 years old when the film was shot, hardly noticed in such stupid films as Buffy, Vampires Killer or Miss Karate Kid (!), worked wonders and deserved the Best Actress Academy Award she won for this role. Her acting perfectly displays Teena/Brandon's enthusiasm for a new life, her naivety in believing that everything will be right, her natural and devastating charm, but also her fragility, her mind's confusion and the uncertainty about her own identity. She becomes very moving in the last thirty minutes, particularly in her relations with Lana. Chloe Sevigny, who is Lana, had unanimous support from critics too and won a Golden Globe. She plays Lana's grunge side with excellence, quite retiring and not very self-confident at the start, physically somewhere between Courtney Love and Madonna. But she slowly changes after her meeting with Brandon, and the love given by the one she believes a boy transforms her into a different girl. And that is all Chloe Sevigny's talent to know how making this low evolution perceptible to us and this character really engaging... The rest of the cast is very good too. Teena Brandon, 21 years old, was murdered on December 30th 1993, as well as her two friends, Lisa Lambert (Candace in the film) and Philip Devine (and not Candace's child). Her two murderers were sentenced, one to Death penalty (by lethal injection), the other one to Life imprisonment... A film not to be missed, in spite of its toughness ! Note 1 The screenplay, refused by US big studios, was eventually shot by an independant director, Kimberly Peirce. Note 2 BOYS DON'T CRY (traditional English saying) has also something to do with English pop group The Cure's song of the same title, song that can be briefly heard in the film.

It is very easy to forget that Swank is indeed a woman during the viewing of this film.  Chloe Sevigny is almost as good.  Her role is very complicated and she shows a great range at a young age.  Everyone else has their moments as well, but Swank and Sevigny definitely stand out among the players.

The movie is just as flawed as I remembered it. There are so many things about it that just don't work.First of all the writing and direction They are just bad. Here is such an interesting subject for a movie and yet they managed to present it in such a boring way. It's slow, during at least half the movie almost nothing happens and we are slowly introduced to very boring and one- dimensional characters and environment.Now, Hilary Swank She is a good actress - I came to like her only from this movie and Million Dollar Baby, which both earned her pretty deserving Oscars. Still, during the entire time I couldn't stop thinking This is Hilary Swank and this is a girl, not a boy. It's usually a very bad sign, when I watch a movie and can't stop thinking about seeing the actual actor and not the character. It's very distracting, too. A movie should be good enough to have the suspension of disbelief make you forget you're watching actors doing their job. I don't know if that's the fault of Hilary Swank (I do think she gave a good performance), or maybe she needed more makeup/prosthetics or maybe it's a problem with the direction. What I'm quite certain is that she DID need to change her voice - it would have helped a lot.Now compare this movie to Predestination (my favorite movie of 2014), with the brilliant performance of Sarah Snook. I'd take Predestination anytime over Boys Don't Cry. Snook's performance, together with the makeup and prosthetics made an amazing character - it was extremely convincing (at least for me), to the point that I needed to go check IMDb the first time I watched the movie (and thus ruin it a little bit for myself) in order to understand what is going on and find out whether the role is played by two actors or just one. If I'd have to choose between Swank's performance and Snook's performance, I'd definitely choose the latter - it's so much more believable and makes you forget you're watching an actress in makeup even when you know that.Peter Sarsgaard is very good in his poorly-written role and almost unrecognizable; Chloe Sevigny is also very good in her poorly-written role.All in all, this is a very missed opportunity, which could have been made into a MUCH better movie in the hands of more capable writer and director.

But I still considered Boys Don't Cry as a movie about a lesbian, a lesbian who doesn't have the courage to face the reality and admit she is a female lesbian, not a man. And I think the belief of she herself is a man but not a woman is the key reason of her tragedy and makes a big contribution to her death in the end.Brandon Teena is the popular new guy in a tiny Nebraska town. He hangs out with the guys, drinking, cussing, and bumper surfing, and he charms the young women, who've never met a more sensitive and considerate young man. But the fact all his friends don't know about is, Brandon actually is a woman who wraps her chest tightly with a piece of cloth to make it look flat and puts another piece of cloth into her pants to make it look like a man's penis.When she is making love to her girlfriend Lana, who does not know she is actually a woman at that time, Lana sees her cleavage and the cloth wrapped around her breast. Though Lana is shocked by the truth she sees, she doesn't expose Brandon's lie. She keeps being Brandon's girlfriend and loving her. She is so nice that she pretends Brandon was a true man and Brandon doesn't know that her girlfriend already finds out her secret.Brandon lies about her sex, but Lana forgives her and ignores it. I can't tell Lana is helping or harming Brandon. Even when Brandon's lie is debunked by other two young men in town, Lana still covers Brandon by saying  I've seen him in the full flesh. I've seen it. I know he is a man. Problem's done? But her saying just makes the two young men even angrier. To prove what the fact is, the two .young men brutally take Brandon's pants off in front of Lana and force her to look at Brandon's private part which is just as normal as an ordinary woman. I think the saddest thing about Brandon is that she considers her woman's body as a defect. Brandon keeps telling everyone that she is born with this weirdness, like a birth defect and she still believes that she is a man when the two angry young men rape and kill her at the end of this movie. At the police station, she doesn't want to admit that she is raped at first. She just says I don't know what he did. When the police officer asks where did they try to pop it in first, it takes so much effort for Brandon to say out the word vagina. And when the police asks her why do you go around kissing girls being you're a girl yourself, she finally admit she has sexual identity crisis instead of emphasizing she is a man.From the beginning to the end, she couldn't accept her sexual identity and lies about it. She doesn't admit that she is a lesbian by reiterating to herself and others time and time again that she is just a transgendered individual. If anyone of Brandon and Lana could stop lying about the fact, maybe Brandon could escape the death. Brandon's tragedy has been destined from the very beginning because of herself.As to me, I have to say I don't like this film at all. The characters in this story are all so abhorrent, including the female lead Brandon. It's based on a true story and the film goes just like how Brandon's life goes on in the real world. It's a destined tragedy and I can feel nothing else but only hopeless after I finished seeing this movie.

Born Teena Brandon and in and out of trouble with the law his whole life, Brandon had a serious problem with his sexual identity, which led to a life on the run from irate and confused people. The girls he seduced described him as the best boyfriend they ever had, and this film, the result of extensive research by director and co-writer Kimberley Pierce, tells his story.Kicked out by his brother, Brandon goes on a drinking binge and ends up going off into the night with the kind-hearted Candace (Alicia Goranson) and her big brother John (Peter Sarsgaard). He ends up staying with them and their friends in the backwater of Falls City. There he falls for a depressed local girl, Lana (ChloÃ« Sevigny), who is similarly enchanted by Brandon's dreams and romantic nature. Their innocent love affair is beautifully drawn against the endless skies and ramshackle houses of the American Mid-West, with Pierce's hypnotic time-lapse photography capturing perfectly the lack of a sense of time passing. Inevitably, though, with the law and Lana's family getting closer to Brandon's true identity, events spiral towards a horrible, harrowing conclusion.Pierce has undoubtedly created something exceptional here. Her camera never turns away from the terrible events it witnesses and this makes the touching central relationship even more affecting.

Hilary Swank and Chloe Sevigny give performances not experienced on film for quite some time.  They are more than believable as fated lovers; they make us cry, we hold them in our hearts and remember them long after the film has ended. Kimberly Peirce has given us much more than a film.

Instead, the makers of this film have gone for something much deeper, more complicated, and more resonant. Characters in this film relate to each other clumsily and inconsistently, just as in real life. And the script treats Brandon neither hagiographically nor exploitively there is no clumsy scene in which someone explains why Brandon does what he does -- it's just taken for granted, as a mystery, and that makes it easier in a way to understand why it might have constituted such a threat to the fragile masculinities of the men who ultimately turned into murderers. (The stunning essay on Matthew Shepard's killers that ran in an issue of Harper's Magazine is a thought-provoking companion piece to this film). Boys Don't Cry also boasts a star-making performance by Hilary Swank, and an excellent supporting cast.Chloe Sevigny's quality has never been put to better effect -- especially when, in a brief sex scene with Brandon, director Kimberly Pierce lets her break out of her ordinariness, and shoots her like a Botticelli -- she suddenly looks ravishing, and it's a fitting visual entry point into the transforming power of that moment in the character's life. In all, a very fine movie indeed, one that feels truthful to the complexities of a strange and disturbing American tragedy.

A brash, cocky, charming young man who's a man's man (he can drink a beer with you, back you up in a barroom fight, bull**it with you by the fire all night long) and a ladies' man, showing a remarkable courtesy, charm and charisma, tough but tender.Of course, anyone who is familiar with the Brandon Teena story knows that he was a she - a young woman who taped down her breasts, stuffed a sock in her pants, wore her hair very short and had a slight swagger in her walk.  She rolled into Falls City, Nebraska and successfully convinced the locals that she was a he.  Brandon falls in love with a local girl, and teaches her to open herself up - like some small town girls, she's bitter, angry and filled with claustrophobic malaise - but Brandon offers her a way out, the dream of going to Memphis. The story made national headlines when Brandon is discovered by the local roughnecks who were once his friends, and is subsequently brutally exposed, raped and, two days later, murdered.From the opening shots, we feel safe in the hands of a confident filmmaker. Kimberly Pierce doesn't push the envelope with any new stylistic devices, telling her story simply and shooting it like a traditional indie film. Yet this serves the story better than you might expect - it never reaches for its moments of joy, tenderness, or intensity, and keeps the film focused entirely on its well written characters.The team in front of and behind the camera is impeccable.  The always reliable Jim Denault continues his impressive career as a cinematographer whose images emote a strange beauty and lyricism.  Randall Poster is the music supervisor (you may remember the name from Velvet Goldmine), and he has become *the* name for music supervision.And what a cast.  Every performance shines, down to the smaller supporting roles.  Every performance, starting from Hilary Swank's startling transformation into Brandon Teena.  After this role, she will without a doubt become the next Lili Taylor of the indie film scene.  Smart, sassy, charming, with an expressive face and a strong screen presence, she blazes across the screen.  It's always something to see the birth of a star, and Swank far surpassed any expectation I had.  Great work.Also very strong is Chloe Sevigny's subtle performance as Lana, Brandon's girlfriend.  The role could easily have been laughable - starting off as sullen, reserved and angry, then showing the light in her eyes when she slowly falls for Brandon's charms to the difficult scenes where she seems to know that Brandon is a girl, but loves her all the same.  Sevigny never seems to be reaching for the right emotional notes - it just seems honest, truthful and always real.  The gentle scenes of lovemaking or just hanging out and talking play with a sweetness uncommon in films, and make this tragedy deeply moving.By the time the horrific events occur in the final third of the film, I cared very deeply for Brandon and Lana, and was shaking and crying as Brandon's friends turn on her.  What makes it so intense is how likable the two guys are who ultimately assault and rape her.  Peter Sasgaard and Brendan Sexton III each invest their characters with a lot of depth and humor.  John and Tom spend a lot of time with Brandon during the early part of the story - she's one of the guys.  They drink beers together, brook philosophical, talk about their lives, back each other up most of the time (except when Sasgaard's John loses his temper in drunken fits, whose extremity and intensity become deeper in retrospect.) These two roles could easily have lapsed into caricature or contrivance - and as much as I enjoyed Sling Blade, the abusive dad in that was still a *movie* character while these guys are the boys next door, raising hell, going in and out of jail for petty crimes.  I grew up with lots of guys just like them, who were pi**ers to hang out with - kinda scary to see how human the face of evil can really be.More scary when you take note of the fact that during a particularly cruel scene toward the end of the film when Brandon is exposed, abused and beaten, one or two insensitive members of the audience were laughing.* * * * for Boys Don't Cry "},{"Title":"A Rough Little Gem","Date":"13 October 1999","Score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Biography, Drama, Romance","Review":"  Meet one of Hilary Swank's newest fans.

So is root canal therapy. Although the film cannot be considered entertainment, it is a compelling document that makes the point that being different can get one into a lot of trouble.Set in Nebraska, the movie takes place in bars, trailer parks and rural locations, which may possess rustic charm in other films, but in this one are just depressing. However, the locale is secondary to the film's universal themes of prejudice and the search for identity.The story is based on real events. Teena Brandon (Hilary Swank), is a woman who prefers to live as a man &#x96; Brandon Teena. He has already commenced the hormone treatments that will help him achieve the change physically. There is little doubt that if he had pursued this gender choice in a large city, he probably wouldn't have attracted undue attention. However, he rejected this course, refusing easy classification. Brandon is referred to as him in nearly all the serious reports of the case. It is as though the media has accorded him the dignity and acceptance that was denied him while he lived. Brandon chose to try and lead the life of a man in a small, semi-rural environment where anonymity was almost impossible. He was attracted to a group of people who were fringe-dwellers with petty crime and anti-social behaviour almost a given. Befriended by John Lotter and Tom Nissen played by Peter Sarsgaard and Brendan Sexton III, he comes to know three women associated with them, an ex-girlfriend named Lana played by ChloÃ« Sevigny, her mother, and another friend Candace, who features in the film's tragic ending. All accept Brandon as a boy, albeit a pretty and slightly built one. Brandon and Lana begin an affair. At first Lana doesn't realise Brandon's true physiology but as time goes on, seems to accept the situation. The affair creates tension among the others, especially John, who is jealous of Lana's attention to Brandon.The discovery by John and Tom that Brandon is still physically a girl leads to ugly events. The final scenes of this film are brutal and haunting. Hilary Swank won the academy award for best actress. It is a searing portrayal that blew away all the other contenders that year. One must feel sorry for those other actors who came up against this tour de force of a performance. Swank lived as a man for a month to prepare for the part. With chest taped and a sock in her jeans, the transformation is startling. The two boys, John and Tom, swagger, brawl and drink in a reckless way that is disturbingly real. Their dysfunctional personalities are painfully revealed. Despite the fact that John and Tom break the law whenever they can get away with it, they are in fact rigid conformists, shaped by an environment that has little tolerance of difference and none at all for gender conflict. The danger they generate is palpable, and it is into this environment that Brandon walks with a degree of innocence. The film is unique in subject matter. It is a disturbing work on every level. Even after another Academy Award, it still marks a career highlight for Hilary Swank, and for Kimberly Peirce, the woman whose creative drive brought it to fruition. Between them, they have created a work that is more of an experience than a film.

'Boys Don't Cry' is an incredible film. Biopics on people who became a topic and remained as such, are easier to make. For example, a Alexander or a Ray don't need an introduction.

Controversy caught the film, many claiming it as a half-hearted attempt.As a film, 'Boys Don't Cry', as mentioned, is an incredible film. Kimberly Peirce & Andy Bienen write a biopic, on a short-lived Trans Man with high volume. People say 'You Know, The Final 30-Minutes are Very Depressing'. I damn-en those comments, because...

Lana being the only one to stand by Brandon is helpless while matters change from bad to worse.To quote another fellow reviewer, 'Boys Don't Cry' is about discovering one's own identity. While we are introduced to numerous characters who are lost, Brandon is the one who discovers herself and so does Lana (at a later stage in the movie). While we initially see the rest of the group accepting Brandon as one of their own, it doesn't take long for them to react when Brandon turns out to be what they resent (based on their own prejudice). The surprise discovery of her identity threatens and confuses their view of their own identity.The plot initially moves at a lethargic pace before picking up on the way. Cinematography is OK and lighting is terrible. The setting though fits the movie tends to be a bit dull at times. However, it could be argued that director Peirce wanted the audience to focus more on the story and characters. She has created the feel of the atmosphere of 'lower class' people. There are several very disturbing and graphic scenes that many might not be able to sit through.Hilary Swank delivers an astounding performance. She seems to have played one of the most challenging and difficult roles (that I've witnessed on screen) with ease. She delicately underplays her part.

Two young men murdered him in the small town of Humboldt, Nebraska, unable to cope with the existence of someone outside of the norms they were carefully taught. The world took little notice of Brandon's passing back then. But when the relatively inexpensive production of Boy's Don't Cry got rave reviews resulting in an first Oscar for Hilary Swank, his story became known the world over.It's only been in the past decade that the transgender right movement spun out on its own from the general gay/lesbian civil rights cause. Stories like Brandon Teena's or Gwen Araujo's or one of Moses Preston Waller, a case that I was familiar with back in my working days at the New York State Crime Victims Board have brought the ugliest manifestation of discrimination that transgendered people face, that of loss of life. A terrible price to raise the consciousness of the general public. Teena Brandon was born in Lincoln, Nebraska a biological woman and moved to Humboldt later on where she reversed her name and presented himself to the public as Brandon Teena. It's what Brandon saw inside himself, what he felt to the depths of his soul. As a man he won and wooed a woman played in the film by Chloe Sevigny, but some of the redneck crowd Brandon hung out with suspected something afoot. Including some of Chloe Sevigny's relatives.The brutal rape and killing of Brandon Teena is probably only comparable to the honor killings that are sanctioned by some extreme branches of Islam. It was as if their own honor, their own sense of masculine self was compromised by him even touching a woman. They reaffirmed their flagging masculinity with rape and purged the family of dishonor with a homicide. And they felt totally justified in doing it which is the real scary part.When I was a kid of eleven I remember when it was a foregone conclusion that Susan Hayward would be an Oscar winner for I'll Cry Tomorrow. Years later it was also concluded for Jack Palance for Supporting Actor in City Slickers. The only other time odds weren't even given in an Oscar race for Hilary Swank in Boys Don't Cry. In the memory of most of the movie-going public this was something that just didn't happen. But Hilary Swank pulled something from the depths of her own soul, that's something seen a few times in a life when she played Brandon Teena. For me, Boy's Don't Cry was a cathartic experience that I had never had before watching a film. It was brilliant, but terribly painful. I said at the time I probably would never see the film again, but I did in order to write this commentary. It was just as cathartic as before and even more so after the annual Transgender Day of Remembrance which I participated in my town of Buffalo, New York.Hilary Swank, Chloe Sevigny and the rest of the cast and crew have made an enduring classic. This review is dedicated with reverence to the life of Moses Preston Waller who questioned the package God put his soul in and like Brandon Teena paid for those questions with his life at too young an age.

The duo are a love story for the millennium, a mismatched couple that find perfection in imperfection.

And Chloe Sevigny (who I have been a fan of ever since I was her in 1995's Kids), who was especially fine, as deserves as much praise as Hilary, Chloe (I feel) also deserved the Oscar for Best Supporting Actress. She was just perfect and probably the only one capable of playing a frustrated teenager with a dead-end job in a tiny town. A teenager who has never been treated with sensitivity and respect. Who has never experienced real intimacy. Her performance burnt into my memory and will stay there.

DirectorPeirce remade this film, since it was originally a short film with a different cast members. Swank win her first Academy Award for her unforgettable in her positively stunning and mesmerizing lead performance. Sevigny is also very good as Brandon's love life (Who deliberately doesn't ask too many questions and a free-spirited). Sevigny was nominated for the Oscar as Best Supporting Actress. Sarsgaard is also good as the homophobic rapist. Some people will have a hard time watching the film's violent conclusion. But in any respect, this is a must see. One of the most important films of 1999. Same material is also seen in the documentaryThe Brandon Tenna Story. Written by the director and Andy Biener. (**** Â½/*****).

Watching the final scene I had a big lump in my throat and feeling so sad. That almost never happens when I watch movies. I won't explain the plot, a lot of people have already done that and it is not the most important thing in this film. It is a film about feeling, about being yourself, making mistakes and paying for them, against prejudice. Few movies actually feel so real as this one - the setting, the characters, the action. Hilary Swank was performed superbly in this movie, I just don't understand why does she gets so few good roles nowadays. You could see Brandon's desire to live the way he/she wants, the struggle he made in life. She was so believable pretending to be a boy. I really felt compassion for her.  And the love story with Lana(another powerful performance from ChloÃ« Sevigny) was so beautiful, well done and moving... Another great feature is the portrayal of the characters - they all had some flaws,there aren't the perfectly innocent victims Hollywood loves to use,  even  Tom and John( the bad guys) showed some good sides of their personalities( although at the end of the movie I really wanted them to suffer terribly). Especially the actor who plays John did a really good job. His character was both scary and realistic. The music also played its part in  creating the great emotions this movie brings to us.

Brandon Teena is played excellently by Hilary Swank in a dynamite, Oscar-winning performance. The film chronicles Brandon's fun-loving, carefree, and self-destructive adventures through rural Nebraska as he tries to find the right girl. One day, he meets some new friends who whisk him off to the small, uncharted town of Falls City, Nebraska, where Brandon meets the lovely Lana (Chloe Sevigny) who was Oscar-nominated for her brilliant performance. Once Brandon is settled in, and has wooed Lana, the films becomes the most charming fairy tale come true love story. Things inevitably take a plunging turn for our young hero when problems with his gender rises. This film goes from sweet, to shocking, to an ultimately horrifyng climax. Based on true events, this film graphically depicts the events that brought the struggle of one boy's quest for love into a voyage of Hell. Peter Sarsgaard also gives a great performance as one of the friends.Director and co-writer Kimberly Peirce has made a masterpiece with her intimate portrait of American white trash and a truly moving story and blends into a riveting, intense, and thought-provoking movie experience. I strongly recommend this film to all who seek not just good entertainment, but a wonderful chance to see beautiful performances and a sad, but altogether beautiful film that has the courage to go where no film has gone before. This is a truly original love story that has some of the same sacrificial elements of Rome & Juliet. This film is NOT recommended for the close-minded, homophobic, or weak-hearted. This film is strong, but graceful. Sad, but brilliant. Hilary Swank's acting alone make this film worth watching. As an actress, Swank truly made wonders for herself is the breakthrough role that has to be seen to be believed. Kimberly Peirce was robbed of an Oscar nod for Best Director, she truly has a grip on the issue. I saw this in theaters and I was crying heavily by the film's unforgettable end.

This movie did not shy away from Brandon Teena's past criminal history as Teena Brandon.When one watches this movie,one is drawn into an almost hypnotic state into where Brandon's girlfriend Lana Tisdel (superbly played by Chloe Sevigny,nominated for the Best Supporting Actress Oscar) is a woman who does not ask many questions and truly accepts who Brandon is,even after she finds out that she is a woman in a sexual identity crisis preferring her identity as a man.Peter Saarsgard and Brendon Sexton III are absolutely chilling as the killers of Brandon and 2 other people.The murder sequence that followed Brandon's rape and subsequent police report is probably one of the most chilling ending murder sequences in a movie since the ending of Looking For Mr. Goodbar.Also turning up in this movie is one of those actresses where one wonders,Didn't I see her before for a long time on television?-Alicia Goranson(formerly of the TV show, Roseanne.).Overall,this is a superb movie about a very courageous woman who had the courage to pass as a man and sadly, paid the ultimate price once her deception was found out.One also feels for Lisa and Phillip,the 2 others murdered with Brandon.The love sequences between Hilary Swank and Chloe Sevigny were also handled very well.As nice to the women as Brandon was,it is little wonder that Lana loved him so much.I give this movie a rating of 10 out of 10.It is one of 1999's best movies in a year that had a number of very well done movies.

The inevitable violence that takes place in the movie is truly horrifying given the depth of the characters that have been created. The writing and acting and direction come together to present a true story that is as engrossing as it is terrible - we feel like we are looking through a window into real people's lives, each one victimized by the nightmare in which they inhabit.As the lead character, Brandon Teena is a deeply flawed person, a woman who lies to herself and others with such desperate conviction that I began to believe her as well.  I don't know if anyone but Hilary Swank could have pulled this off, but she does a perfect job.  ChloÃ« Sevigny is wonderful as Lana, a woman who ultimately sees through the lies, but continues to embrace them and Brandon as her only chance of escape.Kimberly Peirce's direction is very good, only calling attention to itself in the stop-motion sequences that well-illustrate the suffocating monotany of the small town.  Time is flying by, and the rest of the world, too, but nothing is going to change in Falls City, Nebraska.  It is a place so in-bred and isolated that the inhabitants are forced to victimize themselves and each other in their struggle to keep things the same.  It is a place that still exists and needs to be witnessed and understood.  This movie makes sure that the tragic loss of those whose lives are destroyed by such place will not be forgotten.

Hillary Swank (who I've never seen before) is heart-stoppingly good as poor, sexually confused, Brandon Teena/Teena Brandon. To see what happens to her is as agonizing as it is inevitable. The story is based on real events in late 1993 in and around the small town (pop. 5000) of Falls City, Nebraska, and the casual attitude of the authorities to Teena's assailants is staggering (just drop by the station in the morning, guys). Instead of course they go out and kill a few people. Apparently the filming was done near Dallas as memories around Falls City were still a little raw. I hope the good citizens of that town feel just a tiny bit of shame. At least the sheriff didn't get re-elected next time up.The film does present the killers, John and Tom, in a mildly sympathetic way &#150; white trash losers already with jail records unable to cope with discovering that their new mate Brandon, who has taken up with John's ex-girlfriend Lana, is actually a girl. It has to be said that they are not nice guys, being cruel, violent and unstable. I was relieved to discover that both got convicted of murder-it wouldn't have been surprising if they had got off before a Falls City jury. Perhaps their mistake was to have killed a couple of `normal' people as well as Brandon. After all, Brandon was just an `it'.Hillary Swank as Brandon and Chloe Sevigny as Lana, the boy-girl and the girl-woman, are excellent together. Brandon is not over-bright but he shares his trashy dream (flight to Memphis) with Lana, and she responds to a sensitivity she has not met in a man before. In the end when she realises Brandon is not a man she doesn't care.The only thing that bothered me about the film was that it's easy to portray in a harsh light white trash living in the boondocks. Perhaps the story would have even more impact if the events had occurred amongst `nicer' people. As it is, the viewer is inclined to say `Well, it's all horrible, but what to you expect from a bunch of ignorant white trash?' I'm not even sure `ignorant white trash' would necessarily behave like that. I think John and Tom were just stupid violent people who behaved accordingly.Anyway, a triumph for Hillary and director/co-screenwriter Kimberly Peirce, but not an easy movie to watch.

Not only does she make a credible transition to a male but she shows the humanity of the character with great bravura. Chloe Sevigny, playing Brandon's love, Lana, is also excellent. She is a top notch actress whose eyes alone say a thousand words. The rest of the cast is also terrific. Director Kimberly Peirce creates an atmosphere so vivid and acute that one feels as if they are right there in the middle of the situation which is  brilliant in creating such powerful discomfort.

I would give it * * * (out of four). The acting is excellent.  I never heard of most of the cast before I saw it.  Hillary Swank got most of the publicity, and rightly so I guess, since she was the lead character and was nominated for the lead actress Oscar. (I saw it the night before the awards.)  However, I was real impressed with Chloe Sevigny and I didn't even know until I got home that she also was nominated as best supporting actress.Since I wasn't familiar with with the cast for the most part, and they were all great actors/actresses, that made their portrayals as the Northern (Nebraska) white trash characters extremely realistic.  However, to me that was both a plus and a minus.  They were so real and relentless in their white trash behavior that they all got on my nerves, like I was there with them instead of watching them in a movie.  It's sorta nauseating to realize that there are people just like that all around us.  That brings up another problem I had with the movie - about half of the characters had southern accents though it is set in Nebraska.  I noticed that it was filmed in Texas, so maybe they recruited some locals for roles in the movie, but it seems like it would perpetuate northerners' continuing perception that we're all white trash down here in the south, or that white trash people only exist in the south.The movie is very depressing at times, and I had a hard time forming an objective opinion without considering the depressing theme and the redneck factor.

The entire cast were excellent in there roles and obviously well chosen. I went to this film with no knowledge of the true story that lay behind it and perhaps this affected my grasp of the film. What I mean by that is, it seemed that the director expected the audience to have some knowledge of Brandon Teena's story. This may be the reason why there was not enough understanding of character motivation on the audiences behalf. And the director also tended to fall into the trap of the retelling of events rather than character development. An excellent director can tell us everything about a character with one shot. This lack of development lead me to find the beginning of this movie very disjointed. All this aside the amazingly convincing performances from the entire cast held this film up to be a fascinating watch. The direction of the rape and love making scenes were brillantly executed and did make up for other direction flaws in the movie.

Hilary really deserved to win the Oscar for her brilliant performance.Whereas American Beauty is in my opinion too pretentious and overdone, BDC is much truer to the point in portraying and criticising the dark(er) side of American society. The depiction of Trailer Park life, working class and youth in this environment is remarkably realistic it helps a lot to understand Lana's 'belief' in Brendan being a guy and, on the other hand, in Tom and John's tragic reaction when they finally find out that he is actually a she.

Of course she is talking about Brendan/Teena, the misguided, and certainly misunderstood, centerpiece of this film.This is the true story of a girl who truly believes that she should have been born a man.  As the film opens Teena (played by Hilary Swank) is making herself up to be the boy (Brendan) she always thought she should be.  She leaves one redneck town to find anonymity in another.  In a bar she meets Candace, (played by Alicia Goranson, Becky on TV's Roseanne).  They become fast friends and Brendan is quickly allowed into Candace's circle.The wonderful world of white trash is highlighted as we see a cast of characters who have already thrown away any chance of getting out of their circumstances, and who lack the moral integrity to see the foolishness of their lives.Peter Sarsgaard plays John, a maniacal dim wit who rules by fear and is ruled by his own short temper.  Lana (played by Cloe Sevigny)turns heads in her small town, and Brendan becomes quite smitten with her, but even she is a victim of her surroundings, continually getting drunk to the point of no return.For us big city folk who only venture into small towns at Christmas and Mother's Day, Boys Don't Cry only serves to make our blood boil.  Small town values enveloped in small minded views are the order of the day, as the people here seem to think that life revolves around them and god forbid that they be open to someone else's way of living.Hilary Swank seems destined for Oscar night in a performance that is beyond believable.  We feel sorry for this character because she is flawed and she does not see the problems in her life, but we don't, for one minute, doubt her own intelligence and right to live her life as she chooses.I am not too familiar with the actual events that surround this story, so it would be hard to comment on the accuracy of the characters depicted here. For the most part they are cardboard cut outs of what we think white trash ought to be.  The women are child bearing nymphs and the men are just pure evil.  Whatever the case, perhaps this is just the swift kick in the pants some of them folks out there need to see what monsters they can truly be.On the other hand, I doubt this will ever play at the movie-plex in Anytown, USA.

I think that's incredibly short-sighted.  This movie is about someone who was struggling with questions about their own identity, and society's attitude towards it.  We may not be exactly like Brandon Teena/Teena Brandon, but who among us hasn't, at some point in our lives, struggled with some kind of identity question, at who we are and how we fit in, especially in today's world, when we're bombarded with how we're supposed to fit a perfect mold, and are left aside when we don't?So in addition to Brandon's story, we get the parallel story of Lana, played beautifully by Chloe Sevigny, who is fast emerging as one of our best young actresses.  Like Brandon, Lana struggles with questions of identity.  She works in a factory on the night shift, and lives in a small town where there's nothing to do(except the odd karaoke night) and no one new to be with.  She's headed for the stereotypical role we apply to woman at her stage in life, and while she knows she doesn't want that, she sees no way of escaping.  Then she meets Brandon, and for the first time, sees a hope of escaping.  For her, the talk of Memphis and singing for a living is more than just a dream, it's a way to open up new worlds for her.  This, perhaps, is why she denies to herself who Brandon really is.That feeling, initially, is also why Lana's friends, including John and Tom also deny to themselves who Brandon really is.  He brings something fresh and different to their world, just by being so gung-ho to join (even after Brandon screws up so many times early on when trying to ride on the back of a truck, we can see John cheered by his perseverance).  And as one reviewer up here pointed out, if Brandon did deceive everybody, it was a willing deception; they so wanted something new they wore blinders until things came to a head.  And yet while this was a horrible crime, director Kimberly Peirce manages to convince us that these weren't terrible people; they just did a terrible thing.Of course, I have to mention Hilary Swank in the main role, especially since I was going to pass this up because of her initially.  I had seen her in a couple of movies(BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER) and wasn't impressed, plus she was on Beverly Hills 90210.  But she's amazing here.

He wasn't a crusader and martyr (though we can make him), just someone who wanted to live truthfully to his nature. Even in the gay community, transgenders get a lot of c**p.What struck me was when Brandon was in jail, convincing Lana desperately that he had a sexual disorder. He didn't want to go back living the way he was as a woman, but rather be abnormal and crazy in the eyes of others so long as he can be accepted as a man- living as he wanted to be. Being young and naive, that logic didn't work, but it shows Brandon's raw, joyous impulse to live honestly to his nature, and could never go back to the closet and be dishonest to himself. Therefore I don't see that scene as suggestion that transgenderism is pathological. And the scenes with the nurse who examined him, and the mother's disgust with John and Tom's assault struck me too, that not all people are a******s, when they are willing to connect on a human level they can begin to change. The scenes added to character development which made them more real and powerful. This film inspired me greatly more than frightened me.Hilary Swank is spectacular and made me a believer. Before this film I perceived her as another actress but glad that I'm wrong. She's not just an actress but an artist, and her ability to carry out all the ranges of emotional nuances and physical expressions made her character realer than real. At times during the film I certainly forgot that she's a woman.

There's a rape sequence that's almost impossible to sit through, and some people walked out of the theatre I saw it in towards the end when it was clear she was going to be killed. I almost joined them! Still, I recommend it and find it great to see a movie that doesn't hold back. Just brace yourself for some truly horrific violence.

I had seen The Brandon Teena Story before, and found that work to be profoundly moving and even life-changing.  But seeing the details brought so vividly and unflinchingly to life was deeply traumatic--and I am not usually disturbed by graphic movies.  I'm interested to hear what other progressive queers thought of the film; I myself identified strongly both with Brandon and with Lana, the woman who loved him in spite of the social consequences.  I walked out of the theater feeling utterly disgusted with the human race that is capable of such profound evil, and also feeling convinced of my own vulnerability, convinced that there is no reason why Brandon Teena's life was not my own, other than the sheer dumb luck of being from an urban, somewhat more accepting part of the world. I was a little disappointed that the movie strayed from the facts of Brandon's murder; I was unsure why the script decided to have Lana present for the shootings, other than to have her screaming dramatically in the background.  I think, also, that the director might have chosen to put a blurb at the end of the movie about the growing transgender movement. Brandon was transgendered, and every day the movement led by people like Leslie Feinberg and Kate Bornstein grows stronger.  Brandon described himself as having a sexual identity disorder; this hints at pathology, and it seems reviewers are picking up on the term as  if it were the correct classification.  The director might have used her last minute with the audience to educate about transgenderism, instead of merely thanking Kate Bornstein and transmen in the credits.  At the very least, a nod to Matthew Shepard or James Byrd would have been nice, to prod the audience into the conscious realization that hate crimes are alive and well, and are interconnected.

And it does pander to that curiosity. But it gets beyond that to quite vividly show that relationships are about sharing, caring and intimacy, regardless of physical how-to's, making sexual identity confusion more sympathetic than the usual treatment of transsexuals in film, including The Adventures of Priscilla, or maybe it's just because the gender is different. Or maybe it's Hilary Swank's amazing performance.There is a frightening sense of isolation surrounding these trailer-park trash characters--not just the very confused central character, Teena Brandon/Brandon Teena, but all these screwed-up, very drunken, very bored folks in very small Texas towns, such that one very much fears for their progeny. I thought it looked like alcoholism is a bigger problem than homophobia and threats to sexual identity such that you are made sympathetic to the desperate lives of all of them where they seem to only have sex and violence as outlets. Reminded me of a line in the Hal Ketchum song to the effect that the world must be flat because everyone who leaves never comes back.Brendon Sexton III is once again playing a threatening character, like in Welcome to the Dollhouse, but he was unrecognizable at first in curls and scraggly beard as the follower not the initiator.

At first everything seems to go perfectly, but than his new friends find out his true identity, thanks to a letter from the police. Brandon has committed grand theft auto, but that's not their main concern. Their biggest problem is the fact that she has lied to them and that Brendon isn't a guy, but a girl pretending to be one. They can't cope with that and decide to learn him/her a lesson. What follows is humiliation, rape and eventually even murder...Of course this kind of movies is very popular when the Oscars are being handed out, and this time it wasn't any different. It won two Oscars, one was for Hilary Swank's performance. I can only agree with that. Not only has she been courageous enough to play a role like that (I'm sure that many conservative Americans will have a lot of difficulties with this role), she also played it very convincingly. The other actors did a good job as well of course, but her performance stood out in my opinion. All in all this is a very interesting movie that is more than just worth a watch, thanks to the good acting and the subject. I give it a 7.5/10.

Fags are never stared at as a sort of abnormality. When we look back, I found they lived very hard and unfair that time. Everyone has a dream. Teena tried her best to doing that, her ending never means her failure, she knew who she is and detected her value in her life from the romance. She's fortunate because not everybody knew that, even if they had lived for seventy or eighty years or more. Teena got it when she's only twenty-one. Sexual identity crisis or queer phenomenon is still a sensitive topic somewhere such as my hometown. Maybe our culture is truly conservative. But I learned everyone's every type of love should be respectable if only it's true. I esteem every choice that from heart and I love the character of Hilary Swank.

The story ofBrandon Teena, nee Teena Brandon, a Nebraska woman who set out to fulfillher dream of living as a man, must have been nearly impossible to tell. After her identity was found out by her friends shortly after her twenty-first birthday, they raped and killed her, as well as the friends she was staying with. This savage hate crime was smeared all over the tabloids and looked as if it were doomed to become a diluted TV-movie of the week. Thank God for director/co-writer Kimberly Peirce. She miraculously strips away all the sensationalism to bring Falls City, NE and its residents to life so vividly that its nearly surreal. This is not a movie with witty one-liners and a chunky screenplay filled with big ideas, but this is one of those rare films that celebrates the human spirit with none of the sentimentality of swill like Life Is Beautiful or A Beautiful Mind. Even better, Peirce transcends matters ofgender identity and captures the essence of Brandon's soul (incarnated byHilary Swank in an Oscar-winning tour de force), yearning to be its true self. What is beautiful about the relationship that Brandon found with Lana Tisdel(the equally mesmerizing Chloe Sevigny) is that Lana is far more intelligent and spiritually evolved than her family and friends. She recognizes that Teena is both male and female; not a man trapped in a woman's body, but a personwho has risen above the limitations she was born with. Although the last half- hour of the film, which unflinchingly depicts Brandon's rape and murder is nearly unwatchable, Peirce and co-writer Andy Bienen still manage to end on ahopeful note. They depict with stunning clarity the meeting and lovemaking of not just bodies, but hearts and minds. Teena Brandon was too beautiful a spirit to survive amidst the cruelty in America's heartland, but in Lana Tisdel shefound someone she could soar with, however briefly. Brandon Teena had thecourage to be himself, and Lana Tisdel has the courage to be herself. God bless them both, and God bless the cast and crew of Boys Don't Cry.

Here she falls in love with Lana and the two start a relationship together.  However as the authorities ask more questions of him and his friends start to work things out, Brandon risks exposure and hurt.At the time Swank won her Oscar for this I must admit to not having really heard of it.  Couple of years later it came onto TV and the Oscar was enough reason for me to watch.  I didn't even know that this was a true story until after I had watched it, so the impact it had on me was perhaps a little delayed, but it did have an impact.  The plot follows the struggles of Brandon not only to fit in with a world that he has to lie to but also the struggle he has within his own mind over who he is.  The film builds well with small running battles in both sense before climaxing in a reaction that is depressing but sadly would be true in many cases.In terms of entertainment value I must admit that this is a little low but it just highlights the complexity of the situation.  If I were in one of the character's shoes I'm sure I'd be as shocked as they were - however the film allows me to see it from Brandon's point of view and understand a little of how difficult it must be.  The material is too depressing because it does come down to human nature but it is a story worth seeing.Swank is excellent in the lead and deserves her Oscar.  She is totally convincing throughout and some of the scenes must have been very, very difficult to shoot.  Sevigny is as good as she nearly always is - she has done some challenging films but always carries them off.  The support cast are good and must have been difficult to express the strong emotions required here - Sarsgaard and Sexton in particular.  Director Peirce delivers the story straight without focusing too much on wider issues and it helps the film as the story of this woman and a strong performance by Swank are all that is needed.Overall this is not a fun film to watch but it is involving, moving and ultimately depressing.  Knowing it is true makes it that much harder to be untouched by the film - it challenges opinions I sure that many of us hold deep down in our hearts even if we've never thought about them.

When he realizes that he has the power to cry. Only then is he comfortable enough with himself that he can be one with his emotions and allow them to develop on a whole new level. Teena Brandon was a real person, Teena Brandon was a real individual and Teena Brandon was a real girl. This is her story. But what makes this film so great is that it is not about who did what or what came from who, rather it is a haunting story of a girl who was facing a sexual identity crisis and a boy who just wanted to belong.  That girl was Teena Brandon. She lived in a Nebraska trailer park with a friend who was forced to run to a small town by the name if Falls City. She has to leave because of the before mentioned `boy.' His name was Brandon Teena. He was an exact replica of Teena except with short cut hair and a stock stuffed down the front of his jeans. If you haven't figured it out yet, Teena was a transsexual. But it wasn't that Teena wanted to be male, more over, Teena believed that she could be male. In Falls City she is instantly befriended by a group of friends who welcome her into their string of drugs and alcohol. They are not like this because they feel that it is the cool thing to do, they are like this because they know no other way. This is where Brandon's eyes catch a glace of Lana. Lana is a dark and depressed girl who is always in a haze of reality and never knows exactly who she is. She may look rough on the exterior but she is not a bad person. She is a ray of light that the sun has never set upon. She knows no happiness therefore she feels none and has no sympathy for herself or her situation. Then one day Brandon brings her a flower. He is by no means a perfect human specimen, yet he is a caring and compassionate individual whose intentions include no harm. The two fall in love and plane big things together based on the big dreams Brandon has told her about. But just like Brandon's life, most of them are base don lies. Not lies that were indented to hurt, but lies that were indented to disguise morality. They go through many stages of their love, one being denial after the entire town finds out of Brandon's true form. This is what makes a film like this work. It loves it characters and would prefer more to base its surroundings on human nature instead of emotions. There is a scene in which Brandon and Lana are beginning to engage in their love when Lana sees down Brandon's shirt. She is confused by her sightings but drawn by her passion. We suspect that she must know by now that Brandon was a girl but the question is at what point does she become in tune with it that it matters less what she loves more than who she loves. There are numerous ways that this film could have gone in a totally wrong direction. But the film does everything right. It doesn't mar us with true-life facts or define anyone into typical labels. There is no right or wrong answer to the question that this film represents so director Kimberly Peirce has no intentions on ever answering it. This is not a film out to exploit the lives of teens; it is a study on how teens exploit each other. It is not a tale of boy meets girl. It is a tale of mind meets body and it is not a look into social injustices. It is a look into human injustices. Peirce obviously knew her material before going into this film. Even though these are real life characters deep down inside I can't help but feel that there is a little Brandon Teena in all of us. Everyone has that one desire that they long for but can't achieve it because they don't believe in it. Brandon is not a gifted with a huge amount of intelligence. He doesn't seem to be able to decipher between a good choice and a band one, but he is smart enough to know that when he has a choice there is no taking the easy way out. Some of those choices led him to happiness, some led him to despair, some even led him to the brink of his own decency, but one led him straight to tragedy. This is a very disturbing film, hard to watch at times, but it is not disturbing because of its often graphic content of subject matter. It is disturbing because of the wide array of emotions it has tucked firmly in its grasp. Emotions can be terrifying things if you don't know how to use them, but ever more disturbing are they if you know how to use them just to well. Brandon is not a likeable character or one that anyone should feel sorry for. He brought everything that happened to him on himself, right? But because we are able to see a small piece of us in his big universe that we come to feel for him, love him even. This isn't a film about a bunch of stupid teens going through hard times. This is about a bunch of stupid teens going through our times. We just don't see out lives like that of these characters because we know otherwise. We know that we can come home at night and eat a nice meal and spend time with a loving family. What we don't know is that we are living an image that has been taught to us. Weird isn't it? We live an ideal life that we gather from the media, now when the media is showing us what our life is really like it is a little hard to stomach because it is not what we have come to terms with Emotions, scary things aren't they? This is why Peirce can base a film something that is looked down upon in society and make it into something that has to speak about love, compassion and a desire to be one with yourself and have other be able to understand that self that is you. Hilary Swank won her first Oscar for her role as Brandon, and it was a well-disserved victory. Swank declines any invitation to over act her character and also refuses to under exaggerate her. She is not an actor yet she is not an amateur, she is a human being in a film about a human being and because of that we know what she is going through even though we may not fully understand her situation. Chloe Sevigny is also not far behind Swank as Lana, matching the star scene for scene. Sevigny creates an invisible wall around here character that reads like a keep out sign but only draws you closer to wanted to understand how this character functions. This is a film that wants you to ask questions about its characters but not get answers from their actions; this is not a film of stereotyping. All of the actors understand that and work towards it. It is a factor that makes for three for the most intense and beautiful love scenes since Blue Velvet and one of the most brutal rape sequences since Heaven and Earth. These are actors in possession of roles that require a lot of mental strain from them and they are all content on giving it. If you don't know how the story ends I would be glad to inform you. Like any slice of true love, it must end in tragedy. After being raped, Brandon is mercilessly shot and killed due to a lack of participation from the local police. You may want to ask yourself, how could such a sweet and caring individual who wanted nothing more than to be who he wanted to be killed with such little sympathy? Because, boys don't cry.

This film achieves that, obviously.  It has deeply moved anyone with even half a heart. Unfortunately, the subject matter of this film is SO unfamiliar to most people, that many have no understanding of what it was about. That's not their fault, nor Ms. Peirce's since had she spelled it all out to us, what we would have seen was a competent TV-type movie of the week, instead of a powerhouse of a film that touches us to the depths of our souls. But I think after reading so many of the reviews here at IMDB, some important facts should be understood.Brandon was not a male impersonator or a lesbian, or crazy.  He was a pre-operative female-to-male transsexual.  That is, he was a male before the necessary physical transition that a transsexual goes through (ie. hormones and surgery) before he can be officially be declared a man.  He was not a liar.  He was a walking contradiction.  He was as much a man as he would have been had he had the chance to undergo the biological and surgical transition.  Because his body had not caught up with his mind, it's understandable that many people are confused about this.  But hopefully, this fact will help audiences understand the confusion that Brandon felt. He was raised to believe, like all of us are, that what decides a person's gender is their anatomy, so the fact that his body was a lie to him all his life made it nearly impossible to live with the contradiction of what he organically knew to be the truth in his mind.  Once he finally expressed his true self to the world by donning the physical appearance of 'Brandon', he could no longer go back to being 'Teena'.  The cat was out of the bag. Imagine yourself as a man who knows that in order to not live a lie he must be called Teena and dress as a female every day of his life in order to join the workforce or socialize with other people.  Once he'd fully established himself as the man he was, he could not subject himself to 'female drag', for what would have been numerous years for him (sex reassignment surgery costs tens of thousands of dollars and takes one to three years, once the process is started).A reviewer here wrote why Brandon chose to live there (Nebraska) with her lifestyle is beyond me.  I'd like to kindly explain to this viewer and others who share the same sentiment that the answer to that puzzler is that Brandon was not a her and his reality was not a lifestyle.  Many people 'disagree' with this very fact.  Thus, it is understandable that had Brandon gone to San Francisco, Paris, or Timbuktu, he would have confronted the same confusion and frustration, and unfortunately hostility and violence, no matter where he went.  There are simply millions of people who do not understand transsexualism, thus it is common that their confusion leads to simply believing that it is the transsexual who is confused.  I am not blaming anyone for these sentiments.  It's only in recent years (mostly thanks to the internet) that there has been detailed study of female-to-male transsexualism.  There are millions of female-to-male transsexuals throughout the world, and sadly most of them have suffered much of the pain that Brandon suffered until they became aware that they were not alone. Had the internet been available to Brandon during his lifetime, he would have had an opportunity to see that he was not alone, and that there were others like him who could lend him their support and guidance.I'm most grateful to Ms. Peirce for making such a brave and deeply touching film, and I hope that viewers will, whether they understand Brandon or not, find an even deeper layer of tolerance for people who are quite different from themselves.

This contemporary tragedy, with the outsider- hero who has to break the rules (the common formula boy-meets-girl is substituted for girl-meets-girl), is a consequence of the usual intolerance against the difference. Ignorance always leads to fear, prejudices should be fought with understanding. Although BDC develops a great narrative (introduction of the character-transgression-tragedy), its form isn't much far away from tv movies. But in my opinion the best in this movie are the performances Hillary Swank is a convincing heartbreaker lad (she definitely deserved that oscar), and, of course, ChloÃ« Sevigny. She was absolutely adorable as a naive lovesick (almost sublime). I truly recommend this movie for all supporters of indie cinema.

She convinced me that Brandon Teena is really a man. I don't think any other human being could've done a better job. The same goes to director Kim Peirce. This is my favorite movie of all time! Before I saw this movie, I never thought that the art of film making could reach such perfection! This story is not only true but it is very delicate, a single second of bad acting would've ruinned the entire project! And we never saw that single second of bad acting from any of the cast members! The movie doesn't focus on hate crimes or being a gender case study, instead it portrays Brandon as a lone drifter on a doomed quest for happiness. He moves to a different town to start a new life and then moves to the next after his secret is discovered; and so the cycle continues. The setting is a trailor trash town where everybody is almost the same. No one seems to have a future or even any enthusiasm for life. Brandon stood out from everyone by being nice to girls and by being optimistic. His most obvious feature is that he's not very smart so he's always taking the wrong risks. He has thousands of dollars worth of speeding tickets, is wanted for 18 counts of grand theft auto and has a bunch of fake IDs; he tells his new found friends in Fall City that his mom's an actress and that his sister is a supermodel (we know he's lying). We notice that he never thinks far enough ahead so he's always getting into trouble. We also realize that when we as human beings are troubled, lonely, and in search of sanity; we are willing to take such risks. His whole life is one wreck after another. Despite his police record and web of lies, he's a really nice person who's always running away from his past. Which is full of suicidal memories and mistakes he needs to be forgiven for. I think  the point of the story is that happiness is just an illusion. Think about that scene when he gets physically intimate with his girlfriend. And then the next day she's thinking about him, and she kinda knows that he might be a girl. Instead of trying to find out the truth, she pushes the thoughts into the back of her mind and refuses to think about it. Why? Cuz if he is a girl then the romance is over and the nicest young man she's ever known will cease to exist. And as for Brandon, as long as he keeps up his charade of lies, he's okay; but at some point the past will catch up with him. And then we realize that there are those who have to pay a large price for only a brief moment of happiness.

Boys Don't Cry is a slow-motion train wreck of a movie that is watched with a deer-in-the-headlights sort of morbid fixation.  It's a work of art not meant to be enjoyed, but rather to be felt viscerally.  It's quite a good movie... but definitely not for the faint of heart.Director Kimberly Peirce deftly exposes the dark underbelly of small-town life, while simultaneously finding the humanity in even the most evil characters.  The villains here aren't faceless monsters, nor is the victim an innocent angel-- we see them all, for good or ill, as real people. Much of the production has an amateurish quality to it, however, with silly visual effects and melodramatic close-ups that detract from the mood. Peirce would have been wise to keep the sensationalism to a minimum and focus more on character development.  In the end, Boys Don't Cry is saved from mediocrity by the compelling tragedy of the story, and the strong performances of Hilary Swank, Chloe Sevigny, and Peter Sarsgaard.I recommend viewers watch the movie first and learn about the actual case second, as I did.  I was absolutely shocked by one of the events at the end of the movie, and the film had more of an impact on me than it would have if I'd known exactly what was going to happen.The real Teena Brandon has probably been lost forever in the dramatization of her/his life and the subsequent political crossfire.  Both the left and the right seem to be caught up in discussing gay issues and tolerance. The tragedy of Teena Brandon is not one of intolerance (any guy who lies, steals, and seduces girls under false pretenses is not going to be tolerated.)  It is a tragedy of a person who was deeply unsatisfied with who she was, of a culture which labels people rather than accepting them as individuals, and of a couple of scumbags who felt that rape and murder were justifiable punishments for violating the unwritten male code of honor.

This movie is so emotionally enthralling and brutally realistic it hurts my heart to know that it is a true life story. A lot of people believe this is a gay movie but I need..no I HAVE to correct that misguided belief. In Brandon`s mind he was a boy and he had fallen in love with a girl the way boys do. There was nothing wrong with that considering Lana felt the same way about him. Lana knew the truth but chose to ignore it and see Brandon and not Teena, she did not care that he was really physically a she. This even makes it more painful to believe John and Tom are real life trash who could be so cruel. Only God knows why they did what they did. While watching this movie everyone somehow relates to Brandon Everyone has their own pain which masks into a secret which masks into a lie... and Brandon was tired of trying to live a lie that was not him. If only Brandon would of left that night......why didn`t he leave?I truly believe Hilary Swank and Chloe Sevigny have played the best and most important roles to be portrayed in this time. Hilary might have become more Brandon than Brandon was. She took on the character perfectly. She some became this handsome young man in his own personal war. Chloe made you feel the same intensity and want that Lana Tisdel felt. She deserved the Oscar, she earned it. Kimberley Pierce is beyond brilliant and should be noted above John Woo and Steven Spielberg. She has taken a life and turned it into a legacy.I`ve watched this movie more times than I can remember and every time tears stream down my face and I end up re-evaluating my life. Boys Don`t Cry makes you think. It makes you wonder was Brandon more powerful for having the heart to be who felt he really was or for going back to Falls City to be with Lana?!All you need is sympathy, compassion and a little bit understanding to love this movie and if you don`t its because you`re an example of why Brandon could not live the way he wanted to.Only God knows why this tragedy has become pure brilliance!

It was not so much, as some of the critics have said, a gay movie as it was the tragic story of a girl who was viscously murdered by hate and ignorance.  I watched in disbelief as a young girl who, despite her problems, tried her hardest to find a place for herself in life only for it to be ended in tragedy.  Chloe Sevigny was superb, and Hillary Swank's performance was so outstanding that at moments I felt as if I actually knew her.However, after speaking with others about the film, a film that I thought was one of the best I have seen this or any other year, I was baffled by what I heard.  I realized that for some reason it is so easy for us to watch movies in which people get their heads blown off, and everyone embraces it like it is no big deal. But as soon as a film is made that tackles the issue of any form of non-standard sexuality, we are all of a sudden a bunch of moral crusaders.  The character in this movie was a transsexual, yes she was, but more importantly she was a human being who died tragically and this is an amazing film that documents her life and death.  I recommend it to anyone who can rise above their own prejudices or likes/dislikes for certain kinds of people, and watch and be moved by an excellent film.

The movie is based on a real person and, with perhaps a bit of fictionalization, pretty much sticks to the facts. Born Teena Brandon, she felt that she was a man trapped in a woman's body. She began to dress and live as Brandon Teena, while preparing to eventually become a man. She never had the chance, and that is what the movie is about.Swank was so good in this movie, you absolutely forget that she is an actress. You actually see her character as a boy.

This incurs the wraths of Brandon's heretofore friends, John Lotter and Tom Nissen, both ex-cons.  What is impressive about Boys Don't Cry is that Peirce doesn't sensationalize the material, which is easily done in lesser hands with such subjects as gender-bending, rape, and murder. Nor does Peirce, a lesbian, exude an agenda.  Brandon is shown warts and all as a thief and habitual liar (about far more than his gender), while John and Tom are welcoming and amicable before they uncover Brandon's secret. Peirce even allows that John's loathing for Brandon may derive more from his jealousy of Lana than homophobia, though homophobia abets his actions.  Brandon does not come off as a martyr, but very much an individual. Brandon refuses the label of lesbian. The subtext is gender fluidity and the questioning of why we have to categorize sexual orientation at all.  Labels emphasize difference, and difference is a code word for misanthropy.Peirce intersperses wonderful time-lapse sequences of the horizon, the clouds, the stars, even a refinery throughout the film.  While these could just be throwaway flourishes, their beauty and timing point to a transcendent hope in the characters' dreams, no matter how stupid they may be, like Brandon's preoccupation with Memphis or Lana's wanting to become a karaoke singer.  Only at the end, does Pierce's romanticization get the better of her, in a fictional love scene between Lana and Brandon.The entire cast is superb.  Actress Hilary Swank holds nothing back in giving the character of Brandon brashness, longing, hope, naivete, and denial.  Matching her every step of the way is ChloÃ« Sevigny as Lana, and their chemistry together is wholly convincing.  Sevigny (along with Sarah Polley) is among the great actors of her generation.  Peter Sarsgaard imbues John with both humanity and barbarous malevolence.  In two smaller roles of great merit are Alicia Goranson, who plays Candace, Brandon's first friend in Falls City, and Jeanetta Arnette as Lana's outlandish mom.

Brandon Teena realized this 10 years ago. Since then, director and screenwriter Kimberly Pierce spun this tragedy into a suspenseful motion picture destined to amplify intolerance in the way `Schindler's List' portrayed the holocaust.Brandon Teena (Hilary Swank), or Teena Brandon, grew up most of her life as a girl. However, her preferences gravitated to male behavior. Hence, she began stuffing her crotch with socks and cropping her hair short. Her behavior drew ire from her neighbors as they chase her to her friend's trailer and nearly beat her senseless. Not only that, but she's in trouble with the law for grand theft auto. In an attempt to flee her tarnished life, she transplants herself from native Lincoln, Neb. to Falls City where no one suspects her identity-until clues pop up.She meets kind-hearted Candace, who offers her a place to stay. Soon she encounters angst-ridden Lana (Chloe Sevigny), whom she instantly fancies.Lana, on the other hand, tires of her mundane life and comes across nearly unapproachable. Soon, the two develop an awkward friendship that develops into a love affair. Her friend John (Peter Sarsgaard), who doesn't hide his infatuation with Lana, develops a blinding jealousy towards Brandon. Finally, Candace's discovery of Brandon's personal items yield a witch hunt for her true identity. Herein lie the tragic circumstances of the movie.Acting surpasses that of any big-budget production. Hilary Swank's transformation from comely Hollywood starlet to tomboy is nearly unbelievable. Swank is a straight woman convincingly playing a lesbian. Her love for Lana appears nearly genuine as scenes of intimacy clearly demonstrate. Her seven various awards, including best actress at the Academy Awards, speak for themselves. It's clear that she brings personal experience to this film; she was born in Lincoln, Neb.Supporting characters were also superlative. Chloe Sevigny compliments Swank perfectly. She echoes trailer-park desolation with disillusionment, particularly in the early '90s economic downturn. John's and Tom's (Brendan Sexton, Jr.) characters portray typical redneck country boys.Kimberly Pierce's direction brings avant-garde filmmaking to a real-life story. It could have easily come across as Lifetime's movie of the week, had it not been for the cast and her direction. She uses innovative camera techniques such as fast motion shots and new angles mixed with colorful backdrops reminiscent of the film `Amelie.' At the same time, she amplifies the misery of Falls City.Themes, as you would have guessed, deal with gender identity and gay issues. You feel infuriated by both the law and the simple-minded yokels of Nebraska for not taking a stand for Brandon's harassment. Does any human deserve this kind of treatment? Absolutely not. The film forces you to think, and for some people that can be a problem.Be forewarned this is not the feel-good movie of the decade; it was never meant to be that way. It shines the spotlight on hatred and bigotry while teaching us about ourselves.

It must have been tempting to do with this story what Lifetime Movies for Women or Hallmark might have done -- turn it into the tale of a prophet without honor in her own country.  (I'll call Teena Brandon her.) The movie deftly avoids this kind of mindless simplicity.  Brandon is actually pretty screwed up, even before the movie begins, and not just in regard to her gender role, not just in the easy way that would encourage our sympathy and allow us to feel self righteous because we can identify with her plight.  No, she steals cars (grand theft auto), drinks, cusses, can't seem to hold a job, and acts in other ways that violate our ordinary bourgeois moral codes.  Her pecadillos aren't dwelled on, that would be going too far, but they're noted nonetheless.So, yes, she's somewhat off kilter, but considering the subculture she is part of, that's almost a requirement for membership in good standing. What a bunch of garbage this community is!  And, not that she's drawn to it, but that she simply finds herself living with these folks.  The possibility of some other life style doesn't seem to occur to her.  It's perfectly natural. Most of us would find ourselves uncomfortable in trying to establish connections in a social world different from the one we're used to. (That's why cities are divided into ethnic neighborhoods and why lots of Scandinavians immigrated to Minnesota and why there are biker bars and why Leominster, Massachussetts, is mostly Seventh Day Adventist.  Or, to put it in highly technical terms, birds of a feather feel more comfortable flocking together.)  So Brandon, Hillary Swank, puts up with these nuts because she believes that, after all, this is what life is like.  They're a pretty crummy bunch from our point of view, particularly the men.  They drink beer not for recreation but to maintain a certain blood level, they smoke (always a bad sign), they drive recklessly and defy the law, tote guns and knives, rape and beat people, scarify themselves and each other, and generally behave reprehensibly.  They tolerate all this in one another. They more or less have to, because that's how they themselves behave.  You can't criticize someone who acts just like you.  In fact they tolerate everything except lying or cross-dressing, which is kind of a surprise. (In prison, the inmates at the top of the social ladder are murderers and armed robbers, those at the bottom have been convicted of molesting children or shoplifting.)The performers put it all across too.  Skaarsgard is the main heavy, ultimately the mass murderer, and he's fine.  Lots of actors underplay the part of the heavy, smiling ruthlessly while fondling the knife, gently whispering orders like, You can start by taking them clothes off. Skaarsgard does it better.  He tosses off orders and threats with a half-laugh and a shrug, as if advising you that you have a bit of spinach stuck on your front tooth.  Don't ever do that again, he tells Brandon after she does something wrong, and a moment later he is berserk, throwing everyone out of his car on a deserted rural road.  His main man isn't any better.  Hillary Swank is fine as Brandon.  Her sharp, angular features contrast with the fleshier nose and more rounded contours of Chloe Sevigny as Lana.  There is a startling shot of them concocting the story they are going to tell the boys, when the director frames their faces next to one another and the scene changes, without their faces changing, to their actual explanation taking place.  It's out of Bergman's Persona, maybe, but it is just as smooth as a spoonful of Ben and Jerry's Ice Cream.  I must say, though, that Swank is a delightful looking and attractive woman, but as a man she doesn't appeal to me at all.  Chloe Sevigny is a different matter, with her tawny skin, burnt orange hair, hooded eyelids, and that enchanting mole on her left breast.That reminds me.  I'm a little confused about something here.  Okay, Brandon is a woman, anatomically normal as far as anyone can see.  So's her girlfriend Lana.  Now, here they are, making out for the first time on a hilltop under one of the towers carrying power lines, a weird, insidious, and totally appropriate humming whine on the sound track, occasional shots of the static horizon with the sky behind it zipping along in accelerated motion.  Let me see if I have the sequence of events correct.  They kiss. Lana takes off her top so there's no question of her sex.  Brandon is the active pursuer.  She doesn't undress.  She performs cunnilingus on Sevigny, or that's what's suggested.  Am I going too fast? asks Brandon.  Then she climbs on top of her, reaches down and adjusts something, and heaves gently forward, while Sevigny gives a very good imitation of being penetrated. Sevigny also glances down and notices that, strangely, Brandon has womanly breasts.  Afterward Sevigny briefly carresses Brandon's fly before Brandon withdraws the hand.  Then Sevigny guides Brandon into a supine position and snuggles up on top of her, saying, Don't be afraid, Brandon.Okay, now what exactly has transpired in a physical sense?  I don't mean to be gross.  We can respect the fact that the two people love each other. That's made clear.  But the movie invites questions about the more material aspects of their relationship, and it's frustrating that we don't have the answers.  It's like finishing a difficult jigsaw puzzle and finding that the last few pieces are missing.  Earlier we've noticed that Brandon has a dildo packed in her baggage.  Does that figure into this scene somehow?  And later, when Sevigny visits Brandon in jail, she's surprised to find her friend locked up in the woman's section, and goes about telling others in the most convincing way that Brandon is a great lover -- and a man.  Until near the end when the two are in a bare shack together.  By this time, Lana has been given an irrefutable demonstration that Brandon is a woman.  The two nevertheless make love again, although this time Sevigny says, I'm not sure I know how to do this.  What was she doing all those times BEFORE?In interviews, the real Lana seems an intelligent and sensible young woman. I don't recall her mentioning that Brandon was a great lover but she does carry on about how sensitive and caring Brandon was.  I supposed Brandon must have seemed so to Lana.  Especially when it's taken into account that the only men we meet are sadistic, half-mad rapists who beat and pummel Brandon for lying.  You know you brought this on yourself, don't you? one of them asks after having brutally sodomized her.  (I wondered every once in a while, doesn't this Dogpatch have any normal guys living in it?)  That rape scene, by the way, is plain horrifying, the most graphic and repellant I've seen on screen since Berman's The Virgin Spring.  It has ten times the shock power of similar scenes, like that in Victim.  As a male, I had the feeling for the first time of what it means to refer to rape as a violation.  Brandon's post-rape interrogation by the law is even worse on tape than it is in this movie, though the script follows it word for word. Here, the sheriff sounds matter of fact, puzzled.  In the real interview it seems clear that this Neanderthal was sexually aroused, anxious to have her talk about it, who popped her and where, and, Did ya have to help him out a little?  Did ya, huh?  What'd you do?  On the tape he begins to inquire into subjects like what it's like for lesbians to make love and Brandon answers very sensibly, I don't see what this has to do with what happened Saturday night.  There is nudity here, absolutely none of it is thrown in to titillate the audience.  It's strictly functional.  Even a shower scene with Brandon, with a brief glimpse of Hillary Swank's buttocks, doesn't offend.  (DePalma would have lingered over it in slow motion.  He would have done everything except enter the frame himself and point to the most interesting body parts so you wouldn't overlook them.)Lana and her family and friends refer continually in interviews to Brandon's knowing what a woman wants, her charm, her sensitivity, but this isn't overstressed here.  Brandon never brings anybody flowers or anything.  And consideration isn't always a source of man's appeal for woman, or at least that's the impression one gets.  I tried it once and my partner said, You don't have to be so gentle with me.The director makes visual statements from time to time, but only in ways that work.  There are, as I've mentioned in passing, several shots in accelerated motion.  A silent night-time factory with a stack that spews smoke at an alarming rate.  A moon that dips in a perceptible arc toward the horizon.  Other odd shots, including one that seems to have been printed in reverse so that the car headlights maintain a set interval from the camera but the asphlat beneath them is zipping towards us, which means the car is traveling rearward at high speed.  It's barely noticeable but effective, because it contributes another disturbing note to a movie that is filled with them.  Another shot in which the entire screen is filled with a dramatic pattern of bright light and scarcely visible criss-crossing highlights, like a deranged Mondrian, until the camera dollies back and we see that it is the blazing headlight of a car.Overall, this is a fine movie.  It respects the audience.  It doesn't go for easy tears.  It doesn't beatify the hapless heroin.  It's a tragic story told with a mixture of naturalism and impressionism, that asks something of the viewer without giving the viewer an opportunity to feel self satisfied. It's a rare quality these days.

I was surprised not by how good her performance was, but how brave she was in really throwing herself whole-hog into the role and truly becoming a man. Her performance adds another vast dimension to the movie, particularly as I feel that in her performance alone does the character's motivation come through. You can sense just how exciting it is for her to flirt with becoming free of her gender, even if what she's doing is getting in a bar fight or doing stupid stunts on the back of a pickup. You can sense her euphoria at getting a taste of the experience of being a man. This creates the motivation for her character, as the man she wants to be IS the kind of guy who would get hurt and get into the kind of trouble she does. This is one case where the performance really IS one third of what the film as a whole is and I would have no problem with Hillary Swank walking off with the best actress Oscar.I am surprised that so many people said the film was poorly directed. I think that Pierce has definitely watched her share of David Lynch films and uses what she's learned to cast an air of unreality and mythological significance to the events. I thought the sex scene was particularly good, because you see on Lana's face how Brandon is pleasing her in ways that her other boyfriends couldn't possibly. This is much more subtly done than in other lesbian films, where a character would probably have a line like well everyone knows only a woman knows what a woman wants or something else-- this film is more powerful because it doesn't preach or be too heavy-handed. It is not without viewpoint, but it handles the matter subtly. I was VERY surprised at another reviewer who seems to think it is the mark of directorial inadequacy to show a face and breast in the same shot... I'm sorry, where did that rule come from?It's a little frustrating watching the movie just how stupid Brandon is, but hey, it's a true story and the film makes him out to be stupid and unstable from the start.I myself am a gay man, and as such I found this film's tagline A true story about finding the courage to be yourself entirely disgusting. This is not about finding the courage to be yourself, it's about messed-up people who are at the mercy of forces within themselves that are beyond their control. It's about people who are so undersocialized that they have no way of knowing how to deal with the emotions that they feel. I am so sick of the whole marketing slant of Being-gay-is-just-such-a-heartwarming-growing-experience that I truly want to vomit. I would like to think that someone out there could credit gay people with enough intelligence to accept that not everything about being gay or lesbian in the late 90's is a wonderful, warm, and affirming experience.

Cutting her hair, finding herself in a new city, and changing her name to Brandon Teena, she passed herself off as a man and befriended a group of lower-class kids who adored the sweet and gentle new boy in town. Falling in love with one of the girls in the group, Brandon suddenly found it increasingly hard to hide his true identity. Struggling with his past and desperate in his current situation, Brandon's life was placed in jeopardy when his companions learned his true identity. This film is based on a true story.Kimberly Peirce's picture BOYS DON'T CRY is nothing short of a monumental achievement in so-called indie filmmaking. So many films lately indulge themselves with laughable attempts at moral and high-mindedness. BOYS is the type of film that lays it all out, warts and all. It paints Brandon as a martyr, I'll fully admit that, but what the picture does with such dexterity is deliver a story so heartbreaking and so absolute that your body is numb for 112 minutes of screen time. I found only a handful of films have been able to achieve that this year. The fact that this narrative really happened six years ago sent a chill up my spine. Fiction can take you to limitless places. Fact nails you firmly to the Earth. Not enough movies dare you to enter the dark places in our own backyard.But what would BOYS be without Hilary Swank? Nothing. This young actress was previously seen on BEVERLY HILLS 90210 and in the little seen (and gentle) feature THE NEXT KARATE KID. She's unknown to most people and that little fact alone is mainly the reason she is so brilliant as the doomed Brandon. It's tough to imagine a A-list name in the complex lead role. With Swank, you get an actress that can come out of left field and makes you accept with the rest of the characters that she is portraying a man. It goes far deeper that a short haircut and bonded breasts. That's easy. Swank is mesmerizing with her toothy grin and cut-glass jawbone. She submerges all her femininity and comes up with a believable male persona. Beautiful as a boy or a girl, I cannot fathom another performance quite like Swank's coming out of any current performer alive today. She is brilliant as Brandon Teena. A role, I would say, she was born to play.Director Peirce backs Swank with a healthy cast of talented actors to play the white trash teens that befriend Brandon. Uttering a Beer? instead of a normal greeting like Hello, both Peter Sarsgaard and Brendan Sexton III deliver menacing performances as the two men who instigate the violence toward Brandon. Long lost Alicia Goranson (TV's Becky on ROSEANNE) makes for a sweet presence as a shy girl attracted to Brandon. But it's really Chloe Sevigny (GUMMO, KIDS) who almost matches Swank in the acting department. It's her brave performance as Brandon's initially clueless lover that makes you want to cry. Deeply in love, yet conflicted with Brandon's sexual ambiguity, Sevigny is mighty to behold.This being Peirce's debut feature, BOYS is often dramatically daring and optically unique. I like the way she portrays the small Nebraska town with a loving eye for the trashy, yet positive humanity of it's citizens. It's their deep loving nature that initially welcomes Brandon. It's their intolerance and stupidity that eventually brings him down. With almost every frame, Peirce makes strong statements about the duality of the cliched midwestern heart. I also give Peirce credit for making a rape scene horrifying without being exploitative. That's the sign of a director who cares about the audience.BOYS DON'T CRY is spectacular picture. A truly involving piece of work that shines all around. As devastating as this story is, the film is always dramatically commanding. Kimberly Peirce is a new director to behold. She has delivered a art-house film that finally makes on it's promise to be truthful to the subject and never waver to the easy path. Don't miss this film.---------- 10  "},{"Title":"A kick in the stomach.

It narrates the story of Teena Brandon who pretends being a boy. In the beginning, she rodeo-rides a car, behaves like a man, and is integrated into the family of her girlfriend she finally falls in love with. This ultimately turns out be her biggest mistake, leading to her death, because the two redneck brothers of her girlfriend don't like freaks. She is beaten, violated, and ultimately shot to death. What made me feeling sick and sad after this movie is not only the violence depicted, that is never gratuitous or superfluous. What made me feel bad is that there is a growing tendency in the world to inhumanity, intolerance and hate against all that is different. Therefore is a good contribution to the discussion what makes violence happen, how it happens and, above all, where it happens. The two redneck brothers depicted in the movie are chanceless, dumb and prone to alcohol. Unfortunately, this combination leads to a climate of intolerance and violence, something we can witness in a strong extent in today's European societies. This film should be watched by classes etc. and to be discussed about. And outstanding performance is delivered by Hillary Swank!!

However with the 1999 film, Boys Don't Cry, it has been hard to do so. I do like it, but it does push the limit to what I like in a movie. Brandon Teena or Teena Brandon, whichever name you want to call this character, was incredible on two fronts. One, on how she kept up the appearance of being a man to the public where she was living, and two, how she still handled the issues of being a woman. This is one of the most confronting, disturbing and brilliant movies of our time.This is true story about Brandon Teena, a person whose living a very complex and dysfunctional life. While everything seems normal on outside, with this extremely charming man, all is not as it seems. Brandon suffers from S.I.C (Sexual Identity Crisis). Nebraska's newest citizen is hiding a deep dark secret. From middle America emerged an extraordinary double life, a complicated love story and a crime that would shatter the heartland for many years.Considering that an independent filmmaker made this film, I still found that it was a very professional one. The director, Kimberly Peirce, did a grand job in bring this to the screen. I am certain that the deep research that would have been needed, was one of the big reasons to the success of this film. I like the way that Peirce shot the film, in a quick paced sort of a way, as if Brandon was on some sort of a rollercoaster that he could not control. Then in a very subtle way would slow certain scenes to hold a very long-lasting affect on the audience. The cinematographer also does a good job of projecting what the director wants us to see. This task was left to Jim Denault. The script was very good to this film. I am sure that all the characters as they were written for in the bigscreen, would have behaved just like this in real life. This again is to the credit of Peirce and her co writer, Andy Bienen.Then the cast that this film had was an extraordinary one. There is not much you can criticize about Hilary Swank's role. It was perfect, and she thoroughly deserved the Academy Award for her work. Her role is a fitting tribute to the life of Brandon Teena. I remember Swank saying that she had to physically live like a man for a certain amount of time, so she could capture who Brandon Teena was. In fact Swank does scrub up pretty well, and was a good choice to play a man. I also like Swank's role in the 1994 movie, The next Karate Kid.I also liked the role of Lana, played by ChloÃ« Sevigny. She was Brandon's onscreen girlfriend. Now from where I see it, this role was the pivotal one for the whole movie, as it gave an insight into how Brandon could pick up nice girls. I really liked the onscreen chemistry between both Swank and Sevigny. The actors who also played the bad men, John Lotter and Tom Nissen, Peter Sarsgaard and Brendan Sexton III, scarily resemble their real life characters. While their roles were disturbing, I like how they were performed.This movie has some gruesome scenes attached to it. However they gave an accurate portrayal of what really happened. I enjoyed the scenes where Brandon is going out into the world as a man, trying to pick up the girls that he likes. It is amazing how he got away with being a man to so many girls for so long. Then take the hardy scenes to the film. Scenes such as the discovery of Brandon being a girl, as both Lotter and Nissen violate her civil rights. Then there is the vile rape scene, which is cleverly interweaved with the sheriff's harsh integration of Brandon, when he continually pushes Brandon to admit that he was sexually assaulted. Then I would have to say the murder of Teena is one of the most horrible pieces of cinema I have ever seen. Imagining being in such a situation is a sickening thought. All these scenes are brilliantly written and acted in my mind.From where I see it, people such as Brandon Teena, did not deserve to be treated in such a harsh way, by either her murderers or the law enforcers. It is no wonder that such movements as the Gay rights activists and 'the transsexual menace', use Teena's name to help fight for justice for transsexuals and people who suffer S.I.C (Sexual Identity Crisis). If Brandon was given a little help and support, perhaps s\he might still be alive today. I hope that if I was to meet characters like Brandon that I would not be quick to judge them, but instead help treat their problem and accept them into the community. Remember they are still human beings, whether they think they are a man or a woman.I can understand that some people might not like some of the content that is in this movie, but I question if people simply hate the entire film. What were you expecting to see, a 'feel good' movie? This film was not that, in fact it was quite the opposite. Well I feel this is a brilliant film, with a tremendously talented cast. It also handles a delicate situation with 'gritty' class. It is a remarkable role from Swank, considering she was once 'the next karate kid', and then became the girl who lived her life as a man, a life that was not only foolish, but extremely dangerous. This film will shake you up, in a way that only it can.

I had seen a couple of documentaries on Teena Brandon before I saw this film, and the film keeps all the details.

The acting in this film is incredible, Chloe Sevingy is yet again brilliant. Hilary Swank does an amazing job at portraying the deep emotional struggles of Brandon ( although I do wish they would have considered casting a trans actor to play a trans character). No one around Brandon accepts or supports him but his girlfriend (played by Chloe Sevingy). When the small, intolerant town learn that Brandon is trans (he doesn't identify with the gender he was assigned at birth, which was female) they all turn against him. This movie is very honest and genuine, portraying the horrific struggles that trans people face still to this day. From the police man's victim blaming and transphobia to the vile and sickening attack and eventual murder of Brandon. Although this movie is not just about trans struggles, it studies many other issues of being lost and confused but still having hope. I'm sure all audiences will have an emotional response to this movie. Trigger Warning there is a very intense rape scene, which is likely to distress all viewers. It's upsetting that several past user reviews which I have read on IMDb have been extremely incorrect. To call Brandon a girl dressing as a boy or a girl trying to be a boy is very offensive. Brandon was a boy, genitals do not tell you someones gender!!! Also people saying that this is a lesbian movie or that it's about Brandon's sexual identity, this movie is centered around Brandon's gender identity which is completely unrelated to sexual orientation. This movie should teach people about how complex gender really is, and it does it extremely well, while being extremely truthful and blunt. It's an incredible film, but one that will leave you feeling stunned and emotional. You need to see it.

It is based on the tragic case of Teena Brandon (Hilary Swank) who was raped and murdered in 1993, it would become one of the significant cases of hate crime in American history.From the off Kimberly Peirce's film sets out its stall that we are in bleak territory, and so it proves. It dangles little shards of light, but constantly it proves uncompromising and unpleasant. There's a nagging irk that main characters are very thinly drawn, where motives are given short shrift, and this is bizarre given that the pic runs for nearly two hours. However, the performances of both Swank and ChloÃ« Sevigny are outstanding, and Peirce handles the darkest scenes in the movie with a grace and tact that deserves applause.

The title of the film is taken from 'Boys Don't Cry by the rock band The Cure.This film tackles on some heavy subject matter about transgender and the story is very thought-provoking enough for viewers raise questions dealing with the subject matter, especially since this is based on events that happened in real life. Director Kimberly Peirce and the writers with the story as well as the characters very genuine and maturely, and I think it pays a good tribute to the real-life story of Teena Brandon. The characters are beautifully written, the main character Brandon Teena (or Teena Brandon) in particular, and the story really comes to life by an amazing, if not excellent script. Hilary Swank's performance is nothing short of fantastic, she really brings such light to her role and viewers can tell that she is really committed to the role. The fact that she won an Oscar for her performance is no surprise. The rest of cast did quite a credible job as well. Then the story moves pretty good throughout its the film's run and manages to stay intriguing for the most time. The first half of the film is very light-hearted and soft-spoken, then the second half gets quite powerful and upsetting in tone. As the themes of the film are heavy, there are some scenes that get quite poignant and aggressively uncomfortable to watch, especially for viewers who have dealt with similar situations. But overall, this film really honest and grounded in a way where viewers are able to connect with the characters and the story. The only real flaw with the film is that it fails to explain the reason behind the Brandon's transgender or her background that gives hints as to why she adopted a male identity to begin with.Boys Don't Cry is a powerful and thought-provoking.

Only problem though is it tends to ignore the more flawed aspects of the character. The real life person had quite a criminal record, and while they do mention this several times in the movie, I never felt they truly explored that side of the character. The film instead decided to focus more on making the audience care about the main character, which is fine, I just would have liked both aspects of the character to have been touched on with equal amounts.

However, i didn't value the shifting between the mode towards the end, which was shifting way too fast.

Aside from being a historical acting performance- (Hillary Swank best actress Academy Award), this film is of the most daring, courageous films ever made. For director Kimberly Peirce to keep this story together, and for all these actors to have the courage sign on to this, and give such committed performances... it's a wonderful dance to watch. Truly a must see film. It's intense and hard to watch at times; but it does what few films do. It takes you on a ride- it keeps you guessing; it makes you love, hate, laugh and cry. This is the true story of a trans-gender female turning male named Tina Brandon (played by Hillary Swank). Brandon, running from his past, moves to a small town in Nebraska and manages to convince his peers that he is a male. He falls for a girl named Lana (Chloe Sevigny). The love between Hillary Swank and Chloe Sevigny is real. It's innocent, it's dysfunctional, it's sensual, and sexual (Brandon makes love to her using a fake penis- and actually pulls it off! no pun intended). You feel bad for Lana because she's being lied to, and you feel bad for Brandon at the same time because you know their love is real- and you know the truth and Brandon's past is going to get found out sooner or later. Despite all the tension, you feel happy for them because they're both experiencing something real, regardless of what the truth is. But you're also scared for them because there are dangerous people in their immediate surroundings. Brandon is the outsider into Lana's volatile, low income family and peers. When Brandon is detained for charges that arose prior to his relocation, he is placed in the women's section of the Falls City prison. Lana bails him out and asks why he was in the women's prison. He lies again saying he's a hermaphrodite- but Lana declares her love for him no matter what he is. But the word is out on Tina Brandon in the newspaper, and suspicions arise among local homophobic, neurotic, maniacs who are determined to find out the truth, regardless of anyone's happiness. One of the main threads of this film is embarrassment. You fear for Brandon. You know what she's doing is wrong, but you really don't want her to get caught. She is so genuine as Brandon. You really feel for her/him. You completely accept Hillary Swank as a young man. No need to explain the climax or more details of this intricate plot, as this is a must see film. The way the story turns and how the characters arc is is really fascinating. This is a film you won't forget.

This is not a film for everyone, however; it is frequently brutal and depressing in the emotional honesty of its story. That said, anyone interested should absolutely give this film a look. The film is based upon true events and the tragic circumstances of Brandon Teena (Hilary Swank), a trans man dealing with a sexual identity crisis. She wants to be seen as a man desperately, and because she unwisely acts upon her instincts, she ends up raped and dead by the end of the film. She realizes too late that she can't run from her past completely. Brandon remains a fully sympathetic character, and much of this is due to Swank's masterful performance. She has a sense of innocence about her, as she desires to find her place in the world and become the person who she wants to be, but she forgets to think about the consequences. She flies too close to the sun and ultimately pays the price for it. Ironically, she is one of the few characters in the movie fully willing to seek what she wants. The family she stays with for much of the film lives a morally and emotionally empty life. Only the daughter, Lana (Chloe Sevigny) seems to recognize this; she hates her working-class job and the dangers she frequently has to face around ex-convict John Lotter (Peter Saarsgard). Regardless of her gender, it is no wonder she ends up falling for Brandon. Both hate societal norms and wish to escape to Memphis to live better lives together. They both ultimately find themselves unable to, as Lotter has his own perspective on those societal norms, and he simply can't take any variations. He's a monster, yes, but his motivation for raping and murdering Brandon is one of confusion. He can't comprehend that the concept of gender isn't as simplistic as he thought, and more importantly, that the world isn't as simplistic as it seems. This is a difficult movie to watch, as it has the level of impact akin to that of a classical Greek tragedy. Brandon is unable to overcome her fatal flaw, and it ends up costing her her life. However, it is also extremely insightful and touching with regards to her courage to go and pursue her desires.

Because part of the movie takes place in a rural area, I guess the directors/producers think that the populace is dumb; thus, they give them southern drawls.This is offensive to me on two fronts First, I was raised in the South, and I see this 'dumb hick' stereotyping as condescension--nothing new, of course; it has gone on forever. Anyone who has a southern accent is an idiot, in the eyes of Hollywood. Secondly, it is simply inaccurate. People in Nebraska don't say, 'lahhhht' for the word, 'light,' and so on. The whole movie was made laughable by the ridiculous attachment of a Southern drawl to almost every character! This is not to say that the characters were anything but low-life, ignorant fools; most certainly were that! Their lifestyles--the constant smoking, drinking, drugs, loose living, etc.--made them stupid, however--NOT their accents. Their lifestyle contributed to their lack of compassion--NOT the place where they lived. "},{"Title":"Gritty and Honest Boys Should Cry","Date":"8 August 2011","Score":"","Genre":"Biography, Drama, Romance","Review":" Nothing short of full blown heart wrenching, pit-of-the-stomach empathetic cinema, and it's all possible because of the uncompromising and unsurpassed Kimberly Peirce and Hilary Swank. The striking story of a man, who was tragically born a woman, flows through the actors with ease and a disturbingly coarse elegance. Brandon Teena, Hilary Swank's finest more pure role to date, is a dimensional and wholly real character; complete with cracks and sharp edges. Using simplistic expression and body language to become a man, Swank managed to defy audiences and actually BE a man for most of the duration of the film. The impact and force of Swank's emotions drove the entire story and formed a pragmatic relationship with Chloe Sevigny's Lana. Sevigny, commonly known for her off-the-cuff indie roles, broke down all the walls of supporting character, and stood resolutely against the back-drop of Nebraska&#x97;freed, broken, gorgeous, ordinary, delicate, bursting. When mentioning those snubbed at the Oscars, Sevigny should always be listed primarily, not only because she created a character so wretchedly real, but because she was still the angelic force, the unfamiliar loveliness, that kept the film so exclusively mystic and magical. Down to earth and exceptionally betraying, the film's tone manages to never stray from authenticity; either a soft enjoyment of romance, or a pounding fury with life's futility. No matter what is being felt, it is being experienced by the audience too. Peter Sarsgard, Brandan Sexton, Alison Folland, Alicia Goranson, and Jeanetta Arnette all deserve their individual sentences, whether describing how masterfully they manage to terrify or how innocently they evoke tenderness, but my skipping over their descriptions simply means they are too intricate and individual to express. Without the charming and harrowing screenplay there would be no brilliance to discuss, no heart-break to mend, but beyond this, without Kimberly Peirce there would be no Boys Don't Cry. Her devotion to the complete portrayal of Brandon was the ultimate success of the film. Not once did she compromise the character's emotional state, rather she found an array of images and framing choices to complete what would have otherwise been campy or simply B. Moments of complete immersion in Lana and Brandon's love were left rolling; not cut for censorship, but shown for what it was. Peirce made the film whole, and let the audience revel in what a boy is. Overall, Boys Don't Cry was a work of character, not simply the perfection created by Swank and Sevingy, but the work of all the film's gifted actors and perceptive director. A must see film for every child who is confused, for every adult with a prejudice, for every person who has ever loved a film, and for anyone who needs to be shown a gritty and ingenuous honesty.

Where is the actor for Phillip Devine? Some people think that adding his character to the story is not vital but I think it is. It shows just how cowardly and evil John Lotter and Tom Nissen actually were.Another aspect that I noticed was how the Sheriff was pretty tame in the movie. If you go back and find the true story or hear the audio somehow...you will see that the Sheriff who actually interviewed her was very inappropriate and unprofessional.I cannot think of another movie so far where the actors fit so much with the real life people. Casting did such a great job finding the characters for John Lotter and Brandon Teena. Both Hilary Swank and John Peter Sarsgaard get 10/10 stars from me in their performance.This movie ends up being emotional because Lana (Chloe Sevigny) loses two people. One of her friends and another she dearly loves. It ends up being emotional because of the cruel thoughtless acts carried out by Lotter and Nissen.9/10 MSMITH "}{"Title":"Boys Don't Cry is a movie about a transsexual man, NOT a girl.","Date":"10 June 2010","Score":"","Genre":"Biography, Drama, Romance","Review":" As usual people seek to make transsexual people invisible by appropriating their stories. Brandon Teena was a straight, transsexual man. Not a girl or a lesbian. Although he didn't live long enough to receive medical treatment, that fact does not take away from his identity. He was always male and in time he would have transitioned so that his body matched his mind. This movie is a graphic illustration of the transphobia that STILL exists in this country. Brandon was simply trying to be himself and a couple insecure men choose to attack him for it. Violence is never the answer and in this case it was a HATE CRIME. Brandon was murdered simply because of the way he was born (transsexual). Hopefully this movie will help educate people about transsexualism and such incidents will become fewer in number or better yet eliminated. Rest in peace Brandon.

It's a real life story! Also, for the record, I cannot think of a single artwork which has produced significant political or moral change. While a good few have become symbols for a cause (Miller's 'The Crucible' against the Red-scare, Dylan's 'Blowin in the Wind' against segregation, Picasso's 'Guernica' against Franco's war) I don't think we should give Boys Don't Cry extra credit for presenting a harsh depiction of the horrors of prejudice, nor should we take credit away if we don't think it will have any effect on the moral fibre of our generation. It is, after all, just a film, albeit one of a real and tragic life.I'll agree with the comments that the cinematography was nothing special - but must a film have amazing cinematography? i think it had some understatedly beautiful shots when and only when appropriate (along with the sped up landscape shots - check out the Brandon-eye-view of Lana through the factory window - a beautiful shot depicting Brandon admiration for her). Other than that, this is a distinctly human drama and the shots served its purpose perfectly.

I should regret I did not leave.This is another movie where the topic has been awarded and not the picture itself. Although I can sympathize with trans-genders' certainly faced everyday disturbing issues, I can not think of anything in this movie that would enhance their situation in any way. The story is violent mainly, and not revealing or fairly touching or interesting in any manner. Both Hilary Swank and ChloÃ© Sevigny are doing their parts nicely, though.The plot has flaws such as Lana is not angry at all after her love interest turns out to be a woman. By that time the viewer also had to endure a painful love scene between the two. Nothing, well, strange, got noticed there, you see. And nobody minds in the end. Right.The rest of the story depicts the depreciating, hopeless area in which the characters reside. Nothing is said of, let's say, memories of Swank's character on how she turned out to be this way (born like it? trauma? woke up like it?), although I think it would be very important to enable the viewer to form an opinion. In case this has been left vague for a purpose, well, I do not believe that the viewers should not be allowed their opinions. It would have helped build the character. This way, Brendon remains a mystery. Why not wait until the OP is over and try find a lesbian girl-friend in the meantime? The reaction of the bad guys is not justifiable in any means, please do not get me wrong, but it is true that finding out that your buddy is a girl really could disturb anybody. I understand the movie is based on a real-life drama and I feel very sorry for the real Brandon. I had the impression that this movie is just using its topic to gain attention but does not give answers, or, although this would be the least to be expected, does not raise any questions.The two points go for the brave choice of the basic topic and the good performances. Everything else has fallen too short.

As the highways of the midwest are supplanted in speeded film with a starry night (a touching effect), the main character's lives are just like them. Moving too fast but not going anywhere, but it sure is beautiful but in an emotionally devestating way. Of the movies I have viewn none has been as touchingly romantic yet also so engrossingly about life as this one.Our protagonist is Brandon Teena or Teena Brandon, a midwestern Transsexual but that not being his/her defining trait. Teena is the product of a lonesome, deliquint and relatively stationary childhood, admitting that she/he never has left the Lincoln area let alone Nebraska. We meet Teena just after she has gone on a date and is skimping out on a court date. Soon she heads to a town so small that it is not on the map and becomes ingratiated with a family, involving ex-cons and falls in love but in a way that is so viscerally desperate yet unadulterdly emotional that truly it is one of the most realistically powerful romances ever felt on screen. I do not exaggerate when I saw it captures the real emotion of that type of love unlike any other film out there.What happens is inevitable, considering its based on an actual story, yet the romance is so beautiful and so true, it almost feels as if the film enters into a realm beneath the material. It's still amazing, but a part of me thinks that the story may have been better suited had it opted to coda in a different way. It almost feels as though a film that is American slice-of-life in the greatest of ways moves into a different genre and though it is still superb filmaking, I could have imagined it as something that in style fit more with what had come before it.

The film is based on the life of Teena Brandon, a woman who felt she was man trapped in a woman's body and attempted to live her life as a man. Hillary Swank won her first Oscar for Best Actress in a Leading Role for her powerhouse performance as Teena, who changed her name to Brandon Teena and attempted to live her life as a man. This film has little to do with homosexuality. As a matter of fact, early on in the film, when her best friend refers to her as a lesbian, she blows a gasket. This encounter, coupled with problems with the law, force Brandon on the road to a new life where he meets a shy young factory worker, played by Chloe Sevigny, and begins a romance with her, which is complicated by her friend (Peter Sarsgaard)whose constant challenging of Brandon in Sevigny's life leads to an inevitable and tragic showdown. The performances by Swank, Sarsgaard, and Sevigny (also nominated for Best Supporting Actress) are nothing short of mesmerizing. A truly adult motion picture experience, this film features some uncompromising violence and a very graphic rape scene. Once you have the children safely tucked in bed and if you have the stomach for it, treat yourself to what was probably the most powerful film to be released in 1999. You've never seen anything like this and never will again.

None are portrayed without their good sides, and every single one is likable, most of the time.  And yet each person in the film has some weakness that leads inexorably to a tragic end... every one makes you want to yell you idiot! at least once... and lest ye think that these reviews have given the whole story away- they haven't.The film is a telling of a true tale, without alterations to the major facts, leaving it free from clichÃ©. There's no gay agenda here. Look closely and it's hard to tell if there are any truly gay characters. Brandon, a self-professed messed up girl, begins the film with the delusion that she's a straight male.  Lana thinks she's dating a man, tries ignoring the biological truth, but in the end hesitates when Brandon looks a little bit girlish.  This is no Torch Song Trilogy, there are no parables here. It's a history in the Shakespearian sense.What can we learn from this history?  There are many angles... from a law and order perspective, both Brandon and her friends/tormentors committed property crimes and paid with jail time.  Her murderers, well, they rape and kill, and are sentenced to life in jail.  Brandon at her worst was a con, but was condemned to a life of fear and a brutal death.  It is hard not to feel sympathy for a person suffering cruel and unusual punishments.And history remembers the living best.  A where are they now blurb states the whereabouts of the living protagonists.  Presumably those killed are now six feet under.  It is odd to criticize the choice of who was mentioned after the film.From an acting perspective- it goes back to the weaknesses.  Every cast member sets you up to like their character, then shows their less likeable side.  It works so well.  So what if the corpses barely breathe at the end, the magic is in the acting, not playing 'possum!And to comment on the stop motion/slow motion- watching carefully- the romance scenes are filmed in real time.  There is almost no slow motion, and it only happens during the brutality near the end.  The stop motion worked well as bridges between scenes, but not so well when leading directly from dialogue.Hillary Swank won the Best Actress Oscar for this film, she deserved it on the merits of her acting alone... and it can't always be said that Oscar winners are so deserving!  It's interesting to compare this film with the one that captured the Best Actress Oscar in '96, Fargo.  Both are true stories, both depict senseless brutal murder committed to cover up earlier crimes.  While the filmgoing public can readily condemn the killers in Fargo, who kill to hide fraud, Boys Don't Cry (whose killers kill to hide a rape) causes a controversy.  Is that a tribute to the filmmaker for showing all sides of the story, or an indictment of our sorry world?

She moves out West and gets involved with a new group of friends who think that she's a guy but when her secret gets out her life becomes at risk. BOYS DON'T CRY isn't the greatest film ever made but it's certainly one of the most haunting and chilling. I think the first 70-minutes of the movie are extremely well-action and well-directed but I also don't think there's anything overly original or creative in them. The film really picks up in the second half when Brandon's secret gets revealed and we're shown all sorts of graphic violence including a rather brutal rape sequence. These scenes here are certainly the most powerful in the film because one really does get to see how stupid some people are and how violence can happen for no reason at all. I personally don't believe Brandon should have kept her real sex from people and especially when you're going to get romantically involved with someone. With that said, there's no question what happened after her secret was revealed is just downright disgusting and director Kimberly Price does a terrific job at showing how cold all of it was. The finally fifty-minutes of this film are incredibly hard to watch and there are times when you'll actually feel sick to your stomach. The film probably wouldn't have been so harsh had one not known that it was based on a true story and knowing this it just makes one even sicker. Swank picked up her first Oscar for her performance here and it is quite amazing. It's really shocking to see how believable she was in the role of Brandon and I thought she really excelled towards the end once her character becomes a victim. The fear that she showed during the attack scenes was quite remarkable. Chloe Sevigny is also very memorable in the role as the girl who falls for Brando. Both Peter Sarsgaard and Brendan Sexton III are very chilling in their roles.

The 1999 film Boys Don't Cry is the dramatization of Teena's story. Hilary Swank plays Teena/Brandon, the transgender person who prefers living as a man, despite the fact she was born biologically female. Her story takes place in and around Lincoln, Nebraska, a very rural area where locals don't take too kindly to something so foreign to them like transgender people. Teena/Brandon knows this so she hides the fact she is female while running around causing trouble with a group of alcoholic ruffians. But when she falls in love for Lana, one of the people she stays with outside of Lincoln, things get very complicated and the story darkens quite a bit in this brutally honest and disturbingly real film that is hauntingly sick from start to finish.You have to go into Boys Don't Cry prepared for a lot of drama, a lot of emotion, and a lot of brutality that will both shock and disgust you. This is a vulgar, disturbing, and obscene film that will haunt your dreams and make you look at the world in a whole new way. Of course, the vulgarity and obscenity I'm referring to has nothing to do with the protagonists sexuality. What is so shocking and so disturbing about this film is how our protagonist must live her life and the disgusting bigotry and hatred she must face. It's such a harrowing experience, one that we rarely see translated to film in such a brutally realistic way. Boys Don't Cry captures a dark and troubled part of real life that so many of us are sheltered from. It opens our eyes and our minds to what all is out there and it shows us just how different this world can be and the horrible ways in which people will do all they can to fight off change and difference that we all experience.Boys Don't Cry is not a film you will walk away from thinking, Boy, that was a great film, or, Gee, I really enjoyed that. No. It is a film you will walk away from shocked and appalled. It's not a film you simply look at as just a good film. It's a violent slap in the face from reality. It's a film that, rather than transport you from the real world, throws you into it's dark crevices and makes you experience the kind of horrors that really are out there. It's a sobering experience that will surely make you think, and will challenge you to open your eyes to the different kinds of people that do exist in this world. Boys Don't Cry is a very difficult film but, if you can handle it, you really have to see it. It's a cinematic experience like no other, and it will throw new and somewhat frightening ideas into your mind. This is quite the film.

This is the difference that distinguishes her from others, and develops a sexual identity crisis in her. Never does Teena as Brandon try to recognize her femininity; in fact, she tries to conceal it completely. Teena as Brandon is spunky, foul-mouthed, gutsy, amiable and sometimes reckless; Brandon as Teena (as the movie progresses we get to see shades of her) is delicate, vulnerable, pitiable and helpless; Brandon does not want Teena to weaken her, and she is emboldened when she is Brandon. Hilary Swank assumes the role of Brandon Teena in Boys Don't Cry, a poignant drama on the life of Brandon Teena, a young human being who was raped and murdered by her close male friends after being exposed as a woman posing as a man. For Hilary, this role is extensively challenging because she has to make Brandon believable; Brandon does not come from rich surroundings, neither does he possess exquisite talent or intelligence or have a terrific story to tell. He is a young trans-gender who has faced years of abuse at the hands of his uncle (not covered in the movie) and who only wants the world to accept him. Sadly, he cannot undergo a sex-change operation because of financial troubles, and therefore he has to remain careful regarding his identity. In the second scene, Brandon cannot take his eyes off a young girl and manages to kiss her by the end of their first date; the girls themselves fall for Brandon easily. But immediately, a group of flaring men chase and pelt Brandon with stones until he finds shelter in his cousin's trailer. His cousin fears for his own life and cannot put up with Brandon's constant negative attention-grabbing behavior, and therefore evicts him from his trailer. Brandon then befriends two ex-convicts and their friends, which includes his future girlfriend Lana, and becomes bedazzled by his newfound companions. However, these same relations possess a potential threat for him when he and Lana fall in love and skeletons begin to tumble out eventually. Swank is a wonder here &#x96; she conveys Brandon's confusion, happiness, acceptance, hurt, grief and fear with such subtlety we never find a moment of falseness from her performance. I saw this movie about a week ago and so my review may seem slightly unpolished but I can tell you one thing, that when Brandon begins to whimper as he is, being raped, his screams hint a presence of Teena underneath him. Hillary's acting is so powerful is that it became difficult for me to watch the entire scene without pausing once to cry watching her helplessness. Then there is Chloe Sevigny as Lana Tisdel, a hopeless drug addict whose life is as hollow as her karaoke performance in the bar. Lana's life changes after she meets Brandon who turns her from this confused and submissive wreck to an independent woman who stands by Brandon and is able to see her life more clearly. Chloe manages to give much more depth to her character and conveys her hopelessness, loss, love, confusion, and support through her beautiful eyes. Peter Sarsgaard plays John Lotter, a self-destructive man, whose only outlet for hiding his weakness is to do drugs, commit violence and lose impulse. His friend Tom Nissen, played by Brendan, is slightly more stable but in the same quagmire as his friend, cutting himself to calm his impulses. Sarsgaard makes Lotter intimidating and fearful, a highlight being when Lotter isn't able to accept his fault of encouraging Brandon to drag race and evade the police, and he brazenly tells the group, except Lana to get out of the car, leaving them stranded. Here, Nissen's reaction to Brandon's defense against Lotter is noteworthy as he tries to calm Brandon down to no avail.The technical aspects of the movie are also surprisingly unconventional; director Kimberley Pierce takes us extremely close to the characters' mental state, which is mostly spaced-out because of all the drugs. This works for most of the film, especially in case of Lana, and makes the confrontational scenes even more haunting, because that is when things begin losing their haziness. I was not very impressed with the slow-motion sequence towards the end of the movie and would've opted for a quicker, more shocking end for Brandon.Boys Don't Cry is a great film whose director (and writer) Kimberly is genuinely interested in its subject (unlike the recent failing of Ms. Phyllida Lloyd) and knows how to get emotional response from her characters and get the audience closer to the character's own perceptions. It may be putting-off for many because of the subject matter, the rape scene and the pace, but anyone who is ready to give the film a chance will be mesmerized by the performances, the story, the characters and the direction.My Rating 8.6 out of 10 "}{"Title":"Powerful And Disturbing If At Times A Bit Unfocused","Date":"27 August 2011","Score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Biography, Drama, Romance","Review":" There were more than a few times when I wondered what the message was. The subject matter was interesting enough. Teena Brandon (Brandon) was a transgendered female who identified as a male and lived as a male in Lincoln, Nebraska. After some difficulties with the law, Brandon finds himself hooked up with a questionable group of friends in a small town in the state. The friends include a couple of ex-cons, and several young women, one of whom - Lana - Brandon becomes involved with even though she doesn't know about Brandon's sexuality.This is based on a true story. I didn't really know the details of Brandon's life, and so had no idea what the movie was going to contain or what was going to happen. For a good part of its runtime, I was wondering what made the story so significant. It was interesting to see how Brandon approached the question of sexuality and how Brandon lived. It was obvious that Brandon was someone who came from a troubled background; obvious also that Brandon's sexual identity had resulted in rejection from Brandon's own family. Brandon had a troubled life, and in some ways the connection with Lana made sense. She also had a troubled and unhappy home life, and the two did seem able to support one another through their respective difficulties. Even though Lana didn't know about Brandon's sexuality, her acceptance of Brandon as a male must have been a source of some comfort and relief. Hilary Swank won an Oscar for her portrayal of Brandon, and Chloe Sevigny was nominated for her portrayal of Lana. I thought both were excellent in this. The movie eventually becomes quite dark and disturbing, moving from being an account of Brandon's life to the events that led up to Brandon's death. Unable to hide the secret forever, Brandon's identity is discovered by the thugs John and Tom (Peter Saarsgard and Brendan Sexton III). This becomes quite ugly, and for perhaps the first time in the movie Brandon (who had come across up to this point as a bit manipulative, lying about all manner of things and not just sexuality) becomes a real object of sympathy. John and Tom humiliate Brandon by forcibly removing Brandon's pants and forcing Lana to look to prove to her that Brandon has female parts. Brandon is then driven to an isolated area by John and Tom and brutally assaulted and raped. Eventually, out of fear that Brandon would report them for what they did, Brandon is murdered by John and Tom.Based on what I've read about Brandon/Teena and about the case since seeing this, I'd have to commend those responsible for sticking pretty close to the details of what happened. There doesn't seem to have been a lot of dramatic licence taken. I also appreciated that although in the end one has to be appalled by what happened to Brandon the movie didn't come across as a tribute to Brandon. Brandon was shown with both strengths and weaknesses. Brandon's life was hard - and some of the things that made it hard were the result of Brandon's own choices. Brandon's life wasn't soft-soaped in any way to create a hero. This was a life depicted with warts and all. Having said that, it should be mentioned that the real Lana threatened to take legal action over the use of her real name without permission and because of what she claimed was an inaccurate depiction of her life.For a while if you don't know the background of the true events that inspired it, you do wonder exactly where this is going, what point is trying to be made or what lesson is trying to be taught. Still, it's very interesting from beginning to end, and turns out to be both powerful and disturbing. All in all, it's an excellent piece of work.

How many? I couldn't tell you. Well, less than eleven, obviously, if not necessarily by much. I'd say it's in excess of seven. Anyway, I wasn't very old or mature at the time, and yet it gripped me. From start to finish. It hit me like a sledgehammer, and it has not left my memory since. This needed to be made. It is the true story of Brandon Teena, a transgendered youth. A controversial(and important) subject to be sure, hence its low budget and the need for it to be independently produced. How to make it work? Focus on the aspect everyone can relate to. Romance. Love. This is about being yourself, about acceptance, identity and understanding. We are introduced to angry 20-ish guys and girls who don't have many chances of a good future, and it angers and frustrates them. Every character in this is completely credible, psychologically accurate, well-developed and portrayed to perfection. Swank(who can pass for a boy), then new-comer Sevigny(whom we fall in love with along with our lead... and she can sing, too!), Sarsgaard(that man has serious guts to go along with his acting chops), I could go on. Entirely convincing every step of the way. This has an immense energy to it, emulating the live fast philosophy that the people we follow engage in. It is in part on account of the very loose and dynamic camera-work that also creates atmosphere. This barely slows down. Then there are the dream-like sequences hinting towards a freer existence that the real person wanted to achieve. There is impeccable tension in this, as well. The music is great, all well-chosen songs, many of them country, the rest being rock. There is a lot of disturbing content and strong language, a bit of full female nudity and sexuality, a little bloody and unpleasant violence and disgusting stuff and a brutal rape scene in this, none of it gratuitous. The DVD comes with an informational and interesting commentary track by the director/co-writer, Kimberley Peirce(note that she swears in it), a four-minute featurette(largely promotional, and it contains spoilers), a trailer, a teaser and three TV-spots. I recommend this to everyone who can handle it. 8/10 "},{"Title":"Shocking, Brutal, Powerful","Date":"10 July 2010","Score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Biography, Drama, Romance","Review":" I've been sitting here for about twenty minutes deciding how to start this review, and I can't think of one. Maybe it's just best to describe what the film is like. Boys Don't Cry is an absolutely riveting film. It held my absolute attention from frame one, and as the end credits rolled, I sat in my chair completely stunned.A young man saunters into a bar and starts chatting up a girl sitting two seats away from him. He tells her his name is Brandon, and she appears to like him. After a burly man starts getting fresh with her, he steps in, and a brawl ensues. Brandon makes quick friends with the girl, named Candace (Alica Goranson), and her friends. But this charming, sensitive young man is hiding a secret he's biologically female.This film is based on the true story of Brandon Teena, a trans man who was brutally raped and later murdered by John Lotter and Tom Nissen, two men he considered his friends. As told by co-writer/director Kimberly Peirce, it is a fiercely compelling and devastating story.Much of the reason why this film works so well is because the performances are superb. Hilary Swank won an Oscar for her portrayal of Brandon. Although the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences has made some serious blunders in who they give their awards, this is not one of them. Swank is nothing short of incredible. I've seen The Year of Living Dangerously, where Linda Hunt portrayed a male character (and won an Oscar for it). Hunt was terrific, but prior knowledge inhibited me from completely buying into the character. Somehow Swank manages to overcome this, and it took about ten minutes for me to stop seeing Swank playing a guy and just see Brandon Teena. But the physical transformation isn't the only reason why she's so good. Swank embodies the character completely to a degree that I've never seen before. Brandon is not a rocket scientist, and unquestionably naiive. He knows what he wants, but he fails to really think about the possible consequences of trying to pass himself off as a man. In fact, his penchant for trouble and his naivetÃ© actually present the possibility of a personality disorder. Nevertheless, Brandon is a tender and romantic soul whose sensitivity makes the girls swoon over him. This is probably one of the most complex characters ever to grace the screen, and Swank creates a person who is startlingly real. This is not just a breakthrough performance; this is a performance of a lifetime.Swank walks away with the film, but the other actors are also great. Chloe Sevigny is great as Lana, the girl who becomes romantically involved with Brandon. The development of this subplot is rather rushed, but the performances by Swank and Sevigny make it work nonetheless. Lana is a wounded soul who desperately wants to escape her life of boredom and reprehensible men, and Brandon is her escape. It's a low-key performance, but it works very well. Peter Saarsgard is an actor who plays facets of himself, but Peter Saarsgard as a psychopath works as John Lotter. He seems like an okay guy, but there is always the potential for violence whenever he's around. Unfortunately, Brandon never realizes this, or perhaps he is so desperate for his transformation to work that he ignores it. Alicia Goranson is very good as Candace, who's even more naiive and simple-minded than Brandon, and Jeanetta Cunningham is excellent as Lana's alcoholic mother.The film is expertly told by Kimberly Peirce. It's not flawless (as I said, the Brandon/Lana romance is a little rushed, there's a dream shot that is ill-placed, and one of Brandon's crimes is confusing), but it is always compelling. She has a keen eye for establishing the setting. This is small town Nebraska, where there is nothing to do but get drunk every night and go to work to pick up a paycheck so you can drink some more. This enhances the story by creating a place where this all can happen. Boredom and a lack of education have given birth to a place where something this horrifying can occur.This is not an easy film to watch. But for those who venture into this film will find a film that is absolutely unforgettable.

It's definitely an accomplished bit of film-making, and it features an astonishing performance by Hilary Swank, but I don't know that it's a movie I'd ever want to watch again.It tells the story of Brandon Teena, a young girl who wanted to be a boy. As she explains it in the movie, she suffered from a birth defect whereby she was accidentally born with female body parts. She lives in rural Nebraska, where homosexuality isn't ever tolerated, let alone a lifestyle as complicated as the one she lives. She's of course viewed as either a monster or an object of ridicule, until the intolerance surrounding her reaches a devastating and tragic conclusion.Boys Don't Cry is the kind of movie that will likely only be seen by those who already sympathize with Brandon Teena, and will never be seen by those the movie is trying to instruct.Grade A "},{"Title":"An Unusual Tale of Gender Identity","Date":"17 June 2010","Score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Biography, Drama, Romance","Review":" Teena Brandon (Hilary Swank) identifies as a boy, so she calls herself Brandon Teena and dresses as a boy.

The general appearance would suggest that Teena is a lesbian a woman who likes women. But, that's not really accurate. She's really a man in a woman's body, who happens to like women. As strange as that may sound, it happens.Hilary Swank was, of course, excellent as Brandon Teena. But I also think credit should be given to ChloÃ« Sevigny as Lana Tisdel.

This is hardly no mean achievement for a low budget independent film which went on to become a tremendously huge commercial as well as critical success.Viewers and critics can do justice to this film by ascertaining what it meant to them and how continues to change their perception of alternative sexual preference.It has been repeatedly stated in media that Boys Don't Cry is a film about hate crime but not enough information is given to enable viewers to have an idea of what exactly causes such a gruesome crime to happen.This is something which can be considered as a weak spot in the overall narrative trajectory.It is true that this film is an absorbing biopic about a person who faces issues related to sexual identity crisis but the film loses its charm when it starts to focus more on its sundry characters. It would be blasphemous to compare Boys Don't Cry with In Cold Blood as Richard Brooks' film laid ample stress on criminals' psychological as well as emotional framework.This is not exactly the case with Boys Don't Cry as it appears mostly as a film depicting dreary existence of low lives in small,sleepy,obscure American towns.Boys Don't Cry would always be remembered as a truly phenomenal film which has been able to garner wider acclaim thanks to peerless collaboration between filmmaker Kimberly Peirce and leading lady Hillary Swank.

When Teena wants to live her life 'his' way, she has to face all the opposition and finally ends dead. In the movie, the social beliefs are so strict that though Teena enjoys all the fame and love she gets from the act, she can't help feeling a little guilty at times. She blames it to be a 'Sexual Identity Crisis' and lies that she has some sexual deformity even though she's physically a perfectly normal girl. Teena was really popular as long as she was able to hide her real self but the moment her 'friends' know that she is pretending to be a boy, they all turn against her. They all question her and John and Tom even brutally rape her. Only Lana loves her just as a person, not caring if she's 'half monkey or half ape' and Teena loves her back. So much so that she tries to continue to fake a male identity and the two plan to elope from Lana's family. It shows that obsession can drive one to do unimaginable things and cross all limits. It is also about the search for one's true identity. All the characters in this film are lost and confused thus leading depressed lives, but Brandon was the only one who realized it of herself and tried to fight for happiness. They are enraged upon the revelation of Brandon's true identity. It left them to confront their own flimsy identities. It is interesting to see that even such 'dark' people are able to out rightly declare Teena as a social reject and shoot her dead. At the end of it all, in spite of her deceptive and criminal deeds, we are forced to empathize with Teena in her struggle with this cruel world disapproving of trans-gendered people. Such examples force us to ponder if it is really apt for 'Mother Nature' to imprison us in these bodies of particular 'sexes' while bestowing upon us this wonderful gift called life!

It doesn't shy away from its subject matter, it confronts it head on.The story concerns a young transsexual (Hilary Swank) who strikes up a relationship with a young woman (ChloÃ« Sevigny) who isn't aware of his/her condition. Brushes with the law and homophobic would-be friends soon threaten to bring the relationship to a tragic end.The acting in the film is not that great, with two exceptions. Swank's performance was justly rewarded by an Oscar while Sevigny earned an Oscar nomination. This was Swank's breakthrough as she shone in a very challenging role. Her chemistry with Sevigny is evident in the scenes they share, including some of an intimate nature.The direction by Kimberly Pierce is well done throughout and was a surprise since the name was completely unfamiliar to me. The soundtrack, on the other hand, is hit and miss with a few excellent choices alongside some regrettable ones.One possible drawback for this film is that it's based on a true story so if, like me, you're already familiar with the story then you know how it ends. Nevertheless, it should keep you interested, if only to behold the fine performances from Swank and Sevigny.

I also know that this is a movie and as such there will always be slight exaggeration but even so i could only shake my head disbelievingly. What also struck me was Teena Brandon/Brandon Teena's desperation to be considered as a man. She just couldn't live her life as a woman and therefore did everything she could to be and stay male.Finally I have to say that this movie is not made for everybody.

Hilary Swank well-deserved her Best Actress Oscar for beautifully portraying the real-life person Brandon Teena, a gender-confused lesbian who wandered around down South disguised as a boy to score hot girls. The tragic true story ended with Brandon Teena being brutally raped and murdered by two mouth-breathing violent hicks (played in the film by Welcome to the Dollhouse's Brendan Sexton III and the ever-so-brilliant Peter Sarsgaard) who were her buddies when they thought she was a boy. Chloe Sevigny (in a performance I actually really like her in) plays Lana, Peter Sarsgaard's sister who befriends and eventually falls in love with Brandon. Kimberly Pierce does a decent job directing her debut but she does a fantastic job with the film's screenplay. Peter Sarsgaard is perfectly diabolical in a performance that should have earned him an Oscar nomination for 'Best Supporting Actor', while Chloe Sevigny is great in her performance that actually won her a nomination for 'Best Supporting Actress'. However, the movie belongs to Hilary Swank who in it manages to distinguish herself as an actress in the ranks of Meryl Streep and Glenn Close. Swank is breathtaking simply put and engages you in her role for every second she is on screen. 'Boys Don't Cry' is indescribably disturbing, especially during it's needed but gut-wrenching rape scene, but if you can handle it I think you will find it to be a very good film.

The true story of Teena Brandon, Boys Don't Cry will make you sick, sad, and intrigued at the same time. Having grown up in a small rural town full of tunnel-visioned people, I can relate with the movie from the stand point of being different and sticking out like a sore thumb. Even tho it's an independent film, the story has been Hollywood-ized, but the real story it is based upon has been told without apology or disclaimer. Because it is an independent film, it doesn't have the big-budget look, and it really doesn't need it. The heart of the story gets told honestly, and with a story like this, it wouldn't have been right any other way. Hillary Swank deserved her Oscar for this, and you will believe her portrayal of a woman trying her darnedest to be a guy. Many times, I forgot that she was a woman, but not in a campy, impersonator-type way. She looks like a young, baby-faced boy/man, and has the mannerisms, look, and lingo down. This is a tragic tale and Teena Brandon was definitely a messed-up individual, however, her gender-identity really takes a back seat to her up-bringing, her choice of friends, her habitual lying, and troubles with the law. Because of the combination, she is ignored by her family and the legal-system; the two entities anyone should be been able to count on. In the end, these are the things that kill her - the two morons who pull the trigger are just the vehicle. Still, you will end up hating the killers and see their backwards, red-necked male-macho baloney for what it is way before the movie heats up. This is more than just a trans-gender movie, it is a complex tale that includes a cast of characters you have probably known once or twice in your life. And that, hopefully, will make you think about and compel you to see this movie more than once. It's message deserves that you do.

Without upper body strength or a pistol it's not as easy as she thought.

He is a transsexual (or suffering from a sexual identity crisis), and desperately awaits the operation that will change his life for the better. He continually finds himself flirting with girls in bars under his preferred name of Brandon Teena, but always has to remind himself that he cannot go further with them. One of these girls, however, unaware that Brandon is technically female, introduces him to her circle of friends (including Peter Sarsgaard), and Brandon begins to feel a sense of normalcy creep into his troubled life. But he is always fearful of his new companions discovering his secret, especially when he begins to develop a more than physical attraction towards Lana (Chloe Sevigny).With the fact that 'Boys Don't Cry' is based on a true story comes a dilemma. What if you already knew what was going to happen? But even if one knows how this story will turn out, it would be hard not to be moved by the film's climax. In fact, knowledge of Brandon/Teena's fate may actually amplify the ending's emotional impact, as it makes the optimistic moments of 'Cry' all that more tragic. Hilary Swank gives a harrowing performance that plays up her androgynous appearance. She really does convince as a boy.~ 8/10 ~ "},{"Title":"one of the best movies i have ever seen, a moving and life-changing experience....for me at least","Date":"19 April 2005","Score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Biography, Drama, Romance","Review":" i read the book, by Aphrodite Jones, and it was one of the best books i have ever read. so immediately i was thrilled to hear they had made a movie out of it. starring Hilary swank, one of the best actresses i have seen, by her performance in million dollar baby, and Chloe Sevegny, from Melinda & Melinda. i watched it, and i have to say....wow.boys don't cry is the true story of Teena Brandon, a 23 year old girl who dreams of being a boy. Teena dresses as a boy, cuts her hair and stuffs socks in her underpants, and can pass as a boy. she fools a group of friends living in new falls, Nebraska, and she dates, and has sex with Lana Tisdel. Lana is the obsession of John. John, her ex boyfriend and his friend tom are friends of Teena. Teena goes to jail for forgery, and while she is in jail, the sh*t hits the fan. they find tampons and a dildo in her bag, and when she comes home with Lana, she realizes what they have done. Lana takes her into her bedroom saying she'll check whats in Teena's pants, but she comes out saying Teena's a boy, not checking. john takes her into the bathroom later with tom and pulls down her pants to expose her for what she really is a girl. he tells Lana to look, she struggles, but when she sees, she doesn't care that Teena's a girl. she loves her. john and tom let Teena go, but when she leaves, they are outside, and they take her to an alley. and rape her.The rape scene made me cry. it's hard to make me cry in a movie, but i cried. during the rape scene, it was a cross-over, she was telling it to a police officer. it was just....o my god. she was saying it through tears, and it was the best acting i've ever scene. the raping was so intense, they both did it, against the car and in the car, and it just made me appreciate everything i had in that one moment. and after the raping, they are being nice to her again. it was odd, they asked her not to tell anyone, so she immediately tells Lana. after a few days, john comes hunting for Teena.Teena is staying at Candice's house and they go there. after promising Lana they could go to Teena's house in Lincoln and start a new life. but their dream was cut short when john and tom drove to Candice's house and found Teena. she was shot in the neck, and Candice was shot in the head. they spared Lana.one of the best movies i have ever seen, Boys Don't Cry is an extremely moving piece of cinema that should be more acknowledged.

If I didn't know better I might have been fooled too.  They did a good job on that one.  Anyway, the victim did not deserve to be brutalized and killed, but she was far from the good guy.Unwarranted cruelty to another human being is never, ever acceptable, no matter what demographics that person belongs to, or what (comparatively) petty mischief they've done.  So that is the movie's overall message if I look at it optimistically.  We all must agree on that.Now finally ask yourself, if Teena Brandon was a hetero, non-gender-confused woman who had been brutalized and murdered, does the likelihood of a movie being made about her diminish? Unfortunately, I think so.In other words, it is a valid movie, but the focus is too much on the victim's lifestyle, and not enough on the reality, that rape and murder are WRONG and inexcusable, no matter the circumstances.Watch, learn, and decide.

There's not much for young men to do but drive around in stolen cars, get drunk and stoned, and raise merry hell; not such a bad life, in fact, compared to that of their womenfolk, who work in dead-end jobs and try to look out for their kids.  This outstanding film tells the horrific true story of Teena Brandon, a girl who found her identity through transgressing into the role of a boy.  But its real strength comes from the way it uses the particulars of its story both to capture some fundamental truths about the human condition, and also to perfectly evoke a sense of place.  The white trash communities are depicted, even at their worst, with a complex humanity that defies this simple label; their world both cruel and warm, ghastly yet attractive.  Accepted in it as a male, Teena experiences both a thrill and a sense of belonging.  The conveyance of these subtle, confused emotions is aided by the technical excellence of this movie the performances are universally strong (especially Peter Sarsgaard as the Teena's disturbed nemesis), the scene composition unshowy but haunting, the country rock soundtrack exactly on the ball but never allowed to intrude. Crucially, the film never strays into purience or preaching.  We're left with a simple tale of a mixed-up kid out of his/her depth; but every detail is made to count.Smalltown America is a favourite subject for filmmakers, but this is one the best portraits yet, and certainly the most disturbing.  Think American Graffiti without the sentiment, or Fargo without the irony.  Compelling, bleak, and human, this is better than either.

For most of the movie, also, she actually looked like a boy. She goes to a rural Nebraska town to stay for a while, since she's in trouble with the law. There she meets Lana (ChloÃ« Sevigny), whose philosophy on life includes, `You don't have to be sober to weigh spinach,' and falls in love. She, still as Brandon, falls into the `gang' that includes Lana, John (Peter Sarsgaard), and Tom (Brendan Sexton III). Then, when people start finding out that Brandon Teena may not be Brandon Teena, things get bad.Strong language, brutal rape, and nudity is included in Boys Don't Cry. It certainly is an exciting piece of art if you're ready to be shocked. I felt a connection to Brandon. I didn't feel like I was Brandon, but I could understand what she was going through. She didn't really want to get involved with all of the drunkenness and dangerous activities everyone else was doing, but she had to do it anyway. She had the courage to be what she wanted to be, an important message that may be used in too many movies now, but especially holds strong in this one.Hilary Swank puts in an exceptional performance, showing true emotion, and she makes this little indie pic known and brought it to Oscar status. Sevigny also was nominated for best Supporting Actress, but didn't win, for some unknown reason. She was truly great, also. I don't want to list everyone in the movie and how good they were, so I'll just say that everyone was great.If I had to complain about this movie, I have three. First, I thought, a lot of times, there wasn't much character development and that the characters were muddled, since I didn't know who some of them were at times, such as Kate. Secondly, for the first half of the film or so, the movie didn't explore Brandon's cross-dressing, which is the main point of the film. Third, the make-up on Brandon's face was obvious at time, but if you get engrossed in the movie like I was, you won't notice anything wrong.Boys Don't Cry is an emotional tour de force that you won't forget for a long time.My rating 9/10Rated R for violence including an intense brutal rape scene, sexuality, language and drug use.

I'm not really sure that either performance is Oscarworthy, as many people have said, but they both fall into their characters and make you believe in what they're doing. The other performances were also very good. The other positive was how the director caught the feel of the helplessness of Falls City (the town where this takes place). The dark, moody lighting and the decay that seemed to surround their lives was the perfect backdrop for the film.However, the film does have problems. Brandon Teena's story is not fully explained. Unless you are aware of her story, you don't know how she wound up becoming sexually confused, and a little more explanation of this would have been helpful. The other problem I had was with the pacing. As a lot of people on the comments board have noted, this movie is very slow. Some movies are slow in that they build up to something, but the pacing in this movie is very bad. The writer probably intended to give you an idea of what a nothing existence there is in Falls City, but instead it makes you wonder when the payoff is coming.But it is a good movie. It makes you think about homosexuality in Middle America, which is definitely something worth thinking about and not ignoring. I do get the feeling that this movie was made for people who are A)very knowledgeable about the Brandon Teena story and B) very sympathetic to her and to homosexual issues in general. However, the film isn't exclusionary or limited in that way. It did need to be a little more fleshed out, though, to truly make it a four-star movie, which this film wasn't. 7/10.

Boys don't cry is a homage to his unfortunate life which, according to the film, was endured (exemplary) with passion and joy. Regrettably, the film never reaches these high standards. As a matter of fact, it is not far from being a mere TV production whose only value lies in documenting Brandon's life. Arguably, this might be the only reason why it has made it to the big screen.

The film paints a picture of a lovely, sweet sensitive young person that the viewer cannot help but care about. When bad things happen to this character you feel it in your heart, as well you should. There are very few things that help people understand these gender issues (Ma Vie En Rose is a great example) and anything that portrays the problems so well should be viewed by everyone, so there can be more understanding.Hilary Swank was AMAZING and so was Chloe. Kimberly Peirce is a terrific director with a (true) story to tell, and she crafts it wonderfully. It seems that some people don;t understand that the story is true...I believe that anyone who thinks this is just a gay story doesn't realize that Brandon (Teena) was not a lesbian. She was a boy, in her mind and in her soul. Sometimes Mother Nature makes mistakes. And sometimes people can't see past their own ignorance to let people live the way they need to. Transgendered people need more open dialogue and more role models, in the same way that more gay issues have become common topics. Let's hope more films like this come along, but that the horror and evil is no longer based on real life.

It had roots in reality, the reality of the Nebraska farmland and I suppose that that is ultimately where the film went wrong, it got stuck in the Nebraska mud.There are so many things about the movie that actually went right, lighting, pacing, acting, the story moved although ultimately it is in the story that the film starts to fall for me. In the story and in the rather dismal lives that they lead. I honestly didn't like anyone that I saw in the movie. What is worse I didn't see anyone for whom I had revulsion/ attraction. That can happen, Drugstore Cowboy is a story about drug addicted pharmacy robbing losers who are going nowhere fast, but they are compelling losers. The guys in this movie are so pathetic, they just get drunk and wake up the next morning to start the whole process over again. I wouldn't want to drink in their bars and I didn't really want to share their lives, but there was this compelling story about a transsexual, Brandon Teena, that I thought would make this movie rewarding. To watch him become a man. Wrong it was just another loser out drinking. A sensitive loser, yes, but a loser none the less. I just could not find anything to keep me watching after an hour. I just didn't care, and that is sad for I really do understand the underlying issues. I want people to understand those issues. There really is a great movie in that story. This just isn't it.

Both the content of the movie and the plot leave you begging for the end.  The movie is extremely slow and this is mainly because the plot is so lacking. We get to know Brandon, but the first hour of the movie is merely a party. Party after party, leads the audience to get bored with the film, because it doesn't seem to be going anywhere.  In fact, it takes at least twenty five minutes of the film for Brandon to even meet Lana.  Aside from the grudging pace of the film, the content is utterly disturbing and depressing.  We watch some of the most low class people.  The only people that seem to shine are Brandon and Lana, and this is expressed well in the scenes where they dream about going to Memphis.  Towards the end of the film, the plot picks up and so does the speed.  We hope that Brandon and Lana can make it and that they dont hurt Brandon.  The ending adds a major shock to this hope.  I suppose that the director was aiming at creating a parrallel between Brandon as a guy in the beginning and as an uncovered woman in the end. At first we see that these people really like him as a good friend.   The acting in this film is really great, and Swank is brilliant.Nevertheless, the grudging pace and excessive depressing scenes boggled down the great performances.

The rape scenes, are not for the faint of heart at all, but are very graphic and difficult to watch, w/o turning away. The murder scene, though quick said so much.

It explores issues of gender identity, relationships, and the limits of tolerance in small-town America.  It doesn't paint a pretty picture, which is even more painful considering that the story told is based on real events.  Brandon Teena is, as has been oft-repeated by now, an extremely compelling character.  He/she believes he/she is a man trapped in a woman's body.  He is attracted to women, but does not identify as a lesbian, and is determined to live as a man which is the only time that he feels right. During the course of the film, he pursues relationships with several women, and in these relationships, he is gentle and compassionate, and reveals his very big heart.  Of course, as Brandon is staying in a small town and not maintaining a particularly low profile, the secret is eventually discovered, and his friends turn out to be capable of a great deal of violence, and Brandon is raped (an act done to her as a woman to try to enforce her gender.)  The rape and her reaction to it are probably the most compelling, interesting, and important parts of the film.Also important is the fact that while Brandon is ultimately doomed, some of the friends that he had made were able to transcend their discomfort over his gender identity crisis, and show him love and compassion even after the secret was out.Finally, Hilary Swank fully deserved the Academy Award that she won for portraying Brandon.  She is fully believable in a role that must have been incredibly difficult and painful to play.

Boys Don't Cry is about the horrors that people do to each other, as well as the struggle to figure out who we are in a world full of people who all have their own opinions about us. I love two things about it the title, which is perfect, and Hilary Swank's Oscar-winning performance as Teena/Brandon. She is a drifter who, believing that she was supposed to be male, dreams of having sex-change surgery. As she waits, she dresses as a boy, dates women, gets into repeated trouble with the law, and moves in for a time with a small-town family that's almost as aimless as she is. She falls in love with a girl named Lana, which leads to trouble later on once people figure out who she really is. Swank's performance is deep and complex; she clearly shows the conflict between Teena/Brandon's desire to be a man and her reality of being a woman. Although I loved Annette Bening in American Beauty, I definitely think Swank deserved her Oscar. I think this film disturbed me even more because I knew it was largely based on a true story. It's an odd combination of sickening tragedy, beautiful emotion, and haunting ideas and images. The credits song, The Bluest Eyes in Texas, still gives me chills when I think about it.

Its a world of young working people, not long out of high school. Thrilled with being freed from parental constraints they seek thrills at after-bar-parties.  There is drinking, hanging out in taverns, the occasional beef leading to a fight, karaoke singing, dangerous jousts and high speed chases in cars.The familiar scenario becomes less so with the appearance of a boyish-looking girl- Teena Brandon- who looks like an extremely un-macho high school male.Hilary Swank, the actress who portrays Teena, is in almost every scene of this perfectly plotted if suspiciously predictable story.Brandon lives in Lincoln, Nebraska, but she is having a lot of difficulty there.  Her attempts at bedding a member of her same sex are getting her into serious trouble. A male friend who lives in a trailer warns that her behavior will lead to violence against her after Teena is chased to his place by gay-bashers.Teena hits on a solution.  She decides to try her luck with other girls in another city Falls City, Nebraska. Right away, the young set she encounters there take a shine to her.  Teena  fools this new crowd into believing she is a guy.  At least she fools them for awhile. Our 21 year old leading character has reversed her name to become Brandon Teena.She takes up with a group of twenty somethings and two older males who gather around the broken household of a divorced woman and her daughter Lana.  Teena is smitten with Lana.  And gradually, Lana gets interested in Teena.This is a love story, a long love story.  The gender problem is childs play for Teena to handle at first.  But gradually, the family begins to have doubts about Brandon Teena. The story is delicately told. It is a surprise to see the storys sexual details revealed so explicitly. Though the explicitness lengthens the movie, I think director Kimberley Peirce and her co-screenwriter Andy Bienen were right to risk it.The third act is extremely long.  The nature of Teena's romance with Lana is dawning.  There will be consequences.   The mostly true story has a powerful ending. The scenario is a little too perfect, however.  It is obvious the real story has been cooked slightly to strike the right moral Homophobes are bad.  I suspect Brandon's real experience in 1993 Falls City was quite a bit more complex and less likely to lead the audience to these right conclusions.The central characters are extremely well rendered. The story is superb even if it is a touch too long. Hilary Swank's young man trapped in a girl's body is extraordinary. Her performance reminds me very much of the young and innocent Judy Garland of the late 30s and early 40s.  The actress doesn't look that male. Her innocence is thus key to putting over this extremely complex character.  Miss Swank does it smashingly.  I will be very disappointed if she does not become as big a star as Garland became.

I had heard all the (deserved) praise for Hilary Swank's and Chloe Sevigny's performances.  What I was not prepared for was the calibre of performance turned in by the other members of the cast.This was a difficult script to bring to life.  Although its centerpiece is a love story, these two lovers are surrounded by a world of paradox attraction/repulsion to Brandon Teena by everone else he comes to meet which is their direct response to Brandon's manipulation of them.Alicia Gorenson quickly made me forget Becky, 'the First.'  I was thrilled to see that she has grown into a delicately subtle character actor.  Her re-embrace of Brandon following her betrayal of him was a heartbreaking depiction of redemption.   I was prepared for Brandon's fate, but not for hers.Being from the South, I confess I know people like the characters represented in this film; and I can say there was deep compassion in the dimensional performances turned in by Brendan Sexton III, Matt McGrath and Jeanetta Arnette (who was really playing my cousin Callie - perfectly).Then there was Peter Sarsgaard.  Here was the presentation of the strongest and most dangerous paradox in the film.  The first time he appeared there was good-ole-boy admiration in his eyes for the little dude taking on the oversized bully.  Then a few moments later, a look of enchantment at his sight of Brandon's tiny hands.  Sarsgaard orbited Swank like an unstable moon around a planet, pushed and pulled by forces over which it can have no control.  There was more than a hint in this preformance that John Lotter might have loved (insofar as he could) Teena Brandon - had he met her.  The revelation of Brandon's physical gender becomes Brandon's betrayal of him. His despair at this knowledge is devastating.  He can only react like an uncomprehending beast to a hunter's wound.There is a quality I have come to regard as the highest an actor can possess.  It is, plain and simply, courage.  Paradoxically, it can only exist in an atmosphere of total protection.  Kimberly Peirce certainly provided that world for her actors.  She has given us a film with meat on its bones and a great loving heart, and one that perhaps could change us for the better if we let it.I apologize if I seem to have neglected Chloe Sevigny and Hilary Swank in my comments here.  It is just that anything I could say would be redundant.  I can only hale the two of them at the start of their illustrious careers (after God-only-knows how many overnights they've had to endure).

The characterizations were true to life and captured fairly well a certain small subculture of rural slums that tolerates episodic trouble with the law, impulsive disorders, polysubstance abuse, and a few antisocial personalities among a semi-permanent group of people who see themselves as (and function like) family.The movie is short on answers as to why anything happens.  It's as if Brandon was 'just born that way.'  Perhaps so, but among transvestites & gender change candidates I've had in therapy, they've often endured -- while a child -- either a painful episode or atmosphere from which they emerge with a hope that becomes a belief that a change in gender will finally make the unhappiness and misery inside go away -- somewhat as a butterfly finally emerges from a cocoon.  I've heard that Teena's mother has recently criticized the movie for not showing that Teena was sexually abused as a child.  It certainly wouldn't be surprising to me if Teena did have that in her history.I heard some people blaming Lana's Mom for not exercising more judgment and structure for her extended family.  But, in my experience, people like Lana's mom themselves usually grew up in a family that is dysfunctionally similar (often worse in some respects) to the one in which she raised Lana.

Boys Don't Cry is a very powerful movie that wisely chooses to record the events leading up to the inevitable conclusion, rather than preach to the viewer. A relatively simple story which could have been done very badly in the wrong hands, the film succeeds due to its strong characterisations, particularly those of Brandon, Lana and John.I have little to add to the other comments of praise, except to say I'm surprised by those who refer to Brandon as 'she'. At no time did Brandon seem anything other than male, even when it was clear that in one sense this was not completely true.

Brandon is not portrayed as someone you really feel sorry for at the beginning of the film.

But by the end of the film, you are totally drawn in and see Brandon as a real human being.  He's not perfect.  He has problems. But then again, don't we all?  That's the great thing about this film it's so realistic that about halfway through it, you forget that you're suppose to be enjoying a movie.  You realize that this story really happened.  A young girl living as a boy was really  raped and ultimately killed. You're left wondering how in the hell such an atrocity could occur.  You're left feeling ashamed that people exist in the world that could inflict such horrors upon another human being.

There is no other way to describe her performance in this movie.  That performance is, in my opinion, one of the ten best female performances of all time.

The androgynous Hilary Swank puts forth one of the most believable portrayals of a female impersonating a male. Any wonder why she has already won several Best Actress awards???  I commend both Hilary Swank and Chloe Sevigny for their courage, boldness, and discipline in playing the two female lovers.  I especially commend the director of this movie, Kimberly Peirce, for doing a really fine job.  The subject matter of this movie might be considered controversial and some people may be offended by it.  But Kimberly Peirce handled it beautifully.  She made a marvelous movie, considering that it is a little independent movie.  This movie might be the last movie that I will see this year (since the year is ending), and I'm really glad that I went to see this movie.

But even after that, there are further opportunities to draw us in even further, but the writer/director never capitalizes.

This film adequately addresses the prejudices of a small town (&#145;they hang fags in Falls City') but doesn't have the savvy to lead us toward a better understanding of the dually sexual Brandon / Teena or Teena / Brandon.  Instead we see a long-winded love story between the two main characters, Brandon and Lana (played courageous by Hilary Swank and Chloe Sevigny) that borders on perversion as well as a pathologic attraction between Brandon and an extended &#145;white trash' family that can accept promiscuity, drugs, but not transsexuality.   John is a borderline psychotic (if you argue with him when driving, he throws you out of the car) who has taken the role of the dad; buddy Tom, who did time in prison with John, thinks he is the only one who can control him;  and  &#145;Mom' may or may not have been John's older lover but now has been reduced to a walking drunk. Daughter Lana used to write juvenile letters to John while he was in prison but now has fallen for Brandon thinking he is a man and her acceptance of Brandon appears to be unconditional until the last when there is a strange and abrupt rejection.  Beyond the intrigue of wondering if Brandon will get caught, beyond the gasps of seeing the &#145;Butch' Brandon playing his character to a tee, and even beyond the seemingly natural act of love making between a woman and a man (who is really a woman), we are left with wondering who Brandon really was (he appears to have a mother nearby and is contemplating a sex operation even as he gingerly sidesteps all his arrest warrants). Boys Don't Cry accurately depicts mainstream America's abhorrence to sexual deviance but fails to win us sympathy for a tragic figure whose depiction is less toward understanding and more toward irresponsibility and sexual gratification.

After slogging the entire way through the ugly, depressing, predictable ending; and wondering what, beyond its undoubted brilliance in acting and cinematography, was the point, I discovered this fact only by reading on the screen, just before the credits rolled, that the perps were serving life sentences. Oh. That changes everything. Or does it? My hypothesis was confirmed, incidentally, that (with just a few exceptions such as the refreshingly un-PC _About_a_Boy_) the unlikeliest recent book or movie to feature a real boy character is one with the word boy in the title. Have you noticed?Being transgendered must be a very difficult card to be dealt in life, much more painful than being merely gay. Brandon easily won my sympathy on those grounds, but it was strained by the company he chose to keep. The moral of this story is very clear Any young person with his condition and lack of career ties, with or without his stated ambition to live in Memphis or some-such metropolis, should head there immediately-- by sticking out a thumb on the highway if necessary-- rather than hanging around small towns in the American heartland. There is a reason why gay people are such a presence in New York and San Francisco, and why they gravitate to urbane cultural occupations while we will inevitably encounter individuals who don't like us very much, at least they are civilized enough not to stoop to actual mayhem and murder. And there's a reason why civilized derives from the Latin for city. We have appreciated this for decades if not centuries. Many of us have also read _Lord_of_the_Flies. In this sense, the adjective disturbing for this film and its denouement is not only a clichÃ© but a curiously naive one. Would someone who finds the word insightful please elaborate as to which of their assumptions it has disturbed?There is some cold comfort, I suppose, in pondering that social developments may soon, for awhile, make Teena's affliction obsolete. Other than semen, whose necessity biological research has not yet managed to eliminate, there is less and less said for maleness. One reads, for example, of a revival of beekeeping as a hobby. Is it surprising that many of the revivalists are women who readily explain how they admire the social structure of the hive? From the queen on down, most of the work is done by females. The drones are luxuries, grown in great numbers during prosperous times, but idle, powerless (literally with no sting), and summarily banished and left to starve or freeze as soon as the weather changes. In the post-industrial West, too, women's liberation means the ability to go anywhere and do anything, reducing masculinity to ornamental pastimes (often via tough and noisy motor vehicles) which our feckless Johns, Toms, and Brandons pursue with ever-more-desperate swagger. They may live in a midwestern backwater (which Mark Twain, I think, said would be the best place to be when the world is ending, because everything happens ten years later), but even they are by now children of their time. In one regard, however, Brandon's instincts were old-fashioned when appealing to the opposite sex, he was all courtesy and chivalry-- and, despite having from all appearances yet to reach puberty, this approach was successful. Maybe there's hope yet. "},{"Title":"How depressing","Date":"23 December 2005","Score":"2 out of 4 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Biography, Drama, Romance","Review":" My gosh!

One feels the fear that fuels the angry distrust of anything that goes beyond the narrowly proscribed social norms of rural, small-town America.  One experiences the otherwise verdant and beautiful landscape of rural Nebraska as depressing and god-forsaken.  From the eyes of the main protagonist, Brandon Teena, the social atmosphere in which she lives and breathes and attempts to find a modicum of social acceptance is anything but nurturing  it is a terrifying landscape of cultural land mines, where labels are as deadly as guns, and where sexual nonconformism is tantamount to treason.  This is a terrifying movie.  If mythology is the interaction of the human and the divine, then there is nothing mythical about Boys Don't Cry.  It doesn't appeal to your imagination;  rather, it rips you away from your typical movie-going fantasy world, so much like sleepwalking, and confronts you with a devastating reality.What's really terrifying about Boys Don't Cry is that it's a tragedy that happens daily, even hourly.  The central character is a lesbian who fully accepts her sexuality, and is privately comfortable with it.  But she grew up in a society in which her personal proclivities are anathema.  A highly social person, she has nevertheless internalized the norms of her peers. So he must stay in the closet, and divulge her true nature only to those she can trust, or seduce.  She can't escape because her cultural horizons are so limited.  These are the people about whom she cares.  Yet she'll never achieve the acceptance she desires or needs.Some cultures really do destroy people.  This film is an outstanding example of how it is sometimes accomplished.

Especially if they're not sure they want to be a boy. Brandon (Hillary Swank) has a sexual identity problem. She's female, but she desperately wants to be a male. She cuts her hair short and picks up women in honkytonk bars in Lincoln, Nebraska as a way of dealing with her emotional problems. Of course, this sets her up for endless persecution by local rednecks (this movie does nothing to eliminate standard hillbilly/small-town stereotypes), and poor Brandon Teena (or Teena Brandon, her real name) suffers tremendous mental and physical anguish at the hands of those less understanding.Brandon's travails take her to Falls City, where she meets Lana (Chloe Sevigny, late of Kids) and Candace (Alicia Goranson). Brandon hangs out with her new friends, who also include Tom (Brendan Sexton III) and John (Peter Sarsgaard). They drink, they party, they try to outrun the cops in a mid-70's Nova, and pretty much play the roles of Young People Gone Bad. How much you like these characters might depend on how much you identify with them - picture the gang from The Outsiders, for example. There's not much original in these amoral, hell-raising characters; they paint a pretty ugly picture of small-town people. Think your family has problems? Just about every vice and bad character trait is evident in these people, probably doing more to lower outsiders' opinions of rural America than any in any film in recent memory.Needless to say, Brandon doesn't tell anyone she's female right away, which means that in true Hollywood fashion, those very same people who she's come to know and trust - and yes, even love - aren't going to be as trusting when they find out she's female, rather than male. Haven't we seen that a few times before? She can't very well tell anyone right from the start, because then she runs the risk of their ridicule before they get a chance to know her. Ah, but this is a movie, even if it IS based on fact. So when she DOES have to tell them she's a girl, of course most of them react rather negatively. And because this is a stereotypical small town, they react violently, too. I think I saw this before, when the movie was called Frankenstein.Some of the persecution Brandon undergoes is a bit overdone, too - did we REALLY need a protracted, graphic rape scene? I realize that sometimes the audience needs to be shocked in order to be convinced of the character's appeal, but this scene occurred rather late in the film, and by then the audience really should be on the lead character's side.And that brings up another little issue - the motivation of Brandon. I do understand that this is a person (based on a real-life person, too) who is completely at odds with herself - she has the female parts, but longs to be male - and that conflict causes her to seek pleasure and pain simply to survive. But most of her problems in this film are brought on by her own actions. It's not as if Brandon is simply trying to fit in with the rest of the world - she actually pushes the envelope, almost challenging herself to survive, trying to see how far she can go before someone finds out. This isn't a story of someone with  a troubled past simply wanting to move on; this is a story of someone who's a little different than everyone else, and wants to challenge herself, who almost dares others to discover her secret.Don't misunderstand me - this is a fine film, but it has its bad points, too. The first three-quarters of the film are riveting, although sometimes tough to watch. But the last quarter descends into a standard movie-of-the-week treatment of a pretty serious subject, and generally every character becomes a caricature. I watched countless stereotypes and cliches walk across my screen during that last quarter. It's almost as if the screenwriters took an extended coffee break and someone from USA Networks filled in.Another problem is the casting. Hilary Swank turns in some magnificent work (and really deserved her Oscar), but her casting was puzzling, at least from a physical standpoint. When she cuts her hair short in her guy-disguise, that's about as male as she looks. For the bulk of the movie - in full guy-mode - she basically looks like someone's underfed sister. She's skinny and with a gigantic mouth. (And I saw her at the Oscars in female-mode - she's really VERY attractive.) To me, she really didn't look all that male - she just looked young. Now, I'm not sure what else the makers of this movie could have done to make Swank look more masculine, and of course this is based on a true story. Certainly, given the physical limitations of the role, Swank did a remarkable job.All in all, it's a good movie, thought-provoking at times. It's just a shame so many white-trash stereotypes had to be thrown in there as well!

Based on the true story of murder victim / con artist Teena Brandon, the movie glams up the ideal of who and what Teena Brandon was. There is an interesting contrast between the movie and the book. In the movie, Teena Brandon is glorified as Brandon Teena, a martyr for the transgendered cause. In both the book and newspaper accounts, Teena Brandon is neither glorified nor vilified, but treated as she was a young woman who stole, lied, cheated, and defrauded everyone she met in her life.That is the failing of the movie. Teena was portrayed as a hero or a god, but she was a real person, with real faults, as were her killers. What happened was tragic and horrifying, and senseless. But just as one can understand why Teena lied to others about being a boy when she was really a girl (who never had any interest in really being a boy), one can understand why Tom and John would feel betrayed to learn that their friend had lied to them and stolen from them.This movie is an excellent fictionalized account of a true life story. This movie should not be mistaken as true or accurate, any more than Schindler's List, Saving Private Ryan, or Monty Python's Life of Brian, but it is an interesting watch. Pierce has taken a very white trash look at life, and portrayed it on the big screen. Undoubtedly one of the darkest, and most interesting, shows of the year.

The level of homophobia, violence, and absolute fear of the unknown seems more reminiscent of a movie where everything is sensationalized. Unfortunately, it is based on a true story that took place during 1993, where a young woman with a sexual identity crisis was brutally murdered in Nebraska. Exceptional performances from Hillary Swank (`The Core'), Chloe Sevigny (`The Last Days of Disco') and Peter Sarsgaard (`K19 The Widowmaker'), and the marvelous direction of Kimberly Peirce make `Boys Don't Cry' a film of brutal truth.Brandon Teena (Swank) is not all he seems. Brandon is the chosen name of Teena Brandon, a lesbian who prefers to dress and act like a man. She holds herself out to be a man one night at bar and meets some guys who accept her into their group of friends. She also meets Lana (Sevigny), a girl who hates her life and wants to run away from her one horse town. The two become close friends and eventually a relationship forms, however, Lana has no idea until her first sexual experience with Brandon, that he is in fact a woman. Lana is still drawn to Brandon, though, and her secret remains safe with Lana until one of Lana's live in friends, John (Sarsgaard), finds out what is really going on. John, being jealous, a drunkard and all out 'redneck,' rapes Brandon with his friend, and eventually kills her.`Boys Don't Cry' is filled with disturbing images that easily shock the film's viewers because of the level of ignorance and violence that exist in some of the characters. John and his friend Tom spend most of the day getting drunk, high and both have a affinity for inflicting pain on one another, as one scene has Tom showing Brandon the cuts that the two inflicted upon each other in prison, just to see who could take the most pain. The scene of the rape of Brandon is extremely difficult to watch, as is the murder-both are quite grisly, and heart wrenching to endure.Hillary Swank gives the performance of her career. Her portrayal of Brandon garnished her an Oscar for Best Actress. Swank comes off so realistically as a guy, that it's difficult to believe she is actually a woman. Also, her portrayal of the pain that Brandon feels due to her differences from everyone else is done so masterfully, that one can't help but feel sorrow for her. Films like `Boys Don't Cry' send a message to filmgoers that the importance of tolerance and understanding is essential in life. No person is the same as everyone else and it's necessary that society understand that. Brandon Teena wanted nothing more than to be a man. That's not an easy thing to accept, but the point is that to the average person, it's not his or her business what kind of lifestyle someone else chooses to lead. People need to be judged on their personalities and characters, not on their preferences in life. `Boys Don't Cry' drives that message home-if we live in fear of those who are different or that which is unknown, we will bring about the destruction of our own lives, the lives of the people around us. ****  "},{"Title":"The Powerful Effluvia Of Agenda","Date":"30 October 2002","Score":"3 out of 6 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Biography, Drama, Romance","Review":"  In Boys Don't Cry, Hillary Swank is intense and admirable as the crossdressing Teena Brandon/Brandon Teena, in this often violent film of sexual problems in contemporary America, which is based on a true story. Yet it's a movie whose solemnity began to wear on me after a while. Dreadful as the events it depicts are, it's not about Pearl Harbor or the sinking of the Lusitania. It's an ugly story about creepy things that happen in Nebraska. The movie is relentlessly downbeat, yet detached, and as directed by Kimberly Peirce, almost classical in its reserve, as if what we're watching were something of Shakespearean proportions, demanding of our respect. I don't think that the material warrants such a treatment, much as I respect the technique. The people in the film are basically uninteresting once you take the sex stuff away; and there's little either in the script or the personalities of the main characters to suggest thought or imagination. Yet Peirce and her screenwriters bear down hard on the facts, as if the sheer accumulation of detail, of one ugly incident after another, can, if dwelt on long enough, produce a kind of morally neutral (yet at the core deeply moral) kind of art, from which one can infer a pure ideology, shorn of special pleading; and from this the truth shall be revealed. This is an idealistic aesthetic, but an empty one. Art demands input. In the case of dramatic art, there have to be brains working; thoughts and feelings must spin; values be lost and found. The characters in Boys Don't Cry aren't up to this. I sensed about half-way through the film that Peirce and Company were aware of this, and what they were up to was something else altogether, a New Aesthetic, in which the viewer does all the thinking, and the character merely act out. My mind began to wander, and I thought of Big Daddy in Cat On a Hot Tin Roof, and my thoughts turned to a paraphrase of one of his most famous lines I smell the powerful effluvia of agenda here. Now I get it!, I said to myself, as I squirmed in my seat, We, the audience, are supposed to draw the conclusions. The movie just gives us facts bad redneck boys who abuse and rape, and messed-up redneck girls who make love to one another. No peddling of ideas here, just the facts. Right!.

All the poor production value of an independant with all of the non-artistic pandering of a big-budget. Despite this, Chloe Sevigny manages to turn in a very nice performance.

I'm talking in generalities here.) And yet, the main character in this film, Teena Brandon, a person who needs such a fostering environment if anyone does, actively seeks to immerse herself in midwestern small-town life, probably one of the worst situations in the world in which to be thought of as a sexual deviant. While I certainly wish she hadn't been murdered, I didn't like, or have much sympathy for, her character, and try as I might, I couldn't' get very caught up in her plight, which she created for herself (I'm talking about her efforts to take on the specific male identity of Brandon Teena in that specific situation, not her desire to be a man in general) and then hung on to with all her strength until it killed her. Other than her kleptomania, we know almost nothing about Teena's personality besides her gender issues.

I found the actions of the characters so unbelievable I counldn't believe this was anything close to a true story. Warning Spoilers Ahead! I cannot believe that everybody in this film didn't end up hating Brandon after discovering how bad he/she had lied to them about virtually everything. Particularly Lana. And I cannot believe after discovering a person she had been intimate with had lied to her about their sex that she wouldn't be angry. And lastly, why the hell didn't they head out of town when John showed up wielding a gun? Instead Brandon heads back to Candice's and Lana wants to hang out with John? Why? I thought the characters behaved with all the intelligience of Friday the 13th characters. You know, standing there screaming rather than running for the door, when someone is threatening to kill them. I am willing to suspend belief when I watch a movie if it is fantasy or comedy, but when it's suppose to be a true story it is very frustrating to see characters behave so foolishly. In summary, if you watch this movie, I would wager when its over you will find yourself no better off for viewing it.

The picture explores the themes of freedom, courage, identity and empowerment. The film was directed and written by an (previously) unknown female film director Kimberley Price. The movie title was actually named after a song of the same name by an English rock band called The Cure. It's a of those films involving a same-sex relationship - just like Brokeback Mountain (2005).Hilary Swank is a down-to-earth movie actress who portrayed the role as Brandon Teena. Here's an interesting fact about her role To prepare for the role, she lived her life as a man for about a month, including wrapping her chest in tension bandages and putting socks down the front of her pants much the same way that Brandon Teena did. I believe this is the main reason why her portrayal was so outstanding. Boys Don't Cry was the film that made Hilary Swank into Hollywood stardom.Her performance in this film earned her first Oscar for best actress. She deserved it.This is a true story about Brandon Teena and it takes place in 1993. He is the popular new dude in the small Nebraska town of Falls City. He hangs out with the guys, drinking, cussing, and bumper surfing, and he charms the young women, who've never met a more sensitive and considerate young man. He even loves hanging out in gas stations and roller rinks. Life is pretty good for Brandon now that he's one of the guys. He also develops a relationship with a blonde beauty named Lana Tisdel (played by Chloe Sevigny). However, he doesn't mention to his friends and girlfriend that he is actually a trans man. Later in the film, his friends discover that Brandon is actually a woman. He is brutally raped and beaten by two of his friends (which of course actually happened and it doesn't count as a spoiler if anybody has heard about Brandon Teena's story). Her life, as shown in the movie, became tormented (If you are wondering about the torment, you all have to watch the full movie for yourselves). There is a scene in the film that employs a great cinematography structure technique inspired by a scene from Victor Fleming's The Wizard of OZ (1939). In the Oz film, the cinematography structure technique is in the scene where Dorothy exits her house and steps into Munchkin land. In Boys Don't Cry, the technique is reflected in the scene in which the audience see Brandon Teena enter a roller rink and the song Just the Way That I Needed by The Cars is playing. After a shot of the character, he then seen walking through the door. The viewer sees the door opening; the character goes through, the door, and the viewer go through the door. The way that they used this cinematography technique is really fascinating due to the cinematic inspiration.The first time I watched this movie, I was so impressed by the powerful acting of the characters. The skills of the main cast playing really make the movie. Any great film based on a true story should always hire actors and actresses with great acting talent and skills. If an actor or actress doesn't have the necessary skills, the role could turn out badly - just like Faye Dunaway's (even though I still think she is an amazing actress) role as Joan Crawford in Mommy Dearest (1981).Boys Don't Cry is undoubtedly eighth best film of 1999 on my list of top ten best films of 1999. The story in the film was specifically and wonderfully written by Kimberly Price. The film depicts very well a true life story, just like several other true life depictions in Malcolm X, Ray, Alive,Lincoln, and Raging Bull. I highly recommend this movie for people, who like movies such as Brokeback Mountain and especially films that are based on true stories. I give this film a 4 out of 4 spectacular stars!

There are so many forces at play, I feel I have to sift through them all in order to get at my thoughts regarding what is behind this work of art.

I suppose one can get engulfed in the film, in the sense of drama, but I guess I am getting old, and starting to think about films while I am watching them. It was inevitable from the beginning that something bad is going to happen. I suppose we are primed for this by everything shown early in this film, but I do not want to talk about the formal qualities of the film just yet. There is a sort of a time lapse release one gets with this film, at least I did, in that oh, this is the sense of freedom that is craved and one gets when one lives their life without thinking, and, this is the ultimate impetus, as I see it, in this film, which, I suppose, is mirrored in many aspects of American life. I hope it is undeniable that nobody does any thinking in this film, or has any sense of caution, not to say humility, except for the cousin who seems to understand in his bones that the best thing for Tina is to get put in jail, for the short term anyway, because even then her problems are only going to be postponed the way she chooses to live. And to her, it is such an imperative that it is not even a choice in the film what to do. She is so driven by her libidinal and psychological needs so that she can redeem her being in this society, that she is driven like an animal for that personal redemption. With severe blinders on. And, as it is shown in the film, this can only lead to destruction. With animals like those hick boys running around, and quite a few other predatory vectors of rural society, it is impossible, this film shows correctly, to go with the soul so to speak, and find your way and place in this society without thinking...Now it is probably impossible to find one's way through thinking also, it is such a labyrinth in America, so many pitfalls, but at least we can say that caution is necessary for self preservation, this film clearly shows, for people who are willing to think about it. Formally, I can only say that since everything was done perfectly well, even perfect, I can only disagree with the last few seconds of the film which introduces a short time lapse sequence. Was this film like a time lapse sequence? Does the director want to encourage the audience to see this film, finally, as a thoughtless roller coaster ride? I know she wanted to leave us with that cool feeling and exit on a high, but is that really the vision she wishes to perpetrate, or, as I understandingly admit, it is just a kind of an unconscious rejection of right discernment?! From Lana's point of view it was like a roller coaster ride, but why does K. Peirce wish us to consider the film from her point of view at its ending, and not Tina's after all the hard work has already been done? Anyway, no one will notice.

She manages to go through it all and falls in love with a girl who falls in love with her too, thinking she is a boy. So far so good. But what will happen when her real identity comes out? And that is the drama. The brothers or local boys of the neighborhood of the girl who has fallen in love with Teena Brandon decide to take justice in their own hands. First they teach a lesson to that Teena and rape her ruthlessly. But this ends up in the sheriff's office and that is only the beginning of the end. Then the two boys decide to expedite real justice and they kill Teena along with another girl, and mother, that happens to be there at the wrong moment with her baby. The two culprits will be taken to court, tried, convicted and sentenced. But what can we do with such a tragedy? How can it be possible in our modern world that a gender crisis in the mind of a girl may cause such disorder among the people around her? How come the boys react so violently whereas the girls or even older women seem to be a lot more tolerant? What makes such a gender crisis so dramatic? There is no real answer and simple male bigotry is not enough to explain such events. Is malehood such a privilege, such an unsharable dignity that any woman who will desire to assume some of it for herself will turn the surrounding men into criminals? We are dealing here with sex or gender fetishism. But how come it is stronger among men than among women? Or would it be the same in reverse if a boy tried to assume a female identity? I am not sure. Men must feel particularly menaced by the gender wavering of a female who could thus penetrate the secret citadel of malehood without being a member of the brotherhood. Is it really an old story? Definitely not. It could happen again any time, and I would even say it does happen all the time here or there, openly but probably most of the time unknown of anyone because self-censored by the culprit of such wavering.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris Dauphine & University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne "},{"Title":"Boys Don't Cry","Date":"29 December 2006","Score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Biography, Drama, Romance","Review":" It happened all so suddenly.

Oh come on, you know what scene I'm talking about where Brandon Teena , or Teena Brandon is running around after she just had sex with a girl that didn't know she was really a hermaphrodite and had a posse of her male friends try to track her down.....rape comes to mind , but however I think they might of just silly stringed her and threw her on top of a roof or in a garbage can. Wouldn't that be less punishment from what she really got???Kimberly Pierce had done research on this movie for five years and shown absolutely nothing to me!!! Lana wasn't there the night Brandon Teena got murdered, they just threw her in there at the end to make the story more poignant and compelling. Conception drowned out!!! I was so lost in this movie that by the end , I had to question the moral of the story and if Brandon Teena was really a girl or a guy, or something Ed Wood made up before he passed on. Why when Lana went to the police station to pick Brandon Teena and after Brandon Teena revealed the Teena part of her name and what established that did Lana say I don't care if your half ape or man or whatever and touch her hands , only to be thrown into another exciting engimatic scene where she is confronted by the fact that Brandon Teena however is really a woman after John and Tom force Lana to discover the anatomy...the true, anatomy of this person(unless your someone that never went to school at allll). OK I see these are Nebraska , white trash civilians....or what Kimberly Pierce wanted us to see that is. They had very high optimism, especially the two main characters , Brandon Teena or Teena Brandon and Lana Tisdel. But for heaven sakes, a movie with much high potential and skill just fell flat once Lana kept on insisting Brandon was Brandon and the Teena part of the name was just floating around in the movie by accident.I give this movie 8/10 just for the fact it was disturbing, and I had seen the documentary before viewing this film and had never felt such terror inside of me for anyone on the last minutes of their life. The documentary says it all and has all the essential figures you need to account for what really happened. But in this film, I liked how it was directed, nothing really special, but the scene where Brandon Teena is watching herself through Lanas friends and mother and seeing her sexual crisis identity diminish or contemplate the same way in Oliver Stones Born On The Fourth Of July where Ron Kovic hallucinates he is saying bye to paraplegic, hello I can walk again!!! In the same sense it speaks to me, just who we are and what we want in life!!! It was a gender bender delight and it will confuse you, but to me, I think that is the whole morale of this film!!!

Ignore the hype and Oscar win, this is TV movie of the week standard. As everyone knows it is based on a true incident, but the trite way the story is presented here beggars belief. It is simply NOT believable. Plot holes abound, the characters are cardboard, and Hilary Swank is badly mis-cast. She is way too pretty to be believable in this role! And I didn't find her portrayal of a male convincing in the least.Chloe Sevigny is better as Swank's love interest, but her performance was nothing to write home about. The only movie I've liked her in so far was in Steve Buscemi's 'Trees Lounge'. I  detect a slight air of condescension in her white trash roles here and in the oh-so shocking 'Gummo', the latter being not much more than a glorified Sonic Youth video. Sevigny and main squeeze 'Gummo' director Harmony Korine are part of the hip New York art elite, and one can't but help feel their patronizing, superior attitude.The only impressive thing about this overrated tripe was Peter Sarsgaard and Brendan Sexton III as the redneck dudes. Sexton has been quietly building up a strong reputation appearing in movies like 'Welcome to the Dollhouse' and 'Hurricane Streets'. Sarsgaard has had small roles in movies like 'Another Day In Paradise' and 'Desert Blue' (the latter with Sexton), but is a revelation here. Both actors tower above this mediocre rubbish and hopefully will go on to bigger and better things.

I was most taken with the content and the way it was shot, the fact that we are SEEING life as experienced by Brandon, not seeing Brandon portrayed negatively through the eyes of an outsider. That in itself is inspiring, considering the current fashion of telling the story through the eyes of the bad guy. There are still far too few real female protagonists, and Brandon was especially 'real' - about as far from a glossed up boob-implant model as you can get! I found her desire to be a man convincing, and believed him/her as a character. My (male) friend had trouble being convinced that people would believe that she was a boy, but I think it was pulled off quite well. 'Being convinced' is one problem that arises owing to the visual objectivity film allows us. I think that if you were THERE, and met someone like Brandon and could see how convinced THEY were that they were male, then one would tend to be more easily persuaded.For all its virtues, after watching this film one should follow it up with a cup of tea and some light comedy like Monty Python - the content can be a little jarring.

I didn't like these people overall but had sympathy with Chloe Sevigny's character.I too thought Swanks' performance was incredible - she acted very well as a male but in no way was she convincing as a male.  This is not for her lack of trying or lack of ability, though.  This was a big roadblock for me - I can normally suspend disbelief for lots of things but I couldn't believe that the characters in the movie must not have thought she was a girl. First, start with the physical aspects - she had decidedly feminine features, a small head, small hands, no shoulders and no musculature at all. Also, her mannerisms were never quite male and the way she reacted didn't seem too convincing.  I mean, I know she is just acting but I felt somehow that it was hard to believe anyone could accept her even as a feminine type guy.I felt quite depressed after this movie.

I was prejudiced towards them by knowing the outcome of the story and what their actions would eventually be but when I saw them in the film they were actually likeable, IN THE BEGINNING. Saarsgard even made John Lotter seem creepily gentle before revealing his darker side and finally turning into a monster at the end. I have a suspicion that Matthew Shepard's murderers came across like that when he first met them.Parts of the film bothered me though, particularly the trippy scenes like the power lines and the fast-motion shots of the factory and the landscape.  It was too reminiscent of Oliver Stone's Natural Born Killers/U-Turn phase when the drugs were directing the movies instead of him.  Not that that's a bad thing per se, I just think it was unnecessary and distracting from this film.  The landscape, characters and story could certainly speak for themselves without the technical touch-ups. And I questioned why certain dramatizations were made and others weren't.  From what I've read about the actual story, Teena was murdered in his sleep and Tisdal wasn't present.  That was altered for dramatic purposes, fine.  But the rape occurred during the Christmas season and the murder on New Year's. That was certainly dramatic and wouldn't have required a stretching of the facts.  Other than that, 8 out of 10.

Whether you be gay or a minority, the media at large embraces the tragedy--the more horrifying the better--rhapsodizing in great detail on the brutality of the crime.When I first heard that Brandon's story was being made, I immediately expected the director to make a film to showcase her own tolerance and open-mindedness. Frankly, that was a case of my own prejudices, and I'm glad to have been proven wrong.Boy's Don't Cry isn't about standing on a soap-box, and it isn't about a woman pretending to be a boy. There is no Shakespearean melodrama to be found in this raw, uncomfortable film. Where Shakespear's tragedies end with ironious twists and forlorn loves, Boy's Don't Cry leaves you feeling drained and sickened. You don't feel better about yourself as a human being simply because you yourself wouldn't have murdered Brandon, there is no satisfaction to be found in the film at all.One of the movie's great strengths is that at no point do they make Brandon some sort of hero martyred to a cause. Brandon is presented as an often-times foolish boy who simply wants to live.For the viewer, the movie runs like a train wreck.

The movie is about Brandon Teena, born Teena Brandon, who dresses up like a man and goes from her home town of Lincoln, Nebraska to Falls City in search of a better life. She befriends two ex-cons, John and Tom, and falls in love with Lana, who return loves him back. If anyone out there is willing to see a great movie that will leave you speechless, I recommend  you go and watch Boys Don't Cry.

Whereas most of the year's best movies touch upon weirdness in the urban/suburban American society familiar to folks like me, Boys Don't Cry is set in the hell-hole of Falls City, Nebraska. We are presented the gut-wrenching and sadly true tale of a young woman (Hilary Swank, who won't be unknown after this Oscar-worthy performance) who looks, feels and acts just like a dude -- a fearless and charismatic little dude from a bad home with a yearning for love and acceptance. The object of his desire, a bored young babe named Lana, is played magnificently by yet another budding star, ChloÃ« Sevigny.The work of yet another first-time director, Kimberly Peirce, all aspects of this film -- particularly the dialogue, cinematography and acting -- are first rate, although one might argue that it could have been about ten minutes shorter. Peirce (who also co-wrote) evidently allowed herself a measure of artistic license in developing the screenplay, but I am glad that she left plenty of warts on Swank's gender-confused character rather than setting her up as an unrealistic martyr. I found it easy to view Boys Don't Cry at the Dr. Laura Level (i.e., a horrific fate is destined to befall compulsive liars who hang out with sick people and thrive on committing dangerous acts), but my more powerful reaction was admiration for the bravery, humor and basic human dignity the two main characters somehow maintained in a poisonous small-town environment that would make Jerry Springer wince. Thank you, God, for responsible parents with sense enough not to live in a place like Falls City, Nebraska -- there but for your grace go I.

Brandon Teena was above all a human being, and his murder deserves to haunt the American landscape.

Pierce captures the Midwest in its garish glory (unlike its white trash cousin, Gummo, which blanched out its landscape like a wasteland) and loads it with beer, highways, sky, cigarettes, guitar rock, and rage. The script deftly manages to round out potentially cardboard characters with little or no confessional or sentimentality -- the players don't reveal anything that is not necessary, leaving an air of mystery to everyone, not just the strange hero. The young cast (except the actress playing Lana's mom, whose excellent performance should not be overlooked) manages the emotionally charged and incredibly intense material almost effortlessly, without crossing the line into exploitation or camp (even the brutal violence in the film, which I might consider exploitative in other films, is unfortunately quite appropriate here). Swank should be applauded for her portrayal of the confused and hungry Brandon, as should Sevigny, for turning a white trash Juliet character into someone multi-faceted and real. Becky from 'Roseanne' puts her acting experience to good use and does a fine job as well, as do Saarsgard and Sexton, who is almost unrecognizeable here.Although the film is difficult to watch at times, it is an incredibly told story, and should not be missed.

Based on a true story, this fictionalized tale relates the experiences of Teena Brandon (Hilary Swank), a sexually confused youth that decides to live as a man. Her relationships with a group of people in a Middle American small town is vividly brought to life by the performances of several unknown young actors who bring these folks to life. It's surprising the real life people haven't been on Jerry Springer. But then again, maybe they have. To tell too much more would definitely spoil the revelations that are peppered throughout the film. It's not a movie for all tastes. At the screening I attended quite a few people walked out less than halfway through the film. I really can't see the market for such a story. However, those who see it will experience the work of a gifted new filmmaker (Peirce) as well as the birth of some fine acting careers. Hilary Swank really had to put herself out there to create this androgynous character and make her realistic and sympathetic. Chloe Sevigny as Brandon's love is also a find. On the male side, Peter Sarsgaard and Brendon Sexton, are realistically brutal and animalistic in their scenes of rage and violence. Producer Christine Vachon, when interviewed at the screening, stated that one of the film's most moving scenes, a police interrogation of Brandon, may seem unbelievable and incredibly insensitive of the officer. However, the dialogue for the scene was taken verbatim from the taped transcript. The scene is Hilary Swank's finest moment.

It premiered in USA, was screened at the 56th Venice Film Festival in 1999, in the Contemporary World Cinema section at the 24th Toronto International Film Festival in 1999, was shot on location in the city of Dallas in the state of Texas in USA and is an American production which was produced by producers Jeffrey Sharp, John Hart, Eva Colodner and Christine Vachon. It tells the story about a 21-year-old female-to-male transgender named Brandon Teena who after being thrown out of her temporary residence in Lincoln, Nebraska in USA where she has been living in a trailer park with her cousin named Lonny, goes to a bar where she meets a woman named Candace and a man named John and follows them to their home place. Brandon wakes up in Falls City the next day and calls Lonny who invites her back on certain conditions, but when Brandon is about to return she meets Candace and John's friend named Lana whom she takes one look at and decides to stay. Distinctly and subtly directed by North American filmmaker Kimberly Pierce, this finely tuned and somewhat fictional tale which is narrated mostly from the protagonist's point of view, draws an intimate and throughout involving portrayal of an American woman, impersonating as a man, who whilst awaiting a court hearing falls in love with a woman named Lana Tisdel who works at a factory and lives with her mother, and becomes initiated within her circle of friends. While notable for it's distinct, naturalistic and atmospheric milieu depictions, fine cinematography by cinematographer Jim Denault, production design by production designer Michael Shaw and costume design by costume designer Victoria Farrell, this character-driven and narrative-driven story about hate crimes, identity, friendship and love which efficiently merges surrealism with realism and which underlines the dignity and courage of the person whom this biographical indie is a recognition of, depicts a heartbreakingly heartrending study of character and contains a great score by American composer Nathan Larson. This sociological, romantic, graphic and humane drama from the late 1990s which is set during a late October in 1993 in Falls City, Nebraska in the United States and where a transsexual person with an unknown background whom has acknowledged the consequences of being herself in the society she lives in takes her act, which in her case is the only way she can be the person she really is, too far, is impelled and reinforced by it's cogent narrative structure, substantial character development, subtle continuity, diverse characters, use of music, graceful scenes between Brandon and Lana, the lyrics sung by Swedish singer Nina Persson I close my eyes for a moment I'm still there&#x85; and the authentic and memorable acting performances by American actress Hilary Swank, American actress ChloÃ« Sevigny and American actor Peter Sarsgaard.

Writer/director Kimberley Peirce started this project first with a documentary (or it might have been her short film) based on the true story of a young girl from Nebraska who disguised herself as a man, and was raped and murdered, and then Peirce got the go-ahead to make this independent film. Teena Brandon (then rather unknown, Insomnia and Million Dollar Baby star, Oscar (her first) and Golden Globe winning, and BAFTA nominated Hilary Swank) dressed as a man, mostly to get used to the idea of what it would be like to be one before her operation. She called herself Brandon Teena, and with her new persona made some male friends, including John Lotter (Peter Sarsgaard), Tom Nisson (Brendan Sexton III) and Lonny (Matt McGrath), and some female (the sex was now more attracted to) including Kate (Alison Folland), Candace (Alicia Goranson), and of course, the girl that she would fall in love with Lana Tisdel (Oscar and Golden Globe nominated ChloÃ« Sevigny). The film basically sees Teena/Brandon making a convincing life as a man, getting a girlfriend that after finding out is pretty much okay with it, and the only person that knew before was her brother Brian (Rob Campbell). Soon enough though, the male characters find out her secret and first exploit it to others, then rape her, and in the end it was John that murdered her, maybe accidentally, maybe intentionally for her/his lies. The rape scenes are very disturbing, and the murder is tragic, this is a very convincing performance from Swank as the hero(ine), and a gripping film. Good!

BOYS DON'T CRY, however, sets itself on a higher plain than its little brother, and admirably achieves this point of comparison without resorting to cheap sensationalism.Because it's based on a true story, the movie immediately has to overcome a certain amount of scepticism, and, to be honest, it doesn't always succeed. Perhaps Hilary Swank is the weakest link here.   Her performance is sublime, she has all the right moves, but she just doesn't look like a man &#150; even a weedy, underdeveloped man; she looks like a sexually confused slip of a girl who wishes she was a man which is what, presumably, Tina Brandon was. So why don't any of the &#150; let's face it &#150; trashy characters comment on this?  And why would an ostensibly straight girl like Lana believe &#145;Brandon' was a boy, and fail to notice the fact that &#145;he' wasn't, even after having sexual contact? (Yeah, I know there are ways and means for those so inclined, but I don't believe an unwitting participant would be in the dark for too long if those methods were used on her - which suggests Lana knew all along, but it suited her for other people to thing Brandon was a man). Obviously, such doubts aren't the fault of the movie, but they do considerably undermine the core of its story.   I can only believe that the true Tina Brandon was a lot more butch than Hilary Swank; that would at least explain how Brandon manages to develop a sexual relationship with Lana.As a movie in its own right, BOYS DON'T CRY is superior fare, paying meticulous attention to detail and character to such an extent that the pace tends to meander without worrying too much about plot &#150; especially in the first half hour &#150; which may tax the patience of some viewers.   It contains many appealing touches on the way, though, such as Brandon chasing Lana with his/her camera, and taking a snap of Lana as she unknowingly smokes a cigarette at a factory window.   Such moments, absent of dialogue, capture his/her feelings for Lana more skilfully than any words could.The movie also raises an intriguing question because, even after learning that Brandon is actually a woman, Lana has sex with her, even though she is not a lesbian.   It's difficult to determine what you would do in her position.   Was there a, possibly latent, leaning toward homosexuality on Lana's part, or was her love for Teena/Brandon so strong that it transcended gender?Performances throughout this movie are excellent throughout.   Swank excels in a challenging role, and Jeanette Arnette is memorable as Lana's troubled mother.   But the best performance, in my opinion, is given by Peter Sarsgaard as Lana's cousin; his borderline psychopath is believable throughout, even when he finally topples over the edge.The inevitable showdown, when Brandon's duplicity finally comes to light, is filmed with a raw brutality that is difficult to watch, and captures the tension and trauma without spilling over into melodrama.   But that's not the end of the story, and what follows is even more harrowing.   Having said that, the movie perhaps goes on a little too long after Brandon's true identity is revealed.

I wish I could see that award ceremony again to witness her triumph and be glad for her. Prior to seeing this movie (or any movie with Hilary Swank for that matter), I didn't like her. In the media, she appeared unfeminine and rough to me. but now I will be sure to see other works of hers.Well, I turned on this movie and I saw that she was dressed like a boy. I wondered if she'd taken a bet of some kind, or if maybe she was undercover, or even on the run. Then I realize, No, she's dressing this way purposefully, because this guy--her brother?--is arguing with her. Ah, I see, maybe she's trying to be gay the easy way? The movie progresses and I'm still trying to get the gist of it. I eventually see her kiss a girl. I automatically start to think, Maybe this isn't my kind of movie--I can't really relate to this. ..Especially not with my judgmental mother-in-law-to-be in the room. Besides, it seems like just another cheapy lesbian movie made solely for the sake of further acclimating the public, focusing on an agenda rather than truly influential subject matter. I couldn't have been further from the truth.I'm not so sure I like this character who isn't honest with her lovers. I continue watching anyway. She goes to much trouble to conceal her gender; She binds her breasts, alters her voice, stuffs her men's briefs, wears oversized men's shirts, does exercises to build up her arms somewhat, and even uses a life-like toy to satisfy her unsuspecting female lovers in bed. No one goes to that much trouble just to have a little fun or to fulfill a little fetish. I can see this girl desperately wants to be who she's driven to be, in an environment that would do much more than to simply shun her, but to destroy her--and make it hurt.She makes friends with a group of people her age, gets accepted into their family, and falls in love with Lana--who loves her in return. Even the relationship is workable--as she used her toy to do the deed. She's feeling wonderful that she's finally living her life the way she needs to. Sadly, she's mixed up with the law and must pay for her past crimes, all the while trying to keep her true female identity a secret. As expected, she's caught.Seeing as she travels with nothing but her knapsack while drifting down one unknown road after another, I can see by her actions that being true to her spirit is all that matters. As Lana confronted her in that jail cell, I held my breath, knowing for sure that that seemingly ominous draft that just swept by is going to topple this intricate house of cards that means everything to Brandon. Surprisingly, Lana follows her heart and accepts Brandon as is, not caring to know what her true gender really is--Even when Lana's overprotective guy friends forcibly tear Brandon's pants down and force Lana to look at her genitals. Everyone but Lana turns on Brandon and they're convinced that Lana's been brainwashed by some sick, malicious freak of nature. It eventually leads to Brandon being roughed up by Lana's friends John and Tom. They take him out in the middle of nowhere and brutally rape her. Brandon seems to cooperate with Tom and John afterwards and escapes to tell her story to the police. Rather than be brought up on charges of rape, Tom and John set out to murder Brandon and Lana and Brandon's hopeful love becomes ill-fated. It's a race against the clock. Everything comes to a boiling point when all but Lana's mother are together at Candace's (one of the group of friends, with a little baby).Nothing could have prepared me for what happened next. Only a true story can end so horribly. In a scene where the slightest thing can tip the needle into the danger zone, Lana watches as Brandon is shot, murdered right in front of her. The gunman is so psychotic, he shoots Candace as well--who was pleading repeatedly not to hurt her baby. Lana almost gets it herself, but the other man stops him.I really can't do the last scene justice, but I know what I felt the sensation of something inside of me trying to unsuccessfully stomach the injustice of Brandon's life being snuffed out for nothing. I couldn't help but be reminded of the theme in To Kill A Mockingbird. Brandon didn't hurt anyone by being who she was. She was simply trying to *be.*Hilary Swank was very convincing as Brandon Teena and that's what I applaud most. It's rare to see someone act so convincingly, as if they were channeling their alternate universe counterpart who happens to have experienced the subject matter. I'd say she equals Angelina Jolie's talent in this movie. And the knowledge that this stuff is real sends chills up and down my spine.On a report cardscale, I give it an A.

I thought that Boys Don't Cry was a superb film.  It deserved the Oscar that Hillary Swank won.  She gave a wonderful performance.This film showed the insensitivity of people in authority and the common thinking in this country, that anyone who is different deserves what happens to them.  Hate is a very common word in the English language. Unfortunately, people have stood around passively for too long and it is consuming the world.  As we have seen in Kimberly's telling of the story Brandon was accepted by some,but those that felt threatened responded either with hatred (the two killers) or with passivity and acceptance(the mother and friends).   The bullies rule in this country and have for many years. Hatered is alive an well in the USA.  When John Trotter is hanging out with Brandon they are fine.  When his masculinity is threatened he must show his power to mask his fear.  Rape is a crime of hate.  What was done to Brandon Teena was unacceptable for men and women.I am a heterosexual woman and any crime against another human being is intolerable.  Unfortunately, hate crimes have been allowed to flourish in this wonderful country as well as others for many years.  Until people stand up against them we will have more.  These films are a way of getting this information out to the people.  There are many forms of hate crime and they can be as obvious as blowing up abortion clinics, lynching people because of their skin color, beating someone for their lifestyle or as seemingly innocuous as obscenities toward someone overweight, cutting someone off on the street because one thinks they cut them off first. A Hate Crime is just that HATE.I am amazed at some of the comments I have read by others on this site. Someone who watches this movie for the great rape scene is disgusting and yes, wouldn't have enjoyed this wonderful piece of work.

I personally know 3 transsexuals (male turned female), and all three told me their parents had intended for a girl, and treated them like one (dressed them up like girls, called them girls nicknames, the whole works. One was even raped by his own brother). Anyone who doubts this can happen, just remember that more than one person walks straight into jail, and leaves gay because they were raped inside (I'm not saying that every or most gays were raped or misraised and therefore traumatized into becoming one, much several were and are).And another thing. Recently I read in  an interview with a convicted necrophiler (guy who rapes corpses) and child molester. He defended himself saying that society didn't have any right to punish him for accepting who he was and therefore indulging his desires and needs. He wasn't hurting anyone regarding raping corpses (worked at the morgue, so he didn't trespass any grave), so people should let him be. He even said that if a man is entitled to have sex with another man, why not say, brother and sister (they can adopt), or father and daughter (same), or man an pet (never mind), or man and a corpse? As long as there's mutual consent (a corpse has as much legal protection as a basketball, he said), it's none of our business.Yes, he's a sick f#$%. But he's sort of got himself a point though. When does something (sexual preferences, car preferences, whatever) stop being just a personal characteristic that one (and we) should accept (one likes blondes, or blacks, whatever) and becomes an issue that should be addressed and treated, not just indulged (one lusting after babies, your own daughter or sister or mother, or a pet, or worse, a decaying corpse). It's a fine and not so clear line, yes, but I just don't accept that because one doesn't seem to hurt anyone (in the short run) doing X or Y thing, that X or Y thing cannot possibly be wrong (don't believe in black and white views, there's much gray in them, and us all).

In this review a few actual facts are revealed. Some readers may believe the information to be spoilers.)Hilary Swank is an remarkably talented actress, too good for the material in Boys Don't Cry, the new drama based on the true story of young Nebraska woman Teena Brandon, who was raped and killed after experimenting with her sexual identity. Swank and a immovable supporting cast, together with Chloe Sevigny, Peter Sarsgaard, and Brendan Sexton III, grant success for Kimberly Peirce's heartbreaking, although mislead, depiction of vivid events. The acting saves the movie and the Academy Awards recognized several of the better performances (Swank even won Best  Actress). What the movie does not do is understand the true depths and emotions involved with the main character's intentions.Teena Brandon (Swank) becomes confused about her sexual identity and therefore cuts her hair short, stuffs her pants, flattens her chest, and exchanges her name for Brandon Teena. (We will use he when referring to Brandon Teena). Brandon travels to Falls City to clear her mind of an awaiting court date for grand auto theft. There he notices a townie girl named Candace (Alicia Goranson), whose ex-con buddy, John (Peter Sarsgaard), befriends Brandon. His other companions, including Tom (Brendan Sexton III), Kate (Alison Folland), and Lana (Chloe Sevigny), welcome this new pretty boy as one of their own.Romantic sparkles fly between Lana and Brandon, arousing John's jealousy. Soon their relationship becomes sexual, and the closer the two become, the more cautious Brandon must be in keeping his actual identity a secret. The other's begin to suspect something suspicious when they find tampons and a dildo under his mattress. When they eventually learn of his gender, John and Tom brutally rape Brandon. When the police do not take charge of the criminals, a few days later Teena is slayed by the two.The posters of Boys Don't Cry reveal a peculiar tagline A true story about finding the courage to be yourself. Understood the movie flows understandably and clearly and the style is disturbing and vivid, Kimberly Peirce directed with a perverse and edgy mood. But the movie lacks an extremely important element the defining of Brandon Teena's mental status. Even if we simply accept the notions of Teena wanting to be a boy, we want to know why. Is this young woman a lesbian? A transvestite? A hermaphrodite? Are her intentions aimed towards identity or homosexuality? Is she actually a lesbian who wants to be normal--therefore a sex change is necessary? None of our questions are answered dealing with Teena's intent, and the entire movie is based on those vary feelings.I previously reviewed this film negatively; the filmmaker's failed to develop ideas, but it is now that I realize the actors are really what it is all about. It was up to Swank to portray a confused character, and she did a great job with the slim material provided. As I said earlier, the actual production is unworthy of such great performances, but thanks to the terrific actors, Boys Don't Cry comes off as a satisfactorily passionate piece of work. That is more than the majority of movies these days.

Admittedly, `Boys Don't Cry' was a competent movie with fine directing and performances by the actors.  Hillary Swank certainly delivered a performance worthy of a best actress award.  However, the brutal ending sequences seem to cause viewers to overlook the real message of this movie, which is far more controversial than the final outcome.Of course, no one deserves to be raped and murdered. What I find disturbing are some of the viewer comments that suggest this movie is about `tolerance' (probably the single most politically abused word in the English vocabulary in the last five years) and that it *shockingly* revealed how cruel people were to a young girl *just because she was gay*.But in this movie, Teena Brandon was not just a girl who `happened to be gay', but who pretended to be a boy and *tricked heterosexual girls into being involved in a homosexual romance.*  In the first ten minutes of this movie, Teena lures a young, unwitting, heterosexual woman into a brief, romantic fling.  The girl was obviously upset upon finding out that Brandon' (Teena) was a girl. After a lynch mob chases after Teena, all she can do is smile and proclaim, `how great it was.'Thus we can only assume that those who view this movie as a depiction of `intolerance for gays' would say that is was `wrong' for the heterosexual girl to feel this way and that it is OK for homosexuals to deceive heterosexuals into romantic and sexual encounters because any heterosexual who is not comfortable with this is a `hate-monging', `intolerant', `bigot/homophobe'.  And I thought that the gay community was trying to convince the rest of us that it is not within their agenda to impose their lifestyle onto others?Had Teena Brandon disclosed her sexuality to her would-be partners before any intimate encounters, I would have felt far more sympathy for her. But the fact that she was brutally raped and murdered does not make her actions in this movie any less irresponsible or immoral.  Hence, this movie is in no position to preach tolerance for a character that does not deserve to be a martyr any more than she deserved to be killed.  The `Hate' police can have their say now.

BOYS DON'T CRY is an emotionally shattering, hard-hitting movie and easily the best film of 1999. The movie tells the true story of Teena Brandon, a young woman who follows her sexual self-image by misrepresenting her outward identity. She cuts her hair, bandages down her breasts and begins living her life as a man named Brandon Teena. While not revealing too much about the story we come to realize that she will eventually pay for the deception.Director Kim Peirce reveals a world where people go bumper skiing, get chased by cops and sleep on the couch with the television on. It's a film with the same kind of feeling as, let's say BADLANDS or DRUGSTORE COWBOY where the movie's effectiveness has a lot to do with the small mannerisms or details in the realistic setting. I will say, without praising the film too much, that I had some misgivings toward the deception. I was happy for Brandon and his relationship with the Sevigney character, but I questioned the approach she took to pulling it off. Nevertheless, how their relationship develops is incredible and is possibly one of the most impressive love stories I have seen in film.

Chloe Sevigny is absolutely dazzling, while Hilary Swank deserved everything she got, her performance was also brilliant and realistic.Boys Don't Cry is one of the best films of 1999, and it is as amazing as it is brutally disturbing.

Lana never felt deceived even as Brandon, standing in his jail cell, fully aware that there is nothing he can say or do to hide the fact that he is a woman, looks painfully into her eyes to hear her say, I don't care. In their own way, it was a cheerful, loving moment of their relationship. Only the audience knew the doom; to Brandon and Lana, it was the beginning.The killings were unjustifiable, but I really felt compassion for the two killers. They weren't anonymous or cold, they were human beings like Brandon, struggling to find their own identities. Peirce painted a vivid picture of their dead-end lives, forgotten just for a moment through alcohol and drugs. The time-lapsed cinematography of the smoke billowing from the factories, the clouds flying through the sky, the characters seemed suspended helplessly in their personal hell.Even as Brandon is savagely raped, we're not asked to feel pity for Brandon, nor anger at the rapists who were once his friends. It was a venting of the frustration of their inability to be what they don't know how -- that only Brandon was able to do -- be loving. From their broken homes, respect for women, or even for themselves, was never on the list. Boys Don't Cry. I didn't cry, but I knew deep inside my heart, I was crying for Brandon, Lana, John, and Tom, and the two innocent victims. It will never be the same. "}{"Title":"A stunning film.

Brandon Teena goes to a few bars to pick up some girls, however, he is chased by a mob (probably angry fathers). Why? Brandon is a woman. Brandon then goes to another city in Nebraka and meets Lana(Chloe Sevigny) and a group of her friends including John Lotter(Lana's ex)and Tom ???. First John and Tom think Brandon is a good guy and a good friend, until they find out about Brandon's true identity. Lana, on the other hand, falls is love with Brandon and still loves him even after she finds out his secret.Brandon and Lana feel they are true soulmates and they want to stay together, however John and Tom disagree. They embarrass Brandon by taking off his pants and show it to everyone, including Lana. Then John and Tom brutally rape Brandon on Dec 30 (i think). Brandon pressed charges, so John and Tom decide to kill her. She is shot and stabbed in front of Lana (however, in real life i don't think lana really witnessed Brandon's death). They also kill 2 other people, but not Lana. John and Tom were arrested and you could tell Lana is trying to go on without her soulmate.It makes me sad that Brandon had to die at such a young age (20 or 21) and I feel bad for Lana. Brandon was basically sexually confused and different. She did not deserve to be killed because she was confused. Brandon should've been more careful, he probably would know what would've happened when Lana and her family and friends found out, but at least she or he had the strength and courage to do what she believed in.

Please stop making me feel wrong for the location I have picked to raise my sons... Based, very loosely, on a true story, Swank is Teena Brandon, who cuts her hair short and becomes Brandon Teena. She is a troubled soul with big dreams about owning a mobile home park, and who likes to pass as a boy in order to be with other women. She leaves Lincoln, Nebraska and lands in Falls City and meets up with The Center of the World's Peter Sarsgaard, who introduces her to his screwed up extended family. Everyone here drinks too much, smokes too much, and works dead end jobs so they can leave this godd**n town. Swank meets Chloe Sevigny, falls in love with her, and they make plans to leave Nebraska for a glistening fantasy life in Memphis. Then the cornhusks hit the fan. Swank is imprisoned on a traffic violation and is found out to be a woman. Everyone reacts the way white trash should react, and the final forty five minutes of the film is an orgy of drunken rape and murder. First, let me state that Hilary Swank deserved every award heaped on her. She has a perfect look, and I sometimes forgot she was a woman as she immersed herself in the lie Teena Brandon lived. I hope Swank can keep up with the promise this breakout role gave her. I am an Air Force brat, and have lived all over the world before settling in North Dakota. For years now, Hollywood has doled out all this cow plop about how horrible it is to live in the midwest, and I am sick of it. No, this ain't paradise, but I will take a forty below wind chill over drive-by shootings and cities that never sleep any day. I like my livin' crime free and devoid of traffic jams and noise. A blanket statement about big cities, you protest? Well, I guess that's the sheltered midwest existence talking- where we are expected to express shock at Rosie O'Donnell coming out of the closet and to get excited if Nickelback plays the state fair. The Nebraska of this film is not Nebraska, and I figured it out early. Kimberly Peirce directs the film with all the subtlety of acid thrown in your eyes, and at one point shows us a director-y shot of a big city skyline- Dallas'. Reading the credits, this film proudly states that it was shot in Dallas, Texas. I was born in Fort Worth, and I graduated from high school in Nebraska, and I can honestly say there more than a few differences. For one thing, the white trash cast here all have Texan drawls that are never explained! The film makers make a point of how horrible Nebraska must be, yet do not even back up their hatred with accurate locations. The entire cast is awful. Not awful actors, awful people. One of the people portrayed sued the film makers for defamation of character, and you have to wonder what other liberties the director took. Brandon Teena does not come off as a heroic martyr, she comes off as an idiot who could not seem to wake up and smell the stale beer and SKIP TOWN. Peirce throws us into this cesspool, never explains WHY Teena did what she did, and still expects us to be moved and angered. Peirce has some good moments here and there, but after all the decadence in the first part of the film, the viewer may find themselves dulled to the horrific rape and murder scenes, which leave nothing to the imagination. If anything, I felt bad for the real people involved, who had to relive this nightmare on film in order to shock an audience. I dare use the word exploitation to describe the extended rape scene and the murders. While these scenes are strong and shocking, do not let them anger you into thinking this film is gospel fact and therefore good cinema. For a horrific true crime story, see the original film version of In Cold Blood, that film will stay with you for days for what they did NOT show This is a ghastly story that needs to be told. I just think the money may have been better spent on a documentary with the people involved, not a skewed perspective masquerading as an independent film. Boys Don't Cry is not worth the tears This is rated (R) for physical violence, strong gun violence, very strong sexual violence, some gore, strong profanity, strong female nudity, brief male nudity, very strong sexual content, strong sexual references, strong drug abuse, and strong adult situations.

This one fits the bill. Some people have commented about how disturbing the movie is, so I won't do a repeat. The rape scene is particularly graphic and horrendous, made even more gruesome by the distinct impression that the victim thinks that she or he was at fault. I think we should note that the main character is not a lesbian, and explicitly rejects that identity when her only real friend calls her a dyke. Brandon is obviously dealing with massive sex/gender confusion issues, but his/her incredible naivete and utter dishonesty are almost unbelievable. One wonders what the character's redeeming qualities are. He/ she lies to everybody about everything. He/she is a car thief, steals money from people who befriend him/her, and involves his girlfriend and others in schemes that end up being life-threatening and ultimately murderous. Brandon is obviously sick and delusional, needs a lot of psychotherapy, and clearly has no idea of who she/he is.  And talk about naively stupid! How could he/she possibly think that he/she could be accepted by the white trash, narrow-minded primitives that surround him/her in rural Nebraska. This is a sad movie, but the only sympathy the main character evokes  in me is similar to what I would feel for a seriously mentally disturbed, self-destructive person.

Period. Don't see it unless you are a fan of bad acting and writing. It's not a fun movie at all, and it is horrible cinematography wise. The beginning moved way to fast to understand what was happening, so when the middle of the movie arrived, you had no understanding of the characters at all except for Brandon. Nothing is explained, so when the graphic violence scenes come, they don't have as much import as they could have because you can't sympathize with the characters, who are all repugnant, stupid hicks who's actions have almost no motivation other than drugs. Also, as a reviewer said, The horrific ending means that Brandon Teena deserves our sympathy, but it does not follow that the film dramatization based on her life's story is worthwhile. For example, we meet Candace in a bar, where he has 12 seconds of dialog with her before a bar fight breaks out. After they flee the bar, they drive 70 miles (from where? to where? we don't really know, the movie is so vague) He wakes up in a field, meets Candace's baby, then that is all the character development she gets. It isn't even clear what their relationship is? are they friends? are they seeing each other? They mentioned marriage, are they married? did they get married in between scenes? from the way this movie jumps around, it's possible. Then they meet some other people (from where?) at a bar, and Brandon starts living in their house, or something. He hangs out there a lot, as does Candace. He calls the older women in the house Mom, but it is not said what their relationship is, but she can't be his mom. Then there are two guys, or maybe there were 3, I couldn't tell because their personalities ran together. They drink all the time, and are violent, and appear to not be related with any of the other people in the movie. Why the mom puts up with them is unknown. While there is no character development, there certainly is a lot of time spent watching rednecks do redneck things. What was the point of the scene with the truck riding? It was really long, and didn't tell us anything or advance the plot. The scenes in Boys Don't Cry seemed to be chosen out of a hat, or maybe recalled by one of the actual people years later, from under a drug induced haze. Then the movie shamelessly uses horrific acts to try to make us care about the characters, but it is far to late for that. Instead, it just sickens and shocks us with the vile acts portrayed. The movie seems to have been made simply off the murder at the end, and written backwards. The first hour of the movie was filler about Brandon's life. I feel like the writers didn't want to give the characters any depth because they had already killed them in their minds.Yes, Hilary Swank was good, but a Swank does not a movie make.

I mean, it did win an academy award, right?  After seeing this, I think that says a lot more about the academy than it does about this film.  I have a feeling even Chris Rock could have taken an oscar for playing the role of Teena.  I'm not trying to say that Hilary Swank did a poor job, but it certainly wasn't the best of the year.  The movie itself held the aura of an after school special.  The script was shody, and the directing was lack-luster at best.  Every character except Chloe Sevigny's was a simple stereotype straight from the Jerry Springer show.  And hers was either lacking believability or proper motivation.  I couldn't figure out which.  The movie itself failed to reach me in the least.  Sure, it's a sad story, but this isn't a historically correct documentary, it's a hollywood movie.  And in a movie, you have to be able to identify with the characters before you can care about what happens to them.  Which I did not and makes me wonder who's giving this film such rave reviews.  So, if you spend your days watching Jerry Springer and COPS and consider it productive, then I'm sure you'll enjoy this film.

Granted, there were a few scenes in which she was very good, but Swank was rewarded more for her character than her performance.No, the movie was not quite historically accurate, but I don't expect that from a movie.  My problem with the film was not the historical inaccuracies, including a lack of several key people involved in Brandon's life, and the presence of Chloe Sevigny's character in Brandon's death scene.  Facts of true life stories have to be changed in order to keep a tight plot and keep the viewer interested, so I can forgive the inaccuracies.What I have a hard time forgetting is the forced hipness throughout the movie.  The speeding lights flying across the highway at the beginning of the film, and the lights flying more quickly than normal across Chloe Sevigny's face at the end of the film, seemed out of place in a traditionally styled character study.And the characters in this film felt forcedly developed.  John especially felt like a forced revelation throughout the film, as if his character was developed simply for the fact that it was developed.  It reminded me of the CN tower in Toronto, which is the tallest building in the world for no reason other than to be the tallest building in the world.So, Boys Don't Cry was a mediocre movie.

Kimberly Peirce, the Columbia film school graduate who became infatuated with the life of Brandon Teena, brings this true-story of one girl's search for happiness and the American Dream vividly to the screen.A beautifully composed title sequence shows us how Brandon Teena's friend helps her dress as a guy so she can go to a roller-skating rink and meet girls. It is clear from early on that Brandon is a self-hating lesbian, frustrated by the oppressive environment she lives in, and feels that her only solace is to don the clothing of boys in order to enjoy the women she can only dream of when dressed as a girl.Brandon clearly has a sexual identity disorder, which is all-so-real when you consider how vividly Peirce illustrates it's cause. There is one point in the film where Brandon's male friend, and future rapist/killer, tells her about his experience in jail. He describes how in jail they would cut themselves with knives and how he was better because he could cut deeper. Essentially, these are men afraid of prison and use self-mutilation as a way of controlling their repressed anger. These are caged animals taking their aggression out on the world-intimidated by anything that is remotely different. The scene is a brilliant set-up to what most audience members know will happen-at least those who know the story.The story is told quite simply but it's psychological depth is endless. Brandon dresses as a boy and runs away to a small town and their falls in love with  Lana (Chloe Sevigny). Lana is genuinely in love with this pretty young boy and Brandon must deal with the fact that eventually Lana will discover her secret. It is a secret that, when revealed, leads to the brutal downfall of Brandon.The film works because Peirce and her cinematographer compel us with images that brutally compliment the gripping screenplay. Throughout the film there are stunning cutaways of exterior shots shown in fast-motion. This is a world that Brandon can not keep up with. It is not until the end, when Brandon's world is no more, that mother nature returns to it's normal pace.Peirce so adeptly explores the psychology of `white trash' and their entrapment in middle America that you are amazed that this is a first time director. These are young people working at dead end jobs, living for beers and cigarettes, frustrated because of the limbo that their lives are in. Brandon is the stranger that they all connect with-feeding off her stories of supermodel sisters (a brilliant lie that she tells to explain away her feminine features) and the way `he' just came into their lives, giving them a momentary release from their tragically pathetic lives.And from all of this comes one of the greatest performances of the year. Hillary Swank, as Brandon Teena, stunningly captures the complexities of a young woman battling with the truth of her self and the lie of covering that self up. Her performance is one for the ages-one of those performances that Oscar so loves to ignore.Peirce directs her actors like a true master. They inhabit their space and spew their words in ways that make you feel as if you were watching this film in real time. And you would never think that a film like this would come across so horrific from the first frame to the last. If you know what happens to Brandon Teena one can not help but feel this overwhelming sense of fear and dread dripping from each frame. A truly admirable film.

In this case, I wish she had stuck to simply assigning reading, though. Personally, I think people can learn much more about hate crimes from reading books or magazine articles and they don't get If this movie makes an impression on anybody at all, it will be for the three scenes involving Teena Brandon (or Brandon Teena, as she went by when masquerading as a boy) getting dealt with by two white-trash thugs named John and Tom who are...not happy to find out that he was really a she. John and Tom go from quite disgustingly confirming Brandon's femininess in a bathroom and forcing his girlfriend, Lana, to see for herself (this scene is disgusting, but probably the most well-done and logical in the film), to raping Teena, to eventually murdering her. These are the scenes that will get people talking and determining the effectiveness of the film, which is um, well, really not that effective.Honestly, if somebody's going to make a film about a hate crime victim, at least focus on somebody who was honest and hard working and didn't even deserve to get yelled at, let alone killed. Teena Brandon's story is unusual, but not exactly deserving of a motion picture, as she was a criminal, dead beat, and a chronic liar. While I don't condone what Tom and John DID to her, I find it strange for character's like Lana(especially Lana) NOT to have been angry or...horrified at Teena's antics, but of course those who were were looked at like villians.And like another tragic, true story, B*stard out of Carolina, these, of course rurally located characters, suffer from severe lacks of brain power. Why, for example,  didn't Teena (the great Hilary Swank, whose potrayal is really not that different from the girl in Just one of the Guys) GET OUT of that town? Maybe she was on her way after the bathroom scene (but got stopped by John and Tom), but there was still no need to hang around and mooch off Candice after her rape. Esepcially when she was less than well-received by the (stereotypically) bad cops...As for John and Tom, if they were so horrified by Teena, why DID they rape her and constantly persue her, until her final death? Basically, after John and Tom were revealed as Terrible Villians, whatever personalities they had flew out the window. And why, by the way, was Candice shot and why (as somebody else pointed out) wasn't any information provided on what happened to her. Did she live or die? Did they get convicted for her murder. What happened to her baby? The more I think about it, the more I realized that a story about Teena Brandon might have been more interesting if told from the point of view of somebody like Candice (who was the one to first reveal to Tom and Lana her suspicions of Brandon ...not really being Brandon) than from Teena.Instead, we get to watch Teena and her dumb criminal past (why did that paper, which was apparently lacking in news to report her not THAT severe crime in the first place, look as though it listed her age as 19, when very boring scenes involving Brandon's twenty-first birthday had practicailly just happened), and same-sex scenes (some one with Lana sitting topless for about ten-minutes and having a very loud orgasm was not only disgusting but EMBARRASSING to watch, considering I live in one of those apartments where you can hear everything) and her useless high-speed car chase, and a bunch of other garbage that does not amount to much besides the aforementioned scenes with John and Tom. I don't think John and Tom should have done any of the things they did to Teena, but I don't necessarily think she was somebody worthy of having a motion picture AND a documentary (which I also get to watch) made about her, either.

A bit like after school specials except that they are intended to point the finger at middle America. It implies that every town is out to kill transsexuals. Simply put, this is not true. They may not agree with it, but they don't go wild and go raping and murdering. The people in the film industry have little concept of reality. So many of their films about their contemporary country are based on stereotypes and preconceived notions made by the industry and the filmmakers before them. It appears to be very narrow minded in my view.Did this happen, yes. Did it happen the way the film portrayed it? Possibly. Does it happen everyday in every town in America. Doubtful. It is simply absurd to point at people and accuse them of something before they have done it. It implies guilt before the crime has been committed. Perhaps it's impossible to do a film about really important matters that deal with 'any town USA'. You certainly wouldn't see the Oscars or so-called 'Independent Spirit Awards' Ceremonies passing out awards to a film about a person struggling with cancer or a kid that did the right thing. Certainly not by their political or social biases that are ubiquitous in their medium. So this makes this film pointless. How about helping out kids with Leukemia? Why not make a film about not killing folk, despite your differences? Oh right, wouldn't get an Oscar that way.

When I first heard about this film, I wasn't interested. Sure everyone was yacking about the deep social issues it presents and blah blah blah.  I didn't care.  Not even the taboo factor (if, considering this day and age, there really is one -- yeah I know lots of people still find it shocking) was enough to make me want to see this movie.  Then along comes my girlfriend and writes to me about how wonderful and moving this film is and how believable Hilary Swank is as a guy.  Usually my girlfriend is right but this time she was dead wrong.  I was bored after only five (yes, FIVE) minutes.  I figured, maybe it's just taking a little long to get started so I sat through another ten minutes.  By then I knew I hated this movie. Hilary Swank is in no way a convincing male (not just because of her obvious physical features but she's too feminine when trying to behave masculine). So I left the film on and went to the bathroom to shave.  After about another 10 minutes (I had no shaving cream), I went back to the movie.  It was still crap.  So I turned it off and popped in Bringing Out The Dead (by far a much superior movie).  I know this movie was based on actual events but I don't care.  Garbage is garbage no matter what it's based on. I know people will REALLY hate me for trashing this movie but I don't care. When I told my girlfriend how much I hated it she was in shock.  In all honesty, I sorta felt I was treating this film harshly since I had just viewed a movie that really spoke to me (again, Bringing Out The Dead) just prior to viewing this one.  Then again, Bringing Out The Dead is a slow paced love it/hate it movie so perhaps the comparison isn't so bad.  After all, wouldn't Bringing Out The Dead be the obvious loser between the two? Yet it wasn't.  I may try to watch the whole movie someday (with ALOT of black coffee and LOTS of soda and candy) but I honestly don't see why I should bother.For those of you that may accuse me of being sexist or god knows what, I actually have liked so-called chick-flicks to the point that I believe there is no such thing.  I might also add that sexual choices and differences do not offend me in any way.Also, for those who think I don't know my ass from my elbow, if you truly want to see a female actor playing a convincing male watch Linda Hunt's performance of Billy Kwan in `The Year of Living Dangerously.'

However, it is fairly obvious that the subject matter of this film rather than the substance (or lack thereof) is the topic of much acclaim. Hilary Swank did nothing to convince me that she deserved the Best Actress Oscar for her performance. Same thing happened last year with Gwyneth Paltrow in Shakespeare in Love. I suppose Hollywood was simply scared into *not* disliking this film, thus thrusting it into the spotlight and making everyone who didn't like it feel prejudice and ignorant. It's like making a film with gay characters is guaranteed success because the film industry is too timid to shake it's finger at such originality and bold filmmaking.This movie was absolutely horrible to watch. The story is incoherent at best, and the whole two-girls-finding-love-in-an-evil-man-infested-world-that-are-punished-for- their-love idea has already been done innumerous times, so the sentiment that this film is so unique and bold and new is bull. I don't care if this was based on a true story. For heaven's sake, don't use Hilary Swank to play someone who is supposed to be mistaken for a guy! I mean, how ignorant can these people be? I'm willing to bet that the real Teena Brandon was much more masculine in her appearance. The fact that all the men who are in this film are portrayed as fat, stupid, and evil simply added to the absurdity of this movie.Kimberly Peirce is an obvious man-hater and it shows very clearly in her directing. And Tracy Granger, I'm sorry, but you have to be one of the worst editors ever in film. Where's the concept of continuity? This film jumps around so much that all you end up getting is one simpathetic look at Swank after another. I'm sure that the public agrees for the most part on this since it pretty much bombed at the box office and nobody is really renting it. Just because you have gay characters doesn't mean that you are Gandhi. Look what happened to Ellen. 0 out of 10.

Therefor the movie wasn't as powerful to me as people made me believe it would be.Yet Boys Don't Cry is a good watchable movie thanks to a very believable Hilary Swank. Even though we get to see her fully nude (don't hold your breath fan boys, her nude scene's are most definitely not erotic.), you would still belief it if it was said she was a real boy. Still I think that ChloÃ« Sevigny performance was surprisingly even better.What the character's relationship's with each other are was completely unclear to me. Who's who's brother sister, father, husband, mother or friend is completely unclear to me which made the movie hard to follow for me at times. OK, I should admit that I was a bit tired while watching this movie (Had worked very hard this week), so maybe things will be clearer to me when watching this movie again.Fact remains that the story is not told in the best way. Even though the movie is based on a true story, the ending still comes out of the blue and it isn't really clear 'why' the things at the ending happened.Still the love story in the movie works, as well as the movie it's message; Dare to be yourself.

It is a sad story, full of weak people--all of them. The documentary on Brandon Teena is much more useful for something that needs facts, not romanticizing.The main character is not even particularly sympathetic herself, and there is no way the story could have been of interest to anyone unless she had been murdered. A 'successful' Brandon Teena would not have captured people's sympathy.The reason I find her completely unsympathetic is not because of her sexual confusion, but because it did not follow that it was okay to use dildoes on girls in actual sex, tricking them into thinking it was the usual member. In the documentary, some of these girls are so ignorant they still claim it was 'real.' Given that the whole milieu is as redneck as possible, it is (while not at all excusable even so) unsurprising that the murder would have occurred, once her identity was discovered by piglike young men.The one possible use of this film is to make you look into the story itself, and to see this very beleaguered impoverished low-life tragedy, which perhaps one might not have done with the documentary alone. So that the semi-fiction film publicizes a story that is not worth dramatizing, but does lead some of us (who were mystified at the way it was celebrated as something important, which it certainly is not) to find the documentary and learn a bit more about these half-literate people we usually associate with the South a little more than the Midwest. Maybe it puts Nebraska on the map. Again, the story itself is very sad and moving, but it is only meaningful as a piece of filmed journalism, which the documentary provides.It doesn't matter to me who gets Oscars, so if Hilary Swank has 2 that's fine with me, even though I thought her performance was perfectly suited to this mostly meaningless film (therefore quite like it.) The Oscars mean so little Garbo never got one, nor did Deborah Kerr or Robert Mitchum or Marilyn Monroe (whom they never even had sense enough to nominate) and Hilary Swank got 2. Katharine Hepburn got 4, only 2 of which were truly as 'deserving,' if that word can be used for these ignominious awards, as some of her greater roles, such as 'Long Day's Journey Into Night.' That says it all to me. I think Hilary Swank should get 5 Oscars, given how absurd they are.
