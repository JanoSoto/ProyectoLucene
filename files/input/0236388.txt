The film, a record of the highest-grossing comedy tour of all time, is not revolutionary and says nothing new about comedy or those who practice it.  But it's chock-full of laughs, magnetism, and good, rollicking fun.The concert in Original Kings was taped at Charlotte, North Carolina's Charlotte Coliseum, and it's a great testament to the often unfairly neglected stand-up art that comedy performers could fill such a prodigious space.  The MC of the evening, who holds forth from an elaborately decorated stage set, is the WB's Steve Harvey, who has a wonderfully exasperated stage persona and a voice full of gusto as he sounds off about the stupidity of Rae Carruth, the idiosyncracies of black church elders, and the asininity of the band on the Titanic playing as the ship went down.  He's got a rip-roaring sense of energy that gets the show started on a good note.D.L. Hughley's set is perhaps the lowlight of the film.  His delivery is not as punchy as that of the other performers, and unlike Harvey, he seems to use profanity as a crutch rather than as a proper comedy tool.  Still, his performance has its moments, and he's likable enough that his onstage time doesn't get too dull.Fortunately, things pick up when Cedric the Entertainer, a big, cuddly bear of a guy in a chocolate brown fedora, takes the stage.  His set is the highlight of the film, full of sharp commentary about Tiger Woods, blacks on the space shuttle, and the particulars of a ghetto wedding.  He fills the stage with his expansive body language, and his silly dance interludes are among the best moments in the picture.  Someone should give this guy his own TV show, and fast.Closing things out is Bernie Mac, an abrasive, raspy-voiced, pop-eyed provocateur whose act is the most down-in-the-dirt of all the performers featured.  His riffs on the virtues of beating children, the problem of living with a gay six-year-old nephew, and the importance of a certain twelve-letter-word to the black vocabulary, are sometimes more hostile than funny, but his gritty delivery and fast pace socks the best jokes home nicely.  Besides, the audience in the theatre where I saw the film gave him applause at the end of his set, the only performer onscreen they did that for, so who am I to argue?Lee's direction sometimes gets in the way of the performers, with showy camera moves that distract from the words.  The film is at its best when Lee's cameraman, Malik Sayeed, just plops his camera down and lets the comics do their stuff.  There are some nice reaction shots of the crowd, who are clearly having a great time, and the way that the laughter of the onscreen audience blends with that of the people in the theatre really makes you feel like you're part of the show.The Original Kings of Comedy is not as great as earlier stand-up films like Bill Cosby Himself or Eddie Murphy Raw, films that fell together more cohesively than this one does.  Still, if you're looking for some Friday night laughs, you would be well advised to head to the theatre and hail to the Kings.

I have been exposed to stand-up ever since I was a little kid, and I have seen the evolution of stand go from 90 min concert movies like this one, down to 1 hour specials, and even down to 30 min specials as well.  And The Kings bring back a variety show for us in the movie format, and the result is a masterpiece.For those of you who only saw racism in the jokes, then you really weren't paying attention to what was being said, and knowing the attention span of the average American, that's not hard to believe.  Did anyone notice that the WHITE people in the audience were laughing just as hard as the black?  I think that it's because most of us white folks can take a joke, and understand that the comic is really playing around, without doing a my god, that's a racist remark defense that many people here seem to be doing.  What these men were doing with comparing black and white is NO DIFFERENT than when Jeff Foxworthy compares and contrasts rednecks and sophisticated people.Now, the fact that the comics were using stereotypes...hmmm.  How do I  say this?  Folks, I have collected comedians for years, and my collection spans from CD's, DVD and VHS tapes.  I have comedians that few people have heard of.  My collection spans over both genders, different nationalities and ethnic groups, and I must say that every comedian needs to joke about something that the audience can and will understand, and stereotypes are the key thing to do just that, because everyone understands stereotypes. And besides, some comedians will even take a common stereotype and make it their act...Tim Allen used the stereotype of the man's man; Roseanne Barr used the disgruntled housewife, and Jeff Foxworthy used the redneck angle.  Now, a comedian can go without stereotypes, but he/she runs the risk of losing the audience.  And besides, it's not the stereotype that makes the joke, it's the exaggeration behind the joke.And as far as the comedians in the movie here, they really strive for a good show.  Steve Harvey did great jokes, and even did things, that while not really funny, were great entertainment, like when he was playing samples of different songs for the audience.  Hughley was funny as well, especially when he was interacting with the audience.  The other two comics I have never sen before, but I have no complaints, as they round out the show nicely.  Each comic owned the stage when they were on it, and they would be hard to top.  And folks, I like Chris Rock, but he wasn't as funny as these guys are, simply because he tries waaay too hard, and these guys are just here having fun.A great performance by some great comics, and I would recommend this to anyone.

Not so much a movie, but a filmed appearance of the four comedians (Steve Harvey, D. L. Hughley, Cedric the Entertainer, and Bernie Mac) at a show in  North Carolina.  It has been my experience that concert-comedy-type movies can often be boring, certainly not matching the experience of actually seeing a comedian live. This was not the case with Kings.  Granted I was in a crowded theatre, but the expert direction by Spike Lee really pulls you in and makes you a part of the studio audience.  Audience reaction shots and multiple-camera angles keep the viewing fresh and behind the scenes peeks all offer more than simply being there live would have.  As far as laugh volume, this was the funniest movie I've ever seen.  It has everything swearing, raunchy sex jokes, clever comparisons between blacks and whites, pop culture jabs, and even some insult comedy.Each comedian does about a half-hour of material, but you'll wish they each got an hour at least.  The soundtrack is excellent as well.  Well, it's not technically a soundtrack, but the songs played in the stadium at the show were a great mix of old-school love songs and funk.The Original Kings of Comedy is not a movie.  It is a concert-comedy piece with elements of a documentary.  After a lack-luster summer of gross-out comedy flicks, it was very nice to see genuinely talented and witty word-slingers come together with a consistently pleasing director in certainly the funniest movie of the summer.

Harvey in particular makes me wonder because he seems to be closest to the world the jokes come from, the most genuine presence. He establishes great rapport with the audience, in turns R&B showboat from the chitlin days and church pastor. But every time I see him he's also a crotchety, country bumpkin uncle, not entirely an act this. One of the highlights is when he gets thousands of people to hoot and swoon as he reminds them of the value of love while playing old favorite songs; but frames the moment as the good old days by comparison to modern rap.Bernie Mac was a bit of a cipher, in that I couldn't make head or tails of half of what he was garbling about and then he has an aggression (one of the jokes I think was about having a gay 6 year old nephew) but it seems to come from a good-natured bedrock so I couldn't tell if he was being off-putting or not. It's obvious with Harvey where similar jokes seem to come with a streak of nasty dismissal.It was Cedric out of these 4 that stole the show for me. He's cool, an Isaac Hayes whereas everyone else were manic James Browns. All the others focus on other people and how they annoy, he surrounds common folly. Two of the best jokes in the whole show were his, black people running if they see someone else doing it, and black people cruising in space cars to the moon after white people if they tried to sneak out the planet.But my favorite performance here was the whole as a give and take with this audience, the whole room as the show. It makes a world of difference that they are before an audience of their own people, the audience no less a part of what's being performed. It would simply not be the same in Wyoming. It's the difference between Sam Cooke's show at the Copacabana as polite Sinatra surrogate and his appearance at Harlem where all this spontaneous energy is circling the room.People swoon and holler, dance and spontaneously get up from their seats, entered by the spirit of what's going on. There's nothing quite like being able to enter a world as it is of its own self, filling the room with itself.Some fabrication will be there almost unavoidably by us being there to see but it can be leveraged. So I don't mind here the presence of a camera, as others seem to. Lee finds and shows us people having a good time. There's nothing quite like seeing people enjoy themselves either - those delighted looking women in particular. There's a certain loving-kindness that goes beyond what's being said in words. Something moving about a whole room erupting into applause when asked about god, swooning over love songs and laughing without compunctions at life.

Playing to a massive crowd of about 24,000, four African American comedians &#x96; Steve Harvey, Bernie Mac, Cedric the Entertainer and D. L. Hughley &#x96; each deliver half hour segments of material.The film's best routine is arguably delivered by Bernie Mac, who spends 25 minutes essentially advocating that we all cave in to the Id, to do and say as we please, to speak our mind, to not bow to social convention. Gradually, however &#x96; and the audience is giggling too hard to notice this &#x96; Mac's jokes stray into abusive, twisted and violent territory, before he tells a joke about a misunderstanding between a child, a bus driver and a mother. The audience cackles at this joke, not realising that it's revoking and calling you to re-evaluate everything that went on before.Visually the film is conventional, though Lee does places a larger emphasis on audience members than is typical of such concert features. His cameras stay close to the crowds, and he uses an abundance of audience reaction shots to heighten the levels of intimacy between performer and public. Ironically, The Original Kings of Comedy bolsters the kinds of African American stereotypes Lee's films tent to critique and destabilise.7.9/10 &#x96; Worth one viewing.

The script, in a word FUNNY. Judging from some of the movie theater audience reactions to some of the jokes, The Kings demonstrate the power of today's leading kings of stand up. Pryor and Murphy would be proud to pass the crown down to these funny men. Steve Harvey (the best MC in the business, sorry Martin), stole the show with his antics about ol' school music and black folks on the Titanic, stirred the crowd to a frenzy before each of his fellow Kings took stage.So why do I hate this film? Answer SPIKE LEE, The RIGHT movie, wrong director. I paid $9.50 to watch a bad Spike Lee home video. Try sitting through a feature-length film of images transferred from video onto a giant silver screen, It is no picnic, believe me. The production values were non-existent. Transferred video images show pronounced jaggies from anti-aliased edges, a obvious result of bad video compression, VERY distracting. I'm sitting in a Loews state-of-the-art theater with stadium seating, a curved screen, dolby surround sound, getting dizzy from all the fuzzy, out of focus, video images with scan lines flying across the screen. My portable DVD player has better resolution than that. To add insult to injury, Lee placed a unmanned, motorized video camera in front of the stage, making it pan left and right by remote control (for a similar effect, try taping a videocamera to a remote control car and let it go back and forth, at full throttle while filming a subject). PRODUCTION NOTE to aspiring film makers Jerky camera movements will induce motion sickness and bad headaches.Dumb move, Spike. Documentary style filmmaking can be funny too. Learn from Robert Townsend who directed Murphy's RAW. Watch Alek Keshishian's Madonna Truth or Dare. Why not take the viewer to really meet the Kings while on their tour? Lets meet some of the Kings family members. Why shoot the entire film in North Carolina? It is a 2 year tour right? Why not do more backstage and behind the scenes? Why did you not interview audience members? Spike, Wazz up??As for production values, Spike, we gotta draw the line. Just because it is easier for you to shoot video, doesn't mean you have to. People get up and go to theaters and pay good money to watch FILM. NOTHING compares to images captured on conventional film. WE GOTTA HAVE IT!Coincidentally, one of the trailers played before the Kings feature is an upcoming feature film also directed by Lee entitled Bambozzled or something like that. it looks like Lee shot the film by himself, left the mike in his pocket.

I talk to Terrence at my job sometimes, and I even liked Urkel on 'Family Matters.' I don't understand why these particular Black guys have to get up on stage and tell jokes about race, which I understand to be racist. I don't think their jokes about Black churches or Black families are funny. It's not just because I've never experienced either, it's because I have simply deemed them unfunny. Who cares if they were the biggest selling tour in America for several years? I never heard of them, so they must not be relevant. They probably all portray drug dealers on their TV shows. I know funny. Jerry Seinfeld, Dane Cook, Gallagher and... Richard Pryor (only because he's dead) are it. These filthy negroes are NOT it. It's okay when George Carlin or Jon Stewart curse, but when these guys do it, it's profane. To sum up Andrew Dice Clay = good, a bunch of Black guys = terrible. BONUS!!! Spike Lee is involved, so that makes it extra, EXTRA racist. Not that he wrote one word of this movie, a CONCERT film, but it just always comforts me to call him a racist because he talks about non-white things. If it ain't white, it ain't right.

It wasn't even so much the profanity or vulgar scenarios that they were discussing that bothered me (because I love Chris Rock's work so much), but instead it was more the way that these four men presented themselves and represented themselves on stage. The self-proclaimed ringleader of them all, Steve Harvey, was the worst. The fact that he didn't even have enough material to survive on stage was pathetic enough. That set the tone for the rest of the film that was not a positive tone. His cheap monologue was filled with community insults and personal insults to the audience. I know they may have been all in fun and jest, but to me it never really came across as fun. Either Harvey was upset with the audience presented to him, or he just wasn't ready for his moment on stage, but it just came across as a completely different person than I was expecting. The same can be said for all of them whom were somewhat more concerned about their image than the jokes that they were telling.I don't know why Lee chose this project to place his name on and why he proclaimed these four to be the Original Kings of Comedy. To me that is a bit misleading. If he is speaking about African Americans being a part of comic culture, then I don't think these were the four to best represent it. What about Eddie Murphy, Red Foxx, or even the great Richard Prior? What about Bill Cosby? There just seemed to be a self-proclaimed stigma already attached to this project before we even began it that was hurt with the opening of each of their mouths. I was not impressed by any of them. If I had one dollar to give to one of them for their performance from the evening, and was forced to hand it to one of them, it would have been Cedric the Entertainer. He just seemed the most genuine of them all. His performance on stage was honest, yet bold all at the same time. He was talking to the audience, not above them, as the other performers seemed. While I don't think he was the most liked in the audience, I did think that he was the most talented of them all.Another huge problem that I had with this film was the cut sequences. You know, the moments that we spend talking to them off-stage about their lives and opportunity ahead. This tries to give them a sense of humanity, showing the audience this different side to them than when they are on stage, but what I witnessed was something a bit scarier. It seemed as if each was trying to grab the attention of the camera. Were we dealing with a group of camera hogs that were willing to step on anyone to get to the next level? Whether it is true or not, nothing is said to speak otherwise. While these were created to show their brotherhood, it felt more like filler delaying the inevitable consequence that we were going to go back to a sub-par routine. It was like a tease that hurt.Overall, I was not impressed. I have seen some comedians take an opportunity like this and blow it out of the ballpark, but what I saw with this documentary were four men (possibly five if you count Spike) that just wanted the opportunity to showcase their talent. They were not interested in the audience, or in trying to actually be funny, but instead just be on television. Notice that most of them are doing well now after the release of this film, which means that something worked. I just wish that they had put the same excitement behind their work in this film. From utter confusion to just downright profanity (without a joke), these guys felt as if they were winging it instead of demonstrating to us the power of their trade. I was embarrassed for everyone involved, even the people in the audience, but hope that others will see this review and take heed &#133; The Original Kings of Comedy is not worth the time or effort that you are going to put into it.

Until now, I figured that Harvey must be considered a lower tier comedian than the others, since he hasn't gotten the TV sitcoms and other primo gigs that they have.

While targeted at African-Americans, the humor can be appreciated by anyone willing to laugh at cultural differences.  The theme of the American racial divide runs throughout the film and the four performer's acts.  Nothing hateful is said about any group (with the possible exception of some remarks made by Bernie Mac having to do with homosexuals), and a good time can be had by all.Steve Harvey is a brilliant performer, and he blends standard rehearsed material with jokes he was apparently making up on the spot for the audience.  Cedric the Entertainer had some wonderfully inspired material as well.  My favorite performance came from D. L. Hugely, who's humor hit really close to home for me.  I was less impressed with Bernie Mac, who's style is a bit meaner than the other three performers.  Mac is a funny guy, but after the more light-hearted material of the 3 prior comedians it was difficult to shift gears into his sharp, angry style.  Directed by Spike Lee, this film puts its emphasis on the performances of the so-called Kings (or as Harvey put it Kayngs).  Very little of the film is spent outside of the actual concert.  Interview clips are only a few minutes long, and are not so much interviews as extentions of the performances.  (Slightly more insightful footage is used as supplemental material on the DVD.)  This is not a movie about a concert or a tour, this is a 2 hour comedy special.  It's good for some laughs, but don't expect anything else.

In the most beautiful moment in this concert movie (shot just a few months ago on digital video), Spike Lee recreates the Coney-Island-snapshot sequence from HE GOT GAME using real Kings of Comedy audience members--a pudgy couple in matching Hilfiger, grannies with towering beehives, bespectacled hicks. The cinematographer, Maleek Khan, photographs black skin with loving nuance. (See NURSE BETTY for contrast, where Chris Rock and Morgan Freeman are turned into near-literal tar babies.) And clearly Lee has an affection for the cornpone standup of the Kings. The moment you can feel is nearest and dearest to him comes when the MC, Steve Harvey, assails rap music and extols the virtues of the Al Wilson/Luther/Teddy Pendergrass era. These chitlin-circuit gagmeisters are a throwback to another era--an era before Def Comedy Jam, before the concept of Russell Simmons. Even when their bits sprinkle the F word, they're still clean.The material runs together (white people are like this and black people are like that; music ain't what it used to be; black women got a lot of rules) but the performers save it. My favorite is Cedric the Entertainer, a stout hipster whose offstage persona is ratherly dourly celebral--his bits on the first black President have a nice not-sold-to-death quality. The scariest is Bernie Mac, a countrified aggression artist who does a long aria on beating his kids.

For those of you who say it is racist, do you dare criticize a Margaret Cho, Paul Rodriguez or even Jerry Seinfeld for making jokes about the differences between ethnic groups?  The Kings (or should I say Kahngs) of Comedy do this to a funny effect.  They are not saying anyone is better or stupid just that yes there are ethnic differences between blacks and whites in the same way that there are differences between Italians and Germans.  For all of you folks crying racism do protest the fact that in the history of Hollywood blacks have won about 6 Oscars total?  If anything that is the real racism.  As a black man, it was nice to see a movie starring 4 blacks that was funny and intelligent and didn't involve shooting or gang banging.  Now to review the movie, I have not laughed this consistently hard in a movie in a long time.  All four of the comedians are hilarious but I think the guys who surprised me the most were Steve Harvey and Bernie Mac.  Steve never struck me as especially funny on his sitcom or on Showtime at the Apollo.  But in this special he is on fire!!!  The best bit is his take on Rae Carruth, Titanic, his exchange with an audience member and his daily trips to church as a child.  Bernie Mac had a tour de force turn as well, his description of taking care of his brothers kids had me in stitches (think Robin Harris and BeBe's kids).  This isn't to say DL Hugley and Cedric weren't good because they were (kudos to Cedric for his take on black people vs. white people when it comes to office violence and running from trouble). I applaud all of the comedians for pointing out some of the ridiculous aspects of hip hop and the youth culture today.  My one criticism would be of Spike's early direction of the movie - Spike let the show speak for itself we don't need images you insert ruining the show on stage.  For those of you who have seen it I'm not talking about the vignettes in between the acts I'm talking about during Steve Harvey's first set when Spike decides to splice in some posed pictures of the country folks who are at the concert. My other criticism I have after viewing this film - Why MTV, why Spike Lee did you decide to shoot this on video transferred to film rather than straight to film?  The picture quality is bad (think Blair Witch when they showed scenes shot with the video camera).  I'm sure when it comes to TV it will look much better but it is too bad for the theatrical release that they went the video route.  All in all, I recommend this movie.  It is funny  funny  funny.

Hughley(of the show's The Hughleys,which was on ABC now moved to the UPN network),who explains why blacks do not bungee jump because the concept is very similiar to lynching....Then we have Cedric The Entertainer (also from WB's The Steve Harvey Show),who notes that Bill Clinton would be the closest thing we'll ever get for a black president,and also goes into detail on other things as well like a ghetto wedding,and family members.Rounding out them is Bernie Mac who goes into detail about children and people around his house(which is hilarious as heck when he talks about a 2 year old niece and a gay 6 year old boy going for some milk and cookies).It is for the most part rib tickling laugh out of your seat,but it is one of the best concert films of the year not be missed by a long shot!

Too bad.  The brothas and sistas I was in the theatre with with were dying with laughter all the way through this flick, and ESPECIALLY when Bernie Mac was laying it down.  His example of how a certain word (hint the first part is mutha) can be used a variety of ways in casual conversation between fellas was brilliant because it was grounded in the truth.  Go to any place where some self-styled playas are just cooling out you'll see 'em capping on each other and cussing like pirates just like Bernie Mac.  But just like Bernie's standup, it's all in good fun.I love how the concert was staged so that the two old heads, Steve Harvey and Bernie Mac, emcee and anchor the show respectively.  This was a shrewd move since these guys were the most experienced and therefore just a little more adept at working the crowd to a fever pitch.  DL Hughley was his usual wisecracking, crowd heckling self --I counted at least 8 people that he absolutely nailed -)-- and Cedric unleashed his rapier wit and off-the-wall dance routines that, one point, had me laughing until my stomach hurt. Cedric has always represented St. Louis well and I'm already seeing folks out on the street repeating his classic bits in this movie verbatim.I reiterate  this ain't just a good concert movie.  These four titanic talents provide the sharpest, frankest, and most outlandish comedic insights into black culture and mannerisms to date.  Pryor would be proud.

(Dir Spike Lee) Spike Lee's latest joint is his lensing of The Four Horseman of The Apocalypse, or as they're better known as The Kings of Comedy, during their trailblazing, barnstorming tour of the United States that sold out major venues and is captured in their Charlotte, North Carolina concert with ecstatic, electrified hilarity ensuing.Harvey, best known for his eponymous titled sitcom and host of 'Showtime At The Apollo', effectively balances two jobs as emcee and performer and opens the show with a strong set and may seem surprisingly profane from his tv show image. Resembling comic icon Richard Pryor and very at ease with the adoring crowd, Harvey's is the most polished of the foursome and has some very funny bits on rappers (who he disdains even though they appear frequently on his series; joke taken!), being an old-school arbiter of r&b/soul of the 70s music that whips the crowd into a jump out of your seat dancing frenzy, and his take on the film 'Titanic' ('The band went down with the ship? ?' and proceeds to pantomime Kool & the Gang hustling out with their instruments and equipment hastily and how if black folk were on board making a makeshift raft from a small table and a dinner napkin setting as a sail.Hughley, also known for his eponymous tv hit, hits some high marks with the audience busting on them including a dubious type in the front row who looks like a homeless rap star, and includes bits on hygiene, how black people aren't the most athletic thrill seekers ('Bungee jumping? That's too much like lynching to us') and for my money his best quick take on Jesus being black by enacting the miracle of turning water into wine at a wedding ('Normally, you know, I don't do this &#150; but go on, keep the party goin'!') Chubby and charismatic Cedric The Entertainer perhaps steals the show with his amusing takes on money, being a 'grown adult man', the martial arts, the first black president (on the national debt 'Yo dawg, man tell 'em I ain't got it') and his funniest as a breakdancing machine that has the crowd in stitches. He clearly is having the most fun on stage and it shows.Perhaps the edgiest and angriest of the four has to be Mac who comes on strong and doesn't back down from his verbal assault on children (particularly his sister's three kids he's currently raising) that is funny only when he says that he's saying what we can't but are thinking, his realization that he's not the sexual dynamo anymore with his wife and the overall feeling that this is one comedian who will not compromise his stage persona for a quick Hollywood buck. That's their misfortune since Mac seems to be cut from the same cloth as Pryor in his going for the jugular by incorporating the most painful of his personal struggles.Pryor and Eddie Murphy clearly resonate echoing during the concert yet all four of these talented men have their own unique brand of stand-up and to say them in the same breath as the aforementioned trend-setters is definitely a compliment of the high order.I haven't laughed this hard all summer (except for the shamelessly funny 'Me, Myself & Irene') and have to admit I've only seen these comics intermittently hear and there on tv. They definitely should and do deserve more exposure and it's a damn shame the media didn't give them props in the beginning on reporting the extraordinary business they've accumulated in ticket sales (you have to go all the way back to the Seventies when Steve Martin's Wild & Crazy salad days were selling out arenas and larger venues).This unprecedented happening is only truncated by the lame tack ons Lee splices of the Kings playing poker, hanging on a b-ball court or chilling in their stretch limo. The fact that all 4 are sartorially splendid only underscores just how classy they are even if they're expletive riddled acts are spicing up their material, which only accentuates rather than offends.

It floored me.This isn't Chris Tucker in Rush Hour, who gives us a little black / white humor but he winks at the camera to let us know he's kidding, and there's plenty of self-deprecating humor on both sides of the racial divide. This stuff is real, it's angry, and I didn't see anybody winking.

I find it difficult to find a definition of racist humor which doesn't include much of the humor in this film.I'm not saying that the anger from African-Americans isn't well-justified. Of course it is. But the civil rights movement was all about moving past that and having tolerance and respect for all people. Right? African-Americans have struggled for so long under stereotypes that it's hard to see them caught up in perpetrating them. Is this mainstream culture?

Original implies one of two meanings either previously unknown or unpresented, or the first of some series or set. Clearly the latter usage is out, since these men are not the first kings of comedy. The originals of modern comedy are men like Jackie Gleason, the Marx brothers, Charlie Chaplin, Buster Keaton, etc., and not these 1990s comedians. The former meaning of the word orginal is also a misnomer. Since when did four-letter words and racist stereotypes (a staple in Spike Lee joints) constitute originality? Kings is an easy one to shoot down as well. How can one be a king of comedy if he is not funny? Between them the only one with any success was the emcee with a moderately successful network show to his credit. The rest are clearly usurpers at best. Finally, why should the word comedy ever be associated with this movie? Racism, profanity, misogyny, homophobia and other negative attitudes pass for comedy only to the lowest common denominator of our society.The only aspect of this movie to which I give any credit is that it is a movie consistent with Lee's other celluloid garbage. Lee's joints never fail to appeal to the basest urges of this society's groundlings. Continue your foul work, Lee, and see to it that our country's racial divide is perpetuated.

It was amazing to see the reaction these tunes got from the audience the second they started. Harvey plays on the generation gap of 'rap vs r & b' quite well. I think he was dead-on and the most self-assured of the lot. Best routine-Rae Carruth.Hughly struck me as the youngest acting, his stuff wasn't quite as good or original as the others-but his 'heckle the hecklers' schtick was good. His worst problem is that we've seen his stuff done elsewheres, that's all. He's fine otherwise.Cedric I had never heard of before, and still donno what to make of him. His routines tended to leave me flat, but then he pulls this hilarious Curly Howard 'RUN!' bit that had me going. That stuff I liked quite alot. He's first shown backstage in the john doing Gregorian Chants(!?) and makes a cryptic, off-hand comment about it being from 'a previous life long ago and far away'. If anything I'd like to know more about him, maybe Spike coulda done more background on these fellers.Lastly we have Bernie Mack. Bernie looks like the late Howard Rollins from 'In the Heat of the Night', he's the one closest to Redd Foxx in both subject matter and delivery seems to me. I liked some of his stuff, had trouble understanding a few of his more mush-mouthed lines, and generally thought he is what is generally called a 'regional' comedian, ala Tim Sample in Maine or like Pat McManus in his hunting tales. He had a rural air about him, despite being from Chicago. Mack is funny of course, don't get me wrong. But he like Cedric left me a little flat.

He's got more of a ranting style. It's funny. And surprisingly, although he also cusses a lot, sometimes that even enhances the humor because it's so absurdly inappropriate.

Hughley, Cedric the Entertainer, and Bernie Mac, crack jokes about race, sex, families, and human responses. This film works as a behind the scenes look at a standup comedy routine and just as a plain comedy. There are many incidences of explosive hilarity thanks to the perfect timing and audacity of the comedians. Although more appropriate as an HBO comedy special, Paramount Pictures made a wise decision to release this production nation wide as box office reports prove. That proves American audiences are thirsty for insightful comedy, regardless of format.Steve Harvey is the movie's opening comedian, the most smooth, clever, charismatic, and aggressive towards the audience. He comes on between each performance and does a short reaction analysis with the viewers. Harvey makes some very funny wisecracks about the music industry, the movie Titanic, and stereotypes black churches. He ventures an energetic, high-spirited sense of humor that really gets the audience revved up.Next up in line is D.L. Hughley, the star of the television sitcom The Hughleys. Steve Harvey is much more charismatic in his style of humor than Hughley, who concentrates more on a macho approach to racism, sex, and profanity. That is not to say this comedian's humor is not sharp with an observant comic edge. He cracks some very funny jokes about Christianity and Jesus. He is not quite as energetic or punchy  as the three other performers, though.The third performer is Cedric the Entertainer, who does a perceptive routine on white people's secure hope lifestyle and black people's confrontational wish lifestyle. He also observes how each race deals with presidential debates and Monica Lewinski. Cedric also humors white people's cowardly sights on violence, as well as smoking, the music industry, Tiger Woods, and even space shuttles. All of this is right on the money with his wide range of body language, including a hilarious dance routine. Cedric the Entertainer is perhaps the best of the four comedians in The Original Kings of Comedy.Finishing off is Bernie Mac, star of movies such as Life and The Player's Club. He is the most racially profound and fastest on his toes with perverse humor. His jokes about sex are absolutely hilariously correct. He also explains what the word m*therf*cker means in the black language a noun, a person, place or thing. Although Cedric the Entertainer is the most entertaining, Bernie Mac is by far the most hilarious comedian in the film; he got thundering, explosive laughter from the audience.The Original Kings of Comedy is unsparing in racial humor. However, it is not really prejudice, just racially observant. It compares both black and white people in amusing methods, but does not rip on either race. It takes careful consideration to discuss race in comedy and not go over the top.Spike Lee's sharp direction makes the movie involving. He often observes backstage life of the comedians to give us behind the scenes entertainment; several of the individual comedians are interviewed; studio audience members observing the comedy routine in the film are often examined to see their reactions to the comedian's antics. Lee, who's most recent credits include the raunchy, gritty Summer of Sam, and fable-like Bamboozled, is what gives this film its intelligence, and even though he captures many other aspects of the production, he never lets his style get in the way of letting the comedians bring down the house.
