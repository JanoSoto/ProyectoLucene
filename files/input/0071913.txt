So imagine my horror when I found out there was a sequel! Well, I had to be dragged kicking and screaming to see THE NINE LIVES OF FRITZ THE CAT. By some stroke of good luck or divine intervention, it happens to be better than the original.The film,  made without Bakshi's involvement, (who was knee deep in the controversy stemming from COONSKIN) begins by finding our hero in a slum, living on welfare with a wife and child. The wife is pretty abusive (although she does have a point-you'll understand when you see the film. Fritz smokes pot to escape and imagines himself in nine other lives (hence the title)It's actually a pretty good film. The film is less raunchy and vulgar than the first, but I know some people out there will still be offended. The film is a scathing look at society in the 70's and doesn't have the dated feel the first did. Drugs and street language are present, but it's used much more successfully hereThere is one sequence that is some kind of masterpiece. A white military leader and a black militant are perched on two opposing mountains and they take turns attacking one another. Live action footage and stills run in the background. In just five minutes, they've managed to convey exactly what the racial unrest of the 70s was. There are some flaws. The film doesn't have a very satisfying ending and the score is a little too upbeat for a film laden with such stinging social commentary. But I applaud THE NINE LIVES OF FRITZ THE CAT for taking chances; it could have been more of the same, but instead strives to be better. It's not a perfect film, but it's a good one.*** out of four stars "},{"Title":"Things may get intresting.","Date":"19 April 2000","Score":"18 out of 24 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Animation, Comedy","Review":"  I watched this puppy baked last night.

I just wanted to get that off my chest. Now to my review. I was fascinated by the idea of an R rated cartoon, and Fritz the cat seemed the obvious choice. The film begins with Fritz' wife harassing him about the state of his life. To escape the ranting, he lights up a joint and reminiscences how he came to lose many of his lives. The film ultimately shows that Fritz has no chance to improve his life, as every opportunity he gets he sees as another chance to have sex, smoke, cheat the system, and make an idiot of himself. some trippy scenes follow in this dark movie. I would not recommend this to the faint hearted, the violent scenes of murder and assassination are examples, but if you're looking for something different, give it a look.

So why do I consider THIS the worst? Because it's lazy. The original Fritz the Cat was a decent adaptation of the infamous art of Robert Crumb; this, however, is like fan fiction-made worse by the fact that neither Crumb or Bakshi, the director of the first, were involved. There is pretty much no sign of effort, decency, or humor. This, ladies and gentlemen, is a film that contains GAY Hitler RAPE. I am dead serious-watch it and see for yourself.

With the original FRITZ THE CAT I got the impression that the naughty stuff was true to life, and helped make the characters real and interesting. With NINE LIVES the whole thing just felt like some very bad schoolboy joke that merely shows off the smutty bits for their own sake, and doesn't go anywhere with them. It all seems just a bit overdone. The take on Nazi Germany had a teeny bit of satirical value, but it hardly seemed to be worth the trouble, and the idea has been done a lot more effectively elsewhere.Summing up don't waste your time with this one, unless you're a fanatical completest. But go and enjoy the original FRITZ THE CAT, if you feel you can handle it.

However, that would be an effort and after seeing this drug induced nonsense I decided that this movie was not worth any further effort on my part. Thus I say What a load of crap! A lot of people say that this movie is not at all as good as the original first movie. Well, I would certainly hope not since this movie is BAD and clearly geared towards hippies that survived into the 70's dreaming of a comeback and wannabe drug addicts. It is an orgy in juvenile nonsense and bad taste. The best thing that can be said about this movie is that it is fairly short, only some 70+ minutes, thank god.I cannot say that I am sorry for watching it since it was a bit of life experience (I have not seen the original and I only knew that Fritz the Cat was a bit of a cult thing when I sat down to watch this one) and, as we all know, a lot of life experiences are not that pleasant. However I am still in a bit of shock knowing that some people actually liked this depraved trash.Even though the general concensus seems to be that the original movie was better I do not think I will make much of an effort trying to watch it.

First of all i think it's nothing more than a cash-in on the first movie. Second the animators are not the same, the director is not the same, actually quite a lot isn't the same as the first one, which is a bad thing, since this second fritz movie doesn't have a proper story line, or a good script, actually it doesn't have anything of the things that made the first movie so wonderful. The feeling is gone. Still it's Fritz the Cat and all is not lost, but all through the film i get the feeling that the director just took all the ingredients of the first fritz movie and mashed them together to a lifeless pile, sticking them in here and there, maybe because that's what he thought the fans wanted (and that would make more money). Then he managed to portray Fritz as somewhat of a loser, which he may be, in some people's eyes', but i don't think that's the feeling you get from the first one. This one is more rough. It's almost abusive to the original. So my suggestion is; if you haven't seen any of the fritz movies, watch the first one only, this one isn't quite worth while. Afterwards you could try the second, but don't get your hopes up. "},{"Title":"Gosh!

As for the comics, I found one issue at the library, four stories. I'm afraid I cannot draw many comparisons, but I am intrigued by Crumb's creation. While not everything controversial is necessarily funny or interesting, it can often point a spotlight(that we usually leave entirely switched off) at something that we actually *should* explore, and finding out where the line goes can serve to get us to reevaluate the boundaries, or at least ask the important question of why to there, and no further?. Yes, this thing is offensive. It's primarily about drugs and sex, with plenty of nudity(some full-frontal, for both genders) throughout, there are numerous bits of bloody and brutal violence, it's disturbing, it's arguably racist, it's definitely disgusting, and it's got a moderate amount of strong language. At its best, it's biting satire, dramatic and even hilarious. I don't know if it's because I'm not American, because I wasn't born when this was made, or if the reason is to be discovered elsewhere; however, sadly, I can't claim that it attained aforementioned glory all that often. Don't get me wrong; this is never boring, the 70 minutes fly by at a marvelous pace(it gets to be frenetic at times). The animation employs style here and there, and can get creative and surreal. It's not all good, and there are those that will find it too basic on the whole, and I'm not going to claim that they're wrong; I don't go for a lot of drawn(by hand or computer) films. There are designs from the graphic novel. Live-action footage is used, mostly as background. Editing can be pretty cool, when it tries to be. There isn't really a plot to this, though several of the characters do get at least somewhat developed. There are a lot of stereotypes in this. The voice acting is great. Our title cat does deliver a little in the way of pseudo-philosophical/intellectual ramblings, an aspect I can recognize from what I read. There is slang in this(I was glad to get Danish subtitles).

Then we flash over to Fritz walking down the street, grabbing his crotch, lets out a fart and offends Juan, the stereotypical Hispanic Cat. Juan won't talk to Fritz because Fritz farted in his area. Fritz makes a lame comment about why doesn't Juan speak English so he can understand him? They talk about Fritz's plight to cash his welfare check. A few seconds later we see some black thug cats outside Fritz's house, talking about robbing this house in 'this' (white?) neighborhood. Fritz is sitting on the couch (yes, he's back home now, I guess? Flashback to earlier years?) about to light up a joint, and he's staring at his little sister's kitty butt. He's trying to get her high so he can get with her. She smokes some, and we get a psychedelic menagerie of images that tries to be creative, but really, someone needs to take some lessons from The Wall's animators. It was a stupid sequence. Flashback to the big mama cat yelling at Fritz again.
