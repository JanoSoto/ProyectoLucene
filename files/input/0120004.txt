When the crates arrive at the museum without the owner there appears to be very little inside. However, police discover gruesome murders on the cargo ship that brought the crates to the US and then another murder in the museum itself. Investigating the murders is Lt. Vincent D'Agosta who enlists the help of Dr. Margo Green at the museum - she has taken an interest in the contents of her colleague's crates. Unknown to both there is a large creature roaming the museum which is gearing itself up for a benefit reception which the city's mayor is to attend. A horrific monster, haunting the lower-levels of the museum, shows up uninvited. Peter Hyam's The relic is a atmospheric, sinister, dark horror movie that scared the hell out of me! I loved the book and the films just as good. There's lots of gory decapitations and the creature effects from Stan Winston studios are beautifully done. A dark work of art, not some crappy Monster-on-the-loose film many have called it. 10/10.

It sets things up nicely before the chase, it doesn't throw in a romantic angle just for the sake of throwing it in, the two leads, Penelope Ann Miller(remember when she was in big movies?) and Tom Sizemore, are both good, and once the chase starts, it's gripping.  Admittedly, there are some flaws; having read the novel first, I knew how the creature came to be, which robbed some suspense(and while I appreciate that they had to take a shortcut to explain things, this was a little TOO short), while the photography needed to be dark, it was too dark at times, and Miller's colleague Greg(I forget the actor's name) veered uncomfortably close to stereotype.

When a similar murder occurs in the Chicago museum Lt D'Agosta suspects a psychotic killer and shuts down the museum.  With political pressures to keep the museum open for an `opening gala' for Chicago's rich and famous, D'Agosta is forced to give way but sets the place up with a police presence to deal with any trouble.  Meanwhile scientist Margo Green suspects that an empty crate of mysterious leaves may have been more than just that and examines the potential that a virus on the leaves caused some sort of creature to evolve.  When the same `evolution' attacks during the gala setting off the security alarms and locking down the museum it becomes a fight for survival and escape.When this came out in the cinema I felt that that was not the best place to see a film like this and decided to wait for video or TV.  I finally saw it on TV last night and feel that my gut feeling was right &#150; the small screen is the best place to see this film.  At a cinema you may have higher expectations than you would if you watched it in the comfort of your own home on a lazy Saturday night and that might have hurt this film because honestly it's not that good a film.  However as a video you perhaps have a lower expectation and then this film is a nice little surprise.It is without it's own style or ideas but it is an effective monster movie which, in a nutshell, is really what it is.  The film follows the traditional formula of all these types of things &#150; monster loose, location sealed or remote, characters separated and picked off in the order you expect until the hero gets the better of it.  In that sense this is without any new ideas but and doesn't shine on the plot front but it is an effective little movie.  Not particularly scary but more gore than I expected and the film manages to keep the beast frightening by keeping it in the shadows for the majority &#150; even after we've seen it, it is still shot in darkness.  In fact the way the film is moved into darkness adds to the tension and makes it more exciting.  Of course it isn't fantastic but it does do what you expect a monster movie to do, which is my point.  It's main weakness is that it plays it very straight (although the mood made by the darkness helps this) many monster movies have successfully gone more tongue in cheek and done well (Deep Rising from the same period comes to mind.  However, having gone the straight road the film does stick to it well despite a very unlikely explanation for the beast.The cast are par for the course with this type of film &#150; no big stars but support cast given bigger roles.  Sizemore is on good form and is at home in the lead of this type of film, I doubt he could carry a blockbuster but he is good.  Miller has done better films and she is OK, sadly she is lumbered with all the science stuff and isn't as impacting until near the end.  To contrast the two characters there was a 20 minute spell in the middle where both Sizemore and Miller are absent from the action (in different areas) &#150; I noticed Sizemore's absent but it wasn't until Miller came back that I noticed she was gone.  The rest of the cast are the usual monster food and you can almost predict who will live and die without 30 seconds of them being introduced &#150; selfish arrogant scientist? How long do you think he'll last!?Despite this and other clich√©s the film is good enough to watch as long as you know what you are getting &#150; it is certainly better than a lot of the creature feature movies you can get at your video store and the mood produced by the director in all that darkness helps it along nicely.  Not great but better than average for the genre. "},{"Title":"A pretty good scare.

They brought the story to a close before you got bored with the monster.

The film gives us some odd ideas concerning characterizations.For example, Detective Vincent D'Agosta (Tom Sizemore) is a VERY superstitious policeman. He obviously believes that old-fashioned good luck plays a major role in life- witness his response to the idea of stepping over a corpse (Don't step over it! It's bad luck!) and the importance to which he attributes the position of a dropped penny (Face-up or Face-down.) And indeed, luck DOES play a major role for him he enters the security control room just AFTER the two guards on duty have been killed and the monster has departed; when he runs after Brantley in the tunnels he finds the creature's lair and the decapitated body of Brantley just AFTER the Kathoga has headed upstairs for a snack.I also like the characterization of the Kathoga. Unlike the Alien in ALIEN, the Kathoga doesn't seem interested in killing anything for the hell of it. It kills the humans for the hormones it needs to live, and it kills the first of two dogs (we don't see it, but obviously the dog attacked it, hence its response was quite normal.) When the other dog whimpers and cowers against a wall, the Kathoga stops momentarily to look at it, but since the dog doesn't possess the necessary hormones and isn't attacking, the creature moves on.On to special effects. I liked them, too. The attack sequence in which the beast makes a standing leap at the SWAT man on the rappelling line, soars in a perfect arc through the air and brings the guy down is a great visual piece. The monster itself was very well animated.One more thing in most older horror films where someone ships something, the item sent causes some sort of havoc once it reaches its destination; in this film the item shipped provides the key to what the creature is and how it became what it was.I think this is worth the time of anyone who likes a good, old-fashioned monster movie.

Best feature is that none of the major characters behave idiotically to further the plot.  One never feels compelled to yell Turn around, stupid! or No. Don't go into the basement alone! or Please turn on the lights! or (to the heroine) Don't you remember it's invulnerable to bullets?  The heroine is afraid throughout the movie (shouldn't she be?), but is she irrational at any time?  The curmudgeonly, wheelchair-bound senior researcher is trapped on an upper floor, but does he emerge at the end from his place of hiding behind the computer console?  The detective is disbelieving at first, but does he obstruct and endanger in the end?  The science may be unbelievable (it's like finding a mummy curse) and that prevents this from being a great sci fi, but the behavior of the characters seems authentic (researchers who know their environment) and that is this movie's major strength.

The Relic fixes that matter with a clever idea; the characters don't really know what they are facing. This was what made great all the monster movies in the past.Peter Hyams with The Relic delivers the necessary amount of scares and also generates some real suspense, and construct the ambient of museums and archeology correctly.Both Tom Sizemore and Penelope Ann Miller are great here, and it is a real mature detail that the script doesn't force a romantic involvement between them. This kind of details may appear to be useless but they actually allow the scriptwriters to be more creative. In that aspect Vincent D'Agosta (Sizemore) is really an unusual hero, plenty of flaws he certainly is not the all-ready for action cop we'll expect, and Dr. Margo Green (Miller) is the same case but as sidekick.The movie doesn't let the viewer take a breath, and has some unexpected revelation and some well achieved gory moments but not abusive.

So I spent my savings on it, and when I got home I saw it alone at night. I jumped a few times, specially on the see where we see for the first time the monster attacking. The story is awesome and imaginative, like the ancient relic and the lost tribe that makes a drink with some leaves that further in the film we see that those leaves carry a red fungus that contain lots of different animal hormones. He drinks the drink, and starts to feel strange, and later he transforms into a creature that needs those leaves with the fungus to survive. If he doesn't has the leaves he rips off peoples heads and eats its hipotalamus(part of the brain)that contain the same hormones. Then the monster goes to the coal tunnels and reaches the museum, and strange murders happen in the museum. The special efx are good as so the mechanical beast. Tom Sizemore has a good role playing detective Vincent D'Agosta, so as Penelope Ann Miller playing Biologist Margo Green. Both acting and dialogue is very good. And I truly recommend this one if you are a monster movie lover like me.I give this one 9 stars. Enjoy it if you dare see this movie.

The story is well told (D Preston and L Child did a great job in putting their marvellous novel on screen) and although obviously a lot shorter than the book none of the important elements are missing. Especially in the beginning you might get the impression that P Hyams is more concerned with the camera work than the actual directing but as the movie continues these thoughts become secondary - together with an interesting cast he achieves to make the movie as good as possible, considering it's obvious limits. Another thing that I was very impressed with were the special effects. There aren't many but the ones they have are great. Especially with FX I tend to believe less is more.

The Relic was just about the single most entertaining monster movie I had seen for many long years prior to its release. To this day, I am still struggling to understand what made the novel so special. Some people here seem to believe the book was better than the movie. Well, you know something, folks? The book was flat-out garbage! Perhaps I'm being too critical when I say that. But, in all honesty, I have always had trouble getting through books with more than one author. I guess that was the main reason why I could never finish the book this movie was based upon. The writing styles of the two authors kept conflicting and never quite fused.This was easily Peter Hyams' best overall film! Regardless of what the nitpickers may claim, the script was very well written, the dialouge was snappy, and the monster was just about the most ferociously terrifying thing I've seen on a movie screen since Alien. Believe me when I say that Stan Winston really outdid himself with this bad boy! All throughout the film, before we even see this creature, you hear an unsettling wheeze that sets your spine on edge. I kid you not. It gets to the point where you're literally asking yourself, what is making that noise? That was the fun part of this movie for me. I loved that aspect of it. And, of course, when the people in the museum begin turning up with their heads missing, that's when the real roller-coaster is set in motion.I would advise anybody reading this to simply ignore all the negativity they've read regarding this film. It is nowhere near as bad as these cynical reviewers are making it sound. Check it out! And, if you really want a cool effect, watch it on Halloween night with all the lights off!

I thought at the time (being 15 and all), that it was a pretty cool horror movie without actually knowing why. Watching it again recently, I finally understand why I like it more than the usual rubbish that passes for horror nowadays.The Relic is pretty starts off weird with an inexplicable (yet ultimately rewarding) opening scene, then for most of the movie it veers into a police investigation. Very rarely do we get a monster and it all focuses on the characters and their mundane conflicting interests. So there's Lt. D'Augusta and Sgt. Hollingsworth trying to figure out how their case at the docks connects with a museum murder with the same MO and the overall relation to Dr. Margo Greene's story and her entwining connections to the case.The film builds on each character so they're never faceless when in the last 40 minutes, the film rapidly switches gear into a full on monster movie (One of Stan Winston's decent designs before he was shunned in favour of CGI) and people start getting picked off in true horror fashion. Weirdly enough, it never feels like two different movies. The whole film is about conflict (Greene's science vs D'Augusta's superstition, police vs rent-a-cops, heroes vs monster, etc) and the story's narrative integrates itself pretty well into the themes on display.There's a great handle in editing and direction at one point where exhibition opens; D'Augusta and Hollingsworth finally realise they're dealing with more than a serial killer in the sub-basements and sewers, while everyone upstairs is oblivious to what's happening below. The movie for a while just keeps flicking between these scenes leading to a nightmare scenario that lasts the rest of the movie. Strangely though, the editing gets too frantic after this and makes several scenes confusing at times (probably to disguise the monster and the remaining budget...)Yes, there are some bad moments...plot holes get the film going, the CGI is very dated ('expensive then, but easily recreated now' kind of look), the creature seems to pop up everywhere within seconds and the lighting, though realistic, is just too dark to truly appreciate the visuals. Oh and there are several characters who are unlikeable just because they need to justify the body count.It's a decent movie though and one to watch if you want something a bit different rather than the usual stalk-and-slash.

I have never read the book - although I am planning to once I get a spare minute - but from what I see here it should be one hell of a read!From the outset, The Relic appears like any other monster movie. To be fair, I suppose it is, but scattered scientific facts throughout help to give it a very real and believeable edge, without making the viewer feel inadequate when it comes to the genetics part. Although much of the jargon is probably a mess to any big scientist, here it works well and gives the whole movie a very sophisticated edge that too regularly monster thrillers decide to throw to the ground in favour of multiple deaths.A perfect balance of character development and full-on horror is evident in The Relic. True, the first forty minutes or so are a little slow, and nothing of note really happens (with the exception of one jolting death). But it's a clever tool of the trade that director Hyams uses in order to create in-depth, likeable characters that the audience can eventually root for. Penelope Anne Miller, like so many of today's horror movie heroines, created an incredibly smart and instantly likeable woman who is sensible but fun - do I sense a touch of Laurie Strode in her? With her, Tom Sizemore (who looks like something of a cheap George Clooney replacement!) is great with his pithy and quick-as-a-whip remarks, and his superstition is a pretty cool aspect which adds depth and feeling to his role as well as the film.It's surprising that The Relic has as much clever characterisation as it does, as it is set - excepting the opening sequence - entirely in the Chicago Natural History Museum. Not once do we leave the place in order to follow a character home, or to see them interact with their families. But it works shockingly well, and the Museum is a creepy and original setting for all the macabre goings-ons. John Debney's ominous and suggestive score helps to heighten the creep-factor, and something genuinely sinister can be found in The Relic.Now to the special effects. Ever since CGI was invented in the early nineteen-nineties we have seen so many movies that have taken cheap options and had daft-looking, over-ambitious (not to mention totally unconvincing) effects. Not in The Relic, however. Obviously with a fairly large budget, all the special monster effects in the film are remarkable and help believeability in their authentic look. The creature itself (though resembling the Predator slightly at times) is an amazing and awe-inspiring fiend - not to mention downright scary. And the final twist of the movie is one that jumps at the audience in such a right-field manner that it makes an excellent final shock which leads to a breath-taking climax.VERDICT A clever, quick-witted monster-chiller with a great lead and some dazzling special effects.

This party is the film's climax and involves Frock, D'Agosta and Green trying to kill the monster while Dr. Cuthbert, the Mayor and several guests and police attempt to wade through chest deep water in dark tunnels under the museum in order to escape (but of course there's something in the water).  I would say this movie is a mix between The Poseidon Adventure and Predator. The acting is very good and is aided by the chemistry between Miller and Sizemore and veteran actors  Hunt (who won best supporting actress 1983) and past best actor oscar nominee Whitmore.

To me, a relic is some old artifact, and I figured this had something to do with a curse, such as bringing something dead back to life. In, uh, reality, this is about re-arranging existing life, remolding it through wicked biological mutation inside a very basic 'monster-on-the-loose' plot. A very basic drawback for me has to do with visuals, but not the FX, as one might expect. Hyams, the director, also functioned as director of photography (as is usual for him) and I believe he might have been aiming for some extra spookiness in all the scenes taking place in the dark (or, over half the film). But he over extended himself here - the scenes are just too dark, or else the transfers of this film to video and DVD failed to follow someone's instructions. Instead of jumping at the scares, a viewer may instead find himself straining to figure out what's going on. Some of the basic plot turns are clumsy early on, we are shown the results of a massacre on board a ship, yet the ship docked without problems (?). So, the massacre happened right after it docked (?). No one at the port noticed anything going on...? However, the cast is good Sizemore has the wiseguy veteran cop role down pat; Miller is sexy in that coltish brainy redhead way; Hunt is always interesting; and Whitmore never gave a bad performance in his 50+ year career. The main innovation in this creature feature is that the main action takes place in a huge museum (in Chicago). There's also more mention of the 'hypothalamus' - a section of the brain - than in most movies. Otherwise, it follows the old standard formula of political expediency versus common sense law enforcement. Everyone thinks the killer is, of course, the human serial-style variety; the cop feels something ain't right; the politicians have their way for a gala event. This is where things take off, with the monster stalking the elites in the darkened museum. To the film's credit, once the tough guys (a SWAT team) show up, things don't fall neatly into place - the monster makes short work of some of these guys. Early use of digital FX was somewhat startling back then; when the thing grabs a hapless cop, there's no need for a cutaway to a different angle, as in the pre-digital days. Yuk.

They hate it because it didn't stick too well to the book. But I don't know what they're complaining about It's an entertaining movie, and a lot of people hated it, and i just don't understand why. It's about a monster that runs rampid in a museum, and eats people's brains, that's it. If you wanted something more, like the meaning of life, you're not going to get it. But anyway, the film centers on a museum, which has just spent money it didn't really have on a new exhibit called superstitions. Needless to say, opening night is of the utmost importance, but the problem is, people are starting to be killed. By what, no one knows, but the murders are way to grizzly and gruesome to be human. So now it's up to Leiutnenant D'Agosta and a museum employee named Margo Green to find out what is causing the murders, and put an end to it before the opening night of the big exhibition. But despite their attempts, they find no murderer, and the exhibition opening still happens. At this point we've gathered that the killer requires nutrients from a plant that it cannot find. It just so happens that the Hyptothalamus region of the human brain also contains those nutrients. So The murderer, or monster,r because if you haven't figured out that it's a monster at this point, there's nothing to be said to you, takes to eating the museum employees brains to receive enough nutrients to survive. And with the big Exhibition opening with hundreds of people, it's pretty much a big smorgesborg for the creature. So when it attacks, a group of people get trapped in the building by a security system run awry. And now It's up to D'Agosta to get them out to safety. I'm not really going to explain anymore of the plot, because doing so would give away the twist ending, and it's also like trying to explain quantum physics in a few paragraphs that i'm far too lazy to type. But what I really want to talk about, is the comparison between the book and the movie. The Book I felt left something to be desired with the end, and a few scenes were just uneventful, like when the swat team goes into the museum. But the movie does a good job of giving the scenes more life. But it also wrote off a few good characters, and had an ending that was completely different to from the book(But i prefer the movie ending to the book ending). The monster is well made, and the movie is just good. My opinion could be different if i read the book before seeing the movie, but the only reason i wanted to read the book is because i saw the movie. Overall, a good movie that strayed pretty far from the path set by the book, but did a good job with giving some scenes better life then the book did.

Meanwhile the faint of heart may want to reconsider enduring this experience. You'll lose count of the number of severed heads. You'll also lose count of the number of times that the filmmakers dare you to accompany heroes and victims down a catacomb of spooky hallways. Special effects wizard Stan Winston has created a huge, slimy, lizard critter with tusks for The Relic that would give Alien, Predator, and those Jurassic Park raptors a run for their money.The Relic is basically a haunted house chiller. Most of its grisly action occurs inside a creepy Chicago museum, within scores of shadowy corridors, labs, and staircases. A dinosaur reptile of amazing agility prowls these premises and feasts on flesh. Mainly, this hybrid monster tears your head off and munches a chunk of your brains. The melodramatic script pays homage to scary sagas such as Jaws, Alien, and Jurassic Park. Penelope Ann Miller plays a dedicated but cute evolutionary biologist who pedals a bicycle to work and worries about who'll fund her research. She shares many of Ripley's heroic characteristics from the Alien franchise, except Penelope doesn't perform a strip tease for the monster. She keeps her clothes on and relies on her wits to outsmart the creature. Burly Tom Sizemore abets her as a superstitious Windy City cop. He wants to close the museum, but the mayor needs it open for a gala fund raiser.Naturally, the monster crashes the gala and heads roll. When the monster isn't terrifying the rich, the museum becomes an obstacle course. The monsters shuts down the power, and the wealthy patrons find themselves trapped in the dark, rained on by fire sprinklers. The Relic aspires to be more than just a horror movie. The worst thing about The Relic is its surplus of plot. What might have been a small horror movie turns into not only a big-scale scary movie, but also a disaster movie. The film opens with a jungle witchcraft scene that is supposed to frighten but winds up being incomprehensible. The filmmakers then build the plot and introduce their array of characters before the finally unleash the beast. Part of the time the scenarists clobber us with a load of scientific, computer gibberish that makes the movie sound realistic. Interestingly, everything that the monster devours becomes part of its DNA and guides it behavior.Peter Hyams lights the museum as if it were the space ship in Alien. Hyams, who helmed Outland and Running Scared, aims to scare the daylights out of you. He resorts to every tried-and-true truck to elicit paranoia and hype suspense. If you aren't family with how horror movies manipulate their audiences, you may find some scenes in The Relic a little intense. Predictability, of course, paralyzes the plot because Hyams spends too much time trying to be like other horror movies so that it breaks little new ground. But the effects may be gruesome enough that you forget the formula that the story follows. Hyams gets great help from composer John Debney whose tense, dramatic orchestral score heightens the tension.The Relic qualifies as a good horror movie boosted by glossy production values. This chiller is worth seeing at least once while you're searching for a genuine classic.

It doesn't pretend to be anything other than B grade in tone, but it does have an interesting and surprising plot twist, which is revealed late in the movie.The Relic features a very impressive monster, both in design and execution. The 'Kathoga' is a full-scale 'physical effect', much like the Alien Queen in Aliens or the T-Rex in Jurassic Park, and was created by the late, great, Stan Winston and his creature studio (he created the others mentioned, also). It is among some of the most convincing monsters ever created using physical effects, including those in Alien, An American Werewolf in London and Predator.The film is directed by Peter Hyams, who has made some great 'popcorn movies' over the past thirty years, including thrillers (Capricorn One, Narrow Margin, The Presidio), science-fiction (Outland, 2010 The Year We Make Contact, Timecop), and action (Sudden Death, End of Days). He is also a cinematographer, screenwriter and producer, with his own distinct lighting style. It is rare to see a film made this way nowadays, with heavy use of smoke, anamorphic lenses, and subdued, almost film-noir lighting. Since so much is in shadow, many details are lost on DVD, because the format lacks sufficient resolution. The results would be far better in High Definition (on Blu-Ray disk, for example), or on the big screen, as intended by the director.The writing is solid and well-paced. Dialogue is snappy and never reveals too much, too soon. The cast is perfect, with some memorable supporting players among them. The score, by composer John Debney, works very well, adding greatly to the atmosphere of the film. The setting, The Chicago Museum of Natural History, is a major character in the film, and is used to full effect.Movies of this kind, which combine a well-developed plot with humor, big production values and a cast of adults (not just teens with adults for support) are rare nowadays, sadly. The Relic is an underrated film that deserves to be seen by fans of the 'monster movie', or 'creature-feature' genre.

Although it isn't a terrific movie, It has several strengths. Firstly, it is atmospheric and quite suspenseful, both of which are generated by Hyam's exceptional photography skills (he is his own DP). Secondly, it is convincing as a monster movie, even with a slightly limited budget, the creature works well both as an animatronic and as a GG model. With many films, it is one or the other. Thirdly, although the story is not that original, it does a fairly good job of hiding the clich√©. The Relic paces itself nicely, putting the pieces together one at a time getting more and more interesting until it is ready to unleash its energy.It begins in the tropics of Brazil. Antropologist Dr. John Whitney works for the Chicago Natural History Museum, which is about to open an expensive new exhibit. They are very busy, so when Whitney's latest shipment of findings arrive, the crates are put aside for the moment. One scientist however Dr. Margo Green becomes intrigued with the packing leaves in the crates. They appear to contain a bizarre animal protein. Meanwhile on the other side of the city, Lt. Vincent D'Agosta of the Chicago PD is investigating a mass homicide. The crew of the cargo ship on which Dr. Whitney's crates were sent are all dead and in pieces. his search for answers takes him to the Museum. After a night guard is discovered dead and decapitated in the basement level, D'Augusta is convinced that the perp is hiding somewhere within the building. Is he right?, and will he be able to convince the museum to close on the night of their big gala opening? In addition, do all these gruesome murders have something to do with the protein that Dr. Green has discovered, a protein that can turn an insect into the size of a football! It is going to be one heck of a night, and it is up to Dr. Green and Leutenat D'Agosta to save the day.If I were to write a paper on cinematography, I would for sure make the Relic one of my body points. Peter Hyams builds a very dark, frequently claustrophobic environment, and many of his tricks work perfectly. One of which is his decision to shoot the monster mostly in silhouette to avoid the chance of it looking fake. Of course there are some area where the film is not so strong. I wouldn't say that the film offers intelligent acting or dialogue, but in truth, not many B-movies do, so if you are like me, you will let it slip and enjoy the film for what it is, a deliciously eerie, and slick monster flick.

After I finished watching the movie I was not in the least bit entertained, in fact numerous times I found myself peeping at my watch and pausing the DVD to get something to eat. The main problem with The Relic is it fails to really captivate the audience; the people I watched it with really were not focusing the least bit, even when the creature was rampaging around killing people in rather surprising ways.Now The Relic essentially concerns a strange monster that has appeared in the Museum of Natural History in Chicago. The creature then roams around the premise after night killing people and eating their brains (in particular there pituitary glands and their hypothalamus). Initially the museum staff and the local police force assume the creature originated from crates in South America that contained some unusual fungus loaded with animal hormones. What happens is anything that eats the fungus receives massive doses of the hormones, and it rebounds along the evolutionary tree and creates a monster, which is what we see in the movie. Sounds good- but be surprised, the film contains no elements that even make a creature feature worthy of viewing, just for fun.The flaws of the film begin with the science. What I have noticed that is becoming more and more common in movies, is for film makers to attempt to make a rather unintelligent film seem smart; by loading it with scientific terms and theories. Most people will actually sit back and admire this, as is science lover I simply can't. Now we are lead to believe that overdoses of hormones generate changes in an organism. Sounds OK but no it's actually quite flawed. First of all the film claims through the plot that ingesting large amounts of hormones can physically change a persons DNA, and turn them into another creature, this could not be further from the truth. For example; say if a creature like a human drinks some dog hormones; he\she will feel quite sick but will not mutate in anyway into a dog, no matter after how long. This is because at a cellular level the human lacks mechanisms to respond to it. This not so obvious flaw makes the film to me, seem really unintelligent. All right enough with the science.Now the science is really not the biggest problem, the film also suffers from quite bad CGI. Now one thing that bugs me with horror movies is; computer generated monsters. The problem with this is CGI often in these cases is poor, and it often distracts from any horror the director is trying to express. Think Jaws and Alien they had no CGI (yes I know it was not available at the time, but this is still a valid point) yet they were scary. You know why? Because everything happened on the set when they were filming, hence the actors could respond to the creature, and the creatures looked farm more real then CGI counterparts of a modern day era in film-making. Like most modern day horror films The Relic fits this new age perspective, for the worst. What we are left with an un-scary creature that looks laughable.Perhaps the most striking flaw of The Relic is its non-coherent structure. The film lacks a distinct narrative ark, this makes the film seem awkward and uncoordinated to watch. The film starts of well all the important characters are introduced adequately, and so is the creature. But suddenly, almost randomly the creature appears in mass about say an hour in and the conclusion happens. The flaw is the fact that it really lacks the suspense to build up to the finale. This assists the film in really achieving nothing more than annoying viewers, especially very critical individuals. After all perhaps the easiest way to make a film flow and seem authentic is to have this narrative ark. A film which has the negative ark enables the audience to look forward to a conclusion of the film, and not as I have said before become frustrated and bored.One final striking flaw of The Relic is the creature design. The creature looks rather awful. It seems as if someone just cut pictures out of National Geographic, glued them together and computerized it. Now the creature appears to be a large lizard, with a horses mane down its back, claws from a bird and finally a face that looks distinctly similar to a Predator (from the Predator franchise) and to top it of; an extendable snake tongue. Yikes, yeah that's pretty creative isn't it; gluing some animals together and attempting to pass it off as a visual treat.Overall The Relic will definitely go down in history literally as a relic, and not as a good film, nor a good creature-feature. Poor creature design, and incoherent story disguised by poor science make the film fail on many levels with the only slightly redeemable characteristic being the occasionally striking deaths and gore- if that fancy's your taste. The Relic scores a 2.9/10 in my books. While the film does posses some gore, it never becomes overly disturbing so any children 13 and over should be fine viewing it.

It is not a great movie, nor it is an awful one either. It could have been better if it had more of a personality, but that is where Peter Hyams fails to step in. Hyams is not much of an auteur when it comes to filmmaking. He usually creates forgettable movies such as Sudden Death, Timecop and 2010, which are not REALLY bad, but unfortunately not good either. His movies are characterized by mediocrity and lack of passion, as many movies with hired directors are. All that was good in Outland seems to be lost in him now.The movie is the definition of predictable, maybe if it had come out some fifteen years before it would have made and impact, but now all movies of this type are the same. The characters are typical and the dialogue is way too scripted. The story did seem to be original, but at the end it works out as any monster loose in a closed/survival film.It does have action and does in a way entertain the audience. It is a great movie to rent whenever there isn't anything else or to watch on cable when you are bored.Hyams could be a great director if he only showed some interest in his work, and he shows potential as making higher standard films.In a low standard film scale, I would give this movie a 6/10.

The monster roams chiefly around two places, the museum's main hall or in a deep sub-basement with miles of dim tunnels.

The idea was inventive, and its not everyday a monster flick has deaths by decapitation so the monster can feed off the hypothalamus.  The problem is the suspense does not keep you captivated, so it ends up being just a run of the mill, standard, by the numbers body count.  The actors seem to be trying so hard to make it work, but fail on most accounts, quite possibly  because of the clunky incredibly obvious and predictable dialogue that they mutter.  Of course you have your slimy research grant hogging scientist who gets what he deserves, but even then, couldn't they have done more with that.  Audiences love to see the bad guy suffer.  There is also the bumbling policeman, who for once takes control of the situation, but we dont even get to see his pride.  It is almost like the film makers decided that they didn't want to be corny so they down played a lot of bits which obviously could have been camped up.  The end result is an absolute mess as the picture tries to take itself seriously when its foundations lie more in the all out horror, comedy, action of such films as Godzilla (1998) and Independence Day.  Being Chicago it was nice to see that the picture did have a multi-cultural feel, the mixed cast was a great addition.  Watch it and wonder what could have been.

Tough cop Lt.

Top notch effects also add immensely to the overall enjoyment factor designed by Stan Winston, the creature is an impressive creation brought to life with practical models and limited use of CGI (which still holds up pretty well), and, once the film kicks into top gear, the gore is graphic and frequent, not a lot of time going by without someone having their head ripped from their body.

The cast is above average, the music appropriate, the atmosphere respectable, and the effects - a combination of practical and digital - are generally well done. Those familiar with the source novel by Douglas Preston and Lincoln Child could understandably be disappointed, especially with the elimination of some of the best characters, such as Smithback the reporter and Prendergast the FBI agent. But The Relic does kill time easily enough, and should be adequately entertaining for creature feature junkies.The description Alien in a museum is apt, as the story deals with an enormous, continuously evolving form of life that makes its home in the bowels of the Natural History Museum in Chicago. Of course, this is bad timing, as the museum is about to launch an all- important exhibit designed to pull in investors. The hero on the case is superstitious police detective Vincent D'Agosta (Tom Sizemore), who's assisted by sexy researcher Margo Green (Penelope Ann Miller).Sizemore is engaging in one of his earliest lead roles; Miller is likewise quite appealing. The supporting cast includes such familiar and reliable actors as Linda Hunt, James Whitmore, Clayton Rohner, Robert Lesser, Lewis Van Bergen, Constance Towers, Francis X. McCarthy, Audra Lindley, John Kapelos, Tico Wells, Gene Davis, John DiSanti, David Proval, Eddie Jemison, and Don Harvey. Director Peter Hyams shot the movie himself, but unfortunately he tends to under light scenes too much of the time. Action scenes are not always that coherent. But once the lights go out, things do start to get genuinely spooky and exciting. The monster design is courtesy of Stan Winston and studio, and they do their usual bang-up job.Good fun overall.Seven out of 10.

Of course, it unleashes a horror that brings death and destruction. There is a lot of the jump out of the shadows stuff, but the special effects aren't bad and it is pretty engaging.

One was -- How did the boat dock itself if everyone was dead on-board? There was a comment in the movie that the boat was found foundering in Lake Michigan, and it was brought to the dock, and that it came through the Seaway. I assume they mean the St. Lawrence Seaway, from the Atlantic Ocean to the Great Lakes. To founder in nautical terms can mean to sink, perhaps after hitting a reef or getting caught in heavy surf. Of course, we, the audience, know (or soon will know) that the relic was involved. The dock was located near a tunnel that was used for coal in the past, and it went near or under the museum. So it seems that there was some effort to close that plot hole. Perhaps they meant the boat was found drifting dead in the water. It could never get through the Seaway like that, so the deaths would have mostly been in Lake Michigan. It echos the Dracula movie, where the boat carrying his coffin is blown by a great storm to the English coast, with almost all hands dead, and with the helmsman lashed to the wheel. But that implied an evil force guiding the doomed ship. The boat in the Relic could have been towed to any number of ports. The was no real reason that it would end up near the museum, so that the native tribe would get its revenge. Which still leaves the question of what did the researcher do to annoy that tribe so much?

Vincent D'Agosta (Sizemore) and evolutionary biologist Dr. Margo Green (Miller) get to the bottom of the mystery before it's too late?.One from the bunch of creature feature movies that surfaced in the 1990s, The Relic may not win prizes for originality of plotting, but it scores high for tension and gloopy fun. Tho the decent budget is evident ($70,000,000), the film has all the old fashioned values to make a creature feature work. Rank and file staples come thick and fast; boo jump moments, characters refusing to accept the un-normal, silly kids, silly coppers, a potential hero and heroine, possible romance, some sci-fi babble, a curse, and of course the creature itself; a big hybrid of god knows what! But the Kothoga is a snarling, slimy monstrosity that goes about the museum lopping heads off inept human beings with carefree abandon. What's not to like there?.Tho Hyams is no genius director, he is, as his CV suggests, more than capable at crafting a polished movie. Such is the case here. Where the B movie story is given good technical treatment. The lighting and editing serve the atmosphere well, while the sound work is of the required horror requisitional standard. More importantly, tho, Hyams is aware of building up the tension by not unleashing the creature too soon. We know it's the killer, and we get little snippets of it here and there, but it's not until all hell breaks loose at the big museum event that we see the monster, and it's not a let down. Part animatronic/part computer effect, the Kothoga is original and it is great fun. So much so it (thankfully) steers the viewers away from the pedestrian performances of the cast. Not bad exactly, but just doing grizzled and spunky beauty (Sizemore & Miller respectively) doesn't grab the attention. The best actor on show is Whitmore (tracing a lovely creature feature line from Them! in 1954 to here), but he is badly under written and under used.Still, the minor acting issues matters not, for this is ready made for a Saturday night in with the beer and some snacks.

It is fast-paced, and things don't take forever to happen. They just happen so fast! For what the special effects technology lacked in those days, the actual murder scenes showing the remains of dead persons (and there aren't that many in this movie) are not realistic or scary. Instead, most of the murders are shown as suggestions of what gruesome stuff might have happened to the victims - loads of blood splattering about, the look of terror on their faces before they met their maker, the frantic but failed attempts to escape, etc. - those scenes were what made the movie more realistic and gory. Also I stayed on to the end because the main characters were interesting to watch - they all had like very distinct, strong personalities - not always likable or pleasant people, but a bit eccentric, quirky, rude, irritating at times. And there is a bit of mystery about what that horrible thing really is and what caused it to be that way... and you'll know if you watch till the end.

Yes, in such an old-fashioned way, but it is the sort of darker luxury, like a turtle or crab within its shell, this film can provide the centerpiece for, just as comedies and action films have their places in other senses of human luxury. The Relic is the sort of horror film that can give me that comfort, but it pushes it. It is as thin as the icing on a cake, nothing more than a movie about a monster in a museum with different assembly line characters having to fight their way out.It's a fun movie, so don't get me wrong. However, it's specifically designed for us to feel passive towards it, as we catch a flick with some friends on a Friday night and then leave for a party, forgetting all about it or we flip through channels late at night and decide to stick with it, only to fall asleep and wake up the next day with no clear recollection of it. I want to say it's strenuously designed for just that kind of attitude towards movie-going, but strenuous implies that anything impassioned was existent during the process of writing or making the movie at all. When I leave a movie, I like to talk about the characters, performances, different scenes, and things like that that one could usually pick out of a movie because a director normally wants certain things to stand out with significance. The Relic is skids so lightly along the surface of light movie entertainment that there's hardly anything to pick out. I could talk about Tom Sizemore's character, the tough-as-nails hero cop, about how his being obsessively superstitious and how his heartbreak and anger over the fact that he lost custody of his dog in a divorce both make him very endearing and likable, especially the latter, but it wouldn't mean much because those qualities are only decoration, which is just the case with Penelope Ann Miller's assertive and ambitious young graduate student working at the museum, who seethes with anger at a colleague who is clearly stabbing her in the back for a grant. These expository details are not scaffolding for the story as exposition and character development are supposed to be, because they do not color the characters in ways that affect their actions dealing with the focal driver of the story, which is the monster.The cinematography is too dark, the dialogue feels a little on the scripted side, the score is only score rather than pounding musical steering. These flaws here, however, I will excuse, because frankly I have to. It's so inextricably and intentionally the fluff type of movie that excusing flaws comes with the territory.

The film is characterized by dim lighting in dark passageways, interiors and murky waterways, with only a flashlight used to guide the trapped patrons in their flight from terror. The plot uses the usual genre staples of sudden shock scenes and over-the-top gore to make its point. James Whitmore and Linda are especially good in supporting roles. Miller is a good heroine who winds up in a gripping chase scene with the monster in the picture's home stretch. The music score and low-key lighting add the film's dark, menacing atmosphere.

An investigation reveals that the crew has been decapitated. In the cargo hold, a mysterious box from South America has a final destination of Chicago itself, the Natural History Museum. The box is delivered to Dr. Margo Green. (Penelope Ann Miller) The box contains several artifacts from a South American tribe that was thought to be extinct. The box also contained a special leaf that is beyond the understanding of the museum authorities. A security guard is gruesomely killed that same night, decapitated. Police Officer Vincent D'Agosta (Tom Sizemore) orders the museum closed until investigations can ensue, but is overruled due to a new exhibit opening the next day that traces the evolution of superstition. Knowing there is a monster inside the museum, an investigation shows why the monster decapitates people it feasts on a special gland found only in the human brain. The red carpet reception is going smoothly until a monster arrives, attacking the police officers that are combing the tombs of the museum to find the answer to the mystery. After numerous attacks, D'Agosta and Green manage to trap and kill the creature inside the museum, and learn that the monster is a combination of the leaf, an insect, and the scientist who sent the crate in the first place.    The Good News Being a monster movie, the main thing that comes to mind is gore, which this film provides a great quantity of. The quality is also good, as most of the severed heads look realistic. As another reviewer mentioned, the creature itself is completely realistic, and Winston should have gone home with the Oscar. In all of it's scenes when we finally see the beast, he looks impressive. I have read the novel that inspired this movie, and I thought the movie is better. The novel was all right, but I could never get into it the way I got into the movie. It hooks you fast and never seems to let go, as the filler scenes fit the movie perfectly, adding back history or explanations for the creature. Aside from Miller, though, the acting is horrible. She is the lone bright star in acting, and turns in a credible performance. The main thing that won this movie over for me, though, was the judicious use of suspense. I don't care how good a horror film is, without suspense, it has to work twice as hard to win me over. There are several quite good examples. The first is the killing of the security guard. He is killed inside a urinal. As he walks in and sits down, he goes into his pocket and pulls out a joint. Opening a window to blow the smoke out, he lights it up and takes a puff. A strange noise gets his attention. He stops and calls a couple of times for the thing to show itself. Ignoring it, he continues to puff away. The creature takes the cue and pulls his leg out and him into another stall, never to be seen again. What makes the scene great is that it takes about a minute to fully go through, from his wandering in to his demise. The timing is remarkable, as the final cut down to his leg mere milliseconds before the lizard hand juts forth is a fantastic payoff. The second best example is towards the end of the movie. D'Agosta and Green are moving through a flooded sewer tracking the creature. They wade through for quite some time before reaching a sewer grate. Attacking a piece of meat to the grate, D'Agosta backs away, expecting the creature to appear on the other side of the grate. Instead the creature appears behind Green, forcing D'Agosta to fend off its attack. Unlike the first scene, this one works due to the atmosphere of the setting. Inside a dark, damp sewer is a perfect setting for something to go `boo.' However, Hyams did something unusual in that he had both Sizemore and Miller silent throughout the whole scene. This makes only the trickling water the only thing heard on the soundtrack. The final stage is the monster itself, erupting up on their side of the fence.The Bad News The movie has almost no regard for logic. How can a ship without any people driving it manage to go from South America up through the Great Lakes into a Chicago harbor? I don't know how, but in here it can. Like I said above, only Miller does a good job in the acting department. Sizemore wanders through the movie with a stone sour expression that never tends to change, even in the action sequences. He must really have needed the work or wanted to work with Miller.The Final Verdict Put aside some small suspension of disbelief, and you will find a highly enjoyable and entertaining monster flick. It works for no matter what kind of horror film fan you may be.Rated R Graphic Violence, Graphic Language, and a small scene of drug use.

There's a monster loose in the museum of natural history, a monster with a very odd habit - it rips people's heads off and devours the hormone producing gland in their brain.  A whiny female scientist and a tough guy cop try to find out who (or what) the killer is, before it can go on a rampage during a fancy gala event.The monster is really very cool.  It looks like a cross between a great cat and a tarantula, complete with mandibles and pincers.  This film also features one of screendom's first full-frontal decapitations, as the monster carefully and methodically rips the head off of a living, breathing and screaming human being.  There's a great performance here by Tom Sizemore, one of my favorite heavies.  He's crude, he's blunt, he swears too much and he's totally convincing and very likable.  Penelope Ann Miller is incredibly annoying in her role of skinny, perky scientist her character does not use good judgment, she screams and whines too much and was not very likable, redeeming herself only briefly in the films final moments when she finally grows a backbone and goes to battle with the beast, moving and thinking quickly and cleverly.  This film has a lot going for it the museum is a great setting, filled with curiosities and gross exhibitions that would not be out of place in a freak show.  There's also a great, suffocatingly scary scene in an underground tunnel, half filled with cold, murky water.  It's not a flawless film by any means, and it's not as intelligent or as engrossing as the book by authors Douglas Preston and Lincoln Child, but it's a decent monster movie with some very good special effects.

As far as the ancient idol/horrible monster/kill everyone around genre goes, its not bad at all. I enjoy Tom Sizemore as an actor and while the script was what one would expect of 4 credited (and lord knows how many uncredited) screenwriters, I felt he did a good job as his character. Honestly for a movie of this type, the acting was just fine. They weren't required to do much, but that was OK.However, if you watch this movie, get used to entire scenes where you have no idea what is happening because its so dark. I understand, keep the settings dim to create fear (and realism, the power is out most of the time though why everyone in the museum works in near total darkness 99% of the time is a bit mind-boggling) but I can't be scared if I can't see what's happening when I'm supposed to!Dark, extremely dark shots keep the viewer in the (I can't do it), keep the viewer confused in many scenes. It was bad enough that a moderate length movie (109m) seemed MUCH longer and not in a good way. Much like gimmicky camera tricks or abuse of slow-motion (I'm looking at you John Woo) can ruin a movie, the overly dark nature of so many shots just leaves you sitting there wish you could tell what the hell was going on.I will say, possibly watching it on a larger screen, or a better quality television (mine is a 32 Sony LCD, nothing fancy) might mitigate lighting issues a bit, I don't know.Overall, its an OK movie for the genre that is partially ruined by not being able to tell what the hell is going on.

Until recently I couldn't even watch it in entirety. Anyway, there's a scientist who needs some research grant and another scientist applies for it and we're supposed to dislike him. I don't know why. Perhaps we're supposed to be impressed by the protagonist being smart despite her being female, or similar dated logic. Oh and this bad scientist keeps trying to impress the grant-givers while they're in danger. Or maybe that's supposed to be for comedic value. Many more flat characters appear. Most amount to nothing but additional victims. The monster, which is of decent design whenever its face isn't shown apparently survives by eating tiny parts of human brain matter yet it certainly weighs at least around a ton.

If you liked Alien, you'll love this one, because Alien is the model from which much else is ripped off. But there are bits and pieces of Terminator too, and other sources hidden in the gloom of my preconscious.See, there is this big museum in New York and a monster has been inadvertently created out of an undocumented alien -- a Turkish gekko -- shipped in by packing crate. Maybe from Brazil. (I got a little lost.) It has something to do with tearing out the hypothalamus which, as you know, controls breathing and blood pressure. If it actually DOES that, then I've forgotten the course I took that dealt with the functions of the hypothalamus. I'd have thought it was the medulla, but I guess I'd have gotten that item wrong on the exam. The sneaky lizard also ate some magic herbs or something. They got the scientific name of the gekko right, though. It doesn't matter. Now it's grown up into a semi-lizard Ray Harryhausen creation with scales, claws, fangs, a tail, and a long, slimy forked tongue that it slips out of its maw in order to caress Penelope Anne Miller's breast and face -- the only sensible thing this mutant does in the entire movie.I won't go on about it. It's not worth much attention. The museum, unlike the Alien space ship, is large but still full of subterranean tunnels and sewers with dripping water. Most of the film takes place in the dark, maybe with a flashlight waving around. If you intend watching this because you enjoy seeing Penelope Anne Miller, Linda Hunt, or James Whitmore -- forget it. It's too dark and none of them in on screen for very long.

A Chicago museum is planning a grand event to open their new exhibit(dubbed Superstition) when a security guard is ripped apart. The police shut down the museum to conduct an investigation. After finding and killing a crazy man in the museum's basement the town Mayor decides to let the grand opening go on despite the warnings of one Lt. Vincent D'Agosta, who believes there may be a connection to the mysterious deaths aboard a cargo ship that was recently brought to port only a few miles away. With the help of evolutionary biologist Margo Green, his suspicion is confirmed. It seems the ship was carrying a pair of crates from Brazil, sent to the museum by anthropologist John Whitney. D'Agosta and Green make this discovery a bit late; the gala has begun and there's something lurking in the coal tunnels beneath the museum.That sounds like a recipe for a decent, derivative monster movie, doesn't it? Unfortunately, it doesn't work for one main reason, and his name is Peter Hyams. While a competent director, Hyams will most times act as his own DP(director of photography), and therein lies the problem. He seems to think that keeping the lights as low as possible is an acceptable way to build tension. It's one thing to use dim lighting on a film(shadows can be very effective), but entirely another to keep the lighting so minimal as to eliminate shadow detail. The Relic isn't dark, it's black. There are no shadows; outside of direct light there is no detail whatsoever. Even scenes set inside the museum offices are too dim(and that's before the electricity has been cut). There are too many scenes where, despite there being several people in frame, the only things you can see are the flashlights they're holding. I could go on about this forever, but you get the idea. All this darkness is a real shame, too, because the always reliable Stan Winston has created another terrific monster. Note to producers stop allowing Hyams to be his own DP!On the other hand, there's the story. The opening attempts to pass on some information about Whitney and how exactly the creature gets to the museum. Throughout the film there are more pieces of the puzzle, but only enough to figure out what happened, not why. Evidently, the novel supplied a reason for the tribe's(in the opening sequence) actions, but all you can deduce from the film is that Whitney was simply participating in the ritual for the purpose of research. From what little I've heard about the novel, they had an ulterior motive.To be fair, the film does have some good scenes(even if you can't see much of what's happening). The effects during the final chase are superb, as is the creature in general(again, what you can see of it).Overall, there's not much to be attracted to in The Relic. I've always found films like this to be better when the sets, characters, monsters, and mutilations thereof are visible. So, if you're in the mood for an old-fashioned, gory, B-grade monster movie I recommend trying its 1999 counterpart, Virus. There's little worth watching here.

Anyway, I was intrigued to know what other IMDb users made of it, since I think it just might be the worst film ever made.  Having read many of the users' comments, I was amazed to find that a fair few viewers seem somewhat confused and I felt compelled to address this issue. One clich√© that is often trotted out by reviewers is 'check your brain in at the door and you'll enjoy it'.  Why do people say this?  I like my brain thank you very much!  Without it I couldn't get the pop corn to my mouth, right?  I wouldn't know which way to face to watch the movie, yes?  I think these people say this because *they* liked the movie, then listened to 'all that intellectual stuff' that the 'film snobs' were going on about (little things like demanding that the DP knows where the 'on' switch is), and then come to the conclusion that if only people just didn't have to go and try *thinking* about things all the time, everyone would like it.  Ouch!  No, DON'T listen to those who don't have brains *to* check in.  Be proud that *you* haven't got your jumper on back-to-front, and don't have L and R on your shoes and see this film for what it really is RUBBISH.  ' The fact that it's very dark only adds to the atmosphere' was one fascinating comment.  By that logic, the darker it is (and thus the less one can see of the film) the better it gets - hey!  You know what?  You're right! Switch it off completely - now that *is* better!  'One great thing about it is that they knew where and how to end it' another said.  Thank God they did, I thought, because I was in agony waiting for it to end.  'It had the potential of being so much better' - how could it not?  This is as bad as movie making gets; anything - ANYTHING - would be better than this. 'I am not a big fan of these types of movies (What, bad ones?  No me either), but I have to say I was reasonably entertained' - PLEASE! The film's intro is totally unexplained and superfluous.  What were the writers thinking of?  Couldn't they tell that these scenes were inexplicable?  Don't they understand that when an audience sees something mysterious happening, they wonder about it, and then expect an explanation? Haven't the writers ever been into a museum?  Who *are* these people, that they think the high levels of security they have in their museum won't seem ridiculous to those who have been to real museums?  Why didn't the actors question their preposterous lines?  Linda Hunt has won an Oscar for crying out loud (but then again, did she win for her acting or merely for 'being'?).  *Six months* to 'prepare'  an exhibit (what needs to be done exactly?); and look at the awful end product too!  The only reason I could imagine for it taking so long to prepare was that they had employed idiots to do it - probably checked their brains in at the door each morning.  Did the writers seriously think that audiences wouldn't think the museum's basement was a little extraordinary?  The Relic seems to have been made by people without any concept of reality, unable to even *mimic* a decent film. The dialogue is equivalent to The Bold and the Beautiful - only a child would be unable to tell that real people don't say such things or in such ways. The monster itself defies description (but doesn't *deserve* describing); that Stan Winston made it should illustrate that being able to handle the technicalities of model making (or any aspect of filmmaking) in no way guarantees a good sense of aesthetics.  It is the director who guides the artistic vision of a movie and Winston's best work has been for Lucas and Spielberg.  Talk about CG-itis - this monster was so obviously computer generated that it totally failed to convince that it was actually present. 'Hey look - we've got a computer program that lets us make SFX - let's knock something up in a few days and hope that it stands up against Jurassic Park's effects'; technicians (not artists), who think that saving time and money justifies such pathetic results.  Why not just have a man in a suit; it would have been cheaper still and just as *bad*.  In seriousness, think for a moment how much that film probably cost.  Imagine how much was spent just making the prints for distribution to cinemas across the country; on posters and television and radio air time marketing it.  We are talking *millions* of dollars here - MILLIONS.   How would you feel if you had helped to finance The Relic?  Knowing that one in ten films ever makes a profit, would you gamble your money on this?  NO YOU WOULDN'T.  So don't you think the people responsible ought to try to make *good* films, that is, ones that at least have a chance of getting the production costs back? NOT use cheap and quick methods that are patently bad?  Oh well, if you thought The Relic was good - was worth *paying* to watch - then 'they' will keep on making them. Rating 0 stars (without merit); without question, one of the worst films ever made.

This entity makes its way into Chicago's museum along with other crates.Mysterious killing is seen on the ship that carried cargos from South America. The killing continues at the museum in Chicago. Soon it becomes clear that they have a predator on their hands. The predator has eaten a special leave that grows in South America, and is evolving on its own while eating away all the people it comes in contact with.It's one of those movies that thing happens mostly in the dark, and you don't see the monster. I don't like movies of this type, because you don't see much of the monster, but end up seeing mostly people who are frightened all through the movie. You get left with a feeling that you've been gipped in the end. This movie isn't so bad as some of the other movies of this type as you do see the monster occasionally in full view, but still its exposure is very limited.Since the monster is evolving, its really not a relic but a new specie. I expected better, but this movie couldn't overcome the hurdle this type of horror movie has - namely you're just watching scared people and that just about sums the whole movie.

The labyrinthine exhibits and massive storage areas shape a pervasive sense of claustrophobia throughout the film, and as we explore the chambers of this vast institution, there's never any doubt that the creature could be lurking anywhere.Tom Sizemore doesn't need to do much to make his hardened detective come to life, but his role strikes the right balance between clever and clich√©. This makes it easy to forgive that some of his dialogue is straight out of Police Drama 101, like his observation that the mysterious creature makes Jeffrey Dahmer look like a cub scout. Likewise, Penelope Ann Miller proves to be a plucky and sensible heroine, and its easy to root for the duo as they uncover the hidden truths of the titular Relic and face the monster in their midst. The rest of the cast is rounded out by a slew of recognizable character actors, and what strikes me most about the ensemble is that the majority of the supporting players in the film are actually likable (except for the ones who clearly aren't supposed to be, whom we can't wait to see get slaughtered). This dramatically heightens the tension, since we find ourselves invested in what happens to the unlucky souls who unwittingly find themselves in the monster's path. We don't often get a group of characters this thoughtfully essayed in the horror genre, so kudos to the film-makers for not simply trotting out a series of nameless victims to pad the body count.Some of the plot elements are iffy at best, and since the film runs a bit on the long side anyway, the ineffectual red herring is a diversion that could have easily been snipped away. Throwing in a homeless ex-rapist who lives in the basement of the museum is a dicey move, especially when said ex-rapist is set up to take the fall for the monster's killing spree. It's never explained exactly how the damning evidence was transferred to this unlikely suspect, so this time-filler ends up being more confusing than challenging.Ditto with the extended sequences which reveal a series of underground tunnels running from the Chicago waterfront to the basement of the museum (?). While this sets up some truly harrowing action inside the creature's lair, this revelation adds a head-scratching dimension to a film which already expects us to suspend our disbelief often enough.Of course, the most important factor in a monster movie is the monster itself. In that regard, it's not surprising that Stan Winston's creature effects are excellent, and despite the often murky lighting, we get a pretty good sense of our beast by the time the final credits roll. While certainly not the crowing achievement on Winston's legendary resume, The Relic's fearsome leviathan is a gruesome and well-realized creation, even if he does display a repetitive obsession with decapitation that dilutes some of the gorier sequences by sheer familiarity.Boasting loads of action, a nifty monster, and plenty of red sauce to please splatter aficionados, The Relic has all of the ingredients for a splendid horror film. Despite its flaws, the film works very well and certainly doesn't deserve to languish in obscurity. Give this one another look. "},{"Title":"Scary?

I couldn't quite understand why blood stained leaves and funny smelling carpets were signals for imminent death by gruesome murder, and it was overdosed with clich√©s (scary monster is let loose in an enclosed space, signalling death to all).The children that feature were quite funny (as in ha ha funny, not this-is-so-unscary-it's funny), and the final chase scene with the explosions was quite well done for such an old film.The credits were amazingly long, and despite being done a million times before and since, what I saw of it (I was only watching it on and off) was alright, but more served the purpose of making me laugh rather than making me shake.In 1997 - scary. In 2007 - not so much.

It instead tries to be very gory at moments and all of the characters are fun and slightly comical like. Seemed like the movie was almost trying to be a parody of the genre, I guess this was done intentional and it also works out pleasant. It doesn't make The Relic a big heavy serious movie to watch but an enjoyable easy one for in between instead. Nothing beats a big bad monster chopping off museum-guest heads and eating up their brains.The movie is filled with a couple of good moments and the right sort of dark atmosphere but just when the movie heats up, it's already over again. The ending comes too abrupt and therefor the eventual movie as a whole leaves a sort of a bitter aftertaste and an unsatisfying impression.Seemed like they were influenced a bit too much by Jurassic Park. Some sequences and even camera-angles are just a bit too similar. Further more the movie also shows one or two similarities to the Alien-movies but then again, which modern monster movie doesn't?I must say, Tom Sizemore was great in his role. It was also one of his first big roles, that got Hollywood's attention and his career started to take really off, before he himself destroyed it singlehandedly again a couple of years ago, by drugs and appearing in his own shot porn adventures. I couldn't care less about the Penelope Ann Miller character. The rest of the supporting cast is mostly put in the movie for the fun of it and to fill up the screen, with fine actors such as Linda Hunt and James Whitmore.Watchable for the fans of modern, 'big budget' B-horror. If you liked movies such as Mimic, Species, Alien Resurrection, chances are you'll probably also end up liking this movie.5/10http//bobafett1138.blogspot.com/ "},{"Title":"a story with little substance supposedly compensated by special effects and a dark cinematography","Date":"27 August 2006","Score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Horror, Mystery, Sci-Fi","Review":" Peter Hyams's career followed an indisputable downswing in the nineties during which he came to direct mediocre vehicles for Jean Claude Van Damme such as Timecop (1994), Sudden Death (1995) or for Arnold Schwarzenegger with the ludicrous End of Days (1999). It's all the more dismaying as he signed ambitious works a long time ago like Capricorn One (1978) or Star Chamber (1983). The difference of quality between them and the recent efforts is glaring.The Relic finds itself between Sudden Death and End of Days and if it's a little more palatable and watchable than these two turkeys, it's far from being a classy B movie. A horrendous creature haunts a museum in search of human brain to keep its vitality and its strength. Visibly influenced by the Alien saga and Die Hard, the plot follows an ultra-mapped, stale scheme with archetypal characters like the young, ambitious scientist (Penelop Ann Miller) or the steady cop (Tom Sizemore). Do you realize it required 6 scenarists to pen it? It is very plagued in its second half when all the guests are in the museum because of an incessant and eventually irritating use of a dark cinematography applied to the scenery of the museum. Hyams is also responsible of the cinematography and if this method is in itself commendable to make his film chilly, it also hampers it in the sense that very often we can't see properly what's going on on the screen. It could lead to some plot holes or irregularities.The film couldn't be complete without indispensable special effects which aren't too intrusive, except in the end. The monster is as credible as spooky and these qualities redeem a little this little, reheated product. But you'd better watch again or discover Hyams' works produced at the end of the seventies or at the dawn of the eighties to realize his true potential as a filmmaker.

Inside policemen find the body parts of what use to be some of the crew. Meanwhile crates belonging to a scientist doing research in Brazil that were suppose to be on the freighter arrive at a museum in Chicago that is about to have its Gala opening of its Superstitious artifact collection. Soon after, museum employees turn up with their heads cut off. It appears something has come back on the Ocean freighter looking for the crates. Now its up to a superstitious cop investigating the murders and a pretty scientist trying to get a grant for her work to figure out just what horrifying thing is cutting peoples heads off at the museum. Thats the plot in a nutshell and throw in your typical characters; A rude Mayor and his buxom wife, a somewhat rookie partner who in the end proves himself, a krusty old scientist, an annoying co-worker who spends most of their time trying to back stab, a dumb ass pompous policeman who thinks he knows everything, and of course the old over the top CGI creature and you have a recipe for a good cheesy horror flick. This one is saved by a few cool decapitations and the likability of its lead actress. The fact that the Cop in charge is superstitious and lives his life by these rules is a quirky change of pace. Although none of this is really new stuff, and aside from the unexplained abrupt and entrances and exits of certain characters your left wondering about, the film itself is not too bad if you got some time to kill. The wonderful Audra Lindley who most will remember as the over sexed and under satisfied Mrs. Roeper of Three's Company fame has too little screen time ( about five minutes, if that )and I would have loved to have seen more of her character in the film. She plays a witty and sassy coroner who steals the entire scene she is in. I suspect her scenes were highly edited. Probably because she would have stolen the whole movie from the other actors. Now Linda Hunt is the odd one cast here but plays her part very well and finally shows us where the inspiration for the character of the pat like midget stylist from The Incredibles came from (I forget the character's name). So sit back and pop some pop corn and and enjoy this head popping entry.

Hyams has helmed a film which delivers the goods with a creature which resembles an ancient monster of Brazalian myth. Miller is the evolutionary biologist who finds that something is not quite right with some kind of mineral(which covered Brazilian leaves and looks a bit like berries)and learns that this is a major source in what caused a beetle to become QUITE large. Miller desires(along with Linda Hunt playing the museum curator)funding for her research and operations. Chi Muoi Lo plays a sleazy butt kisser who desires the grant money as well to seek his own employment and escape being under the leadership of Miller. Tom Sizemore plays a superstitious detective trying to uncover the deaths of fisherman whose ship was found operation-less on the shore. They were killed by something which removed the hypothalamus from their brains. The museum(set in Chicago as a Natural Arts Museum)soon starts to become a killing grounds as well when we see a security guard get killed right in the middle of smoking a joint. Sizemore soon loses officers as they seek out under the tunnels of Chicago(which would be an accurate place for the killer to travel)the responsible killer. Soon Sizemore and Miller become acquainted as he tries to figure out how the security guard(whose death resembles the dead shipping crew)and the shipping crews deaths are linked. Meanwhile, the museum is setting up a great gala which will feature many prominent members of Chicago society such as the mayor and grant suppliers. Sizemore has his hands full with pressure to allow them to open the museum up despite knowing that it's possible the killer is still present. He decides to allow the top floor open as he searches down below to find the killer. Soon, Sizemore discovers(as we do)that the killer responsible is a giant monster. The screenplay writers make very sure that many will perish as this museum is so elaborate it has a grid security package which locks down steel doors and lights when something appears to go wrong. What no one is in store for is a creature which tears the system to shreds causing the whole museum to lock down trapping many inside. Soon, many will become tasty morsels to the huge monster and somehow Miller & Sizemore must stop it. The film is expertly photographed in shades of dark only allowing us to see a little. He creates a creepy atmosphere here with a museum which has many corners and a monster which explodes from the darkness with much fury. Stan Winston's monster effects are outstanding and the film provides many well made gore effects. It's a thrill ride and moves at rapid speed. The film tries to provide scientific jargon to explain how such a monster could exist(or provides insight into the DNA and reasons behind how the monster exists)into the mouth of Miller. Whitmore has a good supporting role as Miller's confidant and elder statesman.

The only pleasant surprise is that there are some decent actors to be found paying the bills by sheepishly showing their faces. It's not nearly enough to save the film as a whole though, since they ARE outnumbered, and the direction and script can best be described as amateurish. This is for Tom Sizemore what Species was to Michael Madsen; although Species had the redeeming factors of a few decent one liners and Natasha Henstridge in the buff an awful lot. The Relic in a nutshell is Alien in a museum, but with about a hundredth of the imagination or flair that one could expect if they'd got Ridley Scott to direct and hired some decent writers. As it is, we get stuck with 'hack' director Hyams and clich√©s/dumb dialogue aplentyThe script really is unbelievably poor. Space and time are wasted in order to explain things that should be self evident to those of average I.Q and above. Prime example What's that? It's blood... WE KNOW IT'S BLOOD, WE WORKED THAT OUT BEFORE YOU DID! On reflection, such repetition is probably a useful thing, since it means you can fall asleep and not actually miss anything. Director Hyams even helps to create a soporific atmosphere by making things on screen every bit as dark as the surroundings in which you'll probably watch the movie. No, darkness won't help to increase the scare factor; but it WILL make it more difficult for you to look at your watch...How this ever got a cinema release is beyond me. It bears all the hallmarks of a straight-to-video effort.

Both of the characters have absolutely no depth and do not evolve through the movie. There are also the horrible special effects and computer animations to be mentioned. You would say that two years after Jurassic Park(a breakthrough in the computer animation industry), it would be possible to create a convincing monster in a movie, especially if you can keep him in the dark and the rain most of the time. But unfortunately this doesn't seem to be possible for the computer animation crew of 'The Relic'.Another problem is the way the director keeps killing the tension in the movie by constantly switching between the chase scenes within the museum and the(completely useless) scenes outside the museum(people cutting through doors, etc.)  Conclusion This movie is definitely one of the worst movies I have seen in a long time.

But The Relic does have a sort of charm to itself, maybe because of the scientific aspect. Portraying something brought from South America to a Chicago museum and going on a rampage, there's mostly little that we haven't seen before, but the movie pulls an interesting trick by saving most of the action until later. And when the action arrives, they pull no punches. Maybe the movie is warning us about the dangers of messing with nature, but it mostly appears to be an excuse to have fun. And some of the scenes just might tense you up.So, even if the flick has some plot holes and clich√©s (a sultry female scientist, a tough cop, and a crotchety old guy), the cool twists and turns make up for that.

An anthropologist named John Whitney (Lewis Van Bergen) is there studying tribes and their rituals. He discovers something horrific. Captain Borne (Santos Morales) is ready to set sail the Santos Morales (they named the ship after the actor playing the Captain it would appear) when John Whitney confronts him and asks to have his crates unloaded that are destined for the Chicago Natural History Museum. Borne refuses and prepares to leave. Whitney sneaks on board and heads for his crates but finds the ones he wants aren't there. In a mix up at the dock some of his crates were left behind. 'Chicago, Illinois 6 Weeks Later'. Lieutenant Vincent D'Agosta (Tom Sizemore) and Dectective Hollingsworth (Clayton Rohner) are called in to investigate a supposedly deserted ship, the Santos Morales. There is blood everywhere and in the cargo hold they discover the rotting mutilated bodies of the crew, they assume that it's a drug deal gone bad. '1 Week Later', Dr. Margot Green (Penelope Ann Miller) is an evolutionary biologist who works at the Chicago Natural History Museum. She talks with the Museums curator, Dr. Albert Frock (James Whitmore). He says that the crates from John Whitney have just arrived as there was a mix up in Brazil and were flown here, one crate contains an old tribal relic and the other crate seems to be empty apart form some leaves which have either some strange fungus or eggs on them. That night a security guard named Frederick Ford (Jophery C.Brown) is viciously attacked and killed by something. Lt. D'Agusto and Det. Collingsworth are brought in. The way in which Ford was killed and mutilated is very similar to the way the crew on the Santos Morales were, they also discover John Whitney's office has been vandalised. Lt. D'Agusto feels the cases are connected. The Museum doesn't need any bad publicity and are intending to hold a gala for the Mayor (Robert Lesser) his wife (Diane Robbin) and lots of important influential guests to try and raise funding for the museum, they try and sweep the incident under the carpet. Unfortunately Lt. D'Agusto can't stop the gala from going ahead, the bad news for the guests is that there seems to be a giant mutated creature running around that needs to eat human brains for a particular hormone it survives on. Only Lt. D'Agusto and Dr. Green seem to believe in it's existence and decide they must find a way to stop it. Directed by Peter Hyams I really rather enjoyed this old fashioned monster film brought bang up to date with the latest special effects. The script by Amy Holden Jones, John Raffo, Rick Jaffa and Amanda Silver based on a novel by Douglas Pretson and Lincoln Child is fast paced and consistently entertaining, although I thought their attempts at giving Tom Sizemore's character some personality by having a running joke about his wife getting custody of their dog and the fact he is very superstitious didn't really work. There is also supposed to be a twist at the end which I found rather pointless. There is some really good gore in this, lots of mangled bodies and decapitated heads. The special make-up effects for these scenes are great, really yucky and gory. The monster effects by Stan Winston are predictably excellent, although the monster itself isn't fully shown until the very end but it's worth the wait. I also thought the brief and thankfully restrained use of CGI effects were really good too, especially the burning monster rampaging after Penelope Ann Miller at the end. There is however one thing that I absolutely hate about this film, the cinematography by director Hyams is quite simply far too dark. You can barely see what's happening in certain scenes while others are lit so darkly that most of the image is just black, I know it's a horror film and that light and shadow play a big part in creating atmosphere but this is just plain difficult to watch and make out what's going on. I'm not sure if this is the way it's meant to be but that was all I could think about during most of it's running time and spoils the good effects work of Winston and the CGI team as you can't make any real detail out in most of the sequences the monsters in. Another less serious problem I had was the casting of both Tom Sizemore and Penelope Ann Miller who are both fine actors but are also a little bland and forgettable in their leading roles here. Overall I really enjoyed it but I found the constant darkness distracting and made the film as a whole difficult to watch at times, I would also have preferred a slightly more likable cast. Still definitely worth a watch but for me these flaws stop it from becoming a classic modern horror film that it could have been. "}{"Title":"Excellent story.

I had read the book and had always thought that it had all the elements of a great Hollywood blockbuster.Then I saw the movie.To say that I was disappointed would be an understatement of the gravest sort.  I admit, I had gone in with high expectations, and I should have expected something that was somewhat less than the book, but this barely resembled the book and it was also a horrible film in its own right.First of all, the writers of the screenplay butchered the plot with a rusty axe.  Key scenes were removed and required characters were cut (i.e. Agent Pendergast and William Smithback).  This lead to a weak plot.  The dialogue was also cut and altered badly.  Preston and Child write some of the most believable dialogue is literature, and yet, the movie interpretation was wooden and trite.  There was nothing believable or even likable about the characters, and in the end, I really couldn't care if they lived or died. I cannot blame this on the actors, because both of the stars are quite talented and have proved themselves in the past; therefore I can only blame the screenwriters and the director.Secondly, the film itself was badly created.  It was filmed in the dark, with the exception of a couple of scenes, and that is an unforgivable sin. Movies get filmed in the dark when the director wants to hide something (Event Horizon) or when the movie has little or no budget (Halloween).  In the later case, dark movies can be acceptable, because they couldn't afford the lights, but this is not the case for The Relic.  This movie was filmed in the dark because the special effects crew could not be bothered to do a decent job on the Kothoga.  A man in a rubber suit would have been more convincing than the CGI used in this movie.  If they felt that they could not create a proper creature, then they should not have tried.  There are many horror movies out there where the monster is rarely if ever seen (Jaws, The Haunting original, The Changeling), and yet these movies are just as effective for their lack of special effects.  The creators of The Relic should have considered this, before they approved a half-assed effort.Thirdly, as mentioned above, the acting was wooden and stilted.  I cannot blame Penelope Ann Miller or Tom Sizemore for this, as they are both talented actors.  However, I do have to say that both were badly cast. Miller was unbelievable as Dr. Margo Green, and Sizemore was one of the worst choices for Lt. Vincent D'Agostino.  All I can figure is that the producers felt that they could not pull off their movie without big names, so they cast the biggest names they could afford after they paid Linda Hunt's salary.All in all, this was one of the worst movies I have ever seen.  I would give it a negative rating if that were possible, but as it is not, I give it 1 star.  The one good thing about this movie is that it lost so much money and garnered such horrible reviews, that maybe Hollywood will ignore the other Preston/Child works.  I, for one, never want to see the butcher job that they would do on Ice Limit or Riptide.

So I trotted down to the local video store and got the DVD.Synopsis 'The Relic' is set in Chicago Museum (in the novel it was New York). Whilst on an expedition to the Amazon, an anthropologist (Dr Whitney) comes across an ancient tribe. They allow him to take part in their festivities and give him a drink made from a plant. They also have an interesting carved figure - a relic, representing Kothoga, son of Satan. Whitney panics and shouts 'Kothoga!' as he sees something in the distance blackness beyond the tribe. He is last seen boarding a freighter. The relic, packed in plant leaves in a wooden box arrives at the museum, but Whitney doesn't. He hasn't been heard from in months.Meanwhile Chicago Homocide Lieutenant D'Agosta and his partner board a cargo ship that has been found adrift off Chicago. It appears to be unoccupied, but there is a certain smell in the air. They suspect it is the bilge. However, when they open the doors, they discover the decapitated remains of the crew.Next thing you know, there's a guard killed in the same way at the museum, and the pathologist discovers that his brain has been munched and the hypothalamus (the hormone regulator of the brain) is missing. The same goes for the dead men off the cargo ship. The museum wants this murder swept under the carpet and believes the case is solved when a homeless man carrying the victim's watch and wallet is shot by a scared police officer. The reason they want the murders solved quickly and quietly is because they have a big gala opening planned for a new exhibition, known as 'Superstition'. The exhibition is big and creepy with lots of tall walls and lights and audio switched on by motion sensors. It follows the burial superstitions and other legends of ancient peoples. Dr Whitney's 'Kothoga' relic will be a central exhibit.While this is going on, Dr Margo Green, an evolutionary biologist at the museum, has taken a sample of some of the leaves found in Dr Whitney's crates, and is running it through her 'extropulator' machine to identify it's DNA. She's surprised to discover lizard DNA in a virus on the leaves, and that the leaves have a high concentration of chemicals found in a human hypothalamus. The rest of the leaves have been burned by museum staff.Basically, from then on it becomes a blood bath. It's not scary. It's not particularly interesting. It's laughable. First off, the Good Points The museum set was magnificent, the autopsy scene and the bodies on the drifting ship were good. The suspense at the beginning had me on the edge of my seat.The Bad Points There was little character development - I didn't care who lived or died. Dr Margo Green was bitchy and rude, and I could have quite happily watched her get munched. Without engaging characters, a lot of the movie dragged. Some of the scenes were too dark and you could hardly see what was going on. The creature was overdone - too much CGI and too visible, you knew what it was and where it was most of the time. The guard's crime scene was laughable, it looked plastic. There wasn't enough blood on the walls for somebody who had been decapitated, and the head and brain were just sitting there, not all splattered like you would expect after a wild animal had smashed his skull. But overall, the biggest problem was there was NO SUSPENSE to keep you jittering in your seat going 'where is the monster now?'If you have read the book I suspect you will be disappointed Characters die who lived in the book. Some major characters are excluded, leaving a tired, clich√©d plot. FBI Agent Pendergast, Bill Smithback, Dr Moriarty, FBI Agent Coffey and some museum bureaucrats - are sorely missed. The characters who are included do so in name only. Characters names and genders are changed - Dr Cuthbert is female, Greg Kawitika becomes Greg Lee. Dr Frock was the only character true to his book character.The creature is not at all human in appearance - I was expecting something like a great ape with lizard skin and forward pointing, narrow red eyes, with the signature clawed hands. This thing is basically all mouth and tail, with fantastical abilities, such as being able to climb sheer walls and hang off the ceiling and swim without needing to take a breath. There is little sympathy for the creature, which is a killing machine, while in the book, I at least, felt sorry for the creature - out of it's habitat and starving because it's main food source had been destroyed, and for what had happened to it and what it was before. It's also known all along that the leaves are what the creatures after, not the Kothoga figure (called Mbwum in the book), which takes away all suspense. All in all the book was a lot smarter, a lot more chilling and a lot more original. I'd advise you only to watch this movie if you want some cheap thrills and a bit of a giggle. If you want to be entertained by something more substantial, read the book.

The least effective sequences show us the (mostly CGI) monster in all its hideous splendor tearing up and presumably consuming various and sundry characters. The opening sequence involving detectives discovering lots of blood and tons of body parts aboard an abandoned freighter -- ironically not to be found in the novel -- is not half-bad and somewhat reminiscent of Dracula. Tom Sizemore as an exasperated cop is better than the material, and it is a delight to see James Whitmore in this, Whitmore having been the costar of the best giant ant movie of all time, THEM!

A much scarier flick employing a similar-looking monster committing similar nasty deeds can be found in the French thriller BROTHERHOOD OF THE WOLF.

I've pretty much had it with horror films that begin with images of a savage jungle tribe performing some sort of voodoo-ritual and then abruptly cut to the Western world after the opening credits. These intros nearly always turn out irrelevant and it seems that scriptwriters use it as a standard when they can't come up with a reasonable explanation for the origin of the story's evil. Anyway, Peter Hyams' The Relic makes up for this right away, as a Detroit museum receives a shipment of bizarre crates, seemly without a meaningful content. They appear to be filled with simple leafs but, shortly after, the museum's night guard is literally torn to pieces by a giant monster. Homicide detective Vincent D'Agosta (Tom Sizemore) and DNA-specialist Margo Green (Penelope Ann Miller) team up and discover that the leafs contained some sort of unidentified fungus that systematically mutated into a wild monster. D'Agosta insists that the museum should close its doors, but a large social happening with eminent benefactors on the guest list makes this impossible&#133; You don't really expect a movie like this to be gory, since it was well-promoted and stars a couple of big names, but The Relic offers some surprisingly nasty killings (numerous decapitations) and vicious monster effects (we have Stan Winston to thank for that). Horror fans will definitely also appreciate the extended and atmospherically filmed sequences in the museum catacombs, showing how a small group of survivors desperately trying to flee from the monster. The story is rather well scripted and contains both scientific mumbo-jumbo (of which I didn't understand one word) and witty jokes (the female autopsy-doctor is quite hilarious). The Relic isn't a very original film &#150; more like Alien set in a museum &#150; but it's good fun and it delivers a fair amount of effective thrills.

While they got the basic storyline down, that is about all that was done right. They omitted central characters, simplified the plot, and just dumbed down the movie about 300% from the novel. If you want a cheesy sci fi thriller, this will do it for ya, but if you want a good movie, stay away.The acting was not terrible, at least. However, as i said, they took out central characters, and took out a big chunk of the back story, so the acting really is the least of your concerns when you set down to watch the movie.

I can only hope that the source material is better than this adaptation, because the thought of anything that resembles this mess being accepted by a publisher really is enough to make an aspiring author abandon all hope. Exactly why actors like Tom Sizemore or Penelope Ann Miller would want to have anything to do with this mess has got me beat.I'm probably getting ahead of myself here. The plot, such as it is, concerns itself with a creature that stalks a museum and kills things. Something about a couple of crates containing hormone (and fungus)-laced plants also comes into it. The amount of plot points that come out of the dark with no connection to the rest of the plot is as unbelievable as the idea that this film is meant to have anything to do with a relic.In the end, the whole thing comes off as a poor man's Aliens set in a present-era museum. The less we know about the threat of the story, the more effectively it works. By the time we see the creature that begs for explanation as to how it got to the museum without prior detection, one is left to wonder if Stan Winston and his celebrated crew really put any effort into making *that*.Penelope Ann Miller does a reasonable job with the main character upon whom the entire film rests, but you can tell she's about to fire her agent. Tom Sizemore has the role of the unlikeable, obnoxious hero down to a fine art, so he is perfectly cast here. Unfortunately, he is never given anything beyond this prototypical role to perform. His character's lack of dimensions two and three only serve to highlight this problem in the rest of the cast. If I ever remember the names or faces of any of the support cast, it will be a small miracle.I gave The Relic a three out of ten. It is simply too bad to be any good, and too good to be any bad. In the parlance of most media critics, professional or otherwise, this basically translates to No Man's Land, which would have made a better title for the film.

The only adaptation I've ever seen that was worse was The Bourne Identity.  The book is FAR superior to the film, which takes out all of the things that make the book great, reducing this to a B horror movie.  Two of the main sources of conflict in the book (the museum director and the FBI agent Coffey), and the lead hero, are completely left out.  So you really have no one to root for.  The cop D'Agosta, has a ridiculous trait in that he's superstitious to the point of absurdity in the movie. I guess they thought this was clever since the film revolves around the opening of an exhibit entitled Superstition.  They show him doing superstitious things over and over, like not stepping over bodies, carrying a good luck charm, worrying about black cats, etc.  Okay, WE GET IT!  The guy's superstitious!  We don't need to be hit over the head with it.  The ending of the film and the way they kill the creature is rehashed and boring.  Margo, played by Penelope Ann Miller, is boring and whiny.  You don't really care if she dies.  If you like the standard creature gets loose and kills everyone horror movies, you might enjoy this.  BUt if you're looking for something deeper and much more scary, I'd highly suggest reading the novel instead.

Here he made a movie of the novel of Douglas Preston with the same title. The movie is in the mean time also a satire on the behaviour of politicians such as the mayor (Robert Lesser), who wants to be called your honour by lieutenant Vincent D'Agosta (Tom Sizemore), name he even cannot speak out correctly.  Politicians only think about elections and are not aware of real danger and cannot listen to a good advice, idea which is developed in the movie.

I read this book when it first came out and had seen the original posters at me nearby theater more than A YEAR before it actually came out. When it did come out the old posters ( a Gothic type museum exterior in dark blue/green/ and with red blood down the entrance with the black shades seemingly making an unrecognizable ape like face) had been terminated and the new advertisements (the red and black guy screaming posters) had replaced it.That sums it up right there. During the making of the film apparently the Producers felt the original creature from the book was too damn small. Of course it didn't occur to them that the 2 story tall beast they created couldn't fit in a public washroom where apparently it gets most of it's joy. Vaseline perhaps included? must be able to shrink.One of the reasons i liked the book was that it used a hunters mind from all points and perspectives. The creature from the book was built to kill and destroy. It was built efficiently with no dead weight. Something living on a small amount of brain tissue ...well you think about it... what do junkies look like? I felt the book was very realistic. the animal is a junkie, it doesn't eat whales. The animal is supposed to be of Raptor height so it can get you in a closet and be efficient in build, speed, and energy.I don't know if LC and DP were happy about the adaptation of the book (no pun intended). I certainly was not. They cut out some of the best scenes and Da GOsta was cut from the movie --- his name is used in the movie but the character is in fact Pendergasts and not the fat sarcastic buffoon who wanted to pi**ss on all authority a-holes. I missed having the two characters together and their camaraderie. I thought their partnership was key in the book.THey (film) made a mockery of the exhibit chase in the dark... which in the book i found the most intense part. They did not do justice to the swat team involvement... instead they just made the creature the size of the entire museum hall (which had skinny hallways leading to it---apparently it does some sort of star Trekky beaming to get from room to room -- otherwise the physics are impossible). The final sewer chase was laughable because of the assumption the creature had shrunk yet again to conveniently fit in that small space. I didn't like the ending either ... since i felt the entire book...as i said above... came from a hunters mind ... i felt the ending in the book kept to this but the movie went for THE CHEESIEST LINE EVER!!! and fireworks which weren't even decent.I have been hoping the Porduction company does not own open rights to the book but payed royalties to use it . That would keep new adaptations possible. Id prefer the writers staying true to their vision next time and showing some integrity. They could have made a classic if they had had some balls and kept to it.To those who thought dumbing it up and selling out to the cheese puffs i repeat the cheesiest line ever GO TO HE** "},{"Title":"More Alien cloning...","Date":"7 August 2007","Score":"0 out of 3 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Horror, Mystery, Sci-Fi","Review":" A stupid and even occasionally boring Alien copy.

Too little happens in the first half, and it takes even longer for us to finally get to see this creature.

Last few weeks I have been watching mostly horror movies and I have come to this conclusion  anything goes nowadays as a horror movie if it shows severed heads.

Then there is the museum. It's like some weird hybrid of Fort Knox and library. And there is underground sewers where homeless people live...under the fortknoxish library. And so on.The screenplay, and particularly when things start to happen, is awful. That's because it's either dark, or you'll see just a little glimpse of the thing thats eating Gilbert's grape. But even though it sometimes is far more horrifying what you can't see, in this case it doesn't work because the director can't simply keep the scary atmosphere up. It's like Ooh, look Willie - it's a severed head! Blaablaalbaa BLaablaa Ooh Willie, look it's my dog! Well...I don't even start with the plot. It's just a typical monster-film plot. Something comes from somewhere and then it's time to run in fear because that something that came from somewhere is big, bad, and ugly.
