This time the puppets from he Land That Time Forgot are gone in favour of men in monster suits, which is a lot more fun if you're willing to suspend your disbelief, and if you're not there's always Caroline Munro's cleavage to look at. Aside from what may well be Peter Cushing's worst performance, an irritating but dottier rehash of his movie Dr Who (You can't mesmerise me, I'm British!), it's easily the best of the John Dark-Kevin Connor-Doug McClure fantasy adventures, surprisingly well directed and boasting an atmospheric use of colour. Never especially good at exterior scenes, Alan Hume's photography gains immensely from the control a studio set gives him (the film was shot entirely on soundstages) to paint a luridly vivid world worthy of a pulp novel cover. Not high art but definitely great Saturday matin√©e fun.

Yes, some of the special effects are painfully bad but what a lot of folks overlook about it is that it's actually quite fun, which is very important in my book.In comparison, just look at the latest STAR WARS films they have the latest, greatest special effects created by the latest technological advances which are capable in creating stunning visual effects as far reaching as the human imagination can imagine and yet, with all the razzle dazzle, those films were as exciting as a funeral. As Yoda would say, Fun they're not! In other words, who cares if the FX aren't the greatest when the spirit of the film is fast-paced, humorous and clearly set on the side of action. I love everything about AT THE EARTH'S CORE the contrast between stodgy Victorian England VS the wild other-worldly, colorful setting of Pellucidar, the cast of characters, the concept of a lost underground world, the telepathic Pterodactyls, the human slaves rebelling, Jubal the ugly one (lol!), the inspired teaming of Peter Cushing (who's great!) and Doug McClure, the excellent music (it's really good), cinematography by the amazing Alan Hume and last but not least, Caroline Munro. She's effing sexy in this movie. One of the sexiest B-movie babes ever captured on screen.Seriously, anyone who doesn't like this movie doesn't know what fun is. Gimme AT THE EARTH'S CORE over any turgid STAR WARS prequels any time! At least it has Caroline Munro, which no CGI fx can ever recreate.

It is a primordial world existing on the underside of the earth's crust, with the central core of magma providing a perpetual noonday sun. The land is full of ancient mammals, dinosaurs and beautiful cave girls. The story begins with a eccentric inventor and his friend who plan to explore the earth's crust in an 'iron mole.' They go off course and plunge toward the center of the earth, finally surfacing in Pellucidar. They discover a world in which telepathic flying reptiles dominate, and human cave tribes are either on the run or enslaved. What do our plucky explorers do upon encountering this primeval world? They attempt to liberate the humans and civilize them! There are a lot of cheesy 'Lost World' type movies. At the Earth's Core is certainly one of the cheesiest. I would never argue with those believe that this is a bad movie, but I love it. The setting has a wonderful inner world feel with weird plants and a pale red sky. The caverns and tunnels are well developed. The iron mole looks very cool. The cave people and Sagoth costumes are adequate and cheesy in a fun '70s way. How about the dinosaurs and creatures? Hmm. The monsters in this movie are the lamest monsters to ever grace the silver screen. They set a standard for lameness that will probably never be surpassed. But as lame-o as the monsters are, they are a fun and active group. Several of them seem to have a propensity for exploding at the moment of death. That's always fun, isn't it? The Mahar telepathic powers are clearly presented with the eyes lighting up, the zzzzzz-zrt! sound, the eyelids closing. 'Cmon, admit it, it's a cool effect. And the way the Mahars swoop down upon the sacrificial cave girls, this scene actually provides a moment of horror, in spite of the lame Mahar costumes. Doug McClure, Peter Cushing and Caroline Monroe are perfectly cast in the roles of David Innes, Abner Perry and Dian the Beautiful. I can no longer read the books without picturing these actors in the story. I could have watched many Pellucidar sequels with these actors. McClure is the perfect actor for any cheesy lost world adventure. Nobody - and I mean nobody - fights lame-o monsters like Doug McClure. The guy is brilliant. Check out the arena scene, where he faces off against a lame saber-toothed hippo thing. McClure swings, he grits, he staggers and strains. I love how he jukes the monster off balance to retrieve the spear head from underneath it. Yeah! What other actor would have put so much into that scene? Peter Cushing is certainly a far better actor than this movie deserves, and yet he gives a surprising and outrageous performance. Don't critique him too much for hamming it up, some of his lines are right out of the book, and the character calls for a goofball. Caroline Monroe looks like she just stepped out of a Frank Frazetta painting. Too bad her role is limited to being a mere one-dimensional love interest. Sure, it is a cheesy movie. But if you can suspend disbelief and stay with this movie, you just might like it. No question, it is a challenge to hang in there, neither mocking the movie nor beating your head against the wall. If you can get in, and stay in, this is an amazing lost world movie. But you have to fight the cheesiness, you have to fight the lameness. You have to fight like Doug McClure!

Nowadays, however, I find this whole sorry affair just about watchable thanks to the gorgeous Caroline Munro, a major hottie of the 70s who spends this film prancing around in a skimpy outfit that reveals her ample cleavage, and the unintentional laughs that can be had from the awful dialogue, bargain basement visuals, and general atmosphere of cheesiness.

As bad as the rubber-suited pterodactyl men look, they pale in comparison to what I'll call the saber-toothed hippo and the giant fire-breathing frog. You've also got Doug McClure trying in vain to play the hero. It doesn't work. On the positive side you've got Peter Cushing hamming it up like I've never seen before and a sense of fun about the whole thing. It never takes itself too seriously. Just let yourself go with the silliness. Another positive I feel compelled to mention are the outfits worn by Caroline Munro. Too bad she disappears for about 2/3 of the movie.

AT THE EARTH'S CORE in fact is reminiscent of Jules Verne stories like JOURNEY TO THE CENTRE OF THE EARTH, although it is supposedly from a story by Edgar Rice Burroughs. The low-rent action and outrageous imagery make this film a must for any '70s fan. The decade's influence is clear, as a number of native tribesmen sport fetching afros! Although the film is cheaply made (it employs VOYAGE TO THE BOTTOM OF THE SEA-style shaking cameras to simulate movement), on the plus side it is a fast-paced adventure tale which never lets up and gives in to characterisation or depth of any sort. In essence it's a series of fight scenes, which take the form of monster vs. monster, man vs. man, man vs. monster. Tacky, ludicrous and awful, this is truly the nadir of British cinema. But...it manages to be exciting, hilarious and a damned good ride through a strange, psychedelic prehistoric land, enlivened by strong performances from two genre veterans.AT THE EARTH'S CORE has a number of spaced-out, obviously drug-induced sequences which are hilarious to watch. The first is the bit where Peter Cushing, no less, is being chased through the cardboard jungle by a giant bird man! I've seen some weird stuff in my time but this really takes the biscuit. The bird men are guys with huge rubber heads on, strange how they remain so motionless throughout the film. The second moment is when a group of people stop to watch some men in monster suits battle it out, kind of like a wacky GODZILLA moment which has been inserted in the film. For a start it's not for one minute believable or realistic, and also the bellowing noises these monsters make are hilarious! More wackiness ensues when a psychic connection between the bird and rodent men is revealed, with the bird guys blinking their green eyes to give commands, these birds are truly strange and yet wonderfully artistic. Especially the noises that are made, which are strangely computerised! Another hilarious moment comes when Peter Cushing shoots a fire breathing, pincushion-like monster with some arrows, it falls off a cliff and explodes in a rib-tickling scene, so cheap and yet so comic. You probably have to have a weird sense of humour like me to appreciate these admittedly dodgy delights. Other merry moments include a caveman with a blatantly cardboard weapon and bird men flying around on visible wires.You've probably grasped the kind of na√Øve charm this film holds for me by now, but the three main actors are also reasons to watch. Firstly we have low-budget British actress Caroline Munro as the token love interest in highly revealing costume, then there's Doug McClure as the American hero, sporting a disgusting striped jacket. McClure's charm is one which you have to view to really appreciate, but let's just say he's fun as the brawny, indestructible hero type. However it's Peter Cushing who steals the show, this time around being the comic relief, a major departure from his usually heroic or sinister roles. His doddering old man is a great creation, and his dialogue is along the lines of they're so excitable, like all foreigners and You cannot mesmerise me, I'm British! (reused from a similar line in HORROR EXPRESS). The novelty value of seeing him terrorised by these men in suits is great.You wouldn't get away with tackiness like this in a film anymore, that's for sure. Cheap, with atrocious back projection; rubbery, cardboard, yet fun, AT THE EARTH'S CORE is one for the child in all of us - the child who truly appreciate the delights of bad film making.

Accompanying him is former student turned businessman David Innes (Doug McClure). The vehicle is more powerful than they thought, and they end up deep inside the Earths' core. Here they encounter a nonstop assortment of monsters, a kingdom named Pellucidar, a tribe of primitive people, and their subhuman captors / tormentors, who pray to dinosaur gods.Now how can you resist any hokum featuring those elements? Produced by Amicus, and scripted by Milton Subotsky (based on the novel by Edgar Rice Burroughs), this is decently executed by director Kevin Connor, who was a real go-to filmmaker for this kind of fantasy material in the 1970s. McClure is a jut jawed hero, and Cushing seems to be relishing a rare opportunity to ham it up. His performance may not be one of his most accomplished, but it's certainly a fun one. Caroline Munro is *extremely* alluring as cave girl Dia. Also performing this amiable nonsense with straight faces are Cy Grant as the helpful Ra, Godfrey James as the stolid Ghak, and Sean Lynch as the devious Hoojah (just to be sure we get the point, Hoojah is nicknamed The Sly One).The movie begins in grand style, with some striking opening titles and a beautiful, rousing piece of music. It promises a solid diversion, and that's what it delivers. The understandable criticisms often leveled at the production are its obvious budget issues, and rubber monsters. But these monsters are just so damn amusing, especially the exploding fire breathing frog. All of this is done in an agreeable tradition of the Saturday matin√©e feature. The sets and the visuals are reasonably impressive, and Connor keeps things moving along nicely (the movie hits the ground running), and building to an exciting and destructive finale.At the Earth's Core does put a goofy smile on *this* viewers' face.Seven out of 10.

The studio productions were very good and very elaborate. The background effects were very believable and always appeared as if they were part of the whole set. The actors did OK considering the premise of the film being set in a type of Jules Vern atmosphere where imagination and possibilities of future exploration were at most improbabilities. Had I watched this film in 1976 I probably would have been in awe of the ability of man to build a machine that could travel to the earths core. I still wonder to this day why we are not all flying around in our cars but I digress. McClure and Cushing have their funny moments, mostly from their facial expressions toward each other which of course makes the film somewhat campy which I loved. The 'monsters' left something to be desired but the story had a good premise although I feel as though some other sort of 'thing' could have been more believable under those circumstances. All in all quite watchable for its time and fun now.

Clearly they were not from the same country, so I couldn't grasp why they were traveling together.I do recall seeing the mechanism in the fire-breathing monster's mouth.What connects this movie for me is the opening with the molten metal and then suddenly we get the band playing as we see the factory.How do you end a movie like this? The music again, and two bewlidered cops as the drill appears behind them.Whatever reason, I remember watching this movie more that Friday night than I do any new cartoon that came on the following morning.That was definitely the late seventies.It would be during Jurassic Park mania, cicra '93, I believe, before I would see this movie again.Yes, people in costumes.

Forget that the puppets used in the production rival The Beast Master for being the fakest-looking of all-time. No, the real genius of At the Earth's Core is its naive stupidity -- a gung-ho action spectacle without real action and without real spectacle.

Busty Caroline Munro provides the obligatory female interest & what a cracking piece of crumpet she was back when this movie was released in 1976.

Giant burrowing machine gives way to ho-hum hokum","Date":"21 January 2015","Score":"","Genre":"Sci-Fi, Adventure, Fantasy","Review":" At the Earth's core 1976 21.1.15Impressive opening titles lit by the flickering red light of furnaces speak of vast engineering enterprise, which of course such an incredible machine would have required. The very distinctive silhouette of the tall extremely thin figure of Peter Cushing in high collar and top hat very neatly identifies the period, his character and him as the quirky genius behind it all. So far, very good. The opening scenes are quite impressive showing the vast machine in the distance and in close-up parts of the massive support structure it required. Such a marvel was this fictional Victorian machine (130 years later still science-fiction) that it would have been world wide news. On its first trial - a short burrow into a Welsh hillside, it suddenly though takes an unexpected precipitous downwards dive. Unfortunately so too at this point, does the film. Peter Cushing throughout gives an excellent thoroughly animated consistent performance as the elderly and rather frail and fussy inventor. He acts throughout as if the journey, the film and the role - mattered. In contrast a cigar-chomping Doug McClure behaves like world-weary freighter co-pilot on just another routine flight in just another routine film.In sci-fi its is always a question as to how much science and plausible fact to include. In the masterpiece 2001, a very great deal - it gave weight and logic to the story. In this, its complete antithesis, very close to zero. In something like 3 minutes' screen time the giant machine has burrowed approximately 4000 miles downwards through the Earth's core. It gets a little hot then a little cold but otherwise causes little more fuss, fatigue or fear for the crew than an trans-Atlantic flight. They arrive after this incredible journey, open the hatch only to find themselves in what appears to be the middle the complete cast of aliens and set in an average Dr Who episode. What ensues are chases and fist fights, the things that have filled time in brainless films since the dawn of cinema. The giant burrowing machine does manage to recover from its catastrophic downwards dive. The film however never does. 7/10 for the titles 3/10 for the rest "},{"Title":"Enormous fun!","Date":"7 October 2014","Score":"","Genre":"Sci-Fi, Adventure, Fantasy","Review":" The film is rather low budget and the sets, make-up and special effects are more 1956 than 1976 but, by God, it's enormous fun. Peter Cushing and the underrated Doug McClure, who have great chemistry, make excellent leads as Dr. Abner Doc Perry and David Innes respectively. Cushing plays Doc as a lovable, eccentric gentleman adventurer in the same mould as Dr. Who in the Dalek films and gets the lion's share of the best lines. Caroline Munro is a very appealing leading lady as Princess Dia while Cy Grant offers great support as Ra. The film has no pretence about scientific accuracy - even when the Edgar Rice Burroughs novel was written in 1914, the idea of a hollow Earth was considered pseudoscientific nonsense - but that's one of the things that I love about it. While it is quite derivative of The Time Machine, it has a good storyline which rollicks along at a great pace.

Caroline Munro is sexy and gorgeous in here that you are kinda disappointed that she has fairly limited screen time. Sadly, they both play supporting roles to Doug McClure who plays the leading American character. And he is really damn good in his part. He has a nice screen presence and he manages to bring enough intensity and emotion to a role which demands him to be just a white knight figure.

Just take a look at the first monster attack when a man is eaten by the creature. This sequence is one of the funniest things I've seen from any sci-fi picture. The entire catalog of monsters are pretty fun to watch even with the rubber suits that make some of those Godzilla creatures look like Oscar-winning work. Even the monsters holding the human slaves are incredibly cheap as they just wear masks that cover half of their faces with their normal skin still showing making it all the more obvious. Cushing plays a dimwitted scientist and while his performance is good the character is certainly less than memorable.

All three starred the late Doug McClure and fell into the category of light entertainment. They were typified by simplistic effects, and a general feeling that production was rushed, in order to simply get something into the theater ASAP.Being essentially adventure films with science-fiction touches, the requisite special effects work was far beneath that the ad campaigns suggested (even the dreary WHERE TIME BEGAN had somewhat better effects than CORE, and much of LAND was built around a floppy rubber pterodactyl.Of these three titles, CORE possesses the most atmosphere in that it is presented as a period piece, evidently set at the close of the 1800s. This lends the film a certain charm, particularly in the design of the bizarre Mole, poised ready to bury itself in the bowels of the Earth.The film also shines as a showcase for Peter Cushing who was clearly slumming in a role which was far beneath his usual from the Hammer era. As he frequently did in lesser films, Cushing played about with the role and emerged with something far better than might have been expected from a less talented and inventive actor.Would-be adventurer David Innes (McClure) has financed eccentric inventor Professor Abner Perry's (Peter Cushing in another of his amusingly conceived character roles) manned excavator, the Iron Mole. Innes hopes that, aside from getting away from it for a while, he can find untapped resources beneath the surface of the Earth. After a little preparation, the duo blast off for inner space.They arrive at the by-now familiar primordial cavern-world, filled with dinosaurs, primitive savages, and the delicious Carolyn Monroe as a local princess. The trio face off against winged creatures who dominate the underworld, eventually winning through by a mixture of bravado and genuine courage.Though not remotely an effective adventure film, and suffering badly in the face of the computer generated effects which were just beginning to spring into the movies at this time, CORE works best when accepted simply as a fun romp. Cushing, in particular, steals the show as Perry -- using props (something he became noted for in his work to flesh out occasionally one-note characters) and exhibiting an unexpected fighting spirit.An 8 out of 10 for sheer fun value "},{"Title":"core values","Date":"3 August 2006","Score":"","Genre":"Sci-Fi, Adventure, Fantasy","Review":" At the Earth's Core, as far as I could tell, was deliberately trying to be sort of corny.

The script for At the Earth's Core by Milton Subotsky, based on the novel by Edgar Rice Burroughs of the same name, was very entertaining. It moves along like a rocket, we're at the Earth's core & seeing monsters within the first fifteen minutes & generally speaking the film carries on at a great pace. Luckily it never seems to take itself too seriously. It contains likable characters, good action adventure elements, the obligatory monsters & even has time to chuck in a bit of romance. However, I could have done without the mushy sentimentality at the end. A lot of people seem to criticise the special effects in At the Earth's Core & to be fair they ain't all that hot but they add a certain charm & personality to the film overall. I quite liked the monsters in this actually, from the Mahar's to the giant fire breathing frog creature. Just forget about the obvious wire work or the silly man in a rubber monster suit trying to walk menacingly, sit back & enjoy, you never know you might have some fun as I did. The production design was impressive, Pellucidar looks quite good with it's purple sky & jungle landscapes with it's bizarre plants, giant mushroom's & the City of the Mahar's with it's underground caverns & flowing lava. I also really liked the look of the drilling machine, both inside & out. The acting is OK, I'm a huge Cushing fan & think he's a great actor & I really liked him in this. Cushing plays Abner with a goofy charm, referring to the Sagoth as 'unpleasent characters' or when faced with a rampaging monster he says 'yes, it does seem a somewhat aggressive looking creature' or when the Mahar's try to control him he comments 'you can't mesmerise me, I'm British!'. McClure makes for a decent hero & Munro is fine, if a little underused, as the love interest & again there's a great bit when Dia says 'it's Jubal the Ugly One' to which McClure replies after seeing him 'you can say that again'. Personally I like this type of 'lost world' film & At the Earth's Core is a good example of the genre. On the down side the special effects do hurt it at the end of the day as it's sometimes a little hard to keep a straight face & the film definitely loses some credibility because of it. I also thought that there was a little too much walking around in caves which did start to become annoying, the fact that except for McClure nobody else has that much screen time & I didn't understand the explanation given for the Mahar's power. Overall I think At the Earth's Core is a good Saturday morning fantasy adventure film with a little bit of romance thrown in for good measure that's suitable for all ages, all that's left to say is that bad special effects don't automatically make for a bad film just as the opposite is true.

The movie starts off pretty good and it makes you think that this is going to be a very impressive movie. Things quickly go down hill. Pardon the pun. Inside this underground world the travelers encounter humans that speak perfect English. No one in the film seems surprised by this in the least. Then there are the encounters with monsters. All of the monsters look ridiculous and are laughable. They really are very poorly done. It takes a lot away from the movie. The underground scenery isn't bad but could have been better. The acting is good but the plot has a lot of problems. A lot of the situations are just not believable and little or no explanations are given for them. 'At the Earth's Core' has to be watched entirely as a fun movie. Nothing can be taken too seriously or critically. Watching it that way, it can be an OK movie.

However, that's not saying much. In fact, AT THE EARTH'S CORE is a silly fantasy adventure in which Peter Cushing - who appears to be on something strong - and some other actor (whom I don't know) use a giant digging machine called the Iron Mole dig their way down to the Earth's core - only to find that the inside of the Earth is pink and populated by ape-like creatures who have enslaved the humans. There's also a giant bird that controls the apes by means of telepathy, and we get to see it blink its eyes in closeup throughout the film. Most importantly, Cushing and what's-his-name also encounter the lovely Caroline Munro in the subterranean caves. And here's what I've really got against this little flick why oh why is it that whenever Munro's in a movie, she only gets approx. 5 minutes of screen time? In THE SPY WHO LOVED ME, MANIAC, DRACULA AD 1972, GOLDEN VOYAGE OF SINBAD - always she's in the background! How can Kevin Connor possibly think that we'd rather listen to Peter Cushing's fake accent and look at some ridiculous ape-man whose voice sounds like a scratched cd than gaze at the beautiful Munro? I don't get it. Please, somebody direct a movie where this English brunette is on-screen all the time!

The duo discover an ancient prehistoric world populated by dangerous gigantic beasts and human beings who are used as both food and slaves by evil telepathic pterodactyl men. Director Kevin Conner, working from a blithely silly script by Milton Subotsky, maintains a constant brisk pace throughout and treats the exceptionally foolish premise with astonishing seriousness, thereby giving this picture a certain clunkily earnest quality that's amusing and endearing in equal measure. The lovably hokey (not so) special effects are quite (unintentionally) funny. The cheesy array of cut-price creatures in particular are positively sidesplitting cruddy guys-in-obvious-shoddy-rubber-suits pterodactyl men, equally rinky-dink savage ape-man brutes, and a hilariously ludicrous fire-belching frog thing who blows up real good. One gut-busting highlight occurs when McClure mixes it up with a fat and clumsy giant reptile. Another priceless scene depicts a dinosaur clutching a doll in its slavering jaws. Moreover, we also get some rousing rough'n'ready fisticuffs and an exciting climactic slave revolt. It's a total treat to see Cushing gleefully ham it up in a rare broad comedic part and become an unlikely, but enthusiastic arrow-slinging action hero in the last third of the flick. The ever-luscious Caroline Munro looks positively yummy as the fetching Princess Dia, plus there are nice supporting turns by Cy Grant as gallant warrior Ra and Sean Lynch as treacherous coward Hoojah. Mike Vickers' neatly varied score alternates between jaunty orchestral music and wonky droning synthesizer stuff. Alan Hume's crisp cinematography adds a glossy sheen to the infectiously inane proceedings. A complete campy riot. "},{"Title":"A fair rendition of a E.R.

His DG initials are like a special cinema-certification, that comes somewhere before 'U'. Cushing, on the other hand, seemed to suffer¬†from both a dilatory agent and poor judgement of his own. He did excellent work in the Hammer movies as Dr Van Helsing. I'v seen him do a very passable Sherlock Holmes in 'Hound Of The Baskervilles'. And his magnum opus was probably Grand Moff Tarkin in the first 'Star Wars'. The only man but the emperor who could tell Darth Vadar to 'stop bickering' and get away with it. But - crikey! - he's done some turkeys. There was that lamentable 'Daleks' movie for one. And here's another.There's a machine that's been hijacked from Tracy Island. It's a cylinder with a screw at the front and traction devices at the sides. I'm surprised Jerry Anderson didn't sue for plagiarism. Maybe he was bought-off. Yet if the movie is any guide, they can't have paid him much.It's 1976 and we're still playing about in latex romper-suits. That's about it really. Some movies have an entertainment value in the 'so bad it's good' category. This one doesn't even manage that. It wouldn't even entertain kids. 'Crash Corrigan's' stuff from the 1930's has got more going for it.

This movie is only recommended if you really enjoy bad kitschy SF. And the music...yikes!

Maybe not a worst movie ever contender, but if you haven't seen that many bad ones, this could easily make your Top Ten Worst List. When you consider what was achieved in 1933 with the original King Kong, you've got to ask yourself why anyone would stoop so low as to produce this debacle. Then, taking it one step further and realizing that the quantum leap to Star Wars the following year achieved a new level in sci-fi entertainment, this offering will make you laugh and cry at the same time.Now let me ask you, what would possess the Professor (Peter Cushing) to bring along an umbrella as a prime piece of subterranean research equipment for the ride to the earth's core? OK, so it was useful in fending off the parrot/tyrannosaur (parrotosaurus?) in the early going, but come on. Somehow I don't think this is what Edgar Rice Burrough's had in mind when he wrote his tales of Pellucidar. He probably didn't have Caroline Munro in mind either as Princess Dia, probably the only redeeming factor to this whole escapade.At least there was one bit of pseudo-scientific explanation that I got a kick out of; I'm always looking for one in films like this. That would have to be how the sky at the earth's core was really the underside of the earth's crust, explaining that ethereal pinkish glow. But try as it might, the story just couldn't hook me in a way to find anything at all interesting about Hoojah the Sly One or Jubal the Ugly One, much less those goofy half man, half pterodactyl creatures.

McClure looks more gummy-faced and wooden than ever. His tough boy combat bits are just hilarious; too bad he was either taking himself seriously or badly in need of a paycheck. I have seen many films starring Peter Cushing, and i have always praised his acting skills & his characters, way above B movies he typically starred in. This is an exception. His portrayal of a sclerotic/eccentric aging scientist goes over one's head (and on one's nerves ) fast...really fast. This said, in spite of opening credits, Cushing is hardly a star there are many characters pivoting around McClure. SFX are passable to laughable, making earliest Japanese monster movies look like true art. Telepathic giant parrots pull the strings of a subhuman tribe (=morons wearing poorly made prosthetics with a pig's nose ) that enslaves humans. Parrots eat hotties then. The prehistoric sets aren't all that bad, but it is CLEARLY seen we're dealing with limited studio sets, much like same age SPACE 1999 and not with open air sets. Acting is negligible; Cushing gets on my nerves and McClure seems to forget he isn't starring ALAMO or BEN HUR or ENTER THE DRAGON but some low-budget niche movie whose villains are men in a giant parrot's suit. Caroline Munro is very sexy and nice. Worth watching only once.

It's so stagy, you can taste the dust of the sets and feel the heath of the lamps above. The thing looks like a very, very big budget school play, or indeed, a very very low budget action movie, which it actually is. It's been said on many occasions that this was the last of the genre entries, and I do hope it was. The genre didn't die peacefully, but in horrible agony, amidst a lot of smoke, fake blood and lousy sound effects. Peter Cushing must have felt a boy again, as a nutty professor whose shirt stays white as snow after the gentlemen has dragged himself through the slimy crap-holes of the Underworld. What a sport he was, to accept a part in this mishmash and carry it so bravely.Shot entirely on a sound stage and accompanied by then trendy, now unbearable synthesizer soundtrack, the main anti-attraction of this film are the cardboard monsters. Yes, there are always monsters like that in a Burroughs adaptation, but they rarely manage to be so completely ridiculous, helpless or void of any credibility. On a few occasions, during the elevated action-combat scenes where Mr McClure heroically attacks the creatures, you can almost hear the empty, hollow sound as his head bangs against the side of a triplodactocryptosaurus. Fortunately, the animals explode and go up in flames the minute they trip and fell over. Indeed, there is a great deal of unmotivated exploding as the film (and the genre) draws towards the finale. And lovely Miss Munroe loses her underworldly accent.The triple bill, currently on the market, features this film plus two others - The Land That Time Forgot and The War Lords Of Atlantis. The first two are quite strong entries, especially the first one, with a lot of money invested and occasionally even fascinating script turns. Don't expect any of these qualities from this film. Get drunk with pals and laugh shamelessly at what you see. After all, the makers didn't have any shame either.
