John Patterson,eminent engineer/bridge builder to complete a bridge spanning the river by Tsavo, Africa. Arriving in the continent he has dreamed of forever, Patterson meets his project. There are problems with it Competing French and German rivals, Ethnic hatred among the crews and, on Patterson's first day there, a worker is attacked by a lion. He goes to sort it out by shooting the beast with one shot; gaining the admiration of his crews, lifting spirits, adding motivation to complete the bridge, and unleashing a nightmareOnly weeks after the shooting the camp is suddenly besieged by a pair of giant man-eating lions. Their first kill is Mahina (Henry Cele), considered the strongest man in the camp. This serves to unnerve every man on the project, including Indian rabble-rouser Abdullah, who doesn't like Patterson from the start. Nerves jangle and fray as the lions repeatedly and relentlessly attack and attack and attack! They strike under the cover of night AND during the heat of day; They kill not for hunger, not for sport, but simply because they like it. Men are dragged from their beds and mauled to death in the tall grasses; the hospital becomes a blood-bathe; Laborers aren't safe as the beasts leap out and snatch them from their work. Everything is falling apart and Patterson is at his wit's end as Beaumont arrives to make matters worse. And still the lions attack and attack and attack.Enter Big Game Hunter Charles Remington who is as determined to destroy the lions as the lions seem determined to eat every man in camp.This is an under-appreciated, well made, well scripted nail biting adventure. It boasts solid artists on both sides of the lens William Goldman penned the script, Gail Anne Hurd and H. Kitman Ho are two of the producers who know how to spend the budget wisely, the great Vilmos Zigmond is responsible for the mesmerizing African cinematography. Stephen Hopkins directs with great vision and skill and the actors are uniformly solid and believable in their roles. Val Kilmer plays Patterson with an understated, simple and elegant performance; Tom Wilkerson is the charming snake of a boss Beaumont, Brian McCardie gains the viewers sympathy as a youthful, innocent, and doomed Angus Starling, John Jani is the stalwart Project Manager Samuel, Bernard Hill the irritable/irritating Dr. Hawthorne, Om Puri is the creepy, sarcastic Abdullah (You are white. You can do anything.) and Michael Douglas, also an Executive Producer &#150; he got the money &#150; plays hunter Charles Remington, removing the sweet edges of his Romancing the Stone role to create our renown hunter.Hopkins not only knows how to build tension, suspense, and terror, but when to let us relax and how to fill that time. The quiet moments are never dull. They let us empathize with these men, their characters get to develop and we bond with them and their nightmare. Zigmond (Close Encounter of the Third Kind) uses deep oranges and blacks for the African locale, except during a daylight lion hunt and cave exploration when he switches to bright sunlight, vibrant greens and sharp browns as if to show us that even a travelogue holds a nightmare. It is near Hitchcockian.Rolling underneath the film like summer thunder (or the breathy growl and snarling of our killer lions) is Jerry Goldsmith's pounding, tribal driven score, which accents the mood and gives further dimension to the narrative. Listen closely, you can hear him using tonal motifs he developed for Star Trek The Motion Picture.As the hysteria builds and the men frenzy, many explanations are offered for the appearance of these animals Are they the spirits of medicine men come to exact revenge; Or demons sent by the devil to keep Africa unsoiled; Or have they come to claim John Patterson? Is it to helplessly watch as they strip away the layers of security around him until he is exposed and defenseless against their teeth and claws? It is no coincidence that Kilmer is photographed at times slack- faced and full on and LOOKS like a lion himself.Once this film starts, I can guarantee you that you won't be able to take a snack break, bathroom break, or even think about dozing off. It is that good. And remember this You can see the preserved bodies of these two giant man-eaters at the Field Museum in Chicago, Illinois because this incredible story is TRUE.

No true motives are ascribed to them, as how could they be?, and that actually serves to make them more demonically terrifying. But whether they are the devils come to prevent Val Kilmer's Patterson from building his bridge, or merely (!) animals hunting for the pleasure of it, they provide more suspense, more terror, and more death than most high-tech cgi aliens. Michael Douglas's Remington, dispossessed of  home and family in the American civil war, is an interesting character, but it's Kilmer's British bridge-builder in a time where engineers had to know how to shoot tigers and manage Hindu-Muslim conflicts fully as much as how to put up their structures, who is the focus of the film, and rightly so. Kilmer's performance is quiet, almost understated, but one of the best I've seen him give; he's fully convincing, especially as he fights the belief that the lions are, in fact, out to get him personally. They are just lions, he says halfway through the movie, and you can hear how much he wants to believe it. John Kani also gives a good performance, contained mostly in small moments that are so true they almost hurt. The cinematography is beautiful, especially the of the lion attacks and their passages through the grass. Again, no cgi effects could convey so much beauty and lurking menace. This movie is beautiful, intense, and dramatic; I highly recommend it.

Quite odd since it presses in the beginning that everything you're about to see in this movie, no matter how unbelievable it seems, has truly occurred. Oh well, just a good and clever marketing trick, lets leave it to that. No way they can pull off a trick like this now days in the days of Internet, were with only a few clicks you can look up an historical event. Of course the biggest difference between the truth and fiction is the Remington (Michael Douglas) character, who never existed in real life and also the looks of the lions, who in real life were not maned. But oh well, are these movie changes bad or not believable? No, it strengthens the story and makes it all even more interesting to watch.I've always loved watching The Ghost and the Darkness. It's a great adventurous movie with action in it and some good characters, all set in a beautiful environment. The story is perfectly adventurous and action filled. It's all the more amazing knowing that the story has actually occurred in real life, over an hundred years ago already. The movie and its story is kept simple and allows its images and characters to tell the story.What I like about the movie is that it fully treats the 'Ghost' and the 'Darkness' (the nicknames of the two man-eating lions) as movie characters. It shows them as smart thinking creatures and not simply just as 'monsters', even though they kill for pleasure (at least in the movie they do). The movie is definitely helped by its environment and atmosphere. The beautiful African land serves as a perfect backdrop for the movie and also works quite claustrophobic, since the movie is for most part set at just this one location (the railroad and bridge building-site). Also the great Jerry Goldsmith musical score suits the environment and perfectly adds to the atmosphere of the entire movie, as does the cinematography from Vilmos Zsigmond. Michael Douglas plays a good role and actually shows with this movie how versatile he is as an actor, though his role is definitely smaller than he is credited for in the movie. As also the producer of this movie he obviously claimed to become the top-billing actor of the movie as well. In fact the main part of the movie is being played by Val Kilmer, who plays his character in a way like we're used of him; a humble way and he doesn't try too hard to impress in his role, which also leaves room for the other actors to shine and of course allows the story to be told best. Surprising to see that the movie also had actors in it, that would later turn into big well known names such as Bernard Hill and Tom Wilkinson, in some good roles. Also Om Puri gives a nice performance.A perfectly fun and simple adventurous action movie.

Douglas plays a famous renegade American hunter, a tragically scarred Civil War veteran, hired by the railroad to kill the lions.Good adventure, well-paced, with stunning photography of the African countryside.

It's during that reign of terror the Tasvo Lions, weighing some 500 pounds each, lived or dined almost exclusively on human flesh.The film starts with Irish engineer Col. John Patterson, Val Kilmar, sent to Kenya by his British overseer, or boss, the pompous and all full of himself the future Sir, hoping that he'll be knighted by the Queen, Robert Beaumont, Tom Wilkerson. As soon as Col.Patterson arrives on the Dark Continent he's faced with a revolt by those workers that he's in charged of with them afraid to go out and build a bridge over the Tasvo River.These two man-eating lions have been snatching and devouring workers at will and it thought that they, the killer cats, aren't even lions but evil and murderous spirits preventing the bridge, that's being erected on sacred native ground, from being built. The killings go on unabated and it's when one of the local native leaders Mahina, Danny Cele, is dragged out of his tent and eaten by the lions the rail workers just refused to go back out and lay tracks, to build the bridge, over the Tasvo River.Being like phantoms more then lions the killer cats are immune to anything that Col. Patterson and his native guide Samuel, John Kani, can come up with in both trapping and killing the two giant felines. It's then out of sheer desperation that the I've never been wrong in all my life Robert Beaumont, it must have taken a lot out of his giant ego, hires big game hunter Charles Remington, Michael Douglas, to do the job, kill the Tasvo Man-eaters, that nobody including Col. Patterson can seem to do. ***SPOILER*** Remington who after failing to put down the killer cats with both Col. Patterson and Samuels' help goes out on his own, without Col. Patterson's knowledge, only to end up becoming the Tasvo Man-eaters next victim and meal.Far better then many of it's critics and detractors say it is Ghost and the Darkness does have it's share of shocks and thrills despite not having the benefit, like similar movies like Jaws, of having any real and state of the art special effects. There's only one scene where there's a mechanical or fake lion, like the shark in Jaws, in the movie and that was about the most ineffective scene in which the killer cats attacked in the entire film. The lions are seen mostly in close up when they do most of their damage, attacking and killing the rail workers. But the few scenes where the lions do fully expose themselves, like the dream-like attack on Col. Patterson's wife and son, are truly heart-stopping and as good as anything you'd see a like-wise animal attack film.P.S The notorious Tasvo Lions have been said to have become man-eaters because of an epidemic that killed off most of their food, gazelles zebra and wildebeests, in the area or their hunting grounds. This forced them to go for humans as prey since human beings were the only source of food, with all their normal prey dying out, left open to them. A far more interesting clue, in later checking out their skeletal remains, to the man-eating Tasvo Lions turning to prey on humans has to do with them having abscesses and infections in their teeth and gums. This had the lions suffer extreme and excruciation pain when they had to bite into the extremely thick and tough hides of their normal prey in order to kill and eat them. They turned to hunt kill and eat human beings only because their skin or hides weren't as tough and thus easier to penetrate and not cause the Tasvo Lions any terrible pains in doing so.

It's an exercise I find myself doing every time a movie comes out - especially when the movie is supposedly based on fact.When I saw The Ghost and the Darkness, I had already read the Man-Eating Lions of Tsavo and already seen the lions in the Field Museum. There really were two lions that killed well over 40 workers during the construction of a railroad in Africa in Tsavo, Kenya in the late 1800s. National Geographic also did an article about the aggressive Tsavo lions in 2002. I found the real story fascinating, and was really looking forward to the movie.I understand that the normally maneless lions found in Tsavo don't look quite right for us ignorant viewers (could have just explained it with a one liner from a native, but oh well), so they used lions with manes.I also realize that we as an audience today are too politically correct to cope with the way the white man treated natives back then, so the movie has been historically sanitized, with a few remarks sprinkled throughout on religious reformation from the doctor. I suppose we must continue to pretend certain behaviors in history didn't happen.Yet another key change I'm not clear why we needed another mighty hunter in the story. Patterson had the help of a district manager from time to time, but not another great white hunter. In Africa in that period, getting messages and arranging encounters wasn't easy - strangers of European race were apt to consider each other friends just because they were the same color upon encounter in that era - something the movie fails to get across - it's unlikely that another hunter could be reached easily. And certainly great star/hunter Val could carry a movie on his own. Fortunately the character Michael Douglas plays does not detract from the movie, and there is that extra emphasis on the Ghost/Darkness nomenclature from the (again, additional characters) Masai. Michael Douglas and Val Kilmer did play off each other well, although neither seemed able to fully adopt Southern/Irish (? did we need those?) accents respectively.I do think the hunting scenes in the movie captured well the constant effort to see something, staring into the darkness at nothing, that hunting at night can be like. Not to mention the cold sweat, stark fear, blinding pain, and sudden calm and desperation that a near death experience is.Which is why, in spite of the factual inconsistencies, I gave the movie the rating I did. Worth the watch, if only for that. If you really want to know about the Lions of Tsavo, read the story by Patterson - it's pamphlet #7, published in 1925 from the Field Museum in Chicago.

The 'Ghost' and the 'Darkness' were two cunning man-eating lions in 1898 (I even had a child's encyclopaedia that mentioned them). This is their story.We first meet Col. John Patterson (Val Kilmer), a bridge-building engineer-cum-adventurer, as he discovers that his new boss, the obnoxious Robert Beaumont (Tom Wilkinson from the Full Monty) is a ruthless, self-styled `monster'. `You build bridges, John. You have to go where the rivers are', his enormously understanding pregnant wife tells him, but Patterson's maturity and political nous worries and saddens him over his coming separation with Helena (Emily Mortimer) during her pregnancy; so he's determined to return to her before the birth. What a good husband.But what I like most about this film is its multicultural POV. Clearly the international bridge-building effort (much like Australia's famous Snowy Mountains hydro-electric scheme of the 1950s) provided a modern setting for a very accessible 1990s screenplay. Samuel (John Kani, in beautiful African garb), the camp's liaison officer and `the only man everyone trusts', gives the newly arriving Patterson a succinct overview of the culture clashes in the camp.Abdullah (Om Puri) is the recalcitrant/recidivist Indian foreman. I am disappointed in him for his awful line `Of course; you can do anything because you're white' (such defeatist sarcasm conversely also means that anyone who isn't white is incompetent). Thanks Abdullah-your racist attitudes are bad news for EVERYONE.David Hawthorne (Bernard Hill) is entertaining as the put-upon surgeon. He's coping with an outbreak of malaria, but also an evangelizing lackey of Beaumont's, Angus Starling (Brian McCardie), who is constantly trying to convert everyone to Christianity. The surgeon regularly loses patience with him, for Starling's habitual pestering of the sick (me too! I long for the day when there will be ethical and legal controls on evangelists). Hawthorne is cynical about the whole bridge-building exercise too `This is a sham, who needs it? ...It's only being built to protect the ivory trade'.Realistic thrillers are always more frightening than schlocky rubbish. The chills are begun in earnest by Samuel's accented narration (the accent hints at the added stressor of confusion). Our foreboding of dread is soon represented by waves of African grass, which may serve to hide a stalking lion. At 27mins we see our first devastating lion attack, upon the robust, well-respected African foreman Mahina (Henry Cele). Please steel yourself for the sudden strike as the men sleep in the tent. The scene never fails to shock me; and the terror just gets worse. Samuel's narration deepens our fear, giving us a hint of what the men working on that railroad in 1898 must have felt.Of course, Abdullah The B*st*rd tries to incite a riot, but he is revealed as a liar when, with a gun finally to his own head, he claims `I am a man of peace'. Ha, you're joking, right? Look, I don't mind the workers being fearful; in 3months the lions (the man-eaters don't behave/hunt like any other lions) have killed about 30 men. What I DO mind is some dullard whipping up prejudice and superstition, no doubt, NO DOUBT, for personal gain (whipping up prejudice has ALWAYS been the tool of megalomaniacs, to rally forces behind themselves at the front. You BET it's for personal gain). People like Abdullah belong in jail (what's the bet he already HAD a rap sheet as long as your arm?) ...Anyway, the man who has so cleverly diagnosed the problem is big-game hunter-for-hire, Remington (Michael Douglas). However, Douglas' establishing scene is highly self-serving, as usual the screenplay has him gaining our acceptance at the cost of the doctor's intelligence. Come on, EVERY African surgeon would know all too well the dangers of hospital decay as an irresistible attraction to lions. Those lines were written only for our foreigners', and Douglas' benefits- he was also Co-Exec Producer. Remington's been hired by the big boss to contain and quell any rumours of delay on the railroad.Remington is a pretty good hunter. He's wise enough to employ a rolling band of Masai warriors, and together, they act as the `fixers' of Africa. It's very exciting; I've never seen such a thing before. Unfortunately, every trap they set for the lions fails. When Patterson himself finally freezes during a head-to-head confrontation with one of them, even the Masai decide to leave because they have glimpsed the animals' intelligence, and declared them not lions, but `The Ghost' and `The Darkness'.So Remington and Patterson go out alone, tracking the lions back to their den. Foolishly entering a highly dangerous, enclosed situation, they discover an astonishing sight the lions' den is littered with dozens of old human skeletons. Upon seeing them, Remington declares that these lions hunt for `pleasure'. Well, actually, I say the lions killed people to make them dead, which is just domination. The lions are clever; they've figured out that they need to get rid of the people taking over what used to be theirs, the lions' territory. It's an interspecies pi**ing contest; and Remington is best when he doesn't underestimate his enemy. He likens the lions to two bullies of his childhood, who separately seemed beatable, `but together were lethal'. I agree; it's no good demonizing the animals. Sure, they were not to be underestimated, but had Remington and Patterson agreed with the Masai that `there was not enough blood in all the world that would make these demons stop drinking', they couldn't've stood up to the bullies. And I think that's always true between humans, too.I have to again commend Kilmer for his emotional range in the scene with his wife. I truly felt his elation and humility. He kisses her repeatedly for being clean and untouched by the vicious ugliness that's been his life since he entered Africa. His nightmare(s) about lions stalking his family will no doubt haunt him for a long, long time.I can't fault this movie. 10/10.

I do know that cats are generally more aggressive than dogs towards people (because of their rogue personalities), but these lions are unnaturally ferocious. They are more monster than animal, which is the intended approach of course. Sometimes though it gets a little unbelievable. One scene in particular, involves the cats ambushing a dorm of about two dozen, all are killed. Regardless of their size or ferocity, are we supposed to believe that two lions can kill that many people in thirty seconds flat without one escaping. It's a tent for god sakes. There are a few other problems with The Ghost and the Darkness. Tom Wilkinson's performance is annoying. this is too lame a role for such a good actor.

Patterson and Michael Douglas as Charles Remington. There are some errors in this movie. The movie depicts that possible three lions were attacking the camp at Tsavo at the time. This is not quite true as there were only two, which were killed by Patterson himself. And there's no such character as Charles Remington and it seems like that this was only created for the purpose of the film. There were something like 30,000 Indians brought in by the colonial authorities from the Indian subcontinent but we are shown only a few - in some cases hardly. Thirdly, there's only once scene of the river but the name of the river is never mentioned once in the movie. Lastly, the Masai shown jumping and drinking blood from a cow, it is a tradition which is well shown. However, the jumping of them is not really quite up to it as they are able to jump much higher then shown.Filmed in South Africa and not in Kenya, which was British East Africa, the movie depicts the building of the bridge across the Tsavo river and of the Uganda railway from the coastal town of Mombasa, in Kenya, right through to Uganda. The movie also stars Bollywood actor, who has worked in English movie before, East Is East, Om Puri. It also shows Kilmer in a more serious and in an adventure type role.For these who are interested in African adventures, this is one movie that should not be missed at anytime.

Two bloodthirsty lions feasted on 130 native railroad laborers in Africa in the late 1890s. But it's an adventure tale with more growl than grandeur. Val Kilmer bares a pearly smile in his starring role as idealistic bridge builder Lieutenant Colonel John Patterson. As Patterson, he is assigned by his racist British tycoon boss, Robert Beaumont (Tom Wilkinson) to bridge Africa's Tsavo River within five months. As we learn, the Swahili word for Tsavo translates as a place of slaughter. When Patterson arrives in Africa, his loyal African guide, Samuel (John Kani), warns him that nothing works in Tsavo. No sooner has work started than the lions strike. Patterson guns down one man-eater, but two more lions replace it. The natives call these savage cats The Ghost and the Darkness. Michael Douglas co-stars as savvy lion killer Charles Remington. He arrives on the scene to help save the day, but he doesn't make his appearance until nearly halfway into the action. William Goldman's script errs in not bringing Douglas into the fray much earlier. Although confined to a role that is little more than an over-long cameo, Douglas dominates The Ghost and the Darkness. Douglas' charismatic Remington easily upstages Kilmer's ponderous spit and polish Patterson. Compared to the elegant Patterson, Douglas resembles a shaggy villain from a 1970s era Italian western. Nevertheless, what distinguishes The Ghost and the Darkness are its cagey lions. These lions constantly elude and outwit our pair of heroes. If you saw the Robin Williams movie Jumanji, the special effects here are just as incredible. Director Stephen Hopkins deploys these fantastic digital effects to stage a truly realistic lion attack on a crowd. Many close-up shots of gaping jaws and dark, hypnotic eyes bolster the suspense.An exciting confrontation that sends Kilmer scrambling up a tree with a lion nipping at his heels should get the adrenalin singing in your veins. Altogether, The Ghost and the Darkness succeeds more as a horror movie. The action never strays far from the bridge site so the movie seems rather claustrophobic. When Ghost isn't frightening, it creeps along with one too many campfire scenes. Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid scenarist William Goldman literate script sticks closely to the events of this true-life tragedy. Nevertheless, you wonder how they made the mistakes that they made. Patterson, for example, swaps rifles the night before the big hunt. When he confronts a lion, his gun misfires. The death of one character occurs off-screen, forcing you to fill in the gap and deprive both the audience and the characters with a memorable death scene.You can almost guess which character will be chomped because the filmmakers cast a halo around the person's head. Meanwhile, Hopkins and Goldman devise one genuinely shocking scene but cannot sustain this kind of momentum when the lions are on-screen. Hopkins deserves credit for making these lion attacks fully vicious without emphasizing the blood and gore.

Val Kilmer gives a very quiet but determined air to the role and is supported by excellent performances by John Kani, Om Puri, and Henry Cele, all essential character actors who bring the proper balance of ethnicity and culture to the film. Tom Wilkinson plays Robert Beaumont, a man dedicated to advancing his position to the throne (I care about my Knighthood!), across the backs of the people he assigns the tasks. He is a self described Monster who can either make or break a career, and has no qualms about either. Overall the film is matter of fact and very ordinary, but what cannot be denied is that this happened. I have been to the Field Museum and seen the Lions of Tsavo. It is as the last line of the movie says. If you lock eyes with them, you will be afraid. Lots of gory scenes make this unsuitable for the children, but most teens have seen worse on their video games.

The Remington character always seemed somewhat out of place to me, and when I realized he was just a device added by the writers, for reasons that I still can't fathom, I understood why. Maybe they were afraid Val Kilmer could not carry the movie on his own--frankly, I think he could have with no problem. Maybe it was because Michael Douglas was an executive producer on the film, and wanted to be in the movie.

Every kind of cat has predatory instinct. When you are up against some one big as a lion, the odds are very against you. In the late 1800 its a story based on actual event regarding 2 man eaters of tsavo in Africa, who made a havoc but a great terrifying ordeal among the hearts of African and Indian slaves working under the command of imperial British empire in there. This story reveals when they were constructing a railway line out there 2 adult grown male lions stalked and killed so many of them. The surprising part of the events is that its not only the hunger which drives them berserk. They are doing it for fun and sport. They have a passion for killing humans and than castrating and smashing their corpses. Moreover they knew what traps are awaiting them. Also they know which men are at their trail. They know how to avoid them and what time to openly go head on head with them. Val kilmer starred as Col Jhon Patterson the British officer and engineer in charge of railway line and Michael Douglas Starred as Remington , an adventurer hitch hiker and professional hunter. I believe it was an excellent combination both actors. Both of them are my favorites. Along with them the other combination was of the lions Bongo and Cesar , i really acknowledge their work as a team and co-operation for making of this film. I heard a quote from a movie , When a man and a beast taste each others blood they both become the same thing. Maybe it was the case of lion because the way they were so brutal , no beast can go to that extant. If you watch this film you see in the early minutes of the film that they were not the lions killing people around there. Before them there was a single one killed by col Patterson but he was not that much clever and aggressive , while the most strongest black man was killed by the lions the doctor in charge of the autopsy at 1st couldn't believe that it was a lion's job, he had experience of such fatalities before but not like this one. When Val kilmer and Micheal Douglas joined hands to end their killing spree , the lions changed their strategy of hunting. There fear was so much powerful nobody could even breath properly in that environment. The most terrifying parts are in the movie when they attack the camp in day light killing and half devouring a man also killing the British deputy of Patterson in self defense , than dodging both men and attacking the hospital where patients were being treated. If you watch the movie don't let yourself being hateful towards the big cats. As a matter of fact they have never threatened us so much as we have massacred them and destructed their habitats. Man has proved a far more greatest Nemesis to beasts and even its own kind. I always love and admire the cats of all kinds. I believe they must be protected and conserved as its their right. Well if the film is concerned its going to be classic. A real but wonderful wild life epic.

It is about two man eating lions that plague a construction site of a bridge in Africa. These lions are no ordinary lions, they are vicious man eaters that do not conform to what lions are like. The natives call them demons, and as this is claimed to be a true story, this is biblically possible. But before I go into the theology of this, I wish to look at the movie first.This move is set in Africa at the turn of the century. There is a race with the other European countries, namely Germany, to colonise Africa. A bridge must be built so that the British can move further inland. When Val Kilmer's character first looks at the river he is amazed. He says that the wonder of building bridges is to put land over water. The bridge is also seen as a chain, or a manacle for the river. An unbridged river is an obstacle but a bridge makes this obstacle no more. The bridge tames the land for the river can no longer block the progress of man. But here the land seems to fight back.Right at the beginning, the first lion attacks and is killed with one bullet. Thus Val Kilmer comes out as a hero. Soon after the two lions, the Ghost and the Darkness, come and cause havoc in the campsite. No matter what they do they cannot stop these lions. A great hunter, Remington (Michael Douglas) comes along to help get rid of these lions. He believes them to be simple lions, but when his tribe leaves, he suddenly realises what he is up against. There is a very interesting scene, but to tell you about it would give something away.These lions are considered demons by the natives, and in my mind this is possible. If we look in the Gospels of Matthew, Mark, and Luke, there is the story of the man possessed by the demon legion (he is called legion because he is many). The demon pleads with Christ not to send them back to hell so Christ sends them into a herd of swine. This shows us that demons can manifest themselves in animals as well as in humans. With this in mind, the animal kingdom is not as weak as we make it out to be. These lions were intelligent and would torment their enemies and then turn and indiscriminately kill. If you watch the hospital scene you will note that they kill everybody but do not take anybody away to eat. As Remington says, they do it for the pleasure of it. Even though they are demons, they are still lions, as the swine were still swine. Just because they were possessed did not mean they were unkillable. The soul cannot be destroyed but the body can. The swine ran into the lake and were drowned, the lions were also vulnerable in the same way.This movie comes out as a horror movie, but it is far more than that. There is not ghosts or demons running about, just two lions. The natives call them evil, and that they are, but the movie is real, or so it claims. This really happened and thus can happen to us. A horror movie comes across as being unreal. We can leave a horror movie at the end and be comforted that it is not real. This was. The only comfort we have is that the lions are dead.

Besides the difficult of building this great project he must protect his employees and himself of two dangerous lions who are believed to have killed more than 100 men. The local residents call them as 'The Ghost' and 'The Darkness' because of their great abilities to appear and disappear fast into the woods after killing many of the bridge workers. Patterson is not alone on the hunt of these two lions; he is helped by a notorious American hunter (Michael Douglas) with notable skills on hunting. Both men are trapped in a risky mission and they must run fast because the time is running out and the bridge must be made because England wants to go ahead in the conquest of more African territories surpassing Germany and other European countries. And that bridge must be done no matter what it takes. It is said that this film is based on true events but I still find very difficult to believe in many of the things portrayed here (such as many of the lions attacks or Kilmer facing the lion without shooting and surviving after that). Douglas's character is fictional (read trivia section), created for dramatical purposes and that was great (although many people complain that he was the worst thing in the movie). He really made the movie more watchable than it is, added energy to a story that kept being boring and very slow at times. Considering that The Ghost and The Darkness was written by the great William Goldman I expected a more thrilling movie, with more character and story profundity. I mean, it's just two guys hunting two killing lions in the desert and....? Too much gratuitous and not so fantastic but enjoyable and watchable. The locations were amazing; the main theme score composed by Jerry Goldsmith was brilliant (a little bit wasted, could be used more here or in another film); some of the action scenes were great with the required amount of tension needed but other ones didn't worked at all (many of the attack scenes were unconvincible although real animals were used); the cinematography of Vilmos Zsigmond was good and bad (the day light scenes were very good, he captured great things, but the night scenes was just like the title, too much darkness).

These Lions of Tsavo (prophetically means place of slaughter) were maneless, perhaps due to environmental variables, although maneless lions are not unique to Tsavo. Their taste for man may have been due to an outbreak of Rinderpest at the time, which may have depleted their normal prey. Engineer John Patterson (Val Kilmer) is sent by his chief (Tom Wilkinson) to build a bridge over the Tsavo river . Then the workers become convinced the lions , nicknamed ¨The Ghost¨ and ¨the Darkness¨ are actually demons carrying out a cruel carnage . John sets in pursuit the beasts but he has little luck killing the lions , though he gets to survive on a mixture of cunning and bravura . As the beasts contemptuously evade all traps set for them . After losing dozens of workers to the lions, the company brought in Remington, an American , to hunt them, but even his reputation for being the best could not prevent yet more massacre . There is eventually formed a team between the brave engineer and a famous white hunter (Michael Douglas ,despite having top billing, he doesn't appear on screen until 45 minutes into the movie) but the legendary lions survive to kill and kill again ; as they still seem to have advantage until a frenziedly breathtaking last reel . This nail-biting film packs thrills , chills , grisly events , slurping blood , quick cut edition is used to depict the lions' attacks and terror elements . Based on a true story well screen-written by the notorious writer William Goldman , he took the actual experiences by real Lt. Col. John Henry Patterson published a book about his adventures , titled The Man-Eaters of Tsavo ; however , Michael Douglas' character Remington as a 'great white hunter' is fictionalized , while Val Kilmer's character John Patterson killed both lions . Lt. Col. Patterson owned the skins and skulls of the two Tsavo man-eaters. After the lions were killed, their skins were used as rugs by Patterson. They were later sold In 1924, Patterson sold them to the Field Museum in Chicago for $5,000 . Because they were originally used as rugs with resulting deterioration of the hides, the lions are much smaller than they originally were . There is only one scene involving an animatronic lion , all the other shots were used using two real life lions named Bongo and Caeser ; the same lions also appeared in the film George of the jungle (1997). Very good acting from main cast , and nice support casting . As Val Kilmer is magnificent as an engineer in charge of building a bridge and turned into a relentless hunter . Michael Douglas is top-notch as a two-fisted as well as legendary game hunter with his complex mixture of bravado , toughness and calm . Impressive production design and art design from Stuart Wurtzel and Giles Masters , including wonderful outdoors and a lot of extras . The location where the bridge was built is now called Man-Eater's Junction, after the two lions. It is in Tsavo East National Park, Kenya, about 200 miles southeast of Nairobi . Support actors are frankly engaging such as Tom Wilkinson as Robert Beaumont , John Kani as Samuel , Bernard Hill as Dr. David Hawthorne , Brian McCardie as Angus Starling , Om Puri as Abdullah and Emily Mortimer as wife . Rousing as well as exciting musical score by maestro Jerry Goldsmith . The motion picture was compellingly filmed by Director Stephen Hopkins (Lost in space , Predator 2 , Under suspicion , Blown away) , he wanted his longtime collaborator Peter Levy to be the film's cinematographer, but he was overruled by the studio, who wanted to hire Vilmos Zsigmond who carries out a splendid and colorful cinematography .

A film that holds you tight in its embrace, and a film whose embrace you WANT to remain in. It's an intense, fascinating cinematic experience, one so exciting and oddly beautiful that I am finally ready to call it one of those movies I love most. Hopkins knew what he was doing, and this has to be one of his most underrated works. But then, the number of awards is not what speaks volume about a movie; it's the content, and The Ghost and the Darkness delivers it in volumes. Fourteen years on, only The Edge challenges it in the true fleshing out of terrifying animal personalities.In 1898, Irish Colonel John Patterson is sent to the river Tsavo, Africa, to construct a railroad bridge - forcing him to leave his pregnant wife behind in London. Upon arriving in Africa, Patterson learns of a rampant lion on the loose. He quickly manages to kill it, raising the morale of the workers. This, however, proves to be entirely deceptive. Soon after, two male lions start to prey on the workers - chillingly, they appear to kill for sport rather than food. All efforts to stop them are in vain until hunter Charles Remington arrives to help Patterson rid Tsavo, and the workers, of this threat. But the lions (called the Ghost and the Darkness by the workers) are smart, and disposing of them won't be easy even with Remington in league.This premise is based on a real-life account by John Patterson, and it was practically destined for a movie adaptation. While it is quite true that the movie differentiates on Patterson's account in many ways (Remington is entirely fictional), it's all for the benefit of this film. The actual lions were maneless, yet for the sake of the movie's aesthetics, the fully-maned lions (Bongo and Caesar) strike a more impressive image. The easiness with which the lions kill is also a tad exaggerated, but then, again, the film is all the more suspenseful for it.Quite frankly, I have never seen more beautiful filmwork on lions. The cinematography of this movie is fantastic. One of the scenes in particular - where we first truly see one of the lions kill and eat a worker before our very eyes - is fabulously staged and filmed. In fact, it's one of those movie moments that have edged themselves permanently into my memory - the most artistic, even beautiful piece of animal gore film-making you could find (nothing too queasy). The movie deservedly won an Oscar for Best Sound Editing (the lions's growls, roars and chomps send shivers down my spine for one), and the African-flavoured score by Jerry Goldsmith is wonderful.While it may not be as memorable as the aforementioned, the acting is more than acceptable. John Patterson may be Val Kilmer's most underrated and misunderstood performance; he delivers the role with an understatement that fits the brooding nature of the character. His very subtle Irish accent, possibly heavily affected by a long servitude of Britain, is another trait he gets across very well. Remington is endlessly entertaining and the two characters work together like magic. John Kani and Brian McCardie are both solid as faithful co-leader Samuel and missionary Angus Starling. Emily Mortimer's Helena Patterson cannot be overlooked, either; her few scenes are enough to demonstrate the strong relationship between her husband and her.It's the lions, though, who are the stars. It is about thirty minutes into the film when tG&tD really reels you in. One lion attacks and kills a workman in the middle of the day, in the middle of a group of working men. Patterson and his trusty associates rush to the scene, but by then it's too late. As they approach the lion, the lion is eating the man, viscerally and clearly, before our very eyes. This is a sequence that you would think would make you sick, but, frighteningly, it does the exact opposite. It is an intensely beautiful scene; the lion's roars, chomps and ecstatic growls make me tremble as I watch, glued in my seat. The sequence is hardly over a minute in length, and it's still incredibly strong. The visceral nature of the scene coupled with the lion's intense and undeniable beauty make him the undeniable attraction, even when you learn of the lions' more sinister nature later in the film, which even then is questionable. It's hard for the lions even to emerge as villains, and they remain enigmatic and frightening, yet somehow admirable. Few films have made me as torn about its characters as The Ghost and the Darkness. Starring as the lions are Bongo the lion (RIP) and Caesar, and they do it fantastically, the beautiful beasts they already are.If there is one thing I can criticise, it's the editing. Occasionally, quick shots are shared between two scenes at different points in the film. There are moments when the staging reveals itself to be flawed, in particular the hospital attack scene. The cutting disrupts the continuity and flow of the scene rather than supports it. Also, I think there were sometimes too many close-ups on the lions and not enough middle shots to make us really believe in their size and strength.Despite the savageness, the lions and their attacks are almost sophisticated to behold, and it's perhaps this that's the most thrilling aspect of the film. The Ghost and the Darkness is, on all accounts, a cool film - and there's nothing wrong with that. More than that, though, this is the best enactment of lion attacks you could find in a movie, and I myself have never seen more aesthetic filmwork on lions. Could be a little concrete, but definitely worth a view, for beauty as well as excitement.

Johnny Weissmuller would be proud! THE GHOST IN THE DARKNESS is an old-fashioned jungle adventure flick, the kind that's no longer being made today. It claims to be based on a true story, but even if it's not, THE GHOST AND THE DARKNESS is still a lot of fun. It's exciting, thrilling and often suspenseful. Fact or fiction, this movie is worth a price of admission.Val Kilmer plays Col. Patterson, a brave Englishman who is sent by his greedy investor (Tom Wilkinson) to the wilds of Africa to supervise a long-delayed railroad construction. When he arrives, he discovers the problem. Every night, the workers are attacked by a pair of lions who, unlike most, prefer killing for some sport. Every night, the lions kill a some two or more workers, which results to the lessening of workers. I'll sort it out! says Patterson, as he makes an attempt to stop the lions. After a series of failures, Patterson aids the help of fortune-seeking game hunter Charles Remington (Michael Douglas in top form) to stop the beasts in his old-fashioned but almost successful attempts.The film is simply a land-bound JAWS, complete with its characters and their attempts to stop the beast(/s). There are many of these kind of films, but THE GHOST AND THE DARKNESS are one of the better ones. As a matter of fact, it's actually quite suspenseful. Director Stephen Hopkins knows how to set things up, and delivers immensely. The performances, especially by the two leads are terrific. Somewhere in the film, Douglas' Remington character casts almost the same shadow as Robert Shaw's Quint in JAWS. The script has its dull spots, some are quite silly, but there all part of that grand tradition. The lion attacks could have been more convincing than rug-like things being waved at the camera though. Nevertheless, this is a good film and a taut and expertly handled old-fashioned adventure thriller.Rating **** out of 5.

Hollywood has tried to con us for years with all sorts of bull*** premises based on true events. If I were to believe them then that would mean that I'd have to believe that Gandhi was a saint, and I'd have to believe all the other chewing-gum biographies this fairy-tale-factory Tinseltown has produced over the years.Now, I am no expert on lion behaviour, but I do know that male lions lie around all day and hunt only occasionally. In fact, most of the time their stomachs are so full that they touch the ground! Needless to say, they are lazy bastards (and the females hunt for them mostly), and prefer to take a long, long nap after their dinner is over. Sure, not all lions live in groups, so I am not questioning the reality of two males pairing up and hunting together. But even if we allow for a possibility that the two males are insane, I still find it difficult to believe that they would be willing to hunt every day, and be so super-intelligent and cunning that they get killed only after claiming as many as a hundred victims. This is preposterous; I can accept that they are insane, and I can even allow for the fact that they kill for fun, but they cannot possibly be THIS clever - they are just cats, for chrissakes.Also, this film plays with absurd coincidences a little too much, for my taste. First we have that absurd scene in which three Indians are unable to get a single bullet into a huge lion and at close range - every one of their bullets hits the rods between themselves and the lion. I mean, this is nonsense; it's mathematically possible, but so is winning the lottery three times in a row. Then we have the absurd coincidence that Kilmer's gun (that he switched with the doctor) fails him at just the moment when he is facing one of our invincible lions. To make things sillier, the lion just stands there like a museum piece, instead of immediately attacking Kilmer. Lion attack only dark-coloured people immediately. Lion not attack big superior white man. White man have more luck. White man master of universe and animal kingdom. Lion not sure if to kill white man. Let's also not forget the scene where Kilmer is distracted by an owl (of all things) and drops the gun, just as he is about to shoot the lion after hours of waiting. And to top everything, there is that scene at the end where Kilmer actually manages to outrun the lion and climb a tree - only to be followed by this tree-climbing lion! Lions climb trees?! Since when?? Oh, I forgot this was The Ghost... Or was it The Darkness? I'm not sure... Why the hell does Kilmer outrun the lion, when many before him didn't have any chance whatsoever? Oh, I think I know White man quicker than lion. Colored man slower than lion. Because white man superior in every way. Better hunter. Better shooter. Better runner. Forget coloured man winning sprints at Olympics. It's White man who faster. White man who smarter. Lion respect white man. Lion afraid to catch up with white man in race. Lion pee in pants. Lion afraid. I also don't like the more-or-less (unintentionally?) implied idea that the lives of dozens of people are worth sacrificing for a stupid bridge.Still, the film is never boring, lacks any signs of political correctness, and isn't bad overall.

A great white shark is doing what it does naturally-eat to survive, and humans are taking the fish and leaving it with no choice but to eat humans who leave their natural habitat and go in the water. Asking for it. We have a shark hunter Quint, whose mates were left to die by the US military, and instead of directing his anger at them-he directs it at sharks. This film is in the same vein. You have two lions who we now know were not being maniacs but just seeking to survive. Humans come along and build an unnatural structure-a railroad--which provides them with easy access to a food source.The movie shows some semblance of morality by not making Patterson into the old fashioned big game hunter--but that is what he was. Now let's look at reality. As of 2015, great white sharks are near extinction. Lions also, are dwindling thanks to hunters and loss of habitat. There are more lions in zoos and canned hunting ranches than in the wild.Who are the real monsters? The film presents the lions as if they have the malicious maniacal spirit of humans which is just slanderous and false--not to mention morally obscene given the state of the wilds.Another oddity is that the Muslim and hindu workers are not presented equally. The hindus are anonymous-and made subject of ridicule because of their sacred cow beliefs. The muslims are presented as the sensible ones. Obviously this wouldn't have survived the script stage after 2001. If you want to see real lions and how they are not like humans, check out the 1981 film Roar--which is far more entertaining.

Second, there are certain elements of the story that are just not believable if you are trying to sell this as a true story (e.g. the hospital scene) and I just wish they had stuck more to the book because there was (in my opinion) enough in there to sell as a film. Val Kilmer himself was not particularly interesting and I feel this was poor casting; this was more of a role for Mel Gibson or Kevin Costner.However, there still is a bit to like in the film, Michael Douglas was awesome in his scenery chewing role as the big game hunter and you can tell that she is really enjoying the role. John Kani was good in his role as Samuel and reminded me a bit of Rafiki from The Lion King in that wise adviser role/ comic relief. From a technical stand point, the cinematography was awesome, I know the film was shot in South Africa and they got some really amazing shots. The music (particularly for the intense scenes) was awesome, one of Jerry Goldsmith's best in my opinion.Overall, The Ghost and the Darkness is a mixed bag but overall if you enjoy films like say Jaws then you will probably enjoy this won OK, and that is my overall view of it.

The big scary lions at the center of this thing are filmed very conventionally, lots of closeups of gaping maw, snarling, but nothing unnatural.

John Henry Patterson (Kilmer) has been assigned to build a bridge in Tsavo, Africa, but an already difficult task has been made even worse when lion attacks start happening within the main camp grounds not long after his arrival. Patterson kills a lion they think is responsible for the attacks and so work recommences. Unfortunately, the attacks continue but it soon comes to light that it's not just one lion who's attacking the workers, but two. It's here that a hunter, Charles Remington (Douglas), has been called upon to help track and kill the lions, and so, along with Patterson, the dangerous cat-and-mouse hunt to stop the attacks begin.This film is actually based on real-life events that happened in 1898, and sticks pretty close to the true events as well and the two lions that were responsible for the killings can be seen at the Field Museum of Natural History in Chicago. One of the few parts that isn't true is the character of Charles Remington as he was just written as a part for the movie.The film is actually a pretty enjoyable ride and it has a few good suspenseful moments throughout. Some of the action scenes with the lions do look a tiny bit dated now and you can tell that some of them are super-imposed images, but they are not bad at all and don't ruin the overall effect of the movie.Altogether, the way the lion attacks are done is pretty impressive as it does look as though these two lions are tearing through these people. Some of the scenes are a wee bit intense so a few of the more squeamish audience members may find them a wee bit hard to watch.There's a pretty good cast for the movie too and even though Michael Douglas is a wee bit over-the-top with some of his part, he does a good job, as does Val Kilmer (apart from his Irish accent that is). The movie does get a bit slow in places, but these are pretty few and far between.Overall, this is a very decent movie and even almost 20 years on, is still worth watching.

These two male man eaters hunted together (which is a rarity), and seemed to be killing simply for the sport than hunger. However the creepy thing was that they seemed to have a supernatural ability, to see what traps were laid out for them and find a way around it. Very calculative. Well this is Hollywood's take on the story, as The Ghost and the Darkness (which the native workers labeled the two beasts) is a considerably haunting and hardy old-school colonial undertaking with excellent performances led by a competent Val Kilmer (who beams of respectable confidence as the construction engineer) and Michael Douglas (who pleasurably laps up the role as a scruffy big-game hunter with an memorable entrance).When I was a kid and first saw the movie trailer&#x85; it just stuck with me. I had to see it, and I received it for Christmas (I guess now is a good time to update my VHS copy). Every time I decided to watch it, something just seemed to linger. The hard to believe idea that something like this had happened (well sort of) was terrifying, but hypnotic. Sure they probably sensationalize and added certain elements (like Douglas' character) for the purpose of story-telling, but it's still the notion behind the reasoning that raises the hairs on the back of my neck.Director Stephen Hopkins does a boldly workman-like and laid-back job, not concentrating on stylish flashes (although some visuals of the lions hunting have a certain flair to it; like a hunt in the nighttime mist), but letting the beautiful, but devouring African backdrop open up (like the scenes of the waist high, dry grass fields blowing in the wind caught by dashingly scenic photography) and slowly letting the stalking (or waiting) game unfold with terrorizing pockets of unnerving fear and macabre tension. William Goldman's story falls a bit on the uneven side, tending to be drawn out and recycled, but streaming through the script is some likable humor and a brutally unforgiving imprint that kept me enthralled. The disturbing attacks scenes are blood-stained, with a vicious intensity of adrenaline and blood-thirst, as the hunters become the hunted in a suspenseful struggle. Brave or foolish is what comes to mind. The creature effects mixed with real footage (done by Stan Winston studios) is well pulled off (even with a few niggling inclusions), that just looking into the beast's eyes was unnerving and so were images and sounds of the crunching and tearing of flesh. Music composer Jerry Goldsmith orchestrates an adventurously majestic and soaring arrangement that goes down well. There's sufficient additional support by the likes of John Kani, Bernard Hill, Tom Wilkinson, Brian McCardie and Om Puri.An effectively tailored and transfixing adventure into the darkness of Africa.

Regretfully, the inclusion of fictional characters (the absurd Remington)and events and the re-shaping of Patterson (he was a sergeant at the time, not a colonel) to fit the Hollywood image obscured the real drama and terror of the story. Truth is often stranger than fiction, a fact that seems to elude scriptwriters who, it appears, cannot resist the temptation to improve on the original usually to the detriment of the tale. That was certainly the case with this movie. A potential great which ended up very ordinary.Update 2006 I seldom re-visit comments that I've made on various web-sites but the Ghost & The Darkness recently appeared on my local TV Channel and I was moved to revisit my comments on the IMDb. I was amused to read certain additional reviews from commentators who apparently believe that Hollywood's version of the events at Tsavo, during the latter half of the 19th. Century were/are accurate & true which, if nothing else, illustrates the power of Hollywood to change history. I still cherish the inane comments of one commentator who, apparently, believes that the Remington character really existed and that the (really insignificant) character played by Val (Some-Body-Or-Other) was wasn't really a Sergeant but was 'really' a Colonel (hey, in Hollywood's lexicon) - a Colonel trumps a Sergeant every time!

So it brought back a few powerful memories of Africa. So here it is, the good, the bad, and the ugly.First the good. The imagery and scenery of Africa (Kenya)- although shot in South Africa. The tall grass, the river, a few giraffes, trees, an African village, surrounding mountains. The cinematography is mostly good. That it is based on a true story of the building of the railroad in colonial Africa is also interesting. That there were two ferocious man eating lions that terrorized the builders, and that the engineer was able to kill them is a fascinating story. And the hides can be seen in a Chicago museum.I thought Michael Douglas's role added a lot to the movie, even if his character didn't occur in real life. He just kind of appears out of nowhere with a bunch of Maasai who are ready to hunt the lion. Douglas looks like a wild bush white man. The movie would have been a lot duller without him. The role of the Maasai hunting the lion is fascinating. I lived near Maasai in Tanzania, and this movie portrays some of their rituals which is entertaining and adds some realism.The story of the colonial period, building railroads, Africans and other nationalities, and the dangers and harshness of Africa are intriguing. The story does have an emotional pull to it. The African character adds some sense of authenticity to the movie. There are snippets of the language of Swahili which I know.Now the bad. The movie, like another reviewer said, is filled with clichés. I thought Val Kilmer's character was too neat- too confident, too self assured. His first night in Africa, after doing a drive by of giraffes earlier in the day, and he is already up in a tree shooting a lion with his first shot. The lions, while being based on a real story of two ferocious lions that truly did kill a bunch of people, are portrayed in a Jaws like fashion. I'm an environmental/conservationist. The problem with a movie like Jaws is it falsely portrays all sharks as vicious killers. This movie portrays all lions that way. I read recently that more people are killed taking selfies of themselves than are killed by sharks each year. We all know that lions and sharks are being decimated every year by rampant poaching and killing. So for someone who is knowledgeable about animal biology, the film is mostly rubbish.You won't get much insight into African culture here. There are mostly stereotypes of heroic whites, scared/submissive Africans and Asians, and the portrayal of the nice colonial master is unrealistic.

Suddenly throwing aside Patterson's story and all ties to reality, fictitious character Remington is introduced, horribly portrayed by Michael Douglas. This legendary huntsman is clearly the equivalent of Jaws's Quint, but unfortunately Douglas OTT-acting doesn't even come close to matching Robert Shaw's performance.Despite the movie's obvious ambition to be a Jaws set in Africa (even down to the POV shots of the lions stalking their prey), I think lots of things work well. The ambition to emulate Jaws is at least partly successful, and the movie has some great suspenseful scenes. The extensive use of real lions Caesar and Bongo and very little animatronics means that the predator scenes look great, and I think the film benefits from being made in the mid-nineties with basically no CGI. The scenery (South Africa substituting for Kenya) looks stunning and the film is wonderfully shot, and together with the realistic animal this makes the movie look really good. The acting, apart from Douglas, is also solid with Kilmer being backed up by a strong supporting cast of Tom Wilkinson, Bernard Hill and Emily Mortimer to name a few.Overall, I have a soft spot for monster movies and even though this has many flaws I think it is really entertaining and well worth watching!

It recounts the story of an engineer sent there to build a bridge while at the same time deal with a couple of man-eating lions who are preying on the workforce.The Ghost and the Darkness takes an interesting real story and injects an element of almost supernatural horror into it. These lions are not simply picking off the locals as a means of getting an easy meal; they are in fact killing for fun. Moreover, they live in a cave where they drag back the carcasses of their unfortunate victims. All of this is of course completely unnatural lion behaviour, so it does take the story out of the realms of reality somewhat and plays on the idea that these creatures are inherently evil. The old African myths in which the title of the movie is derived are in actual fact proved to have some basis in explaining the attacks by these mysterious and deadly big cats.The film itself is solid if unremarkable. It follows the basic plot trajectory of Jaws, i.e. unnaturally vicious creature(s) attack local people while an idealistic man tries his best to thwart the danger with the aid of a grizzled hunter. It's all strictly middle-of-the-road with the only real standout aspect to it being its spectacular African setting. Val Kilmer and Michael Douglas are OK but nothing great. The lions are the real stars of the show although even they are only fleetingly presented really. All-in-all this is a passable version of an undeniably interesting real-life horror story.

The film is built on too many clichés. It just seems like with such a story behind it, it could have been so much more, easily. I could take the romantic display of Africa, but the rest of it just didn't pass the test. Michael Douglas, which I've learned to enjoy over the years, really doesn't fit his role in this. Val Kilmer, despite the Irish accent thing, is decent. The African sidekick, or whatever I should call him, is also a bit annoying. First of all the relationship between these three is too cute. Second, I just don't like the way he's supposed to be representative of Africans, with all the mystic bullshit surrounding it. I could go on about how the depiction of Africans and Asians is completely outdated. They all have one thing in common, which is stupidity and fear. With one or two exceptions.My biggest problem with the film is that it in a way asks questions about the actual history of the Tsavo killers without even trying to give an answer. The constant mysticism where the lions are seen as Evil is not impressive. Overall the details were not convincing from a realist point of view.I also missed a little bit of human RAGE in a story about lion massacre.But hey, it's a motion picture where lions are the beasts. Might as well watch it because they don't make too many of these.

Based very loosely on a true story about man-eating lions, the film exaggerates the reality of its source into an epic scale colonial adventure and, come the end no-one in the audience will buy into the theory that this is an accurate account of what actually happened. The historical time frame and the animals behind the killings might be different, but this is essentially yet another variant on the Jaws story. In fact, if you pay close attention you will notice that this film apes the very structure of Jaws with almost indecent closeness. For starters, imagine Robert Shaw in period big game-hunting attire&#133;. and you've got the Michael Douglas character! In 1898 in East Africa, railway engineer John Patterson (Val Kilmer) is working on the construction of an important rail track when his job is interrupted by some gruesome deaths. Seems that two Tsavo lions are, uncharacteristically, terrorising the local rail workers, attacking them with near pre-meditated intent and cunning, before dragging them off to their deaths. Superstitions run high amongst the workers, and the colonialists face the prospect that their rail-road might never be completed unless the lions are killed. But the lions prove difficult to hunt, escaping time after time, adding further fuel to the natives' theory that they are supernatural creatures. After further killings, a big game hunter, Charles Remington (Michael Douglas), arrives on the scene and announces his intention to shoot the lions. Patterson and Remington form an uneasy alliance in their quest to rid the area of the man-eating killers.You'd expect a lot more from a film written by William Goldman, although The Ghost And The Darkness is admittedly exciting in patches and has a certain photographic sweep that makes it continually pleasing to the eye. Goldman himself has commented numerous times that his story was tampered with at several points along the way, losing its original intentions until it becomes little more than a simple-minded, old-fashioned star vehicle for two Hollywood heavyweights. It probably doesn't help that Stephen Hopkins is the appointed director &#150; Hopkins is on surer ground with no-brainer action bonanzas (e.g. Predator 2, Blown Away), and it is as plain as day here that he is happiest during the action scenes. When the film branches into its historical and mystical moments, Hopkins and his cast can make neither head nor tail of what they're doing. Kilmer gets the more interesting role of the two leads and plays it quite well, while Douglas turns up absurdly late in the film and unbalances things somewhat with his loud, brash and frankly hammy display as Remington. As usual, Jerry Goldsmith turns in a sweeping score that adds considerably to the drama. On the whole, The Ghost And The Darkness is watchable (though never particularly original or invigorating) action/adventure fare.

After all, you've seen movie actors calmly stand their ground with rifles and easily shoot wild animals. Well, this movie shows why hunting game can be terrifying. It can be terrifying because the huge pair of lions in this movie are man-eaters who are smarter than the men who hunt them. The lions can move in daylight, can be very close, and yet, you can't see them. The lions give thunderous roars that so terrifies hunters that they freeze or wildly shoot their rifles but can't hit anything as the animals approach. The lions watch and know when a trap is being set for them. The lions don't see men as at the top of the food chain, but just another meal for them. The lions in this movie make the dinosaurs in the Jurassic movies look dumb. And, this movie is based on fact. A young engineer, Val Kilmer, is sent to Africa by a cruel railroad baron to extend a rail line quickly. He is brave, as is the great white hunter, played by Michael Douglas, but both are outwitted over and over again by the lions.

It's also reproduced many places on line, since there is no copyright on it at this point.While certainly based on the true story, The Ghost and the Darkness takes quite a few liberties with it.  In real life, the lions really were incredibly hard to catch and they did kill many people.  But Michael Douglas' character is wholly fictional, as are many events relating to him.  The first contact with the lion, where the big rifle malfunctions, is basically how it happened.  It was a double gun in real life, and Patterson forgot to fire the second barrel.  But I can see why that was left out! The killing of the first lion is overdramatized, but gets the basic idea across. But the events after the death of the first lion are almost all fictional.  I don't see why they had to have a silly fight on the bridge.  In real life, Patterson was sure he nailed #2 with two massive slugs, but after a few days quiet the dead lion came back to life and started killing again.  Patterson and Mahina finally finished it after much difficulty.  In the end they counted six bullet holes in the lion.The film left out the workers' mutiny and attempts to murder Patterson.  I'm not sure why, as it would have made the film more interesting. Overall, Ghost is worth watching, but it's a shame Sillywood had to interfere so much with the true story.

Col J.H. Patterson written in 'The Man-Eaters of Tsavo', which chronicled his efforts to stop the 2 male lions who were killing his workmen.*Some spoilers may follow - I have tried to minimize them*Patterson (Val Kilmer) is a British Army Engineer who is sent by his boss, the arrogant, pompous Robert Beaumont (Tom Wilkinson) to build a railway bridge across the Tsavo river. There is a time deadline as the French and Germans are also building railways, and the British are just ahead. When he reaches Africa he is taken in by some of the most spectacular scenes of animals and landscapes - absolutely terrific cinematography. The building of the bridge begins but not without occasional sightings of a pair of lions creeping around the camps. Patterson manages to kill a lion the first night he spends there, and the workmen are relieved that Patterson has made their lives safer again. Unfortunately, one dead lion DID NOT end the terror. It began that night when Mahina, the foreman(Henry Cele) is pulled from his tent by a lion and dragged out. He is killed, dragged away and eaten. Another death occurs the following night after a man wanders out of his tent and the lion grabs him. Patterson has half the workmen start building thorn and tree-branch fences around the camps to keep the lions out while the other half go to the bridge. While Patterson is reading mail, several screams come up from the camp and Patterson heads towards them. He discovers a big male lion charging through the village, and it overpowers a workman before dragging him out of sight around a building. Patterson follows until he has the lion in sight, when a 2nd roar comes from above. Another big male lion dives down on them, fatally wounding one of his secretaries. The two lions glare menacingly at them (in a sequence that shows them as a pair of very beautiful, handsome creatures)and then disappear into the grass. A 'great white hunter' named Remington is sent to help Patterson, and one plan he has is to build a new hospital - one that should keep the smells of sickness and blood out of the lions attention. They seal up the old hospital as a trap, but the lions pass it by and hit the NEW one! After this, the workmen leave on the first train that passes through Tsavo. They come swarming out in their white robes, carrying their belongings in bags and riding anywhere they can - on top of box cars, clinging to doors, even on the front of the steam engine.Now Patterson and Remington must hunt for the lions alone and with Masai Tribesmen known to Remington. They corner one in a jungle thicket but Patterson's rifle fails and he cannot shoot. In a truly eerie sequence the lion moves toward him, and in the backgrounds are screams of Patterson's men who died at the lion's hands. Remington squeezes off a couple of shots, but the lion escapes. They employ a variety of night-hunting measures including a tall platform which Patterson sits on, but finds himself at the mercy of the approaching lion when an owl makes him lose his balance. After a quick game of cat-and-mouse, Remington kills the first one with a shot in the chest. Patterson wakes that night to see that Remington's tent has collapsed, the inside is a mess and there is blood on the floor. As he heads back to the half-finished bridge he starts shouting, I'm going to SORT IT OUT! I'm going to SORT IT OUT! while firing off his rifle. The lion's roars fall silent for a second, then it appears and a nail-biting chase starts on the bridge, with the lion determined to get its paws on the man who killed its companion.Altogether these lions were known to have killed about 130 people during the time they were killing Patterson's workmen. The movie follows very faithfully the storyline of the book, and recreates some of the workmen's tensions seen in the movie - this is why it seems a little dull for the 1st 30 min. or so. So be patient - it improves as the story carries on.I would highly recommend that people who have seen this read 'The Man-Eaters of Tsavo' by Lt. Col. J.H. Patterson. It was reprinted just after the movie's release so it may still be available. An excellent movie that outdoes most of the horror/suspense flicks today, and as the tagline suggests....'the most incredible parts of the story are true.'

What transpires is a cat-and-mouse game (pun intended) where who is hunted and who is the prey is always in question until the very end.This is a good movie. Don't get me wrong. I watched it again last night for a reason. However, had this story not started with the narrator telling us, ...And no matter how outrageous it seems, all of it is true, it would have been easier to take. That part is not factual. For one --- there is no Michael Douglas character in real-life. When the cover of the poster and DVD cover shows two main characters -- and one of them isn't factual -- yet your narrator says everything we see really happened... You see where I'm going with this. Had they just stated, This is based on a very real, very scary story in the heart of Africa, I would have understood artistic license. Douglas was fascinating as the fictional Remington btw and well worth the addition to the script. Dramatically, the story was enhanced in some very keen ways. Unfortunately, that true story part keeps rearing it's ugly head. Oh well. Minor issues I guess.Overall, this is a very enjoyable movie adapted for the screen. Kilmer is terrific as Patterson (although his Irish (I think?) accent comes and goes at mysterious times). Douglas is mesmerizing as the mercurial Remington. The supporting natives and landscapes are breathtaking and fantastic. Just don't go in with expectations this is the entire true story of The Man-eaters of Tsalvo. You'll have to read the book for the facts. Watch this movie expecting to see a stunning African tale of overcoming terror in the jungle by an unstoppable force of nature and you will be rewarded with a first-class production. Think Jaws in the African plains. It's that terrifying for the natives. 8.5 out of 10 from that perspective. But I rate it a 7 out of 10 simply because it lauds the facts openly and proudly but ignores them for the production. Pretend this is an original, well-written, FICTIONAL screenplay that could possibly happen in real-life (because it did) and enjoy the show. Worth watching for sure.

The project is running behind due to the fears of the Locals and Indians workforce who were attacked and killed by two lions. Val Kilmer (Colonel John Henry Patterson), dashing and brilliant engineer, moved to Africa for a delicate mission overseeing the construction of a railway line from Mombasa to Lake Victoria. Once, Val Kilmer (Colonel John Patterson) arrived, he was welcomed by John Kani (Samuel) who explained him that in general man-eaters never always hunter solitary. On the work site, Patterson is immediately meeting his men killing one bullet a marauding lion. But a few days later, a worker is attacked and torn apart by another cat. This is the beginning of a bloodbath, Om Puri leader of the Indian worker's community asked his members to leave the work site. Two lions, especially cunning, in a few months will kill some thirty workers. The movie contained three different themes The first theme showed a wealth British railroad owner Sir Robert Beaumont who cannot afford his project miss the expected deadline. He threatened to destroy John Patterson reputation if he did accept his proposition to finish the bridge in five months. The second theme is about a young and brilliant Irish engineer John Patterson who tried who all the levels of skills he had to overcome the lion's dilemma. However, he faced some supernatural realities that he never expected to face in his hosted land. The third theme is more relevant about show some mystic beliefs of Africans. When the fighting of the lions took long, they called the Masai warriors recognized for their skills to hunt the animals. During the hunting, John Patterson tried to shoot a lion but his gun misfired without being able to explain the reason that happened. The action of the film implied that the lions were not normal animal but they were external forces. It was difficult to explain to Western citizens that they were not hunting singular animals. The film lighting is mixed of natural and artificial light associated with darkness. This can explained that it was mainly produced in an opened land called savanna where the lions live. The camera provides a low-angle with closed-up shots of the main characters to provide a better view of the characters mood and feelings. Most of the character's costumes are duty and torn by the sunbeams. For the soundtrack it is mixed of Western music, African warrior music like Johannesburg choir or Indian song with the group Jungal Bahar (The Prey Song). The Ghost and the Darkness is a true movie and tells more about the deepness of the African beliefs and its realities than any other film or documentary. There are many unrevealed secrets of African tradition that covered in the movie that people who belong to that community can understand. I watch that movie three times to explore all its aspects. Overall, it is a very good movie to watch.

Even though not all the content is real, the idea as a whole is just shocking, and makes you question reality.The film tells a fictionalized account about the two lions that attacked and killed workers at Tsavo, Kenya during the building of the Uganda-Mombasa Railway in East Africa in 1898. It is put in the perspective of the real life Henry Patterson (who later made a book based on the event) and the fictional Charles Remington, (Michael Douglas).Even though the film is just basically land Jaws, it has a much darker and edgier touch than Jaws. It builds up seeing the lions just as well, though it's quite a bit more gruesome than Jaws, going balls to the wall with gore occasionally. Val Kilmer and Michael Douglas make a great pair, even though Val Kilmer isn't at his best, and Michael Douglas is just playing himself, they're a load of fun to watch.It's a little strangely edited, not badly edited just strangely, like El Mariachi almost. Though I will say it takes a while for the story to get going. He goes to Africa, get acquainted, fiddles around a little. It isn't until half way through the film when Michael Douglas shows up, and that, to me, is when the story really get going, but for a retold story I suppose it gets by. The screenplay by William Goldman mostly works, though some parts felt really out of place, (the lion bully metaphor).I think the lions being called Ghost and Darkness and building them up like supernatural beings was absolutely genius. You really feel the edge when they sneak through the fog like they're invisible. It makes the idea of it being a true story all the more thrilling. At first I forgot that it was a true story because of how well shot the scenes were. You see the lions in the perspective of fear in the eyes of the characters, which probably is because most of the screenplay is based on Henry Patterson's account.It really is a thrill ride. It's way edgier than I thought it was going to be. If you're looking for a survival thriller with a slightly supernatural edge, then look no further, this is one you will never forget!

This time, we've got two seemingly demon possessed lions murdering railroad workers in turn of the century Uganda.

When the murderous lions in question begin terrorizing&#x97;and maiming&#x97;John's workers, something's got to be done (especially when they all flee at the suspicion that he's brought about a curse on the area). Cue the entrance of Charles Remington (Michael Douglas), a world- renowned hunter who's the embodiment of the old-school, no-holds-barred, shotgun-toting, Hemingway-esque man's man.Director Stephen Hopkins decides the go the route of Jaws, as it's rare that we're given a clean, full frame shot of the monsters. This turns out to be a great decision, as it adds to the suspense when we see a silhouette (or think we see one) moving stealthily among the rippling, waist high savanna. In that regard, there's no denying that The Ghost and the Darkness delivers the goods in the suspense department.Unfortunately, the film does have its problems. First and foremost is the entirely too abrupt conclusion, which, quite honestly, feels sloppy and rushed. After all we've been through with Patterson and Remington, one would expect a grand finale that heightens the tension to unbearable levels. Instead we get something like a watered down version of the velociraptor kitchen scene in Jurassic Park.There's also the lack of satisfaction that could have been delivered if the one person we truly despise in the story got what he had coming to him. Spontenaity is a good thing, but all I could think about as the final act unfolded was how badly I hoped that the greedy businessman would finally come in contact with a beast infinitely more malicious than himself.Then there's the music, which alternates between stirring and grating. Particularly annoying is the decision to work some sort of elephant/hyena noise into what would be an otherwise memorable score.If it weren't for the final half hour and the previously mentioned sub- par musical renderings, it'd be safe to call The Ghost and the Darkness an underrated thriller. Instead it fizzles into a flabby shadow of its former self, much like a long coveted balloon that's held on until there's simply nothing left.

It's often quite exciting, offering very graphic and frightening depictions of some of the lion attacks that occur, and offering a bit of a glimpse at conditions in Africa at the turn of the century, and especially some of the racial divisions that existed between whites, blacks and Indians. There's some nice scenery featuring African landscapes and wildlife shots, and there's an extended period near the beginning of the movie that seems to be little more than a survey of African wildlife, with information about the different animals being offered in almost narrative format by Patterson. Mind you, there are also some extended periods in the movie when nothing much happens. It tries to draw the viewer in right from the beginning by claiming that everything that's depicted actually happens - except that if you've done any research on the history of the Tsavo lion attacks, you know that big parts of that claim are simply untrue - the biggest bit of creative licence being the creation of the Remington character - an American big game hunter played by Michael Douglas.There was no Remington - so why create him? The character didn't appeal to me all that much, so I wasn't at all sure why writer William Goldman decided to add him to the story. The history itself is interesting enough. Patterson was real, and he really was an engineer building a bridge over the Tsavo River in Kenya. There really were a number of the workers who were killed by a pair of man-eating lions, who really did have to be hunted down, and who really are now on display at the Field Musem in Chicago. In real life, though, Patterson (played in the movie by Val Kilmer) did the hunting. No famous big-game hunter was brought in; the character of Remington was a total fabrication - and, frankly, an unnecessary one that really detracts from the overall credibility of the movie. The real story of the camp and the hunt by Patterson would have been exciting enough (and probably even more exciting than this, since it would have been much more firmly grounded in reality.) As far as I'm concerned, the presence of the Remington character throws this movie off completely.

Supporting roles completed the film very well with Om Puri, Tom Wilkinson, Bernard Hill, & native African John Kani. The film takes place in Africa's Uganda, with the Tsavo River cutting through it. British Army Colonel & engineer John Henry Patterson(Kilmer)is called upon by nasty millionaire developer Robert Beaumont(Wilkinson) to build a bridge over the Tsavo River for the railroad. Patterson agrees & travels to Uganda to begin work. Patterson is greeted by native Ugandan guide & assistant Samuel(Kani) who helps him with the workers, etc.. The bridge & rail workers consist of Ugandans & East Indian men who along with coping with racial tension amongst each other but also must contend with a dangerous lion infiltrating the camp. Determined to keep his deadline, Patterson guns down the lion & gains the respect of his peers. All appears well when the attacks start again with grisly results. Workers are attacked both during the day & at night to Patterson's dismay. Patterson tries various methods to trap and/or kill the lion to no avail. Patterson soon discovers there is more than just a single lion; two very large & bloodthirsty lions are brothers & on the prowl. The ferocity & swiftness with which the lions demonstrate gain them the dub by locals as The Ghost & the Darkness. The killings go on with Patterson having both a worker strike & a reluctant visit from Beaumont. After surveying the situation, Beaumont calls in veteran big game hunter Charles Remington to kill the lions. Once arrived, Remington takes over the hunt with no success. Remington & Patterson become friends & collaborate to trap & kill the lions. A plan is made with Remington, Patterson, & a nervous Samuel prepared to do battle with the vicious lions. They are successful in killing one of the lions, with one left still to deal with. After an unsuccessful try, Remington & Patterson find the lions' lair which contains the bones of many, many past kills in a vast heap. These lions were not killing not for food but for sport or the thrill of killing. After a night of boozing & cavorting, Remington is attacked in his tent & savagely killed by the lone lion. Angry & desperate, Patterson goes after the killer lion. In the end, Patterson triumphs by shooting the lion while being charged. Patterson completes his mission with the bridge & railroad in place & rid the town of Tsavo of the dreaded Ghost & the Darkness.I enjoyed this film quite a bit & have no problem seeing it time & again.

The only blot in the copybook is the curious mis-casting of Michael Douglas, who is frankly embarrassing at times as the brooding, lethal white hunter. This is all the more curious because the character of Remington is, as far as I can tell, completely fictional. He is not mentioned in Patterson's book The Lions of Savo, nor does his name show up in any of the accounts I've read. It seems as though the makers had to find a role for Douglas and ending up shrugging their shoulders and, with a muttered what-the-hell, created Remington.There are many historical inaccuracies, including the painful fact that Patterson was really not a likable individual (in reality, he treated his wife abominably She ended her days in a mental institution) but I don't suppose that one goes to the movies to be educated. The entertainment is here, and it is of a high quality. The relationship between the four dissimilar men --Patterson, Samuel, Angus Starling and the doctor-- provides an intelligent undercurrent of tension to the main theme of the hunt, and the dialog often succeeds in being witty and pointed. Certainly, the action is exciting, novel and usually compelling.Despite its flaws, factual and other, this is a fine film that is worth seeing and re-seeing. William Goldman shows once again why he is a highly regarded screenwriter, and I have never understood why Val Kilmer, who consistently gives fine performances in a variety of roles, isn't among the top two or three screen leading men.

Still, it could have been better.  I know that someone pretty much inevitably says that about any film, but in this case it's the basic story that could have been better  and -- even though the screenplay was based on true incidents -- my contention is that the proceedings could have been improved through LESS  dramatization.My saying that the story could have been better feels just a tad sacrilegious -- after all, the great William Goldman wrote the screenplay.  Yea, the man is a veritable god among screenwriters, being the force behind several of the best films ever made (including the magnificent Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid), and he knows how to tell a compelling story, usually while keeping the progress of that story tight and focused.  Ghost and the Darkness is no exception, and is well-written, but in this case the actual events were arguably more compelling than the Hollywood version and would quite probably have made for a much better movie with only minor adjustments necessary to smooth the narrative.**Possible 'spoilers' follow**For one thing, there was no Remington.  Inclusion of Michael Douglas' character implies a rather liberal interpretation of just how closely this film is based on a true story (especially given John Kani's ominous voiceover attesting that the film's events are all true).  Yes, I think that Mr Douglas is a great actor and creative talent and probably quite a dude, but the Remington character was a somewhat jarring intrusion and even moreso when you know that there was no such man in reality.  The Remington role is more or less superfluous to the film, even, given that it's Patterson (a heroic name, of course) who really does all of the hero work when you come down to it.  I believe that the film would have been even more powerful had it been more completely along the lines of a vendetta between Patterson and the Simbas-from-Heck -- as it stands, there's an element of that but Remington kind of muddles the dynamic and makes for a far less streamlined progression of the story.  In other words, Remington's character was an unnecessary intrusion that detracted from the story's pacing, diluted the powerful Patterson-vs-demon-lion plot, and irrevocably distanced the story from being true to real events.On the other hand, Michael Douglas did a good job (though his American hero role seemed particularly jarring and perhaps even anachronistic in the context of the film's progression before hi arrival) and the dynamic between he and Kilmer was good, as was the fictionalized ending.  Still, it's a pity that Kilmer wasn't left to carry the film, as in reality, with his quieter and more introspective character providing a sort of everyman-who-does- what-he-has-to-do quality to the film.  I think that this approach would have been much more dramatic and effective, but I guess that someone felt it necessary to insert Michael Douglas' larger- than-life American to cater to the next-to-lowest common denominator.Other historical inaccuracies were fairly minor, relegated largely to telescoping of characters and time-shifting of actual events (e.g., the discovery of the lions' cave), though one of the most obvious was that the actual killer lions of Tsavo were maneless males, the maneless condition for some reason being endemic to many lions of that part of Kenya.  No big deal, really, especially given that the maned lion is far more fearsome-looking on screen.  Also, as far as I can tell, there's no mention in the film (or in pre-credits end text) of the lions having killed somewhere between about 130 and 140-plus railway workers, a pretty staggering figure that's basically instant shock value in itself (though a later maneater in India, the Champawat Tigress, was claimed to have killed 436 people before being shot by a famous hunter...now THERE is your Michael Douglas character).I rate the film highly as it is but it's a pity that the most excellent William Goldman didn't remain more true to reality.  Then again, the same's true to an even greater extent of his take on the Butch and Sundance story, but that didn't stop that film from being one of the very best ever made.

It's great to see Val able to give a character such depth and feeling which in most of his movies hasn't been possible.  It is a crime that Michael Douglas is billed first in the cast list - it seems however good Val is, he is never given credit for it.  As for Douglas, he was okay I guess, but I generally thought he ruined the dark tone of the movie after it was going so well (what was a would-be American cowboy doing in the African plains?)Perhaps 'The Ghost and the Darkness' is not so entirely original - for me it bears a slight resemblance to the 1990 film 'Mountains of the Moon' and sometimes even 'Zulu'.  Some characters, particularly Tom Wilkinson, are somewhat stereotyped - the mean, cowardly and unsympathetic English 'baddy' which we've seen so many times before.  The script is not great either, but this does not spoil the mood of the action.  After all, when stuck face-to-face with a roaring lion, you are unlikely to recite Shakespeare!  However, there was some typical-Douglas wishy-washy sentimental tosh in there which I thought was unnecessary.  Also, Val Kilmer and Emily Mortimer do not make a very believable couple.This aside, I found it a greatly enjoyable and moving film.  I recommend this to anyone who enjoys serious action-adventure and of course any fans of Val...  Perhaps animal-rights activists should stay clear though! 6/10 "},{"Title":"Grrrrrrrrrrreat!","Date":"17 April 2002","Score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Adventure, Drama, Horror","Review":"  I remember seeing The Ghost and The Darkness when it hit UK Sky back in 1998 but decided to give it a second bash as it hits UK Terrestrial TV (ITV).

Sometimes history makes up a story far weirder than anything some third-rate Hollywood author could  write up. Just the way it is, lets face it.The story gives adequate information for the reasons of the main characters to be there, their relevant motivations and the times they live in. No more, no less. Still, one should remember that this is a movie about the menace of two lions, not about planting coffee in Africa, an emotional drama before a beautiful backdrop or the exploration of the dark depths of the human character. If that's what you are looking for, sorry, its the wrong movie ! Go watch Woodie Allen pieces ( which have their place and time ) !As for the movie, great photography, impressive settings , adequate to great actors ( I am not a great Val Kilmer fan myself, but he fills the Col. Patterson part just fine )and a very good soundtrack. Actually, the sheer natural beauty and the exotic location make the unfolding horror of the lions stalking and butchering the railroad workers, sidekicks and protagonists alike even more menacing than it would be on sunny US-shores (as in Jaws ) - something dark, primal and unknown enters the story with their first killing, something that seems as much a natural part of the location as the incredible beauty of the land. It never gets explained with some bogus 'McGuffin', it just exists ( no radiation/toxic hazard, whatsoever nonsense ). Two maneating, clever and aberrant lions. Should do....Compared to 'Jaws', and its many terrible ripoffs, copycats and look-alikes, this is the far superior movie - better even than 'Jaws' ( which was innovative, though, and which I like ) due to its skillful crafting, building of a menacing presence and less reliance on sudden shocks to get the audience's interest. You always know the lions are stalking the camp, you just do not know where, how and when they will strike. There is no easy safety on shore , which I find much more entertaining and interesting than being 'shock-awakened' by some blaring soundeffects and sudden gore and splattering - actually much of the violence here is off-camera or alleged too, and while there is a lot of blood in some scenes, you rarely if ever see its actual shedding. While I like it, this might not appeal to the gore-hounds though , I presume.In the end 'The Ghost And The Darkness' combines two genres, the great adventure story, and the stalking monster plot, forging both into a greater, very engrossing whole. I give it 8,5 out of 10 for sheer entertainment value.  And as for many 'critics', I guess there were just not enough scantily clad, busty females (preferably helpless, blonde and screaming ) and too little predictability about the next victim in this movie for their taste.....

This was a real life event that could have been turned into a superb movie but it was turned into trash in the movie In the shadow of Kiliminjaro.

He did not enter the picture for almost the first hour of it and then, the story still seemed to focus on Kilmer's character and his problems.As far as theatrical value goes, this is an excellent movie!  The characters meshed with each other in a way that kept you in the story.

Set in the late nineteenth century, it's the story Colonel John Henry Patterson (Val Kilmer) man hired to supervise the building of a bridge in British-colonial Africa.  Upon arriving in Africa, Patterson learns that the bridge must be built within five months &#150; his supervisor (and the man formerly in charge of building the bridge), Beaumont (Tom Wilkinson), has set this unreasonable deadline just so Patterson will fail. Undaunted by this challenge, Patterson pushes on, and actually enjoys a slight amount of success, until some native workers are mauled to death by a lion. The native workers believe that the lion is a spirit sent to punish the British, but Patterson believe that the lion is just an old male lion that has been kicked out of its pride, left to die of old age. To shut the natives, up, Patterson hires one of the greatest game hunters living in Africa, Charles Remington (Michael Douglas), to kill the beast.  Remington hunts down the lion, but finds that he's not after one decrepit old lion, but two young, vicious male lions that hunt as a team.  A game of hunter versus hunted ensues between Remington, Patterson, and the killer lions, and the twists and turns that ensue are often quite entertaining.Unfortunately, the movie is usually only interesting when the lions are present.  The first third of the movie, setting up the conflict between man and beast, drags along at a painfully slow rate. Val Kilmer is woefully miscast as Patterson, coming across as spoiled and ineffective instead of as a man desperately struggling against the odds. Michael Douglas' performance as Remington, while entertaining, was cartoonish and out of place with the rest of the film.  The character of Remington would've benefited greatly from either being toned down or from a reduction in screen time.Ultimately, the lions are the true stars of the film.  The scenes where they attack, or where Remington and Patterson are forced to prepare for an attack, are gritty and suspenseful.  The animatronic lions created by Stan Winston are unbelievably good &#150; watching their eyes focus on their prey in the African twilight is chilling, to say the least.  Also, once the lions had been established as a real threat, they could be used to create menace in a scene without even being there.  But the lions are supposed to be the villains, not the whole movie, and as such `The Ghost and the Darkness' fails miserably.There's a few scenes that are fantastic, but for the most part, this film's a boring mess.

The culprits responsible were a pair of man-eating Tsavo lions, supposedly no longer able to hunt their normal prey because of a Rinderpest epidemic, who began dragging off workers from their tents in the night. The Irish colonel/engineer in charge of the construction, John H. Patterson, took it under his wing to purge Tsavo of the man-eaters. Following his experiences in Africa, Patterson wrote a compelling book (I have read segments of it) that was later the basis for two movies. The first was Bwana Devil the first 3D movie, released in the 1950s. The latter was The Ghost and the Darkness and not only fails at being a good transfer from paper to screen, but also at being a delectable adventure story.The Ghost and the Darkness, from start to finish, has a list of problems the length of Michael Douglas's hair in the film. I will touch on a great many of the problems and qualms that I had during my review. But here is the core mistake that screenwriter William Goldman and director Stephan Hopkins made. The movie is written and directed with the intention of being brutal, sober, and solemn. Yet the way its highly fictionalized plot is constructed, it generates the impression of a silly satire. Why? Because there are so many darn implausible moments and plot holes that not even a great director could mask from the audience. As a result, The Ghost and the Darkness seems very confused as to what it's doing and where it's trying to go. It almost comes across as affronting to one's own logic.I think that was the attitude that the movie's stars Val Kilmer and Michael Douglas were associated with during the making of this dissatisfying project. Kilmer, before so lively and enthusiastic, seems uncharacteristically morose and unhappy. He puts up a modest effort, but one can feel his feeling of being out-of-place in a hack screenplay. He's forced to say things like Hippos fart through their mouths. I guess they don't kiss very much. I know, it was intended by Mr. Goldman to be funny, but Kilmer seemed to realize while muttering it that it would not fly with the audience. Michael Douglas seems even more out of place and unconvincing as a legendary big game hunter (completely fictional, not associated with the true story) whose character is yet another hack-job rip-off of Robert Shaw's shark fisherman in Jaws. Furthermore, Douglas cannot pass as a game hunter, for he looks more like a deadbeat wearing ten-year-old clothes and who never heard of a shaving razor. There is no real conviction from their performances and that is because they realize there is no conviction in the way their parts are written. When any character comes and goes, the effect is nonexistent.When the movie opens, we're treated with some unintentional laughs because of the cornball dialogue. Now one would expect one of two things to happen with the lion attacks. Either they would ante the movie, or make it even funnier than it already is. No. This adds again to the picture's identity crisis. The convincing attacks are so preposterous and over-the-top that they sort of drag the movie down even further. Funny as it sounds, the movie might have actually benefited if there had been no lions in it at all, for they detract from the picture, not add to it. The attack sequences are poorly constructed, oftentimes with a silhouetted lion just running past the camera in front of a victim and then having close-ups of a phony lion head with its jaws locked around the actor's torso. There are some commendable shots with a real lion, but overall, these attacks are ludicrous in a bad way. Regarding the climaxes, they are essentially just carbon copies with a few changes, like coffee stains and holes. The holes are key shots which are apparently missing, leaving the audience feeling rather restless and unsatisfied.In fact, the whole movie is ludicrous in a bad way. For the way it asks you accept one preposterous moment after another is almost insulting to your mind's capacity. Take for example, this situation. If you were to come upon the den of these two ferocious man-eaters, how would you respond? You have two choices. You can either wait outside the cave entrance with your rifles pointed ahead, or you can stupidly wander into the darkness-cloaked cave. What would you do? What do the characters end up doing? You do the math. Could you honestly expect to construct a (lion-proof) hospital big enough for fifty people in a twenty-four-hour period? And I don't know who in the heck talked a hunter into constructing a twenty-foot-high platform where the only thing keeping you from falling is a slat of wood the width of your crotch. I'm almost tempted to give away the denouement of this sequence. All I will tell you is that it involves a lion, a baboon, and a bird. Also that if I'd seen this particular sequence alone, I would have laughed my head off. But having to watch it with movie in front and after it, this sequence is groan-inducing.Now the story of the Tsavo man-eaters is so fundamentally compelling and primal that it deserves to be told on-screen. But one will find more entertainment reading Patterson's book than watching The Ghost and the Darkness. It is slapstick disguised as a serious African adventure yarn. Sure, there are a few moments of wonder when we first see the continent and some laugh-worthy moments, but over all this is a rather cheap and unforgivable production. And the late Jerry Goldsmith accomplished here what I thought was impossible for him an unmemorable and sometimes unpleasant musical score.

A predictive and very childish kind of storyline, somewhat like bedtime stories to make children brave, which could have been done by a short 5 minutes story.Directed by Stephen Hopkins and Written By William Godman, this film is all about a character John Patterson an engineer, a bridge builder to be specific, who is the protagonist of the story, who takes a challenge of building a bridge in Africa, very confidently and with his wife pregnant and delivering a baby in six months. The job was assigned by a very rude and demotivating boss. The story moves around building of the bridge and some man-eater lions which created fear in the mind of people working there. And at the end of the movie, as one can predict, the hero killed the lions and thank god, the movie was over!!Despite a bad story, the direction is good. The background music is so real, that it creates such a superb horror effect in the mind of people that even if the movie was over you will feel the lions coming after you!! All the characters acted well, especially the hero.The best part of the movie which i liked the most was; cultural relations have been very beautiful shown in this movie, i.e. how to live and co-operate with people who are not like you.So the final verdict of the movie goes as, it's better to watch 'Man verses wild' on National Geographical than to waste time as well money in cinema hall.

Patterson is trying to build a large bridge for the British Railway, leading a large group of Africans and Indians. He has a strict deadline, but is known for always getting the job done. However, the attack of two lions in the area puts great fear into the workers, and over 100 are killed. Patterson comes up with several plans to catch and kill the lions so that he can continue with his work, as the locals are planning to leave, believing the lions to be pure evil, calling them the ghost and the darkness according to a legend. They begin to lose confidence in Patterson as they only attacked when he arrived. The lions seem unusually clever and vicious, and Patterson is out of his league. Enter Remington, straight out of a Haggard novel, an aging hunter who his renowned for his ability. Along with a friend Samuel, they go hunting.The film deliberately tries to move at a slower pace than films of this type, but unfortunately it does not work. No real tension is created, and Kilmer's Patterson always seems to have a smile on his face in spite of the death around him. For a cast of good actors, no-one particularly performs well, Kilmer is guilty of an awful accent, and Douglas is basically the same character as he played in Romancing the Stone, but without the wise-cracks. Until Douglas appears, there is little excitement, and the banter between characters, obviously trying to recall Jaws, is vastly inferior to Spielberg's hit. However, there are a few decent moments, even if everything is immediately predictable, and at least the lions have not totally been butchered by Mr. CGI. The final hunt scenes are pretty good, but the film should have been shorter to increase their impact. Based on a true story with the usual changes to suit the 'modern' audience, which hardly harm the story, The Ghost and the Darkness is worth watching if there is nothing on TV, but I would not recommend going out of your way to buy or see it.6 out of 10 "},{"Title":"True story of a pair of man eaters","Date":"20 March 2005","Score":"0 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Adventure, Drama, Horror","Review":" And I don't mean Paris Hilton and Nicole Richie.

Of course being an adaptation some things are changed. For one the real lions were maneless males, here they are regular maned lions. Also, and most glaringly, Micheal Douglass's character Remmington never existed. These are easy to ignore when the film is as interesting as this however.

It just goes to show that with low expectations, you are much more likely to be pleasantly surprised.By no means does this film deserve a bashing.  It's well-directed and photographed throughout, with some stunning African sunsets and also a brilliantly stirring score from Jerry Goldsmith.Val Kilmer, I personally love the guy (maybe not for all the right reasons) but once again here he proved that he is a very fine actor.  Val has never looked better, and his Irish accent was, I believe, not at all bad.  He didn't over-do it which is why I think his performance so lifted the movie.  It's great to see Val able to give a character such depth and feeling which in most of his movies hasn't been possible.  It is a crime that Michael Douglas is billed first in the cast list - it seems however good Val is, he is never given credit for it.  As for Douglas, he was okay I guess, but I generally thought he ruined the dark tone of the movie after it was going so well (what was a would-be American cowboy doing in the African plains?)Perhaps 'The Ghost and the Darkness' is not so entirely original - for me it bears a slight resemblance to the 1960 film 'Mountains of the Moon' and sometimes even 'Zulu'.  Some characters, particularly Tom Wilkinson, are somewhat stereotyped - the mean, cowardly and unsympathetic English 'baddy' which we've seen so many times before.  The script is not great either, but this does not spoil the mood of the action.  After all, when stuck face-to-face with a roaring lion, you are unlikely to recite Shakespeare!  However, there was some typical-Douglas wishy-washy sentimental tosh in there which I thought was unnecessary.  Also, Val Kilmer and Emily Mortimer do not make a very believable couple.This aside, I found it a greatly enjoyable and moving film.

Even the novel The Man-Eaters of Tsavo, which was originally written in 1907 by its protagonist J.H. Patterson, completely gets re-styled and altered to fit the successful Jaws formula. Basically this means there are quite a bit of chaotic and allegedly menacing POV-shots and a bunch of dreadful stereotypes amongst the characters; like the ruthless capitalist (Tom Wilkinson) and the indifferent cowboy-like hunter (Michael Douglas). By that I certainly don't intend to say that The Ghost and the Darkness is a bad movie. On the contrary, it's one of the better 90's action/adventure movies out there, with multiple moments of genuine tension and some of the most astonishing wildlife footage ever shown in an American produced film. The successful young engineer John Patterson is sent to Tsavo in Kenya (although back then it wasn't yet known as Kenya yet) to design and build a railroad bridge, so that the British remain ahead of the French and Dutch in their colonial progress. The project quickly becomes stalled when two enormous lions decide to prowl the area and attack the workers. The animals, referred to by the superstitious construction workers as the Ghost and the Darkness, behave very much unlike lions normally behave, however. They work in pair, they attack in broad daylight and they seemingly kill for pleasure! Since this part of the plot is reportedly based on true events, that's indeed quite remarkable and deeply disturbing! The body count soon mounts up to over a hundred, and Patterson receives the help of the notorious and slightly eccentric hunter Charles Remington. The Ghost and the Darkness is an overall worthwhile popcorn flick in which the dull moments and clichéd situations get sufficiently compensated with beautiful images and thrilling action stunts. Jerry Goldsmith's music is phenomenal and Vilmos Zsigmond's camera-work is terrific. In fact, these two gentlemen are the true real stars of the film. Michael Douglas obviously enjoyed playing the cool Remington character and there are good supporting performances for Tom Wilkinson, Bernard Hill and Om Puri.

Upon arrival Patterson is greeted by his assistant Angus Starling (Brian McCardie) who takes him to the construction site to meet the tribal workers foremen Samuel (John Kani) & Abdullah (Om Puri) plus Dr. Hawthorne (Bernard Hill) at the site hospital who shows him a man who was attacked by a lion earlier in the day. Patterson says he will sort it out & that night kills what he thinks is the lion responsible. It's now 'Seven Weeks Later' & the bridge is coming along fine until one night a worker is taken & killed by a lion, the workers call the lion 'the ghost and the darkness' & consider them evil spirits. As more workers are taken & killed all attempts to kill the lion fails, it soon becomes clear that there are in fact two lions & before long over 40 men have fallen prey to them. To try & kill the lions world famous big game hunter Charles Remington (Michael Douglas) is hired to put an end to their killing spree for good...Directed by Stephen Hopkins I thought The Ghost and the Darkness was an OK time waster at best, dull Hollywood nonsense at worst. The script by William Goldman is apparently based on a true story of which I have no doubt but what I do doubt is how accurate this adaptation actually is, I wouldn't be surprised if a bit of exaggeration went on if you know what I mean. The Ghost and the Darkness almost exclusively concentrates on the lion aspect of the story & completely ignores the bridge building part except when the workers start to get scared & leave. It's a relatively slow film, the lion attacks had little impact as far as I was concerned because of director Hopkins use of annoying quick cuts which I think just end up looking like a jumbled up mess of unrecognisable imagery. None of the attacks are graphic & the majority of The Ghost and the Drakness focuses on Pattersons attempts to kill the lions with various plans which becomes boring, Remington isn't introduced until past the 40 minute mark & brings little to the film except instead of one person hunting the lions there's now two. Having said that the film provides a fair amount of entertainment & I wasn't too bored but at the same time I wasn't particularly gripped either, at least it kept me watching & fairly interested for 110 odd minutes. With a large budget of about $55,000,000 The Ghost and the Darkness is a bit of a disappointment, I would suspect a large amount of that money went on Kilmer & Douglas's wages, another sizable chunk on the location filming in Africa, the period setting & the dozens of extras used. Personally I found the look of the film really dull & all that detail in costumes & location sets had little impact on me, I found The Ghost and the Darkness a visually bland & unexciting film. The acting was OK but nothing special, the normally likable Douglas looks uninterested & makes what is really a glorified cameo despite his top-billing in the credits. Overall The Ghost and the Darkness is a decent watch but don't expect an action packed film or one that will stay with you very long.

I watched this yesterday on TV and thought I'd entertain the film for a short while to see a)how bad Val Kilmer's acting was going to be and b)because I quite like Michael Douglas who doesn't tend to put his name to that many bad films. I was pleasantly surprised.The opening few scenes with Kilmer are pretty bad, the acting is so wooden and stilted it's like watching children in a nativity play. However once the action moves to Africa things get much better. The premise is Kilmer is charged with overseeing the construction of a railway crossing in East Africa in the late 19th Century, his reputation is that of efficiency and vows to complete the task on time and on budget to make it back in time to see the birth of his first child. What really hooked me was the first lion attack (of which there are many), which is really scary and takes you by surprise at how vivid it is. From there on in the film pretty much follows the same path as Spielburg's shark classic, with individuals slowly being picked off as we gradually find out more about the two Lions on the killing spree. Hell, they even use music similar to the 'dur dum' of the watery shark shocker.Douglas doesn't appear until someway into the film and plays the great white hunter character. Looking not dissimilar to how he does in the 'Romancing the Stone' movies he plays the part of Robert Shaw in Jaws - the gnarly seen it all before sailor or in this case hunter. Kilmer is of course playing the role of Roy Scheider, the reluctant hero trying to protect his family and his workers. The climax too is straight out of Jaws, although instead of sailing off to find the shark everyone working on the rail-crossing flees in fear leaving just Kilmer, Douglas and Kilmer's right hand man for the final face-off. I swear I was half expecting Kilmer to say at one point we're gonna need a bigger cow (as bait).This movie was surprisingly good and after a shaky start picks up and becomes a decent watchable movie.

Michael Douglas co-produced this film.No doubt historical facts imply that some elements of the plot are true, but those who laughed when the shark jumps onto the boat and shows director-willed knowledge of the plans made to kill it will enjoy the broken wood, the not-close-to-impossible action scenes, the super-human knowledge of animals... Hysterically funny.The ideological and political stand is much more disturbing. We only saw worse with fascist and pro-colonisation Tarzan (featuring the natural ability of white men to lead and bring order and civilisation as was the idea of Edgar Rice Burroughs and so many of his contemporaries back before WWI and WWII).There is no bitterness or questioning in the characters, triumphant WASPS whose reason, courage and belief in their supremacy are eventually portrayed against the weakness of blacks, Muslims, and Indians and helps build THE BRIDGE, symbol of European civilization... Do you have a white hood hidden somewhere under your bed Mr Douglas ? "}]
