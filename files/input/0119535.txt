ALLO is in a completely different in style to their previous two films Shallow Grave and Trainspotting.  But to say it is the weaker of the three films would be a fallacy.  Stylistically the film is excellent - reminding me a lot of a Coen brothers film.  The script is spot on and the performances of McGregor and Diaz are both excellent (which surprised me for Diaz) as their does seem to be a real chemistry between the two.  A very enjoyable romantic comedy overall, and if an old cynic like me can say that, it must be good.

What I got was a different film, but not in a bad way. It was fun and very different from anything else that came out around that time. But the funny thing was that after I saw it I kept thinking about it, little things; lines and camera shots that stuck in my head. By the time I watched it again, a week or so later, it was like the film was an old friend. There is a charm in every scene of A Life Less Ordinary and if you are able to pick up on it the film is a great experience. People I know are split on the film, most think its just OK. Although I enjoy ALLO its not perfect, some parts don't work very well and come across as corny, but the good, my man Ewan is just great as the lovable loser, far outweighs the bad and thats why it has a place in my film collection.no quote(This review was originally written by a man but then a robot replaced him.)

It does seem a very strange mess of a movie if you browse thru it or happen to miss a scene while going to the bathroom, but I made myself pause it when I needed to and now I seem to get it!!!Part road trip, part romantic comedy, part wacky comedy, part fantasy, it's all about how the angel Gabriel (Dan Hedaya) is getting pressure from the Big Man Himself to arrange love matches that will actually last.Down on earth, oblivious to what's going on in heaven, a janitor named Robert (Ewan McGregor) has just been fired and replaced by a robot. His ruthless boss (a hysterical Ian Holm) refuses to even act apologetic about replacing hardworking men with mindless robots he doesn't have to pay. His reason completely gone, Robert kidnaps the spoiled princess daughter of his boss, Celine (Cameron Diaz) and hits the road with her, hoping to get his job, some money, or just an apology!!! This is the kind of film which is perfect when you need something very fluffy and fun with no heaviness. There is some violence (one very funny scene involves Delroy Lindo forcing Robert to dig his own grave), but it's so funny and comedic that it's not going to fit in with the regular violence in movies, like in Die Hard or something.It's a very delightful film for anyone who likes Ewan or Cameron.

Boyle uses many great cinematic techniques to make the film seem even more fantastic, and Hodges writing is some of the funniest in a long time.

I had thought previously THE BEACH was the big Boyle flop but that dubious accolade goes to this movie which has a woefully unfunny script which proves that if a film is good it's down to the director but if it's bad it's down to the screenwriter . 28 DAYS LATER is a rather derivative , contrived screenplay lacking in internal logic and Boyle rises far above it to construct a stylish post apocalyptic drama/horror movie . But it's easy to crank up the thrills and chills in a horror movie . With a comedy it's far more difficult because if the jokes aren't funny then the whole movie fails due to this It's not so much the jokes that are a failure , it's the whole screenplay by John Hodge . It's painfully underdeveloped and reminds you of other films that are slightly superior ones like the Charlie Sheen vehicle THE CHASE or infinitely superior ones like A MATTER OF LIFE AND DEATH . It's impossible to know why Hodge needed to introduce a fantasy element because the two angels could have easily have been mere mortals though perhaps that might have reminded the audience of the highly regarded Coen brothers . Ironically enough you're still reminded of the Coen brothers regardless and what good screenwriters they are . You're also reminded of those Osamond shows with their cheesy , predictable sketches contain painfully obvious punchlines . For example kidnapper and victim go in to phone box , kidnapper phones victim' s father and in a foul mouth rant describes what he's going to do with victim if he doesn't get the ransom , only to finish by saying  Oh sorry I must have dialled the wrong number  . It's not helped McGregor's natural inability to deliver a comic line and if anyone's laughing at this point they must have changed the channel Boyle is on record as saying that the film in hindsight was  A bit too zany  and it's why it led to its relative box office failure but it's failures are down to reasons I've outlined above . Boyle did make his name with the darkly comical SHALLOW GRAVE and TRAINSPOTTING so he probably wanted to let his creative hair down a bit with a broader comedy that would appeal to an American audience . It shows what a great director he is that both A LIFE LESS ORDINARY and THE BEACH were flops and he was destined for obscurity till 28 DAYS LATER came along "}{"Title":"Too messy to be enjoyable","Date":"7 February 2004","Score":"16 out of 26 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Crime, Fantasy","Review":"  With divorce rates increasing, two angels are sent on a mission to bring men and women together as they should be - or not bother coming back to heaven. Their mission is a young man, Robert, who has been replaced as a cleaner by a robot and the spoilt daughter of his boss, Celine.  The two meet as Robert bursts into his boss's office to demand his job back and accidentally ends up kidnapping Celine.  As they go on the run they gradually grow to hate each other less.Following up Trainspotting was never going to be an easy task - but at least they could have at least got near the quality of that film!  In what feels like it wanted to be deliberately quirky, the plot involves angels controlling fate to bring two young people together in love.  If it developed this idea in a structured and enjoyable manner then everything would have been fine, however as it is it is all over the place and doesn't really make much in the way of sense.  Instead it feels more like a wildly out of control collection of stylish ideas.In terms of narrative it barely hangs together and it creates a problem when it requires us to care for the characters and be part of their romance (as in, care about it).  It is very appropriate that the end credits features a cartoon of sorts for that is fitting for the level of development that is in the central tale.  The action is silly but not to the point where it gains the imaginative quirkiness of, say, the Coen brothers.  Instead it is hard to penetrate the film and get involved with it, the action is daft and illogical, the laughs are rare and the characters are more like cartoon characters than people.  It could have worked - but it doesn't.The cast is good on paper, but the lack of material lets them down. McGregor came to fame through Boyle, but he gets done no favours here; he does stand out as someone who tries hard to make the material work, but he can't manage it.  Diaz is good as well but again it's the material given to her that is the problem.  The support cast is better simply because their lack of character and development isn't a problem; Lindo is good even if Hunter doesn't really fit in; although Holm and Hedaya have OK little cameos.Overall this has energy but it doesn't really hang together in a way that works.  It has touches of imagination and style but mostly it drowns in a sea of quirkiness lacking substance.  It's a shame that such a talented cast and crew didn't have something better to work with - quirkiness for quirkiness' sake is not enough here.

After all, where else would you see two cupids committing lots of violence in order to bring two lovers together? Both Holly Hunter and Delroy Lindo are hilarious as the psychotic cupids. The romance track between the freshly paired Ewan McGregor and Cameron Diaz provides another comedic track. They share a great chemistry making the unusual romance between the fiery Celine and the naive Robert very convincing. There's also a brilliant song sequence in which the two actors display their singing talents and dancing skills. Of course, they are supported by talents like Ian Holm and Stanley Tucci who provide excellent comic relief. Hirakubo's sharp editing and Brian Tufano's superb camera-work give the film a slick edge.

Director Danny Boyle's previous hits, e.g. Shallow Grave, Trainspotting, were morality tales with wit and style that defined the British cinema of the 90s. ALLO is not up to either wit or style in a rambling odd story of frustrated love. Ewan McGregor, an actor who is lively and dynamic in his two previous Boyle pictures never seems to find his character as Robert, a closet pulp fiction writer/janitor living in Salt Lake City, Utah. Robert's lack of Mr. Clean talent result in a ballistic impulse after he is fired and replaced by a bad R2D2 imitation robotic floor-sweeper. The target of his anger, the bratty daughter of the company owner.Camerion Diaz as Celine is lovely in the role of a spoiled brat kidnapped by Robert, but the chemistry between the two actors never heats up the screen. Wacky heiress Celine can't sing or dance while the nebbish kidnapper sings and dances rings around her. Charming Robert can't threaten or write a convincing ransom letter, but Celine is such a harpy, her condesending and chrulishness towards Robert fail to exude any audience sympathy. Instead, it transfers to the overwhelmed kidnapper rather than the shrewish Celine.Adding to the muddled storyline are two bumbling angels (Holly Hunter and Delroy Lindo) whose divine task is to assure the mismatched pair fall in love. It is a subplot that distracts rather than adds to the story. If the plot sounded confused it is because Boyle never seemed to make up his mind what the kind of film he wanted to direct.The stellar cast attempts to save their roles but are handicapped by a screenplay that never quite follows a recognizable genre. The American film debut of director Danny Boyle and producer Andrew MacDonald flounders under so many problems that ALLO is a comedy of errors, misdirection, and ambiguity that failed to entertain.

Actually I think the truth is quite the opposite - most likely you will be utterly confused by the movie and be very hard pressed to decide whether you liked it or not.There is a rich girl and a dude with quite a bad luck run going on. The guy kidnaps a girl. There are also some angels whose role isn't clear. A lot of confusing things happen and then the movie ends. With a claymation sequence.Perhaps if they threw out the whole angels angle it would be better. Perhaps the angels are the only thing saving it from being utter dreck. I don't know. That's the most honest comment I can give - I dunno. Much like the angels in question - it seems that even they are not really sure of what are their plans and motivations. But even if I disregard the whole angels and divine intervention stuff, sure fact is that the plot just zigs and zags and has more dead ends then Ozzy Osbourne's hair. Right when you think the movie goes somewhere, the plot throws another tiring curve-ball right up to the end. Which you probably will not like. Or will get it and then write essays about it here on the message boards, but let's not go there, I beg you.For me the biggest complaint is that the movie tries so hard to enter the quite elusive weird but entertaining category and constantly fails. It is at times witty, at times trippy, at times baffling but never quite reaches the entertainment level it aims for. I can't say I didn't enjoy it, at times I really felt I'm loving it, but more it went on I couldn't but miss the fact that the creators really didn't have a clue what to do with it or where they wanted it to go. Rewatching further reinforced the fact I had the first time around - the movie's a mess, no matter how much it tried to hide it.To sum up, this movie is at the same time good and amusing as well as utterly confusing, unpolished and tiresome.

They should have stuck with heroin. What they are trying to achieve here is unclear, although I would believe it if they said they just wanted to make True Romance but it had been done already a few years back.A Life Less Ordinary's problems begin with the script and end only with the credits. The characters' motivations reverse themselves from one line to the next. The editing which is either traditional and incompetent, or non-traditional and ineffective, I couldn't tell. And the plot shifts jerkily and randomly between romantic comedy, thriller, and 'Pulp-Fiction' rip-off. It's as if the makers sat around with the spinner off an old kiddie game. OK, what next?(spin) violence (spin) surrealism (spin) romance. She (spin) cries (spin) kisses him (spin) shoots him. There's no sign that anyone thought even one minute ahead -- any idea, no matter how irrelevant or disconnected, was immediately written in.These poor, poor actors. You can almost hear the director telling them, You're supposed to be having an argument, so just yell each line louder than the last. That's not at all to put the blame on the direction, which, like the acting, must have been an impossible job.Holly Hunter, Dan Hedaya and a couple of others are humiliated in a set-up plot out of 'Here Comes Mr Jordan,' or 'It's a Wonderful Life.' You know, the angels with a job to do thing. Their struggle to rescue what must have been an obviously failing vehicle is genuinely depressing to watch.Ewan McGregor, as the inexplicably Scottish kidnapper, at least manages to come off likable. I think his strategy was to form a casual alliance with bewildered viewers by maintaining an air of complete confusion.Cameron Diaz plays the kidnap victim who comes to enjoy her captivity and collaborate with her captor. (Would that audience members could do the same.) I didn't recognize her, but she was so bad that for a few minutes I thought she might be Madonna. Doubtless I've missed her fine work in other films. If she made no effort at all one could hardly blame her, as her character has no consistent qualities or drives, being made up of a series of nearly disconnected sketches. She has at least mastered that careful overenunciation typical of models who go into acting (a trait that I suspect results from a fear of being labeled as thick). There is one moment when you get a real insight, sort of behind-the-scenes of the acting world. McGregor says his line, the camera cuts to Diaz, and she hesitates in apparently real confusion, then flashes what looks like a smile of relief as she suddenly thinks of a way to deliver her line uh, angrily.At the end, there's a sort of epilogue in which the completely unconvincing protagonists try to convince you that you've learned a big lesson about love from them, while behind them, key scenes are replayed in a style that seems calculated to give you a feeling of nostalgia about events that changed you forever, just like when you hear Stairway to Heaven. Except in this case they happened on screen within the past two hours and caused only puzzlement.It's hard to understand why this movie isn't simply savaged by every reviewer. I actually walked in without any idea of what it was going to be about, who had made it, nothing. My only fear, based on the title, was that it would be a terrible-disease-or-handicap movie.

Is it common around business men to own their own armies and shoot anyone they want to?Yes, I know, this was not supposed to be a realistic movie. But I don't care, because it was a stupid and bad movie. The worst thing was that I had the choice to watch another one. So if you have several channels transmitting movies at the same time, do not choose to switch to the one sending this one. Its just not worth it!

It takes an unoriginal storyline of kidnap and love, but makes it less ordinary by trapping it in this dream-world and personifying the forces of nature and reality as, literally, the forces of fate. Sometimes very humorous, with off-beat situations, scenes, and characters that steal the spotlight (Maury Chaukin as the backwoods neighbor and Stanley Tucci as Celine's Dentist), this movie is worth watching.

The film begins with the angel Gabriel (Dan Hedaya) routing two ridiculous angels (Delroy Lindo and Holly Hunter) to Earth to help mastermind a romance between a janitor turned would-be-kidnapper (Ewan McGregor) and his apathetic, millionaire's-daughter victim Celine (Cameron Diaz).  McGregor's character, Robert, is fired from her father's company and replaced by a robot.  As a result, he storms small-mindedly into the director's office and finds himself swallowed-up by security officers.  He eventually knabs a gun and loses it, but Celine kicks the gun back into his grasp, hoping to be abducted.  The film then becomes a predictable piece of tripe &#150; half buddy flick, half ultra-violent, Generation X, love-on-the-run story that was so popular at the time of its release(True Romance, Natural Born Killers).  Robert and Celine get along pseudo-fabulously, become co-conspirators, travel across the state of Utah in an old El Dorado, fall in and out of love, and learn an important lesson.  Unfortuantely, the same film came out a few months ahead of this one (without the love stuff) -- it was called Nothing To Lose. The scenes with the angels are both pointless and sensational (almost irritating &#150; Wings Of Desire this ain't), and I'm really beginning to wonder about Holly Hunter and her role choices (this and Crash &#150; someone get her a new agent, quick!).  In fact, it's as if director Danny Boyle is aping Oliver Stone -- going through the motions of making a film that looks entertaining.  There's plenty of violence and brazenness, but hardly a smidgen of good-hearted humor or emotion.  Still, McGregor is good as he plays the hapless idiot &#150; a dull, post-modern, trash-novel loving, blue-collar loser.  Aside from that, there's not much more to compliment here, other than the film's sprint-like acceleration out of theaters!

It's enjoyable according to a number of things you can get from many other films. Conventional comedy values built around romantic stories. Escapism in recognizable form for anyone vaguely used to Hollywood. But this is a little bit more than that. It's part of a trilogy of films featuring a trilogy of interesting artists Boyle/Hodge/McGregor. This set of films was important for it established the basis of 2 interesting and important careers (Hodge in the meanwhile seems to have deviated from interesting stuff, let's hope he comes back). What they did was what one might call experimentalism, or even theoretical experiments leaked onto practical products. Of the 3 films, this is probably the less interesting. It's not especially entertaining, and even as an experiment it's not especially interesting. The point was to pick up a specific genre, romantic comedy in this case, and twist it or at least give it a new edge. The result falls a lot behind what, say, the Coens did in Intolerable Cruelty. Still, McGregor would become a powerful actor, one of the best, and Boyle is always worthwhile no matter what he does, and he's done some impressive stuff since. So, this film becomes a sort of an historical artifact if you want to do archaeological research of their careers.What you learn here is that from the beginning Boyle trusts his intuition, and that vein prevails over how he rationalizes his film conceptions. Those intuitions may be really powerful or come to nothing (like here), but he's always willing to take the chance, and i appreciate him for that, i'll want to see anything from him. And you learn that McGregor, already back here was self-conscious as an actor. He knows he's acting, so the question is not so much to be real (as an obscene amount of actors always try to) but to deliver the acting while acknowledging it. That's probably the more fundamental theme of the art in the last century. As far as cinema acting goes, Ewan McGregor may be its state of art.But this film, unless you place it in the perspective of their makers future, is pretty much useless.My opinion 2/5http//www.7eyes.wordpress.com "}{"Title":"Offbeat and strange and crazy comedy of unexpected love with help from up above!","Date":"11 May 2008","Score":"","Genre":"Comedy, Crime, Fantasy","Review":" 1997's A Life Less Ordinary is a well done film that's blended well with some different supporting points even if they seem strange and crazy still the story is well done with the main theme proving that love is possible when unexpected.

You will smirk at the introduction of Robert, the very real male lead. You will be a little disturbed by addition of the trigger-happy Celine. As the story progresses, you will begin to marvel at the wonderful characterization of Robert. You wonder if it is the writing or Ewan McGregor that makes him so real. You wish Cameron Diaz was given a little more to work with. You become even more infatuated with Robert. Then the introduction of the two match-making Angels. Jackson and O'Reilly. You wonder why more religious groups didn't throw a stink-fit over thuggish Angels. You enjoy Holly Hunter's attempted if not entirely successful performance. She honestly does try. Her partner is more successful. A helter-skelter scene ensues where everybody proceeds to attempt to kill everyone else. It's exciting, but you wonder if it is a good thing you've become so oblivious to violence. The scenes prior to the ending are amusing. The way the ending occurs is totally unexpected, and therefore not that great. I hate it when movies require additional suspension of disbelief. First you have to accept that Angels have no moral difficulty with terrifying humans out of their wits and people would actually behave this way, then you have to accept a sort of supernatural ending.In short Ewan Mcgregor; Fantastic. Cameron Diaz; one dimensional but not her fault. Angels;Holly Hunter tried, don't blame her blame whoever cast her. Delroy is definitely better.Rent and analyze.

The camera work was also brilliant especially the scene were Robert goes to pick up his ransom.  The shots of the Utah desert and the dirt road car chase will be remembered for a long time.  Another great aspect was the very cool sound track.  With tracks by groups such as the Sneaker Pimps, Faithless and the Prodigy this film is bound to sell a lot of sound track cds.

Two beings (or non-beings) from beyond (in original and earlier versions they would be angels) are sent to earth to make sure that two people meet, fall in love and marry. The chief who gives them this last chance (or they will be doomed to live on earth), laments the high rate of divorce from the past work of these two spirits in human form. The two objects of their mission are a disgruntled former employee of a mega-firm, and the spoiled rotten rich daughter of the belligerent, brash billionaire boss of the mega-firm. Any viewer would make a connection that it's no wonder their marriage matches fail. What transpires in this film is a series of mishaps, accidents, crimes, chases, and goofy goings-on. But they are not funny &#x96; even tragic in some instances. The script is weak and the whole plot just doesn't come off as comedy. Nor is the romance even imaginable, let alone believable. This appears like two films intertwined. The one is the fantasy, with the two spirits on a mission of love. The other is crime, or more properly a bag of crimes. And somehow, comedy is supposed to link these. But it doesn't work. The cast mostly are OK in the characters they have to play, but overboard at times. There isn't a single likable character in the film. Ian Holm is the greedy, controlling, self-centered billionaire dad, Naville. Cameron Diaz is his spoiled rich, greedy, self- centered daughter, Celine. Like father like daughter. But in this case it's hard to like either character. This is a picture of a super wealthy dysfunctional family.Ewan McGregor is the disgruntled former employee who was replaced in his cleaning job by a robot. He is naïve, hapless and not very convincing in his role as Robert Lewis. Holly Hunter plays the extraterrestrial O'Reilly and Delroy Lindo is her cohort, Jackson. O'Reilly spends much of her time in bandages, splints and crutches from mishaps. Stanley Tucci is Elliot Zweikel, another supposed character for comedy. The mayhem amongst this motley assembly of characters is no more funny than someone shooting your best friend. That's what this film is &#x96; a collection of shootings and assorted crimes for laughs. It sends a message that all this is OK if the two subjects come together in the end. Since when does the end justify the means? Besides, who could believe that this match would last? It's easy to see why this film flopped at the box office and lost a few million dollars.

In fact, if I was to give them more credit than they probably deserved, perhaps I can say that maybe when they made this one they were emulating cheeky directors a la Luc Besson in creating a nonsensical and quirky parody of all candy floss American rom-comedies till then (1997). However, as I said, that's more credit than they deserve, because this film just reeks of a bunch of film makers still trippy over their recent success, and just daftly putting out a film that they probably just enjoyed and had fun all round in creating in the process.The plot, albeit pure reverie, was played out really quirkily by both McGregor and Diaz, especially the former, for without whom the preposterous nature of the plot would otherwise have slipped utterly like a cold salmon. That said, the plot lines really could have been tighter, less wacky, and definitely even more coherent and sharp at the end. With this film, other than the fact that Boyle & Co just went fantasmagoric on the at times witty script, laced it with Britpop, chucked it with a dance number given the fact they had Hollywood backing for a film for once (and Holly Hunter at that!!!), there was still the feeling that if they were going to create it in such light, there were boundaries they could have pushed; crazier antics and twists they could have thrown in. For example, when Diaz knows more about kidnapping than McGregor at the Bank, or when they have a showdown with 'rich Dad' there were many more hilarious avenues they could have explored, aka raising it to the level of the film's best moments- zany dance numbers. Instead, the Scot boys have made a film that is about 'what could have been', topped it with Wallace & Gromit style animation, garnished it with 'divine interventionist' incredulousness, and pretty much based its premise on sheer tongue in cheek bonhomie. The only thing I liked about this film other than Ewan McGregor's Gucci shirt and 1970s retro glam rock mullet was the fact that it did further the decent inroads for the cross Atlantic film exchange between Britain and the States (I mean who else would have Bobby Darin's Beyond the Sea alongside Oasis' Round Are Way on a soundtrack!)

Ewan McGregor plays Robert Lewis, the hesitant kidnapper who gets himself into the predicament accidentally because he's mad that janitor robots replaced him at a local business and his protest went awry, his victim is a controlling spoiled brat Celine Neville (Diaz) the child of his ex-employer, who, having been kidnapped before, constantly criticizes his kidnapping style. But believe it or not, you forget about the kidnapping altogether after half an hour as the two bond with each other.Fact is, the kidnapping kicks off the movie but doesn't need to last because that's not what it's about, though they get themselves into enough legal trouble to last the whole film as a result of it. It's actually a romance about divine intervention.Yes, divine intervention.Apparently, St. Gabriel, who is upset at the lack of true and pure love, sends two agents down (played by Jackson O'Reilly and Holly Hunter in one of her most hilarious roles), to get them together or risk saying adios to pearly gates forever. They get mixed up with the apparently highly crooked Mr. Neville who wants them to kill Robert. Of course they can't do that because that would defy their purpose, on several accounts. Add a few gun fights, lots gunshot wounds, people getting crushed by cars, and some hilarious dialogue and situations and you get the general jist of the film. It doesn't try to make sense, but it does haphazardly in a frenetic, frantic, truely crazy way (though all cinematography stays well on the ground, no flying fairies or can can dancing here, and no, that's not a jab at Moulin Rouge).The film also boasts a slew of great performances from Mcgregor and Diaz (very creative performances if you can imagine such a thing), Stanley Tucci the sleazy dentist ex-fiancee, to Ian Holm and Ian McNiece as the insidious Mr. Neville and his henchman. But the movie's real star, even beating out the couple's Sinatra dance duet in a honky tonk or their high speed racing in dilapitated pickup trucks, is the screenplay.

Of course she'd actually been in love from the second she untied herself in the cabin but refused to leave.Hell, probably before even THAT.But it's McGregor that steals the show.He just shined as an inept but lovable kidnapper who probably fell in love the minute he had a chance to get a good look at Diaz. He is in WAY over his head, but you wind up rooting for him anyway.I was even laughing while he was crying, when digging his own grave though I am not sure if I was supposed to.Even his declaration of love, when it finally came, was still complicated and funny, fighting off Lindo and arguing with Celine.Offbeat, touching, and hell, just plain silly, I liked this one from beginning to end.

A Life Less Ordinary (ALLO) is not your average movie -- it's odd, but not in a bad way.As a forewarning, the first ten or fifteen minutes of the movie don't do anything to justify the rest. If you sit through them though, you'll be rewarded. In my opinion, this is one of the most outrageously hilarious movies I've ever seen. Cameron Diaz and Ewan McGregor play their parts perfectly, and Holly Hunter's character is always there as the one person you can't decide if you hate or love. She can be annoying, but overall she just adds to the humor.If you read the back of the movie, don't pay attention to a word of it. It doesn't give you the real plot line. This is about Robert (McGregor) who in a rash decision kidnaps his boss's daughter (Diaz) so that he can get his job back. Celine is not your average victim. She doesn't seem the least bit phased that she's been kidnapped, and she even criticizes Robert and his antics, overall offering to help. What they don't know is that this isn't just a twist of fate, but a twist of fate that's trying to get them to fall in love with each other. O'Reilly and Jackson are sent from somewhere up above with the mission of uniting man and woman in love. Robert and Celine are the unlucky people they're trying unsuccessfully to unite.Hope that helped, and do watch the movie -- it's worth it!

Taking the Tarantino connections to it's logical end, the two truly worthwhile films - Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction - are both referenced here, from the smaller details such as Hunter's pseudo-Honey Bunny turn as the Guardian Angel through to Delroy Lindo's appearance as Jackson (Samuel L.?). More obvious references are McGregor's paraphrasing of Dogs dialogue when shot in the back of a car, through to a blatant Pulp Fiction reference which I won't name as it is vital to the plot.Having said that, A Life Less Ordinary isn't a bad film by any means, (Quentin himself has made much, much worse), but then neither is it very good and there lies the problem. As a comedy it has some humorous moments, but the juxtaposition of English-American humo(u)r never really passes muster and so it doesn't fully work as a comedy. Neither does it work as drama or romance as the initial situation (McGregor kidnaps Diaz, a rich man's daughter who wants to be kidnapped) is played with no level of realism. 25 pop songs flood the film, which might sell soundtracks but off-balances any sense of realism. Direction is flashy, but with no real finesse or empathy for it's subject matter. So that the focus of the plot - the kidnap - is undertaken with the ultimate in pop culture, the choking last gasp of a movie genre that threatened to be bigger than it was. As a result, the essential premise of the movie is unbelievable, therefore the entire picture has no supporting framework on which to hang itself.The rest of the film isn't so bad, though the indulgence of claymation could have been passed over. McGregor sports an unappealing Lou Ferringo haircut throughout and is significantly less animated than his plasticine counterpart. Not a total failure by any means, this is more a forgivable exercise by three men who got given too many toys. Stick to the squalid bedsits and drug dependencies next time boys - they made for much better movies...

Of course extreme circumstances start to bring them together; they might still need a push in the right direction though.Anybody who has seen director Danny Boyle's previous films featuring Ewan McGregor may be expecting lots of swearing and violence; there is some but by no means as much as this is a romantic comedy.

Sadly, A Life Less Ordinary was not half so well received.Critics accused it of simply missing the point and lacking direction. And, yes, I can see their point.

It's about two angels, charged with the task of getting the most unlikely couple (spoilt rich girl Cameron Diaz and penniless writer and toilet cleaner, Ewan McGregor) to fall in love.

Yes, it has both elements (mainly romance), but not much comedy. What replaces the traditional laughs is more a surreal atmosphere more akin to a Monty Python film in places.Personally, I liked it. Or rather most of it. There's not many people who seems to like all of it. I will admit that there were certain sub-plots that could have been left out.It's not that funny, but its uniqueness does give it some kudos.

I thought it was funny and I am glad that I did hire it because I did quite enjoy it. The humour was actually quite decent humour and not the typical try-hard humour that most romantic comedies, as this is what A Life Less Ordinary is, tend to display.Now heaven is getting quite upset at the number of relationships that are falling apart so two angels are sent to Earth to bring two people together and if they don't then they cannot return. The two people are completely the opposite, which is typically American, and so the angels see it is basically an impossible task. One of them is a dreamer who works as a cleaner and wants to write trashy novels, while the other is the rich daughter of the guy's employer. The guy is sacked from his job and replaced with robots and then he looses his current girlfriend and is kicked out of home due to unpaid rent. He then, in frustration, barges into his bosses office with a gun and demands his job back.The daughter is simply lazy and a crack shot. A dentist wants to marry her but she is not interested so she decides to test him by shooting an apple off the top of his head. He moves and is hit in the head. She is then brought to her father and is told that she now has to work for his money. Now, she is in the office when he bursts in and he ends up kidnapping her, but it turns out that she knows more about kidnapping than he does so decides to teach him a few lessons.Well, this is how the movie turns out. Of course it is predictable as a romantic comedy as it is not a movie where both parties end up dead, as they do in Romeo and Juliet. In fact, Shakespeare actually wrote a lot of decent romantic comedies, but they are intelligent, unlike the garbage that is churned out of Hollywood these days. A Life Less Ordinary is not one of those garbage movies, though it doesn't really rise to the heights of a Shakespearian comedy.My really only complaint with the movie is how it deals with heaven. Basically God is not in control and sits away from everything letting the world run itself. Occasionally he sticks his hand in to make things run a little smoother but generally he doesn't care. Also, there is the idea that the rich go to heaven and the poor go to hell and there is no way out of that. Really that is just absolute garbage and shows how people seriously don't understand the way God operates. God doesn't judge us on wealth or on how good we've been. Rather he judges us on who we have given our life to. If we have told God to get lost then that is it, we don't want him then he doesn't want us. But if we ask God to be on our side, then he will take us as a friend and welcome us into eternity.

Although the fantastical elements of the film can be accepted, there is at least one scene where the inevitable repercussions cannot be ignored but are never addressed. For a film that has such a strong first half, the second half verges on boring. For me that's probably the worst thing that can be said of any movie.The soundtrack is no doubt great if you're playing the CD in the car. However the placing of the songs seems all wrong, like Boyle was simply trying to replicate what he had achieved in Trainspotting where the songs underlined the scenes perfectly.

In order to get back at the company he kidnaps the CEO's daughter, Cameron Diaz. An unlikely relationship develops between the kidnapper and kidnapee, a relationship helped along by two angels who are in charge of matchmaking human beings on Earth. It's a quirky romantic comedy with an unexpectedly violent streak running down the middle.It's hard to comprehend exactly what this movie is trying to accomplish. It's romantic but not exactly touching. It's comedic without being overtly hilarious. It's eccentric and violent without feeling like an exploitation film. This weird mix of clashing genres actually does the film some good though, as it really is a lot of fun. It's strange, it's offbeat, and it's plenty entertaining from start to finish. It's got that Danny Boyle style that courses so strong through the auteur's veins. Of course you can't expect Trainspotting from it because A Life Less Ordinary is substantially watered down, and doesn't have the kind of human element we see in a dark character study like Trainspotting. The story is nothing special, but it's fun and it serves its purpose.Again, I'm not sure what the point of A Life Less Ordinary is, but neither do I really care.

As such, I'm made it a bit of a mission to take a look at as much of his back catalogue as I can whenever they are shown on TV. So this is how I came to watch this one. I have to say it's not the best film I've seen associated with his name, but it's passable. More of my thoughts after this very brief summary.We start in heaven (where else), where two angels, O'Reilly and Jackson, are given their last chance to, let's say, facilitate a couple falling in love. It's a tough case; two people from very different backgrounds. First there's Robert Lewis who's a cleaner (& a writer in his spare time) who has just lost his job and been dumped by his girlfriend. Then there's Celine Naville a rich socialite whose father wants her to go to work for him. They are thrown together when Robert goes to see Celine's father to demand his job back and things go slightly wrong. He ends up kidnapping Celine and taking her to a cabin in the wilderness. He really doesn't have a clue and Celine ends up taking the lead; deciding she may as well try to get some money out of her father. Meanwhile, O'Reilly and Jackson are hired by Celine's father to find them. As you can see, it's getting a bit complicated already and we're only part-way through! I'll leave it there though or the Spoiler Police (confusing plots division) will have me kidnapped in amusing circumstances (again).A well made film that has the beginnings many of the hallmarks of Boyle's latter works. Some interesting ideas thrown in, some that worked and some that didn't, but then I see it as a bit of a stepping stone for Boyle. Nice performances all round; Ewan McGregor did a decent job as Robert Lewis, although his haircut is pretty bizarre! Cameron Diaz did a great job as Celine; it's the kind of role she's pretty comfortable in. I thought both Holly Hunter as O'Reilly and Delroy Lindo as Jackson were excellent. Honourable mentions must also go to; Ian McNeice as Mayhew, Frank Kanig as Ted, Stanley Tucci as Elliot Zweikel, Tony Shalhoub as Al and Ian Holm as Naville (Celine's father).Although I'm a fan of Danny Boyle's work, I'm afraid this one failed to hit the mark (for me). I found the plot far too over-complicated, almost like they were trying to fit far too many ideas in all at once. To me it would have been much more interesting to see the story from the point of view of O'Reilly and Jackson, but then I guess I'm not a screenwriter (yet). Yes, there were some nice touches, for instance, I loved the song and dance routine in the bar; very funny. Over all though, it's one I'll have to sit on the fence as far as recommendation goes; it's kind of in the middle there somewhere.My score 5.7/10IMDb Score 6.3/10 (based on 20,915 votes at the time of going to press).Rotten Tomatoes 'Tomatometer' Score 39/100 (based on 36 reviews counted at the time of going to press).

I had read reviews saying this was an original story(ALLO) and a breath of fresh air. This is not so, I urge you to read the summary for Two of a Kind(don't see the film unless you like 80's garbage films) and see if the 2 contrast(they don't). While I'm all for a well scripted and acted romantic comedy, don't profess originality unless you know it to be so. I am still a huge Danny Boyle(Sunsine one of my personal favourites) and Ewan McGregor(Renton all time anti-hero) fan, this film just helps to remind me that no one is ever perfect.

I am a fan of Danny Boyle's work from Transpotting to 28 Days Later. A Life Less Ordinary has a lot of aspects that Boyle later used in his child fairy-tale Millions from inventive camera tricks to a melding of fantasy sequences with reality. The main thing taken from this viewing however is the tragedy that Ewan McGregor and Boyle may never work together again. Ewan proves here again to have done some of his best work, and the work that got him noticed, with his old friend and producing partner. It is a real shame that after their differences, stemming from Boyle's casting of Leo DiCaprio instead of McGregor on The Beach, causes their creativity to never join again. At least we have some great films to show from it while it lasted.McGregor's and Cameron Diaz's characters are fated to fall in love. God has deemed it so and the chief of police in Heaven has got his best team on the job to make sure it happens. Unfortunately for them, the hysterical Delroy Lindo and Holly Hunter, if they fail at their job they must stay on Earth forever. Let's just say they think out of the box and do everything in their powers to make love strike. After a botched powertrip turns into a kidnapping, McGregor soon finds that his victim is starting to call the shots in order to make the crime successful. Comedy ensues as the two leads go on their journey to get back at Diaz's rich father and make some money in the mean time. Whether their time together results in a Cupid's arrow sort of love remains to be seen, but as the two orchestrate the crime while Heaven's police conduct the circumstances, the audience just goes along for the ride.Boyle uses an enormous cast of great actors that come and go through the proceedings. Stanley Tucci is fantastic, Tony Shaloub is great in a role that at first seemed unbelievably wasted, but, in a turn like that of Silent Bob in Chasing Amy, comes through with the poignant and funny anecdote needed to continue the plot, and Timothy Olyphant is a welcome face and humorous in a very bit part. The sheer number of cameos are too many to mention, but Maury Chaykin deserves singling out as the hick country man who's simple mind adds many laughs, including the song and dance number he introduces with McGregor and Diaz singing Beyond the Sea. While filled with clichés and homage galore, the film moves along at a fast pace utilizing each aspect to full effect creating a satire on both the kidnap and romantic comedy genres. We even get treated to a reenactment of the memorable Tim Roth/Harvey Keitel getaway scene from Reservoir Dogs. The film gets everything right with pitch-perfect timing and tongue-in-cheek acting mixed with some real emotional performances when called upon. Every song enhances the visuals on screen, especially a nicely placed REM tune while our characters are in peril. Even the claymation ending credit sequence is a joy to watch.Boyle proves to me here that he can do it all the gritty drug lifestyle drama, the romantic comedy, the socially conscious zombie kill spree, and the family-friendly morality tale. Those are just the ones I've seen from his filmography, so it will be a pleasure to see how he continues on his string of successes without yet going to the same well. We'll see how his first foray into the science fiction genre turns out when Sunshine is released in the coming months. While he and old friend McGregor had a great run, we can always hope that one day they will reconcile and bring us that sequel to Trainspotting that has been bandied about the rumormill.

He's an idler who used to dream up the plots of trashy novels when he was on the job. Now he's not only jobless, but his girl walks out of him when she finds someone more reliable.Diaz is a spoiled rich girl who actually helps him escape when he holds up her father and a bunch of security guards and kidnaps her. She soon convinces him that they can share the ransom money. Turns out she has a weird sense of humor, teasing and tormenting her naive and clueless kidnapper, and a lot of mean spirited plot twists happen along the way to the two finding romance.The strange interaction of the two with heavenly agents assigned to get them to fall in love, is handled with wacky deftness. All of their far out plans to unite Diaz and McGregor seem to go awry, until...Well, you have to watch the film to get the full story.Summing up Enjoyable, far out screwball comedy.

ALLO just about manages it without recourse to offering Gene Kelly a part.The script combines elements from Frank Capra's It's A Wonderful Life and David Lynch's Wild at Heart, mixed together in an Odd Couple romance story penned by John Hodge.Hodge had worked with director Danny Boyle before, but ALLO was their first Hollywood movie together. The extra money available is evident in the production and I wonder whether the film would have been better if it had been shot on a shoestring budget in Birmingham instead of in America, where every whim of writer and director is apparently indulged.Ewan MacGregor and Cameron Diaz are likable leads and they are well backed up by the US/UK supporting cast. The film forces you to keep watching by the sheer force of the cast's personality, which overcomes most of the sillier elements of its plot.Although this movie is an acquired taste, nevertheless I recommend that you try ALLO.

He plays well alongside Diaz who is superb as always, playing a snobbish, helping, stunning elegant woman who is kidnapped by McGregor and the two form a questionable relationship.The acting by both is great as always it's the story however which disappoints.Its flat, unexciting and unfunny. The relationship between the characters is good and has a different perspective for a love relationship, unlike some cliché films such as Love Actually, this 1997 film goes for a different approach by combing two very different personalities to work together in difficult situations.Only worth watching if you like corny story lines but the acting is great but be warned.

It's not the standard romantic comedy that most people are used to.  The idea of divine intervention, which comes into play in this film, may be a stretch or whatever you want to call it, and the story may be somewhat unbelievable, but it's a movie, that's what some movies are supposed to be.  But more importantly, it's entertaining. One of the things I found most striking about this film was the visual style Danny Boyle used.  There was something poetic about every shot, and some of the odd angles and cuts really lent themselves to the benefit of the story, not to mention the atmosphere it created in some of the sequences.I think Ewan McGregor did a excellent job in his role of the somewhat pathetic loser 'Robert', and Cameron Diaz seems the perfect match as the stuck-up rich girl 'Celine'.  Not to mention great performances by Holly Hunter, Delroy Lindo, and Ian Holm.  The cast of characters play well off of each other, and while it may not be the greatest film of all time, I think if you like romantic comedies, you owe it to yourself to at least check this one out.

Apart from Teen Flicks, they are the most cliché-ridden, stereotypic, repetitive, predictable kind of movie. Even worst, most of them don't even try to be funny these days, and concentrate on formulaic romance. This is why you should all see A Life Less Ordinary. Not only is it very funny, it is also very ORIGINAL! Now that is not the kind of thing I could say about any romantic comedy, but this is not any romantic comedy, after all, since it comes from the great Danny Boyle. Indeed, it's hard to find a romantic comedy which includes things such as two twisted angels, the worst kidnapper ever, a crazed girl who likes to shoot apples off the heads of people and other things like that. The acting is top-notch. Ewan McGregor is, as always, great and Cameron Diaz is perfect for the role. The chemistry between them is great. Holly Hunter and Delroy Lindo are not very angelic but they are very good as two angels who have to unite McGregor and Diaz. Ian Holm is funny in a relatively small role. Danny Boyle does a great job and his directing is perfect. The story is unpredictable(except, of course, for the ending) and many scenes are hilarious.

A Life Less Ordinary (ALLO) does this so well. The use of contemporary hits, old classic tunes, all adding to the plot of the film. The karaoke scene, the scene in the woods... Aside from the music, the actors hit their mark exactly. Special kudos to Ewan McGregor and Holly Hunter. Their characters are some of the most entertaining I've seen in a long time, and I've seen A LOT of movies! The story is sort of a cheesy one, that angels have to prove the human race is worth saving, love conquers all, etc... But you HARDLY notice that as it fades between main story and subplot, so you just want to have everything work out, rather than wonder where the story is supposed to be going.

I think that sometimes the dialogue between Cameron Diaz and Ewan MacGreggor was wooden at times, in the kind of stiff Love, Hate, Love relationship.  But Cameron's a hottie to begin with, so her provocative figure and smile were able to make up for her lack of good lines.  The movie kind of dragged in some places and was a little over the top, but it did have its funny moments, especially when Ewan MacGreggor says over the phone Look daughter I've got your asshole here.

It's downhill from that point as the ''Shallow Grave'' and ''Trainspotting'' team stumbles big-time in this money losing and ill-conceived marriage of It's A Wonderful Life and Raising Arizona. Just to be sure that no originality was added to this mix they incorporated a bit of Reservoir Dogs and cast Ewan McGregor to imitate Malcomb McDowell's Alex from Clockwork Orange. Good grief this is bad.Genre is anybody's guess but the database lists it as comedy and romance. The romance element is supposed to be supplied by McGregor and Cameron Diaz but with zero chemistry between them they have a hard time selling that element. Diaz is simply a horrible actress and Danny Boyle astonishingly clueless at acting for the camera direction so A Life Less Ordinary was pretty much doomed during the casting process.Actually it was doomed during the writing process as comedy is in short supply and what drama there is just isn't enough to carry the movie; of course the drama element is not supposed to be the strength of a comedy romance. What comedy elements exist are supplied by Holly Hunter and Delroy Lindo, who play two angels sent to earth to engineer a romance between McGregor and Diaz (who his character has kidnapped). Hunter's bits are quite good and worth watching if you just want to fast forward through the remaining 2/3 or the movie. Somehow she comes off about 20 times sexier than Diaz, while basically doing a female version of her Raising Arizona adversary Leonard Smalls. This was totally unintentional, very scary, and a major embarrassment to the younger Diaz.The kidnapping romance thing was done very badly in Excess Baggage but is actually worse here.Then again, what do I know?

After the one-two sucker punch of Shallow Grave and Trainspotting, two of the most financially and artistically successful British films of the mid 90s, Boyle, John Hodge and Andrew MacDonald put out something rather 'light' and even at times quite delirious. It's the story of a kidnapping, angels, humiliation, romance, attempted murder, song and dances, and all done with an air of spunky 90s cynicism and an air of frothy excitement and self-tongue-in-cheekiness that came in 50s rom-coms. Where else will we see Delroy Lindo and Holly Hunter play bickering angels who have a little trouble getting not-at-all lovebirds Ewan MacGregor and Cameron Diaz together? Or Ian Holm as Diaz's incredibly p-od father, who won't pay the ransom no matter what.There's much more, and truth be told some of it doesn't always work. The scenes where Celine is in the hostaged-would-be-care of Robert go between being incredibly funny and true to being almost annoying in their equal pathological stand-points of hating one another so fervently while having an underlying attraction there. And sometimes Boyle doesn't always know how to steer the action into its best domain through Hodge's ambitious but stir-crazy screenplay. But there's enough here to make it worth your while if at all fans of the actors- and how could one not be a fan of one of them (Hedaya is also in the mix, lest not forget Timothy Olyphant or Maury Chaykin)- or of Boyle trying something a little different while at the same time not losing the adrenaline rush of a director just on the legs of a good career starting up. It's an oddly likable film, even when it flops about. "},{"Title":"A Life Less Ordinary","Date":"16 March 2011","Score":"1 out of 7 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Crime, Fantasy","Review":" Director Danny Boyle had established himself as a very credible British director with his first two films Shallow Grave and Trainspotting, but his third film went a bit the other direction. Basically in Heaven, Gabriel (Commando's Dan Hedaya) tells angels O'Reilly (Holly Hunter) and Jackson (Delroy Lindo) to go to Earth to bring two people together, and if they fail cannot return. These two people are Robert Lewis (Ewan McGregor) who lost his job as a janitor to a robot and is mad at his boss Naville (Sir Ian Holm), and the boss's daughter Celine (Cameron Diaz) who Robert kidnaps. Celine realises that Robert isn't experienced in kidnap at all, and she is actually interested in helping him for the money he can demand, so she makes him ask for a high price ransom. As time goes by and they stick together throughout everything the kidnap scenario is fading away as Robert and Celine may be developing feelings for each other, just as Gabriel had planned. O'Reilly and Jackson know that the best way to bring them even closer is to put them in jeopardy, and they get help from Celine's father in order to track them down and do this themselves, but they are foolish in how they do it. There is the point when they have an argument and split apart, and then the angels take Celine in order for Robert to be mad enough to go after her. In the end the dream that Robert had been having for some time about saving the life of Celine indeed becomes reality, and O'Reilly and Jackson return to Heaven as their mission was successful, the happy couple even get married. There is also a short bit of Claymation where we see them retrieve the suitcase of ransom money from earlier on and get a castle in Scotland, and there are bits and pieces of the other characters. Also starring Ian McNeice as Mayhew, Frank Kanig as Ted, Mel Winkler as Francis 'Frank' Naville and Stanley Tucci as Elliot Zweikel. McGregor was reasonable, Diaz was sexy and sassy, Holm got his moments, and Hunter and Lindo were indeed completely miscast, Boyle doesn't quite have a grasp on what to do in each scene, the road movie thing with angels chasing them is alright, overall, it is a film too silly to take seriously, a pretty daft romantic comedy. Adequate! "}]
