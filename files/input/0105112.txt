Apparently a number of people also did since a few sequels followed featuring the main character ex-CIA analyst Jack Ryan, played by Harrison Ford.Sean Bean was excellent as the revenge-obsessed villain, a member of a splinter group, as its labeled not really an IRA extremist, but one too out-of- control for any group. Ford is the man best able to stop him and the film is very interesting start-to-finish and smart enough not to overdo the violence. Suspenseful is probably the best word to describe the movie as Bean goes after Ford's family. Anne Archer, as Ford's wife, along with the rest of the cast, actors such as Patrick Bergen, James Earl Jones, James Fox, Richard Harris and a young Thora Birch make this a well- acted movie.This is simply one of the best thrillers I've ever seen and almost every scene is interesting.

And it's predictable and artless and has plenty of clich√©s.  I make it a point not to read IMDB reviews for a movie until after I've written my own, but even so I can guess that this one has been torn apart on these points probably at least a dozen times.  Now that that's over with, I'm going to admit that I like this movie.  It feels like a tight thriller, good for those nights when I want entertainment with some minor complexity.  I like to go along for the ride, so to speak, even though I know how it ends.  And going back to the first time I saw this, before I'd read the book, I remember being on the edge of my seat quite a bit.Thora Birch does this film a lot of good.  Her expressions and lines are quite well-acted, and she's cute without being syrupy.  Harrison Ford is Harrison Ford; you either like him or you don't, and this movie isn't going to change your  mind (I happen to like him).Don't go renting this one if you want an artsy movie, or a beautiful movie, or a movie with a perfectly tight script.  But if you can enjoy a film for simple entertainment value, and you like Harrison Ford ;), this is a good one for after the kids are in bed.

I don't think this movie was intended to be innovative, to be great, to be memorable.  What it was intended to be was entertaining, and it lived up to this expectation.Harrison Ford is the master of remaining as low-key as possible.  He has had so many films where he can over-emphasize, over-dramatize, and simply over-act.  Ford has the maturity to keep this from happening, and he does so again in this film.  Ford is supported quite well with such actors/actresses as James Earl Jones (reprising his role as Greer from The Hunt for Red October), Samuel L. Jackson, and Anne Archer.  For an action flick, acting is much above average.It was also suspenseful...thrilling.  I thought the ending had a nice build-up and climax.  I realize this is different from the book's ending...but remember, these are two different visions...not the same one. This brings up a big point in movie-watching  Comparing a movie to a book is the worst thing you can do.  They are two completely different genres. More importantly, as I said before, they are two different visions.I'm not a big action fan.  I used to be, but anymore most stories are the same.  To this end I would say Patriot Games is fairly mainstream. However, it was always fun to watch and sometimes thrilling to watch.  I'm also not a big Tom Clancy fan, but I've given the movies based off his books a shot because again they are different visions.  The result is (at least with Patriot Games) a good film to watch on a Saturday night with a bowl of popcorn.  Don't expect great things, but don't expect to be disappointed, either.Rating  7/10 "},{"Title":"Harrison Ford kicks....","Date":"19 January 1999","Score":"26 out of 33 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Thriller","Review":"  Harrison Ford kicks some major butt in this film and proves again that he is the leading action star of his generation.

Unfortunately, a novel adapted to a film will almost never be as good as the book because there just isn't enough time or money to include everything and make everything look as good as it reads. This is evident here. Having said that they certainly didn't leave it to the story to support itself. Impressive heroics from Ford and a superb bad guy performance from Sean Bean (strikingly similar to his performance in the James Bond film Golden Eye) turned Clancy's classy classic book into a classy film. I was also impressed to discover that the director was none other than Australia's Phillip Noyce. As is also sadly common among films made from books, the plot was a little hard to follow due to the audience having to fill in the gaps that were left by the film makers not having time or money to include it all.

The plot is a generic revenge tale, but it takes place within a world that is genuinely interesting CIA conferences, Pentagon back-rooms, high-tech gear, telephone calls from the president etc. Building on the work of political thriller directors like Costa Gavras, Pakula, Frankenheimer, John Schlesinger and Fred Zinnemann, and mainstream novelists like Michael Crichton and Frederick Forsyth in the 70s and Tom Clancy in the 80s, an entire vocabulary was being added to here.Beyond the classy direction and the cool gear on display (the film has 3 good action sequences &#x96; one involving a CIA raid viewed entirely through a spy satellite- a big deal back in 1992), Patriot Games is mildly interesting for a couple other reasons. This is another in a long line of movies in which Harrison Ford finds himself playing a meek everyman who bravely protect his family, and it's funny to see the film's scriptwriters struggling to be politically correct. They want IRA bad guys, but they don't actually want to offend the IRA, so they opt instead for an Irish bad guy who is too hardcore for even the IRA. End result writers able to serve up easy cartoon villains whilst also placating their conscience.More interesting is the way all these films popped up during the First Gulf War. Like an unconscious display of American prowess, in the form of super advanced technology and all seeing surveillance gear, Patriot Games might as well have been an advertisement for the military industrial complex and the long reaching arm of Uncle Sam.In terms of flaws, the film has two at times the villains are pure cartoon and the film's ending features a silly action scene on a boat, hastily tacked on by nervous studio heads. A better director would have extended the action sequence in the house (the film's climax features a battle in a CIA safe house) and omitted the boat sequence entirely.Released 2 years before Patriot Games, The Hunt For Red October trades Gulf War muscle flexing for post Cold War, pro Soviet/American bridge building. But though it pretends to be about the healed wounds between Russia and America, this is still a rather propagandistic flick, about a Russian submarine captain who seeks to defect to the glorious promise land of Uncle Sam. Here, like Patriot Games, a techno-culturally superior America is filled with good leaders and upstanding generals, and Russians would be crazy not to come on over for a slice of freedom.Still, the film was directed by John McTiernan (Die Hard, Predator, Die Hard 3, Thomas Crown Affair &#x96; all good action flicks), so it has a certain style to it. Like Patriot Games, once you get past some clich√©s and some clownishness, it's a rather serious picture with some nice hardware on display for the boys and some well mounted action scenes.Released in 1994, and again directed by Phillip Noyce, Clear and Present Danger is the most sophisticated of these films, which were all based on Tom Clancy novels (Clancy, a major tech-head, fantasises about World War 3 for a living). Here, the world isn't made up of good guys and bad guys and there are lots of conflicting, self interests. The villain here is also nothing less than the President of the United States, a gutsy move, though by now this paternal villain clich√© is getting old (The Fugitive, LA Confidential, Monster's Inc, Minority Report etc). Unusual for such films, Danger points out the immorality of affairs such as Irangate, doesn't salivate over the film's depiction of a secret war in South America (which Noyce links to Vietnam), considers (somewhat) the moral implications of violence, criticises snap emotive responses and deals with political betrayals and private agendas among both the President and his advisers. Where the film differs significantly from its 1970s predecessors, is it's total lack of impotency the 90s spy-hero doesn't shy away from responsibility, and will go so far as to topple the Presidency to maintain the good of his countryWhat's funny, though, is that the film treats its central idea (the President mounting an illegal covert war in Panama) as a shockingly evil thing. In the real world, despite the fact that the American President is not allowed to deploy or instigate any military actions without Congress first declaring war, he routinely does so. Iraq, Vietnam, Korea etc, not to mention countless CIA instigated coups in places like Haiti, Iran, Chile and Ecuador, were all illegal by the Constitution of the United States. The fact is, Congress is always sidestepped, most recently in the bank bailout package fiasco.This being Tom Clancy, the main attraction is once again the gear on display laser guided bombs, F18 hornets, sniper's hidden in the grass, an RPG attack on a convoy etc. From here, many computer game franchises would spawn, and from there, a banalization of military technology. People used to go to these thrillers and marvel at the hardware, gasping at the inside looks offered of the Oval Office and Pentagon, but now such things are routine, countless TV shows (West Wing, 24, The Unit, JAG) and video games (why be wowed by the sniper on screen, when you can BE him online) diluting the spectacle that made these films popular in the 90s.8/10 - With the down sizing of armies around the world, and all technology fetishized to the point of disaffection, the techno-thriller genre (itself a genre borne from war, see Lang's 1928 Spies) looks like it's winding down again.

There's no chance World War III will result from anyone's actions here, but the CIA finds enough bad business coming from the Irish Republican Army to keep itself and those amazing spy satellites it employs busy. Harrison Ford is now Clancy's reliable hero, Jack Ryan, and Ford is a very good fit. In best Clancy fashion, Ryan is a very reluctant hero as well. He hates getting involved in other peoples' affairs and being forced to settle them, just as he hates being forced to kick ass, but what's an ex-Marine CIA agent to do? The villains this time are an ultraviolent faction of the IRA; Ryan gets on their bad side when he busts up an attempt by them to kill the British Home Secretary and his family. The rest of the movie is essentially a tit-for-tat series of confrontations between Ryan/CIA and these IRA murderers. The best scenes in 'Patriot Games' are the action ones, as well as the parts showing the CIA's supersecret and supersophisticated technology at work. Less successful are the scenes having to do with Ryan's home life, and his wife and daughter. There is an upper-class, peachy-keen smugness to them, exemplified by Anne Archer (Cathy Ryan) and her boy, this CIA stuff is a pain in the ass attitude. This type of material is not Clancy's strong suit (or the screenwriter's, apparently) and it shows. The trio of Irish baddies are all portrayed convincingly; Patrick Bergin, Polly Walker, and particularly Sean Bean in a menacing and venomous performance. 'Patriot Games' succeeds mainly because of Harrison Ford's tough, likable, and sometimes vulnerable presence. Several key plot points do not bear close scrutiny; it strikes one as unlikely the IRA and the CIA would take on one another over what is essentially a personal vendetta. But don't think too hard or too much and you'll find 'Patriot Games' a reasonably exciting thriller.

During the ensuing scuffle, Ryan shoots dead one of the terrorists, Patrick Miller. Miller's elder brother Sean is jailed for his part in the attack, but is rescued by his comrades, and vows vengeance on Ryan, who is a former marine and CIA operative. When Ryan realises that Sean Miller is targeting his family he returns to work for the CIA to help with the fight against terrorism. There are a number of fairly obvious goofs and plot holes. No member of the British Royal Family could serve as a Government minister, as they are constitutionally obliged to remain politically neutral. If a foreign citizen were being made a Knight Commander of the Royal Victorian Order (one of the highest awards in the British honours system) he would be invited to a formal ceremony in Buckingham Palace to be knighted by the Queen in person. He would not be presented with the decoration in his own home by a junior member of the Royal Family. It seems unlikely that any Irish republican terror group would carry out an attack on American citizens on American soil, as to do so would risk losing the support their cause has long enjoyed among sections of the Irish-American community. As others have pointed out, it seems illogical for Ryan to take his family to their isolated summer home to get them away from Miller; doubtless the CIA could have found a safer location for them. The film lacks the political implications of Clear and Present Danger, Philip Noyce's next attempt to film a Tom Clancy thriller which involved Watergate-type misconduct by the President and his closest aides. (That film also starred Harrison Ford as Ryan). Despite the involvement of the IRA, Patriot Games makes no attempt to analyse the complexities of the Northern Ireland situation. The film also lacks any detailed characterisation. The moral divisions are straightforward- Ryan, his wife Cathy and his CIA colleagues are good and Miller and his gang are bad.The film does, however, have a strong hero in Harrison Ford. Ford has always been good in the thriller genre, and gives another good performance here as Ryan, combining decency with a strong sense of intelligence. Anne Archer and Sean Bean are also good as Cathy and the villainous Miller. There is a good cameo from Polly Walker as Miller's glamorous but ruthless female associate Annette. Despite the occasional implausibilities of the plot, this is a tense and fast-moving thriller with some good action sequences. It is not Ford's best thriller (that must be either Witness or The Fugitive), but it is nevertheless a good one. 7/10 "},{"Title":"Popcorn political thrills...","Date":"20 February 2008","Score":"3 out of 3 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Thriller","Review":" First of all, I'm not a Tom Clancy fan, only because for whatever reason I've never gotten around to reading any of his books.

I've read almost all of Stephen King's novels, which are also pretty huge, and I'm usually reading three or four at a time. At any rate, I have nothing to offer as far as how closely the movie follows the source material, although I really think this is incredibly important when adapting books to movies.I have read a lot of criticisms of Patriot Games (and even more of the sequel, Clear and Present Danger), and while I agree with mostly all of it, I still think Patriot Games is a good couple hours of good clean cinematic fun. But maybe that's just because I love Harrison Ford. Ebert makes the obvious complaint that Jack Ryan, when he finds himself in danger, sends his family to a remote cabin rather than a secure bunker at CIA headquarters, and it's true that this detracts from the movie, but you have to have a movie somehow, and that's a situation where making the smart, real life decision would cancel out the rest of the movie. If everyone in movies made the smart decision all the time, we wouldn't even have a horror genre, for example.Jack Ryan is described in Clancy's novels as having undistinguished features, which makes Harrison Ford seem to me like the perfect choice to play him, since I've always thought that, even though he's a brilliant and tremendously loved actor, he can't really act with his face very well. Consider one of my favorite examples of this, the close up shot of his face when he sends that kid into surgery in The Fugitive. You can literally see the effort he's putting into making his face do something moving, and it's just not happening. But the thing it, the shot still works. I don't get it, it's a mystery, as Philip Henslowe might say.Harrison Ford has played more complex characters (and less complex, of course), and Jack Ryan gets better than this, but Patriot Games is a fun introduction of Ford playing the role, and is especially a must see for Clancy fans.

Harrison was a perfect fit for this family man, reluctant hero role. He's no super-action hero or martyr, just a man in the wrong place at the wrong time trying to protect his family and prevent the slaughter of innocents. But when the terrorists seek revenge by targeting his family, Jack Ryan is forced to use any means necessary to keep his loved ones safe. Sean Bean plays a convincing villain as usual, donning a convincing Irish accent and his signature sinister expression. His performance was one of his best to date and kudos to Mr. Bean for creating a villain with whom we can sympathize. Anne Archer's character is weak however, typical damsel-in-distress wife and mother relying completely on her husband for protection and having no self-defense skills whatsoever. Thora Birch is adorable in her pre-pubescent innocence. Samuel Jackson as usual does little to step out of his smooth-talking, sarcastic typecast and again plays the same character he plays in every film to date. The film bounces between edge-of-your-seat thriller and slow-moving CIA analysis, but the scenes of action and the superb acting of Harrison Ford more than make up for any slow parts.

Ford is strong as usual. Don't ask me about Tom Clancy or if this movie adapts Clancy's novel firmly, for I haven't read any of Clancy's novels yet. But rating PATRIOT GAMES as a stand-alone flick, I have to say I enjoyed it a lot, a lot more than one might expect from someone who hasn't read its print source. PATRIOT GAMES manages to provide tight, gripping action sequences amidst its political theme. In other words, its both fun and dead serious on its plot at the same amount of screen time.Taking over for Alec Baldwin who played the role in the first film THE HUNT FOR RED October, Harrison Ford plays Jack Ryan, Clancy's brain child CIA agent, who is sent on vacation by the CIA. When meeting his wife (Anne Archer) and daughter (Thora Birch) in front of Buckingham Palace, he must thwart an assassination attempt on Lord Holmes (James Fox), a member of the Royal Family, by a band of Irish Terrorists. Thru this heroic act, Ryan becomes a public hero, but also the number one target of one of the terrorists (Sean Bean), who bears a grudge when Ryan kills his brother during his heroic attempt. Now, Ryan is back on the CIA and taking on one of the most dangerous mission in his life and career, to save his family.Much of the first things I give this film credit for is the excellent performances. Of course, there's Ford, in perhaps one of his best roles, Archer as a grief-stricken wife who delivers excellent drama in the face of danger. Bean, as well, makes a compelling villain. The supporting cast (including Patrick Bergin as one of the terrorists, Richard Harris as an IRA symphatizer and James Earl Jones as Admiral Greer) add great background characters don't aren't just decorations.One of the best things about the film is how it was shoot. The film is terrifically photographed by Donald McAlpine. This was mostly evident during the opening sequences, the shots of the vibrant desert sands, most especially the chase sequences. Mixed it with Philip Noyce tightly-knit direction and an intelligent script by W. Peter Iliff and Donald Stewart, it makes a film that both looks and feels good.Even considered by Clancy purists as the weakest Clancy adaptation, PATRIOT GAMES is still tight, seat-gripping entertainment that's both entertaining to watch and still doesn't fail to deliver its message.Rating ****1/2 out of 5.

Harrison Ford is Jack Ryan, the CIA analyst sought by terrorist Sean Miller, played by Sean Bean. Harrison Ford is the definitive Jack Ryan and brings more force to the role than Alec Baldwin or Ben Affleck. Sean Bean is also solid as Ryan's terrorist nemesis. The film had a notable supporting cast including James Earl Jones, Richard Harris, James Fox, Hugh Fraser and Samuel L. Jackson.The film is generally fast-paced and has some decent action sequences. It is interesting to see the technology used behind the scenes at the CIA. However, the film's primary weakness it its story. There is little story development beyond the terrorist seeking revenge premise and the characters are less interesting and developed than they could be. This makes Patriot Games is overall an average thriller, albeit with an outstanding cast. I'd recommend Clear and Present Danger (1994) instead of this for a Tom Clancy adaptation featuring Harrison Ford as Ryan because its story and characters are better developed.

On a working-vacation trip to London with his wife (Anne Archer) and precocious daughter, Sally (Thora Birch), Jack gives a lecture to members of the British intelligence. He is to join his wife and daughter later, meeting near Buckingham palace. As fate would have it, a violent faction of the IRA is lurking near the royal residence, too, hoping to kidnap a member of the monarchy. They nearly succeed but are thwarted when Jack, acting only as a concerned bystander, shoots one of the bad guys. The others flee, except for the brother of the slain terrorist. His name is Sean (Sean Bean) and he is arrested on the spot and, eventually, brought to trial, where Ryan must give testimony. Although Sean is given a long prison sentence, he vows to get even with Ryan for killing his baby brother. Should Jack be worried? Well, prison breaks do occur, don't they? This is an action film that delivers big thrills. First, the cast is great, as Ford is perfect as the thinking-man's undercover agent and Archer terrific as the supportive wife. Thora Birch, in one of her first big roles, is amazing as the very bright, very adorable young daughter. Then, too, Bean is downright frightening as the malevolent IRA terrorist, with Patrick Bergen and Polly Walker (what an aboutface from Enchanted April!) on hand to scare us as well. The sets, costumes, stunts, direction, and production are all very fine. In addition, the script, based on the Tom Clancy book, is a stunner. While the whole world is hoping that peace, thank God, is truly breaking out in Northern Island, this is a look at what the IRA was. But, in reality, it doesn't matter who the terrorists are in the realm of this motion picture. The film is a thrilling cat and mouse game, of good guys against the bad guys, with the outcome far from certain until the last few exciting minutes. Trust me. If you have never seen this action-packed film, you have been missing something very special, absolutely.

A captured IRA terrorist is Sean Bean, whose brother Harrison has just killed in self defense, and Bean will never give up his quest for revenge on Ryan and his family.It's always interesting to see what kind of heavy a movie gives us. The heavies are a chronicle of the times. In this instance it's unlikely that a story from Tom Clancy, a robustly nationalistic Irish-American novelist who plays with guns, is going to paint the Irish Revolutionary Army red, for reasons both sentimental and commercial. Nope. The gang that's after Harrison Ford and his kin are an OFFSHOOT of the IRA. It's a splinter group, see. Not the actual IRA. This splinter groups is so mean that they kill an IRA chief who tries to restrain them. And as if that weren't enough, Sean Bean turns out to be too evil even for the ultra-violent splinter group (as Ford describes them). Bean is an iconoclastic loony who shoots the members of his own splinter group when they try to dissuade him from killing Ford. Bean's group has one member, himself. I guess that should put enough distance between the evil Sean Bean, on the one hand, and the Auld Sod on the other.After the initial violent encounter, the movie turns into a game of cat and mouse, with Bean the cat and Ryan the mouse. Bean escapes from captivity, pursues Ryan to Annapolis, and tries to kill everyone in sight. The climactic fight is done by the number in typical action movie style. Two speedboats on rough seas in the middle of the night during a thunderstorm. Bean as the pursuer produces a submachine gun and kills has compadres, then takes off after Ford in HIS boat. Bean sprays the other boat with lead. Tears it to shreds and sets some convenient tanks of gasoline afire, but misses Ford. Pursuer leaps onto burning boat at top speed, which is unforgivable if only because it lends itself to such an appalling pun (jumping bean). In mano a mano combat, Ford (a CIA bookworm and schoolteacher) whips tough, highly trained Bean. Ford jumps off boat at last minute. Flaming boat with wounded Bean smashes into some rocks and explodes. Ford get medal, settles on couch back at home and hugs wife and daughter to him.The best scene in the movie shows us the CIA officials watching an infra-red live satellite feed of an attack on a terrorist training camp in Libya. The good little green dots sneak up on the sleeping bad little green dots. They make all the bad dots stop moving. Then a green helicopter comes in and the buildings in the camp blow up in big green flares. All we see are the satellite feeds and the tense faces of the viewers, including Ford's. Ford gulps as he watches the bad dots get murdered and blown to smithereens. Watching total strangers die seems to make him uncomfortable and, who knows, maybe a little guilty.What do we know about those terrorist camps anyway? Who teaches whom, and what do they teach? Do the Red Brigade and The Shining Path and the IRA and all these groups that are essentially irrelevant to one another, if not at odds, actually come together for a greater cause? What's the cause? What do they learn at a desert training camp that they couldn't learn more comfortably in a flat in the city? Target practice? Is that IT? Clancy had his fingers on the pulse of a nuclear submarine in The Hunt for Red October. A techie manque reveled in the details.But all of this is more conventional stuff. It's a more personal story with a more generic villain. We don't learn much more than those trainees at the terrorist camps learn. In the end this is mostly recycled stuff from other action movies. In fact, this is the second time that I can remember Ann Archer getting into a car accident in an attempt to protect her daughter and coming up with nothing more than a becoming bruise on her eye. (The other scene is in Basic Instinct.) And Ford has a fist fight with a young terrorist, during which Ford is repeatedly punched in the face and body, and he emerges with a trickle of blood from one nostril and a similar trickle from the corner of his lips. Didn't ANYONE involved in this -- makeup or writers -- ever watch a fist fight in elementary school? A punch in the nose doesn't result in a trickle of blood from one nostril. It leads to a gusher that splashes down your shirtfront, and when you try to wipe it away it leaves your face smeared. (See Shane for a good example.) As an ordinary action film it's not bad. Harrison Ford plays Jack Ryan as quiet and modest, but flawless too. In The Hunt for Red October the character had a fear of flying and that made him human like the rest of us. No such blemish mars the hero of this entertaining but routine action movie.

Suddenly his whole family is in danger because the IRA guys want revenge and Ryan needs get back to his old CIA ways to be able to defend his wife and daughter. While Patriot Ganes is a well-made film, it lacks the oomph of most of Ford's other action films and I found myself truly unable to get into the plot at several points.Had it not been for Ford's imprinted 'good guy' status and emotive eyes, I would probably have pulled for the 'bad guys' in Patriot Games, because Sean Bean has never been sexier than in this film. What stuck with me besides rentable bad guy Sean Bean, was an interesting use of an Enya song during one murder in the beginning.Patriot Games is possibly heavier on the thriller part than the action because, frankly, not much happens during long segments of the film. This would be fine as a means to build up tension in the plot, but there are never any satisfying culminations to follow the slow, suspenseful pace until the very end--and these scenes can hardly be labeled as satisfying.

Not an action fan after all, I guess I even like the action in this movie. It fits. It is not only action, you also have to think, some intelligence is required to understand the plot. But it's not too complicated or too realistic either. It's a good story managing to build up great suspense and to deserve the rating well-done, intelligent thriller(8 out of 10).OK, there is something special about the movie - concerning the way Jack Ryan's (Harrison Ford) family is involved in the conflict. Commonly, when family matters and emotions are shown in movies they get so kitschy that it really hurts. Not so here. Instead this fake sentimental attitude towards family matters is made a subject in a few dialogues here. The Polly Walker character says something like The Americans hold their breath when a little girl sprains her ankles in P.E. lessons and Jack Ryan says (roughly)Do you want me to give the media what they want? Let their camera teams into my daughter's hospital room?. That's the truth. In Patriot Games these emotions are acted out very unobtrusively, yet with no doubt touching and believeable.It is not the main point of the movie, which IS an action thriller, but I think it's quite honorable.Harrison Ford, as the main character, is a very believeable actor. Cast him and a movie that can't be perfect will be as good as it can get. Sean Bean makes a great psycho - there seem to be actors who are born for roles like this, he may be one. And now I have to make references to other movies Thora Birch, who plays Ryan's daughter is a brilliant talent - I recommend you the movie Paradise in order to convince yourself.

I usually watch this film once every 3-4 weeks, and I never get sick of it! There are not many other films that are so addictive you can watch it over and over again and not get sick of it, so this is a rarity coming from the beginning of the 90s. (other addictive films include 'Romancing the Stone', 'Die Hard' and 'A Fish Called Wanda') The cast for the film is superb! Ford is great as Ryan, who is relieving Alec Baldwin after 'Hunt For Red October'. Also, the main villain Sean Bean is terrific! Bean is one of the best actors on the face of this planet, but I still find it weird that girls drool over him, and say he's sexy! Creepy! Bean has done many different accents so believably in films, for example in this film he's pure Irish, but in 'Goldeneye' he was British, and sounded completely different! Bean always makes a good villain, but it's not compulsory to kill him in every film he's in! (the only films I've seen when he stays alive is 'Troy' and 'Flightplan'. In both those films he was an ally. Thank god!) Other members of the supporting cast, like Richard Harris, James Earl Jones and Samuel L. Jackson add to the addictiveness of this film, and they're all astoundingly great actors (God rest Harris, he will be missed!).The basic plot follows Ford as an Ex-CIA agent named Jack Ryan, who goes to London to make a speech, but when he meets up with his family after his speech he foils an attempt to assassinate the royal family, carried out by nefarious Irish terrorists! During the foiling of the attack the head terrorist Sean Miller (Bean) is captured, but his little brother is killed by Ryan. Miller swears revenge on Ryan. Miller is sent to prison for the assassination attempt, but his fellow terrorist buddies rescue him, so Miller has one more shot at assassinating the royal family, and to get revenge on Ryan! After Miller continually tries to get revenge on Ryan, his family still stands, but now Ryan is besotted with finding Miller, and stopping the Irish terrorist! Hence and action packed ending, that has some great action, and some great acting! This film is a must-see, is makes a great night at the movies, and is one of the highest recommended Ford films I've ever watched.10/10, a worthy film!

However when the brother of one of the terrorists swears revenge on Ryan, he is forced to rejoin Admiral Greer's CIA in order to track down and capture Miller and the others who are in the IRA. The plot to this is full of ridiculous points - the shoot out in front of Parliament, the fudging of the IRA issues right through to Ryan being decorated on behalf of Britain in his living room. The plot is too scared to upset the Irish audience in making sure that it's not the IRA that's doing it - instead it's a group that is 'too crazy for the IRA'. This allows some of the IRA members to be shown as kindly old men etc (Richard Harris) without them being associated with Sean Beam's murderers. The story is very daft and is only an excuse for set pieces and action. It's all very daft and it is just a shame that no-one tried to make the plot stand up for itself.Ford just does his standard 'normal man in heroic situation' stuff and doesn't do anything special. Bean is good but is lumbered with a poor role and bad dialogue. Bergin is also stuck in the same boat. Jackson, James Earl Jones, Fox and Harris all add a touch of class to this that it patently doesn't deserve to have.The film is almost insulting in it's attempts to turn terrorists into good men, and blame any trouble on people outside the main IRA who are too crazy to be members of this fine upstanding organisation! None of the terrorist groups are honourable. If a splinter group exists it is not because they were 'too violent' or 'too crazy' to be part of the main group, but because the main group wants to be able to claim peace while still condoning violence. For example the protestant terrorists use splinter groups called 'The red hand defenders' while the IRA hide behind 'the continuity IRA' 'the real IRA' or any other name that comes to mind. A film that thinks that members are too crazy is clearly doesn't want to let the facts get in the way of a story.Overall this is so daft that I'm surprised it ever got OK'd to be made. Alec Baldwin played Ryan in 'Hunt for Red October' and missed out here because of high wage demands compared to a low star rating. I imagine he watched this and thanked God that he hadn't signed anything binding.

But no I was wrong. For the best of the bunch is undoubtedly 'Patriot Games'.Not many movies have the ability to hold your attention for 2 hours. Keep you on the edge of your seat. Biting your nails. You know the drill. But Patriot Games does more than that It leaves you wanting more. The plot is solid and flawless with Ford playing an ex-CIA man Jack Ryan who becomes a hero when he intercepts a kidnapping and kills one of the men. Unfortunately for Ford, this man has a brother who vows to avenge him, no matter what the cost.And so ensues a cat and mouse chase between hero and villain. This is a tried and tested formula. It either goes perfectly , e.g 'speed' or horribly wrong such as 'the contract'. What distinguishes one from the other is the villain. A good villain will be brutal, relentless , have clear objectives and the ability to send shivers down your spine. Sean Bean, who plays the villain in this movie, has the unique power of being able to encompass all four. He has a true natural presence on screen and actually matches Ford ; both having strong characters.The 80's/90's was a defining era for action movies. We saw classics such as Terminater, Die hard and the untouchables. Patriot games could have and probably would have gone wrong with a different pair of leads. But the performances of Ford and Bean are so strong that this movie is definitely up with the best. A must-see!

Well, what do you know, he successfully disarms the terrorists, killing in the process the 17-year old brother of Sean Miller (Sean Bean), while the others manage to escape. Ryan instantly makes it to the top of Miller's enemy list and we understand it's only a matter of time before we get a hand-to-hand confrontation.The time is 100 minutes during which Philp Noyce's Patriot Games fulfills every premise of an action/thriller the bad guy's escape, the cowardly attack on Ryan's wife and daughter, a failed (but alarming) one on Ryan, and a cat-and-mouse chase via such exciting tools as political surveillance, mug shots, satellites and glimpses of memory. And after having initially declined the offer, Ryan finally accepts to get back to the CIA (all it took was to measure up how serious the threat against his family was). These are predictable elements meaning to provide the perfect dosage of adrenalin and suspense but what makes them work is the 'intelligence' involved in Ryan's quest for Miller, making him more of a thinker than a typical physical hero. The script insists enough on Ryan's expertise as an analyst.And there is the whole political back-story, as if the so-called Patriot Games were not without rules, one of them being an understandable yet redundant bit of correctness. Basically, Noyce is extremely careful on depicting the villainous group as an independent and more fanatic branch of the Irish Republican Army lead by O'Donnell (Patrick Bergin) who was part of the initial attack. It's comprehensible for a film with international ambitions to play on the safe side not to lose the Irish audience, but we get the point more than needed. One of the IRA leaders is brutally killed in his bed, by O'Donnell's sexy girlfriend (Polly Walker) and the same O'Donnell kills a friend at short range, so the distance between the IRA and the bad guys is clearly and categorically established. Yet did these precautions matter? For all the political context the script provides, it all leads up to the 'personal' story between Miller and Ryan, Miller who didn't give a damn about fighting for Ireland as soon as his brother hit the ground. Did it also matter when the portrayal of Arabs was more careless? After all, just put your terrorists in any desert camp in 'North Africa' (no need to specify the exact location), throw a name like Gaddafi (Saddam works sometimes) and that's it. I was glad there wasn't any character wearing a red Saudi top hat and shouting some Arab gibberish, to provide the little touch of authenticity. As usual, it's a camp in Libya and like all the camps in Libya, the one that welcomed the bad guys had to be bombed (recent events proved that reality could go that far).Still, it was a nice touch to show the perplexed face of Harrison Ford, during the camp's bombing, looking from infrared screens, wounded 'terrorist' dragging their way out from fire. His reaction to one of the young upstarts uttering an enthusiastic Now, that's a kill while sipping coffee, says it all, the man has gotten soft, which means in our language, more 'human' and we understand how his 'family' lifestyle turned him into a thinker. And this is the sympathetic little twist Patriot Games gives us, a different Harrison Ford character, sweeter, gentler, only using force in case of necessary defense. In one of the film's boldest moves, he's prevented from a certain death by a Naval guard. This shows how vulnerable he truly is and how even his determination isn't enough to avoid the worst. Another effective moment consisted on a shot on his face while he stares at a thick cloud of smoke coming from the freeway, indicating that a car (not any car) had crashed. This is certainly one of the film's most haunting moments as you can read the desperation of a man who realizes that his loved ones are also part of these damn games (although you wonder why they planned to kill him since killing his family and letting him live with that would have been enough a revenge) Patriot Games doesn't bring much freshness to the genre but surprisingly offers a hero who's not your typical cynical macho guy, with marital troubles. Ryan has a beautiful and devoted wife. I could have said that Anne Archer seemed to reprise her role from Fatal Attraction, but the whole film borrows elements from Adrian Lyne's classic, like the car-accident, the big isolated family house, becoming ominous under a stormy night and the mandatory daughter.Indeed, like for every family in trouble, it's a girl that accentuates the defenselessness when family comedies have young boys who wish their daddies would spend more time with them. But Thora Birch manages to appear like a smart but not precocious girl. The whole 'family' vibes feeling is clearly palpable all through the film, and it's pleasantly surprising how it is used even during the few exchanges with the intimidating James Earl Jones and Jack's buddy, played by a friendlier Samuel L. Jackson. Naturally, there is not much family feeling when the climax starts, especially when you got a fight in a speeding boat on fire about to hit rocks, a move that disappointed many Tom Clancy readers.Speaking for me, I've never read Clancy, never saw Hunt for Red October either (but I'm looking forward to seeing it) so all I had were reverse expectations, I thought I was going to see an action-packed movie starring a super-heroic Harrison Ford, and I was pleasantly surprised by how intelligent and family oriented he was.

Some serious off-key location shooting for scenes in Britain provide amusement, particularly a scene clear showing the Transporter Bridge in Middlesbrough which I've seen up close and personal. Rather out of the way considering Sean Bean's character was being transported from London to the Isle of Wight... Then there are the usual national archetypes.While the film does cop out a bit by inventing a Royal Family member for the bad guys to target, and doing away with the black militants in the book who help out the bad guys, on it's own terms, it manages to be an effective thriller, with some standout moments that will have your heart in your throat. The best part of the film depicts an SAS raid, as seen by infrared satellite, and we see some of the CIA guys not even bat an eyelid, giving dry commentary while watching real people being killed on live transmission. The climactic boat chase maybe more appropriate for a Hollywood action film than a Tom Clancy thriller, it does get the blood pumping.

Once all the difficult elements of such a film were brought together, as happened in the case of Ben Hur and Spartacus with their spectacular elements, other directors were quick to adopt and extend the techniques pioneered in the original work. This film from author and prolific thriller icon Tom Clancy, was more than a show of special effects, I suggest; it is unusually filled with interesting characters for an adventure of any sort; and director Philip Noyce, working from an honest treatment of the original novel achieved by W. Peter Ili and Donald Stewart was able to keep the clarity of the storyline, in my estimation, moving forward at all points. The feature's cinematography by Donald M. McAlpine and Stephen Smith with art direction by Joseph P. Lucky and production design by Joseph Nemec III) and music by James Horner, worked together quite seamlessly despite the complexity of its presenting a variety of settings, types of scenes, lighting levels and various-sized images. The final battle that decides the outcome of a lengthy duel between Jack Ryan and an Irish terrorist obsessed with his destruction has to be seen to be appreciated, on several levels. In the role of Ryan, Harrison Ford must be lover, father, PhD level professor, friend, ex-CIA analyst, ordinary citizen, and extraordinary hero; by my standards, he does very well with all of these challenges; what sets this film above for instance the comparable Da Vinci Code is that Ford played a professor successfully and the other film's lead did everything well except that classically-trained actor's challenge. Anne Archer as Ford's wife is mature, and adequate, no more. James Earl Jones is a fine presence as The Admiral in charge of secret operations; Richard Harris has a nice role as a high-ranking IRA leader; James Fox plays a high-ranking Brit powerfully; and the villains in the piece, IRA types, spies on both sides and medical personnel, etc. whether killing, saving, reporting, criticizing or being killed, are all above average or better in skill. The interiors are believable; the psychology of the characters convinced me as a writer at every point. The cross-training and tensions going on between international terrorist groups alone stamps this as a ground-breaking storyline, with its implications of a breakdown of general World order and the heralding of a new Age, only two years distant at that time. The special effects, stunts, visuals and international locations made the film seem to this viewer admirable thought out and realistic at every point. This film is superior to the showier Goldfinger; without its example, I assert that National Treasure and other techno-thrillers could not have been done as well as they eventually were.

Patriot Games is, apparently, the follow up to the 1990 film 'The Hunt For Red October' - I haven't seen it, but to me this film stands up pretty well on it's own so I don't think that is a problem. Patriot Games is a pretty tight little thriller which holds up well despite some questionable plot points and some rather unbelievable goings on. The plot focuses on Clancy protagonist Jack Ryan, a former CIA man holidaying in Britain. He happens to be around when some IRA terrorists make an assassination attempt on some member of the royal family, and thwarts the attack by killing one terrorist and letting the other be apprehended by the police. The remaining man is Sean Miller, and he's not too happy about the death of the other terrorist as it happens to have been his brother. A personal vendetta is then sworn as the terrorist seeks revenge.The film benefits from a decent cast. Harrison Ford isn't the best actor of all time, and here he pretty much sleepwalks through the film (as usual), but somehow he has great screen presence, and since this thriller doesn't exactly demand high quality acting; he fits the role just fine. Sean Bean is his opposite number. Bean is an actor I've never really liked, but he does play villains well, and he manages to make the audience believe that he is hell-bent on revenge. The rest of the film is made up with good support turns from the likes of Samuel l. Jackson, Thora Birch, Anne Archer and James Earl Jones. Apparently, the film puts an untrue spin on terrorist groups; but my advice with regards to that is just ignore it and enjoy the action. There's a fair amount of action too, as the film features car chases, shootouts and various fistfights. It does take a while for Patriot Games to get going; about an hour in fact, but it's not boring at any point, and therefore makes for good entertainment throughout.

Patriot Games is one of them.The storyline is quite simple Jack Ryan (Harrison Ford), former CIA analyst, is on vacation/lecture tour in England with his family. While on the way to meet them near Buckingham Palace, he & his family are caught in a cross-fire during an assassination attempt on a member of the Royal Family, Lord Holmes (Edward Fox), by a rogue faction of the IRA led by Sean Miller (Sean Bean). In the ensuing shoot-out, Jack killed one the terrorists, who happens to be Sean's younger brother. Jack gets drawn back into the CIA after the terrorists set out a vengeful attack against his family back in USA.In my view, the action sequences in this movie are not very exciting, when compared with any of the recent Bond &/or Bourne movies, although the entire movie is quite entertaining. I particularly enjoyed the sequence showing a real-time satellite-tracking session at CIA HQ, during which Jack & his counter-terrorism team are watching a crack SAS team conducting a black ops raid at the terrorists' hideout somewhere in Libya. The accompanying music score is realistically haunting! What excites me most about this movie is watching Jack exercising his astute power of observation & his uncanny ability to juxtapose images in a relentless attempt to track down the whereabout of the rogue faction of the IRA,...with the high-tech resources of CIA's counter-terrorism group, of course.Using vital information secured from Paddy O'Neil (Richard Harris), an IRA supporter in the USA, Jack narrows down the search through his observation/juxtaposition of CIA's satellite images (which includes an overhead snapshot of an apparently capped woman with a pony tail) with his own recalled images - a back-view glimpse of the pony-tailed driver in the terrorists' getaway vehicle during the foiled assassination attempt in England; - a side-view glance of the pony-tailed driver in the terrorists' getaway vehicle during an unsuccessful assassination attempt on his life outside the US Naval Academy; All these associations have been triggered while taking a break & walking pass a pony-tailed woman employee on the way to answer the call of nature at CIA Headquarters.What a brilliant piece of detective work - observation plus juxtaposition - on the part of Jack! The Power of Observation & Juxtaposition are obviously requisite character traits of a CIA analyst.In summing up this review, I have enjoyed very much watching Patriot Games, experientially as well as educationally. This is another wonderful addition to my resource repertoire.

We last met Ryan in The Hunt For Red October two years earlier in the person of Alec Baldwin. Baldwin was offered the role in this film, but to his everlasting regret, turned it down and Harrison Ford as a more mature Ryan was cast in the role. This story focuses more on the perils of Ryan and his family rather than espionage.Jack Ryan (Ford), a college professor, his wife Sally (Anne Archer), who is also a doctor, and their daughter Sally (Thora Birch) are in Britain for Jack's speaking engagement. As they meet thereafter, they stumble upon a plot by a breakaway sect of the Irish Republican Army (IRA), to murder Lord William Holmes (James Fox) a member of the British Royal Family. The group is led by Kevin O'Donnell (Patrick Bergin) and includes his girl friend Annette (Polly Walker), Sean Miller (Sean Bean) and his brother Paddy (Karl Hayden).Ryan instinctively jumps into the action and foils the assassination plot killing young Paddy Miller and capturing his brother Sean. Sean Miller is distraught over his kid brother's death and vows revenge on Ryan and his family.The Ryans return to their home in Maryland and Jack returns to his job as a professor at the US Naval Academy, Annapolis. All is going well until Miller escapes from custody and is consumed with hatred for Ryan, the man who killed his brother.Admiral Greer (James Earl Jones) and Marty Cantor (J.E. Freeman) visit Ryan's home and inform him of Miller's escape and try to entice him back to the CIA. Ryan refuses. Miller, O'Donnell et al turn up in the US and try to kill Jack but fail. Miller attacks Cathy and Sally in their car causing a crash in which both are injured. This angers Jack who then decides that the best way to fight these people is with the resources of the CIA, so he returns to the organization.A senior IRA representative, Paddy O'Neal (Richard Harris), in the US on a fund raising effort, swears that the IRA was not responsible for the attacks on Lord Holmes and Ryan and his family. Ryan forces O'Neal to reveal the identity of the mysterious woman (annette) whom Ryan saw when the attempt was made on his life, in return for Ryan's not blackballing the IRA.Ryan analyzes the available data and tries to locate the group's training facilities by satellite. The British meanwhile, suspect that there is an insider on Lord Holmes' staff who provides the terrorists with information on his itinerary.As it happens, Lord Holmes will be in the US on a certain date and wants to present Ryan with an award for saving his life. Since Ryan is planning a party for the return home of his injured daughter, Lord Holmes is invited to attend. The terrorists get wind of this, attack the party, killing the guards and.....................................Ford makes an excellent Jack Ryan. He brings a maturity and vulnerability to the role that was lacking in Baldwin. Anne Archer is the perfect foil for him as his wife. Sean Bean almost steals the picture as the hate obsessed terrorist Sean Miller. Bergin and Walker as well, make scary villains as well. Samuel L. Jackson appears as Ryan's friend from Annapolis Lt. Cmmdr. Robby Jackson.Followed by A Clear and Present Danger (1994).

I looked at the tennis court of my new American Intelligence friend and realized that American Intelligence Community employees are winners at the game of life. I wanted to be a winner too. Immediately after honourably retiring from the Canadian forces I began informing for the CIA. I joke that I am the Omega Wolf of the American Intelligence Community. Surprisingly you have more contact with Russian and Chinese people when they know that you are American Intelligence.

In some respects, it is an improvement on The Hunt for Red October, particularly when it comes to the pacing, while in others it is not on the same level in that it is more plot based than character based. Clancy disowned the film before it was released and it was criticised for departing too much from the novel but, since I have never read any of his work, I can only comment on the film itself. It has a great script by W. Peter Iliff and Donald Stewart and the director Phillip Noyce proves even more adept than John McTiernan at creating and maintaining tension. Since I am from Ireland, I don't watch films about the Troubles too often since I vividly remember watching news reports about them every other week when I was a child in the 1990s but the film handles the material in a skillful way. I was delighted that it portrayed the IRA in an extremely negative fashion.The film stars Harrison Ford as Jack Ryan, succeeding his Working Girl co-star Alec Baldwin in the role. Ford had originally been offered it in The Hunt for Red October but he turned it down, incidentally. In the seven years since the events of the previous film, Ryan has retired from the CIA and works full-time as a professor of history at the US Naval Academy in Annapolis, Maryland. While on holiday in London, he prevents a splinter group of the Provisional IRA from assassinating Lord William Holmes, the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland and the Queen Mother's cousin. In the process, Ryan kills a 16-year-old Provo named Patrick Miller. As a result, Miller's elder brother Sean swears revenge on not only Ryan but his wife Cathy and daughter Sally. Ford gives a very convincing performance as Ryan, bringing his own special brand of charisma to the role. He is very effective in both the scenes in which Ryan uses his considerable intelligence and expertise and the more action-orientated ones. However, one manner in which the film is lacking compared to its predecessor is that Ryan is not as compelling a protagonist as Captain Marko Ramius, played funnily enough by Ford's erstwhile on screen father Sean Connery.In the previous film, we only caught a glimpse of Ryan's family and home life but it plays a major larger role on this occasion. The underrated Anne Archer is very good as Cathy and she and Ford are very believable as a married couple. Cathy is a strong character and, while her life is put in danger several times, she never seems like a damsel in distress in contrast to the character's depiction in Jack Ryan Shadow Recruit. Thora Birch, one of the best American child actors of her generation, is perfectly cast as the adorable Sally. Sally is severely injured as a result of one of Miller's attacks and her spleen is subsequently removed. Putting children in danger can sometimes be a cheap, manipulative trick but the matter is handled about as well as it could be here. Sally's condition strengthens Ryan's resolve so it is at least significant to the plot. Sean Bean is quite good as Miller, not the most interesting character in the film, but his Northern Irish accent is very variable. As a matter of fact, I was not particularly impressed by any of the Irish accents on display from the predominantly non-Irish cast members. The most notable Irish cast member is Richard Harris who is excellent in the comparatively small role of Paddy O'Neil, a Sinn F√©in representative who is attempting to drum up support and, more importantly, money for his cause in the US. He repeatedly tells the media that the attempts on the lives of Lord Holmes and the Ryans were not sanctioned by the IRA and, for once, he is telling the truth. As Ryan points out, he is essentially the Boy Who Cried Wolf when it comes to such matters so it is not a surprise that the media does not believe. His fellow Irishman Patrick Bergin also gives a great performance as Kevin O'Donnell, who attempts to be the voice of reason - not usually a description that I would apply to the IRA - when it comes to Miller. The only other well known Irish actor in the film is Jonathan Ryan as the IRA brigade commander Jimmy O'Reardon. The cynical part of me - which is most of me, frankly - is inclined to think that Ryan was cast because of his resemblance to Gerry Adams. It was a little surreal seeing him play an IRA terrorist because he used to present the iconic Irish kids' show Bosco. It's a bit like a Blue Peter presenter or Mr. Rogers playing a terrorist. The film also features strong performances from James Fox (who replaced his elder brother Edward) as Lord Holmes, James Earl Jones (the sole returning cast member from The Hunt for Red October) as Admiral James Greer, Alun Armstrong and Polly Walker. Oh, and it was nice to see Gerald Sim pop up in a film not directed by his brother-in-law Richard Attenborough!Overall, this is an extremely effective thriller and a worthy sequel to The Hunt for Red October, which I enjoyed only marginally more than this film.

His escape could have been a great car chase but it's surprisingly static. Other than the cold blooded killings, there's nothing interesting there. Even Jack and Cathy's phone call before the crash could have been more intense. He has literally escaped death and yet he's so coy about the danger. I do like the section where he's looking for the terrorists in North Africa with the satellite. It's cerebral and probably the most memorable part of the movie.

Clearly, the latter category is very wide in his hands. Probably in mine too, but I wouldn't classify this movie as neo-noir. I'll get tougher eventually after I've seen more of the films called neo-noir and make a list of those I consider to be genuine. When I think of neo-noirs from the time period of this movie, I think of really good ones like Deep Cover (1992) and Q & A (1990). Patriot Games (1992) is an entirely different kind of movie.This movie is an action-thriller, a standard one at that. It's a basic revenge story. Ford, a former CIA agent, happens to be on the spot when a radical splinter group of the IRA goes against the IRA agenda and tries to assassinate members of the royal family. Ford intervenes. In the process he kills the younger brother of Sean Bean, a terrorist. Bean takes it into his head to gather his buddies, cross the ocean to Maryland, and dispose of Ford and family. The story gets sidetracked in Act 2 when Ford returns to the CIA fold. That's Tom Clancy's forte, I read, and may explain this part of the movie. Nevertheless, a paean to the capabilities of the CIA and a sequence involving the destruction of a terrorist training camp, seen only on monitors at Langley that illustrates a kind of push button warfare, adds nothing to the story of Bean's deadly attempts. We know what the outcome is going to be, because this movie is not neo-noir. The family man will protect the integrity of his family, even though his daughter has lost her spleen. The CIA will be your friendly, avuncular and intelligent entity represented by James Earl Jones, fully capable of turning off his Darth Vader switch. The good IRA guys represented by Richard Harris will even help Ford identify the bad IRA guys. Anne Archer will be all smiles to have her husband back and to be ready to give birth to a new family member, whose sex will remain a secret known only to Ford, Archer and their daughter, unless the screenwriter has spilled the beans somewhere else.

In The Hunt for Red October, his first appearance on screen, Alec Baldwin played him almost as an innocent, albeit a highly intelligent one. He was bright-eyed, often smiling, and joked privately to himself about the people he'd had to deal with. In the next two Ryan movies, Harrison Ford went in a different direction by giving the character Ford's own trademark scowl and seething brusqueness. Ford is entertaining enough in Patriot Games, and he can convey a lot with that scowl, or with a finger raised threateningly, but it must be admitted that a lot of action movies are helmed by characters much like his. And that's no surprise, because Ford himself played a lot of them. Compared to the strategic chess game of Red October, then, Patriot Games feels routine and even simple. Ryan's family, which includes his medical doctor wife (Anne Archer) and a daughter played by Thora Birch, a veritable acting prodigy for her young age, is targeted by a rogue IRA terrorist seeking vengeance for a perceived wrong. This personalized attack provokes Ryan to seek vengeance in return, and suddenly we have a vendetta movie that might as well star anyone other than CIA analyst Jack Ryan. The not-quite-IRA terrorists also hang around with some vaguely middle-eastern terrorists for no clear reason, which means that despite some over-the-top Irishness from the likes of Richard Harris the bad guys might as well be anybody, too. There may be something to the idea of using Ryan's family to illustrate the fact that terrorists in general, unlike Soviets or other more conventional enemies, intentionally and indiscriminately target civilians and families, but that's not really what's going on in Patriot Games. Here it's specifically and exclusively Ryan's family members who are targets, and that's a far more lazy, manipulative way of generating stakes than the intricate plotting of Red October. To be clear, Patriot Games is far from dislikable; it's an effective, even a good, mainstream thriller. It's just a bit disappointing to see Jack Ryan, our formerly wonky history teacher, turn into the kind of film character who goes around settling personal scores with his fists, his guns, and the occasional explosion.

But Patriot Games felt more like a Harrison Ford vehicle than a literary character adaptation. For me, at least. And there's an emphasis in this movie on Ryan as man of domesticity that tends to detract from my enjoyment (I speak mostly of that contrived saccharine ending). That said, it's certainly not without its pluses. There's some nice direction, and Phillip Noyce ups the tension during the action scenes (particularly during the third act showdown and boat chase). The scene with the CIA watching the camp raid via satellite maintains a bitter sense of humor. And as a Harrison Ford flick, it's a bit of a thrill to see him pick back up with the CIA to hunt down the bastards who wronged his family. Plus, there are a couple instances of the dread Ford Angry Finger Point of Doom (thank you for that, Internet). And then at the end, there's that syrupy baby stuff and a contrived smash-cut to credits. Still have a bad taste from that one.6/10 "},{"Title":"Such a great 90s film...","Date":"6 June 2013","Score":"","Genre":"Action, Thriller","Review":" PATRIOT GAMESWhat a great thriller...I remember this getting released back in the 90s... and I was never really interested. I can't remember why because this is a great movie.The movie is about an ex CIA agent who foils an assassination attempt on a member of the royal family. Because one of the terrorists got killed during the attempt, the IRA want revenge on him. They travel to the USA and try to kill him and his family.The story is brilliant. Great action and on the edge of your seat thrills. It has got some good twists that I never saw coming and the movie runs very smoothly. I didn't get bored at all and really enjoyed this from beginning to end.This has got a host of stars. Harrison Ford takes the lead and he plays it brilliantly. I like Harrison in a lot of movies, especially thrillers. My favourite thriller of his is What Lies Beneath. Patriot Games also stars Anne Archer, Patrick Bergin, Sean Bean, Thora Birch, Samuel L. Jackson & James Earl Jones. I think all of these actors are great. I also think this is the youngest I have seen Thora in a movie. I would say the only thing I wasn't very keen on was her character. The way she reacted just seemed very unrealistic to me. People were getting shot and attacked all around this little girl and she stayed calm and even smiled at one point. I am pretty sure any other little girl would be scared, crying or freaking out.The movie has a great 90s feel to it. I always think that the 90s released a lot of great thrillers. In fact most of my favourite thrillers are from the 90s. The Juror & Sleeping with the Enemy are 2 that stick out in my mind that were exceptionally brilliant.I will give this 7 out of 10.A great thriller with a great cast list...

Alas, in following the masterstroke that was The Hunt for Red October, it isn't quite up to the task of providing us with a deft; subtle espionage thriller which keeps us on the edge of our seat's and has its runtime fly by. So gnawing, in fact, is the feeling in Patriot Games that it merely strikes us as a project constantly aware of it's bigger brother that it ends up being a project that's a little too eager to impress and unsure of how to spend all its evident energy. A measure of how inferior Phillip Noyce's effort is lies in a scene nearer the end, a scene set in the African desert where an ally of the Irish enemies, who worked undercover for them in London, finally meets up with them following a failure in his operations. Witness the way in which the Irish terrorists eliminate him now that he's outlived his usefulness; witness the obligatory air of generic familiarity about proceedings in this scene, as if we knew what was coming. Now recall how McTiernan's October ran its course without any such instance.Things have been bulked out in Patriot Games, as if the border-line lone, enclosed locale of the nuclear submarine from before has been identified as an issue and swept aside for somewhat of a globe-trotting escapade that hops from Ireland to Libya bay way of London and Virginia. Gone too is the Scotsman doing Russian, replaced by the Englishman doing Irish &#x96; he is Sean Bean and he plays the innocuously named Sean Miller, a member of an I.R.A. rebel cell whose attempts to kill an affluent friend of the British Royal family fails when a certain somebody intervenes thus saving the day although causing the death of Miller's younger brother.The certain somebody is Harrison Ford's Jack Ryan, a man in London on business with his wife and infant daughter charged with hosting some lectures for the C.I.A. when the chaos kicks off and he eliminates Miller's much adorned younger sibling. In spite of Miller's capture, he swears a revenge on Ryan's own family &#x96; a family with whom it's already established Ryan has a wonderful rapport; right down to the somewhat romanticised exchange of love between he and his wife set to champagne and candles whilst occupying an exquisite London hotel. Needless to say, Miller does eventually break free of his judicial shackles &#x96; his desire to wipe the Ryan family out in an act of revenge is not agreed upon by the rest of the faction but he harbours his grudge anyway. In spite of this, American authorities don't believe he'll come after Ryan.... so naturally, he does and terrorism crash lands on the streets of the United States at a time when, cinematically, this sort of content would have been much more affecting.What is pleasing, however, is that while this is the American thriller whereby the hero actually bleeds when he is caught in combat and needs to spend time in a hospital recovering, the film resists the urge to depict what is essentially a movie-going revenge fantasy. Ryan is both injured and shaken; his family are a target and a threat is at large out there in the wider world. There is a sense of helplessness, of vulnerability &#x96; we do not sense that we're anywhere near the likes of 1985's Commando. In spite of its positive core values, it would be impossible for me to say that the film gripped me as much as The Hunt for Red October did, but equally difficult to say that the film was not gripping at all. The film is much more conventional, and it works as your more standardised thriller, but then this might be out of the fact the series' previous entry was of such a high calibre. The heroes and villains are cleaner cut in this edition. Ryan, the charismatic professional and family man to boot, is up against the rough and ready thug who was out to do some serious damage even before they become preoccupied with ruining Ryan's life. One's fondness for Connery's character in the last film not as a villain, but as a complicated personality doing what he was doing on top of the depiction of Ryan essentially as a middle-man hopping between the Americans and the Russians, is sorely missed.And yet there is little room for one to recommend this as a piece of dumb, fluffy entertainment. Its director, Noyce, carves something out of the core ideas that's watchable and feels somehow superior to most in its genre. There is a desire to follow in the footsteps of the previous effort in trying to construct this broad canvas upon which every-which side is depicted in this global struggle against the terrorist threat, but it just doesn't come off like it did before. The success ranges from that of the moderately engaging depiction of police officers back in Britain striving to find domestic IRA members to just plain pointless, as a member of the Royal Family tries to work his schedule around potential terror attacks. While in desperate need of a final act re-write and disappointing in its boiling down to a one-on-one Thunderball-esque boat chase, its biggest crime remains its inferiority to Hunt. The film is not without a certain energy and we invest rather a lot into it, it just doesn't have the dynamism nor guile its predecessor had.

PATRIOT GAMES might not have quite the verve and excitement of its sequel, CLEAR AND PRESENT DANGER, but it still provides plenty of decent thrills along the way.Things get off to a great start with a fantastic opening set-piece (sadly, the rest of the film never quite equals this moment) which ably sets the plot in motion. What follows is fairly predictable, but nonetheless engaging, as Ford finds himself and his family on a hit list. Sean Bean is the chief bad guy, and not quite as effectively nasty as he would be later in his career; put it down to inexperience maybe.The rest of the film is populated by familiar face after familiar face. You get the then-new actors (Polly Walker, Samuel L. Jackson) and the reliable old-timers (James Earl Jones, James Fox), and they all run through their scenes efficiently and with gusto.The only reason I didn't enjoy this quite as much as I thought I would is that so much of it is now familiar from more recent movies, particularly the climactic scenes. It all feels very ordinary and expected, never quite taking it to the next level; watch the superior sequel for that.

Ryan helps to thwart Holmes' assailants and becomes a local hero. But Ryan's courageous act marks him as a target in the sights of the terrorist whose brother he killed. Now Ryan must return to action for the most vital assignment of his life to save his family......Oh yes, the film has flaws, the depiction of the Irish is as bad as 'Blown Away', everyone drinks Guiness, listens to Clannad and send Leprechauns as gifts, but this is Hollywood, so it can be forgiven.As for the rest of the movie, it's one of the most taut and intense thrillers of 1992, and furthermore, it's one of Fords last movies where his name guaranteed a hit (fugitive, CAPD, AFO after this), and it still proves he was a major draw.Why? Because Ryan is the Everyman, he's not superhuman, or an action hero, he's just a family man trying to protect his family.Bean is great as the villain, and this film bases it's main plot on family. Bean And Ford meet when Ford is trying to protect his, Ford kills his Brother, Bean goes after Fords, coming around in full circle.It's really well made, with some great support from a who's who of Hollywood. It's not as action packed as one would think, but it keeps you on the edge of your seat.And it has one of the best endings a film has.

In structure, it has nothing a man is forced into defeating terrorists to save his family. The man is Harrison Ford playing the same role he does often, the unwilling hero who must negotiate evil to protect his family and ultimately the world. Being that it's a Tom Clancy story, it involves a lot of helicopters.It's worth watching though for maybe a few subtleties. For one thing, the quicker exposition of the plight of the family and how it isn't really overplayed or over-dramatized. In theory, this film could almost be a little more realistic than the usual snazzy explosion-thriller. Also it has one of those slam-bang endings that is actually pretty exciting. Thus, it has just enough stuff in it to keep it interesting and watchable, though it's extremely forgettable and rather uninteresting.For me the only thing that ended up piqueing my interest is seeing Thora Birch being her usual sarcastic self at such a young age.

We have this bunch of Irish terrorists, one of whom has gone off his hinges because of the loss of a brother, going bananas in his obsession with killing and punishing Ford's character.  So, knowing this, what do we do.  Oh, I know.  Let's go to the most deserted, unprotected place.  Let's take along the political figure the crazies are after, and leave them unprotected.  It doesn't matter that the wife and daughter have nearly been killed.  Let's stick them out there in as much harm's way as possible.  There is a lot to recommend this movie as far as atmosphere and a presentation of the zealots that create the situation. But, what do you know, Hollywood has to once again make them superhuman, virtually impenetrable, with the tenacity of the shark in Jaws.  This could have been a finely crafted thriller.  The situation is set up wonderfully. The terror is there.  Isn't it enough to be looking over the shoulder at every move.

However, something felt lost in the transition. Obviously Paramount thought Ford would draw a larger box office, and Ford does have more screen presence than Baldwin.  However, while Jack Ryan was a little naive, eager, intelligent and sarcastic in Hunt for Red October, Ford just seems to be monotonously brooding throughout most of Patriot Games.Granted, Clancy's book needed some major rework before transitioning to film.  Donald Stewart adapted the novel wonderfully until the last 5 minutes.  Perhaps my expectations were a little too high, but a fist fight on a power boat in the middle of Chesapeake Bay is a little hackneyed.Overall, the film is still good, definitely outranking the calibre of traditional Hollywood explosion-thons.

This is perhaps not really a movie based on a book of his, rather more of a Ford one loosely based on an original piece of writing. That doesn't have to be a negative aspect. It's put together just fine. The plot is emotional and straightforward, especially(although not only) compared to The Hunt for Red October. The pacing is reasonable, it's not downright boring. The dialog is plain and unmemorable, if not poor. The acting is sufficient. The characters aren't particularly layered, and one or two could be cut with seemingly no impact on the overall thing. Has Sam Jackson ever seemed so insignificant, before or since? This tries harder to appeal to the masses, mainly by implying sex and being crass. The violence isn't that strong. The language, however, is harsher and in greater amount than its predecessor, with no justification. The action is relatively plentiful(albeit not enough for this to go entirely work as that, nor can it be called an all-out political thriller... they should have picked a direction and stuck with it, in my opinion) in this, and it's well-done and entertaining.

And his speech, so rough and blue collar sounding, what a change from his earlier films, where he sounded so articulate despite his lower class roles. Ann Archer, who plays his wife, is even more pathetic as an eye surgeon (which she portrays most unconvincingly, the average viewer would have a hard time seeing her as even a nurse), reprising her role in Fatal Attraction as the victimized housewife, she even says Get them Jack, do whatever it takes. I was laughing uncontrollably at that one. Thora Birch plays the bratty little daughter, almost a duplicate of Ford's daughter in Regarding Henry (In many ways, this silly film resembles that one). James Earl Jones plays the annoyingly bureucratic CIA chief, and JE Freeman plays his incompetent flunky.The european cast is indeed much more lively and serious, but even they can't help this excessively long film. Richard Harris, Sean Bean, Patrick Bergin, and Polly Walker are fine actors, but their Irish accents are so phony sounding that the viewer has to wonder whats wrong with these people (especially since Harris was born in Ireland, and Bergin is Irish himself!!!!!!) The climax of farcicality is the SAS assassination raid on the Irish Terrorist camp in north africa, with the CIA watching through a satellite camera link!!!!!! (what dellusional story writer thought that one up???? If it was Clancy, he should be flogged) All in all, this film was a major disappointment for many, but with the cast and story, it wasn't hard to predict this disaster.

Probably for the wrong reason. Basically it is a modern Western. Good guy can't stand bad guys doing bad things and steps in to put things right. He has a family to protect and the family is threatened. This gives him extra inspiration for his violent defensive actions. Nothing entirely new under the sun.It is mainly the family aspect that makes me gape at Patriot Games again and again. Or more exactly It's the house the family lives in. I have seldom seen a place that looks more uncomfortable, inside but particularly from the exterior. I am not sure if this was intentional but somehow it reflects the awkward, painfully strained TV-commercial domesticity of the Ryan family perfectly. Like the house, Mr Ryan unnecessarily and inelegantly exposes himself to the extended forces of nature which, in his case, come in the form of mad terrorists. No sign of daily domestic routine can be spotted anywhere in that house. One of the most grotesque scenes shows mother and little daughter both deeply wrapped in coats and shawls sitting on a swing never meant to swing people on a porch never meant for a sojourn longer than two minutes. They are strangely lost folks, the Ryans and I just wonder what that is supposed to mean (probably nothing at all, but once a film is let loose the fantasy of the viewer runs wild). As the lack of warmth is evident in this beautifully filmed movie (even the final fire on the boat seems to be greenish rather than red), I soon started to wonder if the Ryan's place was built explicitly for Patriot Games or if real people normally live in that place. Well, I certainly wouldn't envy them.

Good suspenseful action sequences always entertain, though the climatic boat chase isn't as impressive as it should be because it was filmed at night. Sean Bean is convincing and suprisingly sympathetic as IRA freedom fighter Sean Miller who lets his yearnings for revenge lead him astray from his cause. The talented James Earl Jones and Richard Harris are woefully underutilized though that's understandable considering this film is primarily a confrontation between Ford's Ryan and Bean's Miller. Solid if unspectacular, 7/10.

Aside from The Devil's Own (1997), the commercial American movies during almost the whole 1990s used to present the IRA men as the same unmerciful, nearly crazy, assassins. They love to blow up everything and everyone. And their best are the ones whom went to America and stayed there as peaceful citizens ! Although in Blown Away (1994) they showed the Irish man as that maniac who is rejected by the PIRA itself, finding a warrant for him to be evil with the lead, and turning the whole matter into just another revenge story of another brilliant bomber. BUT, still you've got to ask yourself why relating him to the PIRA in the first place ?! It's not why the Irish is always baddie ? It's rather why the Irish baddie must be a PIRA ?!!It leads us to the question  what's the hidden intention ? Though, sometimes there is no intention but to entertain, yet with different evil every time. Sometimes there is not enough acquaintance with the character (or its case). And sometimes there is a deliberate intention which uses cinema to display a certain negative point of view.So, according to Hollywood's many similar experiences towards many nations, would we go mad over this ignorance ?, this one-dimensional viewpoints ?, or just shut down our brain and enjoy the show ? Actually whatever the show is, we must define the shown point of view whatsoever, our opinion towards it, then enjoy the show.. if it deserves the enjoyment after! However, when you find that a lot of movies say the same thing all over, then it might be a public point of view, a common fear, a big misunderstanding, or a big companies' faith !(Patriot Games) is one of the big companies' productions. It's a thriller, action, and a piece of pure propaganda. The American lead is just the American hero; who's impeccable and super. The Irish man is surely the adversary; who's nerves mad killer. Just ask yourself what is the need to watch the capturing of the rest of the terrorists in the undeclared land of Libya as shadows in a small screen ?? It wasn't a hot action sequence as it could've been, or artistic take on that ! It is here only to show, or show off, the abilities of the CIA (that makes the movie an ultimate patriot game !). Actually I couldn't catch on the reason of the lead's so-called pain while that very scene ? Is he that idealistic who refuses violence in the world ? Or is it just his way of showing how he's excited out of the event and the high-tech that led to it ??! Anyway, apart from the fact that the next Jack Ryan movie (Clear and Present Danger) will take the thrill to a next level, being a smarter and deeper movie, it will be anti-propaganda as well; where the enemy is originally in, not out.(Phillip Noyce) is a fine director. He made a good time out of usual story. I'm not a fan of (Ford), but I love a line was said about him from one reviewer once when you need an action hero that can act, then call him. He adds a lovely truthful humanity to the character of the ideal American, which's always something rare to be found in his enemies ! (Sean Bean), acting as one of the Ulster Liberation Army (a Maoist breakaway offshoot of the PIRA), represented not the worst of what a PIRA man could be, but the worst of any man ! You can repulse that in every human kindred there are good and bad people. But simply the empty repetition of these clich√©s and stereotypes was ruining the Northern Ireland's case, soiling the long struggle for liberation, and stereotypes the Irish as only a terrorist ! Though, it's Hollywood ladies and gentlemen. Namely the cartoon thinking of bad guy/good guy. And they easily make their choice in that matter.

Tons of them, exactly, and if it wasn't for Harrison Ford you'd taken it for another stupid Steven Segal-movie! The whole script (based on Tom Clancy's book) is based on facts that are hard to believe (most hilarious is that Ford discover a woman one one of the many trainingcamps in North Africa because he see...sit down...tits taken on a satelittephoto!!!!). The story is very simple even if the movie is one big (useless) plot.

Not really, the acting is fine....Ford in his usual style, Sean Bean playing a perfect role from maniac and Samuel L. Jackson.

It goes without saying that it's another one of these films they insist on making 30 minutes too long.The only good things in the film were the redoubtable Richard Harris, his cameo as the hardened veteran Republican spokesman, however repelling, was superb and right on the money despite the best efforts of an awful script, and the Clannad parts of the soundtrack were really good particularly  when twinned in the Irish nightime killing scene.A few nice touches, but on the whole give this one a body swerve.

I assume they paid more attention to creating a thrilling movie that they forgot to pay attention to the script.This movie fails on all levels.  The two biggest errors was explaining what certain people were doing things and tying up loose ends.(Spoilers?)There's a scene in the used books store where we learn someone's been spying on the bookeeper.  I kept asking WHY???  Suddenly surprises me why are they there?  It never explains this.  And once this scene ends... we never see these strange spys again.  What happened to them?And then it builds up the two irish folks (not the true bad guy) up so they seem rather smart.  Why would they infuriate an obviously insane man? During the raid in Africa it never truely explained why they were there.  It never let us know how they seem to be fast flyers and in the end I can't believe I wasted $15 on this dvd.

I am not a Clancy fan, and I am not a Harrison Ford fan. However, I expected a better entertainment from this picture. After all, Clancy had some other books adapted to the big screen with decent results, and Ford played in 'Frenzy' by the time this film was made. What we get is a broken pace thriller, full of stereotypes, with no sex-appeal or gadgets to balance the platitude of the characters and the banality of the action. The bad guys are that bad, that even when one of the Irish IRA fund-raiser tries to be good, he actually does it by betraying his fellows. Harrison Ford's act is that wooden-like that he seems to have suffered of stomach problems while the whole movie was shot. The setting is professional, but simply un-interesting.Getting a 6/10 only thanks to some supporting good acting.

Han Solo just can't cut it here. His over the top anger, his blank it's not my fault! emotion and even his raised finger to Richard Harris aren't enough to make him watchable or acceptable as Jack Ryan. Also Anne Archer comes off as a pompous snob. Thora Birch is cute as the daughter. The only good actors who do well here are James Earl Jones, and Alan Armstrong, and it was nice to see Shameless's Frank Gallagher (David Threfall). I don't know if Alec Baldwin and Gates McFadden would have been better, but I suspect so. Ford and Archer were purely names to help sell a film franchise. Sean Bean once again reprises his lunatic killer role and the film's plot makes about as much sense as his character does. Miller takes care of his compatriots just to take a shot at a fleeing Jack Ryan. A very poorly executed film that had a lot of potential and a ready following from the books. The action is watchable, and the satellite assassination was cool, but that's all you will get from this film, aside from a sore butt from watching the overly long ending.
