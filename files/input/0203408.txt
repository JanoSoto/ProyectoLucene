Most people either love it or hate it.  There is little in between.  I fall into the group that loved it.  Yes, it's true, Casper Van Dien is a little inconsistent.  When he's good, he is very good, but sometimes he is less than adequate. (He is more often good.)  Catherine Oxenberg is believable in a fairly standard role.  Michael Ironside gives a very nice performance in a difficult role; difficult because his role, Dominic, was not well conceived, but he overcomes this problem beautifully. The casting of Michael York was inspired.  His excellent performance as Stone Alexander is very suave, very powerful, very weird.  I must also mention Jan Tr√≠ska and Gregory Wagrowski as the prophets.  Their performances are very subtle and most convincing. Overall, well written, the script and story were well executed.  I did have a problem with a couple of unnecessary scenes.  There were several lines of dialog that were not believably written, but for the most part the script was sound.  One piece of advice - go see this movie with an open mind. This isn't a perfect movie, and if you accept that, you should enjoy it immensely.

It's clearly a ham handed attempt to ram an apocalyptic televangelist philosophy down your throat. And you would expect nothing else when you learn it is produced by Matthew Crouch, son of Paul Crouch who is one of the countries leading televangelists and founder of TBN. The  plot is lifted directly from the popular Bible Code series of books by Michael Drosnin, although it is dumbed down substantially for the film.Unfortunately, this film lacks the wacky charm and unintentional humor of the Crouch's TBN TV productions such as Praise the Lord.I never expected much from soap actors like Casper Van Dien and Catherine Oxenberg but it is truly sad to see how far Michael York and Michael Ironside have fallen, that they need to appear in mediocre movies such as this.

It is not great, but if you allow yourself to ignore the Christian Right agenda, it is a rather entertaining tale. Films have a long tradition of exploiting biblical phenomena, and people have been entertained by such stories for years. The Exorcist, The Omen, and Raiders of the Lost Ark come to mind. Even the use of a crucifix to scare off vampires is well established. I think too many people are hung up by the fact that this film was intended to support a specific agenda -- the Fundamentalist interpretation of biblical prophesy. Casper Van Dien shows occasional glimpses of knowing how to act -- a refreshing change from his previous efforts. The rest of the cast does a decent job for this type of film. Taken as a high tech suspense-thriller it is quite a fascinating yarn. To me, those who rate this movie below 4 or above 8 are simply not being objective. It probably should be an average of 6.

I am a Christian and I have always thought that if a real Hollywood type movie could be made about the end times, then it would be very entertaining and very frightening, even if you don't believe the Bible. I still have that belief, but this definitely wasn't the movie that will entertain and frighten people, on the contrary it will make people confused and probably laugh a lot. I know it wasn't a Hollywood movie, but it did cost about 7 million dollars to make, and that is low budget, but I have seen movies that cost less, and were much better. This one had sub par acting, a horrible musical score that sounded like it was done entirely on a keyboard, and a script that seemed like it was done by people who have had little experience with screen writing. It was extremely confusing to me, and I have some knowledge of Revelation and Daniel, so I can imagine how confusing it would be to someone who has little or no experience with those books at all. Obviously too much of the budget was spent on the effects (and they weren't that great), and not on getting good screen writers and good actors. Overall, very disappointing.

I expected to see explosive, earth shattering depictions of the tragedies that the bible describes in the rise and fall of the anti-christ.  Instead the majority of what we see is the inner turmoil surrounding Casper Van Dien's character, and not the turmoil the entire world is supposedly going through. I feel the production team did not adequately convey the chaos and tragedies that were supposedly enveloping the entire world. If that was more clearly depicted the audience would have attained the feelings of horror at the events unfolding, which was necessary to the audiences' rallying of support against the anti-christ, and his exploits, and the support of Van Dien's character.

Carpenter's stuff, Barker's stuff always find an audience. And this movie is about as good as they are, which is to say a 2 on a scale of ten.What makes this film truly remarkable is that it was made not as a mere opportunity to skim money from the trailer park crowd. Instead, this film is deeply self-referential The filmmakers themselves are engaged in a battle with the devil and the film is a salvo in that war, the same war depicted in the film.Part of the shock is that virtually no film today takes itself seriously in every respect, and on that basis alone this film demands that we apply a more rigorous scale. Just on that, this film needs to be slapped hard -- being just ordinarily bad is amplified when you claim the work comes from God.But add to that the difficulty of the `truth' that the film relies on. It relies on a notion of fate, and on a use of the Bible which is radically unbiblical, instead subconsiously invented to attract and bind committed members. This specific notion of apocalypse has predicted the end of times within a generation for the last 120 generations!And on top of that, some numeric monkey business with the text of scripture is employed, which is fine enough for fiction. But the film and the books behind it tie this to Kabbalah. I know something about Kabbalah and can report this is absolutely incorrect. Kabbalah is supposed to be the true word of God, a mystical oral tradition because what was  given to Moses could only be imperfectly and ambiguously translated into the written work. In other words, the secrets of Kabbalah are unbiblical by definition.If you wish to see an intelligent film based on study of Kabbalah, directed by a first class director, with more competent acting, check out `The Ninth Gate.' It takes some work in viewing. I live down the road from Pat Robertson's Christian film university/broadcasting center/law school. They have billions of dollars behind thousands of students that are working toward films such as `Code.' What happens when they produce stuff that is not so obviously vapid?

Hopefully Omega Code has lifted many eyebrows, and given Hollywood a wake up call that a movie can be good without being vulgar.I have seen a few reviews bashing this film, but the sites that list the negative reviews never reference the positive reviews like the ones from CNN, USA Today, The New York Times or Time. Why? Is it because they can not fathom that a quality film could be made on a $7.2 million budget from a young company? Is is because they could not handle the idea that maybe Bible prophesy could be true? Who knows.My son, a 13 yr old big fan of guts and gore, thought this was a good movie even without the graphic violence evident in many of today's films, and he is not an easy sell. It also made sense to his intellect & sparked a good discussion of prophesy and what the future holds for him, something teens rarely like to consider.Lastly the numbers can't be wrong. Grossing $7,745 per screen average the first week it opened, the highest of all the Top 10 movies that weekend, it has still managed to garner over $3,000 per screen average now 5 weeks after release. Most big movies average $2,000 per screen. If it was all that bad, the numbers would not have held up!If extreme violence, sex & potty mouth is your idea of entertainment, then you probably ought to skip this film; If you are looking for a exciting drama that will give you food for thought, Omega Code should be on your 'next to see' list.

Because of the significant advantages to be gained from its possession, evil forces want his work and send a hit man named Dominic (Michael Ironside) to kill him and acquire it. They succeed in killing him and they get most of the code. But not all. When the news of Rabbi Rostenberg's murder leaks out a popular motivational speaker named Gillen Lane (Casper Van Dien) is called upon by television reporter Cassandra Barashe (Catherine Oxenberg) to explain to her audience the importance of this Bible code. Not long afterward the man recently appointed as the Chairman of the European Union, Stone Alexander (Michael York) calls upon Gillen Lane to be his public relations spokesman as he launches an effort to consolidate the world under his leadership. Anyway, rather than disclose the entire plot and ruin the mystery for those who haven't seen this movie I will just say that while this film is entertaining the story itself is mishandled a bit. The main cause of this is the fact that it spends a great deal of time on setting up the story but condenses way too much material at the end. As a result the ending leaves much to be desired. Still, both Michael Ironside and Michael York, along with Catherine Oxenberg to a lesser degree, performed in a reasonably good manner and their performances make the film watchable. However, I cannot say the same for Casper Van Dien as he just didn't have the presence required to be a lead actor. In any case, this isn't a bad Christian film and I think it deserves an average rating.

But with a network at your command The Omega Code was promoted like only a Disney film would be. Paul Crouch and his wife Jan who looks like a Christian version of Mae West put their son Matthew in charge and he directed this film. I suspect that players like Casper Van Dien, Michael York, Catherine Oxenburg and Michael Ironside probably directed themselves. Each made very sure there presence was known often clashing with the others. No one was piloting this ship.And of all things scandal befell this Christian movie as Casper and Catherine found love while married to others. A dime store version of Richard Burton and Elizabeth Taylor. Not the kind of publicity you want with the fundamentalist audience you are trying to reach.Scandal did not hurt Casper Van Dien's career, but I suspect association with this product did with mainstream audiences. He had done so well playing Tarzan and with Starship Troopers. Here he plays a charismatic motivational speaker along the lines that Tom Cruise did in Magnolia. He gets a call from international media magnate Michael York to work for him as a kind of press spokesman. That arouses some jealousy in Michael Ironside who plays a Satanic hit-man. As for York he's getting the ultimate kind of help for the ultimate kind of ambition.Those who are fundamentalists will not be deterred from seeing The Omega Code.

However, I am also a movie buff, and I rate movies on their ability to entertain me rather than by some message that I am told that I should like.  Going into the movie, I was hoping that it would be enjoyable, but I hadn't already made up my mind that it would be, as I can see many of the reviewers on this page are.

Just because he started to believe in God at the end of the movie doesn't excuse the poor writing and lack of motivations.  Next, the plot is so far changed from the Book of Revelations that it is supposedly representing.  Then there is the idea of the Bible Code itself.  How can we take seriously a Code of predicting the future that only has stuff from the presant and future, but not of our past.  It is sloppy and irresponsible writing to think that just because a few hundred years ago is past to us it wouldn't be future to the people alive at the time of Jesus.Overall, I am glad that they are trying to get more Christian films made, but competent directing and writing and excellent acting (as Ironside and York potrayed) is the key to making an excellent film.  It doesn't matter if it doesn't have sex or swearing if the film is so mediocre that you would rather watch an average R rated film for a more entertaining time.Better luck next time, guys...

Just about every movie out was wildly inappropriate for her (horror movies and such).  Absolutely custom-made was David Lynch's The Straight Story, but agonizingly, it was only playing in Los Angeles county -- too far to drive.  Therefore, The Omega Code was basically our only choice.We should have stayed home and rented a video.  This was by far one of the worst movies I've ever seen.  I've never walked out of a movie in my life, but if I hadn't been there with my family, I *certainly* would have walked out of this one.Had I known this film was produced by the Trinity Broadcasting Network, I would have strongly resisted going.  Not that I'm anti-Christian (though I am generally anti-televangelist), but perhaps I can explain how bad this movie was by way of analogy.TBN's headquarters are in my home town of Costa Mesa.  They are... well, *painfully* visible off of the 405 freeway.  The theme of the building and grounds is some unholy, Frankensteinian hodge-podge of Roman, Greek, Biblical, and American Colonial architecture. Their photos on their website fail to show the ultra-tacky bright white Christmas-type light strings that line the building year-round, and the unaesthetically-scattered statues that dot the lawn, but you may understand what I mean when I say that The Omega Code is the cinematic equivalent of TBN's HQ.As of this writing, there are 123 comments on this movie already, so I don't need to go into great detail on what makes it so bad, but I'll cover a few highlights.  First off, the score may be the worst I've ever heard. Unimaginably schmaltzy.  A horrid example of a sample-playback-synthesizer-pretends-to-be-an-orchestra score.Now let me tackle suspension of disbelief.  Events and developments that would be astounding in real life, like the formation of a World Union, are nervously rushed through with as little fanfare and human reaction as possible, in some misguided attempt to force them down our throats and make us believe them.  They present things like the oceans turning to blood with matter-of-fact TV newscasts.  I thought the way these newscasts drained all the inherent wonder out of the subject material was a good metaphor for what the movie did as a whole to its subject matter.I could go on and on, but additionally I'll just say that the nuclear holocaust of holiness CGI from the end of the film was lifted straight from 1982's Star Trek II The Wrath Of Khan.  Also, I can't recall another movie I did as much groaning, sighing, head-shaking, and chuckling at inappropriate times on as this one.It would have been infinitely more interesting and satisfying to watch a film consisting of nothing but author Jeffrey Satinover sitting on a stool and reading from his book (on the same topic) Cracking The Bible Code for two hours.

I did manage to dislike a few things Van Dien was too young (but he was good in the role), Devon Odessa was simply horrible, and some of the camera tricks (the childhood flashes and night vision scenes) were annoying. Yet this movie was startlingly wonderful. I was shocked by how into this thing I was. The rest of the acting was good (especially Michael York and Michael Ironside), the story was compelling, and the effects were very good, especially considering that this movie's budget wasn't very large. When I saw public opinion, I was shocked again. Everyone seems to hate it. Some people complain about acting, direction, and similar things. Those are all right differences of opinions that everyone doesn't have to agree with. After all, I thought Three Kings was a vile hunk of trash, but I don't expect others to hate it. However, when I see people spouting out nonsense about inaccuracy, I lose my patience. The Bible has various interpretations, and no book has more of a variance than Revelations. This is because Revelations HASN'T HAPPENED YET. How can anyone say They did this event wrong when one doesn't know how the event is really going to take place? If you use that kind of thinking, how can you enjoy any futuristic science fiction movie? Well, 2001 A Space Odyssey is bad because it is inaccurate. Here it is 2001 and it hasn't happened yet. What a bad movie. That movie, like this one, is speculative fiction and shouldn't be expected to follow things to the letter. You don't have to believe it. I liked End of Days, Stigmata, and The Seventh Sign but I don't believe the world will see these events. I had a history professor that thought Braveheart was the worst movie ever made because of the historical blunders. It is a slightly valid claim, seeing as how we are dealing with history and past events. Still, that is no reason to trash Braveheart. And it didn't stop it from becoming Best Picture of the Year. The Omega Code should be treated no differently. Just because it has a Christian point of view is no reason to reach into thin air to pull out poor criticism and cynicism.

The story is basically about how a power hungry individual uses Biblical prophecies to gain power, a revived Roman Empire.  And in that vein, it's a pretty good movie.

But I was also excited, because as much as I tend to shy away from  things like the Bible code, I could see great potential for a movie plot.  And I was  thrilled to see what was billed as a Christian movie playing in mainstream theatres to mainstream audiences, and with mainstream appeal.Unfortunately, I my suspicious side was more right than my excited side.The problems began with the story.  Written by two people with no previous cinematic experience, the tale jumps and skitters through a transitionless rendering of a possible interpretation of the Apocalypse of St. John.  Character develop (the few characters who are developed) with no motivation, no context, no grounding for the changes which they undergo.  Events take place with no internal support; audience members must draw from their outside knowledge and experience to understand what's going on and who's who.  But those in the audience who do have such an understanding are going to have other problems at times the movie draws more from the Book of Daniel than from Revelation, and many of the elements from Daniel which make it into the film are thought by most scholars not to reference the end-times but to reference other things, such as the destruction of the temple and the conquest of Jerusalem. Those Christians in the audience who believe in a pre-tribulation rapture will be disappointed that the rapture does not feature at all in the film.  Those Christians who believe in a post-tribulation rapture will still be disappointed, because there is no tribulation -- apart from struggling fishermen in Japan and a broken-down manufacturing plant somewhere in the world, life goes on as normal.And the goal which is proclaimed on many of the posters of the movie -- to open audiences up to the Gospel -- can only be achieved if the Gospel is actually referenced, apart from allusions to Christ.This is not to say that the story is the only problem with the movie.  The movie (which may be film, but is certainly shot, staged, and lighted as if it were a video) is directed by an inexperienced director who told most of the performers to use exaggerated stage mannerisms, as if subtlety were impossible on the big screen.  The sound and score are laughable -- over-miked, synthesized, predictable.  Most of the acting is largely mediocre.  The casting was questionable.  The editing is sloppy.  The special effects (by the folks who brought Godzilla to life) look as if they were airbrushed and applied with Q-tips.The idea of the movie had potential, and I look forward to future attempts by Christians to put legitimate work in theatres, but the folks who put this movie together needed to either consult with people who had more previous experience than they did, or else to first watch a couple of movie and see how they should turn out.

What happened was that I was visiting my mother and step-father during the Thanksgiving holiday a few years ago and we decided to go to the multiplex without having any particular movie in mind.When we got there, a debate ensued over which film to see. I didn't want to sit through whatever Meg Ryan romantic comedy was playing and Mom vetoed anything potentially violent. So I suggested that we break the impasse by seeing The Omega Code, a film that none of us had seen advertised or knew anything about. I figured that as a result of being adventurous, we might be pleasantly surprised by an offbeat box office sleeper.What a mistake. I sat cringing throughout the entire film, with the shameful knowledge that my open-minded, random pick had backfired on us so miserably. I spent literally hours after we left the theater apologizing for leading us so far astray.Another reviewer commented that Omega Code's premise of a numerological interpretation of the Bible is similar to that of Darren Aronofsky's Pi. While I felt that Pi was ultimately unsuccessful in its treatment and plot, it is at least a watchable investigation of the idea. Even my mother, who has purchased and read novels of the `Biblical fiction' genre, was unenthusiastic about this lackluster interpretation of the apocalypse.I remember the film Dogma, which covers similar Biblical subject matter was also playing at the same time. I wish we'd stumbled into that one instead. I'm not a huge fan of Kevin Smith's films, but I've since rented Dogma and it at least presents a coherent, if convoluted plot and some interesting characters in its comically warped take on Armageddon.There have already been over a hundred commentaries for this movie, but the reason I felt compelled to write this one is that I stumbled across the entry and found that the title of the first contributor's summary is a very positive  `Accurate Biblical Drama.' I couldn't disagree more.And I'm not some high-minded cinema buff either. I enjoy a well-paced thriller or moderately smart sci-fi movie once in while. But this doesn't work in any way on any level at all. Don't even rent this one for its supposed camp value as some commentators have recommended, its just plain inept in a tedious way that's not even interesting. I'm both baffled and horrified that it actually somehow spawned a sequel.

The post-weekend review of Omega was not unlike the pre-debut pans, ranting about violence and misinterpretations of the Biblical story, etc.  (Hard for me to believe, since the lame Noah thing with John Voight and Mary Steenburgen was embraced by the media even though it was sickeningly violent and so far from the original story as to be ridiculous.  I get mad every time I think about it.)Setting aside all the religion movie complaints, Michael York is the best reason to see Omega Code.  Though he was nervous about his involvement, what with some other actors not pulling their weight--and there were certainly one or two really lame graphics scenes--the man was awesome and makes me regret ever thinking ill of him for his sad Dilbert-boss goofiness in the Austin Powers body-humor flicks.For any thinking person in Hollywood, the Alexander Stone role is York's official transformation from a character actor to a lead who has proven that he can not only hold his own, but everybody else's own too.  His performance was that powerful.  Even people who wouldn't get all the Biblical nods or appreciate the conversion scene should see this movie just so they can witness the power that Michael York can plug into a role.  Did I say role?

Screen writers Stephan Blinn and Hollis Barton have fashioned an unusually intelligent, intellectual script that manages to educate and illuminate as it entertains the audience in grand style. Casper Van Dien is superb as usual, playing a man in search of the truth while another, essayed with brilliance by the wonderful Michael York, seeks to change history to his own advantage. The lovely and extremely talented Catherine Oxenberg is also great in a significant supporting role, as is veteran Michael Ironside, making a strong impression in a small part. The past, the present, and the future hang in the balance as a struggle between good and evil will ultimately decide the fate of humanity.

Not that it's all Van Dien's fault.  The script for his character was very weak.  The comments about the Bible and religion that Van Dien's character Dr. Lane makes to the studio audience during the talk show are lame.  I find it VERY hard to believe that an audience would react with cheers and support when told (by Dr. Lane) that there is no God and they should find a higher power within themselves.The only salvation (pun intended) this film has is the nice performance by Michael Ironside.

First of all, why a motivational speaker?  That part was just stupid.  I mean, why would a megalomaniac trying to control the world rely on a motivational speaker? Is Alexander Stone really that disorganized?  First he can't decide what he wants to do to control the world, so he looks to the Bible for ideas.  Many of these ideas, I might add, really have no reliability(For example, the part of the The houses of Ishmael and Isaac shall scream out in terror could have already happened.  It could have been have been the synagogues burned during Krystalnacht and the mosques could very well have been the mosques blown up in Baghdad or something.)  And Gillen Lane's family!  They had no part except to provide a family values platfrom and dab their eyes with water!  I might add that since Casper van Dien/Gillen Lane is only in his twenties(or that's the impression that I had)and has a ten year child, he had his child during high school. Yeah, there goes TBN's family values. Also, why did this film have to be so damn propaganda-like?  I'll repeat what an earlier reviewer said.  The Indiana Jones flicks use Christian mythology as a plot dvice and manipulate it well so that we are intoxicated. This film doesn't do that.  The beginnig starts off well, with Michael Ironsides playing a priest who murders a scholar off some sort and steals the dead guy's Omega Code.  Then when confronted by two men who he is obviously afraid of, the two prophets tell him Tell your master that we are here!. Dominic(Ironsides) replies He already knows  and points to a small surveillance camera.  That part sent chills up my spine.  Had only it gone on like that one scene I would have loved this film.  I'll give Michael York credit he does a fine job of acting out his character, as does Michael Ironsides.  But the good guys are horrible.  I've already went on about Lane's family.  Now that I'm over the acting, I'll get on to plot.  This is obviously a Baptist film, since our beloved Pope of the Vatican is portrayed as an oaf.  The world domination plot I liked and found plausible and subtle, as were the action sequences were also thrilling and well-done.  Also another diatribe against the Vatican, their leaders are seen as dogmatically minded, since Gillen explains to the Pope that it's not the end of the world, but the beginning of a new one Also, the Vatican (or Israelis)says their going to secede from the World Union aince they used the Omega Code to control the world.  Whoever it was, they wouldn't just secede, they'd send over commandoes and kill them.  This is the equivalent of America knowing about the KGB going to kill the President and simply saying We're not going to talk to you any more!. Come on!

I do, however believe everything inside the Bible).  So I'm sitting on the edge of my seat enjoying the previews, when the movie comes on and manages to destroy my mood in a matter of minutes.  I had to bite my lip to stop from commenting on the terrible writing and acting while I was in the theater (I would have been torn to pieces by the people cheering at the rather clumsy but basically uplifting scenes and gasping at the insanely obvious and predictable Tension Scenes, I'm sure).  Once the final credits began to roll, however, I could reflect.  There were many parts of the movie I liked -- some mostly unexpected plot twists, some effects that were indeed special (I'm not counting the Visions.  Those were poorly done), and some interesting technical work -- fades, sets, that type of thing.  Unfortunately, I got the distinct impression that if I read the book of Revelation to a monkey and set the monkey in front of a typewriter for an hour, I could've gotten a better script.  And the music was beyond cheesy (even for a Bond fan who likes kinda cheesy music in scenes of action and intrigue).  So I wish I could be like everyone else in the theater -- like the people who came out crying and breathless because of how incredible it was -- but I'm not someone who can be appeased by a writer who throws some words over a Biblical shell and slaps a Christian stamp on it.  I need a good plot and believable dialogue before I can enjoy most movies, and this just didn't have either.  I'm sorry, but I wouldn't recommend this film to anyone.  And that's the tragedy.

Casper Van Dien by his discision to kill Michel York (who has already been resurrected from the dead) somehow stops the Second Coming of Christ by his act of belief in God.

The director is the one who decides how the actors use their talent & what the producers have to work with. Nowhere has this been more true than in this movie.I thought the ideas put forth were pretty good, and it really tried to make an effort to be philosophical, but it all got drowned in the direction of Robert Marcarelli. I have seen much better action films from around the same budget(El Mariachi for example). Even if the gore and sexual content got cut out, they would still be good because the directors knew what they were doing. Marcarelli never seemed to understand how people really look and act when they do stuff. The pauses were too long and when the people spoke, they sounded forced.It was a step in the right direction for people who don't like a lot of blood or sex in their films, but not a very big one.

Also, considering its low budget it had pretty good special effects. However, the thing that got most of my attention was the twist that I never saw coming.

Sadly, sketchy characters uttering embarrassing dialogue in a clich√©-riddled script with little overall action and an anemic ending make only a slight impression in this barely tolerable 100-minute, PG-13 rated melodrama.The Omega Code depicts the efforts of misguided philanthropic tycoon Stone Alexander (Michael York) who spends millions to usher in a new era of peace and prosperity with a little coercion and terrorism for good measure. You know Stone is up to no good when he talks about a one-world currency and an improved Roman Empire. First, he sends out his right-hand henchman, ex-priest Dominic (Michael Ironside of Starship Troopers), to gun down an elderly Jewish scholar after he had broken the 'Biblical Code.' Second, when our sartorial megalomaniac doesn't have his minions manipulating the Bible code to stage a global takeover, Alexander charms a motivational guru, Dr. Gillen Lane (Casper Van Dien of Tarzan and the Lost City), into serving as his mouthpiece. Dr. Lane drops everything to accommodate Alexander, forsaking his young daughter Maddie (Ayla Kell of Rebound) and estranged wife Jennifer (Devon Odessa of Shoot the Moon), before he realizes that Alexander has deluded both the world and him. Meantime, our straightforward but simple-minded hero suffers from hallucinatory visions, apocalyptic horses, hooded monks, and the tragic death of his mother. He refuses adamantly to believe in God. As far as Lane is concerned, no benevolent Higher Being could be so cruel and callous as to destroy his saintly mommy in a senseless car accident. In the middle of a conversation with TV talk-show host, Cassandra (Catherine Oxenberg), Lane experiences these terrifying visions, but he doesn't understand what they symbolize. Shrugging them off as uneasily as he does his botched marriage, he helps Stone embark on his quest for global domination until a jealous Dominic intervenes. When he tries to knock off Lane, Dominic accidentally shoots Alexander in the head and then frames Lane for the murder. Not only does Lane now know the scope of Stone's perfidy, but he also because a fugitive on the lam.Long Ride Home director Robert Marcarelli struggles against a formulaic B-movie script that makes any of The Omen sequels appear consecrated by comparison. The action unfolds quickly at first before it bogs down in numbing passages of exposition designed by its didactic scenarists to highlight the problems of modern society. The characters stand around and chew the scenery, but little happens that would make anybody's pulse race. Even the third-act Raiders of the Lost Ark pyrotechnics cannot salvage this heavy-handed religious propaganda potboiler. The filmmakers allow Michael York of Logan's Run little leeway in his villainous portrayal of Stone Alexander. He appears more urbane than intimidating. We are never in doubt from the outset that York's character is anybody but the anti-Christ. Check out Stone Alexander's star-shaped corporate logo that bears a suspicious resemblance to a pentagram. Indeed, York lends The Omega Code what modicum of dignity that it has with his polished performance. As the square-jawed, reborn hero who locks horns with Stone, Casper Von Dien acts like a school boy with a bladder control problem. Only career baddie Michael Ironside seems genuinely convincing as a hard-fisted fiend with no compunctions about homicide. The closest thing to profanity occurs when he utters 'son of a . . . 'then charges out of the room in pursuit of our hero before we can catch the b-word.The Omega Code draws its inspiration from bestselling authors, such as Michael Drosnin in The Bible Code, Grant Jeffrey in The Signature of God, and Jeffrey Satinover in Cracking the Bible Code, that argue you can find prophesies concealed in divine scripture by using equidistant Hebrew letter sequencing. Hasidic Jews argued the same nonsense as early as the 12th century so there is nothing new about this crackpot theory that is derived in part from Pythagoras who believed that numbers represented the ultimate reality.No, The Omega Code is not the greatest story ever told. The same people who complain regularly about sex and violence in movies should think twice about taking their children to see this shallow morality saga. Nevertheless, this TBN feature film contains several obligatory shoot-outs and a knuckle-bruising interrogation scene that earn it a PG-13 rating. Laudable as TBN's evangelical goals appear, The Omega Code amounts to little more than a second-rate imitation of a secular doomsday adventure opus. Altogether, this innocuously bland Providence Entertainment film release tastes like Tums for the soul.Stay home and read Revelation; it tops this muddled mystery thriller.

The plot was sort of interesting the hidden information in the bible about the future and the foretelling of events that lead to the end of the world.  I figured they would do a good job with Casper in the lead.Let me say this up front I have a lot of problems believing in Casper's acting abilities.  He is a very small man in size and when a lead actor is small (Alan Ladd was small in stature) they always surround them with short actors.  In this case Casper was surrounded with Michael York and Catherine Oxenberg (remember her from Dynasty?).  I actually saw Casper in person one time and was totally shocked at what a little tiny guy he is.  Very well portioned, even somewhat muscular, nice face and he does photograph well on the big screen but he is not one of our more intelligent actors and often isn't too convincing. Knowing he is just a short little guy can crack me up at times when he is being Mr. Forceful or Mr. Lover on the screen. Honestly, I have nothing against short people but I do have a problem with short people who act like they are big people.  If I had never seen Casper in person his height would probably never be an issue with me.  If the guy was six feet he would truly be an amazing hunk.Ok.  So the plot is somewhat interesting and the effects are digital. Michael York is a religious freak and Casper plays one of those guys who make millions off of let me build your confidence seminars.  Much of the action takes place in Israel and there are lots of Hasidic Jewish guys with the braids and little skull caps.  I got up to feed the cats during a lull in the action and when I do stuff like that it means I've lost interest in the movie.  I came back and never did get back into the plot until near the end when York believes he is the new God and Casper finds the secret to the bible.  There are these two mysterious guys in the picture who save Casper's butt several times.  I think they are Angels of some kind but can't be sure.Anyway, I wouldn't rent this film again for the life of me and I don't recommend it to others.  No sex scenes, you don't see Casper without a shirt or naked (which would have raised by 4 rating to a 5).

Robert Macarelli was uniformly bad in direction of the actors, the camera work, and the use of cheesy special effects.  The film had the look and feel of a bad TV production.But Macarelli's paucity of talent in direction was greatly exceeded by the abysmal acting.  No number of acting lessons will ever help Casper Van Dien.  He was so plastic and forced in his presentation that I retched at almost every line.

As it turns out, God being all knowing and all seeing, saw to it that these codes could only be unraveled by computer.Before the opening credits have finished rolling, there's this guy named Rostenburg (Yehuda Efroni) sitting at his computer where he has just finished deciphering The Omega Code. Just before being eliminated by a bullet hole to the chest, he rips part of the code out of his book and hides it in his shirt pocket. The guy doing the killing turns out to be Dominic (Michael Ironside), who is prancing about in the most ridiculous Rabbi disguise straight out of the Halloween Costume Department of Wal-mart.After stealing the CD Rom which contains the computer program that unlocks the code, and not for one minute thinking to search the corpse, Dominic begins his escape where he is quickly confronted by two strange characters, who after showing Dominic that his pistol is no match for their angelic prowess, tell him to be on his way like a good little boy so he can kill a few more rabbis or priests or whoever crosses his path the wrong way.Later on we will find out that Dominic is employed by a guy named Stone Alexander (Michael York) whose goal it is to rule the world by making sure the biblical prophecies are fulfilled. The best part of this opening sequence is that it let's us know early on that nothing in this film is going to involve logic, but at least the opening credits were finally over.We quickly zoom back to the good old U.S.A. where we meet Tony Robbins wannabe Gillen Lane (Van Dien) just as he is about to appear on an Oprah TV like show hosted by Cassandra Barashe (Catherine Oxenberg). She doesn't seem too enamored of Lane as he comes bouncing out like Dr. Phil on steroids and immediately gets the audience applauding and laughing along with his antics as he preaches to them how they can release their own empowerment. The funniest thing about this whole sequence is that the audience looks as if they were paraded over from TBN's Praise the Lord show and their laughter sounded like it was stolen from an old I Love Lucy episode canned laugh track.Shortly thereafter we meet Gillen's wife, Jennifer (Devon Odessa) who is not at all amused by his globe trotting, book selling antics. Jennifer has two personalities, glum and glummer. There's also his daughter Maddie (Ayla Kell), who simply loves her papa regardless of what her dour mother thinks. Later, Gillen once again runs into the Oprah host Cassandra, who has mysteriously quit her television show to become a globe trotting reporter completely in awe of Stone. Stone, with Gillen's help starts shaping world events so that the prophecies of The Omega Code can fall into place, which in turn will make Stone more powerful than a locomotive, faster than a speeding bullet, and holier than Jesus Christ himself.All of the events in The Omega Code take place over a period of about seven years, but the way this film is edited it could easily have been two days or two hundred years. We are never given any logical sense of time and place. Often, when Gillen is running from Stone's men or the police, he escapes but we are never shown exactly how. And he does a lot of running. At least a fourth of this film's running time is taken up with shots of Gillen running up the street or down the street or onto another street, running out of an alley or into a tunnel.In another sequence he returns home and at first his wife Jennifer won't talk to him. Then she holds up a sign saying the house is bugged and immediately they begin talking about their escape plan. In another goofy moment, Gillen is at the home of a friend who is secretly working for Stone. Coincidentally and right on cue, when the friend has to pop into the bathroom, the phone rings, Gillen picks it up and it just happens to be Stone once again which enables Gillen to escape.As for the rest of the cast, I have to admit I didn't mind Michael York's over the top portrayal of Stone. He made me fondly remember the lineup of villains on the old Batman TV series. As for Dien and Ironside, both of who took a right turn out of the bug hunting of Starship Troopers to appear in this mess, my suggestion is that they both re-enlist in the marines. Oxenberg does nothing more than appear as needed when the plot calls for it. Just about anybody could have phoned the part in . Too bad they couldn't get the real Oprah at least that would have been interesting, but you won't find Oprah within a thousand miles of this fiasco.If Crouch and Company were trying to win over some converts with this film, they probably failed. I'm sure it pleased those who are already sending in their nickels and dimes to the TBN conglomerate, but it certainly won't convince too many others. The plot is convoluted and totally incoherent. The dialog is stilted and goofy. The directing and editing wouldn't even pass the mustard on a network hour long television show.

From the start, Omega Code is obviously a religiously centered movie, and yet it seems to want so bad to be secular.  Slick camera shots, two big name leads, and the action flick format seem to scream Look at us!  We're making a secular film with Christian subject matter!  We've done the impossible!  But rather than intelligently weaving religious aspects into an already strong movie, the filmmakers seem to treat the mainstream and biblical elements of Omega Code like the hot and cold water in a broken gas station sink.  Sometimes it'll be hot, sometimes cold, but never properly mixed.  And in this case, neither are well executed separately either.  So we're left with a motion picture that spends half its time on mind-numbingly boring biblical diatribe and the other half on mind-numbingly boring hackneyed action scenes.  Don't get me wrong.  The Ten Commandments among other films has proven that the words of the Bible don't have to be boring.  But in this film, boring is all they can hope to be.

The Prophecy series was based on Biblical narrative as well, those movies are great.The Omega Code, however, is *not* in that league. First, the special effects were bad. I expect glaringly obvious CGI on TV, but not in film. Some, like the globe and the screens, were quite good. But I had a problem with them using an upright pentagram for Stone's logo. As a non-Christian, I found it very insulting. There are other symbols (like an inverted cross) which would have been better. Ok, ok, so technically an inverted cross is the cross of St. Peter, but that bit of trivia is not universally known.Secondly, while the actors themselves for the most part were quite good, the script was horrible and there was absolutely no chemistry between the characters. Speaking of the characters, they were also totally unbelievable. I'm sorry, Lane and his wife looked like they were both in their mid-20's. And they have an 8-or-9 year old daughter? And that wealthy too? Yeh, right.Next, everything *mysteriously* works itself out in the end.

There were many inconsistencies as well, for instance, why is it that when soldiers are running around at night, we (the audience) see things through night-vision goggles, but none of the soldiers are wearing them? Why is it that the Antichrist didn't ever know he was the Antichrist until half-way through the movie? Why is it that the characters make prophecy come true, when, if I'm remembering right, God does that, not humans? Why is it that seven years (the amount of time prophecy will take to be fulfilled, according to the Bible) seemed to pass in about five minutes? Why is it that the producers of this movie preached about how it didn't have any sex or bad language and would make a good family movie, but still thought it was okay to throw in some violence and receive a PG-13 rating? Unfortunately, although I do believe in the Bible and I wish that more quality biblical films were produced, I have to say that this movie is on my top-ten list as one of the absolute worst movies I have ever seen. I've never come so close to falling asleep in a movie theater.  I've never been so tempted to walk out of a movie because it was just so disgustingly pathetic. Maybe the producers should have used a different source of information for this movie, like the Bible.

Why would he want to be theAnti-Christ? Because he read about all the power and fame hewould have, of course, and also because he seems to be possessedby Satan. (Apparently, he neglected to read the REST ofRevelation, where the Anti-Christ is defeated and Jesus wins.You'd think this would make him NOT want to be the fulfillmentof prophecy.) Anyway, Casper Van Dien, acting so poorly and obnoxiously that Iwas hoping HE would be the devil figure, is the guy who forvague reasons has to stop the aforementioned Anti-Christ. The purpose of this film seems to be to encourage FundamentalistChristians to be even MORE paranoid about the last days, whichwe are certainly living in. The Anti-Christ is shown to be aregular, successful world leader who slowly gains domination,the implication that we should watch very carefully any suchpeople in real life. The thing is, we all know how it's going to end. There's GOINGto be an Anti-Christ, and he's GOING to gain much power, andhe's GOING to be defeated. It's all prophesied; it's gonnahappen. What good does it do to be all paranoid about WHO thatperson is? Don't follow people who are evil, and you'll be safe. This film looks, feels and sounds like a made-for-TV movie,especially in the lame dialogue department.

During the first 30 minutes I sat stunned in my seat, trying to decide if I should demand a refund. But since I hadn't paid to see it in the first place (passes), I figured I might as well stay.  And I didn't think it could possibly get any worse.It did. I will quickly run through the low points (includes some spoilers) The horrible miscasting of Casper Van Dien as Gillen Lane, a motivational speaker with two PhDs. The characterization was inconsistent; for example, Lane, despite his credentials, is a complete nitwit.  Then there's the lame-o depiction of the fulfillment of the Biblical prophecies; we see a bunch of sensational news soundbites accompanied by ridiculous computer print outs of the translated Biblical Code. Also, terrible action sequences Lane escapes from tough situations without explanation, and the one time Lane actually does seem to be in danger, it turns out to be a dream sequence! That's cute for grammar school writing assignments, but it's an inexcusable plot device in a motion picture. The pacing was bad after a long opener, the first third of the movie changes scenes every 90 seconds.  Later, the pacing improves, but there is still far too much unnecessary jumping around.  And as someone else mentioned, years pass yet no one (not even Lane's young daughter) ages.  That was disconcerting.There are a few good things, though. The quality of the film (e.g. lack of graininess) is high and very attractive.  The outdoor shots were well done and the location shooting added a touch of realism.  Also, there are a few moments in the last part of the film when Lane calls on God (finally) to help him - this proved to be quite exhilarating - even to me, someone who does not accept Jesus as a personal savior. But I liked this because it struck me as being the only genuine scene in the movie. Unfortunately, it was followed by major incomprehensibility.The characters, dialogue, direction and acting were ALL poorly done. Michael Ironside had nothing to do, and Michael York was just weird.  I think the producers wanted to do too much; if the plot had been tighter and more focused, and the characterization more fleshed out, the film would have been far better. In a nutshell, The Omega Code disappoints.  Definitely do not pay to see this.  I give it ** out of ten stars.

This movie is cartoonish vision from a paranoid outlook that is just barely disciplined by a slavish devotion to matching current events to the book of Revelation and the traditional trivia that's grown up around it.  The basis of the plot is an old myth that messages can be picked out of the bible by selecting individual letters based on a code.  It's been debunked by scholars who used the same methods to extract all sorts of idiotic messages out of the Bible.  But this alone shouldn't make the movie suck as bad as it does.The sloppiness of the Omega Code can sometimes be astounding.  For example, Catherine Oxenberg's character is clearly either an amalgamation of other minor characters or (more likely) is simply an all purpose character who stands in for any role where exposition is needed.  And man is there a lot of expository dialogue.The special effects are years behind their time.Casper Van Dien's aerobic delivery as a new age/agnostic/motivational speaker is comedy gold.  It's meant to parody secular charismatic types I think, but actually looks like an infomercial hosted by the biggest dork since Carrot Top.There's an insipid stretch in the center of the movie where Dien flees from the military and police forces of the whole world, and evades them by going to see his Dad, a Senator.The use of stock news footage is not only bad, but it is used so frequently that one can't help but suspect that they were padding the slim 100 minute running time.  Even though much of it is filmed on location, the direction indicates an almost feeble inability to suffuse the places with any grandeur. In the end, the plot just falls apart.  Actually, except for the fact that there are signs of the apocalypse and then a white light, the plot is a shapeless mass of stupid people babbling about things that make no difference to anything at all.  Really.  This plot is, and I don't say this lightly, as incoherent as Plan 9's.I did like how hurt Michael Ironsides sounded when he found out he wouldn't be antichrist Michael York's evangelist of evil.  The guy is a tight-lipped thug who can barely get along with the antichrist.  How dumb would he have to be to imagine that the antichrist would put him in charge of PR? Improbably dumb, even for this film.  But Ironsides invests his sense of betrayal with so much feeling, and the idea that he might have thought he was in line for a PR job is so unexpected, that it's a gut busting moment.I guess the funniest thing about this film is that it has so little to do with Christ - as in the guy who was in the Gospels and ransomed our souls and stuff.  Instead this movie obsesses on tearing Christian prophecy down to the level of conspiracy theory.  It's like watching the overarching theme of the X-Files, but without any interesting characters and lots of bloopers.
