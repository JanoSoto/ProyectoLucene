[{"Title":"A Perfect Film Comedy!","Date":"18 October 2003","Score":"58 out of 61 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy","Review":"  Have you ever watched a film and wished it wouldn't end? Where you loved all the characters, adored each scene, and laughed at every joke, even after you'd seen the film so many times that you could quote the dialog? MY FAVORITE YEAR is that kind of movie!Directed with gusto by Richard Benjamin, the film is both a loving tribute to Sid Caesar's 'Your Show of Show', and the remarkable talents that brought it together each week, and a sincere homage to Errol Flynn, whose antics and larger-than-life persona, in the waning years of his life, still had a kind of magic that could enthrall a shy young fan, or make a woman swoon.Three dynamic performances dominate the film. Mark Linn-Baker, as Benjy Stone, based on the young Mel Brooks, is a shy kid who hides his insecurities behind a rapid-fire wit. The dazzling young star in a staff of comedy 'pros', Stone suffers from an unrequited love from fellow staffer K. C. Downing (Jessica Harper), and has an inspiration, inviting legendary swashbuckler Alan Swann (Peter O'Toole) to appear on the show. As King Kaiser, star of the hit series, Joseph Bologna captures much of Sid Caesar's legendary physical 'presence' and irreverence to authority. When threatened by gangsters over a 'too close to home' series of parodies about crime boss Karl Rojeck (portrayed with brute menace by veteran actor Cameron Mitchell), Kaiser 'thumbs his nose' at them, mimicking the gangster mercilessly. I'll KEEP doing it! he taunts. Why? Because it's FUNNY!Then there is Peter O'Toole's 'Alan Swann'. With his own career a roller coaster ride of alcoholism, resulting in the near destruction of his health, no actor could have 'channeled' Errol Flynn better. Just as Flynn, by the 1950s, was a nearly burned-out rou√©, his classic good looks long gone, O'Toole's matinee-idol appearance, after years of self-abuse, had aged into a gaunt mask, making Benji Stone's film montage of 'classic' clips more poignant. What Flynn still had, in abundance, were charm and a ready wit, and O'Toole's 'Swann' is so enchanting a personality that you can't help but love him, and root for him to succeed.From the opening nostalgic strains of Nat King Cole's rendition of 'Stardust', through Benjy's futile effort to attempt to keep Swann sober (Red Skelton loved to tell how he kept Flynn sober on his program...he emptied all of the actor's bottles of vodka, replacing it with water...and Flynn couldn't tell the difference!), to a riotous Swann dinner with Benjy's family, to the near-disastrous broadcast, with Swann developing stage fright, and Kaiser brawling with mob enforcers...MY FAVORITE YEAR has one glorious scene after another, each unforgettable!One of the AFI's '100 Greatest Film Comedies', MY FAVORITE YEAR will bring a tear to your eye, even as you laugh. It was a time of legends, and heroes who would live up to boyhood dreams.Film comedy doesn't get any better than this!

Baker is also wonderful as the young comedy writer assigned to watch Swann's every move. There is great support from Bill Macy, excellent as the show's head writer; Green as the show's producer; Hoffman as a comedy writer who only whispers how he feels...only to speak at the end of the film and Kazan, who is simply divine as Baker's mother. The film is a fine slice of old fashioned comedy with great slapstick and dialogue with lots of zap and zing. Director Benjamin shines in his first venture behind the camera. O'Toole was Oscar nominated.

They might also have mentioned the scene in which a titanically intoxicated Alan Swann (O'Toole)essays to shimmy down the side of a building, using a fire hose as rapelling gear, or the farcically climactic fight scene on live 50's TV.But two other moments resonate even more strongly; they explain completely why Peter O'Toole was cast in this otherwise comedic role. In the first, O'Toole's character interrupts his own plans for an evening of debauchery to fulfill a fantasy by dancing with an aging, but still glorious Gloria Stuart.  Both onscreen and off, the audience is spellbound in the midst of the slapstick as these two senior-citizen actors seize the screen for the duration of their waltz.Even more compelling is an important scene later in the movie in which Swann makes a quick trip to visit a young daughter whom he hasn't seen in years.  He watches her from the car, but can't bring himself to get out and speak to her.  The scene is played completely without dialogue.  With the camera focused tightly on the warring emotions which play across O'Toole's face, no dialogue is necessary.  It's a powerful, lump-in-the-throat moment every divorced dad will recognize.I join others on this page in urging you to rent this movie for the laughs.  As you laugh, however, stay alert for two of the truest moments ever placed on film.  Enjoy.

It has the same zippy sitcom character of the set which is its main stage, and the comedic acting is often over the top. Yet it drives through some very subtle and deep ideas about what makes a celebrity tick, the price culture extracts from its most ballyhooed figures, and the scars divorce and drink can leave on those with the smoothest of surfaces.The secret to this film's success is O'Toole, who gives up some of his most intimate and affecting moments on screen and intersperses them with ass-over-elbow feats of physical schtick that would make a Ritz Brother proud. What a shock we never saw much else from him after this tour de force. Richard Benjamin did go on to direct other films like Shoot The Moon, but he never managed to get it all absolutely right the way he did here. It's so note-perfect, from the opening shot of midtown Manhattan 1954 with the cars, outfits, and bustle all coming together beneath the strains of Les Paul and Mary Ford's How High The Moon into a tight closeup of Benjy Stone carrying a cardboard cutout of his hero, Alan Swann, through an uncaring, jostling crowd.I almost wish they could have made a sitcom featuring the King Kaiser crew, with of course Joseph Balogna, Bill Macy, Adolph Green and the rest all reprising their roles in a kind of Remember WENN-style show. O, what roads left untravelled. Balogna is so good, managing to carry off his Sid Caesar-inspired role with the same kind of aplomb that made the original Caesar early television's most dynamic and celebrated comedy performer. There's a nice scene early on where Stone sticks up for a prone Swann by telling Kaiser he can't fire the swashbuckler. You're a big star now, and I'm sure you always will be, Benjy says. But suppose, and I know it will never happen, you end up like this. I hope nobody does to you what you're doing to him. Of course Caesar did end up like this, strung out on substance-use problems that derailed his post-50s career, and knowing that gives the scene, both funny and tension-filled, a certain undertone of poignancy for those in the know.Mark Linn-Baker could have taken it down a notch or two, and the Brooklyn idyll was to die for, and not in a good way. I'd like to know how the hell I'm supposed to lock lips with the woman of my dreams by stuffing my face with Chinese food and showing her old movies, but I don't think my repeated viewings have helped my love life much. It has given me many hours of pleasure though. This is one film that keeps on giving. With lines like Plastered?

This laugh-filled comic romp follows the adventures of Benji (Mark Linn-Baker), a gopher for COMEDY CALVACADE (this film's version of YOUR SHOW OF SHOWS), who is excited when a swashbuckling actor of the period named Alan Swann (Peter O'Toole) has been booked as a guest on the show turns out to be a skirt-chasing alcoholic who Benji is put in charge of keeping under control until showtime. This movie is a lovely valentine to the 1950's with exquisite period detail and an intelligent screenplay that invokes the period so beautifully. O'Toole gives the performance of a lifetime as Swann, an alternately laugh out loud funny and heartbreakingly warm performance that earned him an Oscar nomination, yet somehow Linn-Baker somehow manages to hold his own and never allows O'Toole to blow him off the screen. O' Toole and Linn-Baker get solid support from Lainie Kazan as Benji's mother, Joseph Bologna as King Kaiser, the star of Comedy Calvacade, Cameron Mitchell as a not-too bright gangster, and Adolph Green as the manic producer of the show. A good looking, smartly-written superbly written comedy that documents a long gone era in entertainment history and tells a warm and amusing story as well.

Benjamin's direction is excellent, and Peter O'Toole ( playing, it must be said, a variant of himself), is wonderful, as is most of the rest of the cast. Benjamin shows a sure comic touch in his debut. In short, like Quiz Show, one of the best movies about the fifties, and one of the best movies about the early days of television.

While it is actually true that the humour here isn't too original, the execution is so irresistibly sure all can be forgiven. Even certain emotional, life lesson -like moments didn't bother me, for they have been done with utmost class.The film flows flawlessly through its duration, and hardly anything seems out of place; there's no forced (I stress that word) emotionality to be found. Those things alone are something you don't often get. It has a splendid look to it, with the bright colours and the design, the costumes contributing to the wonderfully old-fashioned and fresh feel it has (how convenient).The script is full of almost-priceless moments and witty one-liners and otherwise hilarious dialogue. I would imagine the film is of high re-watch value. It is by no means without its share of problems, though. As said, there's little that's not been done elsewhere, but the finished film works so well as a whole I can but say that all the praise is deserved. Needless to say, while the rest of the cast delivers, it is O'Toole's magnificently (un)steady and hilarious performance that lifts this one to heights. "}{"Title":"Sid Caesar, Errol Flynn, Mel Brooks, and Jimmy Hoffa meet  incognito","Date":"29 July 2006","Score":"9 out of 9 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy","Review":" This was a very funny comedy set in the New York City of 1954-55, and involving the likes of three or four figures that normally did not have much in common, though three were in the entertainment field, and they would occasionally (or almost occasionally) work together. The fourth was less funny, but would (in his own way) be as much a figure of historical interest (even more so since he vanished).In 1954, live television was the major part of the nightly line up of shows, especially variety shows. And the leading one of the day was Sid Caesar's YOUR SHOW OF SHOWS, with it's skillful blending of musical numbers and high comedy - satire skits. Even today, years after most of the shows have vanished (except for those on kines-cope) they remain legendary. Caesar had (for awhile) Mel Brooks working as a writer on his show. He also, on one occasion, planned to have Errol Flynn appear as a guest. Flynn did variety shows occasionally - he once appeared on Steve Allen's show, spoofing TO TELL THE TRUTH (he was one of three people claiming to be Flynn, one of the others being an overly confident Don Knotts wearing a little mustache). The story about Flynn's near appearance with Caesar was not as pleasant - he decided to take a powder at the last moment and did not show up for the final taping.Based on that story we have this film, wherein Flynn becomes Alan Swann, swashbuckling hero of films of yore. Swann is to appear on THE KING KAISER SHOW with it's star (Joe Bologna). Bologna is as mercurial and difficult as Caesar supposedly was, and when upset at some comments made by Brook's film version Benjy Stone (Marc Lynn-Baker), he appoints Stone to keep an eye on the notoriously tipsy and unreliable Swann to make sure he shows up for the show's rehearsals and final production.The addition of Jimmy Hoffa is interesting to this mix. The teamster boss was not really well known in 1954 (his predecessor Dave Beck was more notorious), but Hoffa's career can be shifted a few years to fit in. For the purposes of the plot, there has been a weekly segment of the show (Kaiser insists on it, showing a substantial public spirit here that is just not evident elsewhere), spoofing the thieving union racketeer (here named Karl Rojeck - Cameron Mitchell). Rojeck only physically appears in one confrontation sequence with Kaiser, in Kaiser's offices He is a no-nonsense, humorless gangster, and his eye-to-eye confrontation with Kaiser is memorable. It ends with him grabbing the over-sized homburg hat that Kaiser uses for his costume as his own and leaving the meeting with a definite threat in his voice. But although Rojeck the character never reappears, his ominous shadow follows the movie, with late deliveries of supplies to the show, and with accidents almost befalling Kaiser and his associates.As the movie progresses we concentrate mostly on Benjy's growing friendship with Alan Swann. Yes he drinks and womanizes too much, but he does show the young writer what is worthwhile about living, and he even blends in with Benjy's family (his mother Lainie Kazan and her second husband and Benjy's uncles and aunts). In one scene Swann is his charming self with them at a family dinner on Eastern Parkway.Alan turns out to be a fairly complex figure - he realizes his glamorous image is not at all like his real, flawed self. And he knows he is selfish at times. But he is also genuinely timid about one creature the little daughter he barely knows who lives in Connecticut. This is his achilles heel and it makes the audience realize that for all the glamor and fame he is not a happy man. How Alan (with Benjy's help) pulls himself together and shows he can live up to his image is the heart of the movie. Peter O'Toole gives his best comic performance in this movie, abetted by Linn-Baker, Bologna, Selma Diamond (whose face glows when O'Toole shows her what he has to make a woman happy), Kazan, Bill Macy and the rest of the film. It turns out to be one's favorite movie about that favorite year.

The first time I saw this movie I laughed from beginning to end. Mark Lynn Baker plays the Benji Stone (the young Brooks) whose real name is Stoneberg. He has the right innocence for role. He gives a great performance. But this movie is Peter O'Toole's. He plays a larger then life Earol Flynn character. He is drunk and about to be thrown out of the country by the IRS. He teaches young Stone the difference between the man and the star, and how stardom sometimes overtakes the man's own identity. One of high point of the movie is when Baker takes O'toole have dinner in his mother's apartment in Brooklyn. O'toole also coaches Baker on getting the girl of his dreams, played by Jessica Harper. One of the great scenes has Mark Lynn Baker trying to teach Harper how to tell a joke. All this takes place with the backdrop of late 1950's television. A time where TV was still a novelty. Every scene makes you at least smile, and most make you laugh out loud. Richard Benjiman show great skill as a director even though this one of his earliest films.

O'Toole has a tax problem and he's agreed to do an appearance on a top rated television comedy show of the Fifties to satisfy Uncle Sam's lien on his future income and to avoid deportation. But by now he's a boozy shadow of his former self and the star of the show Joseph Bologna assigns his most junior writer, Mark Linn-Baker to keep him in reasonable condition to perform.As it turns out it means bringing O'Toole into his world which is Jewish Brooklyn of the Fifties, something I'm somewhat familiar with myself. Baker and O'Toole become a marvelous comedy duo themselves here. I'm surprised they did not team to do a whole lot more films than this. O'Toole's performance succeeds on a lot of levels. Yes it's pretty funny, sidesplittingly funny at times. But there's also an element of sadness in it as well. You see in film clips the man O'Toole once was and now only commands attention by making a public spectacle of himself at times. I knew someone like that in my life, one who hardly had any kind of a career, but also HAD to be the center of attention at all times and usually did it by getting riotously drunk and acting abominably dumb. He had a certain charm and could get away with it, a lot though not the way O'Toole does.Based on Mel Brooks's recollections of having to work with Errol Flynn, the film lets you know it's Flynn were remembering. Note the almost step by step choreographed duel recreation of Flynn and Basil Rathbone's final duel from The Adventures of Robin Hood. Joseph Bologna is great as the egotistical comedy star and the Brooklyn vignette has a great performance by Lainie Kazan as Baker's most Jewish mother and Lou Jacobi as his most Jewish uncle.Still it's what goes on and what's between O'Toole and Baker that makes My Favorite Year an all time comedy classic.

With the exception noted above, there isn't a missed beat from a single cast member, and Bologna and Kazan are particularly notable.But the movie belongs to Peter O'Toole, and, as in The Stunt Man (made a few years earlier), when he's on screen you can barely take your eyes off him. Whether being hysterically funny or terribly sad, he owns the screen from start to finish. From the first shot of him, waking up embracing what he thinks is an unremembered lover from the drunken night before, and staring in bewilderment and near terror as he realizes that it's not a girl at all but a furry THING (a teddy bear), to the last shot of him as he accepts an ovation from the studio audience in probably the only truly serene joy he's had in decades, he is utterly perfect and utterly compelling. Richard Benjamin may have directed well, the script may have been terrific, the supporting performers excellent, but this movie could not have been what it was without O'Toole's presence and brilliance.It's hard to imagine a more enjoyable way to spend an hour and a half than in watching this movie. There are so many little jokes, so many big jokes, such lovely and REAL touching moments. It is, despite its occasional hilarity, a very gentle and loving movie; there's just no meanness in it, which is a very pleasant and rather unusual thing, especially in a comedy.

But let's not forget that he was nominated for an Academy Award for this film, as well.Why is this my favorite O'Toole film? Because it's nice to see an actor not taking himself quite so seriously. And most of O'Toole's films were damned serious. This is rollicking fun, and as O'Toole' character points out early in the film, Death is easy, comedy is hard. And indeed, that is so true. Comedy is tough! And that shows O'Toole's brilliance all the more, because we are used to seeing him in dramas. So I feel that here he is at his very best, challenged by being an actor who is acting funny, rather than a comedian doing what comedians do.The script, too, is brilliant. It seems to be based loosely on when Errol Flynn guested on Sid Caesar's comedy show...not that there were the fireworks that are portrayed here in this film. But, as hilarious as it is, it's also a very touching film. A washed alcoholic actor who can still buckle his swash. An estranged father who hasn't the courage to talk to his daughter. And a young man given the responsibility of managing an actor gone wild...and their adventures in Brooklyn and at a dinner party. It isn't just a funny movie. It's got real heart mixed in with the laughs...and I do laugh out loud when I watch this film.Mark Linn-Baker, an actor I've never seen in any other movie or television show (although I know he has been in several) is just right as the young studio aide whose job it is to manage O'Toole's character. Joseph Bologna is great as the Caesar-ish comedian. I enjoyed seeing the wonderful singer Lainie Kazan as Linn-Baker's mother. And Lou Jacobi as the uncle. I was very interested to see Adolph Green -- the famous composer -- as the television show's director. And Selma Diamond as the wardrobe woman.

O'Toole is just masterful in the part and according to director Benjamin, he even insisted on doing all his own stunts (some of which were dangerous!). I could believe him as a movie hero and as a real-life washout.Joseph Balogna is just hysterical as the Sid Caesar TV star, rough, bombastic, occasionally mean, but kind under the crust, and utterly fearless.

But it's my favorite movie, and in a house where we own something like 5,000 movies and most of our conversations contain at least one movie quote, this film is quoted almost daily, so that's saying something.

And the following evening, I had to watch the movie again.The beginning with the outline of New York City as Nat King Cole's Stardust played, was truly a magical combination, a high point with even more high points to come! Just what was it that made this movie so funny and so enjoyable? Was it the swash buckling washed out Alan Swann (played by Peter OToole) as he moved from one situation after another? Or was it Benjy Stone (Mark Linn-Baker) as he tried unsuccessfully to keep Swann out of trouble, only to wind up becoming an involuntary accomplice to Swann's wild schemes, and realizing that he was actually enjoying himself, having every bit as much fun as Swann? Maybe it was King Kaiser (Joseph Bologna), with his outrageous outbursts and unreasonable demands. King Kaiser's writing staff with those connivers, ready to tell their boss off, only to turn into a team of cowardly yes-men, the moment he showed up, is worth its weight in gold.Maybe it was the performance of Cameron Mitchell as Karl Rojeck as he had that face off with King Kaiser?Come to think of it, the correct answer here is all of the above! It was sad, though, to see Selma Diamond, with that cigarette dangling out of her mouth, knowing that within 3 years, her smoking would turn her into the Late Selma Diamoind as lung cancer would claim yet another life.The use of equipment used in the late 1950s as opposed to equipment used in 1954, is on little or no relevance unless you've been working in a television studio since the early 1950s. While a lot of work was put into the styles and fashions of the time, leaving no detail overlooked, I couldn't help noticing that some of the men wore their hair a little too long for the time.

Fortunately the film makers were able to get Peter O'Toole, radiating star quality and charisma, and he could not possibly be better. Tender, humorous, dramatic, almost always over the top and also always a bit sad this is without question some of his best work in a career full of great performances.

When he is assigned to appear in a live TV show as guest star, his reputation for booze gets him assigned to the care of Benjy Stone (MARK LINN-BAKER), a Brooklyn kid whose job it is to protect O'Toole from further exploits with the bottle so that he can perform as scheduled before a live audience.That's basically the plot, derived from a true-life situation involving Errol Flynn's appearance on, presumably, Sid Caesar's Saturday night live show, Your Show of Shows. In the film, we have Joseph BOLOGNA in the Sid Caeasar role, an egotistical bully in over-sized suits who struts around bellowing orders to everyone. And once the tale leaves the studio to the home of Benjy Stone's abode in Brooklyn, the comedy gets into even higher gear for laughter--thanks largely to LAINIE KAZAN as Benjy's Jewish mother.Well paced, stacked with laughs, and played to the hilt by an ingratiating cast of comic professionals. Richard Benjamin can take a bow for directing this with flourish. Peter O'Toole gives one of his best, wickedly funny performances as the matin√©e idol who finds it hard to separate his adventurous screen self from real life. He performs his various pratfalls and stunts (or someone else does) with apparent ease. While O'Toole is great, his co-star, Mark Linn-Baker comes close to stealing several scenes with comic finesse.Trivia note That's GLORIA STUART as the lady at the Stork Club that O'Toole dances with.

The substance abuse, the wrecked relationships, the legal scandals; by the end of his life he was a guy who needed a lot of rehabilitating. My Favorite Year is a posthumous rehabilitation of Flynn, and it is also a sweet and funny tall tale about what his redemption might have looked like had it happened during his lifetime. Flynn's actual appearance on the 1950s variety show where Mel Brooks was a young writer came and went without incident, but in My Favorite Year that forgettable television moment is reimagined as one huge, crazy, boozy incident worthy of Peter O'Toole in his hellraising days. O'Toole infuses all of Flynn stand-in Alan Swann's lines, every flourish of his hands, every drunken stagger, with a precise mixture of charm and pain.The story is mostly a buddy comedy of the sort that thrives on the emotional closeness of its characters. Maybe a supremely irresponsible person like Swann, whose insecurities cause him to limit his relationships to the categories of one-night stands and autograph sessions, wouldn't really tolerate the presence of a straight-laced worrywart like the Mel Brooks stand-in for days and nights on end. But in the movies, opposites attract, and here they make a good pair. The young writer gets to meet his hero, and although Swann is a case in point of why it's not always best to do that, the movie argues that the hero is always there, in a way, inside the less-than-heroic has- been. Swann is self-destructive, yes, but with each new failure comes a chance for one more last hurrah, one more horse to jump on and ride into the sunset, one more crowd to win over. O'Toole is heartbreaking when he shows Swann's weakness and vulnerability, and this makes each new triumph, however modest, all the more inspiring. At the high points, the young writer is the necessary sidekick, a witness to a performance that exists solely to be seen and applauded, and when the cycle returns to darkness and doubt he is the hero's conscience. It's an old formula, but it works.Between the party-crashing, horse-stealing vignettes, there is a by-the- book romance storyline and an organized crime farce. Both are simple fare, but they do a lot to raise the stakes of Swann's television appearance and to set an amiable atmosphere through a vibrant supporting cast and obvious but endearing jokes and set- pieces. The movie's various threads all crash together in a big finish that is predictable, and not believable, but very satisfying, entertaining, and moving&#x97;not unlike a great Errol Flynn movie.Replete with tributes to Flynn's filmography, My Favorite Year is a must-see for fans of the Australian-born swashbuckler. Captain Blood, Dodge City, and The Adventures of Robin Hood are repeatedly and lovingly referenced, under thinly-disguised alternate titles, and the iconic scene from the ending of Robin Hood is recreated in astonishing detail, complete with a Basil Rathbone lookalike.

Swann, beautifully played by Peter O'Toole is a washed out movie star infamous for his drinking and making unsavory headlines. This leads to some very funny scenarios as Stone works overtime to watch over his colorful hero. There are also wonderful heartwarming scenes between Benjy and Swann and both quickly find out they have things in common. Benjy is embarrassed by some of his relatives and wants to hide his mother's offbeat marriage. Swann shares his secret of Tess, a daughter he has never visited. My Favorite Year has a talented cast including Lainie Kazan as Stone's mother and Joseph Bologna as King Kaiser, the star of the television show. After a mob boss wants the sketch parody of him scratched from the show, accidents start to happen. Keiser refuses to do away with the characterization for the show and it results in funny outcomes on stage before a live audience. Hiding his insecurities especially around K.C.Downing (Jessica Harper) a coworker Benjy has a crush on, Swann gives Benjy romantic advice. These two unlikely characters bond over the course of the film. Reminiscent of real television programs like Your Show of Shows with Sid Ceasar, Screenplay writer, Dennis Palumbo was inspired to write this enjoyable screenplay when he found out producer Mel Brooks worked as a comedy writer and had to keep an eye on movie star Errol Flynn. When Swann finds out the television show is shot live minutes before the show opens, he panics and threatens to walk out of the studio. Swann, accustomed to doing several movie takes, declares he can not do the live show, I'm not an actor, I'm a movie star! My Favorite Year takes place in 1954 and Benjy's narration at the beginning and end of the story, gives the film a nice nostalgic touch. There are so many funny and memorable scenes throughout. Richard Benjamin does a great job in his directorial film debut. But it is O'Toole who practically steals the show with a fantastic performance that earned him an Oscar nomination.

It's a fast going, snappy comedy, that doesn't necessarily force or exaggerate its comedy, to any extreme forms. It's playing things more subtly and more often relies on its dialog and actors, rather than on any comical situations. It makes the movie very pleasant and likable, also because it manages to maintain its good quick pace throughout its entire running time.The story really doesn't matter all that much for this movie, other than taking the characters from the one place and situation to the other. I'm not saying that it isn't any good but to me it just wasn't important for what this movie was all about and trying to do. Even the weaker moments in this movie and its story still work out well, thanks to its characters and the actors portraying them.Peter O'Toole plays Errol Flynn, even though his character is named differently in the movie. But he is Flynn and even plays some of the sequences out of some classic Errol Flynn movies. This all was great fun to watch and his presence truly adds a lot to this movie as well. He's perfectly classy and often despicable at the same time. But Mark Linn-Baker was also truly great! Whatever went wrong with his career? He was not only a great comedy actor but simply just a great actor in general as well. The movie has a more old fashioned type of comedy vibe to it, like a '40's production, which is also the time period this movie is being set in (well, the '50's but still), so it's no big surprise or a coincidence all.

The pacing, casting and plot are expertly woven by director Richard Benjamin to create an inside look at early T. V. production and a crazy Jewish family. The scene of Swan attending dinner in Brooklyn with staff writer Benjy Stone's family is one of the funniest in screen history due in equal parts to the fantastic performances of O'Toole, Lou Jacobi (as a scene-stealing Uncle Mortie) and Lainie Kazan as the mother of all Jewish mothers. As Swann, O'Toole manages to be loathsome, endearing, infuriating, charming and vulnerable.

The opening shots of the classic New York skyline bring back fond memories of films set in New York like On the Town and Bells Are Ringing, both of which opened with very similar views (and both of which had lyrics by Adolph Green, who appears in the film as Leo). There are many parallels to classic comedy in a broader sense as well, like the relationship between has-been swashbuckling icon Alan Swann (Peter O'Toole) and his chauffeur/manservant which mirrors the classic Jeeves and Wooster dichotomy loosely.The story is very straightforward &#150; Swann must make an appearance on a TV variety show hosted by King Kaiser (Joe Bologna) to appease the IRS. When he shows up plastered (so are some of the best erections in Europe! he exclaims) for the first rehearsal he risks losing the job but is saved by nerdy writer Benjy Stone (Mark Linn-Baker), who must act as his chaperone for the rest of the week in NYC. In the course of that week Stone somewhat accidentally teaches Swann that what he's missing the most is a solid family relationship, and Swann teaches Stone how to be more confident and go after the things that he wants at all costs. There's also an interesting theme here concerning what we choose to show to other people. Stone confesses that his name is Steinbaum or something like that, a very Jewish name, and Swann confesses about his child whom he has not seen in years. The idea I think is that no one would guess that these two very hyper-kinetic and funny individuals were harboring such pain and guilt, but they are able to tell each other because of the mutual respect that exists between friends.I thought the movie was very funny although in the end the plot about Swann's family becomes a bit too obvious and sentimental. But there are just too many hilarious moments to complain too much. The only other comedy I've seen with O'Toole was What's New Pussycat?, which I thought was kind of lame. He was very, very funny in this one. An even bigger surprise is Joe Bologna in the role of a Sid Caesar-esquire comedian full of swagger and arrogance, a man who would probably blame the pope if he slipped on a banana peal in the Vatican. The scene where he squares up with a tough gangster (played by the appropriately surly Cameron Mitchell, taking quite a big step up from his recent films like Tool Box Murders) is one for the ages. And unlike a lot of show- business comedies that end in the big show (even The Producers) the conclusion of this film was far from a let-down.I really felt like I was watching a film from the classic era &#150; not just because of the high quality of the script and the actors, but because this film knows how to present an innocent kind of charm in a sophisticated way; it's a far cry from the juvenile (though occasionally hilarious) films being pumped out of the teenage movie factory that Hollywood became in the 1980s. In other words, it's a film with class and integrity. And speaking of The Producers, I think a musical version of this film might be a very good idea.

Set in 1954, Baker plays a young NBC writer for a live TV show starring a Sid Caesar type (Bologna). He is put in charge of a drunken film swashbuckler named Alan Swann (O'Toole) to keep him sober and make sure he shows up for the rehearsals and the performance. This includes bringing Swann (totally based on Errol Flynn) to his family's home in Brooklyn for dinner, riding on a stolen policeman's horse through Central Park, and witnessing Swann going over a rooftop with a fireman's hose tied around him. That's actually the good news. All goes well until Swann realizes it's going to be a live show. I played before an audience once! he screams. I was a butler. I had one line. I forgot it. One of my favorite lines was made all the more hysterical by O'Toole throwing it away - when he's questioned about going to the Stork Club, he says, Why not? It's been a year. Surely they've fixed the wall and replaced the bandstand. The film captures the egomania of the TV star with Bologna's fabulous portrayal of King Kaiser, who is being threatened by a mobster (Cameron Mitchell) due to his weekly impersonation of the man; their scene together is a riot. Mark Linn-Baker is delightful. The other actors fit their roles to a T. As far as O'Toole, what can be said? As Alan Swann, he is sheer perfection - dissipated but handsome, drunken but charming, frustrating but lovable - a man who hides his sorrows, fear and loneliness in drink and debauchery. A truly great portrayal that doesn't simply rely on the surface comedy but lets you see the man beneath.Director Richard Benjamin gives us the feel of '50s New York and live TV in all of its excitement and keeps the pace going beautifully.

Here he gets the opportunity to play Alan Swann, a swashbuckling movie star that is not too far from the real Peter O'Toole, who almost destroyed his career with booze.  As you might expect, he played the part exceptionally.  His Oscar-nominated work stands out from the rest of the film, which is not shabbily done either.As I saw this movie late one night on TCM, where a great many of the showcased films are in letterbox/widescreen format, the cinematography may have looked better than it would have looked on Encore, but it still captures the eye.  The '50s were full of bright color to me, and the opening scenes reflect that well.  Richard Benjamin's direction subtly adds depth to the film among extravagant and wacky characters and settings, and it should be applauded for that reason.The acting is not bad either.  O'Toole's Swann steals almost every scene he appears in, even with that drunken accent and horribly gaunt face.  I thoroughly enjoyed the scene with his daughter later on in the film, which adds more depth to his character through absence of expression than any other drunken scene of his.  Joseph Bologna is good as the Sid Caesar prototype who, behind the scenes, treats all beneath him like dirt.  Mark Linn-Baker (what was that series with Bronson Pinchot that I remember him from?) looks younger than I ever remebered him as Benjy Stone, and he plays his awed part with a warmth and balls (an odd combination, sure).  Minor characters add depth and laughs.The writing by Dennis Palumbo contains many one-liners that stand out after the movie's end.  I'm not an actor, I'm a movie star! comes to mind. Minor complaints  the romance in the film is hoky and forced, and must have only been in the film to either add depth to Benjy Stone's character or to fill up time requirements.  As other comments have said, some of the scenes are contrived and cliched, but after the film you forget it and remember the good stuff.Overall  see this for O'Toole.  It appears the bottle only changed his looks, not his talents.  I liked this movie after it was finished. 7/10 "}{"Title":"Classic, but a comment on the new DVD","Date":"7 August 2002","Score":"3 out of 4 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy","Review":"  Without a doubt one of my all-time favorite movies, but alas...

Richard Benjamin's commentary, while acknowledging a few bits of delicious insight, was basically just an egotistical expose' of what it takes to be a director.I do suppose that is his forte', but this CLASSIC movie screams for some real tidbits about the interplay between Show of Shows characters and who each person was playing and why. There was SOME of this, but not nearly enough, not by a L O N G shot! Being too young to have seen these events taking place puts me at a disadvantage, but the powers that be could have taken a listen to Benjamin's commentary and easily seen how unsatisfactory it was, or is it just another case of a forgotten movie being put out to soak up whatever profits it possibly has left?Well, if they ever decide to put out another edition with writers commentary, I promise to buy one!

What a sight that competition must have been. Then we have him on another level as our character Swann who himself is an actor confused with the roles he plays.Fresh from a similar but more nuanced role in `Stunt Man,' O'Toole shifts among these three layers with aplomb. He is extraordinary, but the situation would not have been, were it not for all the little multilayered embellishments-Real life Brooks (the man behind the production) appears as a character, Sy Benson, the guy who writes for the stage no less.-Another character, Kaiser, is a portrayal of real life Caesarso far, still pretty ordinary but then-the writer and the actor write a skit that parodies a `real' man, taking the actor/real levelling in a new dimension. And of course that `real' man is a film stereotype himself.That's pretty sophisticated structure. Its not highly cinematic like deVito would have done (`Smoochy'), instead arranged as the sort of skits depicted in the skits. And it does reference Proust (Swann) while using his layering devices, just as Brooks had begun the previous year with  `Elephant Man.'You get a summary of what this is all about in the first scene, this project is figuratively sex with multiple, simultaneous partners.Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 4 Worth watching.

I shall admit right at the start that I absolutely loved every single second of this movie. As a comedy this thing is pretty flawless as it keeps you laughing from start to finish thanks to one of the best screenplays from the era and not to mention the wonderful performances by everyone in the cast. The story is quite simple and there are certainly a few areas where the script appears to be talking about the real O'Toole but man, what a tremendous performance he gives. If anyone you know doubts that O'Toole was one of the greatest actors in the history of cinema then they just need to watch this film to see comedy done to perfection. I was really shocked at how wonderful O'Toole was at the humor but his comic timing can match up against the geniuses of the genre and the way he turns on the charm is just pure delight. I really mean it when I say that the performance is flawless and even with the one tender moment at the end, the actor is so terrific that you can't take your eyes off of him. Linn-Baker is also very good in the supporting role and we get strong performances from the entire cast including Joseph Bologna, Bill Macy, Jessica Harper and even Cameron Mitchell. The screenplay just offers up so many terrific lines that it's hard to imagine one film containing so many. I honestly think there were at least thirty quotable lines and all of them just constantly had you laughing. Some of them are quite clever while some of them have O'Toole just winking at you about his own reputation. MY FAVORITE YEAR is without question one of the best comedies of its type and it's also a loving tribute to the live television shows of the 1950's.

Instead, everyone backstage appears to be rushing around like spinning tops. Even the alleged star King Kaiser (Bologna) can't seem to keep the order of his skits straight. Looks to me like bibulous guest star Alan Swann (O'Toole) should fit right in, drunk or sober. Then there's poor young schlemiel (Linn-Baker) who gets to baby-sit Swann when not pursuing a fruitless romance with the comely K.C. (Harper). Mix in a bunch of mobsters who don't like being made fun of, and you've got a finale to end all finales, even if the mayhem is every TV producer's nightmare.Now I'm really curious whether the old Sid Caesar show was really as wild backstage as the movie presents it. At the time, I was a faithful watcher, so the hijinks here come as a special revelation. But what else could you expect from backstage characters like Caesar's writers Mel Brooks and Woody Allen. Anyhow, this was Dick Benjamin's first directorial outing even though you'd never know it. Then too, credit O'Toole with coming up with a really sly performance that alternates between drunken stupor and charming finesse. I particularly like it when Swann reveals his real self but still shifts gears into the movie swashbuckler when needed.All in all, it's a wacko comedy well deserving its place on Premiere's Top 50 comedies of all time.

Mel Brooks is listed as the exec producer, not sure how much influence he had with this script credited to Dennis Palumbo and Norm Steinberg and directed by comedy veteran Dick Benjamin. The story seems somewhat autobiographical of Brooks- being about a young Jewish comedy writer (Benjy Stone) on a TV show similar to legendary Your Show of Shows who has been given the assignment of watching over the weeks guest star, acting great Alan Swann. Swann had been a swashbuckling star of action movies in the 30's and 40's and has a well- deserved reputation as a top notch boozer and womanizer and if it sounds reminiscent of Errol Flynn, it's supposed to be. Swann is played perfectly in a hilarious acting job by the great Peter O'Toole, not known for his comedic roles, but he nails this. As does Joseph Bologna, playing King Kaiser, obviously based on Sid Caeser, the star of The Comedy Cavalcade. King is an egotistical loudmouth who has found himself in trouble with the mob for his parody sketch of union boss, Karl Rojack, called Boss Hijack. Another great comedy performance is Lainie Kazan, as the zaftig Belle Carroca, Benjy's widowed mother who has remarried a former Filipino prizefighter. Hard to believe that barely a decade earlier Lainie had posed for Playboy but she is superb as the plump Jewish mother hosting the great Alan Swann at a dinner in her Brooklyn apartment. MFY has a funny and clever script, my only complaints are Mark Linn-Baker as Benjy, he's not bad but it could have been so much better with a better comedy actor, perhaps Billy Crystal. Also Jessica Harper provides no real sparks as KC, Benjy's love interest. Still the movie is about O'Toole's outrageous portrayal of Errol Flynn who reminds us I'm not an actor, I'm a movie star!

The plot is told from the point of view of young television writer Benjy Stone who has been charged with keeping the guest star of a live Saturday night television show in line through rehearsals and onto the show itself. This is not easy task given that the guest is none other than the Errol-Flynn-esquire Alan Swann, the legendary lothario and drinker. The narrative charts their escapades over the week and sees them learn lessons from one another (to a point).I say to a point because the plot is not that strong when you go much below the superficial and indeed there isn't the action/reaction that I expected from the character dynamics &#x96; or at least it is not that strong on the page. This is a bit of a weakness in the film &#x96; not that I wanted it to be serious or insightful but more that I felt it could have done with being a little sharper and more structured in regards its characters. That said, what it leaves is a rather superficial and frothy film and this is in no way a totally bad thing because it plays into this very well. The word of the day for me was whimsy with this &#x96; because it seems to have been founded on a bed of nostalgia for a particular place and time that may not even have existed. Given that nostalgia (as opposed to reality) is the foundation, it was wise to build with a whimsical comedic approach because the two things compliment each other well as the various backstage shenanigans and characters get on. It is an odd coincidence that this all occurs in 30 Rockefeller Plaza because the exaggerated antics and 100% comedic characters did very much put me in mind of 30 Rock &#x96; not as funny perhaps but the base elements were very similar.It is a comedy though and, while I was not laughing out loud very often, I did have several good laughs and otherwise found myself quite charmed by the amusing material. There are some great lines but there are also plenty of funny little characters around the edges to provide chuckles and feed into the overall comedy (for example the throwaway creation of Rookie Carroca, which is odd but yet very funny). As in 30 Rock today, the cast here are a massive part of making the comedy work and in particular carrying off the whimsy and silliness so that it remains charming and does not become stupid or grating. Linn-Baker is the narrative-device and as such he is pretty good, doing enough so that we like him and care a bit in regards his character's romantic ambitions but never pushing himself forward so that he challenges the main show in town &#x96; which is O'Toole. With his wonderful swagger and droll delivery of his lines, O'Toole nails his comedy character perfectly and is very funny doing it (his finest moment being the for ladies only exchange). OK at times the material lets him down (the more serious character moments towards the end jar a little in contrast with the rest of his performance) but otherwise he is very good. Harper is cute and works well with both men, while Bologna is a blast from the past that is simple but effective while the rest of the support cast has plenty of recognisable faces doing great little comic characters (Kazan, Hoffman, De Salvo, I could go on).My Favourite Year doesn't have the substance that the narrative (and narration) suggests that it will have and perhaps is a little unsatisfying if you are trying to take it even slightly seriously as a story but if you are even vaguely in the mood it is hard not to be charmed by it. With nostalgic whimsy as the approach the film delivers laughs that range from the slap-stick to the witty and, while you'll not be rolling on the floor it produced such consistent chuckles for me that it was hard not to enjoy it despite its apparent weaknesses in other areas. Not a classic comedy that will stand for all time, but one that more than does the job for its own running time, which in fairness is all you should be asking of it.

Best of all, the film has so much heart, so much emotion packed between the laughs, that no matter how many times I see it, I end up with a lump in my throat.  It's wonderful.

The movie isn't bad, it's just sort of THERE.Mark Linn-Baker is likable enough in a schlubby kind of way, much as he was in his 80s sitcom Perfect Strangers. Lainie Kazan also has some pizazz as a Jewish broad. Otherwise, I don't even remember much about the film, except that Peter O'Toole at one point comes swinging into a room on a chandelier.Grade C+ "},{"Title":"Painful","Date":"8 June 2008","Score":"","Genre":"Comedy","Review":" Mr. O'Toole's talents are utterly wasted in this disjointed film, notably for a handful of half-fulfilled subplots that were either neglected or summarily solved. (ie. Alan Swann, we are told, did go to Conneticut and did talk with his estranged daughter, lazy reliance on narration to shortcut any meaningful film-making. Or what of Benjy Stone's romance, or his feelings with regard to his name change?) I felt a little sorry for Mr. O'Toole, utterly overshadowing a cast of talentless cardboard cutouts that either overact or forget to act at all. The themes of the film, dealing largely with the distinction between celebrity and real life are poorly developed and less than original.

One of my favorite films Richard Benjamin's wonderfully comic valentine to The Golden Age of Comedy in television about rookie comedy writer Linn-Baker with his hands full keeping his movie idol and guest host alcoholic actor Alan Swann (Oscar nominee for Best Actor O' Toole; brilliant a la Errol Flynn) sober and in condition for the big show. Great depiction of back stage shenanigans on a live variety show based on Sid Caesar's Your Show of Shows with Bologna uncanny as a Caesar-like prima donna. Jessica Harper is Baker's lovely love interest.

O'Toole received a lot of praise for his acting in this film, and deservedly so, but all the performances are great.  There are a few flaws - some of the jokes fall flat, some of the situations are a bit cliched, but overall this film is a skilled blend of satire and tenderness.

In a few of these roles Peter O'Toole has had moments of sheer comedic energy.  However, these moments fade as Lawrence fires a gun for the first time or as the king mourns the loss of Becket. Yet in My Favorite Year, Peter O'Toole is given a comedian's chance and has truly glimmered with pure hilariousness.

What's new about that? O'Toole was usually nominated and 25 years later, he may very well receive his 8th nomination for Venus.His 7th nomination for this poor film was ridiculous. He plays a Scottish actor who has a daughter living in Connecticut but he doesn't know that Brooklyn exists on the map until he is taken there by Marc Linn-Baker, a Brooklyn College dropout who works for a television station.A certain show has hired him to appear on it. Though a former movie star, he needs the work to pay off his IRS debts.He acts in a swashbuckling way in the tradition of Errol Flynn. Problem here is that he is no Mr. Flynn.A usually funny supporting cast has little to do here. As his mother, Lainie Kazan provides her usual Jewish motions even though she has remarried in the film to a Chinese gentleman. Her brother, played by Lou Jacobi, lacks any decency. Lou, it was probably time to retire after this one. Selma Diamond works in wardrobe with that darn cigarette dangling from her mouth. If she would only have known that it would kill her within the next few years.Joe Bologna plays a television star who has problems of his own. There is a brief appearance by Cameron Mitchell. Shame that this wonderful actor ended his career with this stiff.To make matters worse, the film soon deteriorates into slapstick comedy. O'Toole and company deserved far better than this. Come on Pete, maybe your 8th attempt will hit Oscar gold!

Yet, Peter O'Toole, playing a tippling film star in the 1950s reduced to appearing in a live television program, doesn't do anything here acting-wise he hadn't already accomplished (under far better circumstances). Underling Mark Linn-Baker is assigned to get the great thespian ready for his performance, but the actor's drinking (and hamming) causes chaos for everyone. A benign enterprise, buoyed somewhat by Linn-Baker's refined work, however O'Toole is way over the top (his first scene is merely duplicated throughout, with very little shading). A classy supporting cast certainly helps, but there are few genuine laughs. *1/2 from **** "},{"Title":"I walked out of the theater","Date":"22 April 2004","Score":"6 out of 25 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy","Review":"  I realize that My Favorite Year is a popular movie, and for all of you who enjoyed, it... well, God bless you. I absolutely detested it. It suffered just one problem, but the problem is a pip as far as I could see, there wasn't an original joke in the film.I was finally propelled from my seat after Mark Linn-Baker (who reached the zenith of his acting career, I think, in Peter Pan ads) walked out of his room sans trousers (where do they come UP with great stuff like that? Sigh), returned a moment later and actually put his finger in the air (Eureka!) and said, My pants! I wanted to cry, it was so awful.Eric Swann is a very cool name, though. "}]
