[{"Title":"Beautifully crafted and compelling story","Date":"4 July 2000","Score":"49 out of 53 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama, Mystery, Romance","Review":"  This is a magnificent adaptation of David Guterson's acclaimed book.  Scott Hicks took on a gargantuan task in attempting to make the book into a film, not only because it was so powerful and well received, but because it was so lengthy and daedal.  The result, however, was one of the best films I have seen in quite some time.There were really three stories intricately interwoven into one.  The main story was the trial of a Japanese American for the murder of a fisherman who owned the land wrongfully taken from the accused's father.  The other two stories provide insight into critical events affecting the trial.  The first involves the childhood love affair of local newspaperman Ishmael (Ethan Hawke) and Hatsue (Youki Kudoh), who is now the wife of the accused.  He has uncovered information that can aid the defense, but his resentment for having been jilted by Hatsue stands in the way of his bringing it forth.The second ancillary story is the persecution of Japanese Americans and Japanese immigrants during World War II.  We see depictions of hatred and bigotry, as law abiding Japanese citizens are shamelessly herded into internment camps.  This seething animus serves as the psychological backdrop for the trial, which occurs in the early 1950's when the memories of the war and lost loved ones is still fresh.From a directorial and cinematography perspective, this film was nothing short of a masterpiece.  It is a cinematic work of art.  Between Hicks' brilliant camera perspectives and Robert Richardson's beautiful lighting and earth tone coloring, the film was resplendent in powerful and stirring images.  Many were so artistically done that if made into snapshots they could easily hang in any art gallery.  Each shot was meticulously thought out.  Many involved complex shots through windows, silhouette backlighting, elaborate blocking, and scenes where actors, props and camera were all moving in different directions to create fabulously fluid perspective shots that slowly unfolded to revealed the scene's full content.The editing was also fantastic.  I have seen comparison's between this editing and &#145;The Limey'.  While there is some similarity in technique, this was far more elegant and flowing, whereas `The Limey' was jumpy and disconnected.  This style of editing was absolutely necessary to adhere to the book's non linear format.  Hicks needed to insert scenes that explained the feelings and motivations of the characters, and the only way to do this was with flashbacks and jump cuts.  Despite the fact that such editing is disconcerting to a large majority of viewers, it was an artistic decision that was exactly right for the story, and seamlessly done.  The same is true of the audio overlays with monologues of characters superimposed on one another, giving great power and emphasis to certain of the characters' lines.The story itself, with all of its components, was engaging and well crafted.  Unfortunately, there was not enough time to develop more of the characters.  The scenes depicting the herding of the Japanese out of their homes for relocation were chilling.  The courtroom scenes were realistic, not forsaking court procedure for dramatic effect, as is so common nowadays.  The love scenes were sensitive, romantic and passionate without the need for sexual explicitness.From an acting perspective, this was more of an ensemble production.  All the actors gave wonderful performances, especially Youki Kudoh, who was torn between her love for Ishmael and her loyalty to her family and traditions.  Kudoh was so emotionally involved with the part that she actually began crying during the featurette when recalling one of the scenes.  Screen legend Max von Sydow was also fantastic as the aging defense attorney fighting and pleading for justice amidst the racial hatred.This is a beautifully crafted film with a compelling story.  It is a filmmaking 10/10.  It has unfortunately not found a wide audience since its strongest elements are not areas of mass appeal.  For the refined viewer who can appreciate filmmaking as an art, and enjoy an intriguing but deliberate story with exquisitely woven subtleties, this film is a delight.  For those who prefer Hollywood's movie success formula of fast paced linear stories with lots of violence, profanity, clever one liners and raunchy sex, this film will bore them to death.

It is a film about life and death, love and betrayal, passion and pain, forgiveness and redemption.  It is about the power of emotion to influence perception and memory.  It is about justice and truth.But that is not why you should see it;  You should see it for the story. For this film is so finely crafted, and the story unfolds so naturally, that it is easy to appreciate for the simple compelling drama of the narrative. You care about the characters, you care about how the trial turns out, and you ache to know the truth.The plot centers around a murder trial of a Japanese man   charged in the death of a local fisherman, and on a white reporter covering the trial. It turns out the reporter had once been in love with a Japanese woman, now the accused man's wife. This romance was shattered as World War II broke out, and the young woman and her family were rounded up with other Japanese Americans, and interred in camps.The story that unfolds is part Casablanca, part Amistad, part To Kill a Mockingbird, yet wholly original and true to itself.  It is at once a tender love story, a lesson in history, a murder mystery, and more.The story of each of the main characters is told through flashbacks that reveal how each of them has suffered because of the war and how each has to overcome this suffering.  Many of the most compelling images of the film occur in these flashbacks.  Like real lasting memories, they are moments of deep emotional significance, and include many images which you will carry in your own mind long after you have left the theater.If you look for them you may also find some symbolic or allegorical images in the film (the boat's mast resembles a cross; the fish could also be seen as a Christian symbol of sacrifice), but these elements are not heavy handed or forced, they occur naturally as important elements of the story which is set in a small fishing village on the Northwestern coast of the US in the years surrounding World War II.While I have seen many reviewers comment on how beautifully filmed and well acted this film is, I have seen a few who have somehow failed to appreciate the significance of the story.  My only caution on this account is, take care that you are not so blinded by beauty, that you fail to notice love.In short, I found this to be a brilliant, deep, uplifting engrossing, and highly satisfying film experience.

Hicks and co-writer Ron Bass move quickly into the courtroom and wisely use the trial to drive the plot, telling the backstory - the real story in this case - through a finely-woven complex of flashbacks.  The difficulty is that this story is a rich, long and emotional tale which requires a fair degree of exposition for it to be satisfying. The screenplay is superbly economical in this regard, but there is no escaping the fact that the only way to cover so much ground in a film of tolerable length is to fly over it at 30,000 feet.  The necessarily distant treatment this requires occasionally dilutes the emotional force which would have come from a more thorough and leisurely telling.  Hicks strives valiantly to compensate with a powerfully emotive score - this works, but it doesn't always hit the mark.  Rather than engendering emotion, James Newton Howard's musical is often so insistently overpowering that it locks the audience out.  On occasions I felt strangely alienated by a wall of sound when I knew I should have been in tears.  But that's a minor flaw in an otherwise excellent production.  Overall, this is an intelligent and considered adaptation - probably the best that could be made from a novel which would have been incredibly difficult to bring to the screen.  It's solidly acted, immaculately lit, and offers some of the most achingly beautiful imagery to illuminate the screen in years (the opening shots are magnificent).  Most rewarding of all is the fact that Scott Hicks takes some real stylistic risks with this film.  They don't always pay off, but when they do it's magical.

Sadly savaged by many critics, who seemed to fail to grasp the depth of the story and the beauty with which it was told because they were too busy analyzing the parts. Snow Falling on Cedars follows a mixed race love that is complicated by the onset of war. The reactions of the two principle characters betrays not only how human love can transcend itself into something greater but how those involved can find fulfillment in themselves through its sacrifice. The exquisite symbolism (you could write a book on the different things snow could symbolize after watching this) is never overplayed - in other words, the viewer can enjoy the film as entertainment without having deeper meanings rammed down their throat - but they are there in abundance, from the way the scenery is developed to small details such as the main character's name (Ishmael - meaning He whom God hears).

It is a feast for the eyes and features outstanding acting.  It also has a sense of balance.  It doesn't manipulate its viewer.  The murder mystery isn't one that brings in forces that threaten the main character.  The forces are prejudice and fear.  The adversaries are not people carrying guns but rather the legal system that often overlooked the rights of people of another race or ethnic background.  The internment camps are part of the backdrop.  I know that people say this is slow, but so is the process these people faced.   	 I loved the intellectual character of the young man who has to look past  his own feeling and try to bring closure to someone he will never be able to have.  The transitions are so breathtaking.  The winter scenes are a portrait of softness and violence.  My wife had read the book upon which this is based and said that the movie might be interesting.  Apparently, the producers were unwilling to go the extra mile to get this noticed.  It's a gem and deserves to be on a list of very fine movies.

What it all comes down to is having and living by a moral code, and applying that code objectively, especially in troubled times.  And the real question is, when the time comes, are we as a people capable of achieving that objectivity that is imperative in assuring true justice for all?  It's an important, legitimate question posed by director Scott Hicks in `Snow Falling On Cedars,' a very real and personal drama, that in the final analysis has a bearing of monumental proportions that ultimately defines who we are and what we are made of, while ascertaining whether or not we do, indeed, have the moral courage necessary to survive as a civilized species.It's a small town in the State of Washington; the ninth anniversary of the attack on Pearl Harbor is coming up, and a young man named Kazuo Miyamoto (Rick Yune), a much decorated American soldier during the war, is on trial for the murder of local fisherman Carl Heine (Eric Thal).  Covering the trial is reporter Ishmael Chambers (Ethan Hawke), whose father, Arthur (Sam Shepard), had been a respected newspaperman locally for many years, known as a man who was not afraid to speak from his conscience when writing an editorial, and who took a stand for the Japanese locals during the emotionally exasperating years encompassing World War II.Attempting to objectively cover Kazuo's trial, Ishmael finds himself troubled by a conflict of interests; he has a history with Kazuo's wife, Hatsue (Youki Kudoh), a former relationship reaching back to their childhood, but which ended with the onset of the war.  And Ishmael still is grappling with the bitterness he has felt since that time, born of his experiences in the military, as well as Hatsue's rejection of him.  And now he is forced to objectively observe this pivotal point in her life, watching from the sidelines and seeing first hand the effects of the prejudice that is very much alive among the local citizenry, and which threatens the assurance of an impartial judgment in Kazuo's case; a judgment that will determine the future of not only Kazuo, but of Hatsue, the woman Ishmael once loved-- and still does.Working from an intelligent screenplay (by Hicks and Ronald Bass, adapted from the novel by David Guterson), with this film Hicks demonstrates the difference between a visionary filmmaker and someone who just makes movies.  In another's hands, because of the story itself, this would have no doubt been an excellent film; with Hicks directing, however, it becomes something much more, as he has taken it beyond excellent, crafting and delivering a film that is thoroughly mesmerizing, majestic and memorable.  It's an accomplishment achieved through a visionary presentation, born of the director's sensitive approach to the material and his acute insights into the human condition.  Fully utilizing all of the magic at his disposal, Hicks has taken a good film and turned it into an emotionally involving, inspirational and visually poetic experience.  With a haunting score by James Newton Howard underscoring the magnificent cinematography of Robert Richardson, Hicks brings the era and the rural splendor of Washington State vividly to life, creating an aesthetic ambiance that makes the emotional essence of the drama almost tangible; and by exacting some incredible performances from his actors, he sustains that emotional level and combines all of these elements to make this film riveting and unforgettable.As Ishmael, Ethan Hawke gives a reserved, understated performance, through which he genuinely captures the essence of his character.  Watching him, you can sense the turmoil of a soul at cross purposes with itself, and he enables you to sample that taste of bitterness toward life he so desperately needs to overcome if he is to move on within himself to greener pastures.  With this role, Hawke was given the opportunity to do something fine, and he succeeds with one of his most memorable performances yet.Youki Kudoh turns in an extremely affecting performance, as well, as Hatsue.  With this moving portrayal of a young woman enduring unbearable inner turmoil, she fulfills the artistic promises made in previous films, such as `Mystery Train' in '89, and `Picture Bride,' in 1965.  She's a terrific actor, whose eyes are truly a window to her soul.Also adding to the success of this film are the supporting efforts of Richard Jenkins, as Sheriff Moran, and James Rebhorn as prosecutor Alvin Hooks.  But the most notable performance of all comes from Max von Sydow, who as Kazuo's defense attorney, Nels Gudmundsson, is given an opportunity to return to the kind of role that shaped his career early on under the auspices of Ingmar Bergman.  As Nels, von Sydow gives a performance made all the more powerful by the restraint and subtlety of his delivery.  He takes what to most actors would be a good part, and makes it a cohesive element of the film.  It's a performance that by all rights should have earned von Sydow an Oscar nomination, but sadly did not.The supporting cast includes Reeve Carney (Young Ishmael), Ann Suzuki (Young Hatsue), James Cromwell (Judge Fielding), Ariia Bareikis (Susan Marie), Celia Weston (Etta) and Daniel von Bargen (Carl).  In a year (1999) that saw lesser efforts acknowledged, `Snow Falling On Cedars' was inexplicably ignored at Oscar time (except for Richardson's most deserving nomination for cinematography); an injustice, to say the least, as this was clearly one of the best films of the year.  Reminiscent of Ang Lee's artistry, yet with a style uniquely his own, Hicks has given us a poetic film of rare beauty and conscience, for which he is hereby granted an Award in it's purest formThe gratitude of an appreciate audience.  10/10.

Some times a book that is still alive in one's imagination doesn't compare well with what movie people can do to it; it can go either way. Fortunately, as in the case with this work, director Scott Hicks, who also helped to adapt it for the screen, shows a sensibility for the book as it shows in the finished product. The co-writer is Ronald Bass.The film is told in flashbacks. We are given the premise of the discovery of Carl Heine's body tangled in the nets and then the film goes into the trial in which the accused man, Kazuo Miyamoto, stands trial in spite of the fact he is an innocent man. Kazuo was a man that happened to be at the scene of the crime, but had nothing to do with what happened. His only guilt was trying to get back what had been the family's land from Heine.The film goes back to the time when Ishmael and Hatsue, who is now married to Kazuo, were childhood sweethearts. We see how inseparable they were and how they didn't stand a chance because they came from different ethnic groups. Hatsue's parents want her to stick to her own kind.Prejudice is shown as Japanese immigrants living in America were interred in concentration camps. This shameful page in the history of the United States changed forever the relationship between Hatsue and Ishmael. Kazuo went to fight in WWII on the side of his adopted country. Ishamel also goes to the conflict and suffers a loss of an arm during his time at the front.Ishmael, who is seen at the trial where he is reporting the process for his own newspaper, holds the key in solving the mystery. Even though he knows he will never have Hatsue back, he does the right thing in clearing her husband's name and his innocence.The film was shot in dark tones that renders the film with a sepia finish. There is not much color in Robert Richarson's splendid cinematography as he captures the bleak atmosphere of the different times shown in the movie. The editing of Hank Corwin works well in the movie. The musical score by James Newton Howard is an elegant compliment to the images one sees on the screen.Ethan Hawke's Ishmael has little dialog in the movie, yet, his expressions contribute to make his character a complex figure throughout the film. Youki Kudoh makes a beautiful Hatsue. Rick Yune plays the accused Kazuo. The great Max Von Sydow is seen as Kazuo's lawyer, the man who clearly understood what he was fighting for; he was an upright figure who opposed the prejudice and narrow mindedness of the small town. Sam Shepard, Richard Jenkins, Eric Thal, Arija Bareikis, James Cromwell and the others in the cast make valuable contributions to the success of the film.Ultimately, this is a Scott Hicks film and he proves he had a vision in how to stage the novel for us to rejoice.

Beautifully attuned to the natural splendor of its Washington State locale, the film actually converts its setting into one of the major characters in the film.  Nature, in the form of topography, flora and weather, seems to exert, if only subliminally, as much influence on the people involved as their own actions and passions.  However, there is always a drawback to a movie being so closely tied to its physical environment  very often the background advances to the foreground, ultimately overwhelming and dwarfing the human figures that should be our primary focus.  Almost inevitably then, `Cedars' itself falls victim to this syndrome from time to time.  Despite many intriguing elements in its narrative, we do come away remembering far more the stunning landscapes of rugged stone mountains, fog-enshrouded lakes and endless rows of snow-covered cedars than the characters at the story's core.  Still, the film offers enough interest in the story and personalities to keep `Snow Falling on Cedars' relatively intriguing for the majority of its (admittedly overlong) 128-minute running time.Set in 1950, the film chronicles the effect a mysterious death of a local fisherman has on the populous of a small island community made up mostly of whites and Japanese Americans, a death that, for complicated reasons, awakens many of the racial prejudices still holding over from the recently concluded war.  As a Japanese man stands trial for the `murder,' Ishmael Chambers (Ethan Hawke), a mediocre reporter for the local paper, copes with three basic issues  his unrequited love for the defendant's Japanese wife, the flaring-up of anti-Japanese bigotry in both the past and the present, and haunting memories of his deceased father, a socially crusading newspaper publisher, in whose shadow Ishmael toils and against whose professional reputation Ishmael is tested and found wanting.The film is definitely at its most emotionally powerful in its superb middle section, which beautifully dramatizes, in flashback, the shameful deportation of these Japanese-American citizens to interment camps in California, for no crime more serious than simply being of Japanese descent. Parallels to the rounding up of Jews in Nazi Germany are never far from our minds as we witness this wholesale forced migration of a group of innocent people singled-out to assuage the prejudice and fear of an ignorant but powerful majority.  For these scenes alone, the film is most assuredly worth seeing.Unfortunately, the rest of the film cannot sustain this same intensity of deep emotional conviction.  The forbidden interracial childhood romance between Ishmael and Hatsue, the current wife of the man on trial, smacks a bit too much of tired Romeo and Juliet melodramatics.  Furthermore, Ishmael seems underdeveloped as a character, too dreamy-eyed and passive, just the kind of character that can be easily swallowed up in a film in which the background plays such a prominent part.  Moreover, the easy wrap-up of the trial is woefully unconvincing and unsatisfying both as realism and as drama.On the positive side, `Snow Falling on Cedars' boasts a fascinating dual-level structure, in which small snippets of information are introduced to us in the form of near-subliminal quick cuts representing memories or speculations on past events, often, oddly, those at which none of the characters involved in the current scene were even present.  This latter inconsistency in the film's point-of-view may seem dubious and questionable from a strictly narrative standpoint, but the format does help to flesh out the story and characters in interesting and intriguing ways, intensifying the mystery as we attempt to piece it all together to finally get a view of the whole picture.  Director Scott Hicks, along with his co-writer Ron Bass, succeeds in providing a richly detailed glimpse into a shameful episode in American history - and the lyrical quality achieved through Robert Richardson's outstanding cinematography helps the film override some of its more obvious flaws.   If one brings an attitude of patience and a fine eye for natural beauty to the film, `Snow Falling on Cedars' turns out to be quite rewarding, especially for those misguided misfits who still, at this late date, justify and defend the actions taken against the American Japanese during the war.  This film is a stunning rebuttal to both them and their idiotic notions.  For that aspect alone, `Snow Falling on Cedars' demands to be seen.

You would think that an intelligent audience might be trusted to know this without having it explained to death, and that it would need none of the self-indulgent, frequently manipulative pathos that mars this extremely kitschy film. Some of it is good. Much of it is so mistrustful of its audience that nothing--not even the deportation of the Japanese to concentration camps--can be depicted without a heavy-handed, editorializing musical score that owes more to Karl Orff than it contributes to the dramatic situation. Some of the performances, particularly that of Sam Sheperd, are excellent. The direction, the editing, are embarrassingly derivative. Characters are either impossibly noble and likable or so unambiguously dreadful that you wonder their neighbors allowed them to go on living. There is no middle ground. Shades of gray, absent from the director's mind, are nowhere to be found in his film.

The film is visually stylish and the actors handle their roles well. The story revolves around a teenage love affair between a caucasian boy and a Japanese-American girl on an island off the coast of Washington state ... and later in their adult lives ... a murder trial in which her Japanese American husband is accused of killing a local fisherman.Set in the era before, during and after the attack on Pearl Harbor, the film uses this story as a backdrop to expose the injustices that were perpetrated against innocent Japanese Americans living in the U.S.  We watch as they are stripped of their homes and belongings, victimized by racial bigotry, separated from their families and herded into federal government Relocation Centers -- an oh-so-polite term for concentration camps. What a powerful and emotionally charged topic!  The opportunities for high drama endless.  Right?Yes, but not here.  The extreme overuse of flashback/flash-forward techniques and a poorly organized screenplay combine to make this movie unbelievably difficult to follow.  It gradually degrades into a virtual mish-mash where all sense of time, place and drama are lost.  A potentially compelling film is, sadly, rendered hopelessly impotent.Very disappointing ... especially when you consider how great this film could -- and should -- have been.

(I say shoot the editors)","Date":"21 February 2007","Score":"3 out of 5 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama, Mystery, Romance","Review":" Scott Hick's Snow Falling on Cedars is a lovely film &#150; really it is. Based on the book by David Guterson, Snow Falling on Cedars surrounds a murder trial taking place on a small fishing island off the coast of Washington State. Kazuo Miyamoto (Rick Yune) is on trial for the murder of a fisherman, Carl Heine (Eric Thal). But of course, the trial isn't simply a matter of murder, it's a matter of racial prejudice in a post-WWII era. Covering the story for the local newspaper is Ishmael Chambers (Ethan Hawke); who just happens to be in love with Miyamoto's wife, Hatsue (Youki Kudoh).The story is good. Rather Casablanca-esque. Maybe a little bit of To Kill a Mockingbird, but it works. The screenplay, too, is well written with dialogue that fits the story and Hicks's point (he served as screenwriter in addition to directing).Acting wise, Snow Falling on Cedars is fine. Just fine. Nothing outrageously bad. Nothing outrageously good. (Although Max von Sydow gives a notable performance as Nels and Yune's performance is not without its merits) Ishmael Chambers is Hawke's standard role brooding, compassionate, emotionally and physically wounded. But his performance is poor. The character deserved cold passion &#150; not just distant stares. This is a film, not a book. We have no way of knowing what is going on inside our protagonist's head. The casting of Kudoh as Hatsue might have been a mistake as well. Not that she isn't good (she's fine), but it is a notable part of the story that Hatsue and Kazuo &#150; though of Japanese heritage &#150; are *Americans*.No one can ignore the beautiful cinematography of Snow Falling on Cedars. The images of the island in winter are breathtaking. In that aspect, Snow Falling on Cedars is almost a Western in that the landscape and weather are as much a part of the story as the characters we are faced with. And from that, comes the editing. What can be said about the editing? It's safe to say that Snow Falling on Cedars would never have been released had it been created in Hollywood's Studio Era. Rather, the editors would have had their heads chopped up and their bodies impaled on pikes as warnings to all editors to come DO NOT MAKE EDITING OBVIOUS. IT DISTRACTS FROM THE STORY. In Snow Falling on Cedars, there is no way that you *cannot* notice the editing. It's &#150; everywhere. All the time. In fact, it's practically omniscient. To put it gently, Snow Falling on Cedars is just one giant montage. To put it frankly, someone got a *little* too happy when it came to editing. And by a little too happy, I mean a LOT too happy. There is not a single five minute sequence without some sort of creative editing tweak or artistic camera angle. This is Hicks's attempt to out-gloss, out-imagine Orson Welles and Citizen Kane. And it ruins the movie. The editing is just so pretentious and *there* that nothing else exists on screen.Snow Falling on Cedars had potential. But it fails miserably. The cinematography and scenery may be stunning, but the editing ruins the film. No, I take that back. It doesn't ruin the film, it drops a nice big atomic bomb on it, so that all the audience gets is an f-ed up collage of gloss better suited for a midnight avant-garde screening than a full fledged cinema. A waste of my time. Avoid at all costs.

There is very little story here. Maybe a half hour of an A&E special, or one of those PBS imports that are so self important. This is tedius tedius tedius.

The whole subplot about Japanese interment camps has nothing to do with the plot or the film.  It probably had a lot to do with the novelist's life; but in this case it makes for a subplot that is nothing but distraction.There is a wonderful eye here, at times.

A top notch cast Ethan Hawke, Max Von Sydow, Youki Kudoh, James Cromwell, Richard Jenkins, Rick Yune, Eric Thal, Sam Shephard, James Rebhorn, and Celia Weston star in SNOW FALLING ON CEDARS, a superb drama directed with sensitivity by Scott Hicks. This film offers a lot to people who love movies about people. There is war action and romance, but no macho, unrealistic steroid kings, and no blonde bimbos decorating the screen. Instead there is a secret interracial teenaged romance that takes place inside a wet cedar tree, shrouded in the misty and sopping weather of Washington state. Since they were children, Ishmael Chambers, a white boy and Hatsue Imada, a Japanese born girl, have been playmates. I found this friendship powerful. There is nothing like falling in love with someone you played with on the beach as a child. As their friendship continues over the course of years, they become young lovers, terrified that their parents will discover and put an end to their relationship. Hatsue's mother wants her to marry a Japanese man, and Ishmael's mother worries that her son is heading down the road to heartbreak, because in the aftermath of Pearl Harbor and the South Pacific events, a relationship like this is doomed.The prose of the film is graceful, as we are treated to flashbacks of the childhoods and teen years of Ishmael and Hatsue. In the present, a Japanese fisherman is accused of murdering a white fisherman of German decent. The crime drama, courtroom drama, and flashbacks of war and love all blend smoothly to tell an original and wonderful story. As well as love, prejudice and heartache, we have a twist that involves obsession. All of it ties in together.The acting is first rate. Hawke, as usual, portrays his character with soulfulness and gracefulness. He gives the adult Ishmael, a damaged but not bitter man a sense of dignity. Other standouts are Von Sydow as an aging defense attorney who has tremendous compassion, and Rebhorn as a semi-venomous prosecutor in the murder case. The cinematography is beautiful. The score by James Newton Howard can only be described by me as achingly beautiful. His music seems to breathe emotion into the scenes.I can't say enough about what a great, touching film this is!!!

To be sure, the film ambitiously strives to capture David Guterson's poetic prose through some breathtaking cinematography along with some much less impressive heavy-editing and extreme close-up composition. The overall impression, unfortunately, recalls a musical `etude' &#150; as though the director, Scott Hicks, and cinematographer, Robert Richardson, were most interested in presenting an exhaustive study in low-light visuals (even the trial takes place during brownouts and power outages) and in extreme narrative fragmentation (think Faulknerian flashbacks represented via Eisenstein or MTV montage). Narrative coherence definitely takes a back seat to visual and auditory exercise. Indeed the film was stylistically heavy-handed in just about every element of filmmaking, from its intrusively moody `Asian' soundtrack to its post-modern pastiche of images from such superior movies as To Kill A Mockingbird and Casablanca.  I found myself literally getting dizzy at several of the many junctures in the film in which the whirl of technique is overwhelming &#150; and, understand, I have a high tolerance, even a taste, for extremely formalistic filmmaking. This was too much, and simply the wrong generic/story materials for such an artistic assault. Characterization was lost. Emotion was lost.

A Japanese male is on trial whose father bought the land during the war but they got behind in payments. Romantic subplot bares no weight but director Scott Hicks does a fantastic job. This is Hicks's followup to his success with Shine. Hawke is superb as he searches for answers but his involvement with a female sidelines what's important. Sam Shepard as his father is superb and the relationship is seen as one trying to reach the other in potential or measuring up. Also with Richard Jenkins as a Sheriff who survives what might have been a cliché type role by applying intellect and reasoning. Max Von Sydow as a lawyer also rises above convention by stealing his scenes. Youki Kudoh plays the married Asian woman whom Hawke rolls about under the cedars enacting hot forbidden passion.

The picture has a 6.8 rating as I write this, a far cry from the 10 I would give it for masterful story telling and exceptional cinematography. You just never can tell.I realize that the non-linear format can be a turn off for many viewers, but unlike other movies I've seen utilizing the frequent use of flashbacks, I didn't find the technique to be distracting here. It was fully essential to develop the back story of Ishmael's (Ethan Hawke) unrequited love for Hatsue (Yuki Kudo), and the circumstances leading to the trial of Hatsue's husband for murder. Particularly relevant were the scenes pertinent to the Miyamoto family acquiring the berry farm and how they were basically swindled by Etta Heine (Celia Weston) and the legal system following the death of Mrs. Heine's husband. The roundup of Japanese families and their internment in prison camps following the outbreak of World War II was particularly painful to watch recreated on screen, alluding to an unfortunate era in the history of the country.However the most agonizing theme that pervades the story is Ishmael's inability to come to terms with the loss of Hatsue. It invades every aspect of his thoughts and his very existence. Eventually this personal torment is eclipsed by the necessity to do the right thing for a fellow human being.With a finale reminiscent of the closing scene in To Kill a Mockingbird, the Miyamoto family stands in unison to proclaim their admiration for Ishmael after he does the right thing by bringing new evidence to the judge presiding over the trial. Just prior to that, Defense Attorney Gudmundsson (Max von Sydow) delivered a stunning summation to jolt Ishmael into recognition of what he must do for the sake of justice and equality. Later, in a quiet moment with Ishmael, the wizened attorney makes a poignant observation that's brilliantly insightful into the human condition - Accident rules every corner of the universe, except maybe... the chambers of the human heart.

In Snow Falling on Cedars, a Japanese-American in the Northwest is accused of murder because a white fisherman is found dead in his fishing net not long after World War II. The setting is in the wake of racial animosity because of the internment of Japanese-Americans during World War II. The case is largely brought forth because of prejudicial attitudes prevalent at the time rather than strong evidence. (Ironically, German-Americans did not suffer the same fate as the Japanese during the same period.) The brilliance of the film, which I assume is more or less faithful to the book, is its handling of several separate but intertwined stories. At the forefront is the murder trial of Kazuo Miyamoto, a young Japanese-American in the 1950's who fought on the American side of World War II, played brilliantly understated by Rick Yune. He is accused of murdering Carl Heine, a fellow fisherman, who now has land previously owned by Japanese who were forced to give it up (as well as most of their possessions) when they were unjustly forced into interment camps on the West Coast.The other stories involve Hatsue Miyamoto (played wonderfully by Youki Kudoh) and Ishmael Chambers (Ethan Hawke in possibly his best performance since Reality Bites) as star-crossed lovers before adulthood. We learn, largely through flash-backs, that the American white boy and Japanese girl met and fell in love on the eve of Japanese-American internment. Their story parallels the later court case, and the loss of their relationship is because of the racial divides imposed by the US Government, fearing that all Japanese-Americans were suspect because of their ancestry, rather than any evidence they were actually secretly in conspiracy with the Japanese Empire. The love between Hatsue and Ishmael is told through flash-backs. Hatsue is now the wife of the accused, and Ishmael has followed in the footsteps of his father and become a reporter and journalist. We learn that Ishmael still has strong feelings for the woman who once loved him when they were but children, but he is side-lined from their lives.Like Mockingbird, Cedars is largely about the tragedy of prejudice and racism. One aspect of the story which emerges, possibly not consciously, is how the Japanese-Americans are largely similar to their white counterparts. They like much of the popular American music of the 1940's, they play games, they enjoy good food and wine. Of course, their interests in Buddhism are different, but I believe the point of the story is that the similarities between cultures are often overlooked in favor of our few differences. Although most of the focus is on the white community being wary of their Japanese neighbors, in a poignant scene, the young Hatsue is told by her good-intentioned mother that her daughter should not look at white boys, and should marry a Japanese boy. So prejudice cuts in both directions, often with tragic results. Some of the most heinous crimes in human history are perpetrated out of fear. And if someday, we could let go of our fears of the other, maybe the world would be a better place.

It does a very good job of portraying the resentment toward the Japanese after World War II, as well as the general racism against Asians in that area at that time. I was particularly impressed with the courtroom scene where a White female landowner (I suppose she saw herself as a real American) demonstrates her prejudice against foreigners, even though she herself had a strong foreign accent.I saw this film on cable when it first came to television, and now again a dozen years later. When I first saw the film I was impressed with young Ethan Hawke. I haven't been very impressed with him since.I am not a big fan of flashbacks, although they have their place. Some directors rely on them way too much, and that is evident in this film. I found it made the story a bit confusing in parts. And I had to laugh at one of our reviewers who said the story couldn't be told in sequence. Really? A story that occurs in sequence can't be told in sequence? This film has SOME flashbacks for the sake of having flashbacks.The cinematography here is excellent, and some scenes are particularly memorable. The rounding up of the Japanese in order to send them to relocation camps is a haunting sequence.As good as the round up sequence was, PARTS of the courtroom scenes were equally bad. Key testimony was quite good, but to show the blur of the trial, there were lousy slow motion scenes with muffled sounds. I was not impressed.As mentioned, Ethan Hawke was very good here as the young newspaper man struggling with idealism. James Cromwell was very good as the judge, in part because in his career you never quite knew whether he was going to be the good guy or the bad guy. Richard Jenkins is not a handsome guy, which is probably why he is so underrated as an actor; he does very nicely here as the sheriff. A highlight of the film is Max von Sydow as the defense attorney!!! And Rick Yune was appropriately stoic as the young Japanese man on trail.This is a darned good film, despite a few faults.

Ishamel loves Hatsue but due to the circumstances surrounding them, she is sent off to a holding facility in California. There, she writes a letter calling off her engagement with him, her reasons cited as she is not sure whether she truly loves him or not.Whilst there she meets a Japanese man, Kazou and falls in love with him. Meanwhile Ishamel is over fighting in the war.While he is fighting underwater, his arm is injured and has to be amputated. Ishamel blames Kastue for his amputated arm as he was thinking of her tragic letter as the fighting had occurred. When he comes back to his hometown ( now in the 1950's) he hopes to rekindle their relationship but in a tragic twist she is married to that Japanese man, Kazou. Ishamel is devastated with the loss of losing his arm and now with losing his only love. In attempt of closure, he asks her to hold him one last time, which she rejects as she is now married and has a husband. Another reason why she rejects this is that it was asked as a favor from him which leads the audience to question whether or not she really loved him, as proved by the letter which renounced their relationship and spoke of truths which indicates that Katsue had never loved him.Ishamel has now discovered evidence which can free her husband from Jail and he now has a morals dilemma of whether to submit this piece of evidence or not. He is conflicted, as he wants to not submit the evidence so that he may be with Katsue again or submit the evidence and go with his moral judgment and not be with Katsue but stay true to his principals installed within him by his once alive father.Ishamel must decide on what to do and whether to do the right thing, or to do the wrong thing and revive the possibility of getting the only thing that he has ever wanted.

It is a little quirky with the frequent flashbacks from Ismail's memory, and they lack consistency and continuity of thought. In short, the plot unfolds in a very jumpy manner. The subject matter is great, and is in the mold of To Kill a Mockingbird. People forget (or choose to ignore) the racism and severe prejudice leveled at Asians, Asian-Americans and especially Americans of Japanese decent. The courtroom scenes are terrific! People testifying on the stand that the Jap is guilty! The Prosecuter, Coroner, Sheriff and many townspeople are extremely prejudiced!! The Sheriff is also ignorant of police work. Max von Sydow is great as usual. I cried many tears when the Japanese turned to face Ismail bowing with honor and respect when his evidence caused the jury to be dismissed. That hit me hard.

The Ugandan born Australian Scott Hicks bravely took on this highly-charged story, seen in a series of flashbacks to different times zones as a court-case is carried out, because two young people had the audacity to fall in love when such love between the Japanese and other races was forbidden. Now that might sound first unbelievable, and second rather like the serving up of something in a tremendist style. Not so Scott Hicks is too intelligent to play on such superficial simplistic reactions, and carefully down-tones the telling of the story as it unfolds. Good interpretations all round, but I doff my hat for Max von Sydow, who, in this film, probably gave one of his sincerest and most convincing performances I have ever seen him in. A really beautiful interpretation from this veteran actor.Snow falling on cedars is the symbolic thread which keeps the whole film on line, as it weaves back and forth through the different time-spans.

There's a scene where Von Sydow is leaving the courtroom and sees Hawke eyeing him on the courtroom balcony. Hawke is a newspaper reporter following in his dad's footsteps. I thought the scene evoked To Kill a Mockingbird when Atticus Finch is leaving the courtroom after the closing arguments. Von Sydow could've been Finch as an older man facing one last chance to set a man free of a different race. One last case for equality. Von Sydow brings integrity and charisma to the role of attorney..a man who has one last case left in him. The closing arguments from Sydow were great and this scene should be played at his funeral once this great actor leaves us.Second comes the editting. Many critics complained about the flashbacks as being annoying and distracting. I thought the editting and flashback format of this film are seamless. I was never thrown off and was able to follow the film without distractions or problems.Third is the overall beauty..angelic and lyrical. Every shot of this film is elegant and graceful. I love films that make the location a mood in part with the picture. The snow,trees,beach,every shot from the camera whether it be of the seaman's corpse or Von Sydow's chess table..Scott Hicks brings the film a unique vicseral feel.

The use of a short, tender and unresolved theme throughout the film underscores the unresolved relationship between the reporter and his childhood love shared with the Japanese girl. The same theme could represent the unresolved nature of the entire plot until the very end of the film, when indeed, like the elements in the film, the theme is resolved.

There were so many twists and turns in the movie that for a first timer to it, would definetely make you want to know what is going on. This isn't a terribly exciting movie, but it definitely is what it is; a drama. SFOC shows the true power of love, anger, hate, and so many other emotions we all share as human beings. The historical value was very innovative for WW2 based movies, and really shed some light on the torment which happened on our side of the world, not just Germany and such like in so many other war movies about WW2. Too many are about the Holocaust and not enough are about other less discussed topics (such as this.) I constantly found myself loving then hating each individual character back and forth till I finally pieced everything together. For instance, when the Japanese were taken from the town I was saddened for the female lead character, however, when Hawke's character's....you know....(don't wanna spoil it! ) ) was....you know....I was p****d and saddened.

The only other movie I ever cried at was JACK, and that is because I felt so bad for Robin Williams's character (the scene when Lopez tells Williams she won't go with him to the dance and he holds his heart makes me ball uncontrollably).

An okay movie.SNOW FALLING ON CEDARS REVIEWWhile this movie has a good plot and some really, really great scenery, some of the scenes fail to be interesting at all. It's not a movie for someone who wants a lot of action in all their films, which I don't. While I like other movies with no action, this I don't think would be one of the better ones.Snow Falling On Cedars is about a Japanese man on trial for murder. Throughout the movie, one of the people in court, Ishmael (Hawke), relieves his past as he remembers his times with the suspects wife.This movie has some really beautiful scenery, I really enjoyed the scenes shot on the lake. The fog really gave it kind of a depressing theme, which fit with parts of the movie. But a lot of the scenes shot in court, and I suppose even some scenes shot on the lake were really not interesting. It seemed stuffy, and that really brings the movie down.The acting was pretty good though. Hawke did a good job with his character Ishmael, showing how he still really loved his 'childhood crush'. The writing was realistic too. The scenes where Ishmael was a child seemed realistic because he was still a little shy around girls, and didn't exactly know what too say all the time, and yet at the same time he also was brave enough to pursue the one he liked.Good writing, good acting, boring scenes is what this movie was pretty much was. While some scenes are boring, the acting and writing kind of makes the movie a little better. I really liked the scenery in the movie, it made the town seem really depressing though, sometimes. This might be good to watch once, maybe twice.

This lead to difficulty keeping track with the current of the trial and, as is also with the book, the ending is a little bit of an anticlimax.

However, Snow Falling on Cedars has to be admired for pulling this off so intensely.SFOC focuses on a small-time journalist (Ethan Hawke) who has been following the case of a part-time fisherman who has died in suspicious circumstances. It quickly degenerates into a murder case when it is revealed that this man recently (and controversially) bought some land locally. Why controversially? This is because this land was previously leased to a Japanese family who lost it by not keeping up with their payments. The murder attribute of the case comes from a member of this family, Kazuo Miyamoto (Rick Yune) who has publicly demonstrated his rage for the now-tenant of the land and is therefore a prime suspect. What is worse, is that his Japanese lover is Hawke's childhood sweetheart.Set against a background of war, Snow Falling on Cedars confronts issues of racial hatred sensitively and without cloying sentimentality. Rick Yune's performance is at once scary and controlled as the suspect and the appearance of Max Von Sydow as the defence attorney adds weight to the proceedings. However the real star of the piece is the stunning cinematography. Coupled with Scott Hicks' graceful direction, the movie is instantly lifted from being an above average period drama to something more profound. The only disappointment is the slightly messy screenplay. While the time changing element is initially effective, the overuse of voice-over and editing to join different time-periods together grates in the movie's second hour. Also, while we see much of Ethan's character while he is young, emphasis is taken off his older self leaving the audience (or at least me) with a sense of dissatisfaction.

I wished they had chosen some other scheme for telling the whole story.  Most trial stories really use the trial procedure to tell the story. This movie took a point in the trial and then tried to switch to the truth (to show how trials distort rather than reveal?).  I was glad to know the forces that bore down upon the community as it tried to achieve some sort of justice, I just didn't consider the final result ideal.However, I did like the ATTEMPT to tell a story about one of the great shames of our society, our caving in to fear and causing great injustices as a result.  It is an irony to me that Ishmael's father said they should behave so as to have no regrets about it afterwards. If America has any regrets, it steadfastly refuses to admit it.  So, maybe it was naive to say behavior would determine the country's emotion in the aftermath.  Honor can be pretended.The movie got nominated for cinematography in every film contest on the face of the earth, so it is probably worth seeing for the art alone.

But all of the separate stories come together remarkably in the book, and in the movie it just becomes overwhelming and choppy. However, I will give the movie some credit.

The way it captured all of the beauty and color of the San Juan islands in Washington state made me want to get up and move there right now. And I thought the actor playing Nels Gudmundssen embodied him perfectly.The bottom line is definitely to read the book before you see this movie. The whole culture of the Japanese-Americans and the hardships they endured is fascinating, and David Guterson has a great narrative style. And if you've read the book, much of the movie makes more sense. Some people I know who only saw the movie left very confused by its rushed editing.

I found the main characters to be somewhat understated, with a lack of dramatic flair, and strangely unmotivated. Except for Max von Sydow, of course, who offers by far the most satisfying performance in the film, much of the rest of the supporting cast seem to be playing almost cookie-cutter stereotypes.There's great potential in the story, but many opportunities seem to have been missed for the characters to be fleshed out - odd for such a long movie. But then again, most of the movie's length is spent in flashback limbo. This does work to move the story along, but, well, the movie sometimes gives away too much, and sometimes too little.

The cinematography reveals a demanding place to live that's rewarding for those who embrace the hardships, and it's clear that no one who chooses to live here, caucasian or asian, survives long if they try to go it alone or shirk hard work.  In that sense, the environs serve as a great equalizer that engenders the citizens with mutual respect.Against this backdrop Snow Falling on Cedars tells a story of prejudice.  There are actually several stories that reveal prejudices of different kinds expressed by several people whos lives connect in often difficult and painful ways.  Most characters develop clearly through the various stories save one, that of the suspected murderer Kazuo.Roger Ebert has noted the failure to flesh out Kazuo as a flaw in the movie while admitting that it may not have been possible to develop the courtroom drama had he been fleshed out more.  I'd add that because the film focuses on prejudice, it's crucial that Kazuo not be fleshed out not just because it serves the purposes of the courtroom drama but also because prejudice is informed by ignorance.  The viewer is meant to be ignorant regarding Kazuo in order that his/her own prejudice might be given opportunity to emerge and the lesson of the film be received more powerfully.

Why this film was forgotten by critics in a matter of weeks you've got me!  Why this film didn't win the Oscar for best cinematography I give up!  But what I do know is that after seeing `Snow Falling on Cedars' for the first time last night, I couldn't have expected it to be so intensely sweeping.  I knew it was made by Scott Hicks, the acclaimed director of `Shine.' I knew it was shot by Robert Richardson, the A-class DP who shoots most of Oliver Stone's films.  I knew that it was adapted from a best selling novel that won praise all over the world, but for some reason I had never been driven to see it.  The film is on so many levels a masterpiece. 	        One of the things that I liked most about the film was the backdrop in which it was set a small little fishing community in Washington State, set during the time period of post WWII.  This backdrop was what aided the lust cinematography and remarkable set designs.  The viewer was able to establish a clear picture of what it must have been like to live in a small little west coast marine town full of Japanese inhabitants during a racially clouded time period.  The sequence which best fulfills this, is when all of the Japanese families are taken to concentration camps.  One of the moments which tore into me was when the officers came to Hatsue's house and took all of their Japanese influenced belongings and arrested her father.  As the officers are leaving the house, one of them stops on the porch and takes down a Japanese chime.  It is truly disheartening to see their culture disappear in the blink of an eye.  The scene played out beautifully, and it most importantly summed up the Japanese position in America at that time.  One could easily make an entire film on the subject of not how the Japanese treated us during Pearl Harbor, but instead on how we treated them in our own country.           Near flawless, and full of some of the richest and purist images to have ever been put on film, Scott Hicks has crafted simply one of the best-looking films ever made.  Virtually every shot in the picture is filmed with precision and style, yet never dulling the viewers attention, not even for a moment.  I had never realized how good an eye Scott Hicks has had before.  I personally hope that his collaboration with Richardson will remain constant for years to come.  The first fifteen minutes of the film is an example of the amazing beauty which the two achieve together through the lens of the camera, as are the flashback sequences with Ethan Hawke and his lover Youki Kudoh as children.	One of the things that didn't work for me was Ethan Hawke's character.  For the first hour of the film, his character kind of hovers above the storyline as it unravels and the plot begins to thicken.  He only has about ten lines throughout the first act, and I consider this to be the film's main flaw.  Ishmael's character is supposed to be one of the central drives of the film, and it is he who is in love with the defendants wife and he who should be who the audience sympathizes with.  However the audience simply doesn't know anything about him for them to care.  His past is hardly mentioned, except for the scenes between him and Hatsue.

They show many views of them walking down the road, to show their reactions.) Filmed amazingly, with a perfect score (soundtrack music) in every scene. Yes, some of the movie could have been cut to save some time. No, this movie should not be judged on its time, but by its performances and plot.

"},{"Title":"Thoughtful And Thought Provoking","Date":"20 May 2001","Score":"","Genre":"Drama, Mystery, Romance","Review":"  This is a complicated story which took some time to begin to appeal to me. About halfway through the movie, I was ready to move on. The story seemed to have little consistency to it, as it jumped back and forth from a murder trial to flashbacks of life for Japanese Americans during World War II, and as about three different plots were being worked out. Somehow though it all does manage to come together, and the end result is a thought provoking study of racism in various forms.The events portrayed revolve around the trial of a young Japanese-American man (Kazuo Miyamoto, played by Rick Yune) accused of murdering a white fisherman. The actual trial receives surprisingly little attention until the last half hour or so of the movie, although the standout performer of the movie, in my opinion, was Max Von Sydow, playing defense attorney Nels Gudmundsson. His closing argument (although it ironically has little bearing on the outcome of the case) is performed wonderfully by Von Sydow. The main subplot involves the racism experienced by Japanese Americans during the War. To its credit, the story also does not shy away from Japanese prejudice against whites as it traces the love story of Hatsue (Youki Kudoh) and Ishmael (Ethan Hawke). Related to this is a decent performance by Hawke as a newspaperman man attempting to live up to the legacy of his father, who was a defender of Japanese Americans.You have to stick with this through what seem to be some slow moments to really appreciate the intricacy of the story, and the intelligent way it's put together. I've rated it a 6; it probably would have been higher, except that it is difficult to fight through the somewhat confusing first hour or so. Do it, though, because it really is worth it in the end.

I have no clue why, either. All the elements are in here that make a movie great, acting, writing, direction, etc. I haven't read through other comments, so I do not yet know what other people think about it, but I know that critical response was mixed and that it did not do well at theaters.What I look for most in a film is not writing or acting or even direction. Sure, if a film contains any of those three elements, it could potentially be great. I myself consider a film's mood and tone to be the single most important element, and, if a film produces a powerful mood of any sort, then that film is particularly special. Snow Falling on Cedars produces a powerful mood indeed.SPOILERSThe overall premise is intriguing in itself a white boy falls in love with a Japanese girl shortly before the bombing of Pearl Harbor (and, thus, the placement of Japanese-Americans in internment camps). During her stay at an internment camp, the girl falls in love with a Japanese man who is staying there. Meanwhile, the white boy goes to fight the Japanese in the Pacific. After the war, the Japanese man is accused of killing a local white man. Most of this film consists of the courtroom drama. I normally dislike them, finding them boring and annoying. This film does it well. I was intrigued and never bothered, even if it contained several cliches, especially where the attorneys were concerned (I do have to give credit to Max von Sydow, one of the most godly actors the cinema has ever known; he plays the defense attorney).All of this rather simple plot (what the film does have to say about racism is worthy, even if it has been done plenty of times before; we can never express the notions enough) is imbued in some of the most heavenly cinematography and music that I've ever experienced. Especially the music, for which, I believe, it was actually nominated for an Oscar, it's only nomination (unfortunately). Also, Scott Hicks shows an enormous amount of the scenes in slow motion to add to the film's melancholy and dreamlike mood. Although the plot is what most people will pay attention to, and thus they will criticize it, I assume, this film is much more successful with its style. It made me fall in love, and it captured my emotions tightly. I would compare it mostly (and favorably, of course) with the masterful The Sweet Hereafter. That is a study in grief, and this is a study in lost love. I give the film a 10/10. It will be one of those films that I will try to push onto other film enthusiasts.

"},{"Title":"Lots of parallel plots","Date":"5 January 2001","Score":"","Genre":"Drama, Mystery, Romance","Review":"  This was a very interesting movie, especially in how it artfully, intellectually, and realistically captured the mood in the United States between Americans and Japanese-Americans before, during, and after WW2.  There were three main concurrent, related plots.  I'll try to summarize them without giving away too much.Plot #1  This was the current plot (early 50's), but was actually the most insignificant.  It was about a mysterious death of a local well-known and well-liked fisherman who was alone on his own boat.  A local Japanese-American fisherman (Kazuo Miyamoto played by Rick Yune), who was the last to see him alive, is charged and tried for the murder.  Miyamoto's father had made payments over several years to purchase 7 acres of land for his family from a local farmer.  But the farmer eventually dies during the payments, and the anti-Asian wife sells the land to the fisherman.  When Kazuo comes home from the war (European theater), he wants to buy the land from the fisherman, as his father had tried to do.  But at this point, the land will cost him a lot more than his father was supposed to pay.  So Kazuo really has it in for the fisherman and admits that he wanted to kill him.  The trial lasts throughout the movie.  Kazuo is married to Hatsue Miyamoto (Youki Kudoh), who, years ago, had a secret love affair with a local white newspaper reporter, Ishmael Chambers (Ethan Hawke).Plot #2  Early 40's.  This story follows the secret love affair of teenagers Ishmael Chambers, white, and Hatsue Imada, Japanese.  Both of them know their relationship will be condemned by family and neighbors, so they only meet in private, mostly on the beach and in the woods.  Her mother, especially, has warned her to stay away from non-Japanese boys and constantly tells her she should only marry a Japanese man.Plot #3.  The Imada family is subjected to mild, local racist attitudes, stemming from the recent Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor.  The father is arrested for illegally owning a gun and explosives and is taken to a concentration camp.  The officials also remove all Japanese artifacts from the home.  Later, the entire family his taken to a camp, where they will spend the rest of the war.  It is at this time when the love affair from plot #2 is forced to brake up as it is years until the two see each other again.The movie/book is set up to follow plot #1 as the current theme.  But the characters have flashbacks which tell the other stories.  The book is probably excellent, but the movie falls a little short in explaining the different stories concurrently.  Some of the scenes are very difficult to understand.  The acting and scenery were superb, and the movie is worth watching for the acting and story alone.  The movie itself leaves a lot to be desired.I gave it 7/10 overall.  The acting gets a 10, as does the writing.  This is Ethan Hawke's best performance of his career, and he deserves a best actor nomination for this.  Youki Kudoh also deserves a nomination for best actress or best supporting actress.  David Guterson deserves an award for his writing effort.  I only wish they had made a better attempt at adapting the book to the big screen.

The cinematography is effectively moody and unconventional. There are some outstanding performances, notably that of Jan Rubes as the crotchety but brilliant defence lawyer.

You see, the former universally prisoners remember looking up at Manzanar's guard tower. All the oral history interviews of Manzanar focus on the guard tower as the locus of their memories, shattered trust and oppression. To only show the view from inside the guard tower was a big mistake of the director - - it's like doing a movie about the Japanese experience in Hiroshima then showing the bomb from the pilot's vantage point where you see the mushroom cloud (instead of just a blinding light). You see, in both instances that's not the experience of the Japanese victim, that imagery is the experience of the Anglo oppressor. So by choosing to shoot the scene from the guard tower, the director failed the audience at a critical point.

Perhaps it requires of some critics a bit more empathy concerning the subject matter. Discount the comments by a teen who obviously would only view The Longest Day only for its action and explosive war effects. The film lacked the sublety of MTV's fast paced camera work.  I was born in the Tanforan racetrack, once located across Hwy l0l from the present day San Francisco International airport and spent my first three years of life in one of the ten concentration camps (relocation camp was a euphanism comparable to calling the Holocaust a BBQ) in l942 and suffered the consequences of an being an outcast when my family returned to California from Topaz, Utah. I endured the verbal and physical abuse of other children for merely looking like the former enemy. Though it didn't occur to me at the time between beatings and spittings that they had lost fathers, uncles, brothers and friends in the war and I only represented the cause of their personal losses. Nevertheless, to this day my soul is still scarred deep within and I outwardly cringe when I hear the word Jap, though I was born and raised an American and had nothing to do with the wartime actions of Japan. My sister (born in Topaz)and I held hands during our not quite dispassionate viewing of the film. Her husband, a former Navy Seal from Arkansas was also emotionally touched. The film aptly conveyed the racism and heartaches associated with what were our Days of Infamy. Perhaps if I could distance myself from the film as some reviewers can, my opinion might differ. But I rate it at least a B+ to A-. Incidentally, the scene of a Happa girl (half white...it only took one sixteenth Japanese blood to qualify as an internee) was borrowed from my dad's 8mm home movies taken surreptitiously at Topaz, not Manzanar camp, and which is the only other home movie inducted into the Library of Congress' National Film Archives.

Courtroom movie?  A town divided along racial lines?  A love story?

Great Expectations was also magnificently lit and edited but at least the filmmakers stopped to tell a story along the way.The cast is completely wasted.  While injustices to Japanese Americans circa 1941 has weight the movie pays that subject lip service.  Scott Hicks is clearly in love with his camera moves and flashbacks here.  He could have used some subtlety and left the camera still long enough for the actors to try to do the story some justice.I felt Shine was one of the most over-rated independent films of the '90s.

In Stanley Kubrick's masterpiece, there was few dialogue and many jaw-dropping images, specially in the last 20 minutes. Now Snow Falling on Cedars can be added to this group. The dialogue is almost always present, but it is so wonderfully filmed that sometimes words are not needed to express feelings. The big, neverending forest. The young lovers running on the sand. A dead fish. The war. The snow.The story of the film would be bland and conventional if told in the chronological way. But director Scott Hicks, the same of the equally wonderful Shine, builds his film as a mosaic of emotions. It starts in 1950, showing the death of a white fisherman on the Pacific coast. All the evidences takes to a Japanese man of the community, named Kazuo Myiamoto. He is taken to trial. The story belongs to Ishmael Chambers, a young reporter who is covering the case. The situation indirectly involves him, because he had a forbidden affair with the accused's wife, Hatsue, when they were younger. She was the only love of his life, and this strong feeling takes him back to his past memories, in wonderful, magic flashbacks. Their affair was finished because of the war and other problems, but I won't tell you much more. The whole film is a magic box of surprises. The characters are all very well developed, from the main to the supporting ones (as the fisherman's widow).But the merits of Scott Hick's picture don't stop there. The story is complex, intriguing, beautiful, bittersweet. It's like an engrossing book you are reading you just can't stop till the end. I haven't read the novel which gave base to the screenplay, but I'm sure the writers did a great job. They could capture the prejudice in a small community of Japanese and white people, a forbidden love which may or may not still exist, the cruelties of war, the power of snow. The most interesting line is said by Max Von Sydow's character, the defense lawyer, something like sometimes, a small place goes to trial. In my opinion, this is the most important message the film has to pass.The acting here is not perfect, but very efficient. Ethan Hawke is good as Ishmael, in his best role since Gattaca. Youki Kudoh has an interesting performance, and Max Von Sydow is great as always, but unfortunately his character is too small. However, the cinematography is an apart show. It could have been easily awarded at the Oscar, because it's so stunning, so wonderful, a joy to our eyes.Despite the quite conventional conclusion to the trial, Snow Falling on Cedars is a small jewel that should be appreciated not just as a gorgeous film, but also as a complex, deep one. Highly recommended.

I disagree, it's not like they could cut out stuff....  Obviously people who said that did not read the book, the book was pretty long, they cut out a few scenes already, they couldn't cut out anymore otherwise it would have to be Snow falling on.....Anyways, my opinion is that this movie was magnificent, I really felt for Ishmael, they drew me into the character and I have to admit I shed a tear or two at the end..  Ethan Hawke is a great actor and pretty hot too!!!!!!!!!  He grasped the role of Ishmael superbly.Also the cinematography was fabulous!!!!!  I was thinking throughout the whole thing oh my god, look at that camera work when I usually would have been thinking oh my god look at how hot Ethan Hawke is!  A film that can draw my attention away from Ethan Hawke and onto the cinematography deserves an oscar and I wasn't surprised when it got nominated and I thought it should have won but it didn't... I thought that they could have found a better actress to play Hatsue though. Yuki Kudoh was ok, but she could have been a whole lot better, and I didn't really get the sense that they hired her for her acting ability but more so, for her publicity (she's a famous singer/ actress in Japan).So here's a quick Summary.

There are many flashbacks - in fact, the director seemed to be completely in love with flashbacks, which made the movie sometimes confusing. Too, some of the main questions of this movie get never answered. Why has the woman married a different man when she has loved the first one ? All those reasons she gave are emotional bull***t. But the story didn't matter much because it was so conservative and foreseeable. So the movie became very impressive and therefore also a little entertaining. Too, some of the statements in this movie had something to tell to me, especially those sayings of the defence counsel.Movies about sad love always have a big bonus for me. However, I don't consider this a big thing of a movie. Its too much styled in a please-gimmy-oscars way. I also didn't liked the silent acting of Ethan Hawke here, even if it was without any question perfect. But he doesn't show that he was wading through hell, experiencing that it has no ground. He doesn't show that he was in a situation where many escape through suicide, or start to drink. He stays in the first state of sad love through the whole movie even after so many years...I think this is a good movie for older people. Again, it had something to tell to me, and I wouldn't be surprised if it gets oscars. But I don't consider it genial. It is just good dialogues and a nice outfit.

When Fleetwood Mac were asked by Warner Brothers to make the follow-up to the ultra -successful 'Rumours' - Lindsey denied them 'Rumours II'. While 'Tusk' was not a commercial success - retrospectively it is being hailed as a masterpiece. Your time will come with this film Scott.Hicks has created a cinematic tour de force with 'Snow Falling on Cedars'. Offering a non-linear narrative with multiple flashback, the viewer must watch attentively to schematize the action within the plot. In many ways, 'Snow' echoes the work of the mighty Ozu Yasujiro - a Japanese director who demanded excellence per frame subordinated to plot linearity. Similarly, Ishmael's (Ethan Hawke) movement and non-emotive expression could be seen as a variant of Ozu's characters.Love and desire is overwhelmingly present within the film but never overt and and existing on the surface. The device allows it to become lyrical through beautiful images accompanied with a spell-binding hybrid score from James Newton Howard.I would counter any arguments that find Hatsue (Youki Kudoh) cold and unfeeling. Japanese culture and behaviour need to be understood here - without a Western sense of romance being imposed upon the film. This is World War II Japanese behaviour  folks - not post WWII.Again, I would counter any arguments that Ishmael lacks emotive depth. I think he has yet to live - always murdering his future because his past is not dead.At the same time - and also needing to be in context is the interracial relationship. Hatsue and Ishmael's love finds solace in discretion and hideaway spaces.If love and truth (the murder trial) underlies the construct of this film's thematic concern - then so is the idea of letting go of the past. It's not as simple as Ishmael getting over Hatsue - it's also Ishmael's transcedence of  his father's eclipsing shadow. This is finally realized at the point of closure when Hatsue's family bow to Ishmael in court - an acknowledgement of appreciation. Later - Hatsue tells Ishmael that he is just like his Father. Funny that. Ozu loved the whole father/daughter, father/son thing as well. Bravo Scott Hicks!

He's clearly intended his film to be a feast for the eyes, and for the most part, he succeeds.  In today's rigidly narrative cinema, it's a genuine pleasure to find the sort of free-form expressionist sequence Hicks uses to embody the dual trauma faced by a character in losing his arm and getting dumped by his girlfriend.  However, the film is plagued by the same flaws that kept me from enjoying the book, namely glacial pacing and unnecessary emphasis on the childhood foundations of his characters' motivations.These flaws are compensated by several fine performances.  At the film's center, like an oak among saplings, is Max von Sydow.  He does nothing to dispel my long-standing belief that good money is never wasted on one of his performances.  I hate to say stuff like this, but Snow Falling on Cedars is worth seeing for him alone -- he's in his 70s now, and you have to wonder how much longer we'll be able to enjoy this giant walking the earthSnow Falling on Cedars is also commendable for reminding us of the moral abhorrence of the Japanese-American internment camps.

The film, taken from a novel by David Guterson, succeeds in educating us to a painful and sad chapter in American history when racial prejudice and animosity toward Japanese-Americans climaxed as a direct result of the sneak attack on Pearl Harbor and the lingering hatred that remained in many Americans.  Snow Falling on Cedars  succeeds, due to superlative acting, in giving us a bittersweet love story set against societal prohibitions and a subsequent murder trial that challenged the strength of that love.  The film fails in two areas - the plot is built on shaky premises that make it seem incredulous at times; and Hicks has chosen a velvet touch while his material would have benefited from a more brutal approach.  There are victims everywhere, from Ishmael to Hatsue to Kabuo to all the Japanese who were interned, but precious few villains save for the prosecutor and the crafty landowner's wife who didn't mind making a profit.  The presiding trial judge seems too kindly for such a community, especially at the end when too many contrived things fit into place.  Even the cruel scene, involving Japanese families marching down the main street, leaving their homes, as white onlookers watched, is strangely acted with more solemnity than humiliation.  The relationship between Ishmael and Hatuse seemed to be set in isolation, especially as we see them in frequent and ultimately annoying flashbacks, even though it would seem obvious that it could not be hidden in such a small community.  That Kabuo grew up in the community and yet never had any conversation with Ishmael is also disturbing.  It is the one area that could have collapsed the story if anyone bothered to ask.  And yet Snow Falling on Cedars is filmed with such conviction and its message so overwhelming that any and all slights seem trivial.  With wonderful portrayals by Ethan Hawke, Sam Shephard, Youki Kudoh, James Redborn, and Max Von Sydow, the story of a 'small trial in a small place' will not soon leave your memory.

I was spellbound from the first shot, when the hint of flickering light in the blue mist is oh-so-gradually revealed as the lamp swinging in a boat lost on the sea. The movie is like a long elegiac sigh, with images of water permeating through the fabric of the story from beginning to the end. We see the raindrops falling on the dark blue sea, snow covering the courthouse roof where the trial occurs, and we see our young lovers embrace in untutored passion, with their rain-soaked bodies in shadow, and their breath mingling within the cedar tree. All this is photographed so exquisitely that just gazing at the screen could make you weep with the sheer beauty of the landscape.On this background, Hicks tells a story of betrayal and forgiveness. At the heart of the movie is a death that might have been caused by a man, an outsider enraged by the betrayal of a promise. Surrounding it is the larger betrayal of the Japanese Americans by their friends and neighbors during WWII, when they were herded into a camp for having the wrong-colored skin.   Perhaps deliberately, the haunting image of the Japanese-Americans in their flight uncannily resembles the often-filmed image of the Jews in Nazi-Europe in the earlier part of the war.   Above all, there is a story of a personal betrayal, a betrayal of love by a Japanese girl who caved in to the pressure of her family who couldn't abide her feelings for a white boy.  All this is inextricably bound together, and the beauty of the story lies in the way an act of personal forgiveness leads to the partial redemption of a larger wrong.  In a lovely, understated performance, Ethan Hawk quietly embodies the inner torments of Ishmael, the boy who grew up to be a man so full of bitterness and regret, that he contemplates punishing his old love with an act morally reprehensible yet emotionally understandable.  Youki Kudoh is equally strong as Hatsue whose fragile beauty belies the inner core of strength. The best acting chops, however, come from Max von Sydow, whose turn as the defense lawyer is rich with wit, quiet passion and integrity. His closing statement is one of the most moving courtroom scenes I've ever seen. Hicks takes a difficult stand here in telling a potentially sensational story measure by slow measure, using images and sound more than dialogue.  It demands patience and deeper emotional involvement from the viewer, but the reward at the end is ample indeed.

The use of a German-American family's dislike of a Japanese-Americans was particularly potent.  Would we have been placing German-Americans in concentration camps had they have had non-Anglo looks? Probably.  But yet they, like many other Americans, forgot the freedoms that brought them to this land in the first place.

The film shows the people who simply gawked and shrugged as their neighbors departed, and contrasts them with the the few courageous individuals who spoke out against the grave injustice, shoook their hands, and said good-bye.

The drizzle of rain and snow saturates the movie, and because it tugs at your heart, some of the rain may end up in your hanky. My advice Ignore the critics, and judge for yourself.

I fear that Snow Fallings on Cedars will be such a film.  The cinematography is simply stunning, the screenplay draws on the narrative strengths of film--montage and arresting visual images--and the acting is understated in such a way that magnifies rather than diminishes the emotional power of its subject matter.  And yet the combined force of so many excellent and well-made movies and critical ambivalence will certainly prevent many people from seeing and appreciated this intricately woven film.A common misconception I've read in the reviews that have panned Snow Falling in Cedars is that the film is, in the words of Newsweek, a potboiler screaming to get out.  Nothing could be further from the truth, as the central motivation for the film isn't just a courtroom thriller.  True, the centerpiece of the novel is a murder trial, but in the novel the trial was a set piece designed to showcase many broader issues culture clashes, racism, and the how cultural misperceptions lead from small misunderstandings to the brink of miscarriages of justice. In fact, to make this film a potboiler would be missing the whole point, which I think many reviewer have.Director Scott Hicks made the correct, though commercially less viable choice, of centering Snow Falling on Cedars on the impressions, memories, and regrets of all who come together in the courtroom.  Hence the very visual, impressionistic style.  One need not haul out a host of horrific images of the Japanese internment to capture exactly how unjust and morally indefensible it was.  Hicks simply evokes shades of Schindler's List in the way the Japanese residents are rounded up, tagged, and unceremoniously carted off in US military trucks, while in the foreground waves a 48-starred American flag. The image is at once simple and powerful.The film's narrative style weighs heavily on this kind of storytelling.  True, it may not make immediate sense, but as the film progresses the images begin to layer upon themselves and begin to reveal their fragility and beauty.  The acting from all quarters, especially Ethan Hawke (who has spent so many movies in goateed slacker mode), is understated and judicious.  There are no histrionics, no scenery-chewing bits that have Oscar moment flashing all over them.  And to witness Max Von Sydow's masterfully underplayed defense summation is to experience the rare instance where you truly see a fine actor steeled in his craft.Find the time to see this film and you will find yourself rewarded with an impressionistic, quietly invoked film written in the language that cinema was meant to speak.

Add the gorgeous scenery of the Pacific Northwest and several established actors and you have the ingredients for a great film. It's unfortunate that the story gets buried by overbearing attempts to be clever.The producers obviously couldn't decide what kind of movie they wanted one that emphasizes the characters and the story, or an avant garde film piece. They opted for both and lose everything in the process. The haphazard editing is distracting and annoying -flashbacks and live shots appear to have been spliced together at random, chosen for their content, rather than their relevance.   In addition I found myself struggling to understand the repetition of several images, most notably the red cod (I believe that's what it was) which filled the screen four times. Perhaps it is intended to be symbolic of the evanescence of beauty and life, but I don't need to be repeatedly clubbed over the head with it.I was looking forward to discussing the film with an acquaintance that had a bit part.

I also lived as an adult in the same place as the book's author. I mention this because of the reliable and accurate sense of place, vibe, and tone the book sets, and the movie kind of gets at. Like all movies that I have seen where the producers chose to shoot film in Canada and pass it off as America-- much of the richness and detail of the book, and actual Washington state, is missing. Not to knock Canada-- it's a beautiful place with some really great folks. But it ain't the U.S., and it diminishes both countries to try and pass it off as another place. Canada might or might not be better, more rugged, more beautiful than Washington-- hey, it's grand! But as the audience, we all know the reason the film crew went there was to shave a few pennies off the location budget. That makes it kind of like the old 1970's Kung Fu TV series, where they tried to have a good old white actor play an Asian. Remember that? The star's actual resemblance to an Asian man was so non-existent, I watched it for a year before I realized that they actually expected us to believe that David Carradine (Sp?) was Chinese.Otherwise-- I would advise folks to read the book first. It is wonderful -- albeit a tad slow -- and very rich and engaging. The movie's plot was a lot easier to follow knowing the book first.I gave this adaptation an 8.

The theater was packed, but then again, it was only showing on one screen.  The movie started out eerily.  I don't know how to explain it, but for someone who may not be into slow and mysterious introductions, this is NOT the movie for you.  The story will keep you thinking and FEELING throughout the movie, but the beginning will probably wig out the impatient viewers (the guy next to me left after only 10 minutes).I have heard about the success of the book, but I had really no clue what the story was about.  The cinematography was breath-taking, the visuals as intricate and beautifully woven together as tapestry...  I just can't enough nice things about how GOOD this movie visually was.My only criticism of the movie is THIS there were moments when I really didn't like the main female character.  I think the actress who portrayed her had a very difficult task.  To play an Asian woman is ALWAYS dangerous grounds because you will be heavily critiqued by those of Asian decent, especially those in America.  I commend the actress for her good effort, but there were moments when I did not feel very compassionate simply because I didn't think she created the vulnerability the character ought to have had. Also, for those of you who like to read other people's comments on movies, DO NOT read the official web sites' messages some of them are good but most of them get into the rut of the racial tension in the movie as well as in American society.  Go see the movie because it is a BEAUTIFUL movie about a tragic, forbidden love that will never prevail or be redeemed (that's my opinion, at least), and THEN go read the best-seller book.

The flasbacks at times were oddly done, but still visually haunting especially those of Ishmael flashing back to his war experiences.

It has adapted a literary masterpiece into a film masterpiece without in any way being unfaithful to the novel. I was overwhelmed by the aesthetic and emotional experience, and was surprised, when the film came to an end, that it had lasted for well over two hours. It is a film with a very strong moral dimension, as it explores the themes of coming-of-age, fairness, justice, prejudice, compassion and obsession. (My wife's first comment as we left the cinema was 'It was like To Kill a Mocking Bird', and the point seemed very apposite). All of these themes are harmoniously married together inside the dramatic and captivating mystery  story which forms the plot, and they are all resolved at the end in a satisfying conclusion and a release of the emotion which, until then, was held superbly in control. The pattern of visual symbols in the film would be well worth exploring in a second and subsequent viewings. Some things were immediately noticeable, such as the fact that Ishmael's (Ethan Hawke) view of life is illustrated in sombre and dark colours, except in those scenes where colour and light emanate from his beloved Hatsue (Youki Kudoh). I liked all the performances in this film, and in particular, that of the lawyer defending Kazuo(Rick Yune), played by Max von Sydow. It is that character who perhaps best of all summarizes the basic theme of the film 'The entire universe is governed by accidents, except perhaps for the remote chambers of the human heart.'

In this small farming and fishing community, the tension between the races existed long before the war and is still felt deeply. It permeates every aspect of the film, as does the depth of emotion and history between these two lovers. However, ultimately this not a movie about a romance or about a murder investigation. It is a commentary on prejudice, true love and the integrity of the human heart.This movie was made not by the actors, but the great artistry of the technical crew - from the cinematography to the editing. This is an utterly beautiful and poignant movie with very little dialogue and long montages of present and past, presented layer on layer - shape upon form, as they cross and unite time and place. The story unfolds bit by bit before our eyes, as the events of many decades blend and shift. Images abound and haunt the viewer bodies making love through frosted glass, Japanese-Americans being shipped off to concentration camps tagged like cargo, forms floating in the water, and families bowing in honor.  The entire film was perfect as a painting by your favorite master. I was told by other moviegoers at the sneak preview that the film was unusually true to the award-winning book and carries the same depth of sensual experience. I can only image from that how beautifully descriptive the book must be and am considering buying it as well.If you are looking for car chases and fast action, you may well be incredibly bored.

I loved the novel and I had read it many times.  What I saw was a well-made, thoughtful, innovative adaptation of a book that had many many themes and layers.  If I had to praise just one thing in this film, I would say it had to be the lack of dialogue.  The film relies on visual associations; objects are imbued with meaning - characters say more through the objects and settings they are near that with long speeches.  Light is used symbolically - we are shown many scenes at night, characters are lit by lamps or by wildly swinging electric lights and lights are turned off or go out when we want to see more.  Hicks is hinting at the murky nature of truth and memory - we get snatches of past lives, briefly glimpsed - the editing breaking up, in a jagged fashion, the non-linear narrative.  This is a slow movie; the viewer will have to work, and work hard for the rewards that Hicks pays out if you stay with it. There are subtle, intelligent performances and, often, it what is not said that says so much.  I loved what the story has to say - that, often, one has to let go of the past and move on; life is not perfect and there is often a subtle beauty in the imperfection within a human heart.  The cinematography is exemplary and sublime - lots of cutaway shots to symbolic images (get out your Jungian glossary and enjoy) and a particularly poignant scene in which the Japanese are deported (the American shame is conveyed very effectively).  The courtroom scenes are cut and layered (lots of Altman overlapping dialogue) and given less time than in the novel.  All of this works beautifully to make a rewarding movie experience.

His imagery is the visual equivalent of poetry. The story is set during and after the Second World War in the state of Washington. Ishmael Chambers (Ethan Hawke) is the son of the local newspaper owner, Arthur (Sam Shepard). He has returned to his hometown after the war and finds that a fisherman, Carl Heine (Eric Thal), has been found dead, mysteriously  entwined in the netting of his fishing boat. A local farmer, Kazuo Miyamoto (Rick Yune) is arrested for his murder. Kazuo has been trying to buy some land from Carl. Kazuo's wife, Hatsue (Youki Kudoh) had a youthful romance with Ishmael many years before the war. It is through Ishmael's eyes that the murder trial is revealed along with flashbacks to the romance and the imprisonment of Hatsue's family in the concentration camps filled with Japanese citizens after the attack on Pearl Harbor. Simple plot descriptions can only give one an inkling of how Hicks has created his film. He moves back and forth in time fluidly and in the mind of Ishmael so that the rustic setting and wintry imagery become characters themselves in the telling of this tale. His superb use of widescreen cinematography is especially effective in giving his story an epic sweep without overwhelming the intimacy of the characters' relationships. If one had to complain about something it might be the sheer abundance of scenes showing his impressionistic scenes of the weather.  The actors are uniformly excellent. Max von Sydow portrays the lawyer defending Kazuo in another award worthy performance.  Youki Kudoh must be singled out for her fine rendering of a woman who endures the pain of an impossible romance and having her whole family uprooted from their home just as the future seemed to be filled with hope and optimism. It's a pleasure to see a film which has such a fine balance of character, story-telling, visuals and social relevance (without being preachy). It's surely one the best films of 1999.

It pretended to say a lot about race relations, but really was pretty shallow about that, too (unless it's a revelation to you that Japanese-Americans were ill-treated during WWII). Ethan Hawke's character mopes around morosely, unable to let go of a teenage love affair that ended at least eight years before. About halfway through, you'll be screaming, Get on with it, already. I'll have to assume the book is a lot better, since the movie is completely uninteresting.

There's no lack of drama, and, rare for American films, there's moral content aplenty.  All the more shame that a movie that contains not only those elements but some of the most beautiful images I've ever seen on a screen, ultimately falls flat because of self-indulgent, confusing, and downright silly artistic overflow.  I voted 7 but dearly wish I could give this film a ten because after all it does take either guts or considerable financial risk-taking to make an American film that requires its audience actually to think, and to think about serious matters of life, death, and human relationships and responsibilities.  I wholeheartedly commend the backers of this film for taking that big risk, and I just as wholeheartedly regret the missed opportunities in the final product.-----WARNING (minor, early-plot) SPOILER FOLLOWS-----------------------It was interesting to watch the scene in which the sheriff has to carry out the painful task of delivering the death message to Mrs. Heine.  It's virtually a replay, and obviously a homage, to the scene in Ingmar Bergman's Winter Light (1963) in which the pastor (played by Gunnar Björnstrand) must drive to the home of Max von Sydow's character to tell his widow of his suicide.  The very next scene in Snow Falling on Cedars takes place in the courtroom -- with Max von Sydow in a sterling performance as the defense attorney.  I found this reference touching and beautiful.

Furthermore, and in collusion with the above statements, far too many liberties were taken with the novel to fairly call this a translation of the original. It merely preserves the strongest theme of novel - racism - and runs over the rest.

The novel on which this book is based is magnificent--its like a piece of artwork come alive through words. I wasn't sure how this would be shown on film but when I saw the movie I was blown away. Just like in the novel, characters are furthered and developed through their memories which interject the present. These flashbacks are clues and hints that are fed to the audience bit by bit to allow the actual plot to unravel. Reading the book may help with the understanding of some plot points but is definitely not necessary, although highly recommended.The performances in this film are unbelievable, especially Ethan Hawke who steals the show with his portrayal of Ishmael Chambers, a local reporter who is torn between love and doing the right thing. The images are breath-takingly stunning and are accompanied by the beautiful musical score of James Newton Howard, capturing the poignancy of each scene.Please disregard the low IMDb rating for this film and go watch it right now!!! I'm begging you to give it a chance! This is one of the BEST films I have ever seen and the first film that has made me cry so much. Even after I finished watching the film, its message still moved and gripped my heart although people cannot stop things like a war or a snow storm which are inevitable and ruled by chance, they can however perform individual acts of kindness which can obliterate the world from hate, prejudice, and racism, things that are not prone to chance or circumstance.

Carl Heine, a local fisherman, has been found dead, drowned and tangled in the net of his own boat. A member of the Japanese community on the island, Kabuo Miyamoto, who was known to hold a grudge against the family of the deceased, is accused of the murder, and several pieces of evidence point to his guilt. Covering the trial for the local newspaper is young Ishmael Chambers, who was once romantically involved with Kabuo's wife, Hatsue. As the trial progresses, Ishmael comes across some very important information concerning Carl's death, but because he still has strong feelings for Hatsue, Ishmael hesitates to come forward with his findings &#150; knowing that if Kabuo is convicted, there will be a possibility of rekindling the old flame between himself and Hatsue.This adaption of the highly successful novel by David Guterson is a good movie, but not a great one. The strongest feature of this film is its cinematography - showing an amazing scenery which really captures the spirit of the small island community and the cold and harsh (but still beautiful) winter landscape. The actors are mainly solid, especially Max von Sydow and James Rebhorn as the two opposing attorneys; but both Ethan Hawke and Youki Kudoh (as the adult Ishmael and Hatsue) come across as rather flat. In fact, it's the young Ishmael and Hatsue which manages to touch the audience and give us a real sense of the love between them.The movie tries to recapture some of the spirit from the book by using a lot of artsy effects (such as echoing voices mixing into each other). Generally, this works well, but it's being used a little too often. I think the movie puts more emphasis on the wrongful treatment of Japanese-Americans than the book did, while the love story has been pushed somewhat in the background. Snow Falling... tries to be a lot of things - a courtroom drama, a historical documentary, a love story - in the book, these aspects are all mixed extremely well together, but the film fails to do the same thing (maybe because there simply wouldn't be enough time - the movie would have to be nearly twice as long). Still, it's a beautiful piece of motion picture, and well worth seeing. I'll rate it a 4 out of 6 on my dice.

This film should be viewed by every cinematography student, with the objective being how not to make a film.  It is frustrating and hard to follow the story because of so many timelines and flashbacks.  The camera work suffers from too much zooming in on the prosecuting attorney, and too many shadows and gray colors.  Do these describe the main scene of the movie, even allowing artistic license?  The music was the wrong type for the themes.  It reminded me of films about the holocaust in Europe, which was an event that was at least two orders of magnitude different from that of the maltreatment of Americans of Japanese origin before and during WWII.  There were too many themes the maltreatment described before, war in the Korean setting (which doesn't contribute much to the film), nature (with too many cuts into snow falling on the cedars), and personal relationships.  The main theme, the maltreatment of Americans of Japanese origin, is too important to have the distractions of the irrelevant war scenes.  Generally, the acting is good, but it can't save the disastrous directing.  That is, except for one who acted as if he had one foot in the grave; that actor should retire from a distinguished career.

The man on trial for the possible murder of this local man happens to be of Japanese descent. The story is shown in the eyes of a local reporter played by Ethan Hawke who's past reveals a relationship with the defendant's wife which is used as an extra storyline to explore the racism against Japanese descendants in the United States in the early 50's shortly after World War II ends. The internment camps that the Japanese were forced into by the Americans is explored for the first time in the movies here as well. This blackmark on American history is finally revealed and it is evident that this is part of the purpose of the filmmakers in this movie that could have been a simple trial-based murder mystery. It is obvious though that director Scott Hicks wanted to make this as complex as possible which lends to some of it's flaws. That complexity is explored visually for the most part with very little dialogue which is confusing to follow at times. Also, throw in a story of closure needed between Hawke's character and his former fling and you've got what could be a real mess.

Then something happens in the flashback requiring a further flashback to Ishmael's childhood.  Then we're in another flashback.  Then we're in the courtroom again.

They were once lovers, she broke off with him ... now before someone in the audience dies of frustration, would you PLEASE get back to the trial...?'One might think, at first, that Hicks has got carried away with his desire to show us beautiful images - and they ARE beautiful, so beautiful that even the pointless, rapid-fire editing can't spoil the pleasure we take in them, which is saying a lot, believe me.  But I don't think we should blame the images for the mess the narrative is in.  Hicks could have kept every single one of his striking shots and made them part of a much better film - at least in principle.  (One image he should have dropped, though, was that of Japanese-Americans being rounded up and sent to internment camps - all beneath a waving US flag.

It really is impossible to go too far wrong with courtroom drama, especially when Max Von Sydow is playing one of the lawyers.

Based on a well-told and thought-provoking best-seller, this filmbravely stuck to the book's non-linear plot line.  The lushcinematography and demanding editing -- both of which are vital tokeeping the audience following the non-chronological narrative --are highly praiseworthy.  However, what ultimately killed this moviefor me was its wrong-headed casting.  In part, Snow Falling on Cedars seeks to shed light on a darkcorner of U.S. history the unconstitutional internment of 120,000Americans of Japanese ancestry into prison camps during WorldWar II.  What led to this internment?  It was the raciallydiscriminatory assumption that American citizens of Japaneseancestry (and Asian ancestry in general) aren't really Americansbecause of their racial features.  In other words, if you're an AsianAmerican, you aren't a real American.  By throwing a critical eyeonto this disreputable episode of American history, Snow Fallingon Cedars could have helped to debunk this myth.  Instead, themovie helped to reaffirm it.  Snow Falling on Cedars features the first Asian American femalelead to appear in a major Hollywood movie since The Joy LuckClub (1993).  The character of Hatsue is born in Washingtonstate, grows up there, and goes to school there.  The role wouldhave been a God-send to any of the dozens of Asian Americanactresses who are so undeservedly underutilized by Hollywood. But how did Snow Falling on Cedars cast the role?  It broughtover Youki Kudoh -- a Japanese actress who already has aflourishing career in Japan -- tried to teach her to speak with anAmerican accent, and cast HER as Hatsue.  Although she makesa valiant effort to fake an American accent, Kudoh speaks her lineswith an accent that's noticeably Japanese.  What's wrong with this picture?  If the character had been white,would Scott Hicks have cast the part with an actress who spokewith a European accent?  Not bloody likely.  The audience wouldhave probably been saying to itself The character is born in theU.S., grows up in the U.S., and goes to school in the U.S.  Why isshe speaking with a European accent?  However, if the characteris a U.S.-born Asian, that character is expected to speak with aforeign accent.  In reality, the overwhelming majority of U.S.-bornAsian Americans speak with American accents just like any otherAmerican.  By casting a Japanese-accented actress as an Asian American,Snow Falling on Cedars (inadvertently?) drives home the verymisperception that the story originally set out to correct thatAmerican citizens of Asian ancestry are really foreigners.  This isespecially infuriating because there are so many Asian Americanactresses out there who speak with ready-made Americanaccents and who could have played the role of Hatsue as theAmerican character that she was meant to be.  As is so often thecase, Hollywood had a golden opportunity to increase  understanding about Asian Americans, and -- true to form --Hollywood blew it.  Despite the film's many positive aspects(challenging story, camerawork, editing), I can't get past SnowFalling on Cedars' egregious miscasting of Youki Kudoh.

I had read and liked aspects of the book. But what a piece of overworked crap the film has turned out to be!  Cedars apes the form of the European art movie lots of beautiful tracking shots, soft lighting, precious landscapes, and long lingering closeups of emotionally pained actors -  all of which (in this film) add up to exactly zero.  There is nothing original or genuine here.  Everything is mannered. With the exception perhaps of the strategically cast Max Von Sydow, everything here is a waste.  Cedars is nothing more than an attempt to export pacific-west coast scenery within a pretentious constructed politically correct package.  Everyone involved with this movie (with the exception of Max) should be put on trial for fraud!

This atrocious snoozer is so well-intentioned and morally heavy-handed that I wanted to shoot myself. It spoon-feeds you the sancimonius values you already subscribe to, convinced that that's what art is, when all they're doing is slathering Sesame Street level indoctrination onto pro-social values and basting it in liberal condescension (and I'm a liberal!). Any adult should be offended at such facile dramatic goals, but moral simpletons will consider this a masterpiece. I love the fact that when Hollywood deigns to make a movie about another race, they still hedge their bets and make the movie about a white person experiencing that persons racial problems. (Biko, Come and See the Paradise, Gandhi, etc,) You can count the number of movies made about non-caucasian issues with a non-caucasian lead on two fingers.It's also another in a long line of insufferable liberal argument films (Little Man Tate, A Perfect World, Million Dollar Baby). If you're over 60 or you watch movie previews and think That looks like a viewpoint I already agree with, this is for you. If you believe a movies job is to never make you feel anything objectionable, you're in for a treat. It's torture however for anyone with hopes that a movie might stimulate or challenge them.I'm sure people actually go into this film as bigots and come out holding hands with other races (!). Adding punishment to pain, Ethan Hawke slobbers all over another of his excruciating likable, sensitive white guy performances.

When you have two religious viewers show the most emotion when a character swears at his former love while losing a limb, you know the movie is really bad. Snow falling on cedars has way too many shots of snow actually falling on cedars. And snow falling on the ground. And people talking like they are watching snow falling. Soooo boring. Believe me, it is much better to simply sit in front of your apartment window and watch the snow actually fall then to waste money renting this movie.

But maybe a better question would been how can anyone make such a dire film ? Okay dire is maybe too strong a word but SNOW FALLING ON CEDARS is a very boring film badly structured . The victim`s body is found then the action ( I use the word action in in its loosest sense ) cuts to the trial , then cuts back to a character more than 20 years ago , then moves forward to 9 years ago during the second world war. What this all means is we`re not introduced to the characters properly which makes for a very uninvolving film . It also leaves me at a loss as to what genre the film falls into , it`s not a court room drama , or a romance , or a war film . What is it then ? A good cure for insomnia I guess   "}]
