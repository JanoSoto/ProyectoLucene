I was a regular bar goer in the 1970s and 80s and though some rock and roll bars were deafening, most dance clubs were not as loud as they are today. Conversation was a possibility back then believe it or not. I think that is one retro idea that should be revived.As for the rest of the film, I liked it. I did not think all of the elements worked however. For example, I would have liked to have seen more proof that disco was on its way out. Having guys walk around in shirts that proclaimed Disco Sucks and footage of a death to disco rally at a baseball game between the Detroit Tigers and Chicago White Sox were both evident in 1979 when that game was played. I watched that game. Incidentally, the Tigers won by forfeit as the Chicago field became a disaster area. I would have liked to have heard more of the change in music. We did hear some Blondie, but this film was supposed to take place in the early 80s. I think the song Bette Davis Eyes would have been a good choice.If you are looking for a celebration of Disco, this film isn't it. It does have some realistic portrayals of people who might have been involved in the scene. I watched the film because I disliked the whole disco scene and thought that a film showing it dying may be interesting and it did not disappoint me. If you are looking for a plot, this film doesn't have it. Not all of it worked and I was scratching my head a few times, but I think this film may become more enjoyable with a second viewing.

No, not a rehash of Boogie Nights, but the third instalment, following Metropolitan and Barcelona, of Whitman's `yuppie' odyssey.This New York yarn centres on publishing assistants Charlotte (flawless snotty American accent by Kate Beckinsale) and her best friend/biggest rival Alice (Chloe Sevigny). Bitchy Charlotte - `In physical terms, I'm cuter than you, but you're much nicer than I am,' - and Alice fall in with a parade of self-absorbed fellows in pullovers and drab ties. The `verbal' action between this set of intellectual folk takes place at a ludicrous dance palace in the very early 80s, with the `disco movement' decaying and Reagan's soul-devouring materialism taking hold.In the main these are disagreeable people, but as much as you urge yourself to loathe them, you can't quite do it. Whitman's wildly self-indulgent and witty script (`Do you think the neurological effects of caffeine are similar to that of cocaine?') makes them impossible to ignore and eventually their awfulness becomes disturbingly compelling. A bit like Friends, only without dumb Joey and flaky Phoebe.Although, aesthetically and visually Whitman's film doesn't quite ring true &#150; clothing looks too 90s and they'd never be able to talk so much in a club &#150; the dialogue is fresh and chances are you'll be grinning from here to Bolivia when the Love Train rolls through the subway at the end.- Ben Walsh  "},{"Title":"Oh, to be Young","Date":"3 December 2000","Score":"25 out of 31 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Drama, Music","Review":"  The Last Days of Disco follows a group of newly minted adults in the New York of the early 1980s.  They're affluent, and recent products of Ivy League educations but they really don't have much of a clue as to what adulthood is all about. They're groping, but they're not sure for what. They all have jobs, but their lives revolve around a posh disco where they mate, mingle, and talk. There's not much of a plot; The Last Days of Disco is mostly a series of conversions. But the conversions are wonderful. Whit Stillman's dialogue is a delight; he nails what its like during those first years of adulthood when the life of the group is replaced by a mature individuality.

More importantly, like Metropolitan, Last Days is also about group dynamic in the late 20th century. In other words, this engaging, and entertaining, film is an anthropological study of a certain subtype of human-being WASPy disco dancers from the early 1980s. As such, it should be reprehensible, right? I mean, didn't American Psycho set us straight on yuppie-dom? Well, evidently not, because Last Days of Disco is a wonderful achievement for a number of reasons. First, there is the satire. Yes, the film likes its characters, but it is not above acknowledging their inadequacies. No one is entirely likable nor is anyone a clear cut bad guy. They're all vaguely reminiscent of college-educated adults in their early 20s smart and funny but still occasionally mean and prone to bouts of foolish behavior. They're not great people but you can't hate them. Second, there's the narrative style itself. It focuses, more or less, on Charlotte and Alice but involves their friends, acquaintances, and lovers as well. In doing this, characters will show up unexpectedly (like Charlotte and Alice's roommate) and disappear just as quickly. I like movies that acknowledge that they're concerned with a certain number of characters and regard everyone else as incidental. Minor characters in a film need not remain static. They can and should change from time to time, for such is life. Third, Last Days of Disco is a paean to that danceable sound. For all the truck disco has been given over the years, it really was a remarkable period of music. Yes, there was a lot of garbage--as there is with any musical movement--but the amount of innovation that took place during the years of 1976-1980 is impressive. We continue to feel the effects of disco and are beginning to accept it as a viable musical outlet. One of the nice points made subtly by Last Days is that, in a sense, discotheques were Utopian communities at night where the Upper East Side WASPS danced next to (gasp!) blacks and gay men! The climate of the discos was accepting of people of all colors and sexual orientations. It's nice to have a film display this belief and show the disco movement its due credit. As much as I love Last Days of Disco, I think it is nevertheless an acquired taste. The dialogue, which I find scintillating, grates on the ears of others. Like the films of Wes Anderson, Whit Stillman's movies are a little precious. I like them; not everyone does. If you like interesting, though arch, dialogue and well-constructed characters, I suggest this fantastic film to you.

This is a very clever, well-written film in the Eric Bogosian or Hal Hartley style of a play for the screen. This film really does feel like theater in many ways, especially the funny and clever, tightly written dialogue.Superb performance by almost the entire cast (the one exception being McKenzie Astin, who was fairly awful, but was barely onscreen so it was shrugable), raised the film to a level above its potential. Kate Beckinsale was the perfect bitch, so annoying that I wanted to pull her out of the screen and shake her repeatedly;) Christopher Eigeman nearly stole the show as Des, he played the character perfectly, his voice and tone always on edge, the defensiveness and womanizing, the stories he told, all a brilliant package. But ChloÃ« Sevigny more than held her own, with her best performance that I've ever seen...everything from her line release to her body language stuck out; she became Alice.This film is a definite must see...a great soundtrack, great sets, brilliant writing and better acting.

If you need *something*, then avoid this movie like the plague. And while one may think to themself, dayam, those actresses look fine, there are no gratuitous skin shots. Its not a movie like Honey, where you turn off the volume and just stare at Jessica Alba.2) Its not really about the End of Disco (despite the title). The soon to be dead Disco era is a BACKDROP for the theme of the movie. Casablanca was not about WW II. It was a romance movie, and the War was a backdrop. No one bitches about the authenticity of the airplanes, uniforms, historical details of the politics or legal procedures, or portrayal of the Moroccan culture. Yes, I wish the filmmaker was a bit more zealous about period dress and music. Oh well. And while there are reminiscent touches, its not a movie who's focus is dedicated to capturing the Disco period. If what you want is an homage to Disco, then you won't like this movie.3) It IS a Coming of Age movie. It is about vapid, just-out-of-college Americans starting out in the real world. The movie mostly skewers them, but I can't help but feel a bit of nostalgia and loss for a period of life that will never come back to me (early twentysomething). I strongly suggest you avoid the movie if you're under 35. You do not need to have lived through the disco period to appreciate the movie, but you do need to be an old fogey. Definitely a movie for adults, in the non-NC17 way.4) The actors put on superlative performances. They were portraying vapid, witless, bland, soon to be full-blown yuppies. The time period is perfect for reflecting on the contrast of soon-to-be-over perceptions of life and the world from youth to early adulthood. You can almost see their worldview evolve within the one(?) year time period of the movie. There's nothing sucky about the acting. The characters are mostly sucky people; that's why they seem wooden, vapid, and lame. (And Kate Beckinsale does an AWESOME American accent; because she's British, and there isn't a hint of her native tongue.) Yes, their dancing seems lame, because the general public are generally lame dancers. People did not break out like John Travolta on the dance floor every night. Its not a movie about dancing.5) One should be appreciating the dialogue from a detached distance, and be struck by its wit and humor. Not living through these people in a first person perspective. This is for people who can appreciate reading James Joyce, Harold Pinter, or Evelyn Waugh, or any great novelist/playwright who doesn't beat you over the head (usually with a voice-over) with the meaning of every aspect of a scene. (Apologies if these writers aren't good examples; I'm having a problem recalling an ideal choice.) If the movie seems to drift and be aimless, its because life is not a continuous series of epiphanies, and this is not a typical Hollywood feature. If you need something more obvious, you WON'T like this movie.Its actually a bit hard to like this movie, but I do. I have met people who have lived through the Disco era and waxed poetic like Josh towards the end of the movie. They're actually yearning for the illusions of their youth; which is kind of what the movie is about.

The office seems less cluttered and more soothing to the creative spirit. There's an off-the-cuff reference to J.D. Salinger and his different works. There are many such random references scattered through the frames of the film. The director keeps you on your toes.

However plot is never one of his major concerns and here is no different.  The story here is less important that the period of disco which is the real focus.  This may be a bit frustrating to some as the story doesn't seeming to have any one direction.  However the characters and the dialogue will generally hold the interest sufficiently.  Some of the script is a bit weak and the characters occasionally are a bit too unsympathetic but for the majority the sharp script compliments the characters.The performances are good throughout - these socialites are not people I'd ever like to meet but they are funny from a distance.

As they have been deeply scarred in the past, the girls invent new personas for themselves and attempt to help other wounded people by embarking on various altruistic endeavours. One of their schemes involve inventing a new form of dance, in which dance becomes akin to a political movement used to spread togetherness, love and happiness.Stillman's godfather, sociologist E Digby Baltzell, authored Aristocracy and Caste in America and helped popularise the term Wasp. Stillman's films, meanwhile, tend to focus on the haute bourgeoisie, though he's more obsessed with questioning the naive assumptions they hold toward responsibility, culpability and leadership. In this regard, his films are preoccupied with characters whose well intentioned good deeds lead to disasters, or seemingly horrible characters who inadvertently help others. The intentions behind deeds are also examined is altruism really altruism if it's unconsciously rooted in selfishness? Why do good deeds do damage? And why do the noblest of intentions oft lead to unforeseen disasters? All these questions arise during one subplot in which the girls date boyfriends who are less cool and less intelligent than they are (their intention is to transform the boys into something better). In another subplot, the girls hand out soap to unhygienic male students. Both plans backfire spectacularly, with the soap turned into a weapon/game and the girls' relationships with the guys having less to do with reformation than their own personal insecurities and hangups. The film then ends with our heroes dancing to Things are looking up, originally sung by Fred Astaire in the 1937 film A Damsel In Distress.Stillman was born into a very politically active, radically left-wing family. Many critics tout him as being one of the few intellectual conservative directors, whilst others see his films as being reactionary responses to his parental upbringing. This is, after all, a guy whose films are often about vindictiveness and self-centeredness unintentionally benefiting others and well-intentioned meddling causing damage, which is of course the credo of many far right groups. But Stillman really embodies a postmodern scepticism regarding both the political left and right. When you're an egoist, none of the harm you do is intentional, characters in his earlier pictures state. And later Today barbarism is cloaked with self-righteousness and moral superiority. Elsewhere he has characters defending conservative values (marriage, monogamy etc) because, though they're simply rooted in ritualistically enforced behaviour, such behaviour was itself once deemed unconventional but has been adopted because it works for society. This argument is of course true, but also wrong in many instances. Stillman's films tend to present both sides of the coin.These contradictions become most apparent in Stillman's The Last Days of Disco. Set in the mid 1980s, Disco centres on a group of articulate urbanites. They're descendants of wealth, but have a hard time making ends meet. This at first seems like an apologia for the upper middle classes, until various mouthpieces in the film mock the troubles of our cast, even as Stillman sympathises with them.The film then watches as the college graduates of the Me Generation set about co-opting disco trends and the totems of the sexual revolution. The openness of these social movements, however, quickly gets perverted into an arena of exclusivity, money, rules and regulations. The result is the creation of a false elite those cool, attractive or pushy enough to get into the clubs and those willing to subject themselves to the club's arbitrary, superficial and capricious rules.The film then contrasts two characters. One's Charlotte (Kate Beckinsale), who's elegant, sophisticated, and always unintentionally harming others with her needle-like tongue. The other's Alice (ChloÃ« Sevigny), a quietly sensitive woman who has no idea what the sexual revolution means for people like her. Acting free and sexy gets her stigmatised as a whore, whilst acting bookish and intellectual gets her stigmatised a prude. The disco dance floors epitomise this new sexual minefield, where there are no known steps, no clear partners, where attentions constantly shift, where no one touches for long, yet where there seemingly exists no boundaries.Control your own destiny. Don't wait for guys to call. Charlotte says, which is your typical Stillman fact, in that its conservative counterpoint is then shown to be also true. Infinite choice has its own problems and self expression need not be free but a product of influence.Interestingly, Alice embodies a modernist sensibility. She has standards, values and is constantly judging and categorising. Charlotte embodies a postmodern subjectivity, which, of course, is couched in a aura of nonjudgementality, in which its deemed okay to insult and criticise because what's said is always just a silly personal opinion anyway. Charlotte's lines frequently highlight this contradiction People hate being criticised she says, before complaining that Alice was too moralistic and judgemental in college. Later Alice sleeps with a character called Tom, who promptly ditches her when Alice follows Charlote's advice to become a sexual predator. I crave sentient individuals who don't abandon their principles, Tom says, disgusted with the cheapening of romance and relations, whilst, ironically, sticking to modern conventions of openness with these lacerating speeches (and it is he who gives her a STD!). I'm beginning to think, Alice later says, that maybe the old system of people getting married based on mutual respect and shared aspirations, and slowly, over time, earning each other's love and admiration, worked the best. For Stillman, mores, commitments, values and manners have everything to do with what distinguishes us as human, they're just very fickle, unreliable things.8.5/10 - Worth one viewing.

Disco was becoming an corny attitude in the 1980's. Now we're entering in the movie. The reason given by the writer and director (this is my opinion based on the way I saw what was showed on the screen) Whit Stillman why Disco was through is that everybody focused on their work, they didn't have much time to go party, to dance and everybody's frustrated in their relationships (sexual relations and/or not helpful friends). Here we met all sort of characters, liars, arrogant, stressed, non trustful at all, but lacked one to make this movie nicer the likable character. Where's it? Where was it? Why a friendly and nice, she or he, didn't appear in the whole movie? I didn't liked any of the characters and even the one I liked it in the beginning, turn out be a jerk.The ensemble cast is overwhelming. ChlÃ¶e Sevigny (Boys Don't Cry), Kate Beckinsale (The Aviator), Mackenzie Astin (The Evening Star), Robert Sean Leonard (Dead Poets Society), David Thornton (Alpha Dog), Matt Keeslar (Splendor), Chris Eigeman (I didn't remembered any other work with him but he's got a tremendous job in this movie), Matt Ross (American Psycho) and Jennifer Beals (Flashdance). But none of them has a likable character. It's almost impossible to relate to one of them. The story itself was boring. People come and go out of the blue and their motivations on doing things are unfunny, ruthless and without a single care to bring the audience to the experience. The female characters are completely dead inside, talk to much and overreact to a simple touch of a stranger, or look into someone in the eyes and make an character judgment simply calling him as gay or non trustful. The ideological aspects in this sad movie doesn't work. If we're watching a movie that the main plot is to tell about the last days of disco why we're seeing people who aren't having fun, aren't dancing (dance in this movie was not convincing) and their only preoccupation is how to pay the rent? Only the discussion between The Lady and The Tramp was effective and kind of funny. I'm giving 5 stars to it because it was not a case of bad acting, and not even bad directing. The songs played in the movie are quite good but it lacked joyful moments where it could be played in a memorable way. The main problem is an story with no positive characters. In the middle of The Last Days of Disco there's a conversation between Kate and ChlÃ¶e and one of their bosses about how to make a best-seller's book.

Though void of a plot, sympathetic characters or anything resembling an homage to disco, the movie had a few cute scenes with some lofty life questions to contemplate. It was no Barcelona, but I sort-of enjoyed it. Although, I can't think of too many other people who would like it at all.A common theme of movie is the idea that we are programmed from a young age to be a certain way. An environmental lawyer mentions the perhaps that entire environmental movement was caused by Bambi. A nation of little kids witnessed the hunter shooting Bambi's mom and, a score later, the environmental movement comes along. Another character worries that Lady and Tramp was teaching girls to be vacuous and to be attracted to assholes.In the end of Disco, the characters learn that they may have been programmed at a young age, but it didn't matter too much. Stronger social forces push their direction more than anything else. One character, fearing she's a prude, tries to sleep around only to catch herpes. The affliction forces her back into an exclusive relationship. Another character wonders if he is happy in a relationship, but a job takes him to away from that relationship before he makes the decision for himself. A third character, though perhaps mentally unstable, is now able to live a normal life thanks to modern medication. None of them are at the mercy of their internal desires and personalities, but all of them are at the mercy of the winds of social change and luck.The characters do not even know if they truly like disco. The movement is ripped from them before any of them chooses to abandon it. Furthermore, the characters do not know even if they like each other. They are thrust in and out of each other's company by larger forces and great deal of luck (where one went to college, economic forces, who happens to be in the club on a particular evening). There is a great deal of talk about controlling one's destiny, yet no one is able to.Though I find in real life people are slightly more decisive and a lot less introspective than in Disco, the movie makes an interesting point. We look often inward and strive to improve, change and mask ourselves. Perhaps we are all programmed and full of baggage, complexes and fetishes. Whether or not we can escape our programming is an interesting question, but dwarfed by larger forces. We may have control over ourselves, but that doesn't mean we have control over our destiny.

I'm not interested in the late seventies or early eighties and disco is a form of music that has never appealed to me in such a way that it influenced my life. And since the director is a complete stranger to me, just like the majority of the cast (The only names that I immediately recognized were those of ChloÃ« Sevigny and Kate Beckinsale), there could only one reason be left why I watched it. I gave this movie a try because there was nothing else on TV and I didn't want to spend my evening by watching some stupid game show or soap opera.The story in this movie is centered around the lives of a group of friends with different backgrounds, who spend all their weekends in a famous disco. They are all looking for something. Some are looking for a nice partner, while some don't care as long as he's rich. They all have a job that demands a lot of them and the best way to forget about all their troubles is to throw themselves in the sparkling night life. It's a life of sex, drugs, music and a lot of weirdness, but when the place where they all go out is closed, their way of life abruptly ends, leaving them behind with the most important question Is disco really dead or not? The main problem that I had with this movie is that during the first half of the movie, the story didn't seem to go anywhere. This was a movie about people full of themselves, who don't care about anything or anyone as long as they can have their regular dose of drugs and partying. The characters and there dialogs had absolutely no depth and that's about the worst thing that can happen to a movie. Only in the last part, this all got a little bit better, but by then the damage was already done, making me lose interest.But it has to be said, not everything about this movie was bad. The acting for instance was OK. Even though I hadn't heard of most of them, I must say that they really did a nice job portraying these yuppies. They can't help it that they don't get any good dialogs or script to work with. That's Whit Stillman's problem, not theirs. Also good were some of the jokes, especially the one about the movie Lady and the Tramp was very witty. Still, it wasn't enough to save this movie and to make me forget about the lack of any story or real plot. That's why I give this movie a 6/10.

All the men are too anonymous and unappealing, I couldnÂ´t even keep them apart.

The only time it became really interesting was when the group discussed what the Disney movie Lady and the Tramp was really about. This could have been in any of Quentin TarantinoÂ´s pictures, but otherwise the script contains way too much plainness chatter.The movie also jumps between different time periods without telling the viewer, which makes it difficult to follow. And it doesnÂ´t explain that well why the disco era ended, more than a simple People just stopped go out on the evenings, which didnÂ´t satisfy me at all.

The Last Days of Disco is essentially an incidental theme to Stillman's third film, the plotline really revolves around young Americans falling in and out of love at the same time as commenting on the various mores of their social set. The film is heavily laced with irony, as is typical to Stillman's other films Metropolitan and Barcelona. Again, many of the jokes and humour will pass over the heads of some people unfamiliar with Stillman's style but it is well worth sticking out and/or viewing again. Stillman's obvious fondness for snobbery in modern American society is matched by his sharp perception. This third in an often (and perhaps erroneously) claimed trilogy examines the context of the club-going social set in the early eighties, unlike Metropolitan which examined the debutante set and Barcelona which was rooted in foreign perception of American culture. All are set in the early Eighties and make particular reference to those times. In this film, in particular, spot the many Disney references and the folly of the Railway Apartments. The film has a very glossy look to it, especially in the actual disco, and this draws clever comparison to the later scenes in the characters house, where affluence (or lack thereof) is denoted by the mise en scene. The film's soundtrack is excellent, featuring many forgotten disco hits.

After 30 minutes I would quite happily have settled for more glam airheads than you can shake a stick at. Rather than a movie about the demise of the disco it's more about a group of uninteresting recently-left-college-and-got-jobs-in-New-York embryonic yuppies. Yes, yuppies, so that places us firmly in the 80s, although the main characters are so bland that it could be anytime really. The whole thing is a sort of rites of passage, stage two.The only two characters that have any standout personality are Alice (Sevigny) and Des (Eigeman). Alice plays second fiddle in the sexy stakes to her workmate &#150; Charlotte (Beckinsale) - with whom she also shares an apartment. Charlotte is bitchy, but that's hardly an idea that came down with the last shower of rain and although Beckinsale does a reasonable job the bitchiness is a bit low key. But it's sufficient, I suppose, for Alice to be the focus of our sympathies. Des works at the disco, although goodness knows what he actually does, apart from get into regular trouble for letting in the wrong clientele. But Eigeman at least makes an effort to inject some character.The rest of the group drift in and out without ever making an impression. It's all far too talky; even in the disco itself everyone looks thoroughly miserable. A few odd characters float about in the background at the disco and they would probably have been more interesting than the group we're forced to be with. In particular Bernie (the owner cum drug-dealer and money-launderer) and Dan (Bernie's right-hand man who ensures only the `right' people are allowed in) would surely have made for a good story.I assume the eulogy to disco offered by one of the characters towards the end was meant as a joke. And what on earth was the closing scene &#150; everyone dancing on subway trains and platforms &#150; all about? Perhaps the production company insisted on an upbeat ending so that disco fans wouldn't leave the theatre in tears as the doors finally closed on their era.Maybe if you're into disco music this will fill your sandwich. But, in truth, you'd be better off buying a CD. Otherwise it looks like a pilot for an unsuccessful TV series. `Friends' and `Sex in the City' have nothing to fear from this.

She appears to have learned how to act by watching local-cable auto dealer commercials (Bill Smith Ford is ready to deal (smile wanly at camera)). The supporting cast seems to be reading off cue cards at times, highlighted by an embarrassing cameo from Jennifer Beals.  Only Kate Beckinsale occasionally rises above the mediocrity with a crisply acted scene.I suppose there are people who talk the way these characters do, but I've never met them.  Not even the most pompous pseudo-intellectuals I've come across consistently use such stilted syntax.  This could be forgiven if the words were compelling.  Unfortunately, 95% of the dialogue is used to set up the 5% that is interesting.  There are flashes of good writing, but the setups are so long that the jokes fall flat.The most disappointing thing about the movie is the lack of visual flair. The characters try to elevate disco to cosmic meaning, but the film makes the inside of the club look dull.

Stillman is interested here in expanding some of his favorite motifs such as, of course, disco, intellectualism (for lack of a better word), wit, snobbery, and relationships, and sacrifices very little for a mainstream audience  thus, a lot of loose ends, difficult to follow dialogue, disagreeable characters, and a generally scattered storyline.  Though the average movie-goer may see these as shortcomings, the experienced Stillman watcher realizes that much of the film's charm comes from this relatively unconventional style of filmmaking.  With overwhelming subtlety, Stillman develops his characters and their situation through vignettes and bits of dialogue.  More so than Barcelona or Metropolitan, Last Days demands the viewer's attention, as important details are easily missed as the dialogue rattles by; unsurprisingly, many viewers are left angry and embarrassed because they just failed to dig Stillman's latest groove.  For those who like to leave in the middle of the movie for more popcorn, this is not the flick for you. But, for those who pick up on the subtext, Last Days is as hilarious as Stillman's other movies, and would certainly be the most quotable if one could just catch all the lines.

But this film is a bland, somber, melancholic chat fest that demands that its audience forget everything its ever heard about or seen of or actually experienced at a disco. It's beyond stupid. The whole premise is flawed, that disco died in the early eighties - it didn't, it mutated into an even more frantic, outrageous club scene. But this true fact doesn't deter the film's creators from their inaccurate pointless fantasy.A couple of discos may have closed down or changed style in Manhattan but clubs where people danced were actually even more popular and numerous. The celebrity glitz factor may have faded, but the intense social scene was charging ahead. Cocaine was everywhere by the bucket fulls at the time, not just up Hollywood's noses, and the nightlife was running hot on its power. It was insane, deranged, unbelievable. But this dumb flick wants you to believe that a whole world was collapsing, that an entire generation of party animals quickly went extinct. Wrong.If this movie is meant to be a comment on the virus like spread of Reagonomics into every aspect of American culture throughout the 80s, then having a grand Disco as the setting pretty much mandates that the film be a broad parody. But it isn't, it's just a self conscious exercise in style. But even the style is wrong. Power suits and ties wouldn't be fashionable till the next decade. No real urban hipster in the 80's would be seen dead in a pinstripe. Designer jeans were what the heavy weights were sporting, even the upper crust. So the look is off, which leaves the substance to carry the project. What substance there is is vacuous, vapid, and very annoying.The dialog is all stilted, awkward and overly literate - unnatural. It's like listening to a lit student read his or her first script. The acting is uneven and unfocused. No one seems to know what the point of this movie is, and all the talk and gestures don't add up to anything greater than themselves. It's just a series of smugly clever comments and shallow observations, but there's no direction to any of it. ChloÃ« Sevigny is interesting to look at for a little bit but her acting is so flat and boring. Her partner, Kate Beckinsale, tries to do pump some life into the lame words she's given but there's only so much she can do with this corpse of a script.

And this, I am certain, is the way the makers intended it to be, or they wouldn't have had dialogue in 95% of the movie.  In any case, Seinfeld was immensely popular (though I actually did not like it), and it never had a plot.  And to me, its characters were exceedingly more disgusting, despicable, and immoral than the characters in this movie.Yes, some of the characters were selfish, pretentious, manipulative, and otherwise possessing negative traits; in fact, none of these characters was without flaws.  But neither are any of us, and most of us would probably not be willing to acknowledge that we or our friends possess some of the abhorrent characteristics.  I know that I have met more than one person who behaves like Charlotte, and have been on the receiving end of such behavior. And no, I don't like Charlotte, any more than I like the people who have treated me like crap in real life.  But why should all characters be likable? It is true that if you find all of these characters without merit, then this movie would suck.  But I did not dislike all of these characters. I understand Alice very well, and while I have not seen any other movie Chloe Sevigny has been in, I saw the acting that others call wooden as very true to the character she was playing.  Alice is supposed to be timid and uncertain about everything (which sometimes caused he not to say much, and perhaps appear stupid in some people's minds), etc, etc.  I do agree that she was very uninteresting for the first bit of the movie, seemingly just following Charlotte around like a puppy, but when her true character is revealed, I think her wallpaper act is quite appropriate to her personality.Even those characters I found morally repugnant, like Des and Charlotte, I still could understand them and have some small sense of sympathy for people trying to be good but being bogged down by their own self-absorption.  I also liked Mackenzie Astin in this movie, even though he didn't get to do much; what is a bit disconcerting is that he still looks so much like he did when he was on The Facts of Life when he was about 12.  In too many movies, the protagonists are all simply good and the antagonists are all plain bad; I do like movies that have flat characters, but it is nice to see a movie where the characters are more tangible and don't seem like something out of a fairy tale.At the very least, this movie showed that not only bad people get STDs. In most movies, such things are not discussed, and if they are, it is always the slimy characters that have the STD (unless it's a movie about AIDS), which is hardly the way it works in real life.  To show a sweet, perhaps naive, girl like Alice who gets a little something extra the very first time she has sex sends a certain message about knowing people and their sexual history before you sleep with them, without coming off as horribly preachy.This movie is about real people; so what if the setting wasn't accurate (though I have no idea myself if this is the case) or the songs weren't current? And some people do talk like that- believe those of us who have met them.  And even if it was played up a little bit- hey, it's a movie.

Also, some of the characters are shallow again.However, this is the first Stillman film I've somewhat enjoyed thanks to, again, his dialogue(like the whole LADY AND THE TRAMP sequence), but more importantly, the two leads and the music.  Kate Beckinsale fufils the promise she showed in COLD COMFORT FARM, here playing not only a convincing American, but making us understand an unsympathetic character.  Chloe Sevigny also fufills the promise she showed in KIDS and TREES LOUNGE, playing Beckinsale's best friend; she knows how to be vulnerable without being maudlin, and even shows a little sneakiness of her own.  Also should mention Chris Eigeman, who brightened up Stillman's first two movies and does the same here.  I never hated disco, and still like some of it, and the choices here are good.Speaking of those choices, some have said how the music is late 70's, when the movie is early 80's.  First of all, it may be a rights question, as to what Stillman could get.  Secondly, the movie, in this sense, is similar to THE ICE STORM, in that both movies are about what happens when the middle-class finally gets ahold of a major trend(in THE ICE STORM, it was the sexual revolution, here it's disco), so it's appropriate that the music is from disco's peak period.

It's already a cult classic -- take a look at the prices for OOP copies on Amazon -- and it provides a picturesque look at some of the wretched excesses of the end of the disco era. When it comes to understanding the American experience in the twentieth century, there are important parallels between the Roaring 'Twenties and 'Seventies. Both eras ended with a kind of hangover from the initial exuberance and expansion that kicked them off. Maybe it's a bit of a stretch, but in a limited way, the Last Days of Disco is as good a meditation on the end of its era as The Great Gatsby is about the end of the Jazz Age.Some people won't like this film because they'll have a hard time relating to the yuppies who are the major characters, but the character development (or lack thereof) is one of the movie's major strengths. Director Stillman is in perfect control of the dynamics of their interactions. He knows all these people very well from real life.Although it's a wee bit stilted at times, another strength of the movie is its dialog, which is very original and first class. The Last Days of Disco is a superb tableau of the morality of its times and deals with a number of themes that are central to the human condition.All in all, I think this movie deserved a better fate than it has received so far. I'm afraid that it was probably as big a failure as Barcelona was a success, and I find it sad that Stillman, whom I regard as a very original voice in American movies, has perhaps been unable to find backers for new projects since that time, although I understand that he may soon (2007) finally have another release in the offing. If you like The Last Days of Disco, you will almost certainly enjoy his two earlier films, Metropolitan and Barcelona.

Chris Eigeman is again brilliant as the witty cad, and the film contains  enough highbrow quips to keep you smiling all the way through, if it never is  laugh-out loud funny. What I found interesting was Stillman's weaving ofcameos from his two earlier films. The Sally Fowler crowd fromMetropolitan and Charlie Boynton (Taylor Nichols) from Barcelona bothappear at the club, and if you read the credits, you'll realize that Josh shares  the same last name (Neff) as Fred from Metropolitan- they are probablyrelated. In fact, whole scenes and exchanges seem to be lifted fromMetropolitan - the taxi ride over the bridge, many of the conversations- Joel  seems like another Tom Townsend and Alice seems to be the new AudreyRouget---even down to the voice. What is largely puzzling about the cameoswas the fact that Metropolitan seemed definitely set in the mid-to-late 1980s  and Barcelona in the 90's- not so much from pop culture references, sincethere were none, but from costumes, hair and surroundings and exterior shotsof New York and Barcelona. Then, we're asked to believe that both thosemovies took place *before* the late 1970s? In fact, aside from the soundtrack,  there were no clues or costuming to place this film in the early 80s (Blondie  appears on the soundtrack - that's about it). If he was going to celebrate the  passing of an era, Stillman could have paid more attention to that- but in his  defense he did avoid the white-polyester-suit cliches of the era. However, it  seems more like disco is peripheral, instead of integral, to the lives of the  characters, even as it purports it to be.... That club was awfully brightly lit,  and the haircuts and suits were completely 1990s. It seemed to share artdirection more with Less Than Zero and American Psycho than with 54, That70s Show (which doesn't exaggerate that much, believe it or not) or BoogieNights. Fine performances all around, fantastic dialogue, a  great evilcharacter from Kate Beckinsale, and Chloe Sevigny is sweetly radiant.

Big mistake this is a Great Movie.This director makes his own genres and writes some of the most intelligent dialog on celluloid.  He doesn't have to exaggerate life to make it interesting.  I rented Heat (a star-studded Michael Mann crime orgy) on the same night.  LDoD is the perfect contrast to that kind of absurd Hollywood formula blockbuster. Heat bore no resemblance to reality, was packed with glamorous locations, hot sex, spectacularly cold-blooded violence, tragic soap opera catharsis, and famous actors posing with guns but it failed to be anything but predictable.  LDoD makes the commonplace into a fresh and compelling story.Alice and Charlotte are two pretty college graduates living it up at their favorite disco club in New York.  Charlotte is confident, shallow, hypocritical, ruthless, and manipulative.  Alice is decent and intelligent but not sure enough of her own natural charm to be herself.  She lets Charlotte persuade her into playing psychological games with men to become more popular.  Competing for their affections are Des (the male version of Charlotte and a professional night club flunky), Jimmy (a junior ad executive desperate to get his clients in past the hostile owner), and Joel (a sincere, noble, and thoughtful assistant D.A. dogged by a bad rep from a nervous breakdown in college).The plot is supposed to be about shady dealings Joel is secretly investigating.  The real STORY is about whether the basic goodness in Joel and Alice will prevail in an era that glorified everything but.All the characters are in love with Disco's allure-- the romantic dreamworld where they can escape from their diffucult careers and find happiness with anyone on any given night.   The script's best lines are not about the characters, but the times.

It's been a while since I had seen Metropolitan, but once Last Days opened I immediately recognized the style -- young Ivy Leaguers in the professional world waxing philosophical about their lives and everything around them. The good news is that unlike Metropolitan, which I remember to be a little stilted and heavy -- with the exception of Chris Eigeman -- Last Days tries to be a little more breezy. That's saying something, considering Last Days has moments when it does drag. But I choose to remember this movie as having some excellent scenes, such as when the characters discuss Lady and the Tramp and pretty much nail it. Once again, Eigeman does a great job with a multi-faceted character, while Chloe Sevigny and Kate Beckinsale hold the movie together relatively well at its center.

His characters spend a majority of the time in his films simply talking.  And unlike the forced hip language found in a score of recent movies and popular tv shows, Stillman's writing does fit with the way some people actually talk.  In the Last Days of Disco, he uses the setting of a popular disco club as a forum for some fascinating character interaction.This film contains a terrific ensemble cast of relative unknowns that shines within the confines of the intriguing script.  The best scenes come from Chris Eigeman, a Stillman regular. He has a habit of playing apparent jerks who end up becoming the most likable characters in the film.  He has mastered this personality type in Stillman's Barcelona and Metropolitan, plus Kicking and Screaming and Mr. Jealousy, two great Noah Baumbach comedies.  In the Last Days of Disco, his sarcastic, frank demeanor works masterfully as Des, a nightclub manager who has some problems with drugs and women.  Eigeman always comes out looking good, however, and delivers some of the funniest lines in the film.After playing a kind, upper-class helper in Cold Comfort Farm, Kate Beckinsale is a surprise as Charlotte, a girl with a big personality who puts Chloe Sevigny's Alice through hell for much of the film.  Because of her exceptional beauty, it takes a little while to realize the extent of her selfishness and egotism. Once she gets going though, there's no doubt she cares for only only one person, herself.  The film also features a likable performance by Mackenzie Astin and a silly cameo from Jennifer Beals as one of Des' spurned lovers.Whit Stillman has an amazing method of combining a bunch of story lines into a coherent whole.  He takes the disco era as a background and expands it into much more because he lets his characters talk.  At this time, I still regard Barcelona as his best film. I grew more attached to the characters, and the foreign setting provided an interesting subtext on relations with America.  However, after watching the Last Days of Disco a second time, it's beginning to win me over. It's nice to see Stillman continue to grow as a director.  The dance sequences are dazzling and fun, but he doesn't overdo it and sacrifice character development.  Plus, although I'm not a huge disco fan, I really enjoyed virtually all of the songs.The Last Days of Disco works because it's very funny, has great acting, and is totally different from a majority of the movies coming out today.

Also, it was accurate for them to play music released before 1980 or 81. A dance club at that time would have done that. They were still playing the hustle right up until the end. Besides, Disco was pretty much dead already by then, so there weren't too many new Disco hits to choose from. If you want to watch an accurate movie about that time period, the best I can think of are Summer of Sam and Detroit Rock City.

At first, I wasn't sure about this film. It is very slow-moving, does not have much action, and most of the characters are not very likeable. And yet, something about this film intrigued me so I watched it again. The dialogue sounds real--if you have spent any time with NYC intellectuals, they do sound just like this. And yet this movie also manages to poke fun at them. The humor is very subtle and hard to catch at first viewing, but it's there alright, most obviously in the character of Des, a disco manager who lets his friends in through the back door, and ends his relationships by telling the women that he is gay (he isn't). The only problem with this film is the blandness of the rest of the male characters--they are hard to remember and their parts could easily be interchanged since they seem to all be playing basically the same person. The two female leads are the most developed characters--Alice (Chloe Sevigny, of Kids), basically reprising her role as a quiet, sexually naive young woman and her psuedo-friendship with the bitchy and shallow Charlotte (Kate Beckinsale). Though Charlotte initially appears to be the character with more confidence, as the story unfolds we see tha she is actually rather pathetic and that her hardness is really just a cover for her insecurity and envy of her quieter friend. Des is quietly hilarious, with his huge pop-eyes and pained facial expressions. Josh (the manic depressive) seems a bit too normal, but it fits that he's the one who ultimately wins Alice in the end...or seems to. The selection of disco songs is wonderful, with a number of great but forgotten songs. Anyone expecting another Boogie Nights or an ode to the '70's will be disappointed--as this is really a comedy of manners and a social commentary on a certain group of people rather than a period-piece.

This film was so bad it was empty, bland; you didn;t get a feel of late 1970s society at all, though some Disco sucks footage was crammed in. I stayed with this film cos I was thinking this has got to get better and I was amazed that a film could be so bad.This was about a group of lame, empty, self-obsessed Yuppies, whose horrible dancing was the most entertaining thing in the movie, and who I suspect were responsible in their own sweet way for the demise of disco ( why would you go to dance disco in a tie and suit?)

Generally, The Last Days Of Disco presents a wonderfully hilarious multi-character piece that builds with multiple viewings.Alice (ChloÃ« Sevigny) and Charlotte (Kate Beckinsale) are a pair of young assistants to assistant editors at a mid-sized Manhattan publisher, circa The very early 1980s. How early? Disco is still going on, particularly in one local club frequented by the two girls and their college friends.Stillman movies always make for a certain disconnect. You can read it in the reviews here, about the dialogue that doesn't sound real, too term- paperish. I have another favorite writer who often has his characters speak in iambic pentameter, and I've learned to get over it. The problem with Stillman here is certainly not his inability to write clever, piquant dialogue.I still consider myself a loyal adherent to the disco movement?It's a movement?That's like something out of the Nazis!Every time you made love to me, you must have wanted to vomit!No, no, no. You're beautiful. You don't have to be some sweaty horny hetero he-ape to admire and appreciate female beauty.Of course it's formulaic. It's a formula!It's true, Des, your mouth does look gay.And for those people who say, not without merit, that Stillman can't come up with a decent piece of dialogue that doesn't involve twelve adverbs and six past imperfect verbs, I submit one from this movie that consists of a single letter H!What Disco has going for it, beyond all else, is the performances of its two stars. Beckinsale is incredibly beautiful here playing a wonderfully coy and slightly evil American vixen. She's a b-word, but with a heart of silver, not insensitive to the effect of her slings, who wins our heart despite herself. One thing I've learned is people hate being criticized, she says at one point, as if surprised herself at the insight.Sevigny is even better as the heart of the film, a gentle character whose reaction shots sell us on the story more than anyone else's words. Whether she's with the dicey but delicious Des (Stillman regular Chris Eigeman) or the quietly intense, somewhat unstable Josh (Matt Keeslar), Sevigny keeps your sympathies centered around her character to a degree no other lead in a Stillman film ever has.That's about the highest praise I can offer Last Days, that Sevigny and Beckinsale represent the best female performances in a Stillman film. It's not as well-balanced as Barcelona or Metropolitan, the two other films of Stillman's I've seen (and some of whose characters pop up here.) The disco music is welcome though the period atmosphere is lacking, as I see this as a product entirely of the 1990s, the decade in which it was made. And the joining of Alice and Charlotte's stories with that of the fall of a club which is but isn't Studio 54 doesn't gel as well as it could have.But speaking as a Stillman fan, I love this film every bit as much as his other two 20th-century offerings, even if I can't recommend it as unreservedly. He was rushing to get this out, and it shows. But there's no shame in being a Stillman fan like I am when this is his weakest film.

How can it be otherwise? Here he offers us - could we call it a vision? - Candide (in his simple, clear morality) in a Chekhovian play keeping time in Bret Easton Ellis' era. It can't equate into more than zero, but it warps itself out unbalancing that 80's nothing, proving in a blink of an eye the famous less is more.

Plus, in places like New York it fed into an unhealthy velvet rope scene.But, I'm here to tell you that in Baltimore, where I'm from, it was totally healthy, whoa-baby, party-down fun. I also think it was a major gay-straight bonding thing, which the movie is very clear about. Also, it kept America dancing through a time too many people where enthralled by Led Zeppelin and the Allman Brothers, who ruled the airwaves but who you could not dance to.Chloe Sevigny is perfectly cast here. She's a downtowner who comes across with a level head. She has a look. Prominent upper lip blonde with sharp chin, but still pretty. She's cool in every scene. The dudes in the movie are practically interchangeable. They are all Squareheads aspiring to hipness.Whit Stillman is the poet of hip New Yawkness and all of that is on display here. The young women are aspirants in the publishing industry. They look good and the movie dotes on them. They belong in nightclubs.I didn't live in Manhattan in the disco era.

This film was a pleasant and engaging slice of life from the late 70s early 80s in New York.  There is really not much to say about the characters or the plot, only that they are peripheral to Stillman's style.  The man could make boiling water seem interesting.Overall, I would recommend this film highly to anyone who has any interest in Wood Allen-esque films (at least his earlier stuff).

Sure critics said that they were self serving, preachy and essentially about a bunch of kids who whined about how good life was.  Balderdash.  Films such as Metropolitan, Singles, and Slacker showed the alienation of this generation and the ways in which young people today tried to cope with taking their place in the world.  By the time Pulp Fiction came, this art form had been nearly perfected.  Then something happened.  These movies kept coming.  Kicking and Screaming, The Pompotus of Love.

The Last Days Of Disco is dedicated to that era in American history sandwiched between the turbulent 60s and the materialistic 80s. Most of the plot takes place at a Manhattan disco, a cavernous, rather opulent, room where an eclectic mix of people dance disco, surrounded by strobe lights and confetti. Here, the ensemble cast order their favorite drinks and chitchat about this and that, their web of social connections a tad confusing at times.I liked the casting of not-so-well-known actors. But some of their performances were a bit wooden. Costumes and production design mirror the era glitter quite well. This is a big-budget production.A lot of viewers will find the thin plot annoying, and the shallow, self-absorbed characters off-putting. But as nostalgia, The Last Days Of Disco works, helped mostly by those terrific songs. If only the soundtrack had included Fly, Robin, Fly.

It is obvious, contrived, poorly directed and unrealistic.  It involves a bunch of shallow Harvard graduates who come and go from a disco in NYC in the early eighties.  The dialogue among the characters is trite and unclever (although others have said it is ironic, it tries to be but is not). They are one dimensional beings, played half heartedly by a group of apparently disinterested actors.  The disco scenes are unrealistic.  Nobody can carry on a lengthy, existentialist conversation about, for example, Lady and the Tramp in a night club, reclining around a coffee table and speaking at a normal sound levels.  This goes on throughout the film!  This film is a big disappointment after Barceloa, which was slick and clever.  I would caution anyone against spending money seeing this film.

They all have the same feel, creepy--almost voyeuristic and with no characters that anyone can care about. The dialogue is intense and the whole of all of his movies. That's not necessarily a bad thing but when the characters are unremittingly ugly inside, it just becomes wearing on one's psyche. That the relationships and the dialogue are unusual and particularly characteristic of this director/writer, is what makes me imagine why he is a darling with the critics. I feel certain that unusual all by itself goes a long way toward getting a good review from people who have to watch an unending parade of painfully similar, simplistic and bad Hollywood films.His dialogue is uniquely his in much the same way Woody Allen's is in his movies. I guess you either love it or hate it. So if you liked Barcelona and Metropolitan, you'll probably like this one too. If not, don't waste your time.

It has nothing to do with disco at all.  The title is very misleading indeed, as all the main characters do is aimlessly wander AROUND a disco, moaning about their inane lives.  What they've tried to do here, is a sort of American Graffiti multiple stories thing, with a group of yuppies thrown into the mix. But the script is too weak to hold the attention, and the acting lame.  Kate Beckinsale and Chloe Sevigny look wonderful, but act poorly.  Maybe it was the fault of the paper thin script, and not their acting skills which caused their poor performances. Also, it just doesn't LOOK like the late '70s or early '80s.  I just wish that whenever people make a film like this, they could at least get the fashions and the hairstyles right.  And, it doesn't really show you what partly brought about the demise of those heady days; A thing called AIDS.Dazed And Confused, Thank God It's Friday, Saturday Night Fever, even 54...These are better 'coming of age' or 'rites of passage' movies, which are set or actually made during the aforementioned time.

What happened with this one? One of the other reviewers on this site talked about the lack of a specific plot -that was my major gripe here but even movies that don't have a MAJOR plot-or even occasionally movies with NO plot can survive if they have depth of characters or something to make the movie involving.Unfortunately, you don't get involved with these characters at all. I love movies about the glitsy disco days so, from my thinking a movie's gotta have something missing if it can't even hold my interest on an interesting subject matter.I also enjoy movies that are dialogue driven but in this movie's case, for some reason, the extreme talkiness detracted from my enjoyment for some reason. In any event-to each their own, I know people who hated 54 which I thought was well done. In any event-this one I was a bit let down by and probably wouldn't see again.

The paralells to Studio 54 are quite clear (the employee/club owner relationships and the secret stashes of money, the way the club and characters met their downfall when the club went down in the early 80s etc)... The plot seemed to advance SO slowly it was rediculous. I viewed it on video, and we skipped alot but even an hour into the film we noticed the characters were still interacting the same way, talking about the same exact things etc. This film did such a terrible job of portraying the era. The characters did use old phones at their offices, but almost all the costumes, especially for the girls at the night club, could have been pulled off store racks in the late 90s, as was infact probably done. They looked more like evening gowns for new years parties in 1999 than anything that would have been worn to a night club in the disco period. I kept hoping for a glimpse of long sideburns, long hair etc, but the best we got were a few retro-ish hairstyles on the blonde girl, nothing really to make us think we were in 1980.I feel that the film has failed on every level. The slow script takes far to long to go anywhere, the characters were visualised so badly that it looked like the film was taking place in the year it was made rather than 1980. The club scenes had so much talking going on, and at such a low voice level, that it was un-believealble. They WERE in a dance club after all... The only 2 good qualities in the film were the fun music, but it was badly matched to some scenes, so the characters werent even dancing on the beats, and also the night club set was quite well presented. Too bad that we had a vast array of images of people, mostly looking like they were from the late 80s to the late 90s instead of a uniform presentation of people who were living in 1980.

Trying to describe this film is like trying do describe Seinfeld It's about nothing. The whole film is dialogue and background so unevenly pieced together, that I was having trouble figuring out who was who (since most of the male actors are so much alike in personality and appearance) and also because the film started out slow, denying me a chance to get know and care about the characters. And when you don't care...what's the points of watching. In fact the only emotion any of these people inspired in me were dislike. The guys were snobby, wannabe intellectuals who babbled lines they seemed to write before they left home. And the conversations they have were supposed to ignite dislike or at least distrust in the female characters but this doesn't happen. They fall for the guy, although this really doesn't matter because there is no right guy. They're all Ivy League yuppy scum miscreants lacking charm and wit. So all in all this film fails as a love story, cuz no one falls in love.And as a social study, because were viewing an era of history known as disco, where the characters don't really love disco. They either love the fact that thay can get into a club or that they are in fact part of the disco era. They're living a lie.And finally as a good movie in general, because it commits the cardinal sin It's boring.  It expects me to care about characters I hate, and thus I hated this film.

I enjoyed the development of her relationship with Alice, although I think that Holly's character could have been a little more developed.
