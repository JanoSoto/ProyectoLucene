I was disappointed because of the wonderful way in which  the story was laid out and unfolded itself in the beginning, then seemed to  fall away during its 2nd act. The reverse theme of bad kids turning good  was fascinating, and the paranoid performance by Nick Stahl was worth  watching and intrigued me. But then, as soon as Stahl was converted, the  film started to fall apart. For one Stahl was the only character I found to  be truly worth watching. Marsden and Holmes were just two pretty faces  noticeably void of much talent; I never believed the two as a couple, and I  never found any reason to invest myself in hoping for their well-being  other the fact they were the lesser of two evils. But most noticeably, I  grew disinterested because of the change in aim by the makers. The first  half of the film, which by itself I would have given an 8 or 9 out of 10,  was more of a grown-up horror movie, where the situation and plot rather  than actions dictated the fear of the audience. But after Stahl disappears  to the dark side, the film changed into a teen slasher film almost, where  blood, violence and screaming is used in a vain attempt to induce fright.  This 2nd half was worth a 4 or 5 out of 10. The length did not bother me as  much as others (I've seen plenty of effective movies that were under 90  minutes). What bothered me more was the lack of development in some key  plot points. I think the entire conspiracy plot behind the conversion of  the teens needed to be fleshed out much more, characters needed to be drawn  more distinctly, and so on. So I balance out the two halves and come up  with a 6 out of 10. Worth renting, but could have been something special.

Granted, few teen movies are designed to treat their subjects with any degree of seriousness. And of all the film genres, horror is kept alive with only the slightest bit of effort, accompanied by even slighter expectations. But director David Nutter tackles both these obstacles in a rare attempt to sophisticate Hollywood's offerings to teen audiences and bring dignity to the maligned horror genre. Despite a screenplay written contrary to his vision, Nutter succeeds in creating a dramatic, moody, and entertaining sci-fi/horror yarn far more difficult to dismiss than its contemporary equivalents. That is, until MGM destroyed it.It's important to note that the version of Disturbing Behavior being analyzed here is the director's cut, which is not the version released in theaters. Nutter's cut isn't available commercially, but if you watch the DVD's considerable amount of deleted footage and the original ending, you can see just how devastating the studio's changes were. After suffering the loss of his older brother, Steve and his family relocate to Cradle Bay, where some of the kids at school aren't quite themselves these days. With the help of friends Rachel (Katie Holmes) and Gavin (Nick Stahl), Steve discovers that a local doctor, Caldicott (Bruce Greenwood), is conspiring with parents to lobotomize their teens in order to create good boys and girls, all of whom become members of the school's Blue Ribbon elitist clique. Caldicott's experiments prevent the Blue Ribbons from sexual impulses and mold them into academic achievers that spend a great deal of their time trying to recruit others to the program. Unfortunately, the experiments don't always work and trouble is at hand, especially when Steve's parents sign him up.Scott Rosenberg, the screenwriter of the film, later expressed great disappointment with Nutter's handling of the material. Rosenberg, the screenwriter of Con-Air and Beautiful Girls, never intended his script to be treated as dramatically or realistically as Nutter executed it. Instead, it was supposed to be more hip and cool, allegedly without being mired down by characterization or atmosphere. This seems to indicate that the screenwriter, like the studio executives, had low ambitions with the material, planning to do nothing more than churn out another cheap horror film that insults the intelligence of its target audience. David Nutter, a veteran director of The X-Files, saw the potential in Rosenberg's script and acted on it. He started by casting three of the most talented young actors in Hollywood. James Marsden breaks the stereotype that models can't be good actors by delivering a subtle, restrained performance as Steve. Katie Holmes has a few opportunities to demonstrate her abilities as well. As the socially outcast Rachel, Holmes combines a defensive posture with an underlying desire to connect. Nick Stahl has the meatiest part, playing the cynical Gavin, a critic of all the other cliques at school. Gavin's quiet omnipotence is colored by a dry sense of humor much needed in the film. Other notable performances include William Sadler as Newberry, the school's janitor. Newberry is a little off kilter, squinting, grumbling, and hell-bent on ridding the world of all rats. Another interesting character who almost steals the show is U.V. (Chad E. Donella), Gavin's reticent albino friend who spends most of the film sitting at Gavin's side and uttering only a few syllables. Nutter's style is very much the signature X-Files style, dark, steamy, creepy, and purposeful. To achieve this, Nutter enlisted an X-Files photographer (John S. Bartley), the X-Files composer (Mark Snow), several X-Files actors (including Steve Railsback, aka Duane Barry), and key production personnel. The result is a movie that feels like an X-Files spin-off, with a subdued ambiance that washes over you and gets under your skin. Nutter commissioned one of the more remarkable opening title sequences in recent film history, one that serves as a cinematic prelude to the lobotomy procedure later in the film - a rapidly-edited montage of happy images and words designed to hypnotize and brainwash Caldicott's victims. If Disturbing Behavior should be criticized, it certainly loses points in its third act, one that falls dangerously close to clich√©, with Steve becoming more the archetypal hero figure in a predictable and unimaginative showdown with Caldicott and the Blue Ribbons. Since the third act of any story is largely plot (character development is usually pretty well wrapped-up by then), I imagine Nutter had little to work with from Rosenberg's original screenplay. That the first two acts were so emotionally engaging is the result of Nutter's persistence and better judgment. It's too bad that MGM freaked out after a test screening in Texas and thought they could improve their numbers by shortening the film and forcing it into the cookie-cutter shape of the average, low-achieving horror flick. I champion this film because of its thematic content and its ideology. Like many of my favorite films (RoboCop, Dances with Wolves, Rebel Without a Cause), it deals with characters in crises of identity, trying to become or remain whole, and connect with each other. Equally interesting to me are the notions of sexual repression as a sign of perfection, man playing God, parents' willingness to medically alter their children, and human unwillingness to face loss. Nutter's bold vision for this material, his ability to cull it from a screenplay where it was not just dormant, but banished, makes his director's cut a remarkable achievement. Add in the exemplary performances of Marsden, Stahl, and Holmes, and that special X-Files flare, and I've got something I can really sink my teeth into. - Scott Schirmer  "},{"Title":"Reasonable, but Could Be Great","Date":"19 June 2008","Score":"14 out of 15 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Horror, Mystery, Sci-Fi","Review":" After the suicide of the teenager Allen Clark (Ethan Embry), his family decides to move from Chicago to the quiet Cradle Bay Island seeking a peaceful life for the siblings Steve (James Marsden) and Lindsay Clark (Katharine Isabelle). When Steve joins the local high-school, the outcast Gavin Strick (Nick Stahl) befriends Steve and introduces his also rejected friend Rachel Wagner (Katie Holmes) to the newcomer. Gavin exposes to Steve in the refectory the punks, the nerds and the different tribes of the school and he defends the weird theory that a sinister force changes the behavior of the annoyingly perfect Blue Ribbons, a group of good students that wear identical jackets and gather in the Yogurt Shoppe. Further he tells that he had witnessed the blue ribbon Andy Efkin (Tobias Mehler) killing their schoolmate Mary Jo (Natassia Malthe) that is missing and the local Officer Cox (Steve Railsback) covering the murder. Steve does not believe on Gavin words, but when his friend is submitted to the treatment of Dr. Edgar Caldicott (Bruce Greenwood) and immediately changes his behavior, joining the Blue Ribbons, Steve and Rachel decides to investigate the mystery discovering the dark secret of the perfect behavior.Disturbing Behavior has an intriguing beginning, with a murder and a group of former troublemakers and potheads transformed in perfect students, like in the classic Invasion of Body Snatchers. However, when the paranoid Gavin changes his behavior, the plot becomes silly and flawed, and the conclusion is awful. I saw this movie for the first time on 25 March 2000 and I keep my original opinion that this movie is reasonable, but could be great with improvements in the second-half of the story.

We later learn his brother Allen died, and that has something to do with the move. At his new high school, he meets Gavin and U. V., who take drugs and listen to depressing heavy metal music. Gavin has the hots for Lorna, but she's a Blue Ribbon, a member of a group of students that help out in the community and help each other study. Gavin wants nothing to do with these people.It turns out the Blue Ribbons aren't as goody-goody as they first appear. To call them snobs is an understatement. Anyone who isn't a member is treated like dirt, but of course new members are accepted all the time. The organization had its beginning with a deadly car wreck, and Dr. Edgar Caldicott played a large role in getting it started.This film reminds me of an episode of 'Smallville', except only the villains (who appear to be the good kids) have the super powers. Or maybe they're not actually super powers. This film had its own version of Belle Reve, where all the Smallville freaks seemed to end up eventually. Also, there was the loud alternative rock music in some scenes and the pleasant classical-style background music in others. I really liked the music in Roscoe's Yogurt Shoppe and in the asylum (I'm referring to Barry Manilow).I actually found the bad kids appealing in this movie--Gavin, Rachel, and Dickie in particular. The real standout character, though, is the demented janitor Mr. Newberry, who comes across as if Gilbert Gottfried had played the Bill Murray role in 'Caddyshack'. Another good though brief performance came from Julie Patzwald as Betty Caldicott.This was a little on the violent side, but I guess for the type of movie it wasn't too bad. A lot of bad language seemed to have been cleaned up for TV. And I'm not sure whether this is something that was edited out, but in one scene, the position of a girl's head relative to her date suggests something that happened in Bill Clinton's White House.It wasn't a classic by any means, but it wasn't too bad.

The plot is obviously stolen from Invasion of the Body Snatchers, only it's severely simplified so that fans of dud high-school shows like Beverly Hills 90210 can get some thrills out of it. The evil school psychiatrist (!) of Cradle Bay island plants computer chips into the brains of mediocre students and, overnight, they mutate into grade-A model adolescents. New arrival Steve Clark teams up with pothead Gavin and hottie Rachel to prevent this from happening to them. Not a single storyline in the script is adequately explained (the reason behind Steve's brother's suicide, the flaws of the 'good behavior'-program, the connection with rodents, etc...) and whenever the film threatens to become too incoherent, the camera quickly zooms in on Katie Holmes sexy belly in order to distract your attention. The attempts to create suspense and mystery are laughable, the use of clich√©s and stereotypes is dreadful and many lines are vaguely offensive. The climax is hilarious, though. Good actors, like William Sadler and Steve Railsback, make fools out of themselves in the supportive cast. High-school horror was inexplicably popular near the end of the 1990, but this film is the absolute low point of them all. Better watch The Faculty...or even I Know What You Did Last Summer.

Every actor is perfect for their roles (although William Sadler's accent is ridiculous), every location looks like it was created to be in this movie (several locations are in The 6th Day) and the story was great.Although basically just a rehash of the Stepford Wives, this movie is set for for teen audiences and director David Nutter makes the story seem completely original.The story is this A boy and his family move to Cradle Bay to try and escape the memories of his brother, who committed suicide. When the boy, Steve (played by X-Men star James Marsden) starts school he quickly makes friends with outcast Gavin (Nick Stahl of T3), who explains to Steve that something fishy is going on as his friends have traded in their sex, drugs and rock and roll lifestyles to join the Blue Ribbons, the straight-A good boy jocks and cheerleaders. Gavin then introduces Steve to his friend Rachael (the talented Katie Holmes) who he falls in love with. Inevitably, Gavin becomes a Blue Ribbon. Steve and Rachael then try to find out what is going on and how to stop it while trying to stop themselves becoming part of the group.This is a great story of love and paranoia. The lunch room Freak Roll Call is a scene not to be missed.The only problem is the way the film has been edited. On the DVD are 10 additional scenes which expand on such stories such as Steve's parents fearing he will commit suicide like his brother (which is irrelevent in the theatrical cut) and expansions on the paranoia. There is also an alternate ending that shows us an exciting final confrontation between Steve and Gavin. This movie was rushed into cinemas and not properly done so it becomes a standard teen flick.My advice, rent or watch this movie on TV and if you enjoy it slightly, go purchase the DVD to broaden and expand you're enjoyment of this film.

The local high school is populated by picture perfect teens who, despite their wholesome love of yogurt, tend to get a little trigger happy when the hormones start flying. When the new kid in town (Jason Marsden) stumbles upon a dark secret, it's up to him and a few other mistfits (Nick Stahl, Katie Holmes) to shut down the powers that be.There's loads of potential in this film that is, unfortunately, never capitalized upon. You can thank the editing department for that one. If the deleted scenes are any evidence, this movie was trimmed and dumbed down to the point of no recognition. While the uninterrupted flow makes for an easy, breezy viewing, the overall story lacks substance and coherence. Its 84 minute running time, in turn, is a redeeming feature.The director, David Nutter, spends much of the film building up ample amounts of atmosphere and is aided wonderfully by a brilliant score by fellow X-Files alumnus Mark Snow as well as some striking scenery thanks to it's Vancouver location. So, the film isn't a complete waste. You'll get some kicks out of the dialog and while Katie Holmes in particular isn't given much to do, she at least looks good in skimpy outfits while doing so. Also, it's hard to hate on a movie that is of a more intelligent cut than the other teen-geared fare being produced in its time. The movie at least aims high, and even when it doesn't quite reach, it never bores.A passable sci-fi teen romp, Disturbing Behavior is entertaining late-night fodder that, surprisingly, will inspire repeat viewings. It's a shame, though, to think of how much better the whole could have been. "}{"Title":"Mr. Newberry here got the full on Boo Radley, village idiot, Quasimodo thing going.

Disturbing Behavior obviously rode on the then recent success of teen horror films like Scream (1996) & I Know What You Did Last Summer (1997) amongst others. The script by co-producer Scott Rosenberg plays like an episode of The X-Files (1993 - 2002) which isn't a surprise as Nutter directed 15 episodes of the show. It tries to keep everything under wraps until the revealing climax & it does a good job of doing so while at the same time keeping the viewer interested in where the story & characters are going. Disturbing Behavior isn't an action heavy film, it relies more on dialogue, mystery & suspense to engage the viewer. I found all the characters surprisingly likable which is very unusual for a teen horror, the clich√©s are almost used to Disturbing Behavior's advantage with a great speech by Gavin as he explains the school's social structure using stereotypes. It's well written with some witty dialogue with Gavin in particular seeming to have a smart answer to everything. The only aspect I found disappointing was the end, it felt rushed & was the only part of the film which seemed routine & unoriginal. Everything is resolved far too quickly, easily & neatly which is a shame because with a better ending Disturbing Behavior would be getting an 8 star review instead of a 7, neither do I think that the film has great repeat appeal. There is a nice foreboding atmosphere throughout it's duration until the aforementioned let down of an ending. There is no blood or gore whatsoever that I could remember apart from a few cuts & scratches but this is a horror film which relies on good storytelling instead of flashy CGI & make-up effect's to maintain interest & entertain it's viewers. A word about the cast now, the acting is fine & Stahl especially puts in a good performance. Director Nutter has an eye for a good looking lady with two in particular that stand out, first Holmes as Rachel is a babe & second Crystal Cass as Lorna Longley who is a stunner as well, these two are real easy on the eyes & provide a very good reason for any red blooded male to give this a go! The familiar face of Steve Railsback makes an appearance in a brief role as does William Saddler. Disturbing Behavior is well made but the IMDb's suggested $15,000,000 budget does seem a little high when you look at what actually ended up on screen, where did all the money go? I didn't think I would but I found Disturbing Behavior really enjoyable & better than a lot of the teen horror that probably swamped it's initial release. I recommend anyone thinking of giving it a go to do so, especially if you can find it cheap or watch it on TV for free as I don't think it is a film that would be watched repeatedly as once you know where the story is going that's it, virtually all of it's effectiveness is gone.

However, this thriller directed by David Nutter who is responsible for the hit science-fiction television series 'X-Files' attempts to imitate a teenage version of 'The Stepford Wives', but suffers from a dull execution and absurdly ineffective thrills. This movie follows young teenager Steve Clark (played by James Marsden) who moves with his family to a coastal town in Ohio after the suicide of his younger brother Allen. Upon arriving at his new school, he meets a few social misfits including Gavin (played by Nick Stahl), U.V, (played by Chad E.

Little does he know, this heinous group has a plan to overrun their town with a sinister plot of brainwashing individuals, and his only hope is the help of Rachel and the eccentric school maintenance man Dorian (played by William Sadler)The basis of the plot is that the students of this mysterious organization have power over pretty much ever social figure including the law enforcement. In one scene, a student from the Blue Ribbon group murder a man at a supermarket and the cops watch and do nothing to intervene. As the title suggests, the movie deals with teenagers who are brainwashed into committing violent and disturbing behavior, but the only thing really disturbing about this movie is how dull and incompetent it is. The film falls in a shallow ground of flaccid thrills and a complete lack of substance, pulling the audience into an atmosphere that is supposed to create a sense of eeriness, but fails to formulate even one effective scare. The scenes of the Blue Ribbon students hunting down the characters try make us believe that that teenagers running around in strange, zombie-like manners or erotically threatening the characters is supposed to be scary, but the results are just weak. And without any suspense or even jump scares to support its tone, what viewers are left with is a total scare-free environment. The biggest redeeming quality may come from the fine performances and a few mildly developed characters. Overall, these are buried under the a painfully executed plot, ineffective scares, and Bruce Greenwood playing a villain that feels all too one-dimensional. Disturbing Behavior is a pretty forgettable film, and an utter disappointment, a movie that had so much potential with David Nutter, the mastermind behind X-Files directing it, but wasted it on such a thrill-free fare.

Mostly known as Katie Holmes first major film role. She had a bit part a year earlier in Ang Lee's The Ice Storm. Disturbing Behavior is directed by David Nutter who mainly directs in television and most notably from episodes of The X files. So you would think this would be the perfect fit right? Wrong.The story centers on Steve one of the newest students to Cradle Bay High School. He is played by James Marsden who looks likes he's about 28 or so. His younger sister Lindsey is played by Katherine Isabelle, who later stars in the 2000 cult favorite movie Ginger Snaps. They have moved to Cradle Bay from Chicago for a new start after their brother had died. Steve gets acquainted with a few of the Cradle Bay outcasts/stoners in Gavin and UV an albino kid. At lunchtime Gavin points out all of the typical high school cliques. The geeks, the motor heads, the skaters and then there are the blue ribbons. The blue ribbons are like the cool kids in a 1950s movie. They are the ultra preppy, letter sweater wearing creeps that really lay on the phony charm just a little too heavy. We are then finally introduced to Rachel or Rae the dark haired, truck driving wanna be bad girl played by Katie Holmes. She is wasted in this role and is pretty much limited to eye candy which is not a bad thing ( just watch The Gift) but she is barely in half the movie, what the hell? After a number of violent outbursts from members of the blue ribbons, who are mostly football players and cheerleaders, Gavin has this theory that some sinister force has taken over the Cradle Bay meatheads as Rachel puts it. This is true and Gavin and Steve are out to stop it, although we are not really sure what it is. While in the boiler room for some reason Steve runs into the apparently crazy and unhinged janitor who is waging war on the schools rat problem. A gigantic WTF. He has cobbled together a sort of high frequency radio box to drive the rats out but wouldn't you know it come up big just as the third act rolls around. This movie is also about the absent parents and their inability to controlled their kids. When an easy but ominous solution comes along the parents all blindly follow it, thinking its for the best.Disturbing Behavior tries to be a lot of things and utterly fails on all fronts.

Its poorly cast and only exists to profit off the teen movie craze of the moment. Even though I rip on it now I did see this in theaters and thought is was alright at the time. It has steadily gotten worse. However if you are so inclined to check it out, even if it only to see Holmes, it's available on DVD and on demand from Amazon.

Some things could have used some fleshing out. Lacking suspense.Final thoughts Hard to believe more than a decade has passed since this film's release. Watching it now certainly brings back memories of that period. It's not a masterpiece, but is also far from being forgettable.

I realized it three minutes into the film while sitting in a theater having bought a ticket that now lines Michael Bay's pocket. Like he needs it. To add salt to my own wounds, I now own The Island on DVD. Relax, I only paid $4.00 for it. Anywho, I was outraged that not one shred of credit was given to the writer of Parts ... Being that Mr. Bay just made a perfect copy of Parts ... with better funding, he falls into a category I call Same Movie- More Money (or, S. M. M. M.). I wouldn't have a problem with this if credit was given where credit is due. After I knew there was a problem I guess a few more people figured it out and eventually the director of Parts ... sued Michael bay and won siting something like 146 similarities. Bully for him!Now that I've gotten that off of my chest, let's continue on to Disturbing Behavior. A fairly complete rip-off of Strange Behavior. They barely changed the title, for Pete's sake. The original title of Strange behavior is Dead Kids, but we couldn't have a movie released in America under THAT title, so we changed it from its original Australian title. So, I'm going to give you, in only MY opinion, what I think the recipe for Disturbing Behavior is. And keep in mind that stuff from above.

It might be a week between viewings or a couple of years may pass, but I always enjoy it. This film isn't great in the sense of a masterpiece, or a seminal moment in the genre, or in originality, or in how the story is told. What it does have is a certain restraint that keeps a fairly dull sounding plot surprisingly interesting. The X-Files influence on the mood and atmosphere is clearly evident, and it's easy to imagine Cradle Bay as some secluded town that Mulder and Scully stumble upon only to discover this mind control plot.One of the highlights of the film is the acting. There's nothing there to blow anyone away, but this is easily one of the best portrayals of teenagers in almost any movie I've seen. There's enough subtlety as to not simply show them as stupid teenagers and insult their intelligence, but there's enough naivet√© and impulsiveness to make the characters believable as teenagers as opposed to the overly introspective or self sufficient characters with hardly a mention of or need for any parents so prevalent in many movies.There is a certain coldness and sterility to the ambiance of Disturbing Behavior, punctuated perfectly by the warmth of the humor and irreverence of our 4 friends as well as the spontaneity of the crazy old janitor. While maybe a little smart for his age, Stahl as Gavin is a pleasure to watch on screen, especially with U.V. as his quiet and quirky sidekick. Marsden as Steve plays the new kid in school down to a tee, keeping a low profile and genuinely trying to find his place in this new world. Holmes is beautiful as Rachel and while her character doesn't serve much purpose other than Steve's love interest and later the damsel in distress, she does a fine job of being just another misfit.The plot can wear thin at times, and Caldecott goes a little too far with his mad scientist persona late in the film, but the film rarely loses it's eerie foothold. The robotic and sometimes psychotic teenagers are fun to watch as well. It's a mundane and tired concept, but it's brought forth in a believable way without becoming hokey. In many respects they are the typical jock; looks great to adults but totally evil to those outside their clique. In Disturbing Behavior we actually have a reason why this kids act in this manner.I don't know that I have much more to say. There isn't a lot about this film to dissect or read into, but it's a pleasure to watch.

James Marsden plays Steve Clark, a new kid in a small town who befriends local outcast Gavin Strick (Nick Stahl). One of the high school cliques Gavin points out to Steve is a bunch dubbed The Blue Ribbons model citizens who've been made that way by the nefarious Dr. Caldicott (Bruce Greenwood). Naturally, Caldicott's scheme has ugly side effects the kids turn homicidal whenever they get turned on, for one thing. Steve teams up with another outcast, Rachel Wagner (Katie Holmes) to foil the mad doctor's scheme. The very brief running time, and fast moving, straightforward story amounts to both a good and bad thing. It ensures that the movie never gets boring, but the lack of a lot of detail, and more meat to the story, will leave some viewers less than satisfied. There's tension in Steve's family because of the suicide of his brother (Ethan Embry, wasted in a nothing part), yet we never find out what drove the brother to do it. The seemingly slow witted janitor Dorian Newberry (William Sadler) is a lot more savvy than he lets on, yet there's no explanation of how he figured everything out. A local policeman, Officer Cox (Steve Railsback) is clearly in on everything, but this role could have been beefed up a little more. (Railsback and Sadler, two solid veterans, also end up somewhat wasted, although Sadler is a bit of a hoot.) It's a good point made that once Gavin, the most engaging of the characters, is given a makeover, the movie definitely loses something. Stahl gives what is the most enjoyable performance in the whole thing. Besides that, the story becomes just a little too conventional in its second half, with a less than truly thrilling conclusion. Despite being meant to be shocking, it comes off as too laughable sometimes. The opening scene does work, though, as does the freak out scene with Lorna (Crystal Cass). The supposedly hip and clever dialogue is just annoying a lot of the time. Viewers will recognize a fair amount of the faces; among them is Katharine Isabelle of the Ginger Snaps franchise as Steve's younger sister. This could have been better, overall, but it's not without some entertainment value; location work is good and the music by 'X-Files' composer Mark Snow is reasonably effective. Six out of 10.

The theatrical edit got utterly butchered in the editing room, where what must have been nearly twenty minutes of scenes were removed from it, leaving it much worse for wear. The DVD includes all of the deleted scenes on the disc (though, sadly, they're not woven into the film itself), as well as the original ending, complete with director's commentary. From what I've heard, the version of the movie that airs on SyFy includes these scenes woven into the film.Now, with that out of the way...Disturbing Behavior is your typical late '90s/early '00s teen horror picture made to capitalize on the success of Scream. Like others of its ilk, it has its share of cringe-worthy totally radical dialogue (Nick Stahl's character is the worst culprit on that front), though fortunately, it doesn't try to copy Scream's hip self-awareness like so many others attempted (and failed) to do. It's pretty well-written and directed for what it's worth, with an X-Files vet helming it and a good, if not terribly original, script (it's pretty much The Stepford Wives in high school). The theatrical cut removed a terrible amount of character development, leaving the cast largely a collection of caricatures (the goth chick, the controlling parents, the stoners, the evil scientist, the crazy guy who knows the truth), but with those scenes included the cast becomes much more fleshed out, becoming much more like actual human beings with thoughts and motivations rather than robots like the film's villains, going through the motions. And I dug the Pink Floyd shout-out during the climax.It's B-movie teen schlock, yeah, but it's the good kind. The original theatrical cut gets a 5 from me due to how thinly written it is, but with the deleted scenes included, I'd bump it up to a strong 7, leaning towards an 8. One thing I didn't understand was how the Blue Ribbon program is supposed to turn troubled teens into moral, upstanding, diligent students, yet they're shown acting like even bigger jerks after their brainwashing, with one of them murdering two people, including a cop, in the opening scene.

Just what we need, another reason for young people to be paranoid about what their parents are planning for them.In theme, Disturbing Behavior can be compared to one of my all time favorite movies, Stanley Kubrick's A Clockwork Orange. It manifest engaging ideas about society and freewill. A Clockwork Orange lunged into the subject with shocking perversity and artistic expression, but Disturbing Behavior lacks exactly what is counterpart explores.Falling captive to conformity and peer pressure from the recent string of popular teen slasher movies, Disturbing Behavior, misses almost every opportunity to provide audiences with satisfying material. It takes the point-of-view of a typical teenager named Steve Clark (James Marsden from X-Men), who doesn't have much time to react to the suicide of his older brother (Ethan Embry) when his family packs their bags and moves to a nice little town called Cradle Bay.Local stoners Galvin (Nick Stahl) and U.V. (Chad E. Donella) greet Steve during his first day at the new high school. A an attractive loner, Rachel (Katie Holmes), predictably snatches Steve's attention. The school's mentally challenged janitor, Dorian Newberry (William Sadler), obsesses about the town's rat population in the basement. All in all, though, Cradle Bay is a pleasant village.But then Galvin rants about the school's elite club, the Blue Ribbons. He think's they're brainwashing all the town's teens. Steve initially thinks nothing of his new friend's paranoia, until he himself discovers the technologically diabolical plans of the school's principal (Bruce Greenwood) the villainous faculty plans to turn all of the local teens into being of sole perfection.This man's idea sure would end half the problems of society, wouldn't it? But just for kicks, lets say that this is a bad thing. And besides, what would the world be like if teens couldn't get themselves into trouble. Think about it all you Mom's and Dad's, a world without trouble making teenagers. Perfect kids. No wonder why so many parents in to movie want their kids to join the Blue Ribbon Club.At the very most, Disturbing Behavior could have been a guilty pleasure. But the film, directed by David Nutter, doesn't even manager to elicit that much gratification. Actually, there's hardly anything remotely pleasing in the entire movie. No thrills. No excitement. No surprises. With the exception of a few moments, this movie is a complete waste of time.Screenwriter Scott Rosenberg conceived a decent concept, but movies are about ideas, not a single good concept. He stretches the individual concept across 84 minutes of movie, and that leads to many problems. There isn't enough conflict to keep audiences interested, and it wastes most of its time filling the scenes with characters roaming the neighborhood.The film does show signs of good ideas hidden deep within, but it doesn't deliver create images out of those ideas. The little juicy material present is but a temptation. When a movie makes us want more, that's great. But when it makes us want more and doesn't deliver, that's not so great. Instead of deliciously initiative situations and sexy surprises, we get scene after scene of bland dialogue. ExampleRachel What now? Steve We go home. Rachel Where's home? Steve Wherever.The film also suffers from casting miscalculations. Although James Marsden, Nick Stahl, and William Sadler support their flat, one-dimensional characters with adequate performances, Katie Holmes and Bruce Greenwood do not fit their characters in the least. Holmes is a fine young actress, but she's not a gothic town rebel, and Greenwood is also a good actor, but he's definitely not a sinister villain.Disturbing Behavior even lowers itself to a level of inconceivable incompetence. It delivers long-awaited love scenes under increasing plausible circumstances. A girl tries to seduce Steve, but instead bashes her own head against a mirror and leaves, before anything takes place. And how about the love scene near the end, where Steve and Rachel make love in the truck. Their town is being ransacked by evil minions, time is of the essence, and they take a time out to make love in a truck. I shouldn't complain, though, because it's the most indulgent scene in the movie.I can't help but to question this film's title. What do they mean by disturbing behavior? There's nothing disturbing about this movie. It's tired, silly, boring hokum. Disturbing behavior? Well, perhaps they are referring the audience's response. I can't say this movie lost money, because with a $17 million gross, and a budget of $15 million, it made enough money to earn a profit. But considering most teen slasher film make title waves at the box office, $17 million isn't all that impressive.

She was doing her best at the time to break free of her good-girl typecast in Dawson's Creek where she played near-perfect Joey. What that means is she grimaces a lot and dresses up in half-shirts and rocker boots.Disturbing Behavior has all the tropes you could ever want in a genre film from the late 1990s. You get over-the-top performances and bad acting mixed with hints of tell-tale talent. A melodramatic electronic soundtrack is mixed well with an alternative rock soundtrack and clothing styles that defined the decade. The lesson to be found in Disturbing Behavior is that you must fight for your identity and individuality. Don't run with the crowd just to be accepted. There's a lot more social commentary here than what you would expect from a Hollywood teen flick.The visual effect used to show the brainwashing really ages the movie as well. They're a sort of fractal imagery that would have looked advanced in a Pre-CGI world, but comes across as hokey today.The movie is rated R for strong violence, sexuality, language, and drug content. There's nudity in a couple of parts and one definite scene suggesting something is going on out of frame. As usual, it's really all needless and might have been the reason the movie wasn't as successful as it could've been were it accessible to a PG-13 crowd. Disturbing Behavior manages to provide some great thrills and chills. The best way to describe it is as a sort of teen slasher mixed with The Stepford Wives and A Clockwork Orange. The ending seems rushed and comes with some cheesy one-line and a tacked - on finale that would lead you to believe they're might be a sequel in the works.

Jason & Ginger Snaps fame) as Steve's sister.The film then reveals the mystery of the film by having Gavin become a member of the Blue Ribbons and to show you very subtly the Janitor knows something is up too.The film then goes to explain that their's this corporation who takes children with odd ,unfavorable & etc, behavior and controls them to doing their biding then it's up for Steve and Rachel to stop it.Now this film is actually very good in my eyes it could've been a masterpiece if everything was left alone in the film tough because of my knowledge on this film a whole bunch of scenes had to be cut for the DVD Home Video release of the film and you could tell because some of the film feels lacking and some of the characters just needed more time to develop.The film's main strength is in how it slowly reveals the intriguing mystery beyond the story it's nice tone and setting and not to mention score.This film also features many similarities to another film of the same year or year before called The Faculty(now I also enjoyed that film) and that begs the question which is the better film we'll that's a hard question because I love both films very much but their must be decided victor between the two so let's dissect the strengths and weaknesses of both films of which they both have The Faculty's strength is more in the characters of which is understandable because that film didn't have to sacrifice so much so for bulls!t reasoning behind the studios and getting to understand their traits and to have some witty Kevin Willamson dialogue in the film.Disturbing Behavior's strength is in it's mythology of the corporation and setting and atmosphere.It is truly sad Disturbing Behavior had to trim down it's character elements because I have a deeper interest in their back-story and the events their going through whereas The Faculty just offered me character development to characters of which I'm not to interested in their story.Disturbing Behavior is a good film regardless just if it was a lot less messed around with it would be a lot better in my eyes.My Next Review will be ofHalloween(2007) coming within a few days of this reviews postage I hope I brought some interesting insight to the film and didn't come off dumb in this review as this is my first review for IMDb.

The movie has a popular cast and an intriguing storyline. This movie is similar to thrillers like The Faculty and Urban Legend. All three of these movies were released in 1998. I personally like The Faculty and Urban Legend better than Disturbing Behaviour. The movie is 1 hour and 24 minutes but the movie should have been more detailed about the plot. Most thrillers are 90 to 120 minutes. If this movie was longer the impact of the movie and box office success of the movie would have been massively increased. I think that The Faculty is more stylish than this movie and Urban Legend is more intense. Urban Legend has more clever plot twists and is similar to Scream in regards to its plot. I liked how the filmmakers took this movie and put their own spin on it. There isn't one moment of the movie I dislike. I feel the movie could have had added depth. Numerous scenes were deleted from the movie that flesh out the characters and they clarify any unanswered questions you may have after watching the theatrical version. Those scenes also add vital information to the plot that isn't in the version that was released. Overall Disturbing Behaviour is an entertaining addition to the eerie teen thrillers that were widely released in cinemas during the 1990's. The movie has an original style and some twists can't be foreseen in the movie. Not all the characters are predictable and every actor has fun with their role. I believe they chose the best actors in the business at the time to act in this movie. Every actor seems like their character, they don't seem like they're acting. I couldn't imagine any other actor playing their roles, if other actors did this movie wouldn't have turned out as well as it did.

He doesn't really fit in with the diverse groups you would expect to find in a typical American high school. Steve looks like one of the jocks, but they don't seem quite right. The jocks seem perfect with their matching jackets, hair cuts, charity work, and perfect behaviour that would make any parent proud. When Steve befriends two social misfits of the school, Gavin and Rachel, he soon discovers why the jocks are so perfect.....It's virtually a remake of The Stepford Wives, with troublesome teens being replaced, or 'upgraded' to be the perfect child. Unfortunately, Rodriguez beat the makers to it with the wonderful The Faculty, which had the good will to be very tongue in cheek, and exploit its B-movie heritage.This film takes itself way too seriously, and spends too much time explaining the maguffin if the film, rather than just going all bonkers like its premise and having fun with it.The cast are okay, but come the end of it, it's just like all the other high school movies that were released in 1999, and when you think about it, there were a stupid amount, and this was one of the poorest.At least Katie Holmes is easy on the eye.Boring stuff, otherwise....

The director puts unintentionally funny things where there should be chills, or intrusive rock music that completely jarrs with the mood of the film.  Mark Snow's score is good (it reminded me of Moby) but a chunk of gold in a pile of crap is still mostly crap.Holmes is her usual sassy self, put in tight clothes to keep at least the male audience watching when the plot deteriorates (hey, it worked on me). Stahl is amusing, but vanishes halfway through, leaving it to James Marsden to carry things.  Marsden is a nice guy but he barely registers.This isn't the worst teen-horror you'll ever see, but it could have been better and considering Robert Rodriguez's superior teen-horror 'The Faculty' came out the same year (with suspicious similarities), this merely comes off as its weaker cousin.

Some have put down Marsden's acting.  But watch the deleted scene where he describes what happened with his brother.The editing made many holes in the story.  Someone commented that directors should learn to reign in their editors.  If you listen to the director's commentary you *know* he really wanted the original (and far superior) ending.  He said that directors sometimes do not have control.  I assume that he is referring to the powers of the studio that want to make the movie into a cookie cutter image of the standard fare.Even with the deleted scenes restored, the presentation of the means of transformation from regular kid to blue ribbon kid was quite thin and hard to believe.  I agree with another's comment that the psychiatric hospital was really bad.  It looks like a 19th century bedlam.  I might be wrong but I believe they don't let patients get this way anymore.I've seen DVD's that provide more than one version of a film by doing something with the linking of scenes together.  It is too bad they didn't make this one so that we could see the original cut. I try not to take these kind of flics too seriously.  I enjoy many more films that way.

This is a film that I believe was intended to wake kids up. It's no artistic venture, I know. It's all laid out in a very simple fashion, and was made for the MTV kids to be able to understand it. Still, the point is a great one, and was carried out well. After reading someone's review of this, I have to say I was enraged. The good guys sometimes smoke pot in this. Would it be worse if they were on crack? Yes, it would. The good guys look a little freaky most of the time. Would it make them better people if they wore nice clothes? No, it wouldn't. They cuss a lot and talk their weird, poetic jive. Would they be more interesting if they didn't? No, they would be LESS interesting. The good guys like rock music. Does that make them bad, scary kids? Absolutely not, because you can't judge a person solely on their tastes. And as for the brainwashed psycho kids that even a lot of kids nowadays would root for, they break people's necks because they're ashamed to be sexually aroused. Is that less scary than a kid who just wants to get laid and can't because he's viewed as a monster by society? If your answer is yes, you are obviously very disturbed yourself. This movie is about the underdogs, those people who are good people but have no choice other than to fight when so many would rather oppress them for being who they really are. This hardens and depresses them considerably, and why shouldn't it? The world is not a Mister Rogers' Neighborhood, and, though that is a nice fantasy, this movie, despite any fantastic contexts it might have, is full of harsh realities. If there's a world full of Blue Ribbons, things wouldn't be exciting to you unless you're totally brainwashed. If you're not, that makes it scary. That's why this movie sends chills up my spine, no matter how simple and MTV-styled it might be. This is one of the best horror films of the 1990s. At least it's not junk like I Know What You Did Last Summer. This film has something to say, something only severely distorted people would see as completely negative and wrong.

Even in such a state, this movie did nothing for me. It was a great idea that kinda fell flat. The only naturally disturbed character was Allan Parker (Ethan Embry), the lead's suicide-victim brother. Now, was this storyline supposed to be related to the whole brainwashing thing, or was it one of those plots you only wished would be related to the actual movie? A whole movie could have been made out of that character, and it would have been a lot better if there was a connection. Instead it just explained why the family moved.

The story made sense, but it seemed that there was more that they just didn't want to show us. So I investigated, and there indeed were many scenes that were left out of the film. Some include Gavin breaking into the morgue to find the dead girl's body, Steve's parents finding the gun he stole from Gavin, a scene which includes Katie Holmes and James Marsden hooking up, and more. These scenes have great importance in the story line. Why were they taken out? To save time? Lots of movies run over two hours. They could've taken out some other less important scenes other than the ones they left on the cutting room floor. The original also had a different ending, (which you can see on the DVD.)*Warning spoliler* Gavin originally shows up on the boat just as Steve thinks he's safe, and UV ends up having to shoot his best friend in order to save everyone. (As opposed to Gavin becoming a student teacher at another school and starting the perfect kids all over again.)The tension begins when Steve (James Marsden, X-Men) and his family, after the tragic suicide of his brother (Ethan Embry, Empire Records), move to the small town of Cradle Bay. Steve tries to find a place in his new school and ends up making friends with two pot heads, one of which is a paranoid named Gavin (Nick Stahl, In the Bedroom) that's certain the perfect jocks and cheerleaders are lobotomized, and the other is an albino nicknamed UV. Steve soon meets Gavin's punk friend, Rachel (Katie Holmes, Teaching Mrs. Tingle,) and falls hard. Gavin tries to convince him that the perfect kids, called the Blue Ribbons, are out to get everybody that they consider bad, (smoking, drinking, and sex are big no-no's.) Not believing any of Gavin's paranoia stories, Steve is offered the chance to become a Blue Ribbon, but after Gavin suddenly disappears and returns to school as a totally different person, Steve starts to believe what Gavin was scared of is actually real. Aided only by Rachel, UV, and the school janitor, Mr. Newberry, (a former friend of Gavin's that knows more than what he admits,) Steve must try to stop the Blue Ribbons before they take over. This is a great thriller. The acting was done fairly well. Thumbs up to Nick Stahl and William Sadler, (Mr. Newberry,) for their great performances. Some of the other characters needed more development, but I think the scenes that were cut out would've helped in that department. All-in-all, this was a fun movie. I gave it *******/10.

It has plot holes that the biggest human being in the world could jump through. It moves along at an uneasy pace and at 83 minutes it isn't much of a movie. However, this isn't the filmmakers fault. Blame the studio that released the film. They basically ordered him to cut everything that made the movie make sense and what we got to see was a studio hack job.The Dvd on the other hand is another story. It provides at least 20 minutes of deleted scenes and when you watch them along with the rest of the movie everything begins to make sense and it makes me grow a new-found appreciation for the film. It isn't cinematic gold but when you look at what the film was like before it may just look like a masterpiece.The premise is pretty unique. In Cradle Bay failure and misbehaving is a no no. You wil be perfect....or else.

The blue ribbons appear to be perfect with their good grades and bake sales but beneath the surface lies a mal-function that makes them act violently.What I LikedThe character of Gavin in both versions of this film remains intact. I completely loved this character and he's played really well y Nick Stahl. I was quite impressedAll the Blue Ribbons are creepy as hell. It's like they came out of an acid-induced version of leave it to beaver or the Brady Bunch.i like the general idea of the film.

It honestly explains so much and it raises the films level from crap to about average.What I Didn't LikeThe theatrical release is filled with mistakes. It's too short, the pacing is off, and it ends on a pretty sour note. There are no redemming aspects of this version except for the character of Gavin.The scene in the insane asylum was pretty dumb. I don't expect much realism out of these films but this was above and beyond being real.The characters with the exception of Gavin don't really fit their roles. I didn't by James Marsden as a hero.

Unfortunately, this movie was sadly hijacked from its director and had most of its life whittled out, as about 20 minutes of essential explication and character development were expunged by a studio that no doubt was trying to sell this one as a typical teen movie to the lowest common denominator. The truth of the matter is that Disturbing Behavior was unfairly lumped into the post-scream self-aware horror mold, and was bunched together with drivel like the I know what you did last summer and Teaching Ms. Tingle sorts of junk. The fact that David Nutter's background has been primarily in X-File's episodes should give you some idea of where this movie's really coming from a paranoid sci-fi suspenser, somewhat of an update on The Stepford Wives.From this perspective the film is interesting. It's approach is fairly original and fresh, and the acting in general is decent, with a few strong performances, mostly from the adult actors like William Sadler and Bruce Greenwood, but Nick Stahl is also excellent in the most sympathetic role in the movie. The truth of the matter is that in it's theatrical form however, this film is deeply flawed. It is superficial, lacking character development, and if glossed into a horror mold, not scary. Adding the missing footage to the movie (which is on the DVD. USA has also been playing the full version surprisingly) changes things substantially. Character's like William Sadler's janitor, who is a confusing enigma in the original version, is seen in greater depth, and Bruce Greenwood's villain is given an excellent scene where he essentially lies to himself about the fate of his daughter. This scene adds a great deal of depth and humanity to his character, instead of making him seem like simply some deranged doctor. Anyways, the point is, Disturbing Behavior is only an OK film in its original form, but that's through no fault of its own. In it's longer form, the film is interesting, and is an effective small-scale almost noir-ish classic (the much more dour ending adds a great deal of gravity to this film). Leonard Maltin called this film teen-targeted dreck, and it's possible to view the short version of this film in that light if viewed in a cursory fashion. In the way it should have been shown, however, it has the makings of a small-scale cult film. Short version = 5/10 long version = 8/10 "},{"Title":"Disturbing? Sure!

It ranges from entertaining to average to totally laughable and ends up being somewhere in the middle but not far from the bottom of the barrel. None of the performances stick out really, maybe except Nick Stahl's as the very literate over-paranoid Gavin who gives the audience a surprise at the end. The direction shines only in the scene of the psychiatric hospital, and the script is muddled with what its trying to achieve. Its nice to see Katie Holmes in a different light and in heaps of sexy tops, and the cool soundtrack is refreshing, but neither can save what this movie really misses out on plot build-up, thrilling sequences, a good running time and atmosphere to its moody and interesting premise. Disturbing Behavior is average when it doesn't take itself too seriously, it's good when it tries hard and is downright awful when no effort goes into thinking how the audience will react.

And it seemed like they knew she did smashed her head into the mirror because of the Blue Ribbon club. That's another thing that bothered me, if the Blue Ribbon club hated everyone that wasn't one of them, why did two of them have crushes on people outside the club?

A film, whose idea is truly original, is so bad that you deserve to kick yourself if you went to see it in theaters.  Granted, it looked interesting with some cool trailers and the overkill of that Harvey Danger song, (which, in a form of major hypocrisy, isn't even on the soundtrack!) James Marsden is Steve, a new student to Cradle Bay High, a high school overriddled with extreme stereotypes of high school groups that is on the border of total parody. Marsden ends up meeting with three fellow outcasts named Rachel, Gavin, and U.V. (played by Katie Holmes, Nick Stahl, and Chad Donella respectively), all poster children for the  I-really-hate-high-school deadhead group, a group that is diminishing by the minute because of the sudden shift in image change for a group of exceptional teacher's pets, kids who are officers in the honor society, play football, hold bake sales, and spend a majority of their days at the malt shop basking in the image of the American Dream. Unfortunately, such a thing isn't good when Gavin suspects that this group of kiss asses also has psychotic tendencies that includes murdering people, self inflicted abuse, and recruitment tactics that involve groups of them vs. one. I rented this on DVD and it's really strange how the film, watered down, is surprisingly low on chills, action, and very much story. It's nothing more than an after school special on acid. Directed by former X-Files helmer David Nutter, it does in fact feel like a bad X-Files episode. The DVD has eleven deleted scenes, every one of them are essential to the film's plot, that were cut from the film. Including an alternate ending that would've defeated the cliched sellout of a poor excuse for an ending that results in the bad guy coming back (Oops! Did I ruin that for you? Good, you'll thank me). It's going to remain a mystery but the theory is, that MGM, the studio behind this tepid piece of celluloid waste, wanted to change it to a summer film when they released it at the beginning of the summer by extracting any mention of thought and replacing it with shallow suspense scenes. With books, you've got to delve right into the middle of things, but for movies, you've got to start at the beginning of a plot and move forward. Disturbing Behavior goes into the middle of things.

A misguided mentality that some hold that they are the sole problem with today's world. No matter how blatantly biased that opinion is. That's what Disturbing Behavior touched on for me. Kids who sometimes have to rebel against the system who wants them to be all the same. Cut from cookie cutter molds. Disturbing Behavior tries to tackle this issue while it throws an assortment of scares and heavy doses of paranoia your way. It's not deep, expanded or given time to breath, it's more of a backdrop, soon forgotten, but the workings are there.It's onto something. It's also this 'something' that it seems obvious got a knife taken to it in the editing room. The movie is somewhat uneven and with a running time of 84 minutes I can only assume how much was cut. Still even with the uneven editing and bumpy pacing the underlying concept behind the movie succeeded in winning me over. It's different enough from what I expected it to be (pretentious teen slasher flick) that I couldn't help but enjoy it. The principle cast actually acquit themselves quite well too.

Disturbing Behavior demonstrates how this illusion masked the sexual stirrings and violent emotions that exist within every young person.The film pits the two conflicting stereotypes together, with only one expected to survive the outcome. The victor guaranteed to decide the fate of American schools.There are sub-characters representing various elements to schooling and education. A teacher more concerned with his students than the well-being of his own daughter and a janitor who turned his back on the supposed virtue of intellect. A poor individual with worryingly pale skin, clearly symbolic of being the ultimate outcast, never to be wanted by the perfect Blue Ribbon group.The hero figure, the new-boy, yet to create an identity by fitting into one of the cleverly laid out social groups. His indefinable nature makes him the ultimate in ensuring his freedom and continued individuality.This film seems to be deeply concerned with the workings of the teenage mind and proves to be a thriller shifting in tension and ideals.Far superior than a bigger budget counterpart such as 'The Faculty' if not for the commanding performance of Katie Holmes, clearly chosen for being identified as the wholesome Joey Potter of Dawson Creek, here she is now transformed into the dark and grungy heroine, who's morals and virtues aren't so easily worn on her sleeve.Disturbing Behavior demonstrates how the questionable teenage morality of the new millennium ensures teenagers' individualism.

Both deserve better material than this.  I'm sure Scott Rosenberg's original screenplay gave it to them, so I'm guessing the fault here lies with the producers.  What were they thinking?

Plus, I'd just seen The Faculty, which while not good, wasn't too bad.  But this movie disappointed me, because it had so much potential then through it away.  I agree with many of the other comments that suggested the makers of this film needed to focus more on certain aspects of the story, e.g., why the parents were consenting to this, the whole bit about Steve's brother, etc.  I wanted to know why Steve's parents bought into the whole thing, given that Steve didn't seem too badly adjusted at all; and was the whole point of moving to this town to fix Steve in the first place? Also, if the point of this surgery/brainwashing thing is to make kids good, why does everyone seem to accept that the Blue Ribbons tend to do nasty, even lethal things? That strikes me as wrecking kids, not fixing them.  See other comments for a whole bunch more ridiculous, implausible, or ambiguous thins that are wrong with this film.On the whole, the acting was pretty mediocre, although I'm not sure if that was really a result of the acting or of the horrible dialogue; I suspect it was a bit of both, because the character of Gavin didn't come off as too ridiculous, and yet he had some of the stupidest lines to say. While I do appreciate the fact that the writer has an extensive vocabulary, it did not seem right for some words and phrases to be pouring from the mouths of these teenagers.  I appreciate that every second word was not f@ck or some derivative.  But in a movie about teenagers, the teens should talk like teens, not like English Literature professors.  Aside from the sometimes gratuitous use of ten-point words, the dialogue was also often stilted and forced, which contributed to a sense that this whole movie was just unbelievable and ridiculous.I would be interested in seeing the DVD version of this film to see what was cut out, because there really did seem to be glaring holes in the film; why on earth would anyone cut a film down to only 84 min? What is this, some Saturday Night Live skit brought to the big screen? It had about as many laughs...Anyway, this film was poorly executed.  It should have been better.  And that's about all there is to say.  If you choose to watch this film, try not to let your expectations get too high.

But unlike the rest, this one is totally different to the other slasher films around. This horror flick is more of a mind flick, were your thinking and you see what's happening to the town. That's what makes this stand out among the other horror movies of the 90's it didn't go with the slicing and dicing of other horror movies, but built up the plot and the characters.  The story revolves around a small town were teens are getting operations that make them act really nice, but sometimes they malfunction and lash out in rage. One particular kid is being targeted to join the group but he and his friends know something is going on.  A very good film, and worth the watch. many horror fans may not like it because there isn't the violence and killings like in I know What You Did Last Summer or Scream but this still is a great movie.

I was fairly surprised at how wrong i was. while taking place in a highschool with teenagers made it seem like a teen movie, it really was the only way the plot could've come off. The same thing happend in A Clockwork Orange, how Alex was supposedly a troubled teen. Now saying that, I can tell you that the more i watch it the more i like it. Most of the movies aimed at teens today would've shown The Blue Ribbons as the good guys. I was happy to see that it wasn't another pointless love story where either the poor guy gets a rich girl or vice versa. This was actually a movie with a plot, a good representation of kids in school today, and Katie Holmes... oh come on, you knew it was coming. Anyway, this movie is good fun with an eerie sense of A Clockwork Orange directed by John Hughes. And i also like all the hidden punk references like the NOFX sticker on Katie Holmes' truck and a couple of shirts people were wearing.

I've heard of a similar plot in the form of A Clockwork Orange where a criminal is reformed through application of science.  You get a fear of losing your individuality, that is what makes you who you are.   The story runs like an X-file episode sans Mulder and Scully.  I guess that's because the director has done a few X-files episodes and the music here is made by Mark Snow.  The movie leaves a lot of questions most of which could have helped to make this a better movie.  Why is Caldicott convinced that his method is the right way?  How much do the parents know about the program?  What do other teens think of the Blue Ribbon?  How is the sheriff part of the conspiracy?  Why is the janitor pretending to be dumb?  How did the entire Blue Ribbon team fit into the pickup truck near the end of the movie?There are also times where I have a hard time getting the dialogue.  Especially Nick Stahl's character and that albino.  How come he's albino anyway?  Is it the actor himself?  If so, I have nothing against him but his character is more of an outcast than Steve Marsden's character.  He simply stands out and we still don't know anything about him by movie's end.  The ending makes you wonder though.The verdict 2.5 of 5 stars.

The idea has promise, the subtext is relevant (quite often, the 'perfect in-crowd' are the most vicious and reprehensable ones of all, and people who are so perfect just HAVE to go nutty in some way, some time!), the soundtrack was fun, the setting was perfect (little isolated island).  So what went wrong?Well, what bugged me most was the attempt at inventing a Heathers-esque teen language, which kept on intruding in some of the best scenes.  I'd find myself wondering, what the heck did she just say?  'Sounds RIZZO?' ('razor' apparently, but still, it sounds stupid).  Not to mention some really, really terrible dialogue.  In the first five minutes I was subjected to Self-mutilate this, fluid-boy.  Oh jeez, nobody would ever say that, unless they were in a bad teen movie.As well, too many things were left out what's the deal with Steve's brother?  What about the parents of these implanted teens, what do they have to say?  What about Caldicott's background, what's his motivation?  Why does the janitor pretend to be crazy (for self-preservation, of course, but this is never really stated)?   How does somebody--who's perfected his 'Boo Radley' act enough to fool everybody--just slip up and leave a Vonnegut novel sticking out of his pocket?  (And who's to say, of course, that no Boo's read Vonnegut) How did they break into the mental hospital in the first place?  What do the other teens in the school think of all these shenanigans?That said, there were lots of fine moments...Caldicott's daughter, for instance, and any scene featuring the oh-so-charming Chug.  But overall, it was a pretty 'ooky' movie  great premise, terrible execution, though entertaining enough to sit through and enjoy to some extent.  The random violence is effective, the janitor and Gavin are always fun to watch, and there's enough tension to keep you wondering what's going to happen next.The biggest tragedy, of course, is that they didn't do more with what they had.  (And maybe this is a Canadian thing, but I can't see Terry David Mulligan in a scene without thinking of Zig Zag,.So see it, but expect very little, and you'll be entertained enough if you can overlook the gigantic flaws.

The story didn't attract me and seemed very boring. But I found it worse than my expectations. This movie is horrible.First of all, the screenplay is very bad. All the cast are in their worst performance and the soundtrack is bad too. Everything is bad! They tried to do one movie that should cost at least 40 million dollars spending 15 million! You can see it in the scene where they try to transform Steve (James Marsden) and Rachel (Katie Holmes) in Blue Ribbons. Only Universal Soldier can be as ridiculous as this scene. And they should had explored the story of Steve's family before moving to Cradle Bay, specially the suicide of Adam (played by Ethan Embry. He's nice and could appear a bit more).In fact their idea was a bit interesting. A story about one guy that moved to a small city were a lot of teenagers are 'perfect'. They get good marks, help old people, don't have any vice or bad habit (smoking, drinking)... These people are the Blue Ribbons. But this perfection was suspicious for Gavin and then for Rachel and Steve. So they try to discover what's really happening. Katie Holmes is not in a good performance too but she has charism (and beauty), what made me enjoy a little the movie while she was in the screen. Her great acting in Go and Dawson's Creek compensates this disaster.3 out of 10. It would be 1 without Kate.

Thanks to smart and atmospheric direction of David Nutter and a DVD release that restores what studio chiefs made him trim, DISTURBING BEHAVIOR lives up to it's name. Fresh from directing TV's X-FILES, Nutter coaxes stellar performances from his three leads Katie Holmes (DAWSON'S CREEK), hunk with heart James Marsden (BELLA MAFIA), and real find Nick Stahl (THE THIN RED LINE) as the misfit in the know. Unlike similar flicks set squarely in hormone-driven senior high, this film is nearly always honest and watchable, even when it's premise of brain-chip improved Stepford teens (Whatever happened to subplot Mr. Producer?) fails to buoy this enticingly shot thriller.  Only in a slightly over the top turn by Bill Sadler as Newberry (as a janitor turned Pied Piper) and an indulgent madhouse scene that feels like it was meant for another movie, does Nutter's well-thought-out film threaten to derail. As was evident on the DVD release of Kevin Smith's sophmore flop MALLRATS, studio mandated cuts (amended to the digital package) may have made the difference between profit and loss on this, Nutter's debut feature. Best work from all three principals as well as a less Hollywood (but somehow less interesting) ending were left on the cutting room floor, so don't skip the Special Features button.  DISTURBING BEHAVIOR is a rare thing - a well-wrought teenage thriller!

This film lacks so much that it is a waste of time just trying to list all of the problems, so I will list three that really missed the mark.1. A credible story - Does a film like this really need a credible story? Well lets just say that a retarded character was thrown into the plot just so he could eventually save the day. It is quite lame. The whole film revolves around a doctor/teacher and his ploy to implant computer chips into teens (with full parental agreement, of course), however, why he wants to do this isn't at all clear. These chips supposedly make the teens better all-around students, yet they beat up on those who aren't like them and have steroid-like fits when they are sexually aroused? Yeah, I didn't get it either. Don't look for hidden meanings here because you won't find any.2. The acting - If this film was designed as a Katie Holmes vehicle, it doesn't do anything to make her seem like a real actress. 90% of the time she is brooding around for no particular reason and almost seems to have an instant change at the end of the film. The male leads do well with what unchallenging roles they have and yet it all still seems too fake.3. The ending - Without trying to give too much away, let's just say that all is tied up too quickly and conveniently. There is no sense of fear or loss which means there can be no redemption with the finale. Whoever wrote this film deserves to be slapped for their complete disregard for an ending.Two other quick points I must discuss are the all-of-a-sudden love interest between the Holmes character and Steve. I haven't seen such fakery since Six Days, Seven Nights. I also found the stereotypes presented here to be as fake as the kiss at the end. Nerds are shown full out with glasses and computers. Skaters with long hair and baggy pants and jocks of course in full preppy attire. For once could a teen flick not showcase such an obvious disregard to reality. Who thinks these groups up, Dan Quayle?Don't waste your time with this film like I did.4/10 stars.

I wouldn't exactly call it a horror but it has been clumped together under this broad teen horror category. Anyways it's about a small town in Cradle bay whose residents use mind control on the 'bad' kids to turn them into the 'good' kids or 'blue ribbons'. This mind control is not without its side-effects and it is particularly noted that when a blue ribbon gets horny they are uncontrollable.  Enter new family from out of town, in particular Steven who falls in with a bunch of 'bad' kids. This group including Gavin, U.V (pigmentally challenged) and Rachel (Katie Holmes from Dawsons Creek) suspect that something is up but only Gavin knows for sure. Anyway blah blah blah Gavin gets converted the rest go into action. They win and live happily ever after. Well what more did you expect from a teen/horror movie?

Actually this movie is not as bad as all those sequels to the great horror flicks of the 80's, but it falls way short of Scream and even I Know What you did last Summer. It definitely has its moments, Nick Stahl pretty much walks off with the movie, while James Marsden comes across as a very bland.

(Cozy Community with a secret to Hide is a much better subtitle!) Starring Jimmy Marsden, Katie Holmes, Nick Stahl, Ethan Embry, and Bruce Greenwood. Troubled Teens?  I don't think so.  It's the constant battle between the science misfits (some jerk who sips from the petri dish and thinks up ways to bring himself to the top of the crowd by controlling everyone else.) S(he) usually needs some commando force and a bunch of whiney people with a little cash flow.  The theme is akin to The Stepford Wives (and sequels), and someone in the writing of this film definitely has a negative message to the Blue Ribbon Schools here in California!  If you didn't figure that out until you got to my review and you live in Southern California, shame on you. After experiencing the death of their oldest son, a very needy mother and father pack up their two surviving teen children and ship with them (literally) off to Cradle Bay. Steve (James Marsden) is a high school sophomore (who has taken his older brother's death real hard. First day of school jitters are gone, and the reality of this mind altering school body is introduced through the very astute perception of Gavin (Nick Stahl) and then he meets his new buds,  U.V. (Chad Donella) and Rachel (Katie Holmes). These three travel down the road to survival until one of them inevitably bites the mind control bug.  Best line of the movie Hey Teacher! Leave those kids alone! from the very skillful, conspiracy theory exposer janitor who appears to be the only one breaking all the rules! If you sat through this movie trying to make connections to Scream, Village of The Damned, or you thought Hollywood was once again picking on teens, you lost a lot in the translation.  See it again.

Despite the slasher elements, it's more of a paranoid thriller. In that it succeeds, though perhaps not as well as it could uncut.The world of Cradle Bay is one where conformity buys the right to impunity in violence, where the high school social hierarchy holds all the deadly force of a grown-up power structure, and the lines of attack are the standard divisions of the American society. Uniting the coercion of a street gang with the ideals of principals and parents, the dominant clique of Cradle Bay is allowed to get away with murder, at least with victims who are seen as unworthy of protection, characterized as sluts and retards.Where Disturbing Behavior falls short is in making its themes clear. The conflicting desire/condemnation that the blue ribbons hold for Katie Holmes' character is inarticulately portrayed, as is the desire/self-repression that leads one character to attack herself. Above all, the movie misses the chance to make its interesting point about acceptable violence explicit. Without anything paranormal, here in the real world, high schoolers are beaten for being gay, for being socially different, and both raped and attacked when they are seen as promiscuous. This movie is so fascinating because it takes those impulses to an absurdly exaggerated level and forces characters to talk about them. The sad thing is that except for Gavin, very few characters manage to do so effectively.Incidentally, for an interesting comparison, see the 1-hour film The Wave, a TV movie loosely based on a social studies teacher's experiment creating a conformist organization within his class; and experiment which got a bit out of control.

I thought Marsden and Holmes were okay, not bad for early in their careers, and I'm certain they will have many more opportunities to showcase their talent.  However I think the pairing of their characters made little, if any, sense.  The subplot about Steve's dead brother seemed like there should be more of a tie-in, like the movie was edited one too many times.  I never really understood where the film was trying to go with the flashbacks to his brother.  The scene, though, that really removed me from this film was the one in the psychiatric institution. Not only was the institution horribly stereotyped as a Gothic, rundown dungeon, but the patients were comical in their portrayals.  I understand that the director was trying to show the horror of the mind experiments, but what was meant to be horrifying was so overplayed it ended up making me laugh.  In my opinion this sequence alone turned the movie from a little above average one to no more than a 4 out of 10.The genre of teen slasher flicks that was reincarnated with the brilliant Scream and Scream 2 has gone swiftly downhill.  Each movie is now the same basic thing, except for slightly different, but equally predictable, plots.

I think that a lot of the people who didn't like the movie were expecting something other than what the movie promised. Before seeing the movie, I looked at a couple of Disturbing Behavior websites.  They made it clear that the movie was NOT some sort of slasher horror film, but more of a suspense/thriller/sci-fi/horror movie.  Remember that a true horror movie has nothing to do with slashers and gore.  Disturbing Behavior presents a scenario that, if you think about it, is horrifying.  It's a concept that is a bit unrealistic (like a sci-fi movie) , but at the same time doesn't seem so removed from reality.  Basically, I found the movie to be ...disturbing.  That's just what I expected, and I was not disappointed by anything.  If it helps any, the theater I saw it in was filled with 16-26 year olds (mostly 16-19).  They were all so involved and mystified by the movie that they were silent throughout almost the whole movie (except for laughs and gasps) even though they were loud and annoying during all all the previews and the first few minutes of the movie.

Where it suffered was in the execution. Taking a creepy approach to themes of conformity, loss of identity, and the quest for perfection, combined with social satire of behavioral issues of controlling teenagers, the film never really took off. Instead of exploring these ideas, the film degenerates into a generic uncovering a sinister plot and chase scenario. Nowhere are these themes really brought up, much less reflected upon. The film is remarkably short and doesn't even seem interested much in exploring the horror of this situation. There are plenty of character threads and concepts set up early on, but they are neglected in favor of a breezy, quick-cut-to-the-next-scene attitude.

The family enrolls the children in Cradle Bay High School. Predictably, the high school is full of obviously older actors cast as teenagers. Oddly, Mr. Marsden finds it difficult to fit in with his peers, especially a group of do-gooders called the Blue Ribbons, who swear off sex, drugs, and rock and roll music. Instead, Blue Ribbons save their juices, eat yogurt, and listen to Wayne Newton and Barry Manilow music.Marsden does connect with grungy stoner Nick Stahl (as Gavin Strick). Mr. Stahl thinks some form of mind-control is infecting the town. Stahl has witnessed some mysterious behavior (the film's opening shocker); he tells Marsden; but, Marsden thinks Stahl's just a tweaked, paranoid druggie. Through Stahl, Marsden meets hot, slim-waisted Rachel Wagner (who moved from Dawson's Creek to Cradle Bay). Ms. Wagner and Marsden form the obligatory romantic twosome; they pose, and perform, well together. However, the superior role, and performance, is Stahl's Gavin; he is the most normal acting of the lot, on or off drugs.Filming in Canada, David Nutter and John Bartley make Disturbing Behavior look way better than expected; there are quite a few nice location scenes. And, you have to like the high school janitor, with Kurt Vonnegut's Slaughterhouse-Five in his hip pocket. It would have been nice to see more of that part of the story; perhaps, with Stahl and William Sadler setting up a resistance and/or investigation center in the high school basement. And, more close-ups of Steve Railsback's Officer Cox. The film too suddenly becomes A Clockwork Orange, then Terminator; and, the ending just makes you wish Stahl had more participation.****** Disturbing Behavior (1998) David Nutter ~ James Marsden, Rachel Wagner, Nick Stahl "},{"Title":"It's not disturbing","Date":"5 October 2006","Score":"","Genre":"Horror, Mystery, Sci-Fi","Review":" After his family moves into town, Steve starts to notice that there are some bizarre kids at school - pretty much always friendly and smiling... unless they are in a blind fit of blood thirsty rage...

Soon, a secret that is only mildly disturbing is uncovered.This film would have fared much better if it were a TV episode and seeing that a TV director is responsible for this film we can see it is so mediocre. The decent premise, perfect for an X-Files episode, is stretched out over an hour and twenty minutes (pretty short for a movie) and the good moments are far in between if apparent at all. The highlight of the film would have to be the admittedly intriguing premise, but the way it is presented is just poor. The DVD has 11 deleted scenes and the director could really have cut more off to make a tighter and story, which like mentioned before, could have fared well on the X-Files.

Rather than attempt to be the usual teen scare flick, this film relies far more on its brooding, paranoid atmosphere to be compelling and it works. The subject matter alone is enough to stir chills without having to resort to bloody violence. Still there's a fair amount of action to be had in this unsettling tale. David Nutton's direction is well-handled and the filming locations are beautiful. Mark Snow's music score is also nicely moody, and there's a slick rock soundtrack to boot.The cast is also pretty good. Katie Holmes is fetching as a rebel girl. Nick Stahl is likable as a teen stoner. Best of all though is star James Marsden as our heart-felt hero.It's easy to dismiss Disturbing Behavior as just another teen thriller, but it packs more intelligence than most of its kind.

As a few others have also noted, this film is pretty much just a rip-off of Body Snatchers, with a psychotic super-intelligent scientist/teacher in place as the villain, instead of aliens. The plot barely makes sense at all... something about some kind of operation that turns normal teenagers into controllable monsters. I think what really bothered me with this film was the fact that they had to be monsters, that there just had to be tagged on that they were rapists and killers. What about making them empty, soulless individuals through the process of removing all human emotions and reactions? Why do they have to be psychotic, as well? Dang, here the director/scriptwriter could have made a great point; is it worth it to be intelligent, smart and in every way perfect, if you're empty? Instead they go for something every teenager can see, by putting some nudity and various references to sex in it, and stuffing it full of violence and tension. Like running down a hallway or being beaten up in the dining hall is tense... come on, how many American teens don't go through that every single day? The acting is decent. The characters are paper-thin, for the most part. The script is tame and predictable. The horror/thriller parts are for the most part ineffective and either over- or underdone. The whole premise is so far-fetched that it's hard to explain. Another thing that really bothered me was how the film was so... teenage-flick-like. Every major character is a teen, it's set at a high school, the villain is an adult... come on. No one over the age of 17-18 could enjoy this movie, and the directors obviously did what they could to make sure of this fact. Why? Why limit the film to one particular audience? Why not throw some social commentary and some interesting characters into it as well, in order to capture older audiences, or even more critical members of the teenage audience(like yours truly, for example). It would have taken such a small ounce of further work. But alas, it was not to be. Instead the film is limited to teenagers with short attention spans. I think the most disappointing thing is that while the film could have offered some very clever social commentary and proved some good points, it's reduced to a typical teen horror flick that's forgotten before the ending credits have rolled past the screen. It's a shame, I tell you. A damn shame. I recommend this only to teenage fans of teenage horror flicks who don't expect too much from it. Anyone else should probably just skip this. A thoroughly weird movie bordering on being nonsensical garbage. Has one or two interesting elements and scenes, apart from that, a waste of time. 6/10 "}{"Title":"Disturbingly Real","Date":"26 June 2004","Score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Horror, Mystery, Sci-Fi","Review":"  I'll keep this short no one is ever going to accuse this movie of taking Casa Blanca's seat as the reigning best movie of all time; however, the movie did do a few things incredibly well.First off, the first time I saw this film I entered it in media res - or in the middle of the action. The fact that James Marsden was playing a really good role as a frustrated outsider (a stretch in itself) was refreshingly surprising. As with any movie about High School rejects, there inevitably comes the point where the leading protagonist(s) must confront the parents; in this particular case there was a disturbingly realistic conflict between Marsden's frustrated character and his parents. I truly believe (especially after seeing it again) that this is the emotional core of the film. As with any good low budget attempt to dazzle and scare, the best surprises and shocks are generated through good psychology - not special effects. Here, watching the rawness of Marsden's edging frustrations about striving to be normal and his parents' standard of acceptance really rings true to the 12-26 year-old audience.Secondly, the movie lives up to its title in the enigmatic blue ribbon kids; it's not the behavior per se that shocks, it's the violence and suddenness of their mood swings that create the real suspense within the film. Nothing generates good fear like the unpredictable, and to the film's credit, there were many, many times where I didn't know what was going to happen next. The madness that overtakes some of the tuned-up kids is a little too close sometimes to actual cases of dementia and psychosis. This movie can be a LOT scarier than something like Texas Chainsaw or a Freddy movie because the main protagonists are not necessarily sociopaths who simply disregard the difference between right and wrong; they're borderline psychotics who slowly blur the difference until they can no longer make the distinction. In the heat of the moment, with the general suddenness and extreme nature of the violence, and the blatant humanity of the characters (or lack of supernatural or fantastic elements) the movie gets realistic fast.Thirdly, I think some critics have bullied the film on the grounds of the actors' performances; while I am no expert I will say this I think that the moments of conflict in this film (such as I mentioned above) show as much maturity and promise as any I've seen in older, more established actors.My recommendation if you're reading these comments because you're sitting on the fence, I say go ahead and watch it. But when you do, make sure to try and engage the movie on its own terms with the traditional suspension of disbelief. If you make the initial leap to try and understand all the points of view (parents, students, kids, school administrators, and scientists) and put your moral compass on reserve, you will be both scared, impressed, and maybe even a little moved.

He starts his first day of school the next day and that's when he meets a couple of misfits - the fidgety Gavin and rebel chick Rachael, where he learns that the school is made up of groups and the one called the Blue Ribbons catches his eye as they seem a little to perfect. Soon enough Gavin has become one of these Blue Ribbons. In shock of his transformation, Steve and Rachael dig dip into this mystery of these A-grade students who seem to get violent when they get urges they know that are wrong.I must've been brainwashed into watching this messy rubbish! What we've got here is a hyperactive, flashed up film that's void of imagination in its sloppy story telling and it doesn't evoke much in a way of tension. Being a fan of the X-files, I thought that it wouldn't have felt out-of-place in an episode of the series. Which, the ironic thing is that the director David Nutter has directed many of the episodes on 'The X-files'. You could say it's a movie length version without the FBI agents and his TV origins come to the party with it feeling overall like a made for TV picture. Obviously they know their target audience here, by catering for the needs of the younger generation with it focusing on its flashy details, rollicking rock soundtrack and a cast full familiar young faces like James Marsden, Katie Holmes, Nick Stahl, Katharine Isabelle and a small appearance by Ethan Embry. Other names that appeared from the older generation were Steve Railsback, Bruce Greenwood and William Sadler. Sadly they couldn't help this film from sinking fast as the performances were pitiful (headed by Holmes) and the characters themselves were your usual paper-thin stereotypes. The only redeemable performance that added anything was that of Stahl's spaced out Gavin whose paranoid reactions and quick replies make the viewing easier.The gimmicky plot which mixes everything from 'The Stepford Wives', 'Invasion of the Body Snatchers' and even to a extend 'Village of the Damned' doesn't eventuate up to much, but instead it becomes a really disjointed and clich√©-ridden paranoia thriller that ends up being incredibly stupid and unintentionally laughable. So many things are brought up that are never clearly expanded on and these aren't pointless avenues either, but they do become that when they seem to skim on building on those ideas to keep the story moving. At least the running time seems to go by quick enough even if it drags a bit during the mid-section. The choppy editing might've helped the pacing, but it didn't do the flimsy plot any favours. The useless dialog is so bluntly one-note and lethargically bland. The bloated score doesn't sway that far from the same chords with it becoming rather monotonous. Where the film really nose dives is that there isn't anything remotely creepy about it and it's trying to be so. Nothing is hip about all of this posing about with forced murky imagery (oh how spooky!) and the undemanding mystery phase isn't much of one.No matter how much I bag it, I found it hard to look away, like that of a horrible car accident. Although, what we see here is far from disturbing.

It is an older film, from 1998 for the perfectionists of the world, but I visit it because it is of a dying breed that hit its climax and slowly sunk away. This is the type of movie that doesn't have the ethics to show its face anymore after being mocked, ridiculed, and ripped apart by the Scream movies. The genre is teen suspense, more a vehicle to revolt against everything moral than one to thrill. And ironic enough it seems an unsolicited task to rebel in a world where police take no authority after one of the `good' students break into a bloody fist fight at a local convince store. Welcome to Cradle Bay, a place where strange things are going on, and director David Nutter never makes it priority to conceal this fact. I guess in his blunt approach he never realized that a lack of explanation doesn't substitute for mystery. After witnessing a fellow student shoot a police officer, Gavin (Nick Stahl), a teen outcast, appoints himself as narrator and commentates new student Steve (James Marsden) through life at Cradle Bay. Steve has recently moved there with his family to escape past demons that threaten the family dinner table. In a horribly plotted sequence, we see a diner table conversation functioning as nothing more than an excuse not to explore the films plot. At school divisions are ever so present. There are the skaters; the boys in leather who dream about their cars and the Blue Ribbons. The Blue Ribbons are part of a program to help worried parents by turning their troubled teenagers into model students. By planting computer chips in their heads, a school doctor can create an army of lobotomized overachievers who will excel in their work ethics. At least that's what I was able to gather. Nutter spends so much time finding ways to avoid his material that trying to get insight into what is going on is harder than finishing the last night's homework. After being `sold out' by his parents Gavin is forced into the Blue Ribbon program and it is up to Steve and Rachel (teen poster queen Katie Holms who, at her best is one of today's most promising teen actors and at her worse is, well, better than this), to team up and uncover the secret behind the Blue Ribbons. But they never find a secret. They never rise above or break down boundaries. Nor do they even begin to understand the logic behind what is going on here. Neither does the audience because Nutter never makes it an issue to create surprises, making plot revelations no more than a build up of what we have already learned and already come to expect. The conclusion is every bit as sadistic as it is implausible, showing none more than the lack of commitment writer Scott Rosenberg had to his story, a compilation between A Clockwork Orange and the Stepford Wives in a post grunge generation. The idea behind Disturbing Behaviour is that the educational system is so hung up on image and punctuality that teachers are doing nothing more to their students than brainwashing them (ho ho the satire is killing me). Yet irony takes its toll when we realize, after an unwarranted visit to an insane asylum that the school vision has been demised by the dynamic heroics of central character Steve. And even in a world trying to be perfect, the `ideal' students have side effects. They exhibit violent dislike to all that are not of their kind, including parents and peers alike. The scariest thing about this film is in the idea that the ones that you need worry most about sending a fellow student home in a body bag are not the ones who dress in black or listen to rock music. Rather the ones in charge of holding school sponsored bake sales. The script in question is full of plot devices so oblivious to all but their own existence that it is a more fun to pick them out than to watch the film implode under their weight. In this case we have the kid who knows to much, the bounty hunter who poses in  role, hoping that nothing will put his mission in jeopardy (although who I will not say, you'll know before they do), the scene in which the villain convinces the heroes parents that he is there to help. And, my person favourite, the loss of a loved one who serves no more than for superfluous flashback sequences. In this case it's a brother, although personal classification reflects nothing to a story that bears no need for a script implication such as this anyway. But it is this death that prompts the move to Cradle Bay with no deeper explanation than `everything will be better here.' To say that Disturbing Behaviour is a shallow film that was made without thought or insight would be missing the point. It's like telling the kid with the blue hair that he looks strange, the more you tempt the outwardly the stronger they become. So is it possible for a film like this to rebel against social status in the school system? Well, if your idea of rebellion lies in doing everything the exact opposite of what a good movie would do, consider this one a success.

They're snatched by this organization, including teachers (sounds a little 'Faculty' doesn't it) and parents, where their brains are operated on, and they return, virtual buttheads, (a little 'Society' too) where they have no time for losers. If I was the result of those jocks, I'd go hell for leather, out of this place. Marsden and his Sis notice the disturbing behavior taking place over the campus, one jock going nuts in the cafeteria.

Stahl's great monologue, involving an insight into the different types of groups of campus, in cool wording was a moment in this film.

On the surface a teen flick, it has all the standard elements cliques, peer pressure, angst, crushes, etc. Two groups vie for the attention/control of the 'new kid in school' Steve Clark (played by James Marsden). Frankly, I was thrown off by Marsden as I found him to be a bit too mature (age-wise) to be convincing as a green teen! Steve immediately is befriended by school rebellious school outcasts Gavin (the scene-stealing Nick Stahl) and Rachel (a Goth-looking Katie Holmes). Marsden is noticeably older than both Stahl and Holmes, both of whom at this time were actually teenagers, so I was a bit thrown off with him playing a teen.Stahl actually delivers the best performance in the film, and carries it for the first half, then disappears for a significant part of the second half (there is a reason!). Marsden tries and shows signs of good acting, but he wasn't given much to work with and is essentially playing the typical interchangeable hero part. Holmes fares much worse as she is rather unconvincing as a Goth chick! Her character is pretty much lifeless throughout. Other than Stahl, the most interesting characters are teen loser Andy (played gleefully by Tobias Mehler) and the weird school janitor Dorian (an over the top, enjoyable performance by William Sadler). The usually reliable Bruce Greenwood's gets stuck in the clich√© role of the town villain, replete with fake mustache to PROVE that he's evil!The first half is very disturbing and combines elements of mystery, horror, and teen drama. The mass teen weirdness is relayed very slyly and creepily to the viewer and it really looks like the film is going somewhere! But once DISTURBING BEHAVIOR strips away subtleties and reveals the plot, it gets dull very fast! It ends up being very predictable and devolves into a typical 'the whole town is evil' flick!I think that the film wanted to be a satire on societal conformity and individuality, but the final act plays like a zombie-horror flick with rather unconvincing 'action' scenes and some very cheesy moments and bad acting! The very end of the flick is exactly what I would expect in a dime-a-dozen horror flick, which this movie ends up being!

Meeting up with Gavin Strict, (Nick Stahl) U.V., (Chad Donella) and their friend Rachel Wagner, (Katie Holmes) they inform him that the local jocks in town, Andy Effkin, (Tobias Mehler) Trent Whalen, (Derek Hamilton) and Robbie Stewart, (P.J. Prinsloo) are into something weird that causes them great concern. Realizing it has something to do with the joining a sacred Blue Ribbons fraternity, which has most of the students on campus as members. Believing something else is wrong, they stumble across a secret society that is implanting students with a special device to modify their behavior, and they race to stop them before his family and others fall to the change.The Good News This here wasn't that bad but ad some good parts. The best part is the film is quite creepy at places, mainly due to the fact that it keeps the mystery rightly unknown until the end. By keeping it that way, there's a good build as it throws piece after piece towards something that is a huge unknown works wonderfully in here, making the revelation feel special with all the attention towards it. That is a fantastic advantage, as the different actions which come about, from the different methods used to show how the change has taken place to the little bits of evidence that make it clear something has happened, and it gives a certain amount of atmosphere to the proceedings. This also manages a little more excitement once the film gets to the psychiatric hospital, which is really great. It's creepy, unsettling and really just plain perfect for a horror film, and is one of the best examples around. The film is really good once it gets there, and it remains a highlight. The last plus here is the film's ending. This is a really action-packed using several big brawls, a great car chase that has the great resolution to the big mystery which here also allows for the great conclusion, the visual of the car going off the side of the cliff with the others all along the sides and back of it. It's quite fun to be able to see it played out fully, and it's the best part of the film. Altogether, these are the best parts of the film.The Bad News This here didn't have much wrong with it, but they are big flaws. The biggest one here, which is that the tactics used to indicate the behavioral change aren't that scary. The fact that it's just not in the least bit scary or creepy is a huge factor here, since it's got a lot of these scenes in the beginning which are supposed to show that something is wrong, but all it does is just showcase one lame tactic after another about how lame it is. Nothing that happens, from the bullying beat-downs to the association with different cliques and such isn't all that scary, yet that's all the attempts made to try to build up to something, which here is a deadly dull since nothing really works all that well. The worst factor of all this is that it goes on for so long, since it's pretty much all the first hour of the film that it does this, so there's a lot of time to show off some really nice ideas and scenes to really drive them home, but it's got nothing to showcase at all, and to do it for so much of the film is really bad. The other big flaw here is that there's not a whole lot of blood and gore in this, since there's hardly any deaths at all in the film except for the ending. There really needed to be a few deaths scattered throughout to help the film along, and the ones we have are really uninspiring, making for another big disappointment. These here are the film's problems.The Final Verdict This here is watchable at best, painful at worst so with all the parts available, this here is the definition of hit-or-miss.

In a movie about kid-zombies, Marsden is the biggest fake of all; with the built-in apologia that his character has gone off-course because of his brother's suicide, it is still completely unacceptable for model-perfect Marsden to be palmed off as a have-not (he'd be readily accepted at any high school, and the stoners who befriend him here wouldn't stand a chance). It's a disastrous piece of casting, not helped by the slang-heavy dialogue, sounding as if it were written by a high school drop-out armed with a thesaurus.

It's perhaps being equaled by the dreadful musical score of the movie, by Mark Snow. He has some good music in him, I mean after all he is the man behind the music and theme of The X-Files but he simply did an horrible job for this movie.Also a problem with this movie is that there basically is too little interesting or spectacular happening. For a movie that presents itself as an horror movie, it's simply lacking on all fronts.The most exciting stuff comes from Nick Stahl, who is the best acting within this movie. It makes it a real shame that half way through his character changes and he also for some reason more or less disappears out of the movie, while in the first half he still was being presented and handled as a main character. What the movie is further more lacking is a main villain. Bruce Greenwood's role is way too limited within this movie and his little mustache is way too distracting to regard him as a successful movie villain. It also makes it more or less sort of disturbing that his character- and his 'robots' are all being killed off in the end. It really didn't feel right to me that everyone of them had to die, as if they were already lost and doomed and there was no way they could had been changed back.Not the worst movie you'll ever see but it will still feel like a waste of time.5/10http//bobafett1138.blogspot.com/ "},{"Title":"A blue ribbon for boredom.","Date":"21 May 2007","Score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Horror, Mystery, Sci-Fi","Review":" A guy moves to town and almost everyone at school is in this group where they all act like they just walked out of a bad stereotype '50s movie.

While `Disturbing Behavior' is no-where near these great films, seeing director David Nutter's original intent for the movie makes one enjoy it far more. I recently got a hold of another `cut' of the film by having all the deleted scenes available on the DVD recorded (unprofessionally) back into the movie.  You see, MGM decided to cut out a lot of the film (about 20 minutes), probably for fear that too much substance to the story would bore and confuse the MTV-slugs they were planning to distribute it to. They even cut some of the best scenes out. It was never the director's intent to butcher `Disturbing Behavior' in this way and upon theatrical release it quickly flopped.

The only problem is that the process of brain-washing kids occasionally sends the `little robots' into violent rages when emotions they are not programed to deal with, like sexual urges, come up.The added scenes make the movie much better.  Characters, like Newberry, are fleshed quite a bit more and we even get a chance to see James Marsden (Steve) and Katie Holmes (Rachel) really act.  Before, these characters felt too cold and underdeveloped.  The conspiracy itself is more believable because a source of funding for it is shown.  The reason why Caldicott and his scientists came to the town of Cradle Bay is also given.  The original ending is in my own cut and it gives a far more emotional finale and a more appropriate end to Gavin (Nick Stahl). Still, I have a few complaints about `Disturbing Behavior'.  First, a few plot holes still exist, like, how did Steve and Rachel break into a mental institute so easily?  The way the `Blue Ribbons' are all killed and the way the conspiracy is crushed are still largely unbelievable.  The very talented actress Katherine Isabelle (`Ginger Snaps', `Turning Paige') is underused and that U.V. guy is annoying. Even though it is flawed, the director's cut of Disturbing Behavior is still a good movie.  Unfortunately, it has yet to be released by any studio.Movie *** out of 4  "},{"Title":"too predictable, too trashy - right from the start","Date":"24 April 2002","Score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Horror, Mystery, Sci-Fi","Review":"  The way the initial credits roll through in the film would catch anyones interest. Sitting through the movie is, however, a painful experience. Right from the first scene, situations and sub-plots are as predictable as they come, and over-cliched. Just watch the last 20 minutes, and you'll know all that has been going on, so  trashy is this movie. The plot and execution has shades of 'The Faculty' but on the whole this movie is total trash. Avoid at all costs - It might give thrills to your 9 yr old brother.

I was inclined to ask for my money back after it was over. This movie might be enjoyable for a little kid or a young teenager but anybody over 15 will be truly disappointed in it. The plot goes absolutely nowhere and the only good scenes in the movie are the ones you see in the trailer. A teenage boy moves to a city where everybody wigs out for no reason. They give you no reason or anything why the people in that town are they way they are-it just goes from one ridiculous stupid predictable scene after another. And the ending was the worst-the only good part about the ending was the fact the movie was actually over. And guys..Katie Holmes isnt all that.

Quite simply, this was a typical teen movie, a film that was frequently predictable and mediocre at best.  A somewhat clever idea was wasted here, and even with a meager running time of 84 minutes, I still found myself watching the clock early and often.  Basically, there's not really any good reason to bother watching this film, for it is yet another thriller that isn't thrilling.

Cheap films following the success of similar better movies are common, sometimes very common. At times C grade films can be wonderful, Casablanca is the prize example, but Disturbing Behaviour is no Casablanca!A troubled teen, played by Jimmy Marsden, who looks far too old for the part, moves to a new school. But there's something wrong. The local dope head malcontent Gavin (Nick Stahl) has seen a murder and for some reason decides to adopt the new boy.And so do The Blue Ribbons - apparently there's a similar grouping in the States of course. They're a bit weird according to Gavin and there's an opportunity for sometimes X files director David Nutter (Great Name!) But he backs off here, and just about everywhere else in Disturbing Behaviour it seems.The ending is abrupt and the film is short at less than 90 minutes. There's hardly a heart flutter for an audience or a head starter for a critic. As for The X Files, well they're also, often enough, pretty confusing aren't they.Katie Holmes (Dawson's Creek) plays Rachael and she's about the only reason I can think of to recommend this film, but that's a sex thing, and that's not enough.Get out a Scream video instead.

Absolutely no horror involved with this picture.  The film would  have been greatly improved if it had expanded on its plot.  It introduces us to it and then abandons it in place of lame action with dull characters.  There were way too many good/evil kids in here that we couldn't hate them enough because we didn't know all of them.  There's hardly any conflict at the end like Scream and others and therefore not worth watching at all.  I left the film with a sour taste in my mouth.  I overheard some teens who also saw the film also say that the film was great and that they should make a sequel.  Why?  this film goes for the predictable ending where one of the evil brainwashed kids escapes and is now substituting for a class elsewhere. Is that supposed to scare us.  He doesn't have the technology to  do to them what they did to him.  And what about the hero and heroine's parents. They left them in town while escaping on the ferry.  This  movie had so many plot-holes and loose-ends that it wasn't funny.

Not much of  the movie is Scary, but there are a few good parts in the movie that really  get you going.

Hamhanded satire belabors all the obvious points (the bad repressed guys go psycho when they're sexually aroused for instance), has no connection with reality (in real life the stoners and the like are more likely to be the tormentors, not the tormented) and is full of plot holes. (Movie was admittedly cut to pieces.) Blandly acted from all concerned. Rips off a lot of iconography from better movies, most especially A CLOCKWORK ORANGE. Generally just a waste of time for all concerned; avoid.

The youthful cast was more than competent though the material didn't really require them to expand their horizons too much. James Marsden (X-Men) makes a decent protagonist, Katie Holmes reinvents her image as a tough gothic looking chick and Nick Stahl (Terminator 3) actually gives a very memorable multi-layered performance.
