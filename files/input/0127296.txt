[{"Title":"What's that you say Ms. Robertson","Date":"17 January 2005","Score":"10 out of 10 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy","Review":" I was not conscious of Splendor being a Gregg Araki film when I started watching it but after the first two sequences I was thinking this is great directing-who did this? While the technique screams Araki, as does the casting of Kathleen Robertson, the narrative is so conventional that you find the combination hard to reconcile. I loved an earlier comment that Splendor is like a John Hughes remake of The Doom Generation; i.e. very conventional and without the sex and violence, with a three-way relationship (two males-one female), Johnathon Schaech, and Director Araki's absolutely amazing production and post-production skills-along with his less than dazzling scripting.Although Araki is paying homage to the great screwball comedies of the 1930's Topper, It Happened One Night, The Awful Truth, and Bringing Up Baby; the style and substance of Splendor is closer to Mike Nichols' The Graduate (not to mention an amusing parody of the Graduate's climatic wedding scene).Kathleen Robertson has the Rose McGowen part in this version of The Doom Generation and is generally well suited to the role. I have not decided yet if Robertson is in McGowen's class as an actress, or in the class of her fellow Canadians Mia Kirshner and Sarah Polley. Robertson was excellent in Maniac Mansion and Beverly Hills 90210, but these were similar roles that appear to mirror her own cool and detached personality. One thing that is clear is that she was a great choice for Ariki's trademark close-ups. Anyone perceptive enough to close the camera to face distance when shooting McGowen, Robertson, and most recently Michelle Trachtenberg has a eye for breathtakingly beautiful visuals.The premise does not really have enough substance to sustain a feature although it might work as a half-hour television sit-com (see Three's Company). When the premise becomes tired the story brings in a new character, Eric Mabious; and the film self-destructs, killing time until a decent ending sequence. A tip-off that a screen writer has limited life experience to draw from is having cast and crew occupations for the characters. Robertson's character is an aspiring actress and Mabious is directing her in a made-for-television drama. His character is so hopelessly one-dimensional and painfully pathetic that I was convinced that he had a sinister side (what was with those blue contact lenses) that would eventually manifest itself. But this does not happen, maybe Araki had something interesting in mind and abandoned it in re-write. Mabious becomes a non-factor (see totally irrelevancy) and his scenes were simply inserted as padding to get this thing up to feature length.The bottom line is that Araki fans will be a little disappointed with Splendor. It is very conventional, it isn't much of a story, and the good banter is limited (although Kelly MacDonald has fantastic dialogue in all her scenes) . But if your Araki appreciation is more for his directorial talents (casting, mise en scene details, camera movement and placement) and his post-production originality, you will find Splendor measures up very well to his prior work. The morning after scene early in the film simply blows away anything similar from any director.

This goofy, lovable little comedy is highly enjoyable and clever and is full of unusual twists. The two guys Veronica (Kathleen Robinson) falls in love with(Matt Keeslar and Johnathon Schaech)are both gorgeous, but totally inept, ineffectual and co-dependent. Rather than vying for being the macho guy who becomes her one and only, they revert to being taken care of by their Veronica and in this way, reveal that their attraction to her is more motherly than wifely (is that a word?). When she does meet a stable, caring man who is willing to marry her and give her and her little stranger a secure future, she is torn between love and security.Robertson, who resembled Nicole Kidman more than just a little, gives a tongue in cheek but emotionally true performance. Schaech (God, I wish he'd change his name to something more spell-able) plays Abel as a goofy, but totally lovable nerd, and Keeslar plays his Zed as a man who thinks with his crotch, but is in his own nerdy way, totally lovable as well.The drunken scene where Veronica dares Abel to kiss Zed is met with disgust, but when she asks Zed to kiss Abel, Zed explains It's not going to kill you, believe me! Zed's been around the block more than once and the kiss, which is all Keeslar, is beautiful.Eric Mabius' Eric- the stable one - is equally attractive in his own way. None of the men here are perfect and as in real life, Veronica must choose the lesser of two imperfections to invest her future in.Abel and Zed (yes, the alphabet from A-Z) are two sexy losers. Eric is a non-sexy winner. Veronica is just confused, but underneath it all, she is one smart lady cookie.Schaech's CinemaScope smile is a killer and Keeslar's abs are as lethal. What would you have done?See it- Araki's writing and direction are a delight.

The three leads are all cute as hell, and do a wonderful job with the quirky script.

It would be hard for them to be more different Abel, who she meets on the crowded dance floor, is dark, sensitive, and a bit shy; Zed, the drummer of the band, is bleached blond and very outspoken. She is torn, and can't make up her mind which of them to see. So she goes out with both of them.The rest of the film follows her life for the next year, and how she handles her complex situation - which becomes even more complicated when another man, Ernest, comes into the picture. Unusually for a film (especially one made in the US), it resists the temptation of taking an easy path out of her situation.It's not perfect. It looks at some of the problems that can arise from multiple relationships, but she has too easy a time resolving them; it takes a lot longer in real life. But at least it acknowledges that the problems exist, and that it is possible to find answers.

Like Sirk's super-excessive 50's melodramas, the film attempts to turn basically banal, formulaic material into a swooning, sensual spectacle, and some scenes do have a striking design muscularity (the bar where a video triptych forms the backdrop to their conversation; Robertson's apartment, with the huge clock sometimes seeming suspended Dali-like). More often though, the enterprise seems merely shallow, with the movie flashing up blocks of color as if hoping that the mere evocation of a rainbow might somehow spawn a pot of gold. Araki pushes his actors into a banality that sometimes verges on sheer babyishness (Keeslar is particularly badly handled), and the movie - given its somewhat raunchy theme - displays an odd decorousness and modesty, being weirdly coy for example about the gay implications of the arrangement. The Toronto Film Festival guide cites Truffaut and Sturges as influences rather than Sirk - either way, Araki doesn't seem to be himself here.

In fact in many ways Splendour is like a John Hughes remake of The Doom Generations but  without the explicit sex and violence, severed heads, castrations and Parker Posey in a bizarre wig - Araki has tossed his nihilism out the window, and come up with a frustratingly conventional romcom. It continues his repeated fascination with the three-way relationship, perhaps for obvious reasons he can only portray a heterosexual relationship with two males present, and his unique visual and editing style is still apparent though toned down. Not a bad film by any means as it is enjoyable and the performances are good, but one can't help but feel underwhelmed following the daft Graduate-style ending. Let's hope this is a one-off for Araki.

But unfortunately it both is and isn't very well done.Visually, it's very well done.  Kathleen Robertson, as the Victoria who can attract two hunky guys so much that they put up with living all together, is absolutely stunning.  She's a blonde beauty to begin with, but as well her face positively radiates light in this film.  She's got the glowing look of a woman first falling head over hells in love, and then pregnant at the same time.  I'm not sure how they / she did it, but it's pretty compelling.  As well the reckless young 20 something LA party scene atmosphere, which Araki used with even more (and darker) abandon in Doom and Nowhere (and I understand as well in the all gay Totally F**ked Up which I haven't seen), is colorful here as well.  Veronica's jumping Matt at second sight, in the bathroom, is a memorably abandoned casual sex scene.  Hot.   Most of the movie is in high contrast, diffuse back lighted  candy colors.  The atmosphere is fun, fun, fun.   All of which makes a good date movie.Emotionally it only goes just below skin deep.  Yeah, OK, the two guys have different personalities, sort of.  One is the carefree musician / jock physical type.  None too bright.  But sweet.  The other is the emotionally soulful writer type.  But both soon seem to merge into hunky male dependency on her, financially and emotionally.  Ah yes. The theme song of the feminist 90's.  Actually, she digs it.There are some interesting sex relations insights (gay world derrived -- natch for the 90's), such as that for a two hunky guys and one gorgeous girl threesome in the same bed to work, the two guys are gonna have to get off on each other physically as well as emotionally, at least to some degree. (Just kissing, the film pretends -- maybe.)  But supposedly all are overwhelming hetero, if not entirely exclusively so.  The relationship conflicts which would be sure to be there, to be dealt with successfully perhaps, are hardly seen at all in this film.  In fact the guys look increasingly gay to me, but that is little explored.Instead, the plot moves forward through a different conflict -- her perceived need for ANOTHER sort of man.  A career and financially successful one, who can help her in the traditional ways -- once she learns she's pregnant from one of her happy go lucky, but femme submissive, hunks.   The trouble of course is that she doesn't LOVE the successful guy.  He too is a male submissive, but of the casper milktoast variety.  I mean this guy convinces her to go with him on a weekend getaway to his condo in Maui with the promise of only talking, and then when she's receptive to him after being blow away by the luxe, he remains true to his word, the idiot, and doesn't do diddly.  She was begging for it Earnest.  Talk about a testosterone deficit!!!Nonetheless, our heroine gets engaged to Earnest.  He's so nice, and life with him would be so secure.  This is getting pedestrian.  As well, at this point the film loses any semblance of honesty.  Earnest is the kind of guy who would stick around, whether it was fun or not, she explains to her girlfriend.  Of course the film never asks the obvious reverse question. Is she?  Probably because you'd get the wrong answer.  Next her lesbo girlfriend warns her against marrying someone she doesn't really and truly love.  I'm doing the responsible thing she says.  Her girlfriend counters 'Even if it means ball and chaining yourself to him for the rest of your life?As if!!!  Under today's feminist reformed divorce laws?  What total dishonesty!  Just what would be the downside to Victoria marrying Earnest? How long does she have to stay with him?  What does she get if she splits after a couple of years?  For that matter, what would keep this thinking-outside-the-traditional-box femme from shacking up with her two hunks three or four nights a week while she's married to her well off milktoast?  And what would be the consequences for her if she did? Horrible, for such duplicity, right?  Hardly.  If Earnest decided not to put up with it after a while, guess who'd have to pay for the mistake, and the transgressions?  Why Earnest of course!!! Welcome to marriage law in feminist America.  Whatever emotional significance most people still attach to marriage commitments at least before the fact, legally marriage is now almost entirely a one way contract which obligates only men, and not women.Was the possibility that Earnest could be viewed by Victoria not as an alternative to her dual action thing, but really as a supplement to it, touched on by this flick?  Why not?  After all, isn't it a natural line to explore, since she's trying to combine an edgy sexual relationship with multiple submissive men, with financial security for her child?  Isn't it begging to be explored, after a line like 'Even if it means ball and chaining yourself to him for the rest of your life?Maybe it's not because then the incredible bias in feminist reformed American marriage (divorce) law today would come into focus.  We can't have that, now can we?Oh, and another thing.  When are we going to see a flick which flips this script?  Two (or more) predominantly hetero women living happily with one guy?  Where that is celebrated, I mean, rather than vilified.  When in the last 1 1/2 decades has that been done?  Anyone care to name the American film?  It can't be done.

Though this may not be one of his most successful films, it certainly has enough going for it to give it a look.Narrated by flippant, kooky, slightly irritatingly shallow Veronica (Kathleen Robertson) who also is the main character of the story, we find that Veronica (aka V aka Ron) has been on a dry run for a love life for a long time, and just when she thinks she'll never find her man, up pops Halloween, and with her best friend Mike (Kelly MacDonald) she ventures into a party where she meets not one but two candidates for relationship - Abel (hunky Jonathan Schaech) who is a would be writer and is inept at about everything social and Zed (also hunky Matt Keeslar) who is a drummer whose intellect and socialization skills don't go far beyond his drumsticks. Veronica beds them both, finds them equally attractive and eventually the three become a ménage à trois in the same apartment. The two men, while transiently jealous of each other, ultimately find happiness in Veronica's breadwinning capabilities and both truly love her and each other. Things become strained when Veronica learns she is pregnant! Meanwhile, Veronica is offered upward mobility by yet another hunk Ernest (Eric Mabius) who represents stability and money whereas Abel and Zed represent only passion. Considering her pregnant life choices she agrees to marry Ernest despite her lack of loving him and all proceeds towards the wedding day when Abel and Zed decide to make changes in the plans.Schaech, Mabius and Keeslar provide sufficient eye candy to overcome a strained script. Had Veronica been cast differently the story may have had a better impact, but as it is this remains a fun, spunky movie that for Araki fans is a good diversion.

It stays away from the stylistic and linguistic tendencies that plagued both The Doom Generation and Nowhere. Visually, the film is also much more conventional, adding to a slightly strange, but by no means bizarre plot line.  It's the story of Veronica, featuring a fine performance by Kathleen Robertson, who has fallen in love with two different men.  She somehow manages to keep them apart, and then eventually, to get them to like each other.  Together they form a triple, as opposed to a couple.  It seems a bit of a stretch to assume that this complex relationship would work, that the two would be willing to share her as a girlfriend, and that they would all be able to live together in seeming harmony.  The problem, is that the two different men soon become crude characterizations, rather than flesh and blood people that we could care about.  They seem rather pathetic at times, and things get complicated when yet another man enters Veronica's life, offering stability and desiring a relationship with her.  Despite the obvious nods to Three's Company, and the sometimes funny scenes that Arakki conjures up, the film is simply not exciting enough to hold our interest in these characters, the writing is not bold enough to grab out attention, and the film isn't nearly as erotic as its set up would suggest.  All in all, it's an okay film from a director I usually don't like all that much, but it's definitely not what you're expecting from an Arakki film (which doesn't necessarily mean that it's any better for its difference) "}{"Title":"Paging Miss Hopkins","Date":"20 August 2008","Score":"","Genre":"Comedy","Review":" Surfing the cable channels one night, I stumbled on this little movie and was struck first by the gorgeous cinematography the close-ups of Kathleen Robertson were almost hallucinatory. Despite her choppy bleached hair, ordinary looks, and snippy acting style, she looked so radiantly attractive that it was immediately clear the director was madly in love with her. The director being Gregg Araki, his taste in men was actually better he clearly enjoyed putting Matt Keeslar and Jonathan Schaech together on a couch, in bed, and in the shower. The movie is Araki's modern version of Design for Living, the old Noel Coward warhorse (note the third-act appearance of a character named Ernest, the bourgeois dullard the heroine almost marries). Too bad Araki didn't have Miriam Hopkins to work with instead of Robertson. Visually, the movie is amazing, but where it falls seriously short is in the writing... to say that Araki is no Noel Coward is like saying that Pauly Shore is no Charlie Chaplin. Like, duh. Somehow, though, this wafer-thin comedy seemed to liberate him from the cynical dead end he'd fallen into in the 90s -- his next movie (with a solid story by Scott Heim) was Mysterious Skin, a riveting, fearless masterpiece that was unquestionably the best American movie of 2004.

Summer Lovers, Threesome, Three to Tango are a few examples. By this time, there isn't a whole lot new that can be added to the mix, though this film tries hard to be lively, edgy, funny and compelling. Robertson plays a young, struggling actress in L.A. who's in the midst of a sexual dry spell. Amazingly, in one night, she falls for two guys. One, Schaech, is a bookish, sensitive type while the other, Keeslar, is a wild, tattooed drummer in a band. She attempts to juggle the men and decide which one she truly wants to pursue, but eventually decides that she can't decide. Tentatively, she explains to each one of them that she has feelings for both of them. One night, with the help of several bottles of booze, they discover that they can actually function as a threesome, eventually living together. Unfortunately, things eventually get out of hand as Robertson begins to doubt the practicality of the situation and wonders if she can really have a life with these men. In walks film director Mabius who seems to fulfill every need she's ever had, except she doesn't feel for him the spark that she did with the other guys. Meanwhile, her funky artist friend MacDonald supplies commentary and support from the sidelines. Robertson, looking very lovely here, gives as good a performance as anyone could of such a self-indulgent, rather reckless person. She narrates the film in flashback with several in-your-face close-ups, speaking in that Gen-X way that can annoy some older viewers. Still, she's good in the film and manages, most of the time, to retain the audience's sympathy. Schaech, who smokes incessantly throughout, is attractive (despite some pronounced dark circles under his eyes) and reasonably appealing. Keeslar is, at first glance, a dumb lug, but his appeal grows throughout the film and he winds up as one of the most lovable characters. He's handsome and sexy. MacDonald enjoys her sassy role and has quite a few sarcastic and funny lines. Mabius is very likable, perhaps too likable to make this story really work since it's hard to see why he isn't good enough for Robertson. He gives an amiable, gentle, memorable performance which goes fairly unrewarded in the film. This is a revved up, colorful, splashy rendition of the old threesome genre that is often sexy and rarely boring. It looks great and has some nice acting in it. Unfortunately, it never seems particularly real and the ending is less satisfying than it would like to be (not to mention clichéd.) Additionally, two characters who claim to have gone through great change actually haven't changed at all since they barely could pull it together to even present themselves at the climax. The story is pretty much paint by numbers and it's up to the actors to fill it in and try to make it all work. It only does so marginally. Still, it's an arresting and intriguing movie with more than a few memorable sequences.

"},{"Title":"The Screwball Comedy that wasn't...","Date":"23 September 1999","Score":"","Genre":"Comedy","Review":"  Director Gregg Araki introduced his new film recently at the 24th Toronto Internation Film Fest to a packed house and wetted our appetites with promises of a clever, modern homage to the great screwball comedies of the 1930's & 1940's.  Films like  It Happened One Night, The Awful Truth, The Lady Eve and Brining Up Baby.The film is a departure from the man who brought us such films as  Doom Generation and Totally F***ed Up.  A kinder, gentler Araki was being shown.The film follows the adventures of Veronica (Kathleen Robertson).  A young woman who has had the misfortune to fall for two very different guys  the kind, intellectual Abel (Jonathan Schaech) and the rocker on eleven, Zed (Matt Keeslar).  Instead of making her mind up about which one to date, she decides to try to convince them both to allow her to date them both. Things only get more complicated when both guys decide to move in with her.The film does follow the basic outline of a screwball, but it lacks the heart of one.  The actors all bring in admirable, yet unremarkable performances.  However, this is not entirely their fault.  Araki fails to deliver on the most basic element of the classic romantic comedy, the banter.  The old films thrived on the perpetual motion of the dialogue to continuously engage the audience, with Splendor we just get a round of kinky Truth or Dare.  Of course that brings up another subject, sex.  This is 1999, and people have sex.  They did in the 30's too.  They just weren't allowed to show it or talk about it in the movies.  The writers had to be resourseful, knowing just how far they could skate.  I don't think it's prudish to expect the same for a modern incarnation.  Again, this gets back to the dialogue.  They had to skirt around the issue, but those writers always knew how to let the audience know without coming out and saying it or doing it.Perhaps, I'm stuck in the past.  But I think that if you set your sights and the audience's up that high, you had better be able to deliver the goods. Maybe if Araki had watched The Awful Truth (a film that he did an introduction to at the same festival the day after his film screened) before he made Splendor, he and the audience would have been better off.  He's still rather new at the game, and maybe his next film will be a little more like Sturges and a little less like a TV Sitcom.

Many will rent this hard to find video to see if the lovely Miss Robertson will disrobe. Although she does a number of times in the movie, the audience only gets to see very little of the action. Overall, a nice little film about a 90's LA relationship ( more like a threesome) between 3 characters who slowly learn to become friends and then a family. A good independent film, but far from anything great for a teen comedy or a romantic comedy with sexual overtones. Robertson shows her acting talents throughout the film but overall teases the audience to believe that Splendor is one of those straight to video / cable movies where you get to see a certain actress naked for the same price that you would pay to rent a copy of Body of Evidence or Poison Ivy.

He's a dark, handsome stranger. She falls for him instantly. Then, as the music act gets underway, she sees Zed (the band drummer). Again, she falls head over heels for this guy too. But she keeps her cool as she dances with Abe. She leaves the club with Mike, gives her phone number to Abe, and spends the night with Zed. The next day, she sets up her date with Abe and is equally charmed. She can't let either one go. So, she tells them both about each other. They agree to let her see them both. After they meet, they all move in together. Veronica then meets a third man and discovers she's pregnant. Spell-binding. Actually evolves from a mysterious story about the incredible life events of a twenty-something having a lot of fun she missed in her late teens, to a heartfelt story of love and responsibility for a revolving relationship a girl has with three men (two of which end up in bed with her at the same time) and a set of twin babies inside her.A perfect movie. Rings every safe bell in the house marvelously. Fills the viewer with feeling and an afterglow of intelligence. A film-making risk worth taking. **** out of ****.

She is down-right annoying as Mike, Veronica's British best friend. If MacDonald had not been cast, this would of got a better score. 69%The Screenplay/Directing Splendor starts out with a really awesome idea and a great script, but half way through, it loses its witty charm and cleverness. But, Greg Arakki writes and directs, this is his first feature film. I give him credit for the un-rushed effort. 69%Other Splendor has no special effects or great editing, but it has some really awesome set-decorations at the start. 59%Overall Splendor is a fun, average flick that could have been a lot better if the script had been improved.

She's not the brightest light on the dashboard, but to show you her brain pan is still active, she'll occasionally let out a ripsnorting burp, or make a raspberry farting noise, just to make you pay attention. Cuteness is her alpha and omega--both as in, Oh my God, he is so cute I could just die! and Oh, you shouldn't have, that is SO CUTE! If you follow the independent scene, you may have heard of her--her name is Gregg Araki. And where Araki once feebly aped the devices of one Jean-Luc Godard, we must resign ourselves to the fact that he has embraced the auteur he truly loves Aaron Spelling.If you ever wondered what happens to vapid, rave-esque posers when they get a few crow's feet, SPLENDOR gives you the answer they're as cutesy and complacent as the next old geezer. Here, Araki tries for DESIGN FOR LIVING-style screwball comedy, which, in his lexicon, translates to An appearance by Mr. Roper is imminent. As the multiple-partnered heroine, Kathleen Robertson has a very tiny, upturned, Waspy nose. As the dumb bohunk boy toy of the triangle, Matthew Keezlar has biceps the size of canned hams. And as the third leg of the menage, Jonathan Schaech has a resemblance to a Lebanese Peter Gallagher. If one of the characters from a Bret Easton Ellis novel took Prozac and got some foreign-market funding, this is the movie he would make. Araki's worship of pretty, baby-talky people and things can leave you feeling like a Moonie at the end of a long day of flower-selling.

It started out mediocre, before dropping into bad pretty quick.  I think Kathleen Robertson was beautiful and played the role right.  She was the highlight.  She could've easily been over-dramatic and cheesy, but she wasn't.  Kudos.  She must've learned something from 90210.  The story should've been more about the relationship and the struggle to make it work and more sociology, but throwing the pregnancy and that movie director guy into it were just huge, uncreative cop-outs in telling the story.  The writer should be ashamed.

Amusing, indeed. Plotwise, it's - to a certain, unpredictable and even unthought of point - interesting, if we were to learn a lot about modern day mentalities and social patterns. Which we don't, not even in an evasive manner. So we have this young lady, Veronica, who, one night, meets two prince charming. Of course it's quite overwhelming, and our young damsel in distress, having been placed in a most ungrateful situation, is faced with a decision-making task. So many choices, so many options, what to do - one would wonder. Of course, it'd be great to have a taste of both (as Marque humourfully sings about, in one of his songs). Initially, Veronica dates the guys separately but later, after everyone involved meets everyone involved, the three become...well, two he's and a she. Rise and shine before thy sinks, as the motto goes (or doesn't).Veronica has a very clear character. She is a confused young girl, who acts on her instincts and sees later that the future isn't as easy as she initially thought. So then appears another guy, who can offer her all she wants...just that - darn! - she doesn't love him and so the ride goes on and on.It's too bad thoughts tend to go astray at certain moments. I mean, I've seen much better love movies with twisted plots! And, probably, so have you.

The film's opening shot sets the tone for the entire film; a beautiful girl lies between two handsome men, a look of pure bliss on her face, and sleepy satisfaction on theirs! Unusual for a mainstream American film, but this is NOT your usual 'Boy Meets Girl' movie!Young Veronica, portrayed by the astonishingly lovely Kathleen Robertson, comes to Hollywood to pursue an acting career; one evening, attending a crowded costume party with lesbian friend, Mike (British actress Kelly McDonald), she sees hunky drummer Zed (played with goofy charm by Matt Keeslar), and immediately is aroused, much to Mike's chagrin! As she is pulled away, she literally runs into handsome, sensitive writer Abel (the always watchable Johnathon Schaech) and sparks fly again, despite Mike's funny insults! After passing him her phone number, she retreats to the bathroom...and runs into Zed! Passions explode immediately, and a tryst begins that ends in her apartment, the next day...when Abel phones her!Veronica bemoans the fact that it's always 'feast or famine', but likes both guys too much to date either of them, exclusively! Of course the two suitors eventually meet, and Veronica is so sweet and desirable that she manages to convince both of them that a loving relationship between the three is not only possible, but desirable!This would be the 'end' of many films, but director Araki uses the threesome as the framework for an entire movie, covering a wide assortment of funny situations! As the 'glue' that holds this unusual relationship together, Robertson's portrayal of Veronica is a marvel, funny and sexy, yet vulnerable!Can this trio of young lovers survive, especially with a young, wealthy TV producer (Eric Mabius) waiting in the wings, to take Veronica away from all this? Watch 'Splendor', and find out! You WON'T be disappointed!
