The first movie, when compared to this sequel, feels like the main characters had something to prove to one another and not just to themselves where this chapter feels more self-motivated and real, primarily to the addition of Jon LovitzOne thing is for sure, without the City Slickers' version of the Criterion Brothers as ranch hands, it was definitely more enjoyable for me. The danger sequences were slim and short while maintaining a tall adventure.Instead of using the first third of the movie to develop all the characters, they catch you up on Phil and Mitch and then lovingly introduce you to Glen. It left more time for the actual movie and less time for the you must grow up to be a warrior speeches and diatribes. I loved it! Jon Lovitz is awesome!It rates an 8.7/10 from...the Fiend .

That's the selling point of the movie it's entertaining. Not only do you get a comedy with a lot of laughs, you get brilliant Western scenery enhanced by the widescreen DVD.The negatives, at least for me, was the all-too-secular outlook on life and an obsession with sex espoused by lead actor Billy Crystal and his clueless buddies Daniel Stern and Jon Lovitz and the unnecessary profanity by Jack Palance.All the characters, however, are definitely fun to watch and there is a good message in the end about sacrificing for friends and relatives. The story also features a very neat twist at the end. This is a film you can laugh at with multiple viewings.

It has been so long since I saw the original that I can't make a comparison.  But Billy Crystal gave as good a performance as usual, and Jon Lovitz was a worthwhile addition as Crystal's idiotic brother.  Jack Palance gave another Oscar-winning performance as the sailor-turned-restaurant-pirate who hoped his late brother knew a big secret (too bad those who decide Academy Award nominations didn't agree).It took a while to get to the quest for Curly's Gold, but even the early parts of the movie were entertaining.  The search for gold was the best part, with these bumbling idiots, and Duke, getting into all kinds of trouble.  Plenty of action, and beautiful scenery, and lots of physical comedy.  I wasn't all that happy with the ending, but the reality is, can a group of ordinary guys really be happy if they find millions of dollars in gold? I won't say what went wrong in their quest, but they did get to be really, really happy at one point, and that was satisfying.The real gold here was Duke's telling of his life story, and the guys working together despite incredible odds.  This was probably as good as the first movie for those reasons.

Okay, so Slickers II isn't as funny as the first. I agree. However, I think it does have some laughs, and generates enough to recommend, especially if you are a fan of the original. The basic plot of this film is that Crystal and pals find Duke (Jack Palance. Yes, I wrote Jack Palance. Read on for explanations) -- Curly's twin brother (See? Now it makes sense, right?) -- or rather, he finds them. After letting them in on a secret that there's buried treasure in a cave somewhere out in the yonder, and that Duke wants Crystal to help him find it, we're all geared up and ready for more City Slickers. Really, the plot is just a worthless excuse to see familiar faces in a big Arizona desert. But, a lot of sequels have throwaway plots, and I think there's a bit of magic to this one. Of course it's contrived and silly, but it's like a bunch of little kids following a sketched treasure map. It's fun to watch, and brings back fond memories. I recommend City Slickers II The Legend of Curly's Gold. It's not great, but it's fun, and worth a few bucks on a Friday night.3/5 stars-John Ulmer "},{"Title":"Amusing &#150; but really just a retread of the original's jokes with less conviction and energy","Date":"12 November 2002","Score":"4 out of 5 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Western","Review":"  Now turning 40, Mitch Roberts is at ease with himself and full of confidence.  He is doing well at work his marriage is good and he is happy.  His friend Phil is causing him some trouble as he has Mitch's old job but isn't working well and further stress arrives for Mitch in the shape of his deadbeat brother Glen.  However the trio get excited when Mitch discovers a map to hidden gold in the lining of Curly's hat.  But can the group recover the gold successfully?  Is it even real? And is Mitch just imagining that Curly has come back from the grave to haunt him?I saw this years ago in the cinema and had vague memories of it as being pretty good.  I saw it a few nights ago on TV and have to say that my memory has not served me well.  The plot here is silly &#150; any excuse to get three wise-crackers out on horses again in the wild west.  The way they manage to rope Jack Palance back in doesn't really work and hurts the feel of the film.  In the original Palance worked but here it feels like he's been shoehorned into it and that he's forced to over egg the cake.The film has a few good lines and laughs but too often it just repeats jokes from the first film to lesser effect.  It's a shame because the film is freed from the sentimental soul searching that bogged down the latter stages of the original.  However it does nothing with this freedom.  I'm sure I remembered this as a comic adventure yarn, again I was mistaken.  The same old jokes but it lacks a soul or a centre.  The original may have been a little sentimental but it complimented the comedy for the most part &#150; here that is missing, and it hurts.Crystal delivers his lines with vigour and is funny &#150; I always find him funny!  But at times he does look like he's on autopilot.  Stern is also just treading the same old material over and is only so-so.  Kirby decides not to return so Lovitz replaces him and actually does alright.  However his brand of humour isn't as good as Crystal and the two don't gel &#150; although he does get some good laughs.  Palance tries again but the Oscar magic isn't there and I couldn't help feel he took away from his original role somewhat.Overall this is amusing at best but really pales against the original (which wasn't a classic itself).  The action isn't up to much and the comedy only delivers a few laughs, preferring instead to retread as many of the original's jokes as possible.

All that notwithstanding, this sad sequel forgets the honest and genuine drama that was at the heart of the original film and replaces it with dopey, juvenile humor and an egregious attempt at sentimentality. We get to hear the same boring, recycled jokes from the first movie beginning with the birthday morning phone call, to the dialogue about setting VCRs, to the same dumb joke, He's behind me isn't he? I know Crystal's irritating screaming is always good for a chuckle, isn't it? It just goes to show if a joke doesn't work the first time, use it again, only louder. If you're a Jon Lovitz fan and want to see him do a halfway decent attempt at drama rather than his schmaltzy performance in this movie, I recommend Mr. Destiny. If you want to see Billy Crystal do drama, don't. I'll admit that I did like this movie when it first came out, but I've since graduated from Junior High.

It's sort of fun, and there are some genuinely funny lines scattered about (the whole 'Pass the Phil' scene) but the first film was one of the finest comedies ever made, and this isn't. Signs of desperation trickle through the movie like a cinematic flop sweat. As the plot mechanics groan in order to get Billy Crystal and Daniel Stern back in the saddle, we're first introduced to Curly's identical twin brother - a contrived way to get Jack Palance back - and then Crystal's brother (Jon Lovitz) fills the gap left by Bruno Kirby, a character you would think might have come up in all those conversations about family in the original movie. The happy ending for Stern's character is unfortunately reversed, which just seems a bit mean-spirited.While it's likable, this has nothing like the depth or poignancy or sheer avalanche of hilarious, character-based dialogue that the first movie had. This is far more of a bland and straightforward adventure with a few funny bits, and there's no getting past the fact that 'City Slickers' didn't need a sequel and the one we have really isn't good enough.

Rarely as good as the first, they can even sometimes cause detrimental effects to the predecessor. In 1994 then so many must have questioned the logic in creating a sequel to the hit film City Slickers from three years before. As far as sequels go though, City Slickers II The Legend of Curly's Gold isn't that bad. Yes it's not as good as the first film and there are times you groan with disapproval, but for the most part it is an entertaining follow on to the previous film.Mitch Robbins (Billy Crystal) has turned 40. Preparing for a celebratory night of passion with his wife (Patricia Wettig), Mitch accidentally stumbles across a map in an old friends hat. Believing it to lead to gold, Mitch, best friend Phil (Daniel Stern) and Godfather quoting brother Glen (Jon Lovitz) head once more back into the desert.Clearly believing it's viewers have seen the original, this story, written by the same pairing of Lowell Ganz and Babaloo Mandel, is not afraid to put in constant references to the earlier work. Copying events which happened a year previously, lines are tributes of City Slickers and jokes are even part reconstructions. In effect, part II is almost exactly more of the same.If you decide to repeat the original, then that isn't necessarily a problem. Bringing back Crystal, Stern, one or two other cameos and even Jack Palance (Oscar nominated for the first film), the matrix is the same and the jokes do flow. Taking ideas like the Shalowitz brothers ice-cream knowledge and changing it into Glen's letter counting skills, the film picks up old notions and jumbles them around to come up with something new.The unfortunate truth of the matter though is that if you DO decide to just rehash a lot of the jokes and use the same cast and layout, then your going to loose something of the original. Amazingly, even though it was released only three years after the first film, this new part does feel a considerably more modern equivalent. With harsher colours and a more exaggerated opening animation, it feels almost like a remake. It also lacks the unique feel that the first film possessed. Introducing the characters for the first time, playing that music for the first time, stuff like that. It's like an old reunion where you meet up with the people you used to be friends with and go through the motions as if your young again. You can have a lot of fun, but you can never go back.City Slickers II is fun. It's unashamed lighthearted fun which feels like more of a remake and tribute than a sequel to it's predecessor. Bringing back most of the old cast, it feels just like the continuation of the story. For the most part this is a good thing. Once more you watch Mitch and Phil as they roam the desert. You laugh with them, you reminisce with them, you bond with them. Ultimately though, something is missing. The originality of the first film isn't there and whilst the film is still great to watch, it's not as good as it's predecessor. Fun though.

I haven't even bothered seeing the original yet (the more highly-regarded work that surprisingly won a Best Supporting Actor Oscar for Palance).I cared not a single whit about the plot--it was just fun watching the stars interact and riff off of each other. I did feel that the direction lagged in places, and perhaps a more objective editor could have sliced 10-15 minutes off and no one would have been the wiser.

First as a young actor in Soap, then as an impressionist, later in several entertaining films, and his hosting of the Oscars. Crystal had a very nice touch to things -- funny, yet also sentimental, and it shows through in this film.His sidekicks here are Daniel Stern, not my idea of a memorable actor...but his performance worked very well here.

The three men go to Vegas and set off for a few days on their treasure hunt. Mitch has been haunted by Curly's presence which turns out to be Curly's twin Duke Washburn (Jack Palance).This is so desperate to repeat the original that Palance returns as his own twin. I don't blame the movie for Bruno Kirby going missing. Who knows what the dispute was. Replacing him with Jon Lovitz feels forced which only adds to the manufactured nature of the story. I don't know if there was a time constraint but it seems to be a great opportunity for Mitch to take his wife on the journey together. If City Slicker is about a mid-life crisis, City Slicker 2 could be about some sort of family crisis. At least, that would have been moving the franchise forward. This movie has lost the chemistry and therefore lost the comedy.

One thing I did like was the way they worked in the concept of the treasure hunt into the story line after Mitch (Billy Crystal), Phil (Daniel Stern) and Greg (Jon Lovitz) all thought they really were on to a million dollar discovery. Along the way, the picture makes clever use of geography and terrain to support the Western Pacific Railroad robbery saga, and references to The Treasure of the Sierra Madre were entertaining and well placed.You probably had to see the first movie in order to appreciate some of the repeat gags offered by Mitch and Phil on the trail like programming a VCR, and an early scene with Mitch running along side of Norman wouldn't have made any sense without having done so. Crystal manages once again to plug his admiration for Mickey Mantle while wearing a Mets cap, and when he simulated that drag under the runaway wagon it brought to mind all those B Westerns for which Yakima Canutt invented the gimmick.There's at least one takeaway I got from the picture that makes it memorable; I'll bet this is the only movie ever made in which a character uses the word 'pi--pot'. It occurs when Duke (Palance) gets irritated over the boys whining about how cold it is as they try to figure out a way to warm up. Right around the same time Duke doubled me over when he described how his mother died, stabbed in a bar fight at ninety five. The imagery there is simply impossible. Go ahead, try it.

Billy Crystal is much more reserved here though, and Jon Lovitz did irritate me. The flaws however come in mainly the basic plot structure, I know the first film had a simple story structure but this one had more so and the direction which isn't as skillful or as efficient this time around. Another problem was the pacing, while the film's length itself is fine there are times when the film does drag and badly.

Burn the sets, kill minor actors. If you are someone who enjoys watching this, drink heavily. You got nothing going for you.

All I can say is that the movie studio heads saw the $$$$$ the original made and thinking that another one would profit just as much,regardless if the script was good at all or not.

Unfortunately, I found this film just not funny or emotional enough, and it felt a bit unoriginal. There are some things that had potential, such as Billy Crystal thinking he sees his old friend Curly at several places, as well as his dream at the beginning of the film, which was worth a few laughs. One problem is that the jokes just do not feel original here, and this film uses the exact same gag from the previous film in which Crystal mouths the words his mother says when she calls on the phone. Neither Crystal or Daniel Stern is very funny here. Jack Palance is pretty good, but not flawless as with the previous movie that won him an Oscar. One downfall to this film is the addition of Jon Lovitz, who cannot act and behave like a child most of the time. There were good scenes, such as Palance discussing his relationship with his brother and such, but ultimately the film becomes cheesy and anticlimactic. There are some fairly off-color scenes as well, one thing that earned this film a PG-13 rating. If you want my advice, stick with the original, a funny film that had good jokes, emotion, and even some lessons, and somehow felt like an original, good comedy.**1/2 out of **** "},{"Title":"Could have been better!","Date":"1 January 2009","Score":"2 out of 4 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Western","Review":" Every so often you get a sequel to a really good movie that is even better than the original; sadly this is not one of them.The gags are more crude than subtle, and stretched till all the stupid people get them, to the point of discomfort, and redoing the VCR gag that was great first time round was a crime against comedy.I loved the first film and after waiting 15 years to catch CS2 I have to say I was disappointed. The start is slow and bogged down by domestic issues that did not contribute to the plot in any meaningful fashion.CS1 was uplifting, CS2 is a predictable repeat and subtracts from your fondness for the characters as they discover greed.Thankfully Jack Palance lived on to make a few more films after this for us to remember him by, may he rest in peace.

It made about a third of the money that CS I did.The film starts with a Mitch (Billy Crystal) dreaming about Curly (Jack Palance) coming out of his grave; Mitch wakes up a wreck that Curly was buried alive. He shakes himself out of it. It's his 40th birthday, and we can see that his life has changed and he's much happier as he jogs in the morning with Norman, the steer he saved.It's a rocky day at the station. He has gotten Phil (Daniel Stern) a job there, but it's not working out and he's afraid he will have to fire him. Phil is down because of his divorce, so Mitch invites him to the house. On the train home, Mitch could swear that he sees Curly.When he gets home, he sees that his lower brother Glen (Jon Lovitz) is there. Looking forward to a romantic evening with his wife (Patricia Wettig), Mitch ultimately sends Glen off with Phil. Later, he goes through the things he still has of Curly's and finds a treasure map.Before you know it, Mitch, Glen, and Phil are out looking for the treasure, eventually getting help from Curly's twin brother Duke. Like Mitch's own brother Glen, Duke was the black sheep of his family.Funny film with Lovitz and Crystal in fine form, and another good performance by Palance. Lots of good one-liners and amusing premises, along with some pathos. Thanks to the actors, the film retained the warmth of the first movie with likable characters.Enjoyable, if not as good as the first. "}{"Title":"Razzie award!!!????

Don't get me wrong, I really like the first movie and I own it, but watching it again and noticing the jokes in it, pretty much it was all bitching and complaining about their sex lives and their mid life criss-es. And Bruno Kirby is a funny guy, but his character Ed wouldn't stop convincing Mitch to do all these crazy things and asking him ridiculous questions like the woman in the rocket ship and the Kellogs super pack. Pretty much the funniest one (and most unfortunate one) is probably Phil (Daniel Stern). ARLENE YOU'RE CRAZY! PHIL THAT'S RIGHT! NOT HAVING SEX FOR 12 YEARS WILL DO THAT TO A PERSON! hilarious, brilliantly hilarious.However, in this movie, the jokes were very well thought, well expressed and sarcastic and frank at the same time. That to me is impressing. GLEN Hey guys! How do you think those two laughing idiots we rented all this stuff from are going to feel when we bring home all that gold? MITCH Yeah, the looks on those tobacco chewin', gun rack having, chicken screwin', sister marryin', abandoned bathroom in the front yard leaving, vitamin deficientcied ugly faces! That has to be the best description of two dumbass hicks. There are tons of other jokes in this movie that wish I could recite. I do admit that I was disappointed in a lot of the characters or some recognizable cast were in only in the movie for a very short period of time but thats about it. Anway thats pretty much all I can say about that.

Along the way, they are aided by the twin brother (Jack Palance) of the cowboy that had accompanied them on their previous adventure.

There is a good story line all the way through with a nice mix of comedy and life. I think Billy Crystal, Daniel Stern and Jon Lovitz are great actors and they act very well in &#145;City Slickers II The Legend of Curly's Gold'. It is the follow-up to &#145;City Slickers' but what's great is you don't have to watch the first movie to understand the second, even though there are links between the two. I do think the first was a bit better than this one, but like I said; this one is still great. Thankfully it still has a happy ending, even though it looks as though it won't (woops, just spoilt it for you) so it's a nice happy family movie that will leave you feeling good.If you are planning to watch both movies, I would recommend watching the first one first, but you don't need to. If you like happy family movies certainly rent it, and if it is on TV definitely watch it.

In this movie Mitch and friends went looking for gold. Mitch had found a treasure map inside Curly's old hat. There is a new character in the movie, Mitch &#145;s brother Glen Jon Lovitz (SNL). The issue of sibling rivalry is well explored. Little by little his friends keep showing up one by one except for Bruno Kirby (When Harry met Sally). I wonder what happened to him? The movie is fun, full of great lines. Most people do not like sequels but I believe thematically that this movie follows the first one well and also keeps the audience laughing all the way to the end. I think it is a fine movie. Perhaps because I have a great sense of humor and tend to giggle a lot.  My favorite quotes Mitch I am petrified of heights that is why I am not tall!

Needless to say, there's a series of silly situations along the way.I guess that I wouldn't call this movie god-awful - the comments about trying to milk the cow were pretty funny - but they really didn't need to make this sequel; the original was just fine.

The first City Slickers was a thoughtful comedy. It focuses on a human story and laughs. It wasn't surprising to find the laughs come full-circle in this sequel. I found this sequel even more hilarious, but let's not say it's better, because there's hardly any difference. This sequel reunites only two stars from the original. Billy Crystal and Daniel Stern, reprising the roles of Mitch and Phil. Mitch is now 40 years-old, and bored with hi life, until he finds a dirty old treasure inside the hat of their dead partner Curly. Of course it's worth millions. of course they'll go out and find it (and than do the I found the gold! dance from The Treasure of the Sierra Madre), some the plot elements are familiar, but the laughs more than make up for it. Jack Palance, doing the role of the brother of his character in the original. And Jon Lovitz portrays the role of Mitch's overreacting brother. So far those elements quite work. Rating *** out of 5.

I say this because City Slickers II, unlike City Slickers, is presented as a comedy, and is funny, thanks largely to the talents of Jon Lovitz, as Mitch's brother. The first film, in my opinion, tried to be a serious film, within the context of being a comedy, as the main characters reflect on their lives as they ride along the trail on their horses.To me, this made the film stilted and pretentious. There was none of this in the sequel.We get pure comedy. I think the film also benefited from the inclusion of Lovitz, and the absence of Bruno Kirby, whose character I found to be annoying in the first film. (I mean no disrespect toward Kirby, who recently passed away) Also, the DVD contains a good commentary by Crystal and Lovitz, whereas the first film has no commentary. "}]
