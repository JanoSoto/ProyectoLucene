[{"Title":"Engaging Performances By Judd And Jackman","Date":"10 April 2001","Score":"25 out of 29 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Romance","Review":"  	It's nice to go to a fancy restaurant where you can sit down and have a big, juicy steak with all the trimmings, or a gourmet meal served on fine china.  But sometimes you just feel like checking out the pizza buffet, and when the atmosphere is right and the pizza turns out to be perfect, it can be every bit as satisfying as haute cuisine.  And that's the way it is with `Someone Like You,' directed by Tony Goldwyn and starring Ashley Judd, Greg Kinnear and Hugh Jackman.  If you just want to relax and be entertained, with a movie that's not too challenging and let's you just go with the flow, then you've come to the right buffet.  Ashley Judd is Jane Goodale, who begins a relationship with new co-worker Ray (Kinnear) that goes so well so quickly that she thinks it's going to last forever.  And when it suddenly goes south for no apparent reason, she is crushed.  Why did Ray jilt her?  Was it just her, or is this just the way `Men' are?  Her musings on the subject ultimately lead to the formulation of what she calls the `New Cow' theory, which basically states that once men, like bulls, have had the cow, they move on to yet another `new' cow, leaving the `old' cow behind.  Realizing, of course, that lacking sufficient data her concept would never hold up to any real scientific scrutiny, she is afforded the chance to study it further when-- due to the circumstances of her breakup with Ray-- she finds herself without an apartment, and moves in with another co-worker, Eddie (Jackman).  And Eddie is a notorious womanizer who seems to have a `new cow' every other day.  Along the way, as Jane draws her final conclusions, there are some memorable-- and at times, humorous-- moments, like when Jane revives one of her old cheerleader routines for Eddie.  But whether or not she is able to prove her theory doesn't really make any difference; the important thing is, you'll have a good time going along with her while she tries.   	There's nothing very deep here, the plot is familiar in the genre of romantic comedy, and Goldwyn certainly doesn't break any new ground with it.  He keeps things moving right along, but uses a straightforward approach to tell the story that is fairly unimaginative and lacks the distinction of say, a Nora Ephron film.  Still, it's a good bit of entertainment, carried by the engaging performances of Judd and Jackman, which alone makes it worth the price of admission.  Judd is a wholesome beauty with a natural appeal, and she can act; Jackman is charismatic and has a definite screen presence.  And there's chemistry between the two of them that make it work.  There's no real surprises along the way, but it's like taking your favorite scenic drive; you've seen it all before, but it's pleasant and fun, and in the end you're glad you took the trip.  	The supporting cast includes Ellen Barkin (Diane), Marisa Tomei (Liz), Matthew Coyle (Staff Member), Hugh Downs (Himself) and LeAnna Croom (Rebecca).  When you put it all into perspective, you realize that `Someone Like You' is actually a real treat.  And Goldwyn, though he may not have given it that `special' touch, should be given credit for delivering a solid, uplifting and entertaining movie that is well worth seeing.  It may not be in the same league as `Return To Me,' or `You've Got Mail,' but if you've ever been subjected to bottom-of-the-genre-feeders like `The Bachelor,' or `The Wedding Planner,' you'll definitely appreciate this one for what it is.  It's warm and funny, and it'll leave you with a good feeling inside and a smile on your face.  And that, my friends, is the magic of the movies.  I rate this one 7/10.

Judd's recent films, `Eye of the Beholder' and  `Double Jeopardy', placed her in mortal danger and were deadly serious, to say the least. Her current project gives her a lighter air portraying a young working woman charged with the task of getting interesting guests for a morning talk show hosted by Diane (Ellen Barkin). In the film's humorous introduction, Jane (Judd) explains the Old cow/new cow theory that she applies to men and their relationships with women. Basically, The theory says that once a bull mates with a cow (old cow) subsequently he only wants another Cow (new cow). At the job she falls for Ray (Greg Kinnear). She is the new cow to him. Meanwhile, she shares an apartment with Eddie (charismatic Hugh Jackman, recently of X-Men). Complications ensue and the finale is predictable. Performances are on the mark and the settings in Manhattan are real (not faux Toronto) adding to the film's charm. In addition, the men are treated fairly, not making this a total chick flick. There is also a sparkling performance by Marisa Tomei as Jane's best friend.  The costumes are also what a $40,000/yr. salary could afford, as opposed to Armani and other designer duds. As directed by Tony Goldwyn (the bad guy in `Ghost') `Someone Like You' is a delightful way to spend a couple of hours. There are no surprises, some smiles and chuckles, and you'll feel good because the characters are basically nice folks.

The trailers looked so charming and funny yet when you actually sit down and see the movie from start to finish you're left wondering what happened. You have an incredibly talented actress in Ashley Judd and Hugh Jackman is going to be the next big star from Australia. The rest of the cast is no slouch either but I can't help but believe that this movie lost out on writing.Someone Like You is about finding out what makes men do the things they do in relationships (or the beginning of relationships) and of course falling in love. Jane Goodale (Ashley Judd) is a producer for a talk show that can't just seem to find a long lasting relationship. We meet her at the beginning of the movie as she meets the new executive producer, Ray Brown (Greg Kinnear). Sparks instantly ignite between the two and they soon enter into a serious relationship that has them moving in together. No sooner than that happens, Brown breaks up with Goodale, plunging her into a depressive state that has her searching to find out why this happened.Did you notice that nowhere in that little summary did I mention Hugh Jackman's character, Eddie Alden? And that's the odd thing about this movie. The trailers clearly show that Judd and Jackman are the main characters of this movie (and of course, end up together) but when you actually see it, Jackman isn't in it nearly as prominently as the trailer indicates. For most of the first half of the movie we see Judd and Kinnear and we're introduced to Jackman's character as the resident playboy of the company but that's about the extent of it. There's enough dialogue that we get a sense of what Eddie's like but not a lot. After the break-up between Judd and Kinnear we begin to see more of Judd and Jackman but only as roommates, nothing more. There are little hints here and there that something is developing but it isn't nearly enough to cause them to fall madly in love with each other by the end. For a romantic comedy there wasn't enough interaction between the characters that are supposed to fall in love with each other.There's not much to say about Ashley Judd. She's an incredible actor and does well with the material she's given. Marisa Tomei is in this movie as Judd's best friend and she does a wonderful job with the amount of screen time she's given. She seems to be making a bit of a comeback in the movie industry and hopefully we see more of her. Kinnear is good as the consummate `nice-guy' but we've seen him do this role many times before, so much so that I'm getting the feeling that he's getting type-cast, you think? Jackman's last movie was X-men and he's turning out to be quite the good actor. He doesn't have a large number of lines and in many of the scenes, he just gives a look or a quirky smile but he's able to say a lot with those looks. He also has a talent for American accents, which will help him with his career in Hollywood. Look for big things to come from this actor.Overall, this movie is mediocre. The potential was there but somewhere along the way, it suffered a bit of an identity crisis. Is it a romantic comedy or a drama or maybe even a dramatic comedy??? Who knows? This is a good matinee to go to but not worth full admission.

Since I don't even remember it being in the theaters (though my daughter does), I assumed it was going to be a bit lame.  And if I had read the reviews I've found posted here first, I would have been even MORE hesitant about watching it.                              Instead, I quickly found myself being led into a satirical funny movie, that had me laughing aloud (I'm the type of person that DOES think it's funny to hear chirping birds when Ashley Judd first stares into the smarmy but cute eyes of Greg Kinnear, while the word 'Attraction' is flashed across the screen like a card from a Silent Movie).  I thought Ashley Judd was a great comedienne in this film, especially the scene where she was drunk at the bar.  She plays angry loud drunk female very well.                                    There were also plenty of sight gags.  Am I the only one who laughed at the sight of Hugh Jackman nailing up a blanket over the horrendous hole in the wall in his apartment?  Ashley having to schlep her luggage down the street to her new apartment?  The seating arrangements in the conference room at the workplace, showing the changes in each couple's relationships?  Honest, I laughed at almost every scene in this film.                                          It turns out this movie is based on the book Animal Husbandry, a witty little novella that can be read in a day, which is written like a journal in the life of Jane.  In the book, the character of Eddie remains always intriguing, always fascinating, and always a bit out of reach.  Hugh Jackman attempts to put some of that swagger and inscrutable mystery into his characterization.  It's an intriguing role, and not really an easy one to play, but Hugh as usual does a great job.  His character is emphasized much more in the film than in the book.  Greg Kinnear, as Ray plays it a little too tongue-in-cheek, but the scenes where he's talking to the camera are priceless.  And Ashley Judd plays 'Jane' in a more sympathetic and believable light than the heroine of the novel was portrayed.                                                                                     To me, the movie flowed well, and the ending was just fine.  It's fun to watch the 'Alternate Ending' on the DVD, though, with Director's Commentary.  Once you've heard the director explain that wet cotton-snow, green trees in January, and bad rain special-effects mean an ending has to be trashed, you can't help but laugh.  Not only that, but Hugh Jackman looks good wet, too.

After this many viewings, you catch a lot of points that escape notice on earlier viewings.What starts to stand out is the stupidity of the Ashley Judd character 'Jane Goodale'. She is the helpless captive of her emotions, seeming to learn little from bitter experience. She feels an instant attraction to the Greg Kinnear character 'Ray Brown'. She eagerly accepts a lunch invitation from a man she knows is already involved with another woman. When 'Ray' calls her at home, 'Jane' drops everything to spend the night with him. 'Jane' never requires any form of commitment from this man. Any scrap of his attention is sufficient to keep her available. Call it the triumph of hormones over logic.After being dumped, 'Jane' mopes around being miserable. It seems that her horizons are limited to the workplace when seeking a mate. In a city the size of New York, an attractive young woman can't find any desirable man to hook up with. It seems unlikely that she would fail to attract any outside attention at all.'Ray Brown' is no mental giant either. Getting involved with a co-worker and then dumping her under such ugly circumstances is very likely to result in major problems at the work place. Being secretly involved with his boss 'Diane Roberts' and then breaking off with 'Diane' to pursue co-worker 'Jane' is not a brilliant career move, to put it mildly. 'Diane' was bound to find out about 'Ray's' new relationship in such a small work group. The Hugh Jackman character 'Eddy Alden' was enormously reckless. He publicly returns a pair of co-worker 'Nina's' earrings, left in his bathroom. That humiliation could have hardly failed to arouse repercussions for 'Eddy'. 'Eddy' spends all his time and money in the pursuit of new female conquests. He seems to subsist on a diet of Chinese takeout food, cigarettes, and liquor. That lifestyle can hardly fail to take a toll on his looks and health, vital to the success of a playboy of moderate financial resources.What stands out in the lives of these major characters is just a shallow regard for the pleasure of the moment. Not one of them seems to desire establishing a stable marriage relationship. A sure recipe for eventual heartbreak.'Jane' eventually refocuses romantically on her despised roommate 'Eddy'. 'Jane' has lavished all her disdain and rage toward men on 'Eddy'. It seems that 'Eddy' never holds a grudge for all the caustic quips 'Jane' aimed in his direction. When 'Jane' hits rock bottom emotionally, a suddenly gallant 'Eddy' finds reason to comfort her in her hour of need. A bit of decent behavior and sympathy from 'Eddy' is enough to cause 'Jane' to switch her romantic sights onto him. It seems that a man only needs to provide some emotional support and 'Jane' is putty in his hands.The conclusion of the film was strange. 'Jane' suddenly realizes she is in love with 'Eddy' and dashes out of the workplace to find him and declare her love. The fact that they live in the same apartment and will certainly soon cross paths seems irrelevant to her frantic haste. The director's comments track mentions that there was another ending to the film that was discarded. I certainly would have appreciated a chance to see the alternate ending and judge it for myself. I feel it probably was superior to the version presented.

In order to make it a more palatable movie, director Tony Goldwyn de-fanged the sharp bite of the book where all men are deemed scum and there is no happy, Hollywood romantic pairing waiting for heroine Jane Goodale (played by Ashley Judd on screen). But to the benefit of the film, toning down the book's bile makes Jane less an unlikable, dithering neurotic and more of a likable kook.Ashley Judd does an excellent job with the script by combining emotional vulnerability and a solid comedic presence. She is at all times cute and adorable without sending a viewer into sugar shock. Hugh Jackman, in his first post-X-men role, brings a certain roguish charm and charisma to the chain-smoking and chain-f***ing Eddie. Besides her co-worker and roommate, Eddie is also Jane Goodale's living, breathing proof of her wacky theory that men are neophiliacs, and lose interest in women once they have `been serviced.' (She calls this her New Cow theory.). When Hugh Jackman and Ashley Judd are both on screen, the chemistry between them crackle. It adds a depth and nuance to their performances and characters' development. Too bad we are denied the pleasure of seeing them consummate their eventual (and very obvious) romantic pairing.Greg Kinnear does a good job of combining slimy and sincere as the man who breaks Jane's heart, and starts her spiraling toward her New Cow theory. Marisa Tomei steals every scene she is in as Jane's enabler, best buddy, and fellow soldier in the romantic war. Marisa's chain-smoking Liz makes one wish that the movie was from her point of view, and that we could have watched cynical Liz trade verbal jabs and longing looks with Jackman's equally cynical Eddie.The subplot concerning Alice's, Jane's sister,  infertility troubles doesn't add much to the plot of the movie except to show at least one man (Stephen, played by Peter Friedman) in a steady and monogamous relationship. Catherine Dent, who plays Danni in the F/X drama The Shield and Jane's sister, has the best line in the movie If you can't stick that needle in a Valencia, how are you going to stick in my ass?'Someone Like You' isn't as forgettable as the lame title suggests, because of top notch performances of its stars and some memorable lines. You want fall off your seat laughing, but you will find yourself with at least a pleasing smile on your face.

If it had been as over the top as its visual emphasis on cattle and its crackpot neofeminist theory, this might have been a laugh-out-loud comedy - with a de-emphasis on the romantic part of the genre.  By trying to give it a happy (and yet somehow ridiculously predictable) ending, it fails both as romance and comedy.I can't fault the director for wanting to capitalize on the talents of Ashley Judd, Greg Kinnear, and Hugh Jackman, but the chemistry is non-reactive between Judd and Kinnear, and I suspect the only chemistry I saw in Jackman was the magnetism he wields regardless of the identity of his onscreen partner.  Whatever catalyst - whether pure good acting rapport or device of script - was needed to make this film complete never got introduced.  Judd seems lost and uneven as the befuddled and dumped Jane, deeply convincing only when she's sad and phoning it in when her character is supposed to be experiencing joy and love.  The payoff at the end of the film - which you're expecting within the first 20 minutes - is too long in coming and too abbreviated to be worth the wait.  The one true surprise of the film also comes too late to capitalize on the kind of tension and intrigue it might have allowed if revealed earlier.On the other hand, it's the little touches that made watching the movie fun even while I was knitting my brow at its mistakes.  (The very sensitive might consider the following spoilers.)  There's nothing subtle about the womanizing Eddie living in a loft above a meat market, but it has its snicker value, as do the various shots of cows all throughout the film, underscoring Jane's old cow theory.  There are some excellent musical choices, including a very surprising few bars of the Magnetic Fields' quirky ballad Absolutely Cuckoo.  Marisa Tomei's best-friend role is probably meant to provide counterpoint, but she really only succeeds at comic relief. Ellen Barkin is believable and enjoyable as the older, wiser woman of the film, although her viewpoint is relegated to a single speech and we develop an interest in her far too late.Above all, this movie is watchable for Jackman's Eddie - I am not sure whether it was a choice or serendipity that, through the whole film, we can never quite bring ourselves to dislike him, despite how we are constantly led by the nose to believe we should.

He carried it off well though.As for Hugh Jackman, he reminds me so much of Matt LeBlanc I think he could replace him on Friends and no one would notice.  He was not really inspired in his acting and seemed to be going through the motions as well.Marissa Tomei was excellent in her role, AS USUAL, She brings characters to life. I think if we switched her and Ashley Judd in their roles this would have been a much better movie.  I thought Marissa and Helen Hunt could have switched roles in What Women Want and made that one better.  It would be great if these casting people would someday put the best actor or actress in a movie in the lead role. Ellen Barkin deserves mention for a great, but brief, role in this one.All in all the people and characters which were good were lost in the lame script and the lame acting from the lead characters.  Although it was at times entertaining, and not painful to watch, it just wasn't anything but mediocre.Tony Goldwyn is good at playing his slimey bad guy type when he acts in a film and he should stick to it, because he has no skills what-so-ever in the directing department.

Her narration announces that the 'cow theory' &#150; that men are polygamous and won't go back to an old lover &#150; took over her entire life due to a broken heart. This would be more believable if the 'cow theory' actually did take over her entire life. Instead, she comes up with the ungrounded theory, is told it isn't a very good theory repeatedly since all she has to do is look around at say, more than one man, and refuses to admit it could be wrong because if it is, men don't leave all women, they just leave her &#150; well, it would be nice if there is any sign of this other than the one break-up within the film.Then there is the broken heart that sparks all this. It doesn't help that her relationship with Ray (Greg Kinnear) is performed entirely in montages, so the audience can never tell what is so great about it. The editor should have been advised to leave in the deleted scene of Ray telling Jane how he can't stop thinking about her, as as it is, I was never sure why he is with Jane. He tells her that he is in a serious three-year relationship to the one, Jane proceeds to have an affair with Ray, Ray dumps the one, is clearly distraught, then dumps Jane and she is surprised. She was planning on moving in with a guy in a serious relationship, what did she expect to happen? As for the characters themselves, Jane is an uninteresting lead and Eddie (Hugh Jackman), the womanising housemate who is obviously going to end up with her, doesn't have a coherent personality. His inevitable pairing with Jane seems to happen because she only knows two other men, and they're both taken.Judd and Kinnear have plenty of chemistry, but there is none between Judd and Jackman, which is a huge problem. Also, an odd quirk of the film is that Ray is the nicest Mr Wrong in rom-com history and he would make a more interesting lead than Jane or Eddie.Animal Attraction desperately tries to adhere to standard rom-com formula and then, as if to break away enough to be remembered, it tries to be quirky, with narration, title cards and mildly surreal elements. Unfortunately, there isn't enough fun in the film to carry these, and the dreary rom-com soundtrack and forgettable names bog it down. A forgettable collapsed soufflé of a film.

A show known as Cheaters showed that 50% of husbands and boyfriends cheat and 60% of girlfriends and wives cheat. This statistic was based specifically on the tens of thousands of people their field of service is contracted under to investigate such suspicions which means, these are confirmed cases making these statistics based on fact. The primary difference was the way they cheat and what they also found was, men were far more likely to admit to it where as women were not. Movies like this are absolutely ridiculous and brainwashing. It's a world where all men only want sex, all women want love and romance and of course, never use men for sex, money, social identity, career opportunities or any other such selfish superficial purpose. This movie also gives us good reason to hate these mainstream commercial actors because they're willing to sign on to such toxic material. The fact is, they live in the real world not this b.s. world where the story takes place and they know what a crock it is. Just the same, a few million dollars and residuals for life are of course reason enough to spread this battle of the sexes propaganda through out the world.I do however think this movie is worth watching just once so you can scoff at it, the actors, writers and director. The opening scene starts with Naomi Judd comparing men to livestock, absolutely disgusting and insulting and more than enough reason to make us dislike her not simply just the character. Hopefully you're intelligent and deep enough to be offended by this movie and the stereotypes it sells as much as I was since it's a complete work of fiction totally void of reality.

Ashley Judd is passable. With her stiff, over-enunciated dialogue, she has never been a good actor and is not qualified for top billing in anything but (maybe) a direct-to-DVD romp, but she is at least *somewhat* stable here. Marisa Tomei is truly awful in her usual, annoying, ill-gotten-Oscar overacting, and Ellen Barkin gets the job done as always but plays an irritating character. The real starpower comes from the skillful Hugh Jackman, who was a newcomer at this time but provides the first of many lovable and convincing performances, the first of many bad boy/good guy roles that we love, and fodder for the first of many questions like, Why is he forever surrounded by so much inferior talent? Certainly, we would love to see him in more roles like this, and probably will, as he was recently sentenced to Sexiest Man Alive.As for Greg Kinear, never was Fry's comment more true I feel myself disappearing. Like... Greg Kinear !This film's premise is based on the broken heart of Jane Goodall, who becomes involved with Ray (Kinear) and is promptly dumped, but Ray has no depth or personality, and their attraction is never grounded in anything real or interesting, so it makes no sense for her to be in love in the first place, let alone be devastated by the loss or driven to analyze it for New Cow Theory. However, this film is worth a viewing for Jackman, and has some funny and great moments (most of which belong to him). It also covers some interesting new territory in the animal aspects of human relations. However, right about the time it becomes sexist and offensive, the animal theory is proved wrong, mankind is vindicated, and our heroes obey the romantic comedy cliché of getting together even though they don't seem compatible. The whole thing feels like a good idea executed with insufficient writing and script to cover the plot, which could have been great.Overall, definitely worth it as eye candy and a good laugh for chicks. Otherwise, a decent flick if you keep the FF Button close at hand to survive some of Tomei's more dreadful scenes. I have it at home and watch it whenever I need a light, pick-me-up type of film.

Probably the biggest weakness is the chopped-up nature of the script, which makes long periods of time pass far too quickly - it's hard to believe a relationship has lasted weeks when we've only see a couple together for about three minutes. The result is that the few half-baked subplots are even less relevant - but in its favour, this is a film that doesn't make you think too hard. The acting isn't too bad; Hugh Jackman plays his trademark cool and Marisa Tomei is excellent as always. The plot isn't strong, but not terrible; this one joins the ranks of films that are hard to criticise harshly but have few stand-out features.

She seemed indeed to turn over a new leaf in WHERE THE HEART IS, but that was way too much too abruptly and therefore a distraction from the movie. As I watched her playing that sweet docile passive typical resident of a fantastically idyllic little town, she did impress me, but I wished that impressiveness could be unencumbered by a constant awareness of the wild irony of her playing that role. But for all the chances of that happening, I might as well have been watching Robert Downey Jr. playing the president of the Partnership for a Drug-free America. Could Ashley instead ease into some persona more moderate and make a more long-term goal out of going for the versatility of a Meryl Streep? Perhaps that's what was being attempted in SOMEONE LIKE YOU. But it's a feeble attempt at best. As the staunch promoter of her theory about men and bulls, it seems her old original persona is back after a brief furlough where the heart was. And her determination with this men-and-bull theory can be best described as prove her point or prove a sore loser if she can't. This last movie of hers achieves some low-level watchability but very little that is highly memorable. It's one of those movies that didn't add a heck of a lot after seeing its previews.

That's not else in the world that can replace the great sensation of watching a good one. And that's just what it is. A very good romantic comedy. It has all the elements to make us fall in love with it. And so we do. The plot is really clever with a lot of twists. Jane works at a tv program and falls in love with Ray the minute she met him. They live like a perfect couple for six weeks and he asks her to live with him. When everything seemed to be perfect, he dumps her... Totally heartbroken, with no place to live, her only option is to be roommate with her friend Eddie. Still without understanding what went wrong in her relationship, Jane comes up with a theory that explains why men leave women. From this point on, I don't have to say what will happen...It's perfect as an entertainment, but also has a lot of insights about the relationship between man and woman. Every woman will relate to Jane and her attempt to find the love of her life while every men seem to be there to break her heart. Ashley Judd is so beautiful and sweet and talented and funny. I'm already a fan. Greg Kinnier is just as charming as he always is. Marisa Tomei is back with everything, the role is perfect for her, though it's small, but I'm sure we'll get to see her many times on screen again.

(WARNING SOME SPOILERS, although they're easy enough to detect from the trailer)The premise of the film is that a talent booker (Judd) for a daytime talkshow (that's recently gone from local NYC to national) meets a new producer and falls in love with him. She begins a relationship with him (at the advice of her best friend, a men's magazine editor, played by Marisa Tomei) DESPITE the fact that he's already in a relationship with another woman. Tomei's character's advice act like she doesn't exist -- meaning the ex-girlfriend. This doesn't bode well for the Ashley Judd character, Jane Goodale. At no point does she consider telling the producer, played by Greg Kinnear, that she'd like him to finish his previous relationship before they begin one.And they begin what is essentially a couple month long affair. By the time Kinnear's character tells his off-screen girlfriend, he's tired of Jane, who is then unceremoniously dumped. The bulk of the film centers on Jane's theory that bulls (aka men) only want a cow (women) once, as a new cow. The theory, which takes the nation by a storm, is simply not strong enough to merit this only-in-the-film sensation.With nowhere to live, she moves in platonically with yet another co-worker, the gorgeous, but hopeless womanizer Eddie (Hugh Jackman). Eddie has a stream of women coming in and out of bed and continues to justify his behavior (essentially by not talking about his true love, Becca, who walked out on him). None of this rings true, not for a minute.Jackman is certainly stunningly handsome, but his character is never played for more than a cad. There is a MINUTE of kindness between Eddie and Jane which is the basis for the not-in-a-minute believable romantic happy ending, which is completely tacked on.What a viewer would hope for in this kind of film is a credible build-up of a relationship of trust and compassion between Eddie and Jane -- it's the only way the ending can work -- and because director Tony Goldwyn (an actor himself) -- elects to ignore this, the film fails.

It must have been 6 months of anticipation, and it wasn't worth it. I am absolutely crazy about Hugh Jackman, but I don't think I would watch this movie again, not even because he's in it. I know romantic comedies are predictable; we know there's going to be a happy ending, but that's not what makes them so enjoyable. It's the meeting, the interaction between the characters (and credible dialogue is an important part of that) which persuades you that these two are meant for each other. The happy ending is just the confirmation, the more romantic the better (Dirty Dancing, 10 things I hate about you, etc). This one felt rushed and I actually thought that Jane was going to have to win back Eddie's affections after what she'd done, when suddenly the movie was over. I felt cheated. Apart from that, I thought they spent too much time on the relationship with Greg Kinnear's character. A whole half an hour? Hugh Jackman was supposed to be the star of the movie, and even if he wasn't on-screen with Ashley Judd, then he should be on-screen doing his own scenes. I was thoroughly bored with the beginning. I would have done it in flashback; have Jane start the movie having been dumped, and do the flashback in 5 minutes, or even better, gloss over it in 5 minutes, with a voice-over or something.This was a very average movie, and I was evenly thoroughly bored with the cheerleading scene. It was stupid; was that the best they could come up with? I'm disappointed in this movie (the change of title should actually have been a warning - Animal Husbandry would have been far better). I only hope that Swordfish and Paperback Hero are better films for Hugh Jackman, because this is one to be written off. They don't make romantic comedies like they used to.

Hugh jackmann with typical good looks and a charm that's irrestible watches judd as she breaks down and even ends up sharing his apartment with her. Their relationship is platonic and judd is still recovering from Kinnear's disinterest in her. Marisa Tomei walks with her as her best friend in this bitter phase of her life and encourages her to probe a little more into the cow theory of love and sex. Even though viewers are generally familiar with the concept that a man is always on the lookout for young and fresh love in his life, this movie gives it a nice pleasant finishing touch. The scenes between Judd's older sister and her brother-in-law in the hospital are quite sentimental and drive home the point that not all men are mean and waiting to dump their wives or lovers for fresh love. The interruption of the scenes with pieces of advice reminded me of Rob Reiner's When harry met Sally. On the whole, a pleasant movie.

It was like the first 5 or  10 minutes of Ashley Judd's acting was awful, and then she shaped up a bit. Also the movie seemed rather rushed, enter Jane (Ashley Judd), we barely get to know a thing about her and she started talking about Eddie (Hugh Jackman) and how he plays with woman. And then Ray (Greg Kenner) enters, and bing bang boom, they are dating. The movie gave us no time to get to know the characters personally, or even like the characters. For me it seemed that the all of the actors except Hugh Jackman really weren't into the movie. Like Greg Kenner seemed like he was bored to death the whole time and was only doing this movie for  fun. He didn't get into his character like he does in his other  movies, he just seemed to play it but wasn't into it. Ashley Judd  seemed rather bored or maybe she was just acting bad for no reason. She put no life into her character and even though there were several crying scenes,  those were the only scenes that Ashley Judd even got into. But over all the movie had a good ending and I was glad after all the disappointing stuff I had to wade through, it finally ended with a happy ending, a very  predictable ending, but a happy one.

And in their wisdom, cast two different styles of beefcake to keep our interests from straying to another theater.On one hand you have the almost veal- tender- like silky- smooth- charm of established buffet of male delicacies, Greg Kinnear. And on the other hand you've got that rough edged Angus cut filet of mansirloin with a smart scoop of tall, crisply blended into the boydish. I speak of Hugh Jackman.We gals are still wiping our brow from the X-Men dvd released a while ago!

Of course there are bad romantic comedies, or even stupid ones, but it is hard to make them so bad that I will not like them.Here the two stars are Ashley Judd and Hugh Jackman although we also have Marisa Tomei and Greg Kinnear. It is too bad that at the time the film was made Jackman was (and still is) such a huge star, otherwise the male lead could have been Kinnear as well. We know Tomei will not be the leading lady after three minutes or after we have seen the film poster that shows us nothing but a title and Ashley Judd. You might think I have spoiled some points of the film for you but romantic comedies are not whether the two stars will come together but how they will do that. Like I said, it follows a formula where the right people appear on exactly the right time to make sure the two stars will not get together within the ninety minutes.The story is not that original, or actually not original at all, but there are enough funny moments to keep your attention. Ashley Judd is Jane, dating Ray (Greg Kinnear), a man from work. Eddie (Hugh Jackman) also works there. He is quite the womanizer and of course at first Jane is not his biggest fan. But due circumstances she moves in with him and slowly they start liking each other. Along the way we meet Jane's good friend Liz (Maria Tomei) and we find some bumps on the road to get the stars together. By the way, there is a big secret too, mainly there to build a story around it.Kinnear and Tomei are dependable actors and here they show that once again. All Jackman and Judd have to do is look cool and beautiful. They both succeed. Jackman is the perfect tough guy, as showed in 'X-Men' and Judd is always fun to watch. This is mainly her film.

As the self-pitying main character ridiculously named Jane Goodall Judd makes a trite and extended comparison between all men and polygamous bulls. The only thing more simple-minded than her sexist theory and pathetic self-pitying behavior over her fickle ex-boyfriend is that the filmmakers thought we would enjoy sitting through two hours of uninspired dialogue and emotional detachment. With the exception of Marisa Tomei's spirited performance and Naomi Judd's cameo as an over-achieving makeup artist, the movie is uniformly mis-cast Judd who usually gives nuanced performances is here cardboard-cold and cutesy-cute, (Greg) Kinnear is flat (although he was fantastic in As Good as It Gets), and Hugh Jackman seemed more natural as a Wolverine. What's worse than the self-pitying truly anti-feminist (proud women don't vilify men) insipidness of this film is tries to be not only amusing, but also smart.

Additionally, it is full of pseudo-clever visual puns like the preponderance of food especially meat (the physical embodiment of Jane's objectifying view of men as chattel), the somewhat more subtle squirming frog (reminiscent of all those disguised fairy tale princes) and of course the obvious cows, cows, cows. Ashley Judd is cute doing cheers in her underwear, but next time she should pick a movie that inspires cheering.For more entertainment, I suggest watching milk commercials. It does a body good. If you are looking for a good romantic comedy, I recommend any of the following When Harry Met Sally, The Princess Bride, Fools Rush In, Bridget Jones Diary.  If you need an Ashley Judd fix Double Jeopardy for suspense, Where the Heart is for comedy (simple-minded but actually charming), Ruby in Paradise for drama.

Relationships are a very hard thing to work out at the best of times, but when you try and analyze them it makes it even harder. Someone like you is one of the great romantic comedy's I have seen in the past two years, and by enjoying it, I also learnt a valuable lesson, that the special person in your life might be closer than you think.Jane Goodale is a talk show talent scout whose shaky love-life drives her into an intensive study of the curious mating habits of the male animal. From there, dizzyingly sexy complications ensue when her research turn into a revered love guru &#150; and lands her smack in between two hunky heart-throbs,                                               co-workers, Eddie and Ray.This movie is a great film to look at when you are feeling a bit down and like you are the one person who is out of luck in the relationship game. The script of someone like you is great in how it lifts you up and makes happy, but also brings you down slowly (and if you are a person who cries in the movies, can make you cry a little too). The script was very well written by Elizabeth Chandler, who brought the book `Animal Husbandry' perfectly to life. This book would be a very good read. Someone like you had a very delightful cast. The main star was the cheerful Ashley Judd, who played the heart&#150;broken Jane. Judd was very good in her role. Every time she was onscreen in this film, I could not help but fall in love with her character. I have enjoyed Judd in other movies such as Kiss the Girls and Double Jeopardy. Then you have undoubtedly the biggest star to Hollywood in years, that being Hugh Jackman. He was great as Eddie, the male that enjoyed spreading around his seed. Hugh has had a very big couple of years. Of course his role in the comic book movie, X-Men, was exceptional, while he has been alongside Movie legend John Travolta in the action film, Swordfish. Hugh has also done some good Aussie films, which include The Paperback Hero and Erskineville Kings just to name a few. Then you have the other male co-star Greg Kinnear, who played the low-life boyfriend, Ray. He was also good in his role. Greg has appeared in such movies like Loser (which was a little disappointing in my view), in addition to As Good As It Gets and You've Got Mail.There are some very funny (and sad) scenes in this film. The end of the movie is exceptional, with the way that Jane exposes herself as the mastermind behind the whole author scheme. In addition the way that Jane is dumped by Ray, was for the audience, sad and funny. Yet, I also felt that Jackman and Judd suited each other beautifully      on-screen, and that made the film all the more special. In summary, Someone like you is a film that can appeal to almost any age group, the young and old at heart. Love is an emotion that is terribly hard to control and shake off, if you can find that &#145;special' person to be in love with. No matter how or where you meet a person, I believe everyone can find that special someone to be with. If you want to have a good night's entertainment, hire this sexy and stylish romantic comedy.Rating 4.5 stars or 9/10   "},{"Title":"Oh boy.....","Date":"4 January 2002","Score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Romance","Review":"  God I love Ashley Judd - she is the reason I went to see this movie....unfortunately.

The premise is tired Girl meets boy, girl gets boy, boy gets cold feet and ditches girl, girl loses NY apartment and has to room up with office bad boy...what do think happens next?  This is a no brainer and quite frankly an insult to the audience and women to boot hey gals, listen up if the guy you like is dating another gal, but he still sees you that makes him a two timer and not a safe romantic bet.  Here's some more advice if he asks you to move in with him and the new place ain't lined up yet, ditch the dweeb.  But no, Ashley's character is as dumb as a box of hammers and jumps in anyway - losing the man and the apartment.  Of course we have the requisite badboy/lothario here that is repulsive to her but.....that's because she 'really doesn't know him'....this character is as tired as the 'hooker with a heart of gold' cliche but Jackman brings fresh life and real dimension. You end up wondering more about his character than Judd's.  Marisa Tomei is wonderful and delivers some of the best lines in the movie - why she didn't get more screentime is beyond me.  On the DVD check out the 'alternative ending' which was really the original ending until some yutz in marketing decieded that one small test audience should dictate to the rest of us, much better, much more romantic and much better music......

She's one of the chimps.  She's a career girl with a high powered position on a TV talk show who spends zero time thinking about her career, because her mind is on only one topic finding Mr. Right.  How she got through high school without getting knocked up is baffling.It doesn't matter, though,because her character is cotton candy, with no beginning and no real place in the world, even though they give her the mandatory best friend and a sister, too.  There's nothing to her.The trouble is, Jane a tower of complexity compared to the rest of the people who populate this film.Greg Kinnear, the first guy she falls for, looks like he stepped out of an underwear ad in Sunday's newspaper.

Hugh Jackman, who plays the supposedly shallow womanizer who really isn't, isn't anything else, either.

Aside from being funny and touching, the movie does give something to think about, not in the theory of animal husbandry (which is treated seriously, not as a joke), but in the response to that. As a woman, I was slapped in the face by the comments made by Hugh Jackman's Eddie to Ashley Judd in one particular scene late in the film. And don't let the trailer and press fool you - Eddie's not the typical womanizer, in fact he's not one at all. He was a pleasantly complex character that I fell in love with partly because he made me re-examine myself, and because of the strong acting of the absolutely darling Hugh Jackman, who was the principal reason I went to this movie in the first place. His excellent acting and the writing makes Eddie the most in-depth character, and believe me Hugh Jackman is very impressive, a great, human departure from Wolverine which only affirmed that I will be standing in line when Swordfish comes out in June, and probably when any other movie with this stellar favorite actor of mine comes out.Go see this movie - if not for the thinking, then at least to have a great time, and come out feeling good.

Jane Goodale (if you don't get the pun, it will be explained to you) presents as revolutionary the following theory the males of most species tend towards polygamy more than the females do.  Gasp!

Gosh.This stale chestnut actually has a sound basis (and an interesting set of explanations) in evolutionary theory, something which Jane (who searches far and wide for anything that will license her to draw analogies between humans and other animals) and the film studiously fail to mention.  The overall combination is a strange one.  There's a late twentieth-century delight in daring to talk openly and apparently without restrictions about sex, a c.2001 terror of showing any naughty bits (the only respect in which the film is truly of its time), and an attitude towards Darwin that might have made sense in 1850, when nobody had heard of him.For a whatever works for you film it's also staunchly and unconvincingly faithful to the worst conventions of romantic comedy (that's a compound noun; I don't mean to imply the presence of either romance or comedy), including the bit where the man suddenly walks away so that the woman can chase him, and the bit where the woman suddenly walks away so that the man can chase her.

But, it's definitely one of the worst 100 films I have ever seen.The acting is poor, the story-line is shoddy, it's completely slow, and so predictable, that you can almost lip sync what they are going to say next. Take my advice and other's on here as well. Avoid this one at any and all costs.Watch A Walk to Remember instead. Although not the best movie ever, it's a heck of alot better than this drivel.

Well, after having chosen brilliant roles such as in Ruby in Paradise and Double Jeopardy she slowely started to join the ranks of Julia Roberts and Meg Ryans as very very mediocre actresses playing right into the hands of very mediocre audiences of their films (read people who very likely will respond to toilet humor and a very unimaginative scripts).Was she in a sudden need to earn 4 million? (perhaps a new rancho was needed?).  As quickly as her weight went down (remember her somewhat chubby years back?), Judd's career went down the tubes as well. I have no more hope for her as an actress, she proved herself to me as just mediocre in both choosing her roles (Someone like you being an example) and the quality of her acting. Just like IQ, that quality can change as well.For how bad the movie really is, please read other reviews.

She is so cute, and a really fine comedic actor. Especially when she does her cheer in her underwear. She even sneaks her real mom in as a make-up person during the penultimate scene, in the studio. Jane can't seem to keep a man. Ray (Greg Kinnear) is charming, but has zero commitment, easily going from one woman to another. Eddie makes no bones about his indifference to picking up cute young women and having one-night stands, even after he and Jane begin to share an apartment.Jane develops this theory about men being like bulls, never wanting to have a relationship after they service a female.  Seeing her sister, ugly and pregnant, and her husband treating her so well, makes her realize eventually that her theory is wrong.  Where the film totally falls off its rails, for me, was the last scene when Jane and Eddie look into each others' eyes, on the snowy streets of NYC, embrace and appear to be head over heels in love.  Come on, this is so facile that it prevents the film ultimately from having any impact at all.  Maybe it wasn't meant to be.Anyway, it is a fairly enjoyable 93 minutes, watching Judd, Jackman, Kinnear, Tomei, Barkin do their things. A very lightweight romantic comedy, and like a mild bourbon will leave no lasting impression by tomorrow morning.The DVD is fine if unspectacular. The Dolby 5.1 sound is OK but very little for the rear channels or the subwoofer. There are a few extras, and the alternate ending is mildly interesting.

Likely to be a guy gagging chick pleaser, the film does everything by the book but is uninspired, lacking in creativity, and muddles in the middle with too much neophilliac bovine nonsense and the see-saw stuff with Kinnear, etc. Entertaining and fun but, like most Judd flicks, misses the mark.

A formulatic romantic comedy with bad acting and the usual plot twists that can be seen miles before they arrive. Another romantic comedy with a climax that is not only completely unbelievable, but entirely forseeable from the opening credits...*yawn* Tired old formula plot runs by the numbers. Main actress (Judd - the victim and heroine) falls in love predictably with wrong sleazebag guy, but ends up loving 2nd guy, who had seemed absolutely wrong at first...*yawn*The only highlight is Ashley Judd, who is just so damn cute and likeable, you can't help but smile when she in on screen. The first half of the movie manages to be at least somewhat interesting, but the last half drags like a non-medicated root canal.FINAL RATING 4/10 - Strictly for hardcore romantic comedy fans only!  Ashley Judd is a wonderful screen presence but not nearly enough to save this completely boring film.

According to the new cow theory, once a bull mates with a cow, it will move on to greener pastures and never look back.  To disprove the theory, they tried altering the cow's look and even its scent, but the bull is wise to the disguise and won't re-mate with an old cow.Our protagonist, Jane Goodall (?), a booking agent for a top Oprah Winfrey-like TV talk show, has similar romantic difficulties with the opposite sex.   On-and-off again in her pursuit of Mr. Right, a handsome, seemingly well-intentioned prospect and co-worker suddenly gets cold feet just when they are about to cohabitate.  Losing her apartment, she is forced to move in with another co-worker, whose bed-hopping habits certainly coincide with her new cow theory.  She wonders if there are any males out there in the dating world who don't hand out the bull anymore.The stars are all terrifically engaging in their roles.  Ashley Judd, taking a breather from all those crime thrillers, is a real natural in this lighter film venue, displaying wonderful camera presence.  Making her scenes count when they need to, her reactive takes are not only bitingly funny but quite often warm and touching.  All this makes her Cinderella alternately amusing and poignant.  Clean-cut, handsome Greg Kinnear by this time has a patent on the Ivy League bull, but still manages way to keep his hollow charmer interesting.  Hugh Jackman plays the streetwise bull with typical macho flair.  Hirsutely handsome, though not quite as hirsute as his Wolverine character in the movie X-Men, he shows definite star power in every frame.  Marisa Tomei is the perfect sardonic confidante who makes the very most of her gritty been there, done that  barbs.  And if you blink, you'll miss Ashley's mom, country superstar Naomi Judd, in a less-than-tiny bit.  Adding a nice, innovative twist to the standard fairy tale story, things fortunately don't wrap up too neatly, but shows definite hope.  The happily ever after bells don't resound as loudly, which gives it a bit more realism.  In fact, there's a telling scene at a New Year's Eve bash when our disconsolate Cinderella leaves the wild party at the stroke of midnight and breaks the heal of her slipper outside the steps of the front door.  One of our Prince Charmings comes trekking out after her, doesn't find her, sits down on the very same steps, and NEVER SEES the broken heel.Despite the surprisingly negative critical reviews on this one, this is a goody.  The herd of critics were way off base this time.  Someone Like You is the most enchanting romantic fluff I've seen in quite awhile since When Harry Met Sally...  Do yourself a favor and give this moo-vie a look-see.

If you don't like Ashley then chances are you will not like this film.  I will have to see it again to be 100% sure, but I believe that Ashley Judd is in every single scene, which is fine with me.Greg Kinnear continues to shine in this film genre and Hugh Jackman gives a very good performance, but Ellen Barkin has noticeably aged and is a long way downhill from her outstanding 1989 performance in the exceptionally good Sea of Love.Worth a diversionary trip to the movies - no blood and guts here, and if there is profanity it blew by me.

With a script based on Animal Husbandry, SOMEONE LIKE YOU is limp all right, and the brilliant Ashley Judd with energetic Marisa Tomei, and director Tony Goldwyn could not reverse the situation. Hugh Jackman with his X-men 2000 vibes couldn't help either. The movie is flat in spite of its stars. If you like Ashley Judd and don't care much about substance, then you'll probably have your fill of seeing Judd in most of the frames.The best film to date for Ashley Judd, I still think, is her first film Ruby In Paradise 1993, written and directed by Victor Nunez. Her role was substantial and truly gave her the opportunity to demonstrate her acting ability and range. What a difference a good script makes! To appreciate Marisa Tomei's energy, other than her Oscar winning movie My Cousin Vinny 1992 opposite Joe Pesci, try The Perez Family 1994 opposite Alfred Molina; at a less fiery but poetic tempo in Untamed Heart 1993 opposite Christian Slater; keeping up the romantic comedy pace opposite Robert Downey, Jr. in Only You 1994.Greg Kinnear was good in his debut starring role in Sabrina 1995 opposite Harrison Ford and Julia Ormond; also able to expand his acting range in As Good As It Gets 1997 opposite Jack Nicholson and Helen Hunt.I attended a preview of Bridget Jones's Diary 2001 and thoroughly enjoyed Renee Zellweger, Hugh Grant and Colin Firth the trio performances. The script, based on Helen Fielding's novel, has more depth and colors to the story and characters. It was terrifically humorous, too.

She figures this on when a guy from her TV office breaks up with her (possibly because he was already in a serious relationship) and then moves in with a slick womanizer (Hugh Jackman, who you might remember as Wolverine in X Men) who changes her thinking.  Often cute enough as a date movie, but the thoughts and premises Judd's character delivers are ludicrous and as insulting to guys as it might be to women (though I doubt that).  Also, TV shows aren't really done like how they are depicted in the movie (I've seen better in my TV class in High School).  Likeable and not likeable at the same time.

Judd and Jackman are both sexy and funny, and we're treated to a sequence when they're both in nothing but underwear (so we can admire their buff bodies).

Ashley Judd is sufficiently neurotic and funny, as well as beautiful.  Greg Kinnear is smoothly and self-righteously charming.  And Hugh Grant is yummily all testosterone and bad. With that said, this movie is also based on a novel called Animal Husbandry.  The movie follows the novel fairly well; however, the end is disappointingly different.  Hollywood took over.  The ending is more real (more like the average woman's experience) in the novel and you can appreciate the message better.  This movie wraps everything up in a nice little package and, as a fan of the novel, I feel betrayed.  My recommendation is that if you are thinking about reading the book, see the movie first.  You won't be disappointed.  If you've already read the book, brace yourself for the ending.

The storyline was thin, and the kiss at the end was a MAJOR disappointment - neither actor looked like they WANTED to kiss the other - it was just lips pressed together awkwardly - ruining what was supposed to be the culmination of chemistry building throughout the movie.  The only redeeming scene was with the actress playing the sister - very sweet scene, but again a storyline without development.  This movie was shallow, slow, and felt much longer than its one and half hours.  The book was better, but not much.  Each could have been really cute - but each lacked punch. Ashley's attempts to be cute fell flat - she does much better as the hard, intellectual aggressors that we've come to know and love.
