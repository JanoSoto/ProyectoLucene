[{"Title":"Who Is The Real Monster?","Date":"11 May 2001","Score":"94 out of 103 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama, Horror","Review":"  F.W. Murnau's Nosferatu has always been one of my favorite horror movies, mainly because it's one of the few that really seems to take itself seriously.  Often, even the best horror films, classics like Psycho and The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, include moments of leavening humor.  Even The Exorcist had Father Karras' film discussions with Detective Kinderman. Not Nosferatu.  This is a film that spends every moment of its running time shuddering along with the audience in fright and disgust at its beastly vampire and the plague he visits upon the innocent people of Bremen.  E. Elias Merhige's intensely imaginative Shadow of the Vampire offers an intriguing explanation of the film's creepy hold.It's 1921, and Murnau (John Malkovich), a kinky martinet obsessed with creating films as authentic as breathing, drags his crew to a moldering castle in Czechoslovakia for the filming of his vampire epic.  There, the surprised crew meets Max Schreck (Willem Dafoe), the actor playing the vampire, who, to say the least, has taken method to a new height.  He is, in fact, a real vampire, who has made a bargain with Murnau.  He will appear in the film, giving the director the realistic horror experience he so desires, if he is permitted to drink the blood of the leading lady in the final scene.  Murnau grows increasingly obsessed with feeding his muse while Schreck settles for feeding himself, the body count mounting inexorably as Murnau struggles to finish his masterpiece while his leading man is finishing off the crew.Steven Katz' script could likely have gotten by on its strikingly original premise alone, but fortunately, he turned what could have just been a corking black comedy into a surprisingly deep meditation on the dark power of the movies and the sacrifices one is willing to make, of oneself and others, in order to create art.  Schreck is seen as a dessicated shambles, the ultimate embodiment of an actor past his sell-by date still clinging to his past glory, who, in a remarkable scene, talks about the sadness of reading Dracula and seeing how thoroughly his special hell has been misinterpreted and popularized.  Of Of course, all the crew can say to this is, What an actor.  To them, Schreck is just another old hambone who can no longer distinguish fantasy from reality.In one of the film's most poignant sequences, Schreck, who earlier expressed his yearning to once again see the light of the sun, watches film footage of a sunrise through a projector, staring right into the lens so the celluloid sunlight can wash over his face.  It's a beautiful visualization of the powerful hold movies exert; everyone can remember memorable experiences that we've had through the motion picture camera, things we've done and places we've been to that we could not have gotten to any other way.  Just because these experiences were only on film does not make them any less real to us.Murnau, meanwhile, begins to emerge as the film's true monster, willing to do whatever it takes to see his vision fulfilled, sacrificing his crew, his cast, and his own humanity in the name of achieving immortality through art. Directors are often compared to God, and Shadow of the Vampire is one of the most effective variations on that theme that I have come across. Murnau, you see, is one of the old gods, and like those archaic deities, he demands blood.Merhige helms this material marvelously, conveying a sense of menace and impending doom that make this a genuine horror film in addition to a clever meditation on the form.  The film, for its low budget, has the feel of a true epic, with its castle looming up over the black hills, mossy brown-and-green cinematography, and heavy, ominous music.  The supporting cast does a uniformly fine job, particularly Udo Kier, who invests Nosferatu's producer, Albin Grau, with unspoken secrets that exist only behind his haunting eyes.This film, however, is really a showcase for Malkovich and Dafoe, who deliver two knockout performances.  Malkovich is the perfect control-freak director, calm and cajoling one moment, barking angry orders the next. He's even willing to shout down a bloodsucking beast if it will get him what he wants for his film.  Dafoe, buried under a ton of makeup, projects a real character through his fangs and hissing, making Schreck pitiable, powerful, and frightening all at once.  Dafoe received a much deserved Oscar nomination for his work here, and if Malkovich had been nominated as well, you would have heard no complaints from me.Shadow of the Vampire gets a bit muddled in its final act, when Murnau finally confronts the vampire with his most powerful weapon.  However, the final moments are so powerful, the last shot so chilling when you consider its implications, that the script's imperfections are subordinated by the power of the film's message.  Shadow of the Vampire is a provocative picture that explores the depths to which creative people will sink, the cost in lives and their own soul they are willing to pay, just for a taste of immortality.  One must beware.  The taste is a lasting one.  And sometimes bitter.

It is at once a black comedy, a horror movie with a unique setting, and a biting sendup of the art and business of moviemaking.  And the fact is that it wears each of these hats quite well, although not necessarily at the same time.The movie asks us to imagine  What if Max Schreck, the mysterious guy who gave what is still considered one of the best vampire performances ever, did so well because, well, he really was a vampire?  The skulking creature, we are to imagine, was finagled into performing in Nosferatu for legendary cinema pioneer F.W. Murnau.  The story then follows as the crew makes the movie dealing with all sorts of difficulties, not the least of which is the star's habit of snacking on cameramen.Among the film's many virtues is its portrayal of filmmaking in what was really its dawn as a form of art and commerce.  People like me, who have trouble with silent movies may gain an additional appreciation for the work and craft that went in to them, and realize that while they may seem hokey and stylized to us now, they had a beauty and substance that was all their own, and still is.John Malkovich turns in a great performance as the visionary Murnau (who, while tortured, must be a genius because he always gets it in one take). It is a characteristic Malkovich role, a rationalist given to bouts of fury, and it is as much fun to see him discourse pretentiously on the science and art of the moving image as it is to see him pitch a fit (Albon, a NATIVE has wandered into my FRAME!).The core of this movie, however, and deservedly so, is Willem Dafoe's unforgettable portrayal of Schreck.  This is not your slick-talking Anne-Rice undead-Vogue kinda vampire.  Schreck is the next thing up from a rat, squatting in filth and clicking his claws, and Dafoe is able to inspire laughter as well as fear, and even pathos.  He makes us imagine what a rotten existence it must be, to have eternal life alone in a rotting ruin and a withered body.  He and Malkovich have some great scenes together, including a sick, hilarious moment when Schreck and Murnau try to hammer out who on the crew may or may not be snacked upon (the cinematographer is necessary, it seems, but the script girl is negotiable).The movie functions best as a sendup of moviemaking, as the harried Murnau must deal with temperamental actors, unfriendly locals, blood-sucking undead, and other hazards of the movie trade.  At one point, Murnau must leave to calm the investors, a scene I really wish had been included. Some of the best moments are those of the age-old creature of the night attempting to take direction and find his motivation.  Everyone is afraid of Schreck, but admire the dedication that keeps him in character all the time (he's a Method actor, explains Murnau, he studied with Stanislavsky). The movie makes its point rather neatly, that filmmakers, and by extension filmmaking itself, have a way of sucking the life and blood out of you. Anyone who has ever had to shoot a movie on location will attest to this.If I have a complaint about the movie, it is only that after its extreme cleverness, it settles for a somewhat straightforward horror-style denouement.  Myself, I would have thought the vampire would end up moving to Berlin and getting an agent, a swimming pool, and a meeting with Ovitz. Still, the movie clearly makes its point an auteur driven by a mania for artistic perfection can be more of a monster than something that just lives in a cave and drinks blood from your neck.

Well, the result is both slightly scary and pretty funny. Director E. Elias Merhige and writer Steven Katz create a fairly creepy mood, and inhabit the picture with some real interesting characters.John Malkovich plays famous silent film director F.W. Murnau. This is perhaps the funniest performance of the bunch, especially when he is giving audible instructions to the actors while the camera is rolling. Then, there is Willem Dafoe who plays Max Schreck/ the vampire. It is incredibly fun to watch an almost unrecognizable Dafoe play this oddball, Max Schreck. Unfortunately for Murnau, Schreck starts doing what vampires tend to do... bite people. The original photographer dies along with a few others at the mouth of Schreck. After seeing this movie, it is quite easy to see why Dafoe was nominated for best supporting actor at the Oscars. His performance is worth the price of admission.This is a film which is hard to classify, sense it is a fictional account of an actual film with real people. Yet this horror-comedy does have its moments of wonderful macabre humor along with great performances to help make it an enjoyable movie. A 7 out of 10. I highly recommend watching this as part of a double feature. First, watch Murnau's original 1922 masterpiece, Nosferatu, then watch Shadow of a Vampire. You will appreciate Shadow of a Vampire a lot more (or maybe vice versa).

At the time (as now) it was the definitive expression of the timeless story of Count Dracula. There have been, of course, endless renditions of the 1896 Bram Stoker tale; however, Nosferatu was unique in that the medium of cinema was extremely new in 1924, and the maker had to deal with prejudices against this newfangled form of entertainment, which had to compete with the written word. Now, of course, a new Dracula film need not compete with the original story; it only needs to compete with earlier versions on film.   This movie explains the story of how Nosferatu was produced. The director, F. W. Murnau (John Malkovich), is filming his masterpiece in Germany (the widow of the story's author refused to sign the rights to the story, so they couldn't film in Transylvania or use any of the names in the book). His choice to play the part of the vampire Nosferatu is Max Schreck (Willem Dafoe), a beastly, hideous man who will appear to the cast and crew only in character (an early example of Method acting, to be sure). Shreck will not travel or bunk with the company; he will live only in the cave dwelling that the film's protagonist, Count Orlac, calls his home.   With a leading man that eccentric, it's no wonder trouble appears on the set. People get sick, others appear listless and not quite into their work. Still, the tenacious Murnau pushes on. He must get his shot! His film must be completed! And as it progresses, he slips a little further into his own world, and Schrek - who, it has been said, played perhaps the ugliest vampire in film history - assumes more and more control over the direction of the movie (although not literally).    Dafoe is unrecognizable in makeup, but the sinister creepiness he brings to most of his roles is evident here. It's an accomplished actor who can play a part in full makeup and still make the role distinguishable from... well, from some chump in a lot of makeup. Dafoe's excellent here, and his interplay with Malkovich is galvanizing. Their scenes together are like an actor's class on How To Emote and Project. There are times when each actor appears to ham it up slightly (or, in the case of Malkovich, more than slightly), but the two of them together constitute a casting coup.   This is a wonderful little film, yet another that didn't quite get the acclaim it deserved. The atmosphere is both rich and compelling, both essential qualities for a film that's all about vampires from long ago. This is not a movie that's high on special effects, either; don't expect to see a lot of flash and fancy. It's also a homage to silent movies and to old-time horror films in general. It's a minimalist film in terms of set itself, but much is done with so little.

It feels good to see that it's still possible to create movies like this. Even though the plot is rather simple, the movie seems to be very original and innovating. The basic idea behind this movie is so simple that it is - in fact - brilliant and it makes me wonder why nobody has thought about this earlier. The movie is completely based on the very early horror milestone Nosferatu, ein symphony des grauens. Legendary actor Max Schrek is portrayed here like a REAL vampire who regularly takes a bite out of his crew. Director F.W. Murnau knows about this but finishing his movie is a higher priority to him than to sacrifice a few people.This theme makes it of course a must for the ancient horror fans. Lots of footage and trivia of the 1922 masterpiece are shown and that's a real extra value for true cinema buffs ! But of course, this movie reaches far above average thanks to the brilliant performances. A totally disguised Willem Dafoe is absolutely amazing in his role of Max Shreck. It's like looking at the real Schrek...the resemblance is terrific. His appearance (especially the long nails) give you the creeps whenever he's on screen and his voice haunts your head every time he says something. Dafoe never gives away a bad performance but this one is extraordinary. And of course,the same can be said about John Malkovich...his portrayal of director F.W. Murnau is extremely realistic and believable. He plays Murnau as the man who slowly goes insane because he tries to be too perfect. An amazing performance !!There aren't many shock effects to detect in this movie but that's rather normal, right ? After all, it's more like a costume-drama than it is horror. The lack of exiting scenes is made up by the constant presence of tension and an extremely appropriate atmosphere. Also, a perfect image of Eastern Europe in the 1920's is presented to the audience. All these aspects make a much better movie then just some ordinary slashing and slicing throats. A must see !!

This movie was disturbing in how it captured the true evil of the legendary vampire and the unsettledness of a set that has been portrayed by a perfectionist. A movie that captures such evil and psychosis possesses the true, dark, nightmarish atmosphere that even the best of horror films lack.Willem Dafoe has given his best in this film. His dark aura that gave life to another villain he would later play -- the Green Goblin -- was perfect for the part of a deranged vampire who yearns from loneliness and hatred of his decomposing body. A being who is haunted by the loss of his past. Of his inability to make others like him, and be lonely no more. And yet, he is also a being that is always one step ahead of his demise, and manages to evade death and prevent his victims from escape with the same cunningness that would give him the part of one of the most evil of comic-book villains.Though I've seen little of Malkovich, I thought that he played perfectly the part of the perfectionist. A perfectionist that is possessed by the desire of the perfect film that captures great evil and makes it's audience actually experience the feeling of a great dark presence. A film that 'doesn't make people say 'You should have been there', but that 'We have been there.' A director whose desire of perfection puts the lives of even his most loyal of crew in the path of Death itself. A Death that has desires nowhere near as dark as the being that called upon it.Such a film is nightmarish and heart-throbbing just by Shrek stepping from the hallow hallway and into the moonlight to welcome his 'guest'.Overall perfection...Rating 9 out of 10. A truly disturbing film with atmosphere that remains dark, even during the day...

Shadow of the Vampire explores this unusual concept as it follows the story of the filming of the 1921 silent film classic. Malkovich plays the role of Murnau, the German director who makes the bargain from hell to provide realism to his Dracula knock-off, only to find that he has unleashed a monster. This is a horror film that is really a psychological drama -- the true horror lies in the man who decides no price is too high for the making of his movie. At the same time, there's a lot of humor, as well as an intriguing glimpse of Berlin in the decadent 1920s.Dafoe is definitely an Oscar nominee with this performance (and the film should get an Oscar for his make-up, too) especially powerful scenes include his describing his reaction to reading the novel Dracula, by Bram Stoker; and a confrontation with Murnau near the end of the film, when Murnau finally is forced to recognize what he has done. Strong acting performances from the supporting actors as well -- Elwes' accent wanders, as does Malkovich's, but the cast (including native Germans) is generally strong. Some really nice cinematography and editing.It adds to the experience to have seen the silent film first, by the way; it is well worth viewing in any case. It's available in a remastered print with a good soundtrack. Shadow takes a few liberties with the original film, but not important ones (those night scenes were obviously not shot at night, for example).I loved this film -- two thumbs up!

W. Murnau's silent classic vampire film Nosferatu. Shadow of the Vampire does not pretend to be a documentary; it is a highly stylized, fictional work that delves into its very own imaginative speculations about a filmmaker's creative process.Having assembled his crew, Murnau (John Malkovich) travels to a small town in Czechoslovakia, where he intends to recreate before his camera the story of Bram Stoker's Dracula. Set on creating the most realistic vampire film, Murnau secretly recruits a real vampire (Willem Dafoe), promising to recompense the creature with leading lady Greta (Catherine McCormack). Murnau cautiously introduces the vampire to his producer Albin Grau (Udo Kier) and scriptwriter Henrick Galeen (John Gillet) as Max Schreck, a truly professional method actor trained by Stanislavsky. Schreck performs his scenes suspiciously well, only appearing on the set at night and in character, keeping his end of the bargain with the director. Soon, however, his blood thirst takes over and he fearlessly threatens to eliminate, one by one, Murnau's most dispensable crew members.Shadow of the Vampire stems from the premise that its protagonist, the fictional Murnau (Malkovich), must hire a real vampire in order to ensure a truly authentic representation of the vampire character, Count Orlock, for his film Nosferatu. The viewer who seeks a more accurate portrayal of the making of the real Nosferatu may find this premise strained and far-fetched, and may even consider the film's ensuing humor a bit aimless. However, Shadow of the Vampire integrates the humorous premise to its metaphorical exploration of the artistic process and of the inevitable struggle between the star, the director and the crew. (In one scene, Schreck tries to secure his interests --a new victim-- by negotiating with Murnau. He reflects I don't think we need the writer any longer.) Aside from the film's complex treatment of the film within the film and of the character within the character (where Shadow of the Vampire re-presents Nosferatu, and Shadow's cast plays Nosferatu's cast), the film's most enjoyable aspect is its careful reconstruction of specific Nosferatu scenes. When demonstrating how Murnau shoots these well-known scenes, Shadow's own shots shift between black & white and color; from a full-frame to one enclosed by an iris. Shadow's recreation of the classic scenes are often accompanied by Murnau's off-screen voice-over instructions to the actors, who in turn stop in mid-shot, enter, or exit the frame. These choices offer a fantastic depiction of silent film technique, and they as well add new life and a sort of magical dimension to the original Nosferatu scenes. Undoubtedly, Shadow of the Vampire may be most fully appreciated by the viewer that has already developed a sensitive appreciation for Nosferatu's unforgettable images. Still, Shadow of the Vampire may be enjoyed as well by those fascinated by filmmaking or --as Shadow's Murnau put it-- by the science of the creation of memory.

There are a number of scenes from this movie that draw on Nosferatu, and it makes a lot of the scenes more enjoyable. The movie is done in very much an expressionist vein it itself, the kind of film F.W. Murnau would certainly have appreciated.The concept here is incredibly intriguing - what if a horror movie was a horror to film? Once the film kicks into gear, it establishes a rather creepy mood, especially in the sets, most of which mirror those of Nosferatu (the writer's bed, for instance, looks exactly like Hutter's).As the film progresses, the actors take over the film, and it's interesting to see how they stack up to their precursors from 70 years ago. Eddie Izzard is an interesting Hutter (the Jonathan Harker analog), as (pretend) silent acting is well-tailored to his overbearing antics. Udo Kier is quite good as reserved producer Albin Grau. Alas, Cary Elwes, one of Hollywood's most underappreciated actors, is typecast as a kind of roguish, free-spirited Fritz Wagner, a real cinematographer (and the main one throughout all of Nosferatu) and one of the stalwarts of German cinema into the 50's.Malkovich is ideal for this role. He does a good job of being a manic, desparate for everything on his film to go right. His Murnau is a control-freak, a guy who keeps his crew in the dark, and adds to the generally creepiness.The most curious thing about Murnau's Nosferatu is the vampire himself. The rest of the characters are pretty direct analogs of Dracula. But instead of a suave, cool vampire of the Christopher Lee/Gary Oldman mold (later roles, of course), Murnau's vampire was a stiff, cold, violent monster. Willem Dafoe is absolutely brilliant in portraying this. He has some moments of comedic relief, bickering harmlessly with Malkovich, and generally being a fish out of water. Soon, however, his character becomes undeniably creepy, and Dafoe does a great job of making Count Orlok seem like the kind of guy who makes your skin crawl. In some way, this Orlok is less of a monster - he's portrayed a bit more sympathetically, sorrowing in his loneliness and never getting to see light. Murnau's vampire was almost always shot from below, making him appear huge and menacing; Dafoe's Orlok isn't monstrous so much as he just makes your skin crawl.I do have a couple beefs, though, mainly technical. On a purely nitpicky level, Murnau is mentioned as a comtemporary of Griffith and Eisenstein, despite the fact that Eisenstein didn't make a movie until two years after Nosferatu. On a less petty level, the characters seem a bit dumb. They have no problem accepting the fact that Orlok is an actual vampire once Malkovich tells them, but can't seem to figure it out on their own, despite seeing, among other things, Orlok pulling a bat out of the air and sucking the blood out of it.The film, in general, does not end well. The penultimate scene is horribly contrived, a lot of silly reminiscing to to advance the plot a little. The ending itself isn't necessarily bad, just a bit ambigous. You don't come away with a clear sense of who (if anyone) was wronged amongst the main characters, and we leave a couple of them in limbo. A couple of technical details are odd, too. Murnau's Nosferatu has a shadow and a reflection, but this one only a shadow. Also, in the final scene they are supposedly filming, there's a wooden stake that's nowhere to be found in Nosferatu.A quick note, by the way - while the movie they are filming actually exists, rest assured the story is pure fantasy. Max Schreck went on to make more movies, as did the rest of the actors in this film, and no actors were bitten during the filming of the original movie.A thououghly enjoyable film, especially if you're familiar with the subject matter.

The industry loves this stuff. So do actors when they get to play a character that acts. So do I. This time we have a very clever twist in how this is conceived, some interesting acting and a quirky director.First the conception. Actors love playing actors, because that way they can play a few characters at once. Sometimes this occurs when the character isn't actually an actor but is acting nonetheless, as in con stories. Sometimes the actor adds the levels of himself and showing how he acts. But here we have a real twist We have Defoe, playing a character which is pretending to be an actor but is actually the character that the actor is acting. What a marvelous idea! It must have swept through Hollywood.I have no doubt that many actors rushed to get in on the idea. Superficially, the most quirky involvement is Cage as producer. Cage is intense in his acting, but among many attempts, we have never seen anything intelligent, just intense -- sometimes apt, mostly not. But he obviously wants to be smart. Watching him on the DVD talk about this, one can see how puffed up he is, and how clueless.Dafoe is the right man for the job in one respect, he plays one character exceedingly well. But that's not where the gold is. The real payoff would have been him playing with the multiple layers of self-reference. He does do some amusing stuff with his poses which one could see as him trying act like a movie version of himself. Clearly this is his goal, but its not leveraged, or extended to other worlds. Still, this is worth watching.Malkovich is another case altogether. He is like the fellow in the meeting who seems to do nothing, but if you take him out of the equation the meeting falls apart. Malkovich is cursed in that when he acts, you cannot see that he his acting. This is not as advantageous as it sounds to cast no shadow. Here's where he falls down. He gives lip service to the collapse of reality and imagination but doesn't actually live that collapse.The other dimension of this film is the director's vision, and this is related to Malkovich's problem. This director does both get and have the stuff to live the collapse. His  vision is strong, competent, and transports us. It successfully bridges the genuine `other' film vision and his own modern one. The former has its anchor in surrealism, the modern one in selfawareness. Merhige races ahead in his collapsing of layers and dimensions and visions, doing what Aranofski wishes he were. Malkovich is his screen avatar and should be leading the way, but doesn't. And he bungles the key trick.That trick, which modern audiences will call the `Usual Suspects/Sixth Sense' twist, actually comes well before the end. We know that Mernau is a drug addict and that Greta is too. Also that `we don't need a writer anymore.' Also that the director is no longer in charge. The trick dimension is that the Count isn't really a vampire, just an actor that the drugs of the cast (and the general aether of Berlin is a drug here) make appear so. Watch when Greta sees the Count's reflection in the mirror. Everyone in the audience WILL see that reflection because it really is there. But she is convinced she doesn't, and I'll bet you were too.

One of the biggest myths that circles around that film was the question if Max Schreck really was a vampire. He still to this day gave one of cinema's most chilling performances. Apparently he was always in make up and character, wonder what it would have been like to try to just say hi to him, right? Then on top of all that his last name in German means fright, it just doesn't get any better than that! So to take the idea that he really was a vampire and to translate on film what it took to make one of the most terrifying pictures in cinema, you have Shadow of the Vampire.In 1921, German director Frederich Murnau takes his cast and crew on-location in Slovakia and Poland in order to shoot Nosferatu. He informs them that the person playing the part of the vampire Count Orlok, an obscure German theater performer named Max Schreck, is a highly professional character actor, but in order to involve himself fully in his character, he will only appear among the cast and crew in full make-up and character. Schreck is there waiting for the filming team, and his appearance and behavior are truly disquieting. The cameraman soon starts feeling terrorized and sick, and has to be taken away and replaced. The other main actor, Gustav von Wangenheim, is frightened of Schreck, but then convinces himself that Schreck is simply a very good actor. Maybe too good considering he starts to eat the cast and crew as payment for playing the evil vampire. Guess Hollywood still hasn't come that far since then.I loved this movie, everything about it. Just like I'm sure the real Max Schreck would have received a nomination for his chilling performance, William Defoe made that up for him when he picked up the nomination. What a great performance by Defoe, one of those actors where you know he's got it in him to lose himself in the role and you're just memorized by him. His and John Malkovich's chemistry is just amazing and they play off each other so well. John pulls in a great performance as Murnau as well, so focused on the picture losing his humanity making you wonder who is the bigger monster? The make up effects were great and the whole atmosphere was just frightening. You literally feel like you're back in the time where silent films were made. Shadow of the Vampire is a terrific film and one 2000's best movies. I highly recommend it, if you're curious how a film is put together or just looking for good entertainment, the perfect mixture of dark humor and horror, Shadow of the Vampire is one not to be missed.9/10 "},{"Title":"I'm in the minority as usual!","Date":"7 October 2005","Score":"5 out of 7 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama, Horror","Review":" Of those small crowds of film fans who usually does not see what the fuss is over certain films people call great, sadly this is the case with SHADOW OF THE VAMPIRE, a film I had wanted to see for so long & tried so desperately to like, but instead found myself board with what was occurring on screen, the film is a fictional account of what many have happened during the filming of the 1922 silent horror film NOSFERATU, when a film maker hires a real vampire to star in his movie, only to have him attack the other actors.

I still giggle at the genius of the its premise, that the mysterious star of the 1922 vampire classic Nosferatu, Max Schreck, was a real vampire! True, after his debut, Schreck went on to make many more films. But Shadow offers a tasty 'what if' scenario that's irresistible. F.W. Murnau, the obsessive director of Nosferatu doesn't feel he can make a realistic enough vampire movie with an actor in the title role. While traveling through Transylvania Murnau meets Count Orlock, an actual bloodsucker and makes a deal with him to star in his new film. Because the director has cast a genuine monster as his lead, his cast and crew start to disappear until finally...well, not exactly. Orlock isn't the kind of vampire we've come to imagine because of Hollywood, but a simple recluse living alone in a castle. That's the coup that director E. Elias Mehridge and writer Stephen Katz pull. There is no attempt to make this a horror film. It's as scary as the old black-and-white silent horror films are to us in our computer effects-driven era of movies. Most of the time these films are good for a laugh from a modern audience. But the directors of those old films were always after something dark, deep, and meaningful. The screams they produced were simply a side effect.The problems that Murnau encounters arise out of Schreck's very real vampire needs. For starters, he's cast a man who is not an actor. Shadow is not a comedy, but it's funny seeing Murnau's idea of a vampire clash with Schreck's. Schreck can't possibly act like a vampire. He IS one. The first scenes they use him in (he'll only appear at night of course) are disastrous. He doesn't follow direction, doesn't follow the script, and just acts weird. Willem Dafoe, under tons of make-up, perfectly portrays a guy who obviously doesn't get out very much. Eventually the cast and crew change their opinion of Schreck from believing he's awful to seeing him as a very committed method actor (the producer and writer witness him catch a bat in mid-flight and eat it). Mehridge goes out of his way to bring the audience something completely original and succeeds. Even though shadow is based on the making of another film, every image, every word of dialogue seems painstakingly crafted to give you something you've never seen before. Mehridge is definitely one to watch.Grade A        "},{"Title":"Shadow of the Vampire is one that sticks with you.","Date":"23 March 2015","Score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama, Horror","Review":" First off, I want to praise the writer, Steven Katz, for this idea.

Elias Merhige's 2000 film Shadow of the Vampire is a very strange and interesting film. I walked into this film thinking it was a 'making of' film, like My Week With Marilyn or Hitchcock, except this time it was the making of the 1922 silent horror classic Nosferatu. It looks and feels like that kind of film at first, but it is not. There are real people being portrayed. John Malkovich plays a drug addicted F.W. Murnau and Willem Dafoe brilliantly plays the method actor Max Schreck. I'm not sure if Murnau was a drug addict or if Schreck was obsessed with embodying Count Orlock, but I don't think this film really cares about the facts. It doesn't really have to since it is a movie. The story is about the making of Nosferatu, but instead of concerning itself with what happened, Merhige focuses on the filmmaking process and why filmmakers do what they do, whether it is the director, actor, cinematographer, and so on. Shadow of the Vampire makes us look at what silent filmmakers had to do in order to make a movie and how much passion can be put into a project. Sometimes that passion can become just as horrific as the movie itself.Because of this focus on the filmmaking process, character development kind of gets left behind. Sometimes things don't feel like they have context. The movie is more about ideas of filmmaking than telling a true account of what happened on the set of Nosferatu. I don't know exactly why they added the dug addiction part, because it takes away from the main theme of the movie and it isn't really explained. Maybe you can interpret the film in different ways because of it. I guess it's the audience's decision. Shadow of the Vampire seems to be one thing at first and then turns into something else by the end. It's a film that probably deserves a second viewing in order to be fully appreciated. There are great performances and it gives an interesting look at the filmmaking process and why filmmakers do what they do.

There is a great mystery surrounding the story that was originally inspired by Bram Stokers Dracula, but couldn't use the name Dracula because of legal issues. There is a whole different story hidden there, but the movie does not care about legal rights, it cares about rumors that had to do with the actor portraying Nosferatu.To say more would be spoiling things about the movie.

A fictionalised account of the making of F.W. Murnau's 1922 silent horror classic, Shadow of the Vampire toys with the notion that Nosferatu's star Max Schreck (played here by Dafoe) was actually a bona fide member of the undead.This fanciful idea plays out a little too slowly, perhaps, but offers plenty of opportunity for dark humour, the cast delivering suitably offbeat performances that prove strangely intoxicating, with Dafoe's mesmerising turn as Shreck being the film's strongest suit, the actor's mannerisms and expressions played to perfection.Casual movie fans who haven't seen Murnau's classic will probably wonder what the hell is going on, so I recommend seeing Nosferatu beforehand, just so that one can fully appreciate the magic of certain scenes and the brilliance of Dafoe's performance.

Max Schreck's performance as the title vampire in F.W Murnau's Vampire masterpiece Nosferatu is so uncanny, so life like we loose our grasp on reality and believe. Nosferatu is a rarity among horror movies, it get's better with age and it's still fresh and scary after multiple viewings. This is largely thanks to Schreck. He's become more legend than man due to Nosferatu and Shadow of the Vampire preys on that.FW Murnau is filming his vampire film as the movie begins. His cast and crew are left in the dark about the film's key ingredient, the Count. Murnau displeases his financiers when he moves production to Czechoslovakia to accommodate his star. The setting of the old inn creates perfect mood as it's real life inhabitants believe in vampires. Murnau introduces Schreck as the ultimate method actor, a man so engulfed in his character he will only appear in full make-up and as the vampire. Murnau is the ultimate realist and he plans to make a masterpiece even if he has to sacrifice a few necks to do so...Shadow of the Vampire is a modern Vampire masterpiece. The vampire genre had been dry since Oldman portrayed the Count. Shadow of the Vampire understands that a lot of people aren't scared by vampires any more and that type of movie goer is who they market this film to.One of Shadow's strongest points is it's sense of humor. Schreck's rant about how he didn't like Dracula because he had no servants is hilarious in a very dry way. Lines like Sit back and let the vampire do the work bring a smile to my face. Shadow pokes fun at the genre but also respects it.I really loved how Murnau is portrayed here. All though he is over dramatic for fictitious sake, the realist emotional storytelling methods were very ingrained in the German expressionist movement. There's a great scene in the movie where after seeing his cinematographer on the brink of death, Murnau suggests that maybe it isn't all bad because after all it scared the cast and crew.Shadows' strongest asset is it's vampire. Willem Dafoe is picture perfect in the title role. Dafoe matches Shreck in every single way. There are scenes from Nosferatu within the film where I wondered if it was the real Schreck or Dafoe. The outstanding make-up mixed with Dafoe's performance create the most realistic vampire ever.

It isn't a horror film, nor is it a thriller. It is a drama film in the strictest sense of the term. It is not a light movie, it's not entertaining in the more common meaning of the word, and I must warn the very faint-hearted to abstain although the US R rating seems a bit excessive. However, if you like powerful dramas, it will be love at first sight.The film is, to borrow the previous reviewer's expression, is a fictionalized account of making the 1922 silent horror film, Nosferatu. As such, it takes us through the shooting of this film by brilliant but megalomaniac director, dokter F.W.Murnau (John Malkovich), surrounded by his capricious actors and impatient financiers. His star is the eccentric and secretive actor Max Schreck (Willem Dafoe), who immerses himself into the character of Nosferatu. The drama is heightened by the fact that Nosferatu is shot in a remote village of Central Europe.Minor spoiler ahead, revealed early in the filmThe twist to this story is that Schreck is a vampire, and is hired as such by Murnau who promesses him to deliver actress Greta Schroder (Catherine McCormack). What ensues is a riveting struggle between Schreck and Murnau.I have rated this film 10, because in its parameters (which, we have established is not horror, but drama), it is absolutely perfect.The first thing you pick-up from the film is a strange look on 1920's film-making crew in lab coats and goggles, director yelling descriptions to the actors, and of course, the black and white universe in which we are plunged whenever there are parts of Nosferatu being shot. Also, we take a peak into the decadent lifestyles of the various actorsBeyond this, the main feature of the film is the relationship between Schreck and Murnau. Here, the characters are beautifully written, developed on-screen and performed. On the one hand, Screck, the aging vampire, trapped in his immortality, stripped of his former glory, and reduced to perform as a curiosity for Murnau in exchange for nourishment. The character seems to be quite similar to that of Nosferatu.It is beautifully rendered by the rubber-faced Willem Dafoe, who restores the pathetic as well as the horrific qualities of his character. On the other side is Director F.W.Murnau, the brilliant director with an enormous ego and hidden weaknesses. Murnau sees himself first and foremost as a scientist, documenting the vampire and telling his story using a new and revolutionary medium, the motion picture. Here too, John Malkovich's performance is flawless, rendering all the complexities of the character. The clash between the two is what drives the film and provides its climactic ending.Along with those are the extravagant actors and the superstitious villagers, whose role is to bring the central duel into perspective. Last, but not least is, what is in my opinion, brilliant cinematography. It starts with the many black and white shots portraying what is actually being filmed by Murnau and conveying a brilliant dramatic sense to it. Second is the dark interior shots omnipresent in the film which also induce the intensity of the presentation. Third are the zoom shots on the protagonists' faces and even the camera equipment which is amazingly effective.All and all, the film is a very tense dramatic and visual experience which should only be appreciated when you are up for it.

Watch Dafoe use his face for maximum potential in every scene as well as his body.  Dafoe's interpretation(and the make-up) is brilliant.  Dafoe creates some eerie scenes with his acting.  The other acting in the film is good.  John Malkovich makes a good autocratic Murnau.  Catherine McCormack is quite good a a German starlet(pretty to boot as well), and Udo Kier is very good as the producer.  Carry Elwes is basically scenery.  The biggest problem with the film is the script.  The first part of the film introduces the characters and shows Murnau making his classic almost shot by shot.  The way Malkovich talks his actors through each scene as he directs probably is very realistic as sound was not used.  I especially liked how black and white film was used once we see things from the perspective of the camera lens.  This first half is almost like a documentary on the making of Nosferatu. But about midway into the picture, the character of Dafoe is something more than an actor.  He is something more than Max Schreck.  This turn of events really was a let-down for me.  First of all, Max Schreck did quite a few movies.   This film basically dismisses him as a one-time actor. The film, in my humble opinion, takes far too many liberties with the distortion of reality.  I will admit that this line of exposition is interesting, but it is also very constricting to the development of plot and characterization.  Once we find out what Screck wants, the film becomes almost transparent.  The ending is easily the most disappointing.  Yet, despite the wanting script, the film is hauntingly shot with some very effective scenes and some incredible insights into movie-making from a bygone era and in a different place other than Hollywood.  It is nice to see pictures like this made.  To fully enjoy the film, I heartily recommend watching the 1924 classic FIRST.  It will make the film much more meaningful and interesting to you.

The acting is good as well.  John Malkovich never ceases to please and Willem Dafoe makes an amazing transformation (with an outstanding makeup job) into the blood-sucking star of the F.W. Murnau classic Nosferatu.  His performance is quite good, though I expected him to get more screen time.  Since the Oscars are long gone, I'm not sure if he got nominated for Best Actor or Best Supporting Actor.  Though his performance is poignant and very impressive, and you can barely recognize Dafoe--not only through the copious makeup, but also through the accent and mannerisms, I can't measure it up to an Oscar-worthy level.  The premise is original and quite fun to play with.  This is a fictional account, and it's interesting how the screenwriter conjured up the idea--after indulging the brutal realism of the classic vampire flick--of making the star, Max Shrek, an actual vampire.  This spawns some darkly comic moments, like the scene where the bloodthirsty ghoul murders the cameraman and Malkovich as Murnau screams out, Why did you have to murder the cameraman!!!  Why couldn't you murder the....script girl!!!  Shrek replies, Oh...I'll eat her later.  The whole film has that amusing mixture of horror and black comedy, reminiscent of Tim Burton's style of filmmaking.  The German accents are a little cheesy, but it's not a film meant to be taken with utter seriousness.  It's also nice how the director plays around with the idea of Murnau's unstoppable ambition, as he would picture it.  The kind of ambition that would coax him to do--literally--whatever it takes to complete this work of art, even if numerous people have to get killed in the process.  The ending perfectly demonstrates this raw ambition.  So it brings out a good sense of irony.  By the time the film is over, you start to realize that the real monster is not Shrek; it's Murnau.  But he's a monster with a dream.  A monster with a mission.  I'm sure there are few--if any--directors in history who've shared the exact thirst for the art form as Murnau in Shadow of the Vampire.  I don't know any directors who'd sacrifice their cast and crew for a movie.  Correct me if I'm wrong.  But it's meant to be an exaggerated account of how far a director would go.  And this exaggeration is the best way to express the idea.I love the musical score.  Along with the vivid art direction, the score helps accentuate the creepy mood to the point where it almost invades your subconscious.  I was, however, surprised by the running time.  I didn't anticipate a 90-minute film.  Yes, it's pretty snappy, and though I'm not sure how it would've been better if it were longer, I was still left with an Is that all? feeling.  Shadow of the Vampire is a smart, original, funny, entertaining, haunting piece.  It's well done, though I can't say it's a film that will stick in my mind for years to come.  For some reason, I just felt that it could've lived up to more.  Maybe they could've played around with the character of Shrek more frequently.  It was missing a tiny bit of something that I can't quite point out.  But I'm not going to lose sleep over it.  It's a good movie and definitely worth renting.

Shadow brims with wit and class; a black comedy set in a behind-the-scenes look at the filming of Murnau's 1922 silent vampire film, Nosferatu, eine Symphonie des Grauens (Nosferatu, a Symphony of Horror).The film centres on the unusual relationship between Nosferatu's fanatical director F.W. Murnau (Malkovich) and it's lead actor Max Schreck (Dafoe), who plays the part of Count Orlok or Nosferatu, but who soon seems like he is taking his Stanislavski method acting a little too seriously!  Some of the crew become suspicious of Schreck in light of his dedication to realism, but when people start disappearing there is no doubt that a real vampire is in their midst.  Murnau continues despite and with Nazi diligence attempts to finish his vampire epic, whilst Merhige follows, brutalising the story with gothic imagery and posing supernatural questions over the mystery and fact that shrouded the making of this plagiarism of Bram Stoker's Dracula.The acting is superb, with an incredible performance from Dafoe, which is gaining him nominations and awards across the world, not to be shadowed however by Malkovich's passionate, raw emotion portrayal of the obsessive, ambitious director.  The film looks fantastic as well, blending black and white imagery in the frame of the silent movie to the brilliant colours of the set around them, with all the ease and beauty we'd expect from great directors of both eras.

Elias Mehrige's Shadow of the Vampire is a funny, beautiful, and scary yarn about the strange events that take place on the set of Nosferatu, the first film that actually involved a vampire.John Malkovich portrays the German silent film director F.W. Murnau, who (was a legend in his own time) desperately wants to make the best vampire movie.  Originally, Murnau wanted to make a movie entitled Dracula based on the novel by Bram Stroker, but his widow refuses to let Murnau use the rights.  So Murnau changes a few things.First, he changes the film's title from Dracula to Nosferatu and the name of the vampire character from Count Dracula to Count Orlok.Second, Murnau hires Max Schreck (Willem Dafoe), a mysterious, eerie, and very unknown actor to play Orlok and Murnau tells his actors and the film crew that Schreck is the ultimate method actor.  Plus, Schreck can only be referred to as Count Orlok.  In my view, Schreck seems to be raw and lacking experience, but everyone on the set is surprised when they see Schreck for the first time.Dafoe is great here as Schreck and is nearly unrecognizable with the heavy layer of make-up that he has.  And in one scene when Murnau is about to start filming and sees that Schreck has applied onto his face.  Murnau demands that Schreck has no makeup and later on, he tells Schreck  You will have no close-ups.  None!Director Mehrige and writer Steven Katz make a very interesting and fascinating point that Schreck was a vampire, basically an aging one.  The point became very clear to me when some of the film crew begin to fall ill.Also, the movie has a real gloomy and gothic look and Lou Bogue, the cinematographer makes it appear very real.The film has a fairly reliable supporting cast to back Dafoe and Malkovich, who are both great here even though Dafoe is the standout and might have a good shot of earning a Best Supporting Oscar.  Cary Elwes appears as the photographer Fritz Wagner, who isn't bitten by Schreck, Catherine McCormack as Greta Schroder, who is fussy leading lady, Eddie Izzard as Gustav, who is another actor, Aden Gillet as Henrick Galeen, the film's writer, and Udo Kier as the producer Albin Grau.

The pace and bulk of the interesting parts of Shadow arrive before and during the crew's filming at Count Olock's castle.  Once the crew leaves that area, and once Murnau himself exits, the film loses a lot of its dramatic tension.  To echo another writer, I was astounded at two scenes of Dafoe 1.The monologue that he has in interpreting the sadness of Dracula (evoking the awe of the producer and writer) and 2.a nearly marginal scene in which Schreck discovers a projector in his castle that has been left behind by the crew.  He hunches over it and begins to turn the crank, and on his old stone wall, a hillside appears in bright white light!  In utter curiosity, the vampire puts his hand before the lens and sees his finger stretch magically across the frame.  Nosferatu learns cinema!  The music and the look on Dafoe's face made this moment really magical.         There is a definite uneasiness in the film about tone.  Is this supposed to be a campy comedy or a melodrama?  The only person I care about by the end is the vampire.  The other characters, especially the producer,  photographer, and actress, are all vain idiots, and I couldn't have cared less about their deaths.  The only tension is when Schreck threatens (SPOILER) to kill Murnau after the final shot has been performed.         Both actors do a marvelous job.  Murnau A NATIVE HAS WANDERED INTO MY FRAME!!

I can do no more.The movie was totally devoid of horror, suspense, intelligent scripting, decent direction or even comedy. The lighting was also very dull, which I suppose fits the tone of this movie as I shall demonstrate.The plot, if you can call it that, revolves around F.W. Murnau shooting the movie, NOSFERATU, and finding out that his lead actor, Max Shreck, is a real vampire. At least the plot idea seems unique enough. So, two characters are based on real people and they are involved in the production of a real movie, NOSFERATU, but the production is fictionalised. If you hear a noise you are probably hearing Murnau and Shreck spinning in their graves.At the time of writing this comment, the movie has a rating of 6.8 out of 10. Why? This movie was boring beyond even the wildest parts of my imagination. I can't really give away spoilers as there's nothing to spoil. This excuse for a movie contained a series of only loosely-connected scenes seemingly created and placed randomly. They show director F.W. Murnau, directing the production of his well-known legend, NOSFERATU. Nothing of interest happened at all! Every single scene was lifeless. The movie was as flat as a pancake. SHADOW OF A VAMPIRE bored me so much that I could only handle the first half of it. I decided to switch off at the halfway point, one of the few rare occasions in my life that I felt compelled to turn a movie off. I have no regrets because I don't think I missed anything exciting.John Malkovich plays F.W. Murnau. He was in most of the scenes I saw. He delivers all his lines in a very boring one-note style that makes most things bland appear to shine like bright beacons. From Malkovich's portrayal, one would think that Murnau was a control freak unable to motivate those he directed and who had no real passion in his work at all. This is a complete insult to the memory of a famous director of a now very popular movie. Malkovich has done better work and I've seen one example that I really loved. So, what's he doing here?The same could be said about Willem Dafoe, who played Max Shreck. What's he doing here? Admittedly, he made a better attempt than Malkovich to try and save the movie, but his efforts were wasted. He would have been better off staying at home. Even his short screen time in MR. BEAN'S HOLIDAY was a far better achievement than his work in this movie.I noticed Cary Elwes in the opening credits and on the cast list on IMDb. Where was he? I don't remember seeing him. He must have been keeping a very low profile. I have to say I don't blame him.Then there's Eddie Izzard. What's he doing here? He was very popular on British TV screens at the time this movie was made. Maybe he was casted to fool British audiences into the idea that this movie is a spoof documentary about the making of NOSFERATU. But there's nothing funny to find here.The only remotely pleasing aspect of this movie was the design of the opening credits. However, at 5 minutes or so in length, even they go on for too long.After noticing the high rating for this movie, I felt compelled to express my view. I bought the DVD of this movie for £1 at the local pound shop and still feel like I've allowed myself to be cheated. I would feel very guilty about selling my copy so I'll probably just put it in the garbage heap where it well and truly belongs.To summarise, I do not recommend this movie at all. If you want to learn something about Murnau or Shreck, see the real NOSFERATU instead of this fictionalised piece of junk. Or alternatively, do some research on the Internet. Trust me when I say that either investment would be a far better use of your time.

If you've seen Herzog's NOSFERATU THE VAMPYRE, you know it is mostly a pallid affair. Now, unfortunately, with E. Elias Merhige's SHADOW OF THE VAMPIRE, we get more of the same. This time we are treated to a kind of docudrama purporting to show us how, perhaps, NOSFERATU came into being. Yet we gain no insight into Murnau's life or his artistic accomplishments leading up to NOSFERATU. SHADOW opens hurriedly, showing Murnau and company enroute to a foreign shooting location. With perfunctory exposition the film attempts to establish Murnau's reputation as a controlling artistic force, but there is very little of dramatic import here. Similarly, the mystery of Max Shreck- who he was, where he came from, what drew Murnau to him, et cetera, is never dealt with in cinematic terms. Merhige tries to offset the emptiness of the script by suggesting that Shreck was an actual vampire, promised his pick of the film crew by Murnau just to get the movie completed. But this idea has very limited success. On the other hand, Willem Dafoe's Shreck/Orlock is another in a series of arresting takes on the actor and the character. Less demonic than Shreck, not as guilt-ridden as Kinski's version, Dafoe is like a cranky old veteran, impatient with the endless preamble of life. He just wants his meal(!) and his solitude. He's creepy, to be sure, and rather pathetic. John Malkovich as Murnau chews through the scenery like a petulant brat. The strange opening title sequence of the film is its most interesting asset a mysterious line drawing of an entranceway, highly baroque in design, unfolding and changing as you are drawn closer, into an hypnotic and sinister multiplicity of shapes, figures, and patterns.

It's shameful that so much talent went into the making of a film that sounded so unique and had so much promise, but turned out to be an utter wreck.  It seems to me that none of the people involved had any love for Murnau's art or for silent film in general.  In fact, I think the film was made with the same contempt as Fractured Flickers or others of that ilk.  All of the actors, but especially Dafoe, hammed up the silent film acting so that everyone in the audience laughed.  Malkovich, as Murnau, cranks the film at different speeds according to his whim, and he and his cameraman are never cranking at even remotely the same speed.  He directs his actors by saying Now go here, now do this, now do that... as though silent film directors merely talked their actors through their paces.  All of this is ridiculous as Malkovich is touted as a genius and lectures on and on about film as art.  What we see on the screen is silent film as a joke, which makes all this talk of genius into a laugh.If you are a fan of silent film, or if you are someone who would like to learn more about Murnau, do yourself a favor--rent Noseferatu or Sunrise and watch genius from the source.

I've never been a John Malcovitch fan, either, and this movie is one of the many reasons why he's supposed to be a German director, yet he loses his accent so often that it's all but non-existent- and the constant theatrical turns as a great director are a pain to watch.

What made the experience even richer was then to proceed to Murnau's film, the Herzog one from the seventies and then, rather obviously, this one. Not only a film about a film in the general sense, Merhige's Shadow of the Vampire (2000) is the most cunning remake ever made. It enriches the original in retrospect so thoroughly that Murnau's film is far better for it. Since when has art been so generous? If you love self-referential stories as much as I do, I'd imagine you'd have a field day with this film. It's a killer.One amazing thing is that this film not only equals and enriches the original that was made at a time when the genre didn't have such baggage as it has today, it also still succeeds in doing it in modern terms, which for reasons unbeknownst to me lives on in coded references to older tropes, mostly commenting them ironically.I think they manage to do that because filmmaking is a serious art, and the obsession of the vampire is easy to equate with the obsession of the filmmaker. Both are in it for the blood. Another reason is because they've made Schreck the self-reflexive, enigmatic center of the film, where Dafoe who's playing him can use the ironic references to build up a dialogue between him and the viewers &#x97; is he an actor playing an actor playing an actor or what? Isn't that exactly what the crew are wondering?Ted Goranson, in his review Shadows, Reflections (see the comments section), sees this as an extended hallucination. I agree wholeheartedly. In the end we have Murnau out of his wits thanks to the opium but in the next scene he directs as before, fervently and obsessively, everything ending in a sequence that's as intense as nothing else. Schreck is not a vampire, since we see his reflection in the mirror (Greta thinks there's no reflection) but he's made one by the imaginative power of the filmmaker.While I like Murnau's 1922 film, I adore Herzog's Nosferatu Phantom der Nacht (1979). As said, Merhige's film succeeds in making both films richer, and better for it. Haunting, haunted.

This 80 minute movie is lifted from its ordinariness by stunning performance by Malkovich as Munrau and Defoe as Shreck.

He is setting the frame for the story of the making of Nosferatu. Like any good frame, it establishes the context of the story without intruding into it.Today, we are so accustomed to change that it is impossible for us to appreciate the magnitude of change that motion pictures represented. These days, we expect the events and devices around us to be in flux; any software or device that hasn't updated within two years is considered hopelessly out of date and unable to catch up.At the advent of motion pictures, for who could see, this was the most fundamental change humanity had ever achieved. Man could now create new realities and capture and alter time itself. Those who recognized this change were driven by irresistible passions.Asking whether or not Max Schrek really was a vampire provides some comic situations and exchanges, and produces tensions that move the movie along. But was he really a vampire or not? That isn't the question Shadow of the Vampire answers. The answered question is Would Friedrich Murnau have brought a real vampire into the picture if he'd had the opportunity?And the answer is an undeniably passionate YES! This passion is so strong that, in a scene where Muranu has lost control of Schrek, he is able to regain it by ordering him back to his position with the declaration If it isn't in the frame, it doesn't exist. Somewhat like a vampire, the movie Nosferatu has lived beyond the lifetime of those involved with it. The court that found Nosferatu to be in violation of copyright ordered all copies be destroyed. But they are among us today.Motion pictures and vampires are a natural fit, near twins in their existence. They are created outside the normal forces of nature. They have a compelling appeal for us, and an existence that stretches beyond a person's lifetime. Neither is truly real, truly alive, but with a good movie like this, that doesn't seem to matter.

But the ace director gets more reality than he bargains for after hiring for the role of the vampire Count Orlak not the method acting Stanislovski lunatic seen by others to be so totally immersed in his character, but a genuine, bloodsucking child of the night who can't keep his teeth off the cast and crew.Students of pre-Vitaphone melodrama will remember Murnau's silent masterpiece as the earliest and arguably best adaptation of Bram Stoker's 'Dracula', but this sometimes amusing, sometimes startling behind-the-scenes speculation (was Max Schreck such a memorable vampire because he wasn't acting?) is more than just a one-joke novelty for literate film buffs. The original screenplay by Steven Katz shows unusual sympathy for the monster, who like any amateur actor with a weakness for stardom reveals a temperamental interest in make-up and stage lighting, the latter in particular a poignant reminder of the daylight he can never again experience. And director Elias Merhige is able to achieve (on a modest budget, without any typically visceral creature-feature clichés) a nice sense of (sometimes comic) dread by the film's climactic scenes, when Murnau begins to seriously contemplate sacrificing his leading lady to the vampire's bloodlust just to get a convincing scene.John Malkovich portrays the German director with his trademark languid detachment and a mere hint of a Middle-European accent. But the film clearly belongs to Willem Dafoe, so persuasive in the title role that viewers might begin to suspect he too might be an actual vampire only pretending to be a Hollywood actor, here playing a fellow bloodsucker who (wheels within wheels) is likewise only pretending to be an actor portraying a vampire.

Turns out it's not a horror movie, in fact I'm not even sure what genre of film it is, but one thing for sure is that it's twisted and suspenseful. Shadow of the Vampire is based on the premise that Max Schrek, who played Count Orlock in real-life movie Nosferatu, actually WAS a vampire. Shadow of the Vampie is sort of a fictional documentary related to horror I guess.Max is one of the most genuine characters you'll ever come across. He's strange and mysterious and almost comedic. His character is very believable - when you see him on the screen you'll feel his pain and loneliness and be intrigued by him, despite the fact that he's a bloodsucking vampire and doesn't look like he smells too pleasant.The rest of the characters are also genuine, in particular the director.. you truly believe how obsessed and out of touch with reality this man gets with making the movie. The acting in this movie was phenomenal. There wasn't a single part where the cynic in me went yeah right, which admittedly happens in a lot of movies. The plot is suspenseful and goes along smoothly, nothing too ridiculous even though the whole premise itself is pretty unlikely. The plot is fairly easy to grasp but intriguing. A lot of the lines are simple but will have you thinking (especially Max's - he is a rather insightful creature).The quality of the movie itself is also phenomenal. This was definitely not a low budget movie, nor was it too over the top with effects and whatnot. I like some of the effects like when the filming INSIDE the movie starts, the camera turns into a black-and-white, no sound picture like the original movie. The rest of the scenery is generally dark and romantic and makes a perfect background for the story (rather than being a modern-day version). The nd is predicable but it's suspenseful all the same. This movie is well made, nothing trite about it, a few funny bits, one of those movies I would recommend to anyone regardless of taste in movies.

Begotten director Edmund Elias Merhige's second film qualifies as an artsy fartsy account about the making of groundbreaking German filmmaker F.W. Murnau's silent chiller Nosferatu back in 1921. No sooner had Nosferatu been released to theaters than Florence Stoker sued Murnau and company for copyright infringement. She won the case, and the court ordered the destruction of all film prints and negatives. Happily, some bootleg copies escaped annihilation, and the Murnau's artistic legacy as well as the film's contribution to vampire films survived Florence's wrath. Not only did Nosferatu emerge as Murnau's greatest film, but it also exerted a considerable influence on vampire films. The greatest enemy of a vampire in Nosferatu was sunlight. Although Stoker's Dracula could cavort during the day, Murnau and company changed it so the sunlight proved to be the vampire's greatest enemy. Merhige helmed his first film, a silent opus entitled Begotten, about 10 years before he embarked on this witty but wry epic that appropriates an urban legend about the actor who incarnated Count Orlock. The first forty-five minutes are flawless. Unfortunately, complications occur in the denouement, and cynicism undercuts what could have been a masterpiece of self-parody. Basically, the uneven Shadow of a Vampire concludes with an unhappy ending while it celebrates the monster that the film conjured up. An important question that you may find yourself asking is who is the real monster in Shadow of the Vampire? Is it the vampire Count Orlock? Or is the real monster none other than Murnau himself? Essentially, Murnau abhorred working within the confines of his Berlin studio. Restless, he decided to take advantage of lensing on-location in both Czechoslovakia and Poland despite the protests of his producer Albin Grau (Udo Kier of Andy Warhol's Dracula) about the mounting costs.The clever premise of Shadow of a Vampire is that Murnau makes a Faustian deal with a genuine vampire to act in his film on the condition that he gets to drain film's leading lady. Ironically, Katz received the 2000 Bram Stoker Award as Best Screenwriter for Shadow of the Vampire for his script. Remember, this is a film about the very film that Florence Stoker sought to destroy entirely because the filmmakers had plagiarized it. There are really only two important characters in Mehrige's film. The mercurial John Malkovich inhabits the role of the eccentric Teutonic helmer who attained greater fame and fortune in Hollywood before an automobile crash claimed his life in 1931. Malkovich commands your attention throughout the story. Although he cannot stand to work within the controlled conditions of a studio, Murnau takes the film company on location because this is the only way that he can employ Court Orlock as an actor. As a film director, Murnau behaves like a tyrant. Meanwhile, Willem Dafoe of Platoon impersonates one of the world's most mysterious and repugnant looking real-life actors, Max Schreck. Little is known about Schreck and the role challenged Dafoe who settled on using the film as a means to guide his creation of Schreck. According to Dafoe, The most important research tool was the footage. The only thing I could find out about Max was that a biographer of Murnau said he was 'an actor of no distinction.' But the script was very strong, and we had the actual Nosferatu film as a kind of touchstone and base. So much had to wait until I got into the prosthetic (the makeup). I didn't just have extreme makeup, but also a costume that was restricting. The shoes made me walk a particular way. The padding in the clothes also made me walk a particular way. It was great because it's a huge mask which frees you up so much. Ultimately, Dafoe received an Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actor for his portrayal of Schreck. He spent three hours getting into make-up for the role and he wore platform shoes. Dafoe was so persuasive as Orlock that the producers of Spider-man 2 hired him on the basis of his performance as Max Schreck. Indeed, Shadow of a Vampire went on to win several cinematic awards.Watching Shadow of a Vampire as a companion piece to Nosferatu will furnish viewers with some insights not only into the silent original but also the nature of the working conditions in the early film industry. Mehrige supplies a commentary track with the DVD release that reveals certain things that occurred during the production of silent films that will enlighten moviegoers. Nevertheless, the actual Max Schreck was not a vampire and worked in 33 other films after he made Nosferatu. Indeed, Schreck had played in four films before he played the world's most infamous vampire.Indeed, Shadow of the Vampire doesn't qualify as an objective casework about either Nosferatu or Murnau. Ostensibly, Merhige's neat conceit of for picture suffers for being shallow and uneven with forgettable cardboard characters. Admirably, Mehrige and scenarist Steve Katz never stoop to lowest common denominator stunts in this somewhat amusing, sometimes pretentious, but rarely scary, 93-minute escapade. Merhige plays everything rather straight-up until Count Orlock kills his first victim. Orlock differs from most vampires because he doesn't create other vampires. He kills and his victims die. Mind you, Dafoe's acting as well as Malkovich's performance, Lou Bogue's atmospheric photography, and the real-life settings distinguish what really constitutes a one-note 'what if' gimmick film. Nevertheless, Merhige's concise direction, Dafoe's engrossing performance as the vampire coupled with Malkovich's monomaniac behavior make Shadow of the Vampire worth watching despite its obvious shortcomings. While he admires Murnau's films, Mehrige presents the master filmmaker in an unsympathetic light as a cold-blooded man who treats everybody collectively as pawns.

I've heard this movie, which stars Max Schreck in the Dracula role, is the greatest vampire film of all time. But first I found Shadow of the Vampire, a fictional history of the making of Nosferatu- in which Max Schreck is a real vampire, pretending to be a human pretending to be a vampire.This would have been more fun if it were possible to think it were true, if nothing was known about the real Max Schreck except that he appeared in Nosferatu and disappeared shortly after (in this movie, Schreck is exposed to sunlight and dies at the end of the filming). But Schreck was a real actor who appeared in other productions and lived into the 1930s. Pictures of him without vampire makeup exist. Nevertheless, Shadow of the Vampire is a unique idea. It feels like a fun idea unless you consider it an insult to the real Schreck, to be portrayed as a bloodthirsty murderer. But maybe it was in a way complimentary, to say his performance was so good that you just might think he was a real vampire. Schreck himself is played well by Willem Dafoe, who got an Oscar nomination for this role.In Shadow of the Vampire, the only one among the Nosferatu cast and crew who knows Schreck is a vampire is the director Murnau (John Malkovich), who evidently thinks making a movie is worth the risk in working with an undead killer. He does get upset when Schreck begins killing some of the cast and crew, but only because that creates difficulty for the picture. As you might expect from a man who's not a real actor, Schreck has some difficulties at first, like when he looks at the camera, but generally his performance inspires awe in his co-workers. One may wonder why Schreck is doing this- does he have much use for money? He couldn't be making the movie for immortality- he already has that. The movie eventually reveals he's doing it because Murnau plans to sacrifice one of his actresses to him- although why he couldn't be feeding off other women without making the movie is a bit unclear. Still, Shadow of the Vampire is entertaining, and who knows, maybe one day someone will make a movie in which Willem Dafoe is a real vampire.Happy Halloween.

The tongue-in-cheek humour within this ambitiously well-mounted story are smartly inspired, with sly and witty little jabs, and the vivid performances of John Malkovich and William Dafoe are nothing more than outstanding.

From the lighting, to the frame positioning, grand score and the magnificent art direction. Everything comes together, and takes shape. But it's the random things that are happening behind the scenes, that makes this novelty a real treat. However a real bonus is the whole just who is the real monster theme, which very well explored and this due to the committed chemistry between the two leads. They look different, but share the same determination to get what they want from this project, by any possible means. The wry gags about Shreck's take on the Mary Shelley's Dracula, and his supposed method acting skills were a complete blast.It's like a fresh outlook and it might come off being stagy, but its stays true to the style and feel of its inspiration. Still there are moody atmospheric chills, but also making its way in is a strangely kinky side that a colourfully eccentric Malkovich seems to embrace. Dafoe's oddball, dramatically compassionate transformation, and twitchy expressive traits simply had me transfixed and under all that professionally catered make-up he's totally unrecognisable as Shreck.

If the courts in Germany had done their jobs correctly we would know nothing of the silent gem Nosferatu, today. Stoker's widow sued over plagiarism of her husband's work by Murnau and won. But it does survive, and this film tells, in a fanciful way of the filming of that classic film with its different vampire look from that of Hollywood. The actor (real name unknown) called Max Shreck (German for Terror) created a truly horrifying Vampire, liked so much by some that the film Nosferatu was remade by Werner Herzog in the 1970's and the character of Barlow in Salem's Lot used a similar look. It is the darker concept of this film that makes it so compelling, when the reclusive actor Shreck will only film his scenes at night. And he terrifies the actress on the set of the film. It is also a tribute to the painful efforts to shoot on location in those early days of film.(This was set in 1922) Malkovitch and Dafoe are sterling in this grand dark drama.

The concept of making a movie about Murnau and Nosferatu as a vampire movie is a great idea to begin with. The premise of the film - what if Max Shreck, the mysterious actor who played Count Orlock in the classic vampire film, really was a vampire? - is also a great concept, especially since so little was really known about him. The idea is great, but very difficult to handle, as the film proves; the ideas have not been fully developed, and there are huge gaps in the plot. Except for the characters and the scenes from the original movie, Shadow Of The Vampire has little to do with historical facts and the whole thing doesn't make much sense.But who cares? It's still incredibly entertaining, scary at times but never pointlessly gory, with a dark, ironic sense of humor which never trails into silliness. Merhige's directing is fabulous, and he seems to really feel a bond with Murnau; the photography, costumes and lighting are wonderful. Of course, the two lead actors steal the show - John Malkovich as Murnau and Willem Defoe as Shreck, both of them frightfully good in their roles. Cary Elwes, Eddie Izzard and Catherine McCormack are all good too. The acting and the direction more than make up for the somewhat flawed script. At any rate, it's certainly refreshingly better than the dozens of terrible teen-summer-horror movie that have been swarming the theaters in recent years. A very good movie, if you're a fan of the genre. "},{"Title":"Excellent","Date":"20 April 2005","Score":"","Genre":"Drama, Horror","Review":" I can't say i'm a fan of the horror classics myself. Usually those movies just don't seem to touch me. I guess it might just be the fact that they are made in a time quite far removed from the time i live in, and of course the things we find frightening might be equally changed during all those decades.This is of course not a classic horror movie, rather a movie ABOUT a classic horror movie. Namely F.W. Murnaus Nosferatu and the making of said film. This movie focuses on the persistent rumor that Murnau had actually found a genuine vampire to star in his film. Here portrayed in an excellent way by Willem Dafoe.This movie has many things that make it excellent. First of all Willem Dafoe who i have long found to be an excellent actor, and this is perhaps the performance of his life. The rest of the cast are also very good without reaching the levels of Dafoe. Also the attention to detail struck me in this movie. There are just so many small details to see and appreciate, an attention to detail that i found very rewarding.Like most movies though this one is not without it's drawbacks. What i have seen many people complain about is the five-minute starting credits that are almost unbearably slow. When i watched the movie in the theater i remember almost dozing off, which is not a good way to start a movie. The second part is the German accents. I can't help but feel that too many times when John Malkovich is involved movies turn into a presentation of laughable accents. It's a small factor here though, the actors are good enough for me to overlook the accents, but it's unnecessary.All in all i loved this movie. Well acted, well produced, very funny at times and with Willem Dafoes excellent performance as the stand-out feature. I realize this might not be for everyone, but to those with an interest in this kind of film it's a very rewarding experience.I rate it 8/10.

Max Schreck reflects the unconscious desire of the socially disengaged male (vampire), who is useless in society (daylight), and can only plunge the fangs (penis) into an unwilling person. Schreck's attack scenes, and those of Dracula in other films, are stylized rape scenarios.Continuing the dualism between Vampire and Man (in this case Murnau), it was interesting to note that when Murnau was faced with an uncooperative female, he used a pointed instrument (a hypodermic needle) to placate Greta, in the same fashion as a vampire who renders a resisting victim unconscious with his fangs.More generally, I absolutely adore this film. Every time I watch it, the eye is drawn to a new and interesting detail in the frame, previously unnoticed. Great performances by all actors, a haunting background score, and a script to top them all makes this film a 10/10.

Neither, thankfully, is it another shocking or gratuitous horror flick.  The plot is highly original - it is set within the efforts of a real 1922 Berlin film-making company, on location in Germany and central Europe, to produce an authentic vampire film. John Malkovich plays the self-possessed director Murnau, who alone understands that his leading vampire Max Shrek (Willem Dafoe) is, indeed, a real aristocratic vampire with an equally real need of human blood.  Shrek has been promised the neck of the drug-taking leading lady (Catherine McCormack) as payment for bringing his 'role authenticity' to Murnau.Shadow Of the vampire hauntingly recreates several of the actual scenes from F.W. Murnau's original silent classic 'Nosferatu', using these to eerily create unease and tension in an atmospheric way, very reminicent of Klaus Kinski's role in 'Nosferatu The Vampyre' (1979).  The viewer is chilled, not scared, whilst being caught up in the decadence and desire of the 1920s germanic film-making industry.  Shadow Of The Vampire cleverly imbues the original silent film 'Nosferatu' with its own hidden agenda - an agenda of bloodlust and vampire authenticism.However, Murnau's plans are not infallible, as Max Shrek's real bloodlust is difficult for Murnau to contain, in order that his film is finished with all his actors and actresses' necks in one piece.  The leading actor, Gustav, is played, interestingly, by Eddie Izzard, who adds a faintly humorous touch to procedings as Gustav is caught up in events which he cannot understand.An infinitely watchable offering, Shadow Of The Vampire works best as a a deliciously malevolent study of one man's desire to capture perfection on 1920s film, no matter what the consequences.  Possibly the study's only flaw is the lack of a superior musical score (such as that heard throughout 'Nosferatu The Vampyre') that saturates the scenes and endowes the viewer with a far richer memory of what is, in point, a clever film script, supported by worthy performances by the evergreen Malkovich and underrated Dafoe.

This Shadow will definitely come out from the very short shadow cast by such target-market  idiocy like Dracula2000. Although, to be fair, that movie didn't have the great cast this one does Willem Defoe gives the performance of his career in this movie.  As the title character, he is both amusing and horrifying at the same time, and the resemblance to the classic Nosferatu is uncanny.  Admittedly, they had a good headstart, Defoe's features being already somewhat cadaverous and ratlike, but the makeup job is notheless very well done, totally consistent in every closeup (and boy, were there a lot of those).   John Malkovich, as corrupt genius director F.W. Murnau, is excellent, trading on his skill at portraying an even blend of malevolence and hysteria.  His character is the only one that garners any real sympathy; the victims in this film are almost as larger- than-life and unreal as the celluloid they slave over.  Udo Kier as the producer, Eddie Izzard as vainglorious actor Gustav Froehlich and Cary Elwes as daredevil cameraman Fritz Wagner all turn in great performances and memorable one liners.  The cinematography convincingly conveys the feel of being in a 1920's silent film, and the emulation of the classic film is dead-on.   There is, of course, more than a bit of blood flowing, and an overall air of the supernatural, but these are used with wonderful restraint.  It's very nice to once again see a vampire film with no need for huge fangs or computer-generated macabre.  Shadow won't breath any new life into the vampire film genre - it obviously isn't meant to - but it does teach an old dog (or legend) a few new tricks.

Lovers of film will get a particular kick out of this production since it uses as its kernel of historic truth the making of F.W. Murnau's 1922 silent horror classic `Nosferatu,' a film that predated the American version of `Dracula' by almost a decade.   Writer Steven Katz and director E. Elias Merhige have envisioned the famed actor Max Schreck (who portrayed the original vampire in Murnau's film) as an ACTUAL vampire, hired by Murnau to achieve the highest degree of realism possible.  However, as Murnau soon discovers, it isn't always easy to keep a real vampire down on the set &#150; and, as a number of his crew members start to fall victim to this ultimate in `method actors,' the completion of the film itself becomes ever more doubtful.Walking a fine line between muted suspense and dark comedy, the film makes certain that we never quite forget the parallels that exist between the vampire, who yearns to make a victim of the beautiful starlet assigned to play the lead female role, and the director, who will sacrifice his own cast and crew to achieve his artistic ends.  The film provides a fascinating duel of wills as both vampire and director confront one another with threats, recriminations and broken promises, only vaguely aware that they are really playing at the same game.  As Schreck, Willem DaFoe brings a strange sensitivity to the man behind the makeup.  We actually feel for this creature who has obviously fallen from the pinnacle of wealth and fine living in his `previous' life into this nocturnal pit where his only companions are bats and rats he is forced to devour for his own survival.  One of the most poignant moments in the film comes when Schreck, alone on a deserted set, watches in mournful fascination a clip of film showing nothing more amazing or profound than a simple summer sunrise. John Malkovich gives his usual superb performance as Murnau, a man who becomes so absorbed in bringing his own make believe world to artistic fulfillment that he eventually cannot distinguish between what is real and what is illusory, eventually calling on his film crew to complete the final scene, totally unaware that they all lie dead at his feet, victims of his own obsessive madness.  That sense of disorientation is summed up in a key line uttered by Murnau - as he tells his suddenly uncooperative leading man/vampire about the nature of film and, by extension, life - `If it happens outside the frame, it isn't happening.'On a technical level, `Shadow of the Vampire' is an astonishing achievement in the art of filmic recreation.  Many of the film-within-a-film scenes capture the quintessence of Murnau's original work almost to a tee.  Although DeFoe's image doesn't quite reach the grotesque level of Schreck's original, the sets and general appearance of the recreated shots often fool us into believing we are seeing the real thing.  Also, the filmmakers capture well the atmosphere of decadence that defined much of the artistic community in that postwar German era.`Shadow of the Vampire' is a highly unique and innovative creation.  In a way, it honors the endurance of the original `Nosferatu' in showing that you really cannot keep a good vampire &#150; or a good vampire movie - buried forever.

Sometimes he's the brilliant actor in such movies as The Ogre and In The Line of Fire.  And other times he's the miscast weirdo in such films as Man in the Iron Mask and Mulholland Falls.  So, i'm not really sure what to make of him usually.  He is, certainly a unique actor, and that's exactly what Shadow of the Vampire calls for.  He's a sort of Dr. Frankenstein for the infant film industry of the 1920's.  He plays the character of the director of the dark story of Dracula.  AS the director, he's just sane enough to have gotten financial backing and production support to produce the film, but bordering on the insanity of tracking down a real vampire to play the Dracula (aka Nosferatu--since the rights hadn't been allowed to film Dracula) part.  John Malkovich is both calm and professional, while there are sudden bursts of his insane fanaticism with vampires and realising his demonic vision of the ultimate horror film.  John Malkovich needs to find his niche, but once he does he is brilliant.  Congratulations to Nicolas Cage for casting Malkovich so perfectly.Willem Dafoe on the other hand is always excellent in even minute characters such as Wild at Heart and Born on the 4th of July!  Willem Dafoe, unfortunately hasn't had the career making movies that his abilities deserve.  However, Shadow of the Vampire is certainly his most amazing effort and he enveloped himself in the role to the extent of unrecognisability.  To watch the original film of Nosferatu you'd think that Willem Dafoe had played the part originally.  His actions and movements, his mannerisms are uncanny.  Obviously, the makeup he covers himself in adds so much to the part as well, but Dafoe becomes Max Shreck the Vampire actor who has the innate desire for human blood.  He rightfully deserved all the praise and the 2000 Oscar nomination for best supporting actor (which ended up going to the equally talented Benicio del Toro for Traffic).The film is about a director's passion for film and how he is willing to risk the lives of his actors and even his own life in order to make his lifelong dream of the best and most perfect horror film.  I'm not sure how much of the film is true, as far as whether any of the actors or crew really died on/off the set, but it would be interesting to find out that they really did die.  Obviously the story is based on the filming of Nosferatu but the vampire killings are for the sake of entertainment (for lack of a better word).The only problem i have is the end of the film seemed unresolved.  The film also starts to border on the campy horror movies where everyone dies all at once.  And as in many ficitious concept stories, there's the thought that maybe it was a better concept than it was a movie (see Unbreakable).  If anything the performances of both Malkovich & Dafoe are by far their best and it is worth it just to see the slithering and depravity that Dafoe's character exudes and the creeping insanity that overtakes Malkovich's character.

The acting is very impressive with John Malkovich in a good role with a bad accent and Willem Dafoe, giving an almost legendary performance of an updated version vampire we all know too well. Direction and cinematography satisfy, although the moody blackness of the film sometimes darkens it a little too much so we have to look very hard to see what's going on. Kudos to the makeup artists for fantastic face detail with Willem Dafoe's character. The actor is unrecognisable and the makeup is brilliant. The scenes I really loved in this movie were the conversations with Malkovich and Dafoe. They are extremely powerful and the two actors have great chemistry. There is one extremely eerie scene with the two when Malkovich jumps on top of Dafoe and Dafoe's vampire smiles spookily at him, giving us and Malkovich's character the ultimate creeps. That scene will definitely send a chill down your spine. I also enjoyed the scenes when the crew was shooting Nosferatu, and Eddie Izzard's quiet large cameo. I recommend this movie mostly for people who have seen Nosferatu and really appreciate films and don't mind the odd boring bits. I'll admit sometimes I was a bit slouched from the uninteresting parts, but the film has highly entertaining and intelligent scenes it totally makes up for it.

Nonsense, was what the newspapers said and no one can deny that they are right. E.

How this idea was born and what sense it actually makes, I cannot say; I suppose the only reason to make this film was that Merhige didn't have any other ideas.But well, it's not quite constructive to be angry for 90 minutes about a stupid idea. As soon as a viewer has accepted the fact that there is a real vampire acting in the movie, &#132;Shadow of the Vampire` is a fine little piece of art (although there is no doubt that if the &#132;vampire` was in fact a fanatic Stanislawskian method actor wrapped up in his role, I would have given the movie ten points!). The pictures are beautiful though not quite gruesome; also Willem Dafoe's Orlock is not as frightening as (unintentionally?) funny &#150; it must have been great fun for him to play that role. And the dialogues present a bit of a playful irony that is made possible only by the idiotic plot. &#132;He's an actor.

It deals with the events surrounding F.W. Murnau's making of Nosferatu, a legendary silent horror film from Germany.  There have been many mysteries surrounding Max Shreck, who, in real life, did refuse to show up on the sets without his costume and makeup.  He seemed truly obsessed with his character, and it payed off, as he created quite possibly the most realistic vampire ever caught on film.This film presents the idea that, perhaps, he seemed so perfect for the role for a reason.  The idea here is that Murnau hired a real vampire, going by the name of Max Shreck (Shreck is German for fear) and acting in Murnau's picture so long as he can take the blood of the leading lady in the final scene.Shadow of the Vampire is often a darkly funny film, mostly because of Willem Dafoe's brilliant performance, playing his character as goofy and unknowledgable about film, but dangerous and frightening when he needs to be.  He delivers perhaps the best performance of 2000, making the viewer await his every screen presence and gluing our eyes to the screen with his every movement.This is not a vampire thriller, in fact, its far from it.  It is a black comedy and a drama, full of artistic and compelling ideas.

Anyone watching this film will know within the first twenty minutes more or less what will happen and how the film will end.  It doesn't matter.  `Shadow of the Vampire' is proof that sometimes the journey is far more important &#150; and enjoyable &#150; than the destination.An extremely fictional look at the making of the real silent film classic `Nosferatu', `Shadow of the Vampire' is about the quest of German film director F.W. Murnau (John Malkovich) to make a perfect horror film.  Rebuffed in his attempts to purchase the rights to Bram Stoker's `Dracula', Murnau nevertheless decides to make a horror film about the vampire `Count Orlock', one which he will film on location in the Transylvania region instead of in Germany.  Once there, Murnau explains to his production crew that his new film &#150; `Nosferatu' &#150; will star a brilliant method actor named Max Schreck (Willam Dafoe) as Count Orlock.  According to Murnau, Schreck is a consummate `method actor' &#150; in fact, the mysterious man is so immersed in his `role' as a vampire that no one will be allow to see him out of his make-up, and filming is only to take place at night.  Reluctantly, the crew (and Murnau's financial backers) agree to these unorthodox filming requirements, but as production of `Nosferatu' gets underway, members of the film crew start to either fall ill or completely vanish altogether.  Murnau realizes that in order to finish his masterpiece, he'll have to do it fast.  Otherwise, the `method actor' known as Max Schreck &#150; who is, in fact, a real vampire &#150; may feed on his entire production crew, and there may be nobody left alive to finish the film . . . Because the actual film `Nosferatu' is real (and, incidentally, outstanding), and because `Shadow of the Vampire' is faithful to `Nosferatu' to a large degree (except, well, for the part about Max Schreck being a real vampire), `Shadow of the Vampire' is by nature predictable.  There's no doubt as to whether or not the film will be completed, or whether or not other members of the cast will drive a stake through `Schreck's' heart before the film is completed.  The events of the film are known, and are predictable, so there's little suspense in guessing what will happen next.  What isn't known is HOW things will happen.  `Shadow of the Vampire' is very much a film of details.  Learning why `Schreck' agreed to be in the film, learning why Murnau is so obsessed with perfection, learning why Greta (Catherine McCormack) is specifically chosen to be the leading lady in `Nosferatu' &#150; these details, while not always crucial to the outcome of the film, are what make `Shadow of the Vampire' a very engaging, compelling story.  The performances &#150; at least the majority of them &#150; are nothing short of brilliant.  Willam Dafoe IS Max Schreck in this film.  Not for one second does he look or act like anything even remotely human.  He takes a difficult role &#150; a monster who only dimly remembers what is was once like to be human &#150; and plays it with such natural ease, it's nothing short of astonishing.  At times, Dafoe actually turns Schreck into a sad, pitiful creature, which is even more impressive considering that at other times Schreck is little more than a savage killing machine.  Dafoe is just amazing to watch in this film.   Malkovich is impressive as well as the obsessed director Murnau, who's more than willing to make deals with the devil &#150; or, in this case, with a vampire &#150; in order to realize his artistic visions.  In a way, Murnau and `Max Schreck' are uncomfortably similar characters; both are dependent creatures who have lost contact with normal human relationships.  Catherine McCormack is perfect as Greta, a stage diva who looks at film work as beneath contempt; the fate that awaits her character is perhaps gruesome . .. but after watching her interact with the other characters, it's hardly surprising.  The only character who I found slightly disappointing was Cary Elwes as the cinematographer Fritz Wagner &#150; for whatever reason, he just didn't seem to properly fit into the film.  His lines seemed forced, and he seemed completely out of sync with the rest of the cast.  Every time he appeared onscreen, he seemed so absolutely out of place that it became distracting.  Perhaps this was more an instance of every other actor sliding so effortlessly into their roles, rather than an instance of hideous miscasting . . . but I doubt it.As for the look of the film &#150; well, it evokes the dark, somber feel of a silent horror film perfectly.  Everything is either dark and littered with longing shadows, or hints in some ways at something quite disturbing.  There's very little in terms of pure gore (although the gore that does occur is quite spectacular), but the eerie mood set by `Shadow of the Vampire' is darn near perfect.  Storywise &#150; well, again, there's no real surprises or Keyser Soze moments, but the writing is still good.  There's a lot of neat parallels made between the so-called `normal' characters and the vampire who walks among them; is there really much difference between a man who craves fame at any cost and a vampire who craves blood at any cost?  `Shadow of the Vampire' is a movie that relishes the small details, and the details are so good, it's relatively easily to forgive the obscene predictability of the plot.  The only complaint I had was the ending, which seemed somewhat convoluted . . . but it fit the film, and I'd be hard-pressed to think of anything that would be much better. `Shadow of the Vampire' is a hard film to pigeonhole into a single category &#150; at times, it's a dark comedy; at other times, it's a tragic film; and at still other times, it lives up to its heritage and becomes a truly gripping, disturbing horror film.  What's undeniable, though, is that `Shadow of the Vampire' is a smart, savvy film that is phenomenal to watch.  It's an offbeat, moody film that may not contain enough gore or action for fans of modern horror . . . but the story's pretty good, and most of the characters (and the actors) are so good, especially Willam Dafoe, that it's outstanding nonetheless.

He strays from Brit to German to Manhattan and back.  He's pretty predictable in this and probably figured he was on thin ice and tried to blow his character up to get some effect.  Didn't work.  The death scene is  gruesome and pretty good stuff but to get there is to slog through some weak writing and chaotic acting.

I like Malkovich, liked him in Mary Reilly and in Con-Air (a saving grace) and hated him in this.

He's worth the price of admission.  The film itself is interesting, but there is too much of a 'Murnau was God' feel to the script (I rush to explain, it is not the Muranau thinks he was God angle, but a feel that the scriptwriter thinks Murnau was God).Catherine McCormack plays the hopped up diva well, and Cary Elwes deserves a mention here along with Udo Kier.  Elwes always turns in a strong performance and this was no exception.The cabaret scene mentioned by another writer here really is out of place, as is a 'flash 'em, baby' bit with Ms McCormack later.The film is, eventually, disappointing after the hype it did receive.  A word of warning on the DVD--the trailer for Begotten is not for the weak of heart or stomach.

The way that director E. Elias Merhige, writer Steven Katz and all the actors (inparticular Dafoe) bring this story to the screen is what makes this work. There is a quality to the style that pays homage without getting in the way of the actual original's power over cinema, and the sense of dread mixed with comedy is about as close to anything as one might see aside from a Tim Burton movie (only here it's significantly darker and a little un-hinged).

YES, Dafoe was great, deserving of his nomination.  YES, Malkovich was also very good in his role.  YES, it was a very interesting and original premise.  But when you're looking for a movie that contains entertainment value, there just isn't much of it here.In the words of Homer Simpson...

I'm sure it will also appeal to old-school horror fans who remember Nosferatu, but beyond that, the audience is very, very limited.  Why?  Because despite excellent performances and an ambitious idea, this film remains a labour of love, an actor's movie, and for the average movie-goer, a complete waste of time.  And I'm not referring to a Bruckheimer fan when I say average... I think that even those intelligent viewers who would find redeeming qualities about and enjoy other weird experiments in film, would have a very hard time sitting through this one without rolling their eyes, sighing, and doing a lot of shifting around.  I killed several minutes re-reading the shockingly funny line on the cassette case, just to make sure I wasn't seeing things.This movie is NOT FUNNY.  At all.  Frankly, I think it's an insult to the world of comedy to say this film had any amusing moments, because I never once cracked a smile except once at Eddie Izzard when he made a stupid face.

Unfortunately, the movie tries too many things, wandering around a bit, to really become a classic.  Still, you have to love the premise.The film centers around the making of F.W. Murnau's classic silent film Nosferatu; presuming, that the actor who played the bald, long finger-nailed vampire actually WAS a vampire.  As filming progresses, the obsessive Murnau battles to keep his film on track and his bizarre star under wraps.As I've already said, the concept is the stuff of film geek discussion.  Hey, can you imagine if Schreck really wasn't acting?  And the filmmakers obviously have a love for the film they are inhabiting.  The performances by John Malkovich (as Murnau) and Willem Dafoe (as Schreck) are excellent.But the film seems almost too in love with its subject to take a step back and try to sort out what it's trying to say.  The movie takes stabs at being a historical picture, a portrait of Murnau the artist, a straight horror film, an examination of silent picture movie making, and also a dark comedy.  Some moments in each of these areas work, but others do not.  Still others are obscured because sometimes it's hard to see what the movie is getting at.Not to mention the film's ending is rather unclear and unsatisfying.  They spend a lot of time on Murnau's motivations, so I found it rather odd that I didn't understand his actions in the film's conclusions.  The movie probably could have stood a few more scenes as an epilogue.  As it stands, the finale is abrupt and strange.I applaud the movie for what it tries to do, it's gutsy, and different, and in this day of movies, that's not something one should take lightly.

The actors are all first-rate, but we don't really care about any of them, because the script never develops them, which makes it difficult to become involved in the movie.Eddie Izzard has the best bit as one of the supporting actors, recreating the hokey acting style of the early silent film actors so well I couldn't keep from laughing every time he did something.  But this in itself points up that there is something missing from the rest of the film; development, more preparation, and a stronger script.  Willem Defoe has a tour-de-force as the vampire, but there seems to be a lack of focus for his character, and for all his presence, we learn nothing about him to make us pity or care about him.  Malkovich plays his character so aloof and flat (even his voice is almost monotonal) he is almost totally disengaging, but the biggest indication of problems in the production are the disappearing german accents of the lead characters.  They are there somewhat in the beginning (non-convincingly) and then simply disappear by the middle of the picture!  This has been commented on by many reviewers, and speaks about the lack of continuity and development of the supporting characters.  The strongest character of course is the vampire Shreck, but he can only be so involving if the other characters are not given enough development, personality and life that we care about them, and their relationship with the monster.  If we learned more about the creature and the lives of the others, this would have been a much more powerful and engaging film.  A shame, because Defoe's character is so eerily dead-on.

The next plank in the scenario is more obvious - what if Nosferatu's director, F W Murnau, was a megalomaniac. The rest is easy - just raise the money, assemble a cast and crew, choose locations, and shoot it!  Except perhaps for casting the part of the vampire/Schreck - but that's easy too, because lurking in the recesses of movieland is a  mysterious being - going under the name of Willem Dafoe - who has such diabolical power to transform himself into a vampire that he, too, might be the genuine bloodsucking article. Casting the megalomaniac director really is a cinch - here's a part, at last, in which John Malkovich  can run the gamut from quiet, detached control to raging, bug-eyed hysteria, without being accused of hamming it up; and  he can use an accent the audience might find acceptable  (and perhaps it might erase the memory of  the ridiculous Russian in Rounders, or perhaps not).  But despite the efforts of Dafoe and Malkovich, as well as fine support like Eddie Izzard and Catherine McCormack, for me the real stars of Shadow are the set builders, lighting/camerapeople, and assorted technicians - under the leadership of director E Elias Merhige - who have managed to recreate the look and feel of a 1920s set and of the original B & W, silent movie. Because of that wonderful recreation, and the strong performances, it's easy to forgive a few faults in the overall execution. Others have criticised the ending; I was more doubtful about the first 20 or 30 minutes, when I thought the vampire should have made an earlier substantive entrance. One feels that some major scenes may also have been cut - otherwise, why does Malkovich/Murnau leave the set for a while in the middle of the movie.  Films about film-making often bring out the best in their makers, and this is certainly the case here.  Shadow of the Vampire is worthy to join Sunset Boulevard, Singin' in the Rain, Eight-and-a-half, Day for Night, and Living in Oblivion as a first-class, enjoyable movie in its own right, while providing lots of food for thought about the way creating a movie provides such a wonderful metaphor for life in general.

The filmmakers involved have done a highly credible job in capturing the essence of the story and the time period. Watching it is being transported back to another era, and it's fun. It, of course, starts with the originality and strength of Steven Katz's script. It then found itself in the hands of a director who understood what it was trying to show and say. And then great actors got onboard, obviously the always wonderful John Malkovich as the obsessed director F. W. Murnau, and Oscar nominee (rightly so) Willem Defoe as the real-life vampire/actor Max Shreck. I won't go on and on with the plot details because I always skim through other reviews that have them, because if I'm looking at a movie I tend to know the plot. But I will touch on the originality OF the plot and say that it proposes the idea that the actor is actually a vampire playing the part of an actor playing the part of a vampire. What a breath of fresh air in film plots! It's a fun, exciting film to see, and a feast for the eyes. It has wonderful color schemes and sets and shots. I have to say, the actor who stood out to me above the rest and stuck in my mind long afterwards was Catherine McCormack as Greta Schroder!! She LOOKED like a silent film actress. It's all in the eyes, and the face. She had a perfectly pale face matched with heavily-black eyes. In certain shots she looked strikingly like an actress from the twenties. This film also succeeds with perfect casting! I hope to see more of Catherine McCormack. Overall, this film is a fresh, original, daring piece of work that is gorgeous to think about, watch, see and hear. And that is what cinema is all about.

The intermittent scenes from Nosferatu in the frame ofMurnau's camera play off the action going on just outside the frame.Any five minute clip of this film would be interesting and well done. Still the film as a whole falls short.  I think that some of this may bedue to the mixture the film was going for.  There is the horror comedymix, which is pretty well done, there is the historical background,which starts to loose coherence, and then there are little bits like thevampire talking about why he didn't like the novel Dracula (it didn'tmirror his own life, so he found it horribly inaccurate) which try tointroduce a bit of philosophy.  So you get these bits where the vampireis being deep, and then he hisses at someone for comic relief.  This isOK in little parts, but overall it was instances like these which lostthe film it's footing.  In the end it gave me the impression of a verymuddled effect.Still, any short segment of the film that I can think of was prettygood, including the opening credits with a lot of moody zooms on celticstyle drawings.  These credits were so long that the end credits startedwith the main actor's stand-ins or something.  Anyway we're talkingreally long opening credits, so the fact that they were decent to watchsays a lot.  Anyhow the details are good.  I particularly liked thescenes with Murnau yelling at the actors or telling them something oddto get the proper reaction because the only other places I get to seesilent film type directing like this is on MTV's Making the Video.

If you are a fan of the horrorgenre or it sounds interesting to you then you might like it for theparts.  Seeing Nosferatu first would be a good idea, since this movieplays off it quite a bit, (there is also the possibility of it givingaway the plot to Nosferatu) and since Nosferatu is pretty good.

The script itself comes across as the cumulative efforts of a couple of guys doing bong hits.  Anyone who knows anything about the real history of Murnau and `Nosferatu' will be appalled, and those who aren't familiar with the background will simply be confused and bored.  Granted, the film was supposed to be taking `liberties' with its storyline, but if that's what Hollywood considers liberties, then they oughtta make a film about the Nazi invasion where Hitler is a beatnik and all the S.S officers wear tutus and do Jell-O shooters.But hey, if you like that sort of thing, or if you like watching paint dry, then by all means I recommend this film.

"},{"Title":"Merhige Captures A Sense Of Time And Place","Date":"13 March 2001","Score":"","Genre":"Drama, Horror","Review":"  	In 1921, German director F.W. Murnau began the first film adaptation of Bram Stoker's `Dracula,' and it soon became, not only one of the most celebrated horror films of all time, but the stuff of which legends are born.  Denied the rights to the book, Murnau merely changed the title to `Nosferatu,' Count Dracula became Count `Orlok,' and filming began.  `Shadow of the Vampire,' directed by E. Elias Merhige, is a chronicle of the making of the film, one which blends fact and fiction and successfully exploits the myth surrounding the entire project.  Fueling the fires of mystery that permeated the set was the fact that method/character actor Max Schreck, who played Count Orlok, was never seen by anyone without his makeup, which gave him a look that was a bit disconcerting to say the least.  And, according to this film, Murnau added to it all by confiding that Schreck was actually a real vampire playing an actor playing a vampire.  In any case, the atmosphere created by Murnau as they filmed `Nosferatu' certainly did the trick, as did the dark, unsettling aura created and maintained throughout by Merhige with this film. 	John Malkovich does an excellent job of bringing Murnau to life, giving him that sense of someone just slightly off-center; an unusual artist making a decidedly unusual film.  Malkovich's Murnau is a determined and adamant filmmaker who has the ability to stay in the moment, and whose philosophy is that `Anything beyond the frame doesn't exist.'  An interesting concept from one of the three most highly regarded German filmmakers of the time.  As Schreck/Orlok, Willem Dafoe gives an amazing performance that completely captures the essence of the man and his most famous on-screen character.  Off screen as well, Dafoe applied Schreck's method of only allowing himself to be seen in full make-up by cast and crew as they filmed, and the desired effect is fully realized-- by the other characters, as well as the audience-- in the anticipation of his first appearance in the film, which when it comes is cast in shadows that distort his figure while emphasizing his elongated fingers and nails.  It's quite an image, and does indeed create an indelible impression.  Merhige's approach not only works well, but is brilliant in conception and execution, evoking a dark sense of disquietude while sustaining the enigma of his actor/vampire.  And the B&W rushes of `Nosferatu,' as well as the glimpses `through' the lens we get as they film it, have an authentic look that further captures that sense of time and place that gives this film credibility and makes it so believable.  Most of the film takes place `on set,' or at least in the proximity thereof, and the atmosphere created by Merhige draws you in and makes you a part of it all; it gives you the feeling of actually `being there.' 	The terrific supporting cast includes Cary Elwes (Fritz), Udo Kier (Albin Grau), Eddie Izzard (Gustav), Aden Gillett (Henrick), Ronan Vibert (Wolfgang) and Catherine McCormack (Greta).  Extremely well crafted and presented by Merhige, with a number of memorable performances (especially Dafoe's), `Shadow of the Vampire' is a rare treat to be experienced and savored.  It's a dark film, but not depressingly so, delivered with intelligence and just enough humor to offset the drama, as when Schreck at one point says to Murnau, `I don't think we need the writer anymore.'  A classic line from a film that I am sure will in time be considered a classic in it's own right.  An engrossing behind-the-scenes look at the creative process that makes the magic of the movies a reality, and for film buffs especially, it is one that must not be missed.  I rate this one 9/10.

So Murnau called his character Count Orlov and his movie Nosferatu. Stoker's character is suave, handsome and a hit with the ladies.  Murnau's Count is bald, has ratty teeth and pointed ears.  He is gruesome, ugly and would not go over well in the drawing room.Shadow of the Vampire is ripping with comic excess.  The names of the characters are too stereotypically German.  There is an aura of unacknowledged camp dripping from some of the characters.  The Weimar Decadence seems evident in many scenes.  Every main character is on one opiate or another.  At the same time, the movie seems austere.  These characters are stoic and serious.  Whats going on here?Right away there is a mystery about the lead actor, Max Schreck (Willem Dafoe). Scenes have been filmed on sets in Berlin before the production arrives on location.  The first night the Company meets Schreck. He is eerie and horrible.  Still the Madhatters from Berlin try to pretend that he is not scaring them to death. We're all seasoned troupers and all that. Humor will be necessary on this movie, to get over the rough spots.The scenes between Schreck and Gustav Von Wangenheim, who is buying property from the Count, are filmed.  Those scenes and all others are staged almost exactly as they were in Murnau's original Nosferatu. On occasion Director E. Elias Merhige substitutes scenes from Murnau's 1922 version.  It is difficult to tell the difference.Suddenly the cameraman collapses.  Old Vampire Hands in the Audience know at once that the Wily Schreck must have been at work the night before. Murnau, played by John Malkovich, is outraged.  Murnau is almost always outraged. He takes Schreck aside and tells him he must not do this again.  Now the audience is on to the fact that Schreck is a REAL vampire.After a couple of days, we realize that Schreck has a deal with Murnau to leave the cast alone.  But the cameraman is dying from suspicious neck wounds.  Murnau confronts Schreck and invokes the whole History and Nobility of filmmaking to get the Vampire to cut it out.  To no avail. Schreck says he won't continue on the film unless he lances the neck of anyone he cares to, including self-centered leading lady Greta Schroder (Catherine McCormack).  His rage spent, Murnau tacitly agrees to the new deal.  He MUST complete his project!While Murnau planes off to Berlin for a replacement cameraman, the film's writer, and Producer Albin Grau, have an extraordinary conversation about the script with Schreck at Twilight. The threesome pass around a large bottle of schnapps.  Schreck says the writer doesn't understand the difficulty a Vampire has in trying to pretend to be hospitable to a stranger when he has lived alone for over 500 years.  The speech is the most serious in the film.  Willem DaFoe captures the loneliness of the Creature, speaking of the difficulty of trying to remember how he should appear to an ordinary man. The scene is as powerful as any I've seen. The drunken writer and producer are, by turns, awed by Schreck's ability to understand his character and shocked when the actor grabs a bat from the air, rips off its head with his teeth, and drinks its blood.Murnau returns with a new swashbuckling cameraman, Fritz Arno Wagner (Cary Elwes).  Wagner brings an energy to the film that has been missing up to this point. His character resembles real-life directors Eric Fleming and William Wellman. He also brings a ton of camera know-how and enough varieties of drugs to power two movies like this one.The film really begins to move now.  Murnau is manic.  Schreck tears into members of the Cast while they are still on the set filming.  Its getting hard to ignore what is going on. The film is a little stupid this way because its funny. Its about Germans, you know, and for laughs they are considered a little thick. Finally, in a drugged stupor, Murnau admits there is no Max Schreck, that he discovered this real Vampire while scouting locations for the film.  The movie moves toward denouement.Shadow of the Vampire is choppy and shortened like the TV commercials that Mirhige usually directs.  But the movie doesn't have to work perfectly as a piece of movie machinery.  The mixture of comedy and seriousness and the wonderful performances, give the film enormous power even if the editing and story-telling aren't perfect.But the film is not for everyone.It helps to have seen F. W. Murnau's 1921 Silent Nosferatu and Werner Herzog's 1979 color remake. It helps to know that German actor Udo Dier, who plays Producer Albin Grau in this film, played Andy Warhol's Dracula in 1974.  Dier was a straight actor then. He was so funny sucking the blood of weregins (virgins) only, that ever since he has been cast in strictly comic roles. He can no longer say a line in his thick German accent that does not make one laugh. Eddie Uzzo is an English comic female impersonator who has performed his act for HBO.  His performance as the actor playing the character  buying land from Nosferatu is awfully good.  Malkovich and Cary Elwes, who plays Fritz Arno Wagner, slip out of their faked German accents on occasion.  I think they do it on purpose to add to the serendipity of the movie.  The film's tone is the same as the overwrought German expressionism of Murnau's 1921 Original.  Malkovich's performance is a hoot. He reminds me of Colin Clive's Victor Frankenstein, and a little bit of the former Nazi Scientists who are always caricatured in American space films like the Right Stuff. Malkovich as Murnau is a mad scientist, putting together an unearthly creature Nosferatu.

So Shadow of a Vampire, while conceptually interesting, is the worst kind of a put-on, one where everyone already knows everything.   How could it have been improved?  For one, make Dr. Orlock more than a stick figure who comes out only at night to frighten his fellow cast members.  If all we know of the Willem Dafoe character is that he has a reprehensible snicker, very long fingernails, and a compulsion to drink the blood of his leading lady, then we really don't care what happens to him.  For another, develop the characters beyond just what happens when they are being filmed.  The lead actor, Gustav, mysteriously vanishes after his sequences with Dr. Orlock, the leading lady, Greta, shows up only in the beginning and at the end, and there are glimpses of drug-seeking behavior in director F.W. Murna  and in the star actress, for which the film never explores.  Finally, don't depend merely on the black and white images to create a dramatic effect when a lame script and soundtrack can't help you.

Murnau, the director of the classic vampire film Nosferatu. The most impressive thing about this film, in my opinion, is the way that that vampire was brought back to life. Willem Dafoe played, with nearly flawless accuracy, Max Schreck, the actor who played the part of the vampire in 1922 when Nosferatu was filmed. This is an amazing performance because it is so complex, although at times Dafoe overacted a bit. I'm always impressed when people play roles in which they portray someone else who is also playing a role. Jim Carrey, for example, did this in Man on the Moon, as well as on an episode of the Conan O'Brien show, in which he played O'Brien playing Carrey. In that show, Carrey played a comedian impersonating a comedian impersonating a comedian (himself). In Shadow of the Vampire, Dafoe does this as well; he plays the part of a vampire impersonating a person impersonating a vampire. Shadow of the Vampire is about the making of Nosferatu, except that there is the small addition that Max Schreck is a vampire in real life, and the reason that he would only ever appear on the set in full make-up is because that's what he really looked like, he really was Nosferatu. It's not hard to see how this story was realized, because not only is it true that Schreck would only appear in full make-up, but this was also the only film that he ever appeared in. I think that this is one of the things that makes this such an interesting film, because it is filmed and presented in a way that relates directly to real life, making the supernatural element of it much more effective. Malkovich and Dafoe have excellent chemistry on screen as the director and the star of Nosferatu, and this relationship is made even more interesting when it becomes clear that Schreck really is Nosferatu, that it's not just an act, and that Murnau knows about it. The way that Murnau tries to keep this a secret, even at the cost of the lives of members of his crew, suggests a tremendous dedication to the making of the film, which is now hailed as a milestone in cinematic history. People who are not interested in the history of film or filmmaking or horror classics are likely to be bored and ultimately disappointed by Shadow of the Vampire. But if it is viewed with an open mind, this is a really good movie. It not only presents an interesting story - that of the making of a vampire film in which the vampire is portrayed by a real vampire &#150; but it also has strong ties to reality, a quality that is extremely rare among horror films. With the right state of mind, I think that almost anyone could enjoy this film.   "},{"Title":"Merhige's second not suffering from sophomore slump","Date":"15 February 2001","Score":"","Genre":"Drama, Horror","Review":"  Shadow of the Vampire (E. Elias Merhige, 2000)Elias Merhige's first film, Begotten, is one of Nicolas Cage's favorite movies. So when Cage started up his production company and financed his first flick, he called Merhige. He had other reasons, of course, but the rather tenuous connection has caused a number of people who have seen both movies to ask why Merhige came out of semi-retirement (and a lucrative business designing stage sets and directing creepy videos for Marilyn Manson) to work on a film that's as commercially accessible as Begotten was commercially deadly?The obvious reason that no one seems to have come up with is that Merhige is one of only two living directors who's made a major silent film, and Mel Brooks would have been inappropriate for the material. The less obvious reason is that Merhige's favorite trope, the long repetition cut, makes itself known in this movie. It's far more subtle than it was in Begotten-- no ten-minute shots of robed figures dragging Son of Earth up a hill in this one. But as in Begotten, there are long, loving shots of landscape (and I use the term loosely; the most noticeable shot like this focuses on different parts of the train for a few minutes) with action going on around them that has nothing, really to do with the landscape whatsoever. The juxtaposition is just out-of-kilter enough to add a veneer of disturbance. With the increased action in this film, the viewer is less compelled to focus on the juxtaposition, and thus less disturbed; but for this film, in the back of the mind is enough.Much has been made (and very rightly so) of Willem Dafoe's portrayal of Count Orlok, who takes on the persona of character actor Max Schreck through a shady deal with obsessed film director F. W. Murnau (John Malkovich). Dafoe does a fantastic job not only of playing Count Orlok as a vampire who's forced by his own greed into contact with humans he can't kill, but he also takes the silent-film exaggeration of statement and uses it in a sound film. It's unexpected, and it's wonderful. Dafoe is quite deserving of his Best Supporting Actor nomination, but if you're a betting man, remember that Dafoe was overlooked for his two finest roles (in The Last Temptation of Christ and To Live and Die in L.A.).All the flap over Dafoe's brilliance has unfortunately eclipsed some of the minor performances in the movie which are equally as brilliant, e.g. Udo Kier as the perpetually-stressed producer Albin Grau, Catherine McCormack as the spoiled and bitchy star of the film, Eddie Izzard as her co-star, and Cary Elwes as a replacement cameraman (after the original, played by Ronan Vibert, is sent to the hospital thanks to Orlok's inability to, erm, contain himself) whose arrival on the scene is the catalyst that sets everything in motion.Elwes' role, and the way his arrival changes the dynamic of the film set, is the one piece of this film that elevates it from an amusing, hyperbolic character sketch of a director who will go to any lengths to get his film and a piece of art. While Elwes himself is about as subtle as a cold chisel to the ear, the effects of his coming are masked by his (and those around him) aping until the final scene, when the true implications of the whole mess come to light. The final scene is so beautifully set up, and so well constructed, that the payoff would have been worth any number of errors. Fortunately, we have very few to contend with, most of which have nothing to do with the film itself (the person who composed the main title credits, for example, should be exiled from Hollywood forevermore).As a side note, the actual scenes we see Murnau directing are quite close to the scenes in the original. Given the flights of fantasy used in other parts of the film, this is a detail that could have easily been overlooked, but it wasn't. Kudos.While it's not Begotten-- nothing that's come out since has equaled the artistry and beauty of Begotten-- one can't say by any means that Merhige cound himself in a sophomore slump. To the contrary, the accessibility, the likability, of this film is astonishing, given the endurance-test qualities of Begotten. Very highly recommended. **** "},{"Title":"superb portrayal of the legend, though not quite scary enough","Date":"15 February 2001","Score":"","Genre":"Drama, Horror","Review":"  The first vampire movie ever, Nosferatu, is credited as being something of a silent era masterpiece.

As a homage to the vampire genre, this lack of terror is a shortcoming, giving it at times a slightly 'art for art's sake' pretentiousness, but the overall effect is impressive. At the end we can almost taste the foul stench of death that the vampire lives on. If Nosferatu was one of the most convincing portrayals of a vampire ever made, Defoe gives a stunning re-creation, and in doing so creates another masterful characterization. Overall the film is a welcome, thoughtful, and seriously thought-provoking enlivenment of the vampire tradition and a much needed change from schlock-horror vampire movies on the one hand or soft-porn comedy vampire movies on the other. "}{"Title":"He casts no Shadow","Date":"12 February 2001","Score":"","Genre":"Drama, Horror","Review":"  F.W. Murnau's 1922 silent horror &#145;Nosferatu' is a genuine classic of must-see proportions, but the same regrettably cannot be said of this oddity based loosely on events surrounding the original production. Initially shot against the backdrop of a convincingly decadent looking 1920s Berlin, the premise is relatively straightforward  &#150; Mernau, (played by an unusually one-dimensional John Malkovich), decides to shoot his own version of Dracula having been refused the rights by Bram Stoker's estate, changing the Count's name to Orlock and casting a mysterious actor Max Schreck in the title role. The rest of the cast and crew are informed that Schreck (an almost unrecognisable Willem Dafoe) is a method actor who briefly studied under Stanislafsky. Consequently when they arrive on location, leaving behind what Murnau describes as &#145;the artifice of the studio', Schreck insists on appearing in full costume and make-up, and that shooting can only be carried out at night. Factual inaccuracies aside (the necessary film stock for night shoots hadn't been developed in 1922), the first third of this film displays some definite potential, refusing to conform to any generic ideal and swinging with occasional accomplishment between moments of high comedy and unsettling horror. The film rapidly becomes unstuck when it's revealed that Murnau has made some fairly unconventional casting decisions in his quest for the ultimate in cinematic authenticity. Schreck is neither employing the Method to get into the part of Orlock, nor is he strictly human. Whilst ignoring the exceptional performance of the actual Schreck in the original, this revisionist perspective is certainly interesting, and it's a shame that it's revealed far too early in the film. Had director E. Elias Merhige kept his audience guessing as to Schreck's true nature, the whole experience would have been considerably more rewarding. Whilst the individual performances, notably a fiendishly OTT Dafoe and a spoofy Eddie Izzard (as the increasingly uneasy hero Gustav von Wangerheim) are invitingly watchable, the story as a whole fails to gel satisfactorily or sustain the viewer's attention.  It's more of an exercise in psychological disintegration than a traditional horror movie, focusing on Murnau's obsessive need to complete the film at any cost. It becomes apparent that the despotic and drug-addicted director has entered into an almost Faustian pact with Schreck, promising him the neck of young starlet Greta Schroeder (Catherine McCormack) in return for his undead performance. He's fully aware of the morbid implications of his actions throughout; but by the time he realises that it's Schreck who controls the agenda it's far too late for his cast and crew, and also unfortunately most of the struggling audience. Some fairly fragmented editing inhibits any detailed development of characters and narrative structure, and the ultimate message that Murnau is more of a monster than his pitifully tragic leading man is blatantly signposted from the outset. For a film that attempts to evoke the dramatic gravitas of &#145;Gods and Monsters' or the comedy value of the far superior &#145;Ed Wood', &#145;Shadow of the Vampire' ultimately captures neither. "},{"Title":"The boundaries between fiction and reality collapse","Date":"11 February 2001","Score":"","Genre":"Drama, Horror","Review":"  I think the title of the film means a great deal Shadow of the Vampire. The emphasis should not really be on Vampire so much but on Shadow, for this is a movie that deals with the murky phantasmagoria that lays between what is real and what is imagined----that inbetweenedness which is just so naturally a part of the imaginative act, the artistic process of change----taking that which is in the mind, part of phantasie, and making it Real.  (Of course drugs, as is often the case with Romantics, seem to play a huge role in this chain of events...)Murnau, brilliantly played by Malkovich, is a director driven by a personal vision so powerful that he would stop at nothing to see it brought to fruition. For him, film is not something which exists merely in a static and reductivist world--the film is never just a thing to made, something which exists independently from the director---it is poetry in motion, a synthesis of art, even a contextual frame in which other art, such as music, reaches a higher meaning.  But most of all it is Murnau's dream come true, as it offers the best hope of projecting outward the internal monologue of the creative act----Film would seem to be the ultimate expression of exhibitionism for the starry-eyed Romantic.It is ALL real to him. Therefore he has to find a star to whom the film will be MORE than just a film---so he finds Schreck, who purportedly believes himself to be a real vampire. For Schreck, also brilliantly portrayed, the film might as well be a documentary of sorts. Whether or not he really thinks he IS a vampire, or if it merely the total immersion technique of the Stanislavski school taken to the Nth degree of perfection is immaterial to Murnau.Then there is the fractured, dreamlike quality of the scenes. One vista blends into another--bizarre events just happen--people appear as if out of nowhere. If this progression is simply a byproduct of film editing and cutting then it is at the very least a brilliant accident, for it further accentuates the extended reverie of Murnau which is the very heart and soul of Shadow of the Vampire. This technique (or accident) is one of the best examples of form following function I have seen in a movie.I can't give anything away here (nor would I want to) but the sequence of strange events which occur at the film's end are best interpreted as one last grand juxtaposition of narcotics, Imagination, and romantic vision (with perhaps a touch of insanity thrown in). Murnau says something to the effect of the only thing that is real is in the frame---It is the moment of truth where all comes together, Nosferatu, played by Schreck, directed by Murnau, played by Malkovich, directed by Merhinge with all the stops pulled out and all the layers of meaning collapsing together in a play of shadows which reaches out and seduces the audience into one final collaboration with the Artist's interpretation of reality.  "},{"Title":"Horror & Satire","Date":"10 February 2001","Score":"","Genre":"Drama, Horror","Review":"  Shadow of the Vampire recounts the making of the 1922 German classic - Nosferatu, eine Symphonie des Grauens, directed by F. W. Murnau. It portrays Murnau (John Malkovich) as an obsessed, fanatical perfectionist who is prepared to sacrifice everything, including his actors and crew to complete his masterpiece. Murnau makes a sinister pact with Max Schreck (Willem Dafoe) a vampire, playing an actor playing a vampire. Although the accuracy of this film is questionable, the premise that Nosferatu was in fact a vampire is an exceptionally good one.The film possesses an independent, foreign quality with its European setting and lack of Hollywood-style pretense. The movie blends contemporary film visuals with black and white film. When the black and white film scenes of Nosferatu are shown, incredibly, Dafoe resembles perfectly the original Nosferatu. The majority of scenes are set in dimly lit or dark places, evoking suspense, anticipation and fear. These dark scenes are effectively contrasted with scenes of glaring daylight which force the audience to momentarily shy-away from the bright 'daylight' of the screen, relaying to the viewers Schreck's repulsion to daylight.From the opening credits, its suspense-filled music and thought-provoking visuals gradually build the intensity and suspense of the film. The actors, and even the horses that transport the crew to Czechoslovakia, seem apprehensive about their arrival. However, anticipation turns to perplexity when Nosferatu, who has the locals terrified, appears on the screen.I was confronted by a vampire with a bizarre, comical expression. Dafoe's character was completely out of synch with the movie up until that point, and would have been better suited to Scary Movie, or one of Leslie Nielsen's satirical flicks. Though Dafoe possesses an uncanny resemblance to the original Nosferatu, he is bewilderingly laughable which reduces the movie to low-grade satire. This robs the movie of any future suspense.However, one of the more effective and powerful scenes in the film is when Nosferatu views himself on film. He, at first, studies his projected image on the white curtains, then stares straight into the camera lens, as if trying to capture the very essence of his being. It is at this point that he becomes aware that he is the star of the show, and with stardom, he realises, unreasonable demands can be made.Despite Dafoe's baffling portrayal of Nosferatu, he is quite the comedian at times with film-savvy in-jokes, such as his remonstration that he's entitled and justified in eating the writer before the film is finished, claiming writers are unnecessary to complete the film.There are no outstanding performances among the supporting actors. Catherine McCormack, who plays the narcissistic female lead in Nosferatu is the only actor who effectively embraces her role. Udo Kier's bland performance as the producer, along with the rest of the cast, adds little to the film.What you have in the end is a satirical, fictional look at the making of Nosferatu. Though there are no standout performances, Dafoe has received considerable praise for his portrayal of Nosferatu, but for my money you have to do more than have an uncanny resemblance to the original character. It has even been suggested that he already has an Oscar in the bag. I believe the Oscar ought to go to, if anyone, the make-up department for making Dafoe look so extraordinarily like the original Nosferatu. I simply cannot take Dafoe's character seriously. If horror and satire can be combined effectively, this film didn't demonstrate it.** 1/2  stars  "},{"Title":"Time doesn't flow, it skips","Date":"8 February 2001","Score":"","Genre":"Drama, Horror","Review":"  My impression is that the original cut was twice as long as the final movie.

I also felt that some of the main characters are not completely developed, even though their roles are important you really don't connect to them (before they die).There are excellent scenes scattered throughout the movie though. My favorite is the one when Max Schreck (the vampire) comments about the book Dracula...Overall, an interesting movie that suffers from fragmented editing that takes away a lot of the enjoyment. I think that the addition of a few more minutes (between the scene changes to fill out the details and make the movie flow better) would make this one a truly great movie.Even considering that I love the subject, the cast is superb and there are a lot of great individual moments in the movie, I still failed to really enjoy it as a whole because of the way it was put together.

Malkovich was great--Malkovich was awful; The credits were too long--The credits were fantastic--The film is a great tribute to a great film--Murnau must be spinning in his grave--just amazing. To one review in particular I must take exception--silent film directors often DID talk their actors through their movements while filming, which is one reason that so many of them, Murnau included, were not pleased by the coming of sound. Murnau said that he would have nothing to do with talkies--his sudden death prevented our finding out if he would've remained true to his word. Also, cameras were often cranked at different speeds. Most of the film techniques, except maybe the night shooting, were very accurate. I don't believe they had a fast enough stock for night shooting in 1921, and all the night shots in Nosferatu are day for night, shot in daylight then tinted blue to resemble nighttime. I thought a fine job was done creating the world of 1920's German filmmaking, a heady time if there ever was one. I didn't really mind that the accents drifted in and out at times--I feel if you notice that kind of stuff up front, you're not paying attention to the film--it hasn't caught you up. I had that watching X-Men, but that's another review. All involved in Shadow... are to be complemented for a job well done, including Eddie Izzard, who seemed to have the most stable and positive response from almost all the review. Embarrassingly, I had never heard of him before seeing this film! He was quite excellent, though and missed from the ending scene (which that character is in in the Murnau original). The ending scene is the only part I have some trouble with. It seems as if they just ran out of steam and relied on a bit of shock to end it.

It does a good job of capturing the innovation and artistry that the director-pioneers of the silent film era employed to create their masterpieces.John Malkovich plays the silent film director Friedrich Wilhelm Murnau, an important figure in the development of movies, as we know them today. Malkovich's Murnau is a meticulous man, often seeing to details himself in order to protect his project.  Who were these early men who developed this new art form?  The movie does a good job of illustrating the obsessive attention to detail, the dedication to art and the clear focus on the end product that is required to break new ground.  Murnau is excited about shooting on location, leaving behind what he calls the studio artifice.Willem Dafoe's Max Schreck is hilarious and hideous.  Schreck may be hundreds of years old, but he is still vain and still hopes to get the pretty girl.  Dafoe does a great job of balancing the human and the inherent monster.This is a very strong cast.  Versatile Cary Elwes turns in a great performance as cinematographer Fritz Wagner.  Wagner himself is another legend.  He worked as the cinematographer on over 100 films, beginning his career in 1919 and working on three films the year he died (1953).  In Shadow, Wagner is the second cinematographer and he introduces another element to the location -- a cornucopia of opiates.The drugs and the decadent atmosphere of pre-World War II Germany (Nosferatu was made in1922) add to the probability of the movie's conclusion.  The movie raises the unanswerable questions, what sacrifices are demanded to create art?  How do you balance the business of show business with the ability to complete a project?

Murnau at least had some modicum of an excuse for his moral blindness.  But what about the rest of the crew?  The men who find out the vampire is real and that Murnau plans to feed the leading lady to her?  Any moral outrage?  Any attempt by the men, who had apparently been Greta's friends and lovers, to help her?  Well, they did dope her up when she realized she was a sacrifice to her art.  What was their excuses?I believe these men (and Greta herself) were so immersed in a milieu so devoid of morality that they could no longer recognize evil; even when it sat right down next to them and shared a bottle of schnapps.  As a country-western song says, If you don't stand for something, you'll fall for anything.  And so the crew fell for Murnau's story of the method actor - who looks like a animate corpse, who eats bats, who they see attack a co-worker, who casts no reflection, who the director is feeding the leading lady to.

So, did it live up to my expectations? Well, lets see. Lets face it, in the time of `Buffy the Vampire' slayer, we can pretty much say the tale of the vampire has for the most part run it's course. But what we have here is actually something different and welcome. I have to say I was a bit surprised by the film's running time, a mere 1 hour and 23 minutes is hardly enough time to tell a compelling tale, in this authors humble opinion. But once I got past the drawn out and unnecessary montage of pointless imagery in the opening credits, I was wonderfully entertained. I have to admit, by the short running time, the picture did leave a few plot points lingering. It could have used a bit more set up for its back-story and a better explanation, at times, about some of the events that took place. However, where this movie lacked in substance, it soured with the performances of Malkovich and Dafoe. At times I wondered, was that Dafoe or did they `dig up' an actor for his part as well? This author's lips will utter the lines, 'I'll eat her later' and `This is hardly your picture any longer' for years to come. As far as E.Elias Merhige directing ability, I can't say it helped or harmed the film. His transitions from `reality' to the black and white vision of the Camera was a nice touch, but he did not leave me with any jaw dropping shots or truly memorable sequences. The story moved at a nice pace and kept the right tone and feel throughout for this type of movie, so he at least did his job in that respect.

But the surprise treats awaiting the viewer here include some subtle and complex musings on the nature of film, vampirism, predation and immortality, and a stunning performance by Willem Dafoe as Max Schreck - an alternate universe Schreck, of course, since in this version, director Murnau has placed a genuine vampire in the landmark role of Count Orlock. When I say stunning, I'm serious. Vampire performances by and large have become flat, rote exercises in cliche; rarely if ever do they even bother to develop a personality, let alone suggest any unique qualities of the vampire life. (If you saw Dracula 2000, accept my sympathy.) But Dafoe's Schreck/Orlock is just wonderful, a hungry, scheming, dangerous entity which is also proud, pitiable, very funny, touchingly sad, and absolutely not human. The shadow of the vampire is in one sense film itself, the only place this reflectionless creature can see its own likeness. Just look at the scene in which the fascinated vampire watches film footage shot in daylight - something he has not seen in ages - shadowing the film with his spidery talons in a gesture caught between evil omen and innocent shadow-puppet. Even better, the scene everyone else has quoted, in which Schreck reflects on the saddest moments in Stoker's Dracula - the realization that a being centuries old can forget how to pass for human, forget even the simplest things of human life.  This shading of horror into pity is a quality we've almost lost after decades of shallow movies about well-groomed, pretty vampires, and it is a rare pleasure to see it brought so perceptively back into play. There's a lot more here to enjoy. Malkovich is great to watch as the obsessive, almost parasitic Murnau, forcing the vampire through the chaotic final scenes by the sheer intensity of his will. Eddie Izzard's wide-eyed recreation of the original Hutter performance is spot-on (no, he is not exaggerating!), as are the exquisite copies of shots from Nosferatu itself. If you expect an accurate historical documentary, you'll be disappointed (can't figure out these people who are complaining that the film shows Schreck dying, when he made many movies after Nosferatu; guys, the Max Schreck in this flick is a for-real vampire! This ain't the real Max we're talking about here! Buy a clue!); if you expect a standard horror/vampire movie, you'll be disappointed; if you're even expecting a camp romp about monster-moviemaking on the order of Ed Wood, you won't get that either.

All you have to do is check the IMDB listings to see that Max Schreck made twenty movies after Nosferatu. But that's not the point.

In that it is mostly successful. But the transfer between the clearly comedic - and the frightening and horrific - is rather abrupt, so much so I was left wondering if I was supposed to smile sardonically at some of the end scenes - before it became obvious I was NOT supposed to!But overall this movie is well worth a look and is generally successful. For fans of German Expressionism - and especially for those who loved the original Nosferatu - Shadow of the Vampire is a must.By the way, for those who saw Shadow but not Nosferatu do NOT think for a second the original was in any way funny or quaint; it was and remains very creepy and scary.As a final note, the performances here are are all good, especially John Malkovich and, of course, a marvelous tour de force by an unrecognizable Willem Dafoe.Check it out!

How can we keep quiet when we see our vampire Max Schreck (Willem Dafoe), growing more and more frustrated, decide that production will improve and his bloodlust will be sated by stating We don't need the writer anymore.The cast is extraordinary.  The grotesque humor of Dafoe and the raging dedication of John Malkovich's F.W.

And horror fans will be especially delighted to see Udo Kier as Nosferatu's producer, as intense and hypnotic a presence as ever.Above all, this movie takes exciting risks.  It features one of the longest but most beautiful title sequences I've ever seen.  And while we watch these first few credits, we sit in total silence until faintly the sound of an old film projector rises and the gorgeous gothic score creeps up.

His pathos is pitch perfect the two best scenes are when Murnau tries to strangle him but finds that Shreck not only is unfazed by the throttling but welcomes the upping of the ante and the scene in which other crew members question him around a fire, asking about vampirehood while they all pass around a bottle of schnapps.  But it's just not enough.I was amazed at just how lifeless and unfunny the film was.

As he stares directly into the lens and turns the crank, it almost brings a tear to your eye.Another is the night-time scene with the producer, writer and lead 'actor' sitting around a fire drinking schnapps.

It became boring.  It seemed as though none of the characters were going to receive any more development.  We were stuck with simply finishing the shoot.Yet there are hints that there may have been more to the film than appeared on the screen.  Murnau is seen going to some place where there is lots of sexual decadence is going on all around him.  His leading lady has a morphine addiction.  He has a laudanum addiction.  One of the cast members apparently disappears, yet no one seems to notice.Without giving any plot elements away, let's just say that this film is very loosely based on the filming of Nosferatu.  Normally, I don't have any problem dealing with writers who take liberties with public domain personalities.  (The film Immortal Beloved works beautifully, but is almost entirely fiction -- ask any musicologist.)

Are we to belive that Shreck ate and drank BAT in front many of the crew without any of them saying anything or doing anything, even if the director was mad to get his film made?  I found myself questioning to much of the HISTORY, and who and what Max Shreck actually was, by the end of the flick.

This epic struggle between genius and artifice is set during the decadence of the Roaring Twenties in Berlin and other German locations. The making of the classic horror film NOSFERATU, A SYMPHONY OF HORROR is merely the setting for a free-for-all lambasting of method acting, art used as a weapon, the demonic fits that seize artists, and the general love-hate addiction that all artists feel toward their art.Movie-making is presented through the metaphor of blood-sucking. All actors, directors, and other artists long for the eternal life that their creations bring them while realizing the irony that the prize may be something they will never experience within their own lifetimes. Art mirroring life and life mirroring art is presented in the idea that, as Malkovich puts it, if it's not in the camera frame, it doesn't exist.

Elias Merhige asks the compelling question of how far any of us are willing to push the limits of a personal Mephistophelean bargain in order to achieve some ill-begotten immortality.In 1922, the great German expressionist film-maker, F.W. Murneau (played by John Malkovich), directed a film derived from Bram Stoker's Dracula called Nosferatu, possibly the greatest vampire movie in the history of the medium.  Unfortunately, Stoker's widow would not give him the rights, so Murneau went ahead with the project anyway, camouflaging his work by changing the names of the characters (e.g. Dracula became Count Orlock). This feast of imagination was not unlike Clark Kent wearing glasses so no one could divine his real identity.  Needless to say, Stoker's widow followed Murneau through the courts into the next several incarnations.To play the part of the vampire, he hired an unknown actor named Max Shreck (shreck is German for fright).  Shreck (portrayed by Willem Dafoe) was unarguably the ugliest and creepiest Dracula ever portrayed on the silver screen.  His presence was so forbidding, that a rumour actually circulated at the time that Shreck, was in fact, a vampire.Picking up on this conceit, Merhige put forth the following conundrum was the unknown that Murneau had hired a Stanislavsky trained actor (who always stayed in character throughout the shoot) portraying a vampire, or was he a vampire portraying an actor portraying a vampire?  While the audience begins to work out this dilemma, Shreck/Orlock starts to leave a trail of blood.In the meantime, the plot reveals that Murneau has worked out his own deal with Shreck, which involves some unthinkable reward for his quite unique take on the role.  And as the characters assume their characters, Murneau begins to assuage the fears of the cast in their work with this unsavoury character actor.  Particularly, he promises Greta, the female lead (Catherine McCormack, who starred in the under-appreciated Dangerous Beauty), that her work in this role will guarantee her immortality.Unlike most horror offerings, this thoughtful work challenges us with considering to what degree a film maker's (and by extension, our own) obsessions become vampiric relative to the sacrifices that they demand of others.  The legends are rampant  Hitchcock commenting that actors should be treated like cattle; Carl Theodore Dreyer (Rene Falconetti in The Passion of Joan of Arc)  and Lars Van Triers (Bjork in Dancer in the Dark) pushing their female leads to the point where they decided never again to endure the torture of making another picture.The camera promises a level of immortality unique in our time  the enshrinement of voice and image on film.  But to what degree might anyone be tempted to sacrifice everything for eternal life in any walk of life? What price Hollywood?  What human cost might a general assume for the taking of the next blood soaked piece of real estate?  How many business bodies to trample in the quest for the first billion?   Or even, what price family in quest of financial security?From that perspective, one could argue that Shadow..  is a rather graphic and colorful depiction of idol worship, and how within the context of some higher aim we can commit incalculable harm.  In addition to the brilliant performances (I would consider it a grave injustice of Dafoe does not receive the Best Supporting Actor Award from the Academy), this film dares us to form a relationship both with Murneau and his horror.  And as a dazzling display of horror, suspense, and dark comedy, this film works extraordinarily well.****, and clearly one of the best films of the year.

At least in these instances the actors have the option of studying the lives of or spending time with people in those positions.  But how do you instill the proper motivation for someone who is portraying a mythical character, such as demon, a werewolf or a vampire?

Nosferatu his latest film is sure to raise the bar - based on an unsavory Count with a penchant for blood sucking, Murnau needs to find someone who can bring him to life on the big screen.  Imagine his joy upon discovering Max Schreck, a real vampire, who is willing to work for scale, or at least a few actors on the scales. I have never seen Nosferatu in its entirety, but have always marveled at its ability to convey terror using limited special effects and basic lighting techniques.   Even with these limitations, Schreck's Count Orlock continues to be one of the most terrifying vampires ever brought to the screen.  I was therefore thrilled by Dafoe's portrayal in this film - between the makeup and his mannerisms he is fantastic.  Not only is Dafoe's Schreck darkly menacing, he has a sense of humor and curiosity as well.  Of course, being a vampire he also tends to be a tad unpredictable, biting bites, sucking back vodka, and snacking on the cast between takes.   Malkovich is also excellent as the obsessive, and annoying Murnau.  It is only when you realize the deal that has been struck between these two that you begin to wonder who the real monster of the piece is - at least Shreck kills to survive.   Eddie Izzard's portrayal of Gustav is so similar to the original that it is quite eerie.  This attention to detail extends to the film itself.  Unlike Gus Van Sant's pointless and painfully boring 1998 remake of Psycho, which was merely a copy of the original film scene for scene and shot for shot, Nosferatu merely serves as the background for  Shadow.  The recreated scenes are cleverly done and blend seamlessly with the few original shots.  In addition, the film is careful not to take itself too seriously, and has a B movie, slapstick undercurrent running throughout. Except for a few slow-moving sections, film buffs will thoroughly enjoy this take on the horror genre and its commentary on film-making in general.  "},{"Title":"Riveting! Inspiring!

Underneath it all - six feet underneath! - are eerie parallels between film itself and the world of the undead.  Real life color turns to black and white as the talking picture turns into a silent reel, and you can't help but realize that although film captures life, it also entombs it.  That's pretty heavy, and that's where the action of this film takes place mostly - on an intellectual plane.  There is little to be seen here of the epic struggle between the living and the undead that characterizes most classic vampire flicks.  Willem Dafoe projects glee as Max Schreck.  The original actor who played Count Orlock in Nosferatu is no doubt the most otherworldly inhabitant of any film anywhere, so the idea that he was dug up to play the role makes total sense.

It subverts reality in such a way that we, as the audience, are drawn in until the climax makes us question the lack of veracity in good film making.

It has given me another level on which to enjoy these silent classics.  It has also made me think again of an idea I had recently about resurrecting the silent film as a viable art form again.  An actor such as Eddie Izzard, who is spectacular in this film, is the type of talent that would shine in this sort of medium.  Beyond all this Dan Jones does an excellent job with the score.

Consequently, I was expecting a lot from director E. Elias Merhige's Shadow of the Vampire. What I got was a moody travesty that was preposterous and unexciting. I've always found the topic of German decadence in the 20s an alluring subject, and we do get a feeling of the period from that standpoint. John Malkovich plays the role of F.W.Murnau, the legendary German director of Nosferatu. As always, he is smugly effective. The rest of the cast, though unremarkable, works adequately with the limitations of the material and their roles.  For the most part, the film mopes along to its rather predictable conclusion, with the ghoulish-looking Schreck popping in and out of scenes, doing a few gruesome vampire tricks, speaking in menacing tones and clicking his nails. All the while, Murnau pontificates and bosses everyone around like your average crazy director, while a few nefarious things happen. Murnau furiously admonishes Schreck from harming the cast and crew, but his warnings are unheeded. As a viewer, I was confused about the genuineness of his safety concerns for his coworkers, since at least one person disappears and elicits no reaction from Murnau or the other characters. Admittedly, production values are quite good. Dafoe's makeup is flawlessly fiendish and the opening credits, though long, were eerie and fascinating to watch. Nevertheless, the film just wasn't good enough on most counts to compel me to suspend my belief system, which brings up an inherent problem with subject matter that fictionalizes events based on factual occurrences. It's one thing to build a story with such events, however unlikely, that are at least within the realm of possibility. But when these events are virtually impossible, as is frequently the case in this film, one's credibility can be strained to the breaking point. If that happens, as it did for me, there's a substantial risk the material will be greatly undermined or dismissed entirely. I suspect for the die-hard vampire fans, the film will be generally well received and there are worse horror films around. So with that in mind, Shadow of the Vampire is there if you're interested.

John Malkovich's wig has his hairline receding more in some scenes than others. The title sequence -- easily 10 full minutes of zooming in and out on vaguely creepy artwork while all the people who ever adjusted a light or passed the director a pencil are credited, two at a time -- is a serious test of patience. And there's perhaps a bit too much silliness here and there -- there is the odd cheap laugh.Now the praise Though it would still work if one had not seen Nosferatu, that definitely adds to the experience. Shadow of the Vampire easily matches Nosferatu in giving a sense of Count Orlock (or Orlok; it appears both ways in the title cards) as something completely other.  This count is not a courtly, distorted human. He's utterly, unpredictably alien, and his priorities and needs are entirely his own. It makes him fascinating, and raises all kinds of questions about his real moral culpability. Dafoe is superb.There's no question about the culpability of Murnau in the story; he's rather more dangerous than the vampire. Malkovich, who, with his bored bureaucrat's voice, has a particular genius for making lunacy sound perfectly reasonable, is terrific. And when he and Dafoe are together -- well, there hasn't been so much ham on a single screen since the scene between Charles Laughton and Peter Ustinov in Spartacus. They're a joy to watch.I should also mention to those who haven't seen Nosferatu that, not only is Eddie Izzard a ringer for the pudgy young hero in the original, his portrayal of that actor's approach is not the least bit exaggerated.

Why will an artist reduce himself from a Bunuel to a Tim Burton?The acting makes the film. Dafoe is great as Max Schreck, although perhaps a bit over-acting at times. Malkovich makes a superb german Herr Doktor with a flawless german accent. Udo Kier is as stale and uninspired as always (we love him though).

Once my kids and wife were in bed, and I knew I would not be distracted I turned on my Wii got some snacks and a few drinks. I knew I wanted this to be an experience. The movie loaded, and began to play. I sat at the end of the couch and I can remember the anticipation as the Title Screen rolled. Suddenly, what had felt like a lifetime had passed by and I was still looking at a gray screen listening to some really corny Orchestra music. Confused, I pulled up my time bar and it had only been 3 minutes, but damn I was over it. A recommendation to anyone who has not seen this movie, fast forward 2 mins before you get comfortable. Not letting this diminish my excitement, I opened a bottle of Dr. Pepper and laid back. Immediately, I was sucked into the 1920's. It was super crazy. The opening scene sets the expectation for the rest of the film, and I was suddenly expecting big things. The tone was almost that of a Documentary, but it had incredible characters.You begin to notice the complexity of the story, and you are excited to know how it unfolds. Shadow of the Vampire is about the making of Nosferatu, the very first great Vampire film circa 1922. Leading the production, is Dr. Murnau (John Malkovich) as the films Director who immediately captures an essence of crazy. His only goal is to make the best film which will stand the test of time, and always be the first of it's kind. Taking control of every scene, and constantly changing the story Dr. Murnau is constantly in argument with his Producer Albin Grau (Udo Kier). Albin constantly warns Murnau of how unsatisfied the Backers are, and attempts to add a sense of responsibility to an otherwise irresponsible Director. After some confused travel, the cast and crew arrive on location for the filming of the main character Max Schreck (Willem Dafoe) as the Vampire Count Orlock. You see...complexities!!! Up to this point Max Schreck had never been introduced to anyone aside from Dr. Murnau. It is only known to the cast that Max Schreck is a character actor who prefers to stay in character for the duration of the film. For the duration of the movie, Schreck and Murnau begin what seems to be a strugle for control of the finished product. With flawless performances by Eddie Izzard who plays Gustov von Wagenhein who if you follow along is the main character, and Cary Elwes who plays Fritz Arno Wagner the camera man that helps Murnau bring his masterpiece together, you really do find that this is a spectacular film. I really liked this film. It has made a place in my Top 10, and I will tell everyone I know that they need to watch it. I especially loved the characters, and how each one took the story to the next stage. Also, the attention to detail is amazing. I could totally see this movie going in a different direction at times, but the actors kept it on track. The only dislike I have of this movie I have, is that throughout there seems to be missing pieces. It feels like the whole story isn't being told. I suppose it may have taken quite a bit longer to do so, and for the sake of not boring anyone they kept it simple. I just wanted more I guess, and I suppose that means the writer did their job. I totally recommend this movie. It is a a great addition to other films like Bram Stokers Dracula and Interview With A Vampire. In fact, I could see it on my DVD shelf between those two.

He wasn't, of course, but the ensuing movie has a ball with the premise. Some of the highlights include top-dollar period atmosphere and a never-better turn from Willem Dafoe, playing Schreck with just the right mannerisms. His vampire is sympathetic and repulsive, amusing yet sinister, and it's the kind of performance that helps re-establish Dafoe in my mind as one of Hollywood's greats (what a surprise then that producers don't know how to use him and end up typecasting him as villain for much of the time).Elsewhere, the film supports flamboyant turns from John Malkovich, cult star Udo Kier and Eddie Izzard, sporting the kind of exaggerated German accents that would make an 'ALLO 'ALLO cast member blush. Catherine McCormack (BRAVEHEART) is alluring as one of the leading actresses, and Cary Elwes shows up as an amusingly overblown pilot hero type. Seeing the silent film that inspired this one is a must, of course, and genre fans will probably find much to amuse them here, even if the whole film turns out to be rather minor and forgettable when it comes down to it.

Murnau's 'Nosferatu, eine Symphonie des Grauens (1922),' but my interest in Bram Stoker's chilling vampire tale was rekindled by a recent viewing of Tod Browning's 'Dracula (1931).' E. Elias Merhige is a little-known director among mainstream audiences, probably most recognised for his 'Begotten (1991),' which has developed quite a cult following, owing largely to its lurid plot description. 'Shadow of the Vampire (2000)' was the director's first brush with popular cinema, yet its unconventional approach to history gives it a free-wheeling, independent charm. The film has one of those gimmicky premises that makes you want to watch it immediately director F.W. Murnau (John Malkovich), determined to produce the most realistic horror film ever made, hires the services of a real-life vampire (Willem Dafoe) to play the role of the sinister Count Orlok. Whether the film is able to overcome and expand upon this imaginative plot device is an entirely different story altogether, but at least a single viewing is certainly warranted.There's always something appealing about films concerning the film-making process, particularly when based on a true story. This is basically Merhige's tribute to the legacy of Murnau's most memorable horror film, perhaps the greatest vampire tale ever told, and his passion for the material is clear. However, what ultimately makes 'Shadow of the Vampire' fall short is that it can't seem to decide whether it wants to be a blackly-comedic butchering of history, or the dramatic story of an obsessive film director's descent into madness. It tries both routes, each providing entertainment of sufficient merit, but never fully coming together as a unified picture. Only in the final five minutes does the latter mood take decisive prominence, as the vampire Max Schreck goes on a blood-thirsty rampage of human slaughter, as Murnau emotionlessly and fixatedly continues to crank a camera that has run out of film. This brilliant finale, unspeakably disturbing and hardly comedic, perfectly demonstrates the director's detachment from humanity, and his obsession with capturing these horrifying moments for posterity.Willem Dafoe has received plenty of praise for his portrayal of Schreck, but I think that most of the acclaim should instead be directed towards Ann Buchanan and Amber Sibley for their elaborate make-up work. Withered and sharply-featured, with unnaturally elongated fingernails, this sinister creation is repulsive and grotesque, sometimes comical, but rarely frightening. I thought that the film's standout performance was that of John Malkovich, whose neurotic portrayal superbly demonstrates the director's obsession. Making movies is shown to be Murnau's means of controlling the world. As director, he tells the actors what to do, when to do it, and what to think, and it makes him feel like God. If an event is not captured by the camera, then, for all practical purposes, it never took place &#150; such is cinema's ability to alter reality. Was Schreck really a true vampire, or is this simply Murnau's distorted reality? Of course, all this doesn't explain why the German actor appeared in 33 other films between 1920 and 1936, but I'm not complaining.

Murnau made 'Nosferatu', generally considered to be the best horror movie of its time. Why was it so good? Well, the unlikely answer offered by 'The Shadow of the Vampire' is that Murnau had made a Faustian pact with a real-life vampire to play the part. It's true this conceit has been echoed by a number of contemporary teen-slasher movies, in which plots concern a monster who comes back to haunt the cast of a film being made about him; but without the delightful subtlety on offer here. For what director Elias Merhige has made is a contemporary film about 1920s attempt to make a vampire movie set sometime in the 19th century but staring a man who himself has lived for time beyond counting; and strange blend of the high camp of the Weimar-era film crew (John Malkovich is a natural as Murnau) and the lethal pathos of the vampire (an unrecognisable Willem Defoe). If it reminded me of anything, it was Emir Kusturica's 'Underground', in which a family who spend 40 years in a cellar, sheltering from World War Two, eventually emerge in the middle of the shooting of a war film, and promptly return to hiding; but the conceits of this movie are worked out more consistently, with a story that pushes the ideal of everything for art to its outer limits in a film that is as wry as it is camp.

To me, it was an attempt to capture the atmospherics, the ambiance, and the feel of old-fashioned vampire movies. This movie is an imaginative re-telling of the story of Murnau's Nosferatu. What is Max Schreck were a real vampire and not merely an actor? I will admit that some parts were a bit slow, but that is in keeping with the way the classic vampire movies were made. Enjoy! I could think of worse ways to spend $3 than to rent this DVD. Interesting philosophical questions are raised by the movie who was the real vampire, Schreck or Murnau? Murnau is portrayed as a driven man who ruthlessly exploits his employees. He even manages to be more evil than a real-live blutsauger. On a psychological level, the film works by making one confront the issue how would I, myself, handle a real vampire? He could one exist in a world full of actual vampires? An intriguing question.

It has the notoriety of being banned due to a lawsuit by Bram Stokers estate - the film was made without securing legal rights. There is also a persistent rumour that the star playing the vampire Nosferatu - Max Schreck - was in fact a real vampire. While this no doubt made for good publicity, its just not true. Max Schreck was a notorious perfectionist and a method actor of sorts.The premise of Shadow of the Vampire is that Murnau signed a pact with the devil - a real vampire called Max Schreck - he would star in his picture and behave himself. In return he would be able to feed on the blood of the leading lady once the filming was over. Call this a ridiculous idea, but Shadow stands out on two accounts. The cinematography and recreation of 1920's Czechoslovakia/German is superb as well as beautiful. And Willem Dafo, that highly underrated actor, is a superb vampire. Creepy beyond belief...The major weaknesses are John Malkovich as Murnau, an ordinary performance by an overrated actor and a slow plot. Watch this film for the visuals.

There are some astonishingly eccentric performances (as you would expect) from the likes of Malkovich, Dafoe and Izzard but the story never opens up enough to remain consistently interesting. It's a marvellous idea that Murnau found, in Schreck, a real life vampire to bring a genuine horror to his seminal movie, but the narrative doesn't develop beyond the obvious bemusement of his fellow cast, and the maniac compulsion of an obsessive director aiming to finish his 'masterpiece'. The characters remain largely two-dimensional, and the full horror is never fully exploited, leaving a half-formed horror parody, complete with torch-wielding eastern Europeans and cross-bearing local innkeepers.A film for those who enjoy full blooded performances (although how Cary Elwes ever got an acting job is still a mystery), and have a passing interest in the history of horror.

It is not remotely scary, and hardly even connected to any truth regarding the film. It starts well, copying some shots from the original, but thereafter moves to shots less and less connected with Murnau's original. The inclusion of the word Schweinhund in the dialogue is also unnecessary. As a result of the film's lack of realism, the film is a lot less enjoyable than it could be. There is also very little plot and very little sub-plot the film is utterly based on the Schreck character along with the lead actress, and nothing else, giving it a very 1-D, low-budget feel and no sense of characterisation.

First, let's look at the few positives this movie can boast of.The shadowy elements are incredible.  The movie has a very eerie feel to it, and captures the mood of Nosferatu.  William Defoe and John Malchovisch (sp?) put in Academy Award-deserving performances.  The character-within-a-character approach was magnificiently carried out.  One humorous scene in the movie found Nosferatu being asked his opinion of Dracula...the scene is a classic.  As previously stated, this film had what could be one of the best ideas of any movie..ever...what if the actor playing Nosferatu was actually a vampire, and what if was being played for his acting with the blood of his cast members?Those things being said, the rest of the movie is absolutely horrible. The plot is incoherent and jumps between scenes in such a way that the audience is lost.....*spoilers ahead*...................................................................... ..When the cast and crew start disappearing, why doesn't anybody think that it is strange?  When Shreck bites a costa, does no one think this to be strange? How about when he bites the head off a bat?  Must be normal activities on a movie set.  Hmmm.There suddenly jumps into the movie a pointless nude scene that lasts for quite a while, and also carries hardly an explanation.  The ending of the film is predictable...*spoilers*...having Shreck die the same way Nosferatu did is a waste of time.  Having killed Shreck, Defoe's character (the director) doesn't seem all that fazed by his experiences.Very few times in my life have I come across something that left me with the feeling that I had to take a shower to wash the filth of it off me. The ending of the film involves the lead actress being drugged and sacrificed to Shreck in a way that resembled a snuff film, which one reviewer has already mentioned.Although this film did have Cary Elwes, one of my favorite actors, he sadly enough cannot begin to pull this film out the jaws of the beast of stupidity.

First off, although the conceit that the making of 'Nosferatu' involved the participation of an actual vampire is intriguing, the filmmakers do precious little to exploit or explore the subject.  For the most part, they seem content to play things for laughs, milking humor out of Malkovich's manic portrayal of F.W. Murnau and Dafoe's heavily accented Max Shrek/Count Orlok.A whole host of ideas could have been played with - the fact that Murnau sees film as a beautiful medium for giving immortality to images, contrasted with the horrific curse actual physical immortality has been for Max Shrek. Old world nobility (and superstition) could have been played against new world and 1920s decadence and science.  There is a brief hint from a single line of dialogue uttered by Catherine McCormack about how the camera, a tool of the future, merely takes life from performance, as opposed to live theater, but little is played with this later.Nothing, or close to nothing, is done with any of that.  Especially irksome when you consider how much the real Murnau made 'Nosferatu' a fascinating rumination on nightmares of sexuality, disease, death, and even Western European xenophobia, one that was still stands heads above more popular versions of the vampire myth such as the talkie 'Dracula' with Bela Lugosi.The film also seems to have odd lapses of continuity, hazy motivations and explanations.  What exactly happened to Wolf, the first cinematographer? What is happening to the disappearing cast and crew?  (Presumably, Shrek is eating them one-by-one, but we only watch one such inccident, and no one ever comments on it)  Eddie Izzard's foppish actor Gustav just fades away at some point, never to return.What should have been a climatic revelation scene, in which Malkovich finally fesses up to his colleagues Shrek's true nature, is done so matter-of-factly as to be dull.  And the climax is telegraphed way in advance for anyone familiar with the real 'Nosferatu'.Only Willem Dafoe's performance really kept me consistently entertained. The make-up is absolutely fantastic, in terms of its recreation of the real Shrek's appearance, and as a truely repellant (though not over-the-top) creation.  Dafoe then imbues the design with a variety of gestures - sniffing like a predatory animal, hypnotic gazes, clicking his clawlike fingers - that truly make this vampire feel (ironically) alive and very real.  He also manages one really great dialogue scene, in which Shrek gives his interpretation of Bram Stoker's novel Dracula, expressing the tremendous lonliness of a vampire, while two members of Murnau's crew listen with complete ignorance of the truth, but in also in total awe of what they think is a master method actor at work.'Shadow' is basically a blip in the long history of cinematic vampires.

The plot, therefore, attempts to come across as a horror-crossed-suspense-thriller, a countdown to the vampire's final strike. Director E.

Still, Eisenstein was not a world-renowned filmmaker in '21, major gaffe here. Murnau did not strive for realism as we know the term, he wanted to 'photograph thought'. He was from Marx Reinhardt's school after all, and the man was all about Gesamtkunstwerk. But even going beyond quibbling about details, the movie is problematic.The homage to an era is decent, but we expected all that from just the premise, including all the iconic shots recreated. Whether or not Weimar film crews were fond of doctors' robes, this was really a time when film was thought of as science, something you engineered for the eye and had its own set of laws and gravity, the first and probably last time the effort was seriously undertaken (but mostly in Paris and Moscow).And this reveals the crux of the problem. Back then, they really puzzled about the art, had to, since very little was mapped and what little from centuries of theater. The unique advance of film over theater was placing the maker in control of the eyes of the audience.So we have a filmmaker who makes a film about what it meant in those days to have control over our eyes, to want to photograph thought. He uses the laziest way to get there hoping to do both sendup and essay, the tired trope of a movie about a movie. The two lead roles are so historic in the filmmaking business, he was bound to attract considerable Hollywood talent. He does, two of the most daring.Ideally, he should be able to combine both farcical horror and deeper commentary, stepping off in-film Murnau's key insight that he wants truth, emotional truth of reality. This would be foiled throughout, and preferably by using ambiguously filtered views of looking into a camera.But the sendup is neither sly enough nor particularly clever, for one. A movie set may kill you alright, but most likely through boredom. Instead we get more sellable items for the public, like an actual vampire playing the role, and visionary despot so consumed with posterity he keeps the camera rolling through actual murder. The joke is that there is all the high-minded talk about sacrifice for one's art, plus the sordid actual thing.Now for the part that would involve deeper folds of perception. The story has so little to go off, Dafoe and Malkovich have to go it alone.The two most powerful moments involve each of them projecting into some fictional space, one of them yearning for the sun and getting to see, the other mysteriously enthralled by the rigor of his madness.

Malko and Dafoe can be hilarious. i love the line when the filthy, rat bastard, vampire Schreck is asked by the writer how he became a monster. to which Schreck replies, it was Woman. Hilarious. i love the end scene where Marnau, the writer and the cinematographer plan to trick the filthy rat Schreck only to find he's tricked them. i love it when they scream,he tricked us! he's trapped us in!. it's so fall down funny.this is one of cinema's most beautiful, elegant, and intelligent horror films for adults since Neil Jordan. i wish they could make more of them like this. what a classic.

Shadow of the Vampire is about the making of that motion picture. When I approached this, I was eagerly expecting something not too dissimilar from Tim Burton's Ed Wood; an ironic motion picture about the drama of making a motion picture (and more specifically one in the horror genre). I'm afraid to say that Shadow of the Vampire left me a little flat. This is a very chilling and evocative motion picture (as it should be), and it features Willem Dafoe and John Malkovich at the top of their game. In the end however, their performances sort of go to waste on account of a screenplay which does not give them enough to work with. The final product feels scrappy, inconsistent, highly incomplete, and it comes with a rushed ending which leaves much unexplained.Outside of his title as the greatest German Expressionist filmmaker, I don't know a thing about F.W. Murnau. I was hoping this movie would teach me something...it didn't. It is not because I'm dumb or slow to learn, but rather because the movie never really bothers to take us inside his head. Tim Burton did a great job of putting the viewer inside Edward Wood's mind, and showing us what exactly it was that made him such a moron. At times I was almost sympathetic. The only thing that Shadow of the Vampire makes obvious is that Murnau is nuts.The best scenes in the movie are those between Murnau and his lead Max Schreck as Nosferatu. It is unfortunate that these scenes are too few. The character of Schreck is rather confused I find. He makes no sense, and what is more aggravating is that it feels like director E. Elias Merhige wants it to be that way. His intention to make Shadow of the Vampire as much of a horror film as it is documentation of one works on some level but the story itself (or what little there is) feels hammy and unbelievable.Something that DOES work in the movie, is its appearance. The film is deliberately grainy and desaturated, so as not to look like the product of the 21st century but rather like something that came out of the early twentieth century (in color). Much of the picture feels just as claustrophobic as Nosferatu itself. There are very few wide shots, and a lot of the interiors are tightly framed and dark, lit only with candles or the prop film lights.The ending is a lame pay off. One of the most important details about the production of Nosferatu took place after the films release, regarding the lawsuits from Bram Stoker's widow. It would have been nice to see the film do something with this. Shadow of the Vampire is surprisingly short, I wonder how much material got lost in the editing room.In the end, the film has some things going for it, yet it is a pretty shallow documentation of its subject matter. It definitely not a bad film, but is doesn't satisfy, and it may not actually be worth your time.

Murnau, 1922's Nosferatu, eine Symphonie des Grauens (a.k.a. Nosferatu, a Symphony of Horror), followed by 1979's Nosferatu Phantom der Nacht (a.k.a. Nosferatu the Vampyre), which is considered a remake of the first, I soon watched Shadow of the Vampire, an obvious fictionalization of the making of the classic 1922 film. I'm not sure exactly how high my expectations were beforehand, but after watching it twice, I still can't join the nay-sayers.In 1921, filmmaker F.W. Murnau begins to make his vampire movie, Nosferatu, eine Symphonie des Grauens. He is determined to make the perfect vampire movie, the most realistic one of all time, and will stop at nothing to accomplish this! For the role of Count Orlok, the vampire in the film, Murnau casts the mysterious Max Schreck. Schreck never appears out of character around the rest of the cast and crew, and is never seen during the day! During the filming of Nosferatu, strange things begin to happen! The cast and crew are told that Schreck is a highly talented method actor, but he is actually a real vampire, and Murnau has made a deal with him! The vampire has only agreed to be in the movie in exchange for the neck of the lead actress, Greta Schröder!It's very common for movies based on true stories to be thoroughly inaccurate, but whether you're familiar with what is said to have happened during the filming of Nosferatu or not, I'm sure you can tell by the plot of Shadow of the Vampire that it's an obviously fictionalization (like I said), so when it comes to how accurate this film is, I don't think there's much to get worked up about. I'm not an expert on the filming of Nosferatu, but apparently, some strange things happened during the making of the 1922 classic, and it's a common myth that Schreck was a vampire in real life. However, Shadow of the Vampire is obviously a play on these things.As a film, Shadow of the Vampire is not the most stunning horror piece ever made, with some fairly bland moments, but overall, it is fairly suspenseful, has an occasional laugh (though don't expect a lot of those), and impressive performances from John Malkovich (as F.W. Murnau) and Willem Dafoe (as Max Schreck), enough to make it fairly entertaining. If you watch this contemporary homage to Nosferatu, don't expect an insightful look at the life of F.W. Murnau, Max Schreck, or anyone else involved in the film, but if you're into vampire movies, Shadow of the Vampire just might be worth your time. Just don't expect it to be an absolute masterpiece, like Murnau's groundbreaking silent film.

I -- yes, shudder -- _like_ artsy stuff. I enjoy films others find impossible to endure. And yet, when I ejected the disc of _Shadow of the Vampire_ last night, all I could think was that I had just watched a film that was far too artsy (whatever that means) for its own good ...Or maybe it wasn't artsy enough. A few people have mentioned the wandering accents from some of the actors. I must admit that I wondered as I watched this film come on, do German people speak with German accents when they are speaking German? I mean, I assumed we were to assume the characters were really speaking their own language. To have an English language film about German characters in their own milieu _but with German accents_ feels a bit dunderheaded (Udo Kier, of course, is exempt here). Why any accents at all?My overall opinion is that the film strains hard for effect and fails badly, partly because of the evident strain. Perhaps the ground-level problem is that the basic what if? of the film is essentially a character-based one, a what if? that can really only engage and affect the viewer if the characters involved are three-dimensional or (and here I shudder) realistic. What if you were an actor in a film about vampires and found out that the lead vampire really was a vampire? What if you were an obsessed director who had made a deal with that creature in order to deliver a film? The premise all but demands that the script, production and actors let us get close to these characters, and yet because of the artsiness, the self-consciousness, we are constantly pushed away and know nothing about them, and don't care (well, I didn't) when they die. The actors push hard at times (Malkovich especially) but it feels like Master Thespian-styled ACTING! rather than anything that has its source in the script and the scenes._Shadow of the Vampire_ also suffers because, with the film-about-a-film nature of the project, one can't help but compare the film one is watching with the film it is ostensibly about a comparison in which _Shadow_ suffers._Shadow_ has a wonderful premise, a lot of visual beauty, a couple of very good performances (one can't get away from Willem Dafoe here, and I thought Udo Kier was fine in this film) and ambition. These are all things I admire. I may need to watch this one again, because if nothing else it has made me think. BUT (and this is a big but) I have a hard time getting past a scene where an already-intensely-strange-seeming person grabs a small animal (a bat?), half-eats it or sucks its blood, all while his companions just sort of sit there and stare, then mutter what an actor! They _couldn't_ get up, couldn't scream. The script wouldn't let them. I felt their pain (or thought I did), but I felt the pain of the actors, not the characters.

This movie reminds me of Edward Thomas, a poet who Raymond Williams describes as careening madly between accurate and enlightening observation ('They have taken the gable from the roof of clay/on the long Swede pile') and stupid, clichéd commentary ('Knowledge had come to them as the acorns come to the oaks...') What's best about the conception is the plodding social-realist detail of what working in the film industry was like in 1922. Since old movies come to us like dreams or at least antiques, this engagement with the conditions of production is refreshing and amusing, even if it's made up. The fact that a vampire is on set drinking crew members' blood is treated as a personnel-management issue. Funny! But at the end it gets Symbolic about Art and Truth, with John Malkovich's Murnau descending into dum-dum speechifying. Leaving us with the real, permanent reason to see this film Willem Dafoe, of course, as Mr. Ugly, interpreted not as a Monster but as the ultimate Weird Old Pervert. His facial reaction as Malkovich begs the cast indulgence for his 'unorthodox methods' was worth an Oscar in itself as far as I'm concerned.

Murnau, dir.)To quote Boris Karloff (who's own last great role was Byron Orlok in TARGETS) from The Incredible Doktor Markesan, We will review your testimony - over and over and over again!*****Spoiled reviewer alert It may be necessary to read other comments for insights if my review isn't overly helpful. Question to reviewers of this movie who lamented the lack of Insights into Murnau's life... expecting a full account of his homosexuality... isn't the hint of such things enough?As to reviews complaining that not enough was said in Shadow of the Vampire about the real Murnau, is it the job of the film... to do your homework and roll up everything inside a mini-biopic before the film within the film finally gets underway?To have gone on and on about the historic figures and their other films within this film, would have dragged the story down to pandering or ponderous depths.The 10 minute on and on talk between Malkovich and Dafoe one reviewer found boring... I did not find it at all to be so painfully extended! Did the reviewer watch this film on last year's iPod while waiting at a bus stop during a blizzard (dressed to kill, perhaps)?Dafoe as Max Schreck as Count Orlock as Schreck as the vampire is convoluted and perhaps not even the real villain of the film - he's both wickedly funny and tragic, scarred by old, forgotten wounds. Some say Dafoe's performance was over the top; others called it the best thing about the film. Or claim that Dafoe didn't exactly resemble or do justice to the real Schreck.Among the 30 pages of reviews on this film here, it's not unusual to find one that praises Dafoe as the vampire yet a few sentences later adds that the vampire looked terrible. NO make-up for you! Next!?After several sips of VSOP (half-decent brandy labeled as made in France), I found myself copying some of Dafoe's gestures. He really nailed the uncanny movement of Schreck from the 1922 film.One gesture Dafoe makes, not that I'm aware directly reenacted from Nosferatu, has amusing subtlety... Introduced by Malkovich/Murnau (to his stunned crew getting their 1st look at Schreck), as unconventional, Dafoe waves one hand and shrugs, as if to say yes, so?Some didn't like the German accents (please... if you want a genuine German accent, get a genuine German... or maybe an Austrian). Some found the Malkovich phrasings all wrong, the (Murnau) statements of intention over the top. If they found the film's beginning boring, so did the Murnau characterWhen Murnau shouts, at last an end to artifice, the filming as he intends begins. When he philosophizes on the life beyond life of film, is he being pretentious?Yes, but that's the way German artists in the 1920's expressed themselves... with more zeal than Americans then and now, who tend more to downplay the eternal whatsit of film, so casually consumed like so much popcorn (yet marketed with hard sell that Dr. Goebbels might have appreciated).What about the caution advised for those that see this that haven't seen the 1922 original? I bet many modern viewers (present company excepted) would be bored by the original Murnau, though they might be entertained by Dafoe as Schreck... I doubt whether they would look further. Even if a fan tried to expose them to Nosferatu it would do no good, but who knows? I hope I'm wrong!A scene some found to be a highlight, where Schreck describes the sadness of the book Dracula, makes me want to read those passages to see if Bram Stoker's vampire did indeed suffer the loneliness of one who has forgotten how to select cheese.Comments varied wildly trying to define what type of a picture this even was. I don't think it matters greatly whether it's a horror-spoof, psycho-thriller, costume drama or a what if movie. One reviewer praised it's avoidance of comic relief, all too often found even in otherwise serious horror movies such as The Exorcist and Psycho. Many purists simply put their disbelief on hold and enjoyed the movie for what it is. Good for you. If you have seen this sitting upright with high expectations and were disappointed, and were bored, try watching it again in a very relaxed frame (bed frame). As some have noted, you may see a new detail in the frame previously unnoticed.By the way, I tend to sleep through the opening credits, which some reviewers disliked while others said were the best thing about the film.

In Shadow Of The Vampire, it is insisted that Max Shreck, who became famous for playing the role of Count Orlok, was in fact a real vampire. The director, F.W. Murnau, has made a deal with the real life vampire in which the vampire will star in the vampire role of the film, and in return the director promises him blood, and the sacrifice of his leading actress, Greta Schröder.Sadly, the average moviegoers who are not familiar with Nosferatu, which was made in 1922, will probably not be able to enjoy this movie to the fullest extent. This movie is not filled with violence and killing. Instead, it is shot with beautiful and creepy lighting, terrifying music, and perfect little nods to Nosferatu. I can't think of one reason in the world why any fan of Nosferatu would not enjoy Shadow Of The Vampire, but I can definitely see how people who aren't familiar with Nosferatu will not be able to recognize the things that make this film great.The idea and plot behind this movie is enough to prove that the movie industry needs more people like Steven Katz. The 2000s have been so cliché with all of the rip-offs and remakes, but Katz obviously knows how to think of an original idea and then write a brilliant screenplay based off of it.The acting in this movie is better then what anyone could ever hope for. John Malkovich's portrayal as the obsessed/insane filmmaker is absolutely perfect and remarkable, and I became an official Willem Dafoe fan when I saw him act out the part of Max Schreck AKA Count Orlok. The two of them did so perfect that seeing them act on screen together was nothing less the pure entertainment. The producers of the hit movie Spider Man were so impressed with Dafoe's portrayal of the vampire that they asked him to come in and play the part of the main villain in their film.Another great thing about this film that deserves to be recognized is Willem Dafoe's makeup. Although he doesn't look EXACTLY like Max Schreck did in Nosferatu, Dafoe looks so creepy in this film that it is enough to give you nightmares. He looks almost as scary as the first Count Orlok from Nosferatu... But not quite.Sadly, the director has only made one film since. I hope that he continues to work in the horror genre. He has without a doubt proved that he has great talent and can do a lot for horror movies.In conclusion, Shadow Of The Vampire is an amazing film. Highly recommended.

Oh look, it's John Malkovich talking to a vampire, so you sit up and go wow but ten minutes later when they're still talking you keep glancing at the clock wondering when they're going to do something exciting. This is quite possibly the most boring vampire movie in existence, with Coppolla's wandering, watery 1992 version coming in a close second.  If premises made great films, then The Rocketeer or Arachnopobia or Mars Attacks would all be good films, but premise alone is not enough.  When a film is really good, there are scenes which stay with you for days, but watching Max Shreck is like going down to the retirement home and listening to old man Johnson talk about the 1930s.  Why does Shreck talk like that?  I imagined he would would be poised, refined, elegant, witty, but instead Dafoe gives us a hissing, blubbering, incoherent mess, which any actor in the world can do without trying too hard.  Dafoe's cartoonish, two-dimensional portrayal is much like BB Thornton's cartoonish, two-dimensional performance in Sling Blade; it takes almost no acting skill to stick out one's chin, squint, and speak without moving your jaw.  In his effort to show Shreck as an ancient, damaged wreck, he goes to far to portray him as just another old man.  As the film portrays him, there's nothing particularly memorable or fascinating about Shreck.  I'm sure the real Max Shreck was probably much more interesting than this film implies.

The main theme in this movie is the role of Nosferatu himself (Dafoe) who happen to be some sort of mystic vampire which is hard to control by Murnau himself. Mind you, this is of course not to be mixed up with the real truth but is still a very unique way of filming anyway.

Way flat.  Though I will standingly applaud Willem Dafoe as Max Shreck!  Dafoe is the only reason to waste your time with this film.  But even after 20 minutes of Dafoe it is not enough to keep this film goin.  Next to Kevin Spacey, John Malcovich is America's most brilliant actor.  However here is my theory.  Dangerous Liasons was a great film which actually made Keanu Reeves look good.  So being next to Malcovich can make dung look like pie.  However I think Keanu Reeves sold his soul to the devil to pull off his role in Dangerous Liassons, and the devil thought, Your Soul?, Like Totally Not Narely Enough Dude.  So I think Keanu on the set of Dangerous Liasons begged Malcovich to sell one bad performance to the devil, so Keanu could pull off Liasons.  Malcovich, being a swell guy helped his buddy.     So in this film the Devil gets his due.  Malcovich goes into this role like a roach through a roach motel.  I do not know what happened.  I thought it was impossible for Malcovich to forget how to act.  There you go, you see I can be wrong sometimes.   The other problem with the film is that Max Shreck is a good enough story unto himself, why did this film fictionalise the hell out of the guy.  That is like making a movie about Hitler and making him eat jewish people after they die.  Hitler was evil there is no point in over dramatizing.  Shreck was weird, and a little loopy, why make him eat people and why make the director bargain his cast's lives for a performance by a looney?   Why do films make me ask stupid question.

Pay attention.)","Date":"13 June 2001","Score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama, Horror","Review":"  Making movies about other movies and movie-making is notoriously hard work. Not many have suceeded in making the movie look authentic. Truffaut, Fellini, Wilder, Altman, Cukor and Burton have suceeded. Dennis Hopper and James Ivory failed miserably with The Last Movie and The Wild Party, respectively. E. Elias Merhige makes a bold movie with Shadow Of The Vampire, but the movie doesn't pay off as much as it should've.In 1921, legendary director F.W. Murnau (John Malkovich) set out to adapt Dracula to the silver screen. However, the Stoker estate does not want to give Murnau he rights to the novel. Instead of giving up, Murnau decides to simply change a few things in the storyline. The count is now Count Orlock, and the vampire is now Nosferatu. The cast and crew wonder who the actor playing Orlock is, but Murnau does not want to reveal much. He says the man is Max Schreck, a German actor that he has worked with before. Schreck (Willem Dafoe) demands that all his scenes are to be shot at night. He arrives one night and freaks out the whole crew. Schreck is always in character. He is Nosferatu. The cast become increasingly distressed. They even come to suspect that he is a vampire. After the scene is shot, Schreck bites the cinematographer. He gets progressively weaker and weaker until he is shipped off to the city and dies. A new cinematographer is sent. The cast and crew later find Murnau in a drug-induced haze. He shines new light on the Schreck ordeal. (Of course, I won't tell you what it is.)Director E. Elias Merhige brings a morbid air to this classy production. Not surprising since Merhige's first feature, Begotten, was a 78 minute black-and-white art film that consisted mostly of God cutting himself with a razorblade. (No, I haven't seen it, nor do I intend to) Many reviews pointed out that there was humor in this film. Sure, Defoe gets to deliver a few juicy lines that made me smile, but the movie is hardly funny.John Malkovich played the character with great timing and precision. Although some parts of his role were over-written, with aimless banter to spare, he generally did a good job of covering up the faults in the script. His character is one that is obsessed with making the best picture, the perfect masterpiece. Because of this, we are treated to some dumb scenes. However, the rest of the cast makes up for it, especially Willem Dafoe. Dafoe lights up the screen in a superb performance. In true Method style, Dafoe never appeared out of costume or character during the entire filming. What becomes of this is a surprisingly natural performance, original while still staying true to the original film. In some scenes, actual clips from Nosferatu are inserted, and only by the picture quality can you tell that it changed. Dafoe is that good. The supporting cast is also studded with familiar names such as Udo Kier, Catherine McCormack, Cary Elwes and Eddie Izzard.The biggest problem with Shadow Of The Vampire comes at the very end. Throughout the whole movie you feel as if you're really watching a part of history, thanks to the great performances and visual style. However, all of that is washed clean off once you get the incredibly hackeneyed ending. I can't really reveal it here, however. All I have to say is that this ending breaks any felling of belief you had during the film and also ends the film on a negative note, which to many people makes the movie seem worse than it actually is. I'm sure the screenwriter wanted to make a point, but he should have made it clearer.  For fans of the original movie, Shadow Of The Vampire is a real treat. Not having seen the movie myself, I cannot say that it stayed true to the original. However, Shadow Of The Vampire is entertaining enough to watch without having to worry too much about seeing an 80 year horror movie beforehand. If you are one of the people who do not like a movie if the ending is bad, then stay away. For the rest of us, Shadow Of The Vampire is a slight but entertaining movie. 7/10   "},{"Title":"Truly Awful","Date":"5 June 2001","Score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama, Horror","Review":"  The five minutes that the director spent on filming what appears to be wallpaper in the beginning of this movie, should have tipped me off that it was going to be a pretentious waste of time.

Unbeknown to the rest of the cast and crew, the actor playing the vampire, Max Schreck, is a real vampire, with whom Murnau has struck a bloody and terrible bargain ...Let's get one thing straight - the plot of this movie is baloney. Nobody died during the production of Nosferatu - Eine Symphonie Des Grauens, Max Schreck was an ordinary guy from Berlin who made a lot of movies and died in 1936, and while F.W. Murnau may have been a bit of an obsessive visionary he was not the potty goofball Malkovich portrays him as here. However, if you go with the flow, this film is a lot of fun, particularly the cast. Dafoe is astonishing as Schreck/Orlok, beautifully imitating the mannerisms of the original performance, wide-eyed, stiff-backed, spastic jerking, but also creating a memorably perverse, pathetic and depraved maniac. Malkovich plays the great German auteur as an artist-scientist-philosopher, full of egotistical musings (Our light will play across living faces that laugh and agonise..), Kier is a solid voice of reason (in what other movie could you say that !), Izzard is terrific as the nervously preening Gustav and Elwes has a great part as a drunken, womanising, aviator cameraman. The recreations of various moments from Nosferatu are magically done, particularly when the scene then segues unbroken into the action, and Steven Katz' script is filled with wry moments and intriguing dialogue - I just wish it didn't try to convince me of its authenticity quite so much. This is a good, original movie, but if you haven't seen them already, please check out both the original 1922 Murnau Nosferatu and Werner Herzog's mesmerising 1979 colour remake with Klaus Kinski (which I like even more) - both are astonishing, hypnotic, unmissable horror classics.

After the scenes are shot Murnau & his small crew travel to the small town of Wismar where they prepare to begin filming scenes with Max Schreck (Willem Dafoe) the actor who is to play the part of Count Orlock the Vampire, however there is a great air of mystery surrounding him as none of the cast know of him & Murnau says he lives the character's he play. When he finally makes an appearance Schreck is tall & thin, has long fingernail's, fangs & is completely bald. Schreck also has the unnerving habit of telling everyone that he is a real Vampire which creeps everyone else on set out, the mood doesn't improve when Schreck unexpectedly attacks the cameraman & bites his neck in the middle of a shot...This American, British & Luxembourg production was directed by E. Elias Merhige & I thought it was a really good film that I really enjoyed watching. The script by Steven Katz is a rather fun lighthearted concept that doesn't take itself too seriously & is a fictional idea based upon the filming of the classic 1922 horror film Nosferatu, so basically it's a fictional film based on the filming of a fictional film, got that? Good. The first thing to say is that I don't think it has much historic accuracy which means the filmmakers can have fun here with the supposed myth that actor Schreck was a real Vampire which he obviously wasn't but I think it's a fascinating film to watch, a great idea, something a bit different & a very engaging & entertaining film. The character's are all brilliantly written with great care & attention right down to the lesser ones, the dialogue is good & at less than 90 minutes in length it moves along at a good pace & is never boring. I consider myself a huge horror film fan & as such maybe I'm a wee bit biased about a film which sets itself around the filming of an absolute classic horror film such as Nosferatu but I genuinely liked Shadow of the Vampire as a film in it's own right, I honestly didn't think I would as I thought it was going to be a dull factual biopic but as it turns out it's a throughly charming, watchable & likable film. I didn't think I would but I really liked it.Director Merhige does a fantastic job, the look & feel of the film is brilliant with evocative 20's production design. Shadow of th Vampire could have become bogged down with trying to portray how good Murnau, Schreck & the film Nosferatu itself are & I'm sure that would have made for a very dull time but this has a clear individual story of it's own & thankfully it doesn't seemed to bothered by sticking to every last historic detail.With a supposed budget of about $8,000,000 Shadow of the Vampire has immaculate production values & I love the outfits that the film-crew wear, they end up looking like scientists with their white-coats & dark goggles although I'm not sure why they wore them, apparently it's either because of debris flying from the camera or the fact that they had to light the sets of these really old films so brightly it was almost literally blinding. They both sound false to me... The acting here is top-notch from a great cast including Dafoe, Malkovich, Eddie Izzard, Cary Elwes & the ever fantastic Udo Kier pops up as well.Shadow of the Vampire was on of those unexpected gems, one of those films I thought I was going to hate, I ended up loving it. As with most things in life & cinema I'm sure there will be people who disagree with me & to be fair I could see how someone may not like it but, well, I don't care as I thought it was great. Definitely worth watching, in my opinion anyway.

It is basically a fictionalised version of the making of one of the most influential horror film classics, 1922's Nosferatu ( a Symphony of Horrors), a German play on the Dracula format, made without Bram Stoker's widow's permission. So it sees director F.W. Murnau (John Malkovich) filming all the scenes to his masterpiece, starting with some opening scenes with actor Gustav Von Wangenheim (Eddie Izzard). Then of course the vampire, renamed Orlock, is introduced, in the shape of deep character actor Max Schreck (Oscar nominated Willem Dafoe). As the filming continues, Schreck is so deep into his character that Murnau is getting very frustrated with him, but this may be because (in the twist to the story) Schreck may in fact be a real vampire, which is why he never gets out of character. So you can imagine, slowly as the filming comes to end, and a few people have been killed, Murnau is looking for a way to kill the vampire, both for the film and in reality. Also starring Ace Ventura Pet Detective's Udo Kier as Grau, Cary Elwes as Wagner, Aden Gillett as Galeen, Catherine McCormack as Greta Schröder and Ronan Vibert as Muller. I still may think it could have done with a bit more work, but it still a not-too-bad take on the film-making process of a well-known film, with a twist to it, and some good performances. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Makeup. Okay!

They simply don't realize that there are an equal percentage of bad art films out there as there are mainstream films.  Okay -- that isn't entirely true as mainstream cinema IS at an all-time low.  But this movie stunk up the joint and a lot of people find it brilliant or clever.The film is so misguided. Is it a scary movie?  A dark comedy?  An exploration of a manic film director's obsession?  Because the movie never decides, we the audience are left unfulfilled, because it sure isn't the least bit scary, other than one or two mild chuckles it isn't funny, and worst of all it never gets inside director Murnau's head.The boring film has some extremely overrated acting in it.  Malkovich (not his fault -- the script's fault) never comes to life as a real person, and Dafoe, like Joaquin Phoenix in Gladiator, is being touted for no reason.  Here it's all makeup and the same facial tics.The last of many problems plaguing this film is its deciding to take a real life making of a movie and fictionalizing events that took place.  If you are going to go that route, then really (pun intended) sink your teeth into it and go the distance.  Make it a truly creepy experience if you are going to take artistic license.  Otherwise, I would rather see a documentary that is 100% true of something that has interest.Avoid this one -- a real waste of time and talent. "},{"Title":"No reflection.

The movie takes too long getting started, indicates threads that go nowhere, suffocates any real tension and ends with a pathetic psycho-drama cop-out.It's obviously a director's movie;  E. Elias Merhige uses cinematography in place of storytelling because he knows nothing about the latter.  He seems to have used some diary or anecdote about the making of the original Nosferatu as an eventline (there's no way I would call it a storyline.)  Any humor is strictly accidental and takes too long to tell.  It flogs to death its metaphor of the artist-possessed-by-his-demons-for-his-art cliche.About the best that can be said about this movie are John Malkovich playing director F.W. Murnau, and Willem Dafoe completely believable in his make-up and accent as Max Schreck;  he chomps at the bit to fly with this role but chafes at the frustration.  They both deserve better than this;  so did the movie.

There seriously was not one redeamable quality in this film. I could care less about the characters, the message, the story line or the dialogue. This was a dark, BORING movie. There was nothing striking about it, and they literally just threw in the towel at the end and saidLets get this over with. that is what the ending felt like. I Marvel at how some low budget independent films get so much recognition simply because they're trying to be different. This movie sucked, plain and simple, and I'm not a simpleton. I'm a screenwriter and I love a variety of genres. I had HIGH expectations based on who was in this film and the premise. I walked out thanking the lord that the film was only 90 minutes.....the longest 90 minutes of my life. I am a HUGE Dafoe fan and I can honestly say that his performance is not only overhyped, but that I would vote for all four other best supporting actor nominees over him, and I was not high on Alber Finney or Jeff Bridges at all. I was hoping Dafoe's performance was going to shine above the others, but it just didn't happen. There was nothing wrong with his acting, but ther was nothing oscar worthy about his character. And for a movie that is supposed to be dark and funny, it simply was dark. I did not laugh once. No one in the theater did. A few walked out, and there was only a handful present. Do not see this film. It is the worst movie I have seen all year, and I've basically seen EVERYTHING.

Infuriating drama from screenwriter Steven Katz comes on like an atmospheric biography--but somewhere along the way turns into a flamboyant fictionalization complete with horror-movie overtones of its own. The opening moments are certainly intriguing (after the ridiculously prolonged credits sequence), but--between Malkovich's egomaniacal artist and Dafoe's unyielding thespian-monster--interest in the characters on-screen as real people dissipates. Director E. Elias Merhige was obviously going for something heady and unusual here, not the typical by-the-books factual account. Still, the morphine-induced, bloodsucking chaos which erupts isn't appealing even on a darkly comic level, and the picture doesn't come to a legitimate conclusion so much as it does stop dead in its tracks. *1/2 from **** "},{"Title":"Weak, Alleged, and VERY SILLY !","Date":"11 May 2010","Score":"0 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama, Horror","Review":" Oh my god. This is one very silly movie, because as a drama it assumes many events that doesn't rationalize, or even establish by special imaginary logic; as if all the crow were whether so dumb to believe that the lead actor is very devoted (to the extent of eating bats at night !), or simply all drugged ! The proofs that the lead is a vampire are countless  he sucked the blood of the lead actress at the end, he died out of a daylight's beam, the gift of the director was a bottle of blood, &#x85;and yeah, his reflection on the mirror at the end for a second was a mistake done by the director or the editor which was left maybe to make us live this absurd confusion !Let alone the movie's bragging by making up all of this imagination in known history; (F.W. Murnau) lives after (Nosferatu &#x96; 1922), directs 10 more movies, then dies in an automobile accident in 1931, (Max Schreck) is a previous theatrical actor and a next movie star who dies from a heart attack in1936 &#x85;etc. Hence, if (Schreck) died right after (Nosferatu), or anything mysteries already happened during shooting it, that would have left a magical space in which any writer can play freely. Originally connecting (Shadow of The Vampire) with another, too known, older movie is the peak of weakness. Why this script didn't build its own legend instead of narrating hidden sides of real characters and events that by superficial comparison to their reality all what (Shadow..) presents, about them, will seem so idiot !It's not a fictional dealing with true characters for the sake of retelling their story, a la for instance (The Brothers Grimm &#x96; 2005), or a re-gathering of imaginary characters to tell a new story, like (The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen &#x96; 2003). It's maybe a little bit of both; fictional dealing with true characters for the sake of telling a new story, however the outcome can't be more manipulated. It begs the attraction by dealing with real characters, I though it might do very well away from them, to be a real story of fake movie, not the *fake* story of real one; that at least could have made it more independent and less foolish !To add more fuel; it lacks the enjoyment, being a truly naive horror. In fact the movie's only success was in showing Dracula as a monster for a new Dr. Frankenstein (calling the director, played by John Malkovich, doctor for all the time wasn't meaningless or for granted). So when that director got rid of his humanity by putting a higher aim than any human sacrifice, he became crazy and killer. It's Dr. Frankenstein and his monster again yet in a different treatment this movie has all the credit for. However, the plot itself wasn't as creative. The movie looks born from a joke around how realistic (Max Schreck) was as a vampire. The problem though is that the whole thing was only an embodying of this joke! Now, this joke caused nobody's laughing, or interest. And the movie ended up eventually as weak, alleged, and very SILLY !

Murnau. In the film, Murnau thinks he has found the perfect actor to play the lead role but soon he begins to think that Max Shreck (Willem Dafoe) is a real vampire. I've heard about this movie ever since it came out but only now got to it. I must say that while watching the thing I couldn't help but feel it was slightly overrated but at the same time the movie is certainly unlike any other docu-drama out there. Unlike ED WOOD and GODS AND MONSTERS, this film here deals with nothing but fiction so I was curious as to what the whole point was of the movie. You'd think that it was just a spoof but that's not true because a lot of the film plays the subject matter rather straight, although I have to think that somewhere this was just meant to be a fun picture. There are many impressive things here including the overall look of the film, which manages to really get your into the making of the original film with some incredible looking sets and costumes. Another major plus is that scenes from the original film are perfectly blended in with the new footage and it's rather uncanny how great they mix together and I'm sure many people won't be able to tell the different between the two. It was rather fun seeing Murnau directing various famous scenes of the movie even though everything being said probably didn't happen. As far as the performances go, they are for the most part very impressive. Malkovich is pretty laid back in the role of Murnau but he doesn't manage to shine in the scenes where he's begging his actor not to kill members of the film. The entire film clearly belongs to Dafoe who does a wonderful job and certainly deserved his Oscar nomination. What I loved most is that Dafoe captured the silent acting during the scenes outside the making of the original film. Just watch the sequence on the ship when he kills a man and it's pretty haunting at how close Dafoe captures the acting that would have been done back in the 20s. Cary Elwes, Eddie Izzard and Udo Kier round out the cast. Again, I'm really not sure what the point of this movie was but for the most part it's entertaining. They say all docu-dramas need fiction in order to be entertaining from start to finish but here's one without any truths and it's certainly different than anything we've seen before.

W. Murnau made his classic NOSFERATU (1922). However, a little way into the movie, it became apparent that the writers took some creative license with the true story. Then, a little bit later, it was obvious the whole film was a put-on. While it was pretty entertaining and a lot of fun to watch, in hindsight, I really wish the film had been the true story of the making of NOSFERATU--or even better, the true story of Murnau's very, very unusual life. For Cinephiles like myself, I was hoping for these true-life insights, but I assume the average person probably could care less about Murnau and just wants to see the film for its entertainment value--and it does provide a good bang for the buck. And, in the end, it is a scary and truly bizarre film.The star of the film is undoubtedly Willem Defoe. His strange way of pursuing other roles and the parts he chose in other movies make him a good choice to play Orlock. Aside from this, the production values and all are very good, though parents might want to think twice about having the kids watch the film, as there is a bit of nudity in it here and there.If you are inclined, try to learn about the REAL Murnau. He was a very tragic figure in film history--being gay in pre-Nazi Germany and dying at such an extremely young age--at the height of his brilliant career. Plus, if possible, seek out his movies--not just NOSFERATU. His FAUST and THE LAST LAUGH (among others) are brilliantly composed and filmed movies. "},{"Title":"Yes Dafoe was brilliant...

I'm well aware that people usually writing reviews on this site are teenage pretentious would-be film critics, but some of the reviews fall so far from the mark when writing about 'Shadow of the Vampire' that it's a bit ridiculous. People have been writing about what a scary character Schreck (Dafoe) is and how powerful he is, and how Murnau (Malkovich) wasn't strong enough to fight him. You are missing the entire point of the film. Vampire films as a rule, depict vampires as the big scary monsters. Its obvious and a stereotype of the sub-genre. But, you people are forgetting that 'Shadow of the Vampire' is a hybrid film, and it DOESN'T follow the typical format of a vampire film. Instead it follows the format of a psycho-thriller. (For all the people who have written that Murnau (Malkovich) waffled too much about film-making and was a bit pointless - Duh?!?) Yes, Dafoe was brilliant. Yes Dafoe was repulsive visually. But Dafoe's character is NOT the bad guy of the film. Malkovich's is. Schreck (Dafoe) killed people from a basic need to feed. Murnau (Malkovich)'s only problem with this is that he needs the people to make his film. He got Schreck to participate in the film by offering him the leading lady. Schreck is lonely and shows vulnerable sides to his character in the scene where he talks to the producer and screenwriter about the book Dracula. Murnau is so high off laudanum (an alcoholic extract of opium) and his own self importance that he doesn't care that Schreck kills, as long as it doesn't interfere with his picture. - The reason that Murnau rants on about film-making is to show that he's a pretentious and up-his-own-backside selfish t**t. The scariest part of the film is at the end where Schreck kills Greta (the leading lady), the photographer and the screen writer and Murnau just stands there, emotionless and films it.
