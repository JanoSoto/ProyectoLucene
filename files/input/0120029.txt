Harland Williams is a genius.  C'mon all you Chinese.....  Who comes up with this stuff???  I got the feeling that the directors and writers just told Williams to work around the script and improvise whatever he wanted?  Some of this stuff is so off the wall, you wonder just how much was scripted. And this is not your typical Jerry Lewis slapstick. Williams has a great deal of pure talent.  Anyway watch it and just enjoy the wonderful absurdity that is Rocket Man.

I base a good comedy on how many times it makes you laugh - this movie made me laugh so hard I cried at least 3 times. It throws tons of jokes at you - Harland Williams is great as the computer specialist who gets his dream job of becoming an astronaut -- what I'll do now is use what we like to call 'The right way to show you how it's done. There was only one moment where one joke goes on a few seconds too long (whole world in his hands bit) - but other than that it a very inventive comedy that will make adults laugh just as much as the kids, maybe more.

It's definately the funniest Disney film i've ever seen, though, while being great slapstick comedy with excellent delivery by Harland Williams, it also gets in the morals & ideals rife in Disney films.  This is unique in that it's the only film i know of that i could have watched with 10 yearolds while not being ashamed, and also watch with some buds with a few beers. It's great & unique in that way  Harland Williams carries this film, which is understanding as it is a vehicle for him, but the supporting cast is also excellent and the film was great for me.  Since there is constant association with the ground team, you don't get the boxed in effect that you find in many travelling films, e.g. Speed, Speed 2 & the film never slows down for me.  The best bits to watch for are the machine that spins Williams round & the bitchin' Mr Magoo impression.

The natural innocence and ignorance (also a touch of genius) Harland Williams has shown in his character was simply superb. The movie has tons of jokes thrown at you and you simply cannot resist them. You have to be a little patient at the start of the movie. The reason for this is after seeing Harland william's Charlie Chaplin type acts at the start, you think it is going to be just another comedy movie. But then, when he gets a chance to be an astronaut you get a felling of taken inside the movie without your consciousness. The monkey and Harland Williams seat interchange inside the rocket and what all happens after that till the rocket lands is the ultimate comedy to relish. The climax too was a nerve wracking finish. It takes you to the edge of the seat when Harland just gets it right in taking the rocket back to the track thus avoiding a crash. The best thing is what he uses to fill in the gap for a missing wire. On a whole till date this is the Best Comedy movie i have ever seen in my life.

Randall starts training at NASA with a chimp. Bud Nesbitt is nominally blamed for Apollo 13.The premise is stupid. Harland borders between annoying and somewhat likable. Most of the jokes don't work. It could be a lot worst. Harland has his moments. Most importantly, he's not mean-spirited. He does a lot of slapstick. The problem is that he can't help himself.

We have seen his situation in countless films where the little guy must prove himself. Well, he fails to prove anything other than he has too much time on his hands. Jessica Lundy is featured as the love interest who must be proud to be caught on camera with a moron astronaut. Also featured much to their regret are Beau Bridges and William Sadler, and one wonders if they will regret it later or laugh it off as a bad joke. Either way it is a big bad rocket blast fart that will stench up their resumes until something decent comes up to distract from it.

This movie reopened some old wounds of annoyance and irritation that I thought I had long since recovered from. Surely this movie has the potential, if not the capability of destroying the developing brain cells of any child that was forced to watch this movie more than a couple of times.(And this is a proclamation coming from someone who grew up watching mind wrecking shows like Ren and Stimpy, and Beavis and Butt-Head). The only solace I had after re-watching this garbage after 17 years, is that I know that the main character(I forget his name and thank God for that) dies on the return trip home. Because he doesn't have nearly enough food to last the eight month trip back to earth, since he idiotically used it all as paint.

Randall, and one day his luck changes when he's offered the position of a third astronaut on a Space Shuttle Mission to Mars! IMO, that's a HECK of a lot more interesting than any of the overrated dumb 'comedy' films.When on Mars, the comedy doesn't stop there!In the end, this film doesn't treat you like an idiot, our main protagonist actually matures (unlike other dumb character), it had humor that WORKED, this film has EFFORT, and really convincing landscape for Mars.PS This film ought to switch its 5.9 rating around with Dr. Strangelove's 8.5, or with Dumb & Dumber's 7.3 - I'm serious, it's THAT good!Hey, it's frickin' Disney!

It's a Disney movie so it's got all the rough edges smoothed down, the level of 'offensive' has been completely focus group polished out of it. The closest we get is one of the movies flattest jokes about flatulence in space. Despite this, it has aged very well and remains one of the absolute best quotable funny movies ever made.This is chiefly due to the charisma of the lead character, a Poindexter computer scientist cum everyman who somehow manages to not only become an astronaut candidate but also ends up on a flight mission to Mars.Parts of this were filmed at Johnson Space Center and for the time is reasonably realistic to the look and work. I've got a friend who was an uncredited extra in this and according to him they used a lot of NASA engineers as extras too. If you like slapstick and absurd comedy it is hard to do better than this, and the bonus is you can watch it with your kids. Highly recommended for fans of off kilter absurdness. There are some low points, such as the pointless (yet still funny) shoehorned romance, and the complete waste of Beau Bridges and William Sadler who both play it straight. This is not an ensemble movie, it is nearly completely driven by the comedy timing and dialog of Harland Williams. This movie desperately needs the full BluRay treatment with commentary from all the principles.

I put two other movies along side this one in this category - Down Periscope, with Kelsey Grammar and, once again, Harland Williams, and Bushwacked with Daniel Stern (City Slickers). These 3 movies are simply hilarious and are excellent selections to play for others, since they probably haven't seen them, and they're perfect for playing when families are over, because the kids and the adults all enjoy them.Harland Williams is a phenomenal actor and is a perfect fit for his role in this movie - his only starring role in a movie, I believe. It's such a shame that he hasn't starred in more movies and that he's been in so many duds. It seems like he has become a solid bit-part actor, which is such a waste of his talent. He was excellent in Down Periscope, where he made sounds like a whale. His facial expressions and ability to make odd sounds are simply amazing.Rocketman has a superb cast and many memorable parts and lines. I especially like the opening segment where Kelsey Grammar is teeing off, and the fart segment, which I know is the tried and true crude humor attempt, but it just works - even better than the famous fart segment of The Nutty Professor! The love story is very nice and the Wish Upon a Star song is a real Disney moment. This is an excellent family Great film!

I've always felt that 'Rocketman' was one of Disney's best and most under-appreciated live-action films of the last thirty years. It has so many elements of the traditional formula that makes it so Disney, as a die-hard fan, I find it hard to resist.This film is a homage to so much of what Disney loved. It really is a reference to the innovative 'Man in Space' series from the 1950's 'Wonderful World of Disney', and from movies like Disney's 60's comedy 'Moon Pilot'. Not to mention the references to Pinocchio.Harland Williams is not exactly the type of comedian you would expect to see in a family comedy, but then again, neither is Eddie Murphy or even, say Buddy Hackett, for that matter. All of those comics have a pretty raunchy sense of humour outside of their Disney films. I've seen William's stand up humour outside of 'Rocketman', and it is pretty vulgar and college. In this Disney film it is completely wholesome and harmless with perhaps the exception of a scene that features drunkenness.The only thing that may possibly offend is the reference to evolution at the expense of Michelangelo and the Vatican ceiling. But hey. Disney himself was a devout Christian who didn't bother to question science. Very few people did in the 50's. Ever been to a Disney park and seen the different stages of man in evolution? I have. Seen 'Spaceship Earth'? I have. Need I go on? I bet you wish I wouldn't. Look it's not our fault yall wanna start all over again.This might just well prove to be the funniest if not the most controversial film experience of the twentieth century next to '2001 A Space Odyssey'.

Roger Ebert enjoyed the film, giving it a 3 star evaluation and labeling it as APOLLO 13's evil twin. The first 50 minutes of the film contain many pricelessly funny scenes that you probably won't see again in other comedies. However, the film almost immediately runs out of steam when it reaches its middle despite some gags that work occasionally.Canadian comedian Harland Williams delivers a memorable performance as Fred Z. Randall, a highly eccentric computer nerd who finds himself chosen on the first manned Mars mission after causing an amusing accident on a visiting NASA astronaut in his office. He drives his serious fellow astronauts and faculty members nearly insane with his slapstick antics and clumsy behavior once he arrives at NASA, always claiming after an accident, It wasn't me! Among my favorite gags in these scenes include Fred's chance meeting with a troublesome chimpanzee named Ulysses, Fred's experiences in an isolation chamber and on a centrifuge, and his behavior at a NASA press convention. And there are plenty of inspired gags once Fred and his fellow crew members enter the vast depths of outer space, some which even break the laws of physics. Special mention should go to the other actors in the film, all of which give competent performances William Sadler as Fred's cranky superior astronaut, Jeffrey DuMunn as the serious Lead Flight Director of NASA, and Beau Bridges as a compassionate Mission Control member.However, once the film reaches its first 50 minutes, it's as though the imaginative writers ran out of good gags and therefore the film falls limp despite some sparks of good gags until the end. This problem plagues most comedies&#151;including my personal favorite comedy, PEE-WEE'S BIG ADVENTURE (1985)&#151;and it's too bad that Disney didn't produce this as a short film instead. Yet I can't deny Williams' impressive talents for improvisation, mimicry, slapstick, and bizarre facial expressions that make the film well worth watching.Although kids may enjoy the slapstick antics and adults may enjoy the clever lines, the film is best enjoyed if you appreciate silly, quirky visual humor that is reminiscent of Looney Tunes cartoons, skits performed by Mr. Bean (Rowan Atkinson), and/or Charlie Chaplin comedies. For those with humor of a different sense&#151;including those who indulge in continuous verbal humor or continuous sophomoric humor&#151;I suggest that you look elsewhere.

The astronauts training for a Mars mission encounter a problem which was apparently caused by the software Fred wrote.After an accident, one astronaut is out of the Mars program, leaving only Gordon as the mission's computer specialist. A backup must be chosen, just in case. Guess who gets the job? Fred will room with Ulysses the chimp, whose trainer Julie has doubts about him. While Fred and Ulysses destroy her lab behind them, Paul explains to Julie that 'The kid's our only hope.' Fred's mother is worried about Fred going so far from home, but Fred explains that he is 30 and 'nearly a full-grown man.' Fred does surprisingly well in training, though Bill, the mission commander, thinks he is 'an embarrassment to NASA'.The day finally comes for the selection of the team for the Mars mission. Ben Stevens looks distressed as he tells the press.On the way to Mars, Fred continues to cause chaos as he did on Earth. ('Are we there yet?' 'Can I drive?' 'I'm hungry.') Tubes containing food look a lot like tubes for hemorrhoid cream, laxatives, and toothpaste. On TV, however, Fred attempts to bring the world together by singing 'He's Got the Whole World in His Hands' in different languages, though of course he uses the words he knows from those languages, as stock footage from various cultures (even African tribes) suggests that the whole world is watching this mission, even though no one seems to be near a TV.The astronauts are supposed to sleep for eight months, but Ulysses locks Fred out of the pod he was to sleep in, and Fred can't fit in the one intended for Ulysses. So Fred has to keep his mind occupied for eight months. You can imagine how the spaceship looks--though the new version of Michelangelo's 'The Creation of Adam', revised to include Ulysses and Julie, is an impressive piece of work.Wouldn't someone have noticed he was awake, though? Not a problem; Fred has rigged the monitoring equipment so no one will know. Except Bud, who realized there was a problem with the Apollo 13 mission but was afraid to tell anyone. Fred has discovered a problem that could affect this mission in much the same way, but Bud will have to keep his secret because Fred could get in trouble if anyone finds out he was awake. Eventually, the crew realizes it was a good idea to have Fred on board. The ending is very exciting.Harland Williams is very funny, a cross between Steve Urkel of 'Family Matters' and Kirk of 'Gilmore Girls'. If you like Urkel's antics and don't care about scientific accuracy, this is a really good movie, with lots of comedy, physical and otherwise. There's nothing really to concern parents, except for some mild bathroom humor. If you don't mind your kids seeing flatulence jokes, this is a good family film.

Unfortunately, this movie neither funny nor inspiring.  Harland Williams is miscast (he was excellent in other movies), and little in the movie makes much sense.  For a film like this to work the hero needs to have redeeming traits, but the Randall character is always trying to blame mishaps on others.  So it is not a good film for children either.

However it is most  definitely enjoyable. Normally slapstick is not my favorite type of comedy, but it  seems to work really well especially in the severity of the many situations the  crew of The Pilgrim (the first manned mission to Mars) finds themselves in. The Pilgrim's crew is not your standard NASA crew to space. Well two membersof the crew are, the third member of the crew computer geek Fred Randall(Harland Williams) found his way on to the crew by only knowledge of thecomputer system, and the only man not to be injured during astronaut training.  The fourth member is a chimpanzee named Ulysses (Raven), who starts a chainof events (beginning with getting into the wrong suspended animation chamber) that gets Fred into to trouble with the jealous and high-strung CommanderOverbeck (William Sadler), and making him look rather stupid in front of hiscrush Julie Ford (Jessica Lundy).Despite Fred's antics, and mishaps the mission and movie ends well, as Fredsays It's tale as old as time Ulysses. Boy meets girl, boy falls for girl. Boy and  girl return to home planet, get a nice little house with a white picket fence.

I loathed every second of it. The only reason why I'm writing anymore about this about this abortion is that IMDb wants at least 10 lines for a review. While watching Rocketman I was actually concerned my girlfriend would leave me. Anybody associated with this film should be exiled (if not shot). There is almost nothing redeeming about this film. The only part that was remotely enjoyable was Harland Williams losing it over gefilte fish space paste. Also, the movie ends with the unfunny protagonist getting up in the love interest through dancing upside down (because of artificial gravity). I'm nauseous.

Typically, he's a fine straight man, but sometimes, his dry wit shows through. In Rocketman, however, he has allowed himself to be reduced to sophomoric antics worthy of any SNL reject (and I say that with all due respect) and appears to belong in a Rob Schneider movie.Quite frankly, this was too painful to watch. The character wasn't funny. He was pathetically moronic...sad...not funny. This has been heralded as awesome, and hilarious, but neither is this funny, nor is it awe inspiring. It's just stupid, with no redeeming qualities whatsoever.I was not entertained, nor was I amused with this film.It rates a a 1.2/10 from...the Fiend .

William Sadler was great as The Grim Reaper in Bill And Ted's 2nd movie, so can be forgiven for this!.....But having heard great things I decided to watch it on British TV. Now apart from the odd piece of bathroom humour there was nothing really to laugh at that had not been attempted before! There are 6 full pages of positive testaments to this film, so I don't expect this to be a popular decision, but I've awarded one point for awful for the first time ever on IMDb.Someone actually compared this movie to What About Bob....Blasphemy! If you feel guilty about anything in life you could always watch this film for Lent.

It looks like a movie  it has actors, and dialogue, and lights and makeup and clothes, but something is really missing from this thing.  Harland Williams's only saving grace is that he is slightly less irritating than Pauly Shore, which really isn't saying much if you've seen Bio Dome.This movie is strictly for children.

You can make perfectly good children's movies that people over the age of six can watch, too, you know. Just look at The Neverending Story, or several of Disney's productions. This movie just does everything wrong. Instead of doing good humor, they settle for some cheap slapstick comedy, coupled with gross-out comedy, and to add that final flavor of crap, some childish comedy. The main character is in no way likable, not even the least bit; he's annoying, a jerk, a retard, he has the social skills of an infant and worst of all, he keeps destroying things beyond repair, only to blame it on someone else(on a similar note; am I the only one who thinks that it wasn't me is ripped from Steve Urkel's did I do that? or Bart Simpson's I didn't do it? Lastly, both of those catchphrases are far superior and much more entertaining than the one from this lame movie). The 'love' story is unlikely and obviously just thrown in to take up screen-time and to not disappoint that little group of emotionally disturbed people who can't watch a movie that doesn't end with the unlikely hero winning the girl, no matter how ludicrous a case it is. The plot is about as nonsensical as they come, and is merely put together to allow for plenty of painfully unfunny comedy scenes. The characters are clichés. The acting is so far below average that it's ridiculous. Everything about this movie is lame and unfunny. Pity, too, because Dumb and Dumber proved that Harland Williams can be funny, if only mildly. In this he's just juvenile and annoying. I wouldn't even recommend this to kids, as it's simply so bad. The special effects look hideous, too, and are really directly embarrassing to professional movie-making. This could have been made in the 60's, and it would have looked better. The humor is childish and lame, there wasn't one single moment throughout the runtime where I as much as smiled at a joke or gag. The jokes and gags are forced and try way too hard to be funny, and just end up looking embarrassing to the cast and the filmmakers, who, surely, can do better than this pitiful waste of time and energy. The runtime is barely 90 minutes, yet it's incredibly hard to sit through. I urge you, please, avoid this like the plague. It's more bad than you can possibly believe. I recommend this to no one, not even kids; well, actually, if you're a parent and you need your kid to leave you alone for about 90 minutes, put this on, and just avoid even catching a glimpse of it. That's the only possible use I can come up with for this unbelievably bad movie. If you do have it, if you rented it on VHS or DVD, I only have one suggestion(apart from the above mentioned one and of course returning it as soon as humanly possible); fast-forward about 45 minutes into the film, where there is played a good, old-fashioned rock song, something 60's or 70's, I'd guess. That's the one redeeming quality of this film, and it's not even enough to bring the rating up from the lowest score of one. 1/10  "}]
