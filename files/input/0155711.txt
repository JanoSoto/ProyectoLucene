The movie is about an ex homophobic cop who suffers a stroke while trying to save a girl , who happens to be a friend of his gay transvestite neighbour , during a run in with some drug dealers. His doctor tells him the best way to improve his speech is to start singing lessons. He plucks up courage to ask his neigbour to teach him to sing. This film is about how the relationship grows between these two very different people and how they both work together to overcome their very different problems. De Niro is back to his best after some very average movies and the acting from Phillip Seymour Hoffman is just outstanding. I have seen Hoffman in other films such as Boogie Nights and Magnolia and was impressed then but this is his best to date. I love this film and i think you will to. Dont miss it.

In an effort to regain some of his speech capabilities it is recommended to him that he take singing lessons.  So he decides to ask his neighbor Rusty (Philip Seymour Hoffman), who is a female impersonator, to give him singing lessons.  This is an unlikely pairing because Walter is a belligerent homophobe.This film was written and directed by Joel Schumacher.  His story, though peculiar, makes some powerful points.  This is a story about hatred, bigotry and reconciliation.  Walter learns through his disability who his friends really are, and who they are not.  It seems that the people he hates treat him a lot better than the people he thought he loved.  Ultimately, he is able to look past his prejudices to find the human elements that make him and Rusty not so different after all.This was an excellent character study of both main characters, giving a lot of insight into the motivations and lives of each.  Unfortunately, the story meanders too often to irrelevant characters and scenes that don't really contribute much (like the Gay Republicans).  Schumacher would have been better to concentrate on the relationship between Walter and Rusty rather than digressing so frequently into Rusty's relationships with his friends.De Niro was outstanding in this film.  Not only was he excellent in the emotional portrayal of a man having to deal with a sudden debilitating stroke, but he was very realistic in his portrayal of the physical disability itself.  The combination of his struggles to do the simplest of tasks and the obvious look of anguish and frustration on his face was poignant and affecting.Hoffman brought a lot of emotional energy to his part, and his imitation of a drag queen was passable, though somewhat forced and unnatural.  Wilson Jermaine Heredia, who played Cha-Cha, the winner of the Flawless contest, was a much more convincing queen.I rated this film a 7/10.  This is a good film that helps us understand that the remedy for the fear wrought of our differences is understanding, not hatred.  In that respect it makes an important contribution.  If cross dressing and blatantly gay themes put you off, perhaps you should defy your inclinations and see it.

There were certainly stereotypes among the minor characters but the plot was good and so was the acting.  My acting teacher used to describe plays/films like Virginia Wolff as love stories.

Walter Koontz (Robert De Niro) is paralyzed on his right side, his speech is impaired and he can barely walk; to overcome his speech difficulties, he is encouraged by his doctor to try singing lessons, which in some cases like his have proved effective.  Toward that end, he hires Rusty Zimmerman (Philip Seymour Hoffman), a neighbor in his apartment building, who performs at a local club in town.  Formerly at odds with one another, the two form an alliance for their mutual benefit; Walter needs help, and Rusty needs the money. 	De Niro, as always, turns in an outstanding performance here, so physically convincing and shading Walter's disability with such finesse, that you forget that this is an actor playing a role.  Such is the magic De Niro can weave on the screen.  Hoffman, too, is excellent as Rusty, the tortured soul who wouldn't wish his life on anyone, and who can readily identify with Walter's newly acquired sense of isolation and helplessness.  He understands self-pity and tries to help Walter get past his own.  There is nuance to his performance through which he conveys so well Rusty's subtle anxieties and the feeling of rancor that surrounds him, and with which he must live every day of his life.  Also notable in a supporting role is Skipp Sudduth as Walter's friend, Tommy, who must deal with his own confusion in dealing with Walter's situation, and the people with whom he now finds him involved.  Previous to the stroke, drag queens were definitely not a part of their immediate circle of friends. 	The supporting cast includes Barry Miller (Leonard), Christopher Bauer (Jacko), Daphne Rubin-Vega (Tia) and Karina Arrovave (Amber).  Schumacher has deftly crafted a character study that examines diversity and proffers the rewards of a symbiotic existence.  The message here is that no one is flawless; we're imperfect creatures living together in an imperfect world, and if we can only get beyond ourselves and our prejudices, we just may find that gold at the end of the rainbow.  `Flawless' is not without it's own flaws, either; some of the scenes involving the other drag queens and some of the criminal elements involved are somewhat overplayed at times, but that's a minor complaint.  This film is deeply felt without being sentimental, and sheds some light on the human condition.  It holds up a mirror to all of us, and asks the flawless among us to step forward.  I rate this one 7/10.

But very few want to talk about the social implications of it.Philip Seymour Hoffman is a female impersonator who lives in the same apartment building as Robert DeNiro, a retired policeman who works as a security guard. During a robbery of a drug dealer, one of Hoffman's fellow drag performers is killed and DeNiro suffers a stroke trying to prevent the crime. The drug dealers can't exactly go to the police with their story, but they have other methods of dealing with transgressors.DeNiro and Hoffman have nothing in common at all and usually confine any conversations they have with some usual shouted epithets. But DeNiro's doctor advises singing lessons as a form of speech therapy and he goes to Hoffman. They develop an unusual friendship.More unusual because it turns out that Hoffman has the stolen loot. And why Hoffman is keeping it is a matter of life and quality thereof.Hoffman is not dressing in drag for effect or to make money as a performer. Hoffman's real drag is the body parts God gave him because they don't match what's inside. Hoffman is a transgendered soul and the cost of a sex change operation is more than he could earn in a few lifetimes.Here in America our insurance companies amazingly regard a sex change as cosmetic surgery. Scary idea, but true. Recently I had some talks with a transgender person from the United Kingdom. There the debate is whether their socialized medicine system should be paying for the sex change. Either way it is frightening situation that Hoffman is put in with all that cash suddenly in his possession and the chance of matching heart and soul to body can be realized.Especially after just winning an Oscar for Capote, Philip Seymour Hoffman isn't worried about getting cast in gay roles. From the lovestruck Scotty G in Boogie Nights, to Flawless, and now to Capote, Hoffman's making one great career for himself going gay. But all three of those parts show an astonishing range and a courageous player willing to accept and master challenging roles.Of course Robert DeNiro is great, he's never anything else. And he's back in the world of lower Manhattan that he knows so well. His character turns out to be a person of great character and more than just physical strength.Flawless is a film that will make you laugh and cry, but even more important will make you think.

Robert De Niro is also believable as a gritty police officer recovering from a stroke.The most powerful thing about this film is that it doesn't gloss over stereotypes, but still makes the viewer feel compassion for both characters. Deniro's cop goes through a huge transformation from homophobe to someone who learns the value of people whom he may not fully understand, and does so with a delicate, nuanced touch.I love this movie, even if only for the scene with Hoffman talking to the Log Cabin Republican about their own bias against more flamboyant gays.

There are two separate stories here, and although they are interrelated, either one by itself would be enough for a whole movie. Robert De Niro and Philip Seymour Hoffman make a chemistry-rich pair, both entertaining and amusing, and their screen presence is deserving of a lot of attention-it is tragic that not one but two different stories get in the way of their electric charisma together.	The first storyline details a homophobic former New York City security officer named Walt Koontz (Robert De Niro) who, at the beginning of the movie, has a stroke while rushing to a nearby crime scene. He is burdened with partial paralysis on the right side of his body and speech problems, which can be overcome with the help of his neighbor, Rusty Zimmerman (Philip Seymour Hoffman), a flamboyantly gay drag queen who often practices his musically vocal abilities with fellow friends in drag. Walt's physical therapist recommends singing lessons from Rusty.	The other story involves a criminal named Mr. Z and his attempts to find the incompetent people who stole a large sum of cash belonging to him. As Walt'z recovery continues, and the relationship between him and Rusty becomes more stable, various characters must react to the danger of Mr. Z and his clan of criminals.	What makes this movie so amusing is the interesting personality clash between the characters of Robert De Niro and Philip Seymour Hoffman. I just wish De Niro's character was more active; for much of the production he is nothing but a metronome who is unable to speak or even move much. Some of the elements involving the gay drag queens are hilarious and contribute to the movie's effective mood, and Philip Seymour Hoffman is so deliciously clever as Rusty that I would nominate his performance for an Oscar almost immediately. The dialogue is witty and intelligent (I need some butch faggots over here.), taking advantage of the situations applicable and giving the movie a surprising emotionally gentle side.	Not much else of Flawless is gentle, though. The overwhelming majority of the movie is gritty, rough material intended for adult audiences only. The vulgarism and profanity seemingly never stop and the coarse atmosphere is prevalent. The film is shot in a grainy, high-contrast style, with excellent cinematography and mood development. None of this shocks us, however, since the film's director, Joel Schumacher, was behind such perverse movies like A Time To Kill, 8MM, and Tigerland.	Flawless has a lot of decent material but it just does not fit together because of the plot distractions. Too much plot has never really been an issue for Joel Schumacher; in A Time to Kill and 8MM he found focus with a central character, here he finds likable traits in two main characters, but allows the plot to control their inspirational qualities. If Schumacher were to reexamine this script with a different perspective, perhaps cutting the Mr. Z plot entirely, maybe it would work more effectively. As it currently stands, Flawless is a movie in which the actors work hard to overcome a plot heavy script and they do reign victorious in a few battles, but eventually lose the war.

We saw him in Almost Famous recently plus Magnolia and Talented Mr Ripley and he is without a doubt one of the finest actors working today.I saw the DVD and while it is fine, it is nothing extraordinary.

The antagonistic relationship between the two might've used a bit more smoothing over (occasionally it feels like they're winging it, and De Niro's speech impediment tends to vary), but with two such fine actors running the scenes, there are compensations. De Niro himself looks fantastic, and he doesn't try to command the picture or any of his scenes with Hoffman; he's such a team player that you automatically respond to him. A drug-czar subplot is old hat, and the dancehall girl-with-the-pure-heart stuff is an obvious cliché, it has all been done before. But the real problem with the movie is that times have changed and perceptions are different, and not all gays are drag-queens and not all drag-queens want to have sex-change operations. It's a moldy movie myth that the filmmakers don't seem to get (perhaps they were brought up in an earlier era and believe the stereotype?). The continual foul language is a strain to listen to, but the growing camaraderie between the two leads proves to have some interesting give-and-take. **1/2 from **** "},{"Title":"definitely.. an under-rated movie.","Date":"27 March 2001","Score":"3 out of 3 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Crime, Drama","Review":"  Flawless is the best movie Schumacher has ever done, when i first heard the plot, and the the bad reviews this movie got, i thought it was going to be a bad movie... anyways i saw it just because I'm a big fan of Mr.DeNiro, and believe me folks, this is a really good movie... with flawless performances...

Happiness is but a choice away. These characters show us how their choices were experienced, and hopefully it will help many others in their current choices.Thank you, Robert!

He's a New York drag queen teaching stroke victim Robert De Niro speech therapy and his performance is a life-lesson in the art of acting. He raises what would otherwise be an enjoyable. if minor, tale of a mismatched friendship into something close to essential. De Niro, too, is superb. I have always felt that playing someone with a disability is prone to Ham-a-Lot but De Niro is far too good an actor for that.It is a very likable movie but it is also very sentimental. De Niro is miraculously cured of his homophobia when he has a stroke while the drag queen are all just a bunch of pussycats. There is a sub-plot about some stolen money that turns the latter part of the film into something of a thriller, though not a very convincing one. There is no sense of danger; you know things are going to end happily. Schumacher is far from being a great director but he does make very good genre pictures.

When he suffers a stroke while trying to rescue a prostitute from being murdered in an apartment above his, Walt is recommended to begin taking singing lessons to restore movement on the right side of his face (which has become paralyzed). Due to the fact that he has little money and can't leave his apartment complex, Walt begins to take lessons from Rusty - who lives in a flamboyantly decorated area (Welcome to fairyland!) and is often visited by drag queen friends.This sounds like a lame buddy-movie formula - and it's not great - but it was better than I expected, especially coming from one of the cinema's worst living directors, Joel Schumacher. But even Schumacher has made some genuinely good films (Phone Booth and Falling Down are his best) -- and this is one of them.It's not all that good, but it's slightly above-average and is really worth seeing for its amazing performances. De Niro is good (in a role similar to that in Awakenings) but it's Hoffman - pre-Capote Oscar - who totally steals the show as Rusty, portraying him (or is it her?) as a deep and troubled human being. The little scenes such as the one where Rusty mentions his family and his conservative father are what add more to the character.This is a bit too gritty and dark -- it's not the light-hearted buddy comedy that the ads make it out to be (the trailer is totally misleading) -- but I found it engaging and well-acted.

Hoffman, who plays a character who's over-the-top doesn't have to actually *act* over-the-top, and it's a balancing act that never falters.  DeNiro's minimalist style is a brilliant counter-point and together they move the story along as smooth as Rusty's disposition.

That's exactly my feeling after watching Flawless. This was a film combining DeNiro, one of the great actors of all time, with one of Hollywood's best young actors, Phillip Seymour Hoffman. While I didn't expect fireworks, that combination alone should have brought at least a compelling tale. However, director Joel Schumaker as usual mucks things up. Schumacker seems to have good ideas for his films but only one Falling Down would I give a good grade too. Schumacker comes from the Micahel Bay school of filmmaking always make sure you put some fast event in every 2 minutes because otherwise the viewer won't like it. A stroy like this needed time to develop and obviously Schumacker wasn't going to allow it. Briefly the plot DeNiro is a security guard who was known as a hero many years ago for saving people from a hostage situation. He lives in an old apartment with many drag queens next to him(one is Phillip Seymour Hoffman) and DeNiro to say the least doesn't get along with them. He gets his satisfaction from whores but is lonely most of the time. Meanwhile, a messy subplot involving money and bad guys causes hell to break loose in the apartment. DeNiro hears a scream for help starts to act then gets a stroke which causes him to be paralyzed on one side. DeNiro then learns singing lessons will help get his voice back so he goes to Hoofman, a songing drag queen who eventually helps him. The scenes between DeNiro and Hoffman sometimes worked, especially the dramatic ones. Many of the dialogue is funny(this film is categorized as a comedy) but still feels awkward. However, the whole money subplot is not only boring, it takes a way from the good moments between the two stars. The performances were so-so. Hoffman is talented as the drag queeen altho the routine gets a little old. I admired DeNiro doing something different but I still get the impression he kind of sleepwalked through the role. The film could really use a third supporting charecter but no can do, everyone else is virtually forgettable. As is the movie. Overall, Flawless wasn't a complete bomb, but there were too many bad things to overshadow some of the good moments. It is certianly not one of the worst films in recent years, but quite possibky one of the most dissapointing considering the talent it had. Flawless is closer to completely flawed then flawless.R(strong language, violence) "},{"Title":"definitely.. an under rated movie.","Date":"17 April 2001","Score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Crime, Drama","Review":"  Flawless is the best movie Schumacher has ever done, when i first heard the plot, and the the bad reviews this movie got, I thought it was going to be a bad movie... anyways i saw it just because I'm a big fan of Mr.DeNiro, and believe me folks, this is a really good movie... with flawless performances...

Unfortunately, a hoodlum has chosen that hotel to leave his hooker girlfriend the money he stole from a sleazy crimelord.  When violence and shots ring out, Koontz rushes up to investigate, but the fit, handball-playing and tango-dancing Koontz inexplicably suffers a stroke before even getting to the scene.In the most poignant scene out of otherwise trite and contrived scenes, Walter sits at home feeling sorry for himself, holding a gun to his temple for hours on end.  He gets a visit from a psychologist (the Indian actress Madhur Jaffrey) who arranges physiotherapy at home even though it will be more expensive than at the hospital.

There was a much better pacing of sensitive, tender family and neighborhood moments and sleazy, raw mob violence about a stash of hidden money in NIGHT ZOO (UN ZOO LA NUIT).  In this case the sensitive component is jarred by the madcap world of Rusty and his drag queen friends.  There were implausible plot elements mentioned above, plus expecting the audience to believe that Koontz in his condition could get a ravishing new girlfriend at the dance club when his old girlfriend/prostitute relationship dumps him.

He is able to do this to the point of the viewer not being able to recognize the actor - the greatest compliment an actor can receive. De Niro is De Niro, delivering a spot-on performance of a man struggling with change due to a stroke. The rest of the cast delivers an entertaining array of characters, which just adds to my disappointment with the film. Because, as good as the acting was, the directing - and to some extent the writing - was a let-down. Much of the violence seemed misplaced in what was a touching, humorous story. A few times I found myself pulled away from the story and wondering why Schumacher felt he needed to add someone being shot in the head. The ending was simply ridiculous - meant more for a Sylvester Stallone I-can't-believe-this thriller than for the emotionally-gripping story that Flawless should have been. This is a good movie.

But there is a pay off in the end. But, the most powerful take-away from this film is how the pursuit of positive self-esteem is a struggle for people no matter who they are.  And people need other people to help build and reinforce their positive self-esteem. Without this, people are empty.  I also like the message that there is good in everyone, even though it's hard to see it sometime.Phillip Seymour Hoffman is incredible in this role.  But, this role was so well-written, that it gave this actor something truly wonderful to work with.  Robert DeNiro is always good.  It's surprising to me that he would take a role like this, but he was getting type-cast in mob and criminal roles.  Bravo to him for doing this picture.

Usually the stock line of careers or occupations dominate one's daydreams in answering this question. Curiously, this film does not go in this easy direction. Rather the main characters, Walt and Rusty, as well as the supporting players are seeking more profound answers to this common query.From Walt and Rusty to ChaCha and Carmine the pizza guy, we see people living each day in pursuit of the existence that fits them best. For outward appearances and in his surroundings, Walt appears to be the most together character in the film. But is he? His life is definitely flawed as he has no meaningful contact with another person other than his poker and beer buddies. He seeks a hollow substitution in the dance hall escort he tangos with (she is no 'Sweet Charity'!). However Walt is not a hopelessly flawed person which he heroically demonstrates on the night of his stroke as he attempts to assist an unknown neighbor. We feel sympathy and to a degree empathy for Walt's plight as discarded husband and emotionally lost loner.Next comes Rusty. From all external appearances, Rusty's difficulties with life are visibly apparent. However if one stops there with Rusty, they miss the real story of his flawed existence. Philip Seymour Hoffman steals this film as the female impersonator with wit and a sharp eye for seeing the needs of others. But even though Rusty wrestles with his soon-to-be trans gender journey, he is open and frank about his inner demons which define and offer an explanation of his gender identity crisis. In the end, Rusty genuinely connects with Walt because he senses and feels isolation from family and others just as Walt does. We see that Rusty's caring nature is genuine and limitless as he uses his 'operation' money to pay for Walt's treatment after being shot during the film's final scenes. Hoffman truly takes a character that easily could have been portrayed and seen as a one dimensional caricature and turns Rusty into a flawed but three dimensional person of complex needs and inner strength.Flawless is not the human condition. Rather, recognizing our flaws and working to change or improve one's life situation becomes the true test of an individual's worth. The 'flawless contest' in the film serves as a microcosm of people's pursuit of perfection in in imperfect world.Surely Rusty and Walt exhibit an inner strength as they find in each other that they have more in common than not. And more than each one could ever have imagined!

It's been out in England since November, but most English readers probably won't have heard of it. It's a buddy movie about a drag queen and a homophobic security guard who suffers a near-paralysing stroke. It's written in the style of a GCSE drama piece and directed by Joel Shumacher, he of Batman And Robin fame. Not exactly a mouthwatering prospect, you say? Perhaps you are wondering why it got a release at all. Well, because it stars Robert De Niro and Philip Seymour Hoffman, and they are two of the finest actors working in film today.De Niro plays Walt Koontz (we know he's the security guard because he has a mantelpiece full of trophies, plays cards and eats donuts). Hoffman is Rusty Zimmerman, who lives next door (he's the drag queen, obviously, because he's brash, claps his hands excitedly and says things like `Well, life's a bitch, so I became one, honey!'). After his stroke, Koontz has to side step his ultra-conservative beliefs and take singing lessons with Rusty as part of his speech therapy. Cue some touching odd-couple moments around the piano and the gradual realisation for Koontz that - shock! - those crazy homos really aren't so bad after all.De Niro played a comparable role to better effect in Awakenings, and Hoffman is not as impressive as he was in Happiness or Boogie Nights, but the two leads are generally convincing, and enjoy some inevitably fantastic moments. The chemistry between the two, however, which must be tight to drive an essentially theatrical movie like this, is distinctly lacking. A European filmmaker with a greater grasp of subtlety would give the characters more time to breathe (Almodovar's All About My Mother trod similar territory with electrifying results), but Schumacher's dire script insults the audience by assuming that the story needs constant emotional crisis to hold the attention. And so we are provided with deaths, gunfights, parties, and tragic telephone calls all of which are contrived, plot-driven devices, which demean the relationship between the two central characters to the kind of schmaltzy emotional pornography which usually involves Robin Williams (the script stops just short of including an AIDS death, or a speech explaining Koontz' hatred of homosexuals, although one can be certain it would have had something to do with an abusive father).The treatment of the gay men in the movie, though stereotypical, does not pander entirely to the expectation of a straight audience, as one might accuse Hollywood product like The Birdcage of doing. And, as director, Schumacher is reasonably accomplished and has, thank heavens, suppressed his previously flamboyant tendency and instead developed the gritty style he established well in 8mm. Like Curtis Hanson's recently released Wonder Boys, the general style (and the casting of Hoffman) suggests he has been paying heed to independent cinema and that can be no bad thing. But his frequent use of handheld camera fulfils no function whatever, and his neon lighting and clichéd gangster scenes (mostly of the `Gimme back my muthafu***n money, bitch' variety) more resemble a Tarantino pastiche than a distinctive voice of his own. Add into the mix two entirely irrelevant subplots and an overwhelming weight of tragic over the comic, and you are left with a movie that, despite some good performances, is anything but flawless.  "},{"Title":"well-intentioned but uneven drama","Date":"22 April 2000","Score":"2 out of 3 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Crime, Drama","Review":"  A small film filled with laudatory intentions and high-powered star performances, Flawless, is, regrettably, better in its individual parts than as a whole.  This most opposite of opposites-attract love stories features a homophobic stroke victim and a less-than-gorgeous drag queen who forge an unlikely friendship as neighbors in a rundown apartment located in a crime-infested section of New York City.In the early part of the film, writer/director Joel Schumacher fills in the backgrounds of this retired cop and this struggling chantreusse, drawing parallels between their seemingly alien worlds, intercutting, for instance, between the subdued ambience of a straight dance club and the raucous atmosphere of a no-holds-barred transvestite stage performance.  As the two neighbors brush up against each other in occasional random encounters in hallways and elevators, we see the seething hatred that comes from the fear of the unknown and the inexplicable that routinely divides human beings one from another.  Then Walter Koontz is felled by a stroke which leaves him paralyzed on one side and virtually without the ability to speak.  On a doctor's advice, Walter swallows his pride and asks Rusty to give him singing lessons to help him regain his speech.Thus, the stage is set for a couple of characters who intitially feel they are worlds-apart in their lives, interests and values, to discover the common humanity that lies beneath the surface and actually ties them together.  The stroke, as the great leveler, makes Walter, in particular, cognizant of the struggles Rusty has had to undergo as a result of his very noticeable difference.If Flawless had stuck to this two-character format it might have been a more powerful film.  Two elements weigh it down, however.   One is the overly familiar and predictable arc the film travels;  we simply know well in advance where this story is taking us.  More serious are the constant diversions in the form of superfluous subsidiary characters and obscure subplots that keep pulling us away from the movie's center of gravity - which are the dynamite performances of Philip Seymour Hoffman and Robert DeNiro who invest both their tricky roles - one dealing with a physical handicap, the other the flamboyance normally associated with the drag queen stereotype - with a subtlety and humanity that could easily have been lost in a welter of method-actor hamminess and hyperbole.  Instead, both actors - especially Hoffman - rivet our attention in a way that few of the other elements in the film do.  Particularly annoying are a routine drug-dealing subplot and an action movie denouement of astounding inappropriateness and stupidity. In a way too, the film is rather schizophrenic in its portrayal of gay people.  On the one hand, the drag queens are all made to seem fun and likeable, but, on the other, they also all fit the cliche of homosexuals often presented to the outside world.  In fact, the film expends no effort in according similar sympathy to straight acting gays, particularly in a scene in which the queens are confronted by a group of gay Republicans in suits who want the ladies to tone down their flamboyance for the upcoming gay pride parade.  Thus, in attempting to make an important observation about elements of homophobia lurking in the gay community itself, Schumacher, ironically, becomes guilt of the same crime himself.Flawless is worth seeing for the performances of the two lead actors, for its admirable call for tolerance and understanding and for its occasionally incisive encounters between these two very appealing misfits.  However, for a far less contrived, far more convincing examination of this subject, check out the Cuban film from a few years back, the delicious Strawberry and Chocolate.  That film achieves the type of thematic unity and gripping emotional power Flawless, despite all its good intentions, never really manages.

It's also too easy to say what is really irksome and artificial about this plot and its characters--a cliché of a broken down older cop and a apartment building shared with drug dealers, drug users, and most colorfully, a whole slew of cross dressers and transvestites. We know they are not going to get, even though we don't know why the cop lives there when he is so clearly out of place. And we know that the movie is about a reconciliation between these types--and stereotypes.Furthermore, the picture of these kinds of people, including the key transvestite played with a certain amount of conviction by Philip Seymour Hoffman, is one drawn by an outsider. Director Joel Schumacher is openly gay, but he is also open about not being part of the transgender world, and not understanding it at first.So for this reason, at least, the playing of clichés is too brazen and thin to be persuasive. I can't imagine people in the tranny community really being convinced, though they might still enjoy the scenes (being rare enough in a mainstream movie). But you do wonder why Hoffman was tapped for the role when there are so many really outrageously good, and excessive, actors equally and more capable in those shoes. Schumacher's explanation that he wanted someone who could play both sides of being a man seems thin. I'm guessing it was about getting two stars head to head. The writing, also by Schumacher, is painfully clumsy at time--people shouting stupidly out their windows, confrontations between drug dealers and other falling into bad clichés, on and on. And in all, it's kind of a rotten movie.Except...except for one redeeming quality that is quite beautiful, and this comes (tellingly) directly from the director's experience. And that is the way two people can be made to understand and even love each other (in their own hamstrung ways) as very different kinds of men. And how someone with a stroke can be made to sing, to come alive, even a little, more than they thought they could. Skip all the drug nonsense, all the blatant attention getting garbage that fills up most of the movie to the point of being either laughable or offensive, and enjoy what does work.

The situations and characters are rote, the unfurlment of emotions predictable. The directing is uninspired. DeNiro in my opinion has been uninteresting for decades -- his particular method is to find something in himself as the root of each character. The problem is that either he just doesn't have that rich a core or more charitably he mined it long ago.But Hoffman makes this all worthwhile. He plays a prefabbed role, and he is clearly working with a relatively superficial director who is taking everything straight. Also, he is hampered in that DeNiro is struggling so much, he can't give space.But Hoffman is a strange talent. He's not quite acting in the sense of becoming the character. Nor does he creep up on it through accomplished mimicry as, say Meryl Streep might. We know this because though the character is trite, Hoffman's person in the character is genuine. But it's not him, as we might get from Nathan Lane, or a long roster of stars who are always the same each time out, who essentially play themselves. (Think Harrison Ford.) And this is serious. He never winks at us as if to say `see what I can do?'This depth disturbs, quite apart from the film. I wonder what it costs him, and whether he will start to coast as dull fame descends. For now, I'll expect to see everything he does, and I recommend him in this.

While De Niro is affectingly understated, Hoffman is so over the top he makes Nathan Lane look macho. Joel Schumacher pours on the pathos as the film builds to a strained action movie climax. It's a drag all right.

This is a comedy/drama. But I'd double bill them any day, and curl up for a torch-song fest.I know there are gay republicans these days. I know you don't have to be a drama queen to be a queen, you don't need to sing to be a female impersonator, and heaven forbid anyone should sing 'glad to be gay' or limpen their wrist a la Naked Civil Servant - but, hey, sometimes you just want to embrace the cliché.I wanted to embrace all of the clichés on display here - with the sole exception of the whore-with-a-heart-of-ice, who I hope you too will boo, hiss and throw popcorn at... at the appropriate point, and I will say no more.I watch Blues Brothers regularly because I think Life Is Better With A Soundtrack. You know it makes sense - the soundtrack here is sympathetically chosen, and owes more to our glorious predecessors than to their wannabe descendants.'You think you're a hero?

I watched with my parents tonight, and ended up being embarrassed that I rented it for them. The usually fabulous Hoffman was unwatchable, even when De Niro was on screen. If he said honey one more time I was going to scream. The premise was interesting, but the direction and script were just bad, not surprisingly, given Schumacher's previous efforts. It was full of stereotypes about homophobes and homosexuals alike. Skip this one.

However, these two men gave it their all and were very convincing in their roles, especially Hoffman.While the whole drag scene was a bit camped up for the masses, it was quite entertaining.  Pay attention to Jackie Beat and Joey Arias (NYC divas), for they're only on camera a couple of times.I enjoyed this film, only because the acting was outstanding (for the most part).  If you are looking for a film that reaches deep within the minds and souls of two people from different sides of the fence and their developing relationship, don't see this movie.  If you want some funny drag and good acting, see FLAWLESS.

It is a comedy and a action- both genres not nearly fulfilled - it is not funny and the action is a joke. The ending is predictable from the start... Old grumpy man who hates gays/transsexual's lives near one talks to the fellow and eventually loses his homophobic ways which shows in the last scenes which are over the top and quite ridiculous where he saves him from evil gangsters. OK, slightly more character development etc. but that sort of plot. I seriously urge people not to waste there time on this film- it seriously is awful. If you are watching it because it's a comedy with Robert De Niro see Kings of Comedy instead- Analyze this is better then Flawless for god sake!

Anyone who found this film to resemble anything close to reality needs a mental health check-up. Terrible, terrible performances, especially DeNiro who has already (badly) played this role before in that Robin Williams movie. The offensive, outdated cliches fly so fast and furious that I almost wanted to watch the film again just to count them. If you should choose to subject yourself to this piece of rot, stay alert to keep your brain from melting out of your ears. Schumacher is a hack! Down with Schumacher!

Hoffman's depiction of Rusty was, throughout, brilliantly executed, unflinchingly revealing, compassionately sensitive, and deeply rewarding to witness.  It will stay with me for many years to come as an example of superlative acting and a testimony to the enduring passion of the human spirit.

And its long too!  For awhile, I thought I was going through DeNiro's therapy in real time!  I don't know where Philip Seymour Hoffman gets his inspirations from, but if there were more drag queens like his in the world, there would be more lousy movies, too!  I couldn't spend more than three minutes with the guy, or his boyfriend, fellow queens, etc.  It was all bad. There was one very funny scene in which the queens meet their Republican counterparts, in an effort to make a 'united' front at the upcoming gay pride parade.  If the entire movie was that good, this comment would never exist.  "}]
