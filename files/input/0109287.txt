Many years since I actually watched it. The story was entirely surreal, but nonetheless great! What anyone who rates and reviews movies ought to bear in mind is what the respective movie aims at. It's the same with First Kid, which follows a similar pattern. Certain movies - like this one here - just aim at plain and comical nonsense. Such movies can't be rated from the point of view of a hypercritical reviewer. Of course these movies lack quality, lack a sophisticated storyline, very often lack first-class acting, but if they do fulfil their primary premise - that's okay. I don't have this movie here on my list of all-time favorites, but I still thought it was funny, had some very enjoyable sequences and made a good story. Brian Bonsall is a smart actor anyway.

He needs money. Badly. He attends a little brat's birthday party and after seeing all his big-spending friends and the birthday boy, decides it's time for a change. Now we know his own special day is approaching. His thrifty father provides him with an $11 check, and as he goes down to his local bank to cash it, a recently-released thief named Carl Quigley(played convincingly by Miguel Ferrer) runs over his little bicycle. Eager to avoid the police, Quigley gives the kid a blank check and takes off. The check has fallen into the wrong hands, as Preston fills it in for a cool $1m and what do you know, has no trouble cashing it! Things get worse for the boy after a spending spree, as the money will eventually disappear, and a certain someone will be longing for that fortune. I enjoyed Brian Bonsall's and Karen Duffy's little friendship, along with friendly limousine driver Rick Ducommun, but the plot is way too basic, and my opinion remains the same now, as it did in 1994, when I first saw the film.

Preston Waters a depressed 10-year old. His brothers, Damien and Ralph have moved their business into his room, he also didn't have much fun at Butch's birthday party at Funland (Fun, Fun, Fun for everyone!) The reason he didn't enjoy himself was maybe thathe couldn't do much with only six tokens, or maybe because he doesn't even like Butch.         Preston then goes to the bank to open an account with $11 he got for his birthday. That same day, Quigley was in the bankpresident, Beiderman's office. They were in a money laundring process. When Quigley leaves, he runs into Preston's bike and begins to write a check to pay for it, but splits when he sees the cops, so Preston takes the blank check home. His parents yell at him because his bike is totalled. So with the help of his computer, Preston writes a check for $1,000,000, and at the bank, Beiderman thinks Preston is one of Quigley's men so he gives him the money. Preston soon goes on a spending spree. He buys a big house, a limousine with chauffer Henry.He also buys all kinds of things. Now back when this movie was made, 1994, $1,000,000 was ALOT of money and could buy alot of things, unlike today, 2002. Quigley finds out what happened and he, his henchman, Juice, and Beiderman go to look for Preston. Now you're probably wondering how a 10-year old kid could pull all this off, well, Nosey! He created an A.K.A name, Mr. Macintosh (got the name from his computer). Only problem, a pretty lady from the bank, Shay Stanley, needs to speak to Mr. Macintosh, but Preston takes her out to dinner and they talkabout him. They go for a dance in a restaurant spraying fountain.          It's going along great for Preston. He throws a big bash because it's Mr. Macintosh's birthday (and his). It's around that time that the shiot (SHEE-OT) really hits the fan. He's run out of money and he owes a debt, so the party is off. The crooks show up and Preston handles them Home Alone style. The FBI are also involved now, and Quigley decides to take over the identity of Macintosh to hide, but now he and his counterparts go to prison, so once again, Preston is a normal kid; this movie is pretty good. Brian Bonsall from Family Ties is in it, so is Karen Duffy, Tone Loc, Miguel Ferrer (son of Jose Ferrer), and Michael Faustino, brother of David Faustino from Married...with Children. So I recommend this film. - "},{"Title":"If not a guilty pleasure for you, expect a child's Disney movie (and nothing else)","Date":"17 December 2007","Score":"2 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Crime, Family","Review":" The summary says it all. Blank Check is just one of those movies.The story follows Preston, a young boy who obsesses over money just as quickly as he spends it. One day Preston is riding his bike around, and thus the story begins. He's struck by a car, and although he's okay the driver hands him a blank check to avoid any trouble. Preston goes ahead and fills in one million dollars for that check and manages to cash it and purchase a house and several other excessively self-indulgent items. The man who hit Preston, Quigley, has a darker and more dangerous history and is far from happy when he realized one million is missing from a money scandal he's involved in. The story follows Preston as his greed with money leads him down a tunnel that grows only deeper and deeper. As he makes up lies for spending so much time at a mansion that his parents don't realize he owns and manipulates others around him, Quigley embarks on a journey to hunt down the man (or boy) that took his money.Blank Check is not realistic and is completely implausible in real life. We all have our own little guilty pleasure movies, whether its Spice Girls or Power Rangers or Rugrats or Blank Check. If this movie doesn't become one of those guilty pleasures, chances are you won't enjoy it and will find it shallow and worthy of several Oh, yeah rights. Needless to say, this is a good family film.

We then cut to Preston Waters as an 11 year old kid who is harassed by his family about money. His older brothers run a Lawn Cutting business, and the parents treat them better because they are already making money, and saving. They buy the brothers a new computer and place it in Preston's room. Preston tells his dad about that it's his room, but his dad scolds him for Preston not making money. The brothers though have no idea how to run a computer, and mess it up. Yeah I can see why these are the favorite ones (sarcasm). Eventually the family goes to a party and Preston is sent to ride on kiddie rides while the others are on better rides like a roller coaster. Preston even gets a birthday card, and only an $11 check. How cheap does this family have to be to Preston? He's already being pressured to find a job, and he's only 11! Is this some world where child labor laws don't exist? Preston goes to the bank to set up an account, and meets Shay Stanley who tells him he needs $200 to open an account. We then cut to the villains of the movie, Quigley, and the head of the bank, Biderman. Quigley learns the bills are marked, and sends for Juice, his other henchman. Quigley leaves, but accidentally runs over Preston's bike. Quigley writes a check, but before completing it he sees the cops, and hands Preston a blank check (ladies and gentlemen we have a title!). At home Preston's mom and dad are angry because Preston's bike got run over, and they scold him about not taking care of his valuables, and ground him. Seriously someone needs to call Child Services and take the kid away, and arrest the parents for negligence. Preston decides enough is enough, and uses the check to forge a $1 million check. Preston goes out to the bank (wasn't he grounded?) and meets Biderman who believes he is Juice, and gives him the million dollars. The real Juice comes by, and both realize they have been duped by Preston. Now to be fair, Juice seems to be the only enjoyable person in this movie. Preston creates a new alias name, Mr. Macintosh, and buys a home for himself, a limo driver named Henry who supposed to be comedy relief, but isn't funny at all. Preston meets Shay again, and tells him that Mr. Macintosh would like to meet her. We then learn that Shay is actually an FBI agent who is looking for Quigley, and the other villains. They even watch Mr. Macintosh since they consider him an interesting person which makes no sense considering that all of Macintosh's business is done by a kid. They honestly don't think it's weird or something? From here on in the movie uses a lot of filler with Preston on a shopping spree. I wouldn't mind it so much, but it keeps going on, and on. Preston explains that he has a new job as Mr. Macintosh's assistant to his family, and being the idiots they are they believe it. We get more scenes of Preston riding Go-Karts, playing games, hanging with the driver, buying a lot of ice cream, and so on. The movie then finally remembers it needs a plot, and we cut to, I wish I was joking, Preston taking Shay to dinner and then taking her to a geyser and get both of them wet. Meanwhile the villains are asking kids if they knew Preston, and one spills the beans on him, and they chase him down in the park. Preston and Shay get away and the villains are sprayed with the geyser. Preston then celebrates Mr. Macintosh's birthday, but it is his in reality, and soon realizes he has only a little over $330 in his account. Preston's dad comes into Mr. Macintosh's office, and tells him that he wants Preston to have a childhood, and to send him home early. What a hypocrite. Preston sends everyone home, and sits lonely around pondering his speech his dad told him. The villains though break into the home, and Preston needs to fight back. So the movie decides to go and rip off Home Alone with all the traps Preston sets up. The traps are dead ringers of Home Alone and too similar. Eventually Preston is cornered, and just as he is about to be killed, the FBI movie sin and Shay leads the party. The villains are arrested, and then in probably the creepiest moment in cinema history, Shay and Preston kiss on the lips. If this is romantic, the movie is wrong. This isn't romantic this is creepy on every level, and horrifying. I can imagine when parents took their kids to see this, they must have been shocked to see this scene. Shay continues the creepiness by saying she wants to see him in 6 to 7 years later. The FBI doesn't arrest her because? So the movie ends with Preston goes home to his family who celebrate his birthday obviously forgetting he lied to his family.Final Thoughts I can't imagine why this movie passed as a family comedy. There are too many creepy moments, and the movie is rather mean spirited. The plot is predictable, the characters are flat, the family is negligent, the humor is dreadful, the romance is creepy, and it steals from Home Alone. The only good thing in this move was Juice. Blank Check will leave a blank feeling in you, and you are better off picking up Home Alone then waste your time and money with this.

The story opens showing a convicted bank robber Carl Quigley (Miguel Ferrer) escape from prison, to which he immediately obtains a million dollars he had hidden for quite sometime. Before long, we meet ten-year-old Preston Waters (Brian Bonsall), who finds himself constantly pushed around by his investment-banker father, who continues to bask in the light of frugality. After receiving a blank check from his grandmother, Preston asks his dad to fill it out, to which he puts down only $11.00. All Preston wants is a little spending money so he can buy some toys and feel like he has some sort of freedom, rather than being confined to anything other than pocket change.One day, Preston is riding his bike in a parking lot and winds up being struck by Quigley, who doesn't have time to stick around and fill out police reports, so gives Preston a blank check and tells it to give it to his father, presumably to pay for the bike since Preston is unharmed. Rather than giving it to his father, Preston recalls the blank check of his grandmother's and decides to cash it for $1,000,000. Before he knows it, Preston is filthy rich at the expense of Quigley, who, along with his goons, now needs to track down a kid while struggling to adhere to his criminal plan. Meanwhile, Preston lives the dream, buying a house, numerous accessories, and all the materials he could ever want.Anyone who says they didn't dream of something like this, or tries to shout at Preston for being materialistic, is ridiculous. Preston's attitude is no different than a lot of us when we were younger, whether we'd like to admit it or not. Not to mention, Preston acts entirely on impulse throughout the entire film, as most of us did when we were younger, providing situational realism. The kid isn't a god-child who would donate all the money to charity, nor is he using his money to try and manipulate and control others. He is a kid acting out his dream of having enough wealth to live without the worries or authority of his parents chiming in and ruining his fun, and I don't know what kid didn't want that kind of security growing up.Blank Check also, some way, somehow, manages to sustain a romantic relationship between a young kid and an older woman in a surprisingly genial, refreshing manner. Early in the film, Preston meets the gorgeous Shay Stanley (Karen Duffy), a bank teller for the bank Preston winds up cashing his check at. Preston quickly falls in lust with Shay, mainly for her elegant conversations and her radiant appearance, and tries to sustain something of a romantic relationship with her, even though all signs point to impossibility. In unsteady hands, this relationship could've been cheap and exploitative. Under the care and attention of director Rupert Wainwright and writers Blake Snyder and Colby Carr emerges a more gentler focus on the relationship, one that isn't haphazardly strung-along by nonsensical one-liners, but deep-rooted intimacy, despite both parties knowing they can't carry this on forever.Finally, there seems to be a lot of criticism with Preston's character being a brat. If one refers to Preston as a brat, then one must refer to Kevin from the Home Alone serious a brat as well. Preston is a character who simply wants some freedom and some liberties, which are not offered by his parents, so when he finally gets the opportunity to take responsibility and encounters his own finances, he is acting out on one of his oldest fantasies. If he's a brat because he wants a little leeway and space, then I suppose we were all brats at one point.Finally, there's the ending, which, like the remainder of the film, comes under certain scrutiny because the lead character allegedly doesn't learn anything. Blank Check's ending is quiet and low-key, never over-emphasizing the idea that now Preston appreciates all he had back when life was simpler. Had the ending been louder and more sentimentalized, it would still be criticized for its sappy handling of what should've been a quieter ending. The criticism here is especially ridiculous because, surprisingly enough for a Disney movie, Blank Check doesn't embellish its conclusion nor its character. It simply comes to a quiet, personal realization, evident enough for the audience to pick up, and concludes. As far as I'm concerned, the biggest issue with the film is its datedness, seeing as how the house Preston acquires would be enough to bankrupt him alone, even with one million dollars.Starring Brian Bonsall, Karen Duffy, and Miguel Ferrer. Directed by Rupert Wainwright.

But they have jobs. Preston is not old enough to have a job. However, his grandmother does send him a blank check for his birthday. Preston's Dad doesn't see it that way, though.

But as the pretty new teller Shay tells him, it is not even enough to open a bank account!Meanwhile, bank president Biderman is being asked to launder money by Carl Quigley. Biderman had some bad things to say about him in court, so Biderman will do this for him or else. Quigley intends to send someone to pick up the money the next day at 100.But as Quigley is backing out his car, he is paying attention only to the cops nearby. Preston has fallen off his bicycle, but fortunately, he sees Quigley's car in time. But not in time for his bike. Quigley writes a check but doesn't have time to fill it in. That's okay, though; Preston has a Macintosh computer at home that can do that for him. And he decides the check will be for one million dollars. When he returns to the bank, it is not Shay but a teller who looks like a lunch lady who almost rejects the check. But it is almost 100 when Preston is dragged into Biderman's office. Biderman offers Preston juice (or at least that's what he believes). Believing this is Quigley's flunky, Biderman actually gives Preston the money!And then the real Juice shows up with--guess what--ANOTHER million dollar check.What do YOU think is going to happen?Well, what does happen is very funny and includes a lot of physical comedy, most of that related to the bad guys getting what they deserve.A couple of additional details Biderman is being investigated by the FBI, and a reclusive mystery man named Macintosh is buying one of the finest houses in town and lots of toys and other fun stuff to fill it with. There are lessons to be learned here money is not the most important thing in life. Family and friends are. In fact, people are your friends only if they are still your friends when the money is gone.Several actors rise above the material James Rebhorn as Preston's Dad, Tone Loc as Juice, and sometimes Miguel Ferrer as Quigley. Brian Bonsall does a good enough job as Preston, and Rick Ducommun, as chauffeur Henry, convinces me that he is really Preston's friend. Karen Duffy is easy to like as the pretty teller. On the other hand, Michael Lerner (as the bank president) is never anything more than a cartoon character, and Debbie Allen as party planner Yvonne doesn't seem up to her usual standards.On My 48, I saw some obvious signs that language had been cleaned up, but not really anything that should make this film inappropriate for most children. Butch (who is a bully) is manhandled by the bad guys and even dangled off a tall building. And the bad guys do threaten others convincingly, but this is still little more than a live-action cartoon. It's really up to individual parents as to whether this is too much.You don't have to be a kid to like this, but it helps.

Two parts really offset me, the first is the romantic relationship that Preston (the protagonist) has with the teller at the bank is really creepy. I believe that another movie had kids, specifically boys interacting with adult women in a romantic way. That other movie was milk money, which is equally as bad. The other thing that offsets me is the climax that takes place at Prestons house. It directly rips off Home Alone in almost every way, except for the fact that you're not rooting for the main character.

I've heard this movie being compared to Home Alone. If you look at the movie cover, you'll see how it says, If You Loved Home Alone, You'll Love Blank Check. I've noticed many similar scenes to both Home Alone and Home Alone 2 as both movies were out by the time this movie was made. It is possible that the people who wrote and worked on this movie, came up with a lot of their ideas from Home Alone and tried to make a Disney Friendly slapstick humor of Home Alone with what a kid would do with $1 Million. I personally like this movie better than Home Alone. I feel like it has a lot more of a plot to it. In this movie, Preston tells his parents about wanting his own house, his own rules, his own money. While that might seem like a kid's dream he ends up being able to get $1 million. Some of the things that make this movie great. For one, watching this movie will take you back to the '90s. A lot of people from my Millennial Generation, old enough to remember the '90s miss those times considering life to have been really good back then. They try to remember life and entertainment back then. This movie shows an old computer in Preston's room. It also shows how rather than Preston buying things online like you would now, he just looks numbers up to call from a phone book. It shows some old arcade games and Preston having many TVs turned into his own virtual entertainment system. Something that still is incredible years later. It also shows '90s things like you see a lot of TVs that aren't flat screen. Also, one time I watched this with a friend my same age during the scene where we see Preston in the store riding a bike playing with the things inside the store. My friend told me he remembers when you used to be able to try things like that out at a store. I can't remember doing that as a kid. This movie entertains you showing all the things Preston bought. We see how a kid would spend all that money, he gets chased by the bad guys in this movie. We also see a lot of Preston's community in Indiana. Things like his neighborhood, a typical looking neighborhood with a castle house across the street, a really big bank in his town close enough that Preston rides his bike to, an amusement park, a water park, a public park (during the chase scene), Lots of really nice stores, businesses including Preston going to Tangerino's on a date. Also, one of the more memorable scenes from the movie where Preston and Shay dance in these fountains we all wonder where those fountains are. So, this movie is also better than Home Alone as we're more familiar with Preston's community than Kevin's in the first Home Alone. Also, a whole community of people are curious about who Mr. Macintosh is, not ever meeting him only hearing Preston saying he works for him. People gullible enough to buy things from a kid, and believe a kid who claims he works for somebody they've never met. All this action takes place in like only a week time. So this movie has great music, it's fast paced, and it's funny. This movie will end leaving us with a couple of unanswered questions we're all curious about. They haven't made a sequel for this movie, or even an explanation as to what would end up happening later. Preston's the main character so he's a character we like. But, we ask ourselves even if he mostly seems like a good kid other than a little bratty and selfish. But, seriously I'm sure people would eventually discover including Shay that Preston was behind all that spending and that fake character, Mr. Macintosh. He might even confess it to his parents as he said as the movie was ending about Mr. Macintosh how he shouldn't have fooled everybody and told his Dad that he'd tell him all about Mr. Macintosh the next day. So, did Preston confess to his parents about being behind the whole Mr. Macintosh thing, and how would his parents feel if they found out Preston got $1 Million and bought a house? So, we wonder if Preston as a kid would have been arrested or eventually arrested if the police found out? How much trouble would this get him into? We also wonder what would happen with all the stuff Preston bought? The people in the movie, especially the ones that would clear out the house should figure that a grown man would not want to buy all that kid stuff. That is stuff a kid would buy. The final question is does Preston ever get together with Shay? Disney did not consider it inappropriate to show like an 11/12 year old kid in love with a 30 year old woman, going on a date with her, and kissing her. I wonder if Disney could get away with that now? But, while they did agree to see each other when Preston was older, they said 6 years and as this movie takes place in 1993 that would mean they were supposed to see each other in 1999. How about now, over 20 years later? Did they eventually reunite and fall in love? It should not have taken long after the movie ended for Shay to have discovered that Preston was behind all that spending and Mr. Macintosh. But, she liked him enough and was a gentle person. I'm sure she'd forgive him and not take it too seriously. Overall, I'd give this movie a 10/10 as it's always an empowering movie for me to watch. I think most kids even kids of today would enjoy this movie.

Well, everything. But it mainly boils down to money. It doesn't help that his older brothers have stolen what little life savings he had and on top of that need his room for their marketing job.Things keep getting worse when a town bully decides to embarrass him and later steal his birthday check. Incidentally bad guy Carl Quigley (played by Miguel Ferrer) happens to run over Preston's bike and explodes at him, but the town bully seems to decide to give Quigley some trouble. Quigley apparently just out of prison decides to write a check for the bike but seeing a cop, gives Preston the check with only his signature and takes off in haste. Preston later realizes this and fills it out for $1,000,000. But what's really going on is that bank owner Biderman (Michael Lerner) is supposed to give $1 million to a guy named Juice (Tone Loc), and just so happens to mistaken Preston for Juice.So now, the theme takes place with Preston (also using alias Macintosh, the name he gave when prompted after buying the house, where he used his Macintosh computer to speak) partying like no tomorrow and dating an undercover bank lady Shay (Karen Duffy). But these three guys are after Preston, yet unaware that Shay and the FBI are also after these three guys and eager to meet this so called Macintosh. And one thing for sure is that this ain't going to end to happy (well, it might for a PG film but it'll get a bit tense before a happy ending) While this film has so many flaws, I have found it very addicting to this day. I've probably seen it +20 times.For one thing, the cast of actors/actresses is pretty decent.Miguel Ferrer (from Another Stakeout and Hot Shots 2) seems to be his usual 'bad behavior' bad guy (popping a little kid's balloon and cutting Biderman's phone).James Rebhorn (from Carlito's Way and My Cousin Vinny) plays as Preston's dad, and seems very PC type.Jayne Atkinson (from 24 as Karen Hayes) plays as Preston's mom.Tone Loc plays as bad guy Juice who was supposed to get the million dollars. He makes several wise cracks throughout the film.Michael Lerner (from When do we Eat) plays as a big fat bank owner Biderman, who seems very funny when it comes to making excuses.Karen Duffy plays as the undercover FBI agent passing off as a bank teller who Preston has the hots for.Debbie Allen plays as Preston's party planner, who just seems to show up out of the blew and seems to take over the film in the few scenes she can (although it's very funny when someone pulls part of her fake wig off and she screeches).And Rick Ducommun plays as Preston's friendly limo driver who at one point goes on about how he doesn't understand those philosophical expressions.Overall a very flawed but enjoyable film. The actors/actresses above really keep the film entertaining.

Walt Disney really outdid themselves this time. The comedy is most of the times expected but the other times unexpected. I mean was this movie OK or was this movie OK. It also teaches a lot about wise youths and I this kid is really wise and a bit time smart pants. But also it sucks. How the heck could a guy like that kid get a hot police babe and his dad let him go free. That's like let a killer get bailed free for ten years. If I were to do that I'd get beaten with a 'suble jack'(a huge stick that stings when used to bench your butts really hard). That kid is really lucky. Back to the story. The movie makers really knew what they were doing when they made this movie but still it's not perfect. The acting was good and bad. The kid and woman had no chemistry neither did the father but the bros were excellent'. The special effects on the other hand was lame. Plus this movie isn't based on reality.

On the way he ends up having to keep track of a few lies, including the whereabouts of the elusive Mr Macintosh (who never actually existed).Not the best film in the known universe but worth a watch to see what the fuss is about. Unfortunately, everybody looks bored on this movie, including the main star, Brian Bonsall, who looks bored from the outset, and so the movie develops a sense of well the character doesn't seem to care so the viewer doesn't care either. This is its weakest link really, in spite of the generally half baked plot and a half baked sequence of events.By the movie's nature, it opens up a whole can of worms for plot hole purposes for anybody over the age the movie's aimed at. Such as whether any bank in the known universe actually hands out this much money to one so young, or whether said backpack is capable of holding such vast amounts of cash in the first place. Still, if Preston didn't get the million dollars, the movie would only be about 15mins long and not go anywhere.Worth showing the kids who aren't going to try and pick the plot holes out (there are a few in here, see if you can spot them) and is generally good clean entertainment that one comes to expect from Disney, even if it doesn't lend itself well to repeat viewing.

Read the other reviews, ALMOST everything that needs to be said has been said already. There is however, one big thing that other reviews have either not mentioned enough of or forgot about entirely, and that's how terrible the main character's parents are!This kid is suffering with parents who lets the two older brothers take over his room for their stupid lawn moving business, not to mention buys them a new computer. And then there are the lectures about how the older brothers know how to make money and save money, while the younger son doesn't. Later on, the kid almost gets ran over, but luckily only his bike is destroyed, and the parents care more about the cost of the bike, than the safety of their child, and lecture him about protecting your valuables and ground him.OK. 2 teeny-tiny eency-weency little things. 1 HE'S 11!!!!!!!!!! He's not even supposed to be saving money or making money at that age! You might as well be saying, Well son, you've just finished kindergarten, so when are ya getting' that job? 2 THOSE PARENTS SHOULD BE SHOT!!!!!! The only reason this kid is obsessed with money in the first place is because his parents are! And they ground him for nearly getting hit by a car and possibly seriously injured or even killed because he didn't protect his bike? I'd bet if he did get killed, they probably would celebrate because of the money they'd now save.You know what, after having to deal with these parents, I'd say give the kid $1,000,000 and a hot chick! And sentence his parents to death by firing squad!I'm not gonna talk any more of this film, because those parents disgust me enough. The rest of the film isn't any better.Except for one little bit of trivia The actress Karen Duffy (who was the only good thing about this movie) plays the character Shay, and then plays another unrelated character also named Shay in Dumb & Dumber which came out only 10 months after Blank Check.

Our heroine fails to realize during this whole adventure that the criminal the FBI is pursuing is slipping and sliding right behind the two, as they make their way to Preston's limousine, complete with a 1-dimensional driver who never fails to provide cheap, 3rd rate laughs that the whole family can choke on.Overall 1/10 is incredibly gracious for this film. I don't see how it only has a 4.4/10.
