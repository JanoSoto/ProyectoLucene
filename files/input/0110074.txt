[{"Title":"Long Live The Hud!","Date":"11 June 2004","Score":"90 out of 97 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Fantasy","Review":"  Another fascinating piece from the Coen Brothers, 'The Hudsucker Proxy' is an homage to the films of the 1930s. From the grey faux-Gothic cityscape to the over-the-top acting and rapid fire dialogue to the subdued colors to the stark sets, this film hearkens back to an earlier era of films. The plot is simple enough. When company president Waring Hudsucker commits suicide, the board of directors, led by the deliciously evil Sidney J. Mussburger (Paul Newman) determines to devalue the stock by putting a 'shmoe' in charge of the company so that when the late Hudsucker's controlling interest in stock hits the market in 30 days, Mussburger's cabal can snap it up on the cheap. Enter shmoe Norville Barnes (Tim Robbins). Jennifer Jason Leigh is the newspaper reporter who infiltrates Hudsucker Industries under the guise of secretary, and is Barnes' love interest in the film.Robbins performs more than adequately but is outshone by terrific performances by Newman and, in particular, by Leigh, who absolutely nails this role. Her saucy, lilt of the tongue is wonderful; she simply oozes sensual sass, and all in the very decent parameters of decades gone by in Hollywood.Other highlights of the film include - the wonderful sets, where less is more; the usual Coen cinematography, which makes the film a visual delight above and beyond acting and plot; the clock (an unbilled role, in a sense). Curious characters pop up and return &#150; Buzz the Elevator Operator, the Clock Maintainer, and many others. And, of course &#133; that clock!As will all Coen brothers films, this one calls me to see it again, as I always seem to discover new elements when watching their works for the second, third, fourth times, and beyond. A very worthwhile film &#150; enjoy!7 out of 10  "},{"Title":"This film gets better with each subsequent viewing","Date":"22 February 1999","Score":"96 out of 122 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Fantasy","Review":"  The first time I saw this film, I enjoyed it.

Still more revelations.In fact, every time I see it, and I'm sure to see it again, I enjoy it more and more with each subsequent viewing.This film's narrative is nearly as perfect as the Hula Hoop itself, despite the albeit fictional account of the invention of said dingus.But it strikes me as odd and unfortunate when I encounter someone who's seen this and not enjoyed it.All I can say is, have you tried it more than once? It isn't exactly what I'd call an acquired taste, but when you see how rich in detail and humour it is, you may begin to appreciate it for what it truly is; a great film that deserves a second chance.

The Coens are geniuses when it comes to making movies that I really can enjoy. I admit, I first saw O, Brother, Where Art Thou? and loved it so much. I had no idea this was by them too, and had I not seen a Making of on a show on Discovery years ago that showed how the scene where they fall off the building was done, I probably wouldn't have ever decided to TiVo this fine film.The direction technique, acting, jokes, everything just works. This is the kind of movie that stands out in the crowd, makes me want to buy it on DVD and show it to everyone I know just to make them see what people miss when they read reviews by people like Siskel and Ebert, who gave it two thumbs down, but don't give a reason on their site.Other movies I would recommend are O, Brother (Also directed by the Coen's) and Army of Darkness, which, maybe coincidentally, stars Bruce Campbell who plays a reporter in this movie. Bruce is his same old self. he has a presence, and is great in the few scenes he's in.Tim Robbins is wonderfully cast as the lead in this role.The elevator operator lent a wonderful character to the movie.The two Cab drivers in the Caf√© who perform the I got gas Bromo commercial type bit, were great narrating Norville's encounter with Amy.The guy in the News room creating the Crossword puzzle with a Scrabble set asking people questions for clues.

A huge flop, film lovers with a sense of history and humor will be gushing about this one for a long..long..time.  Bordering on a musical version of Brazil at points, it is as deliberately studied a critique of contemporary American capitalism as it is a searing stare at Hollywood.  Paul Newman like all of the Coens' and Raimi's meticulously selected actors seem literally born for their parts.  Using the most classical of Hollywood stylistic techniques in the most seamless manner, but with added auteur hyperbole they show us who we are through the comic lens of the camera, always reminding us that it is just a movie.

What I will say is this If you've never been interested in those 'old' films (i.e. anything before 'Police Academy 5'), then please read what I've got to say, and then watch this film.First though, a (very) brief history of film comedyIn the beginning, there were silent films. Charlie Chaplin made some, and generally speaking, they were rubbish.Then came 'The Talkies', and comedy films began to include - you guessed it - talking. However, they were mostly still just people getting hit on the head by pianos, and as such, they were funny, but not exactly thought-provoking...Then there was 'screwball'; an awful description of some of the finest and funniest films ever made, which used fast-talking, wise-cracking characters to devastating effect. Preston Sturges did them better than anyone else, and suddenly, films were funny AND clever.This film then, is the Coen Brother's tribute to their hero, and it is staggering. It has loads of the hallmarks of your typical, great Coen Brothers film - stunning to look at, great voice-over, funny looking fat-faced people, etc, but best bit of all is the dialogue, which easily stands up to to comparison with that of any of the 'classic' screwball comedies, and therefore, with the best of all time. A word of warning, though - don't expect to be able to sit back and take in everything this movie has to give without concentrating. A lot of the talking in it is FAST, and the gags come so quick that if you're not careful, you WILL miss some perfectly-crafted little vignette on life, and you'll have to use the rewind button.As you can probably tell, I really can't describe how good this film actually is. All I will say is that I highly recommend watching it on Christmas Eve, like I do every year, as seeing it will fill your heart with so much joy that the impending fights with close relatives will seem a million miles away...

And as always it is more than just a plot or an idea but an inspiring search for the meaning of life. In this case the story is maybe a bit too much like a Cartoon, and somehow I feel the Coens fell into a kind of a nostalgia trap here. My suspicion is they just had a little too much money at their disposal and fell in love with the wonderful equipment, the real and virtual set design and the wardrobe (technically and aesthetically the movie is as masterful as any of Coens&#145;s movies). So maybe someone should tell the Coens&#145;s investors Give them less money and they will turn any idea into a timeless feature that will bring in profits for decades.Movie buffs might enjoy comparing Hudsucker Proxy with Capra movies or John Farrow's The Big Clock. It seems the makers of Hudsucker wanted to charge every scene with symbolic meaning. It is too much the overall story is simplistic and rests on spindly legs. The heavy set design and the opulent epic style bring it to its knees. I felt a little sorry for Jennifer Jason Leigh. Her performance is terrific, but the script gives her only few good moments. She talks like a machine gun in the manner of the most sophisticated Screwball comedies.What makes this movie worth watching are small episodes that contain grains of wisdom. Best of all is the unforgettable double stitch incident (I will not give it away), a kind of a filmic parable that proves the Coens's brilliance. The use of a conference room table as a jumping board is an equally beautiful and very well directed scene, the repetition of it with an alternative ending really had me in (double) stitches.

Its like a crossword puzzle that dances through your memory by teasing you with clues that you use to assemble a pre-engineered interlocking marvel.I believe a Coen project has three elements and they build it that way. They begin with a major problem in narrative. These are well known; most have to do with the identity of the narrator, specifically names or roles. For this film, it is the fated role; for `Lebowski,' the name; for `Man who Wasn't,' it is recognition; in `Brother,' we had fate again but this time targeted on opportunity (rather than vehicle) for narration.The second element is the selection of the cinematic cloak to wear. I believe this is wholly unrelated to the first, in fact the arbitrariness is part of the fun. In `Man' it was noir; `Brother' adopted the indigenous narrative song (which led to both Homer and Teebone Burnette); here it is screwball. And not just today's screwball. When these guys mine, they go to the source lode and in this case it is Capra. In fact, I believe they started with Capra's original screwball, `It Happened One Night.' There, the man is a fast-talking news reporter who attaches himself to a popular phenomenon as a personality. The woman is successful (in terms of being rich anyway) and she masquerades as a `regular' girl. Turn that inside out and you get the outline for this. Add some other Capraisms and the gods in the machines and this is what comes out.Oh, and the third element pure cinematic experience. Visual metaphors, extreme images, manifold quoting, almost distractingly detailed sets. Here, all the actors support these three elements, and that is the marvel of Coen projects. Many other films really do believe that the story and the `quality' of the actors in making it real somehow carries power. This is much better, being rooted in intelligent inquiry and love of visual imagination.Robbins and Newman support this type of acting well. They have done so before. But there is always one actor at least that the Coens use as the white space the actor that only knows about one dimension of the project. Here, that is Ms Leigh. Even though she is being goofed on, she does the best work of her career.Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 4 Worth watching.

The film is so engaging and whacky that many unfamiliar with the Coen's style may be turned away by it. However, the Coens are filmmakers who know what they are doing and this film is a perfect blend of reality and surrealism. Reminiscent of a classic movie from the 40s or 50s The Hudsucker Proxy has an atmosphere and look to it that we seldom see anymore. Part of this is due to the fabulous set design and costumes. But also, the Coens' direction and dialogue are top notch. One particular scene (near the beginning of the movie, so don't worry about spoilers) concerning a newspaper, a coffee cup and a heavy wind fills you with magical glee and perfectly sets the scene of this fantastic fairytale-like fable. Some may be disappointed by the ending but on close inspection it is a brilliant metaphor in a film that says so much about success, failure and how people cope with both. Paul Newman, Tim Robbins and Jennifer Jason Leigh are superb and are backed up by a cast that all gleam with their own wonderful persona including Steve Buscemi (sadly not in it enough), Bruce Campbell, John Mahoney and Charles Durning. So, If you want to see a film that will fascinate you, make you laugh and fill you with that magical joy that only the Coen Bros. can supply then The Hudsucker Proxy is the film for you.

Jennifer Jason Leigh's performance is labored. She tries to squeeze every last snicker she can with her character. She misses the mark in my opinion, moving and talking with so much effort and pace - just to get a laugh - that in the end, she gets none.Paul Newman goes the other way - he understates his character and when contrasted to the lunacy of both the environment and the story around him - it makes for some great scenes. He makes a great villain in this movie - and for me, he's a large reason why the movie works.Tim Robbins does a good job, especially at the start of the film. His best moments come when the story and the environment overwhelm his character.There's great moments, like the ridiculous Muncie fight song, the Monty Python-esque mail room, Charles Durning with wings and the grim, faceless board members - with their inane questions and so frightened to lose their authority that they agree to virtually anything.This film isn't genius or anything, but if you enjoyed the antics of something like 'Arsenic and Old Lace' then this is worth catching.

Not many people know what a 'proxy' is, and Hudsucker sounds a lot like 'sucker', so it really freaks people out sometimes.That's a reason why it's so good!  From the moment it starts - with a 'comedic' suicide scene no less - the audience is left saying, Huh?  It stars Tim Robbins as a dimwitted mail room worker for a large company.  On his first day, the president (Charles Durning) kills himself, leaving Sydney J. Mussburger (Paul Newman) with a plan to elect a moron for the new company president so that their stocks can go down and they can sell.  Naturally, Robbins' character is picked.  After that, he gets barraged by co-workers, stocks, the press, and undercover reporter Amy Archer (Jennifer Jason Leigh).  Naturally, Robbins and Leigh fall in love.Sounds rather normal doesn't it?  Well, when you watch and meet characters like the immortal Clock Man Moses (Bill Cobbs) and the evil Aloysius (Harry Bugin), and even get a surprise visit from Durning's ghost, you'll change your mind.Of course, it's still no Godfather, but if you have nothing to do and feel like watching an interesting Coen comedy, pop in The Hudsucker Proxy, 8/10.

I will come back on those quirks later.I love the way the Coens always combine high-brow subtlety with  low-brow slapstick which makes it so accessible.  This movie is not heavy on subtlety but there are some genius moments in it to make it watchable again and again.  Newman for one is great in this movie and having the best of times. He makes minimal acting an artform.  Really, he could act anyone of that screen with his eyes closed.  Jennifer Jason Leigh is a contrast with her hand waving,her Katherine Hepburn- affected-ballsy way of speaking and general overacting but I guess she sets the scene quite brilliantly to complement the decor and general 30's feel of the movie.  You see, apparently the Coens have a penchant for the 30's movies style(and so they should.. Many a great movie was made in that decade) but the story in which an imbecile's dingus, against all odds became a total Fad and all the rage, doesn't quite fit that decade.  I can't think of any Dingus which became all the rage in the thirties (life was too hard for thingamabobs then, I suppose) and the earliest example, the hoolahoop, was definately a brainchild of the 50's (Life was good and spendable income to buy doodahs was more readily available ).  I don't mind that at all but I was confused to find out that it was set in the 50's because of all the visual and audible references to the 30's.  If Mussburgers office wasn't an art-deco Love-fest (that clock!)I don't know what is.I guess this review is definitely style over content but you know what? That just doesn't matter because plot is secondary to the visuals, and dialogue in this movie.  And that is just alright by me.  It is the reason why these movies are so good for repeat viewings.  Once you know a plot, you are not likely to watch it again just for the plot's sake.  It is the sights, the sounds the dialogue that makes you want to watch a movie again and again. Oh you don't believe me?  Name your favourite movie (not the one you tell your friends is your favourite but the one you watch again and again). What makes you want to watch it repeatedly?  Is it because you want to know what happens for the 100th time?  Ofcourse not!  You want to watch it for the 100th time because of the dialogue, the fun, the special effects the object of your desire etc. etc...Now I am not saying that plot is not important but I am saying that what makes Coen Brother's movies so good is that they think about their viewer/audience who wants to watch their movies until they can repeat every line in the movie(and becoming sad anoraks in the process).  I actually know people who watched the Big Lebowski half way and walked out of the cinema only to find them Lebowski addicts after one more viewing.  I am not naming names but you know who you are...I liked this movie the first time round... I know I will love it later...Now for the Coen parallels between this movie and the Big LebowskiJennifer's way of speaking was similar to Julianne's Maud. They were both feisty Brunettes who fall for the main character(I wouldn't call 'em heroes)The voice over to remind us that it is a fairytale at the beginning and end by guardian-angel-types. (Sam Elliot in Big and Bill Cobbs in the Hudsucker) Bizarre Dance Dream Sequences that have nothing to do with the plot but are hugely enjoyable. Blond Bombshell (Anna-Nicole Smith in Hudsucker and Tara Reid in the Big Lebowski)Who want to seduce the hero. Steve Buscemi.

Blood Simple, Raising Arizona and Barton Fink all displayed an energy and panache that had been missing from American film since the early seventies. The Hudsucker Proxy followed and it was the brothers most ambitious film to date. Steeped in fifties nostalgia the film deals with corporate greed and the invention and success of the Hula Hoop. Norville Barnes (Tim Robbins looking very much like Dagwood Bumstead) is in search of a job in the big city. Optimistic and filled with idealism he gets in on the ground floor of a big company and rises quickly only to be used as a pawn by a scheming board chairman Sidney Mussburger (Mr. Dithers?). Instead he turns the tables and makes the company millions with his invention. Enter a female reporter who attempts to expose the company's duplicity but instead falls in love with Barnes while Chairman Mussburger plots revenge. Proxy's first hour is filled with typical Coen imagery and fine tailored editing. A boardroom suicide is grand theatre and a montage of the Hula Hoop's accidental success is masterful. But once achieved Hudsucker becomes sluggish and uninteresting. Robbins' transition from the mail room flunky to board room tyrant is unconvincing while Paul Newman as Mussburger is too healthy looking an octenagerian whose passion in life is all consuming greed and power. Jennifer Jason Leigh is downright grating, lost somewhere between doing Hildy Johnson and her version of Dorothy Parker. The film is Capraesque (shades of John Doe mixed with Wonderful Life) and that's a bad fit for the acerbic, dark comedies the Coen's excel at. Visually Hudsucker is a good looking film but like the Hula Hoop in 59, it fades fast.

To put it simply, The Hudsucker Proxy is an exceptional movie, and even stands out in relation to the other Coen Brothers' films.  There's just so much to like in this film.  Tim Robbins' performance is great, as is Jennifer Jason Leigh.  Paul Newman is also a stand out.However, these performances would be for nothing if it wasn't for the marvellous script- witness the boardroom scenes in which the directors discuss how many floors it was that Mr Hudsucker fell (not including the mezzanine) or the scene in which they interrogate Norville about his new invention.  The script is also responsible for the fantastic line Y'know, for kids! which means nothing if you haven't seen the movie but now always makes me laugh whenever I think of it.A few days after seeing this, I also saw Fargo on video.  What I find difficult to believe is that Fargo won Oscars and was highly popular while The Hudsucker Proxy passed by relatively unnoticed (personally, I think Fargo is one of the weaker Coen Brothers' films).  If you're put off by the fact that you've never heard of The Hudsucker Proxy, don't be.  This is an absolutely fantastic film and I can't stress enough how much I would recommend it.

Though like Fink, The Hudsucker Proxy has its roots in old Hollywood, it's a different old Hollywood, that of Frank Capra and Preston Sturges.One of the first scenes is perhaps the most stunning - it takes place at a boardroom table, and that's all I'll say. To get on with the story After the death of Waring Hudsucker (Charles Durning), a nobody from the mailroom, Norville Barnes (Robbins), is chosen by the second in command, Mussburger (Paul Newman) to become President of this huge corporation, Hudsucker. Why? Well, it was Hudsucker's wish that the company go public. Mussburger figures if he can drive down the stock price, he and the board can afford to buy 51% and retain control. Thus the lowly Barnes, who walks around with a piece of scrap paper that has a circle on it. It's his invention - you know, for kids. A reporter (Jennifer Jason Leigh) realizes what Mussburger is up to and gets into the company as Norville's secretary. Poor Norville wonders who's trashing him in the press. Meanwhile, he goes to work on his invention.The sets in this film are huge, to emphasize the smallness of anyone who works at Hudsucker. The company is a slight exaggeration over a normal company - only slight - your pay is docked for just about everything, including a moment of silence for the late Hudsucker, and there are some things that are sacrosanct - like a blue letter. That's so important that when one secretary sees it in Norville's hand, she screams. The most obvious thing in the company is an enormous clock - an homage, perhaps to The Big Clock, and it figures into the story.The acting in The Hudsucker Proxy is good, if a bit frantic, probably another homage to early fast-talking films like The Front Page. The film is set in 1958, but the style is more '30s and '40s, particularly in the performance of Jannifer Jason Leigh, who does a Rosalind Russell in His Girl Friday and sounds at times like Katharine Hepburn.The Coens manage to throw everything at The Hudsucker Proxy from old movies, including an angel, so it will keep film buffs pretty busy. There are some hilarious scenes, and the result is overall a fantastic movie with some great people, including the above-mentioned and Bruce Campbell and John Mahoney. Great fun. And make sure you get a double stitch.

So did Paul, Tim, Charles and other principle cast members, and Roger Deakins (cinematographer) and Carter Burwell (music). A Coen Brothers masterpiece!

It better break eventually!","Date":"12 June 2008","Score":"3 out of 3 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Fantasy","Review":" Any audiences familiar with the work of oddball geniuses Joel and Ethan Coen could hardly have expected their latest labour of love (excitedly billed as this time it's a comedy!) to be conventional or play to expectations, but in 1994, the Coens were greeted with their first box office flop, scorned by baffled critics and audiences alike. Upon retrospect, it becomes clear that due to faulty advertising or otherwise, audiences were simply not approaching The Hudsucker Proxy from the right angle, perhaps expecting a less subversive, more straightforward laugh-fest. And while the film in question is often hysterical, its sole intent is not to make people laugh - The Hudsucker Proxy exemplifies the Coen brothers' tendency towards judiciously applied weirdness in the midst of profundity, but with a more channelled focus, the final product being a side-splitting, occasionally frustrating but consistently remarkable film, easily one of the strongest in the Coens' consistently impressive body of work. Almost as much a throwback to classic science fiction as the period screwball comedies it emulates, the Coens take influence both visually and thematically from the dystopian visions of Fritz Lang's Metropolis, Charlie Chaplin's Modern Times (the film's most obvious influence) and Terry Gilliam's Brazil, as the monstrosity that is Hudsucker industries grinds its dank, perpetually moving gears to the same nihilistic grind of the capitalist machine, its continual churning in and spitting out of new ideas proving a snidely introspective jab at the nature of the film industry itself. The utterly brilliant screenplay (written by the Coens and fellow quirky genius Sam Raimi) proves a superb send up of the ludicrously fast paced flurry of the business world, as moments of sublime silliness and slapstick comedy are juxtaposed with cutting social commentary without ever slowing the movie's continual breakneck pace. The screwball influenced dialogue exchanges and clever one liners are contemporary classics, (the continual banter between Hudsucker executives or coffee shop patrons narrating the romantic encounter between Barnes and Archer are hysterical) the film making its mark as one of the Coen's most consistently hilarious films, but also one of their most shrewdly intelligent in the midst of all of the trademark oddities and wit. The film's saccharine ending is the most obvious source of contention, borrowing unapologetically from It's a Wonderful Life, and while the sudden shift into Capra-esq soaring jubilancy does feel distinctly out of synch with the tone of the rest of the picture, its ironically wholesome feel does seem oddly subversive enough to merit debate over its quality. However much of an oddity the ending may seem, its inclusion can hardly be considered a creative misfire in such a uniformly whip smart work, and while viewers unwilling to supply their own justification or meaning for its inclusion may become frustrated with the jarring change in tone, the unexpected finale does shake up the film with a dose of irreverent cheerfulness much in the same way Barnes' influence is shown to be a blessing to the cold efficiency of Hudsucker Industries. Either way, Carter Burwell's music boosts the film's quality like none other, not a single note failing to perfectly encapsulate the mood of the scene, whether an operatic grandeur complimenting a faux dramatic sequence showing the arrival of a blue letter (straight to the boss, very important) or a plucky string orchestration keeping with the lighter, more irreverent tone of subsequent scenes. Similarly, Roger Deakins' pitch perfect cinematography as usual effortlessly blends the classically stylish with quirky innovations, making for a consistently visually sumptuous work. Similarly, the film's 1950s costumes, props and locations are similarly laudable (and Gilliam influenced), blending period realism with fantastic, dystopian touches, leading to an impressively envisioned outcome.Tim Robbins gives a delightfully madcap performance as Norville Barnes, the earnest corporate cog consistently bewildered through his struggle to keep up with the inexhaustible machine he has found himself swept up by. Robbins perfectly essays the spirit of the film, always silly and irreverent enough to raise a laugh, but with just enough pathos to incur moments of thoughtful reflection when necessary - a masterful comedic feat. Paul Newman is an instant classic as Sidney J. Mussburger, the gravely voiced, machiavellian corporate shark willing to dispose of any possible obstacle, human or otherwise. Newman launches himself into the role with a particular shameless vindictive glee, and few boss from hell performances have proved so hysterically memorable or enjoyable. Jennifer Jason Leigh is flooring as an ambitious reporter attempting to get the goods on Barnes - her continual machine gun delivery of lines rattling off at breakneck speed without missing a beat is jaw dropping, while she also fills the character with exactly the right quantity of muted warmth. John Mahoney similarly raises many a laugh as Leigh's newspaper's fast talking editor, willing to do anything for a splashy headline, and Charles Durning is consistently hilarious given his moments to shine as Waring Hudsucker, whose suicide incites Barnes' promotion to president. Bruce Campbell is also a wonderful presence as a sleazy reporter, his tremendous charisma making the most out of a tiny role, as does Steve Buscemi in an amusing cameo as a beatnik bartender.Deliriously funny, quirkily chaotic but always with a firm sense of directorial intent and control, The Hudsucker Proxy proves one of the Coen brothers' most inventive, subversive and stylistically enjoyable feats. While the final act will inevitably divide audiences, the sheer volume of innovation and coy blending of influences on display is enough to cheerfully carry the film through its few such storyline quivers. For any fans of the Coens, the film should be considered a must see, and for anyone unfamiliar with their eclectic body of work but seeking an offbeat, intelligent and masterfully crafted comedy, such a gem of a film should prove just the thing - you know, for kids!. -9/10 "},{"Title":"The Hudsucker Proxy is an astounding example of film making at it's finest","Date":"5 February 2005","Score":"3 out of 3 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Fantasy","Review":" The Coen Brothers' Hudsucker Proxy is an obvious tribute to many of the 30's and 40's era comedy/noir films which inspired them as film makers, yet still manages to succeed in standing alone as an original work of art.I'm sure if this film weren't so directly correlated with comedy, it would be much more highly respected, however, most film connoisseurs seem to unreasonably look down on comedy films. Hudsucker Proxy isn't just a comedy. To some it could be considered epic considering it's grand visual elements, and Greek form of storytelling.

I think I'm a pretty smart guy; but I submit that a monkey sitting at a keyboard could type out a manuscript for Hamlet in its entirety before I could ever come up with a movie as good as this one.  esh.  The extent & limitations of my talents, compared to that of the Coens (or anyone else, for that matter), quite frankly depress me.The video box for this movie should have consisted of plain brown paper, instead of what it does consist of.  The cover gives away the significance of the circle with which Robbins' character is obsessed for the first hour or so of the movie.  When I rented it, I either didn't notice before I took it from the shelf, or I merely forgot after I left the store, what was on the cover of the box.  This turned out to be a blessing, because it was all such good fun trying to figger out why Robbins was so obsessed with it! The casting was, as is typical of the Coens' movies, superb.  Having Robbins play the role of Norville Barnes would not have occurred to me. However, he pulls it off magnificently.  (I guess this is why I'm counting beans here in Winnipeg, Canada instead of making my mark on Hollywood.) Jennifer Jason Leigh's Amy Archer is wonderful.  Her accent/dialect is perhaps somewhat exaggerated, but none-the-less enjoyable.  The Pulitzer Prize scene is a standout, in my opinion.  Paul Newman plays the role of the nefarious Sidney Mussburger with a twinkle in his eye & his tongue in his cheek.  We get the feeling that he is quite aware of the camera, but unlike Mel Gibson who is also always aware of the camera, Newman is still convincing.  The movie would have been much worse off without him. The They dock ya! scene near the beginning of the movie is great. Robbins plays it for all it's worth.  Simply brilliant.  The scene wherein the steel ball stops in motion is also brilliant in its simplicity & effective in its portent.  I swear, only the Coens could conceive of it. And the preceding scene with the water bottle & trash can fire pays homage to Marx Brothers slapstick; again, Newman & Robbins are superb.  I howled with laughter. The Hudsucker Proxy is devoid of sex, profanity, drugs, car chases & explosions.  Definitely NOT mainstream Hollywood.  It has a kind-of Gotham City feel to it, a la Batman.  IMDb indicates its genre to be Comedy/Romance/Fantasy.  I think this, while not important, is misleading. The element of romance is weak.  And to suggest that it is fantasy is dubious, because most of what happens in the movie is plausible, except for a few scenes. Roger was, in this scribe's opinion, a little too harsh on it He gives it only two stars.  Yet he says This is the best-looking movie I've seen in years, a feast for the eyes and the imagination.  The art direction and set design are breathtaking, re-creating the world of 1930s screwball comedy in which towering skyscrapers and vast boardrooms were the playing fields for the ambitions of corrupt executives, ambitious kids, unsung geniuses, and lady newspaper reporters with nails as sharp as their wisecracks.  Huh? That hardly sounds like the preamble to a two-star movie review.  I think he should watch it again, maybe when he's in a better mood. What more could you expect from a comedy/faux drama?!  The only present I wanted for Christmas '02 was The Hudsucker Proxy on DVD & my girlfriend had to search high & low in my home town to find it, but find it she did. It's amazing, the s**t you can find on DVD these days.  But trying to find a modern masterpiece is a crap shoot.  It makes you wonder about how fickle the consumer is & how unimaginative some movie studio executives are. This movie is crammed with pearls & I could go on & on describing the smorgasbord of wonderful scenes in this movie.  Just rent it & learn for yourself what a great movie this is.

Tim Robbins has rarely been better and provides a worthy successor to the clueless but ultimately endearing Capra heroes of the 30's, like Gary Cooper and Jimmy Stewart. Jennifer Jason Leigh, who has been so good in many movies, provides a winning cross between the professionalism of Rosalind Russel's character in His Girl Friday and the archetypal Katherine Hepburn character (she even gets the voice right!). Paul Newman makes an ideal villain, and Charles Durning has a memorable cameo. The cast is not even the best part. The movie is visually stunning (where were the cinematography and art direction oscars on this one?) and adds all the more to the storyline. The direction flawlessly invokes the madcap comedies of the 30's with a plot that is heavily influenced by Sturges and Capra but has some now-typical Coen twists in it as well. However, the best part is the screenplay. A true american original, it exceeds especially with the hula-hoop plotline. This movie flopped in' 94, but hey--so did Vertigo in '58 and The Magnificent Ambersons in '42. Some genius takes time to be appreciated--lets hope time appreciates this true Coen masterpiece.

What is it?Take the sets from the Batman movie, let a comic book be your guide for dialogue, and cast Tim Robbins (what's not to like?) as your naive leading man; let Jennifer Jason Leigh do an imitation of young Kate Hepburn while using the body language of the young Barbara Stanwyck.  What could be wrong with that?  Oh, and add a very short Paul Newman (they should never let him stand next to Tim Robbins), Yes, yes, he says, and flicks his major cigar, doing a passable Groucho.Look, I loved the movies of the thirties and forties with Jimmy Stewart or Gary Cooper playing the honest (if simple) common man who wants to make good.  It's a familiar plot -bring him to Town from Hicksville, pit him against the most cynical business world possible (this is sometimes a political scenario). Meet him up with the sharp-as-a-whip Career Woman (usually an undercover reporter out to get the Scoop).  He realizes, too late,that he has told her his hopes and dreams with an open heart, and all the while she has been sticking the knife to him.  She realizes, nearly too late, that she is in love; it rolls downhill, with delicious suspense, sometimes a full five minutes of conflict that seem like forever before the clinch  and the closing credits roll.It could have worked (it's worked before), but nobody here cared about the characters. The writer, the director - one assumes they conspired, the brothers Coen, as they have in the past.  Who to blame?  No matter.  We are left with caricatures, badly presented and badly treated.  The Tim Robbins character IS an imbecile; he has no original likability for us to return to; we do not know him and so we do not root for him. Tim Robbins' natural charm is inclined to buffoonery, and so he needs a script,and some (dare I say it?) direction). He can act, you just need to give him some clues. When one moment of true feeling, of human contact, occurs, it is because Jennifer Jason Leigh makes it happen, working against bad dialogue and somebody's misconceived Bryn Mawr accent.  I like her, she keeps trying new things, but unfortunately, curiosity value does not a movie make.I pay my dollar, I expect to be entertained. If this is a comedy, it isn't funny.

It's such a raucous explosion of absurd and hyperactive characters in surreal, cartoonish synergy I couldn't take my eyes away the entire time. Such is always the case with Coen fare, and I should have expected to be wowed, but every time I see a new film of their's I'm flabbergasted like its the first time discovering their work. Such is their magic; they're a once in a universe creative force that you either get, or you don't. If you aren't already cursed (or blessed, depending on how you look at it) with a really bizarre, abstract sense of humour, then chances are you just won't tune in to their wavelength and be as tickled as hardcore fans. They just have such a wall to wall comedic gold within every screenplay they tackle, a willingness to sit down with the weird, exaggerated side of life and find the uproarious elements in the most mundane of exchanges. Here we see them take on bustling late 50's New York, particularly the cutthroat corporate arena. This is also another chance to display their trademark attention to gorgeous production design and urges to poke fun at the cultural idiosyncrasies of whichever time period they are dwelling on, adding all the more personality to the piece. The ancient Waring Hudsucker (Charles Durning, making compelling work of a silent, puzzling cameo) CEO of mammoth Hudsucker Industries, has hurled himself through the boardroom window, plummeting forty four stories to the pavement below, leaving the throne vacant and prompting his vulture shareholders to circle the monarchy. Second in command Sydney J. Mussburger (Paul Newman, eagle eyed, growling evil in every frame), sets his mind to hiring an utter imbecile to run the shares into the ground, in order to prevent the stocks from going public, a ditch effort of spectacular greed. Enter Norville Barnes (Tim Robbins), a naive small town boy, shunted up from the mailroom straight into Mussburger's awaiting paws, and from there into the CEO's seat. Things look well for the scheme, until Barnes, an opportunistic golden boy, unwittingly invents the newest thing, the... well I won't spoil it for you. When the J. Jonah Jameson of 1950's New York (a rabid John Mahoney, always at the top of his game in Coen land) sends his top reporter, Amy Archer (Jennifer Jason Leigh) to snoop out the company's new 'idea man' CEO, things get wild and weird in true Coen fashion. Leigh is an actress of uncanny ability. In this film, everything is cardboard cutout, cartoonish and emotionally detached, the characters mere cogs in the hyper- real story as opposed to feeling, human people. Leigh most of all is a blustery, shameless stereotype of the mile a minute speech patterned gal that everyone's image of the 50's is like, and in a film full of pseudo real characters, she's the craziest. What amazes me is that even through that sheen of period gloss and chortling melodrama, she's still able to be the only performer to convey any emotion through her work! And emotion she shows, giving poignant little moments that the film hardly has time to acknowledge, but are there for the viewer's discovery all the same! Talk about a paradox. Such is Leigh's unequalled talent though, which I've been preaching for years, and which looks like will get a fresh track to run on with Quentin Tarantino's upcoming The Hateful Eight, and the much anticipated new Twin Peaks season. Just a consummate actress and a delight to behold in anything. This film is one of the most 'Coen' Coen Brothers flicks I've ever seen, and I'm surprised it took me so long to give it a watch. It's got deliberately over the top, quirky people, relentless social and class satire, zany screwball elements and overall, intangible charm that only they can bring us. I've always thought that the energy you get in a Coen Brothers film is so insane and unique that it's equal to those moments on the night before Christmas, a minute before 12am on New Year's Eve, or when the entire neighbourhood wakes up and trundles outside to see why there's ten ambulances down the block, maybe the final seconds of hesitation before taking a risky lakeside cliff jump; there's a palpable dose of giddy adrenaline and undefinable, primal strangeness to anything they produce, a lightning in a bottle, one in a million quality that I've only ever felt with one other filmmaker, David Lynch. Suffice to say, never a dull moment in Coen land. There's an epic supporting cast including Mike Starr, Peter Gallagher, Bruce Campbell (Sam Raimi is a co writer, bless his heart;)), Jon Polito, Bill Cobbs, Joe Grifasi, Noble Willingham, Anna Nicole Smith, John Goodman, Richard Schiff and Steve Buscemi. Fanatics and film lovers alike owe it to themselves to take a trip to this utterly nutty, deliriously stylish, endlessly funny province of Coen land, a place where you never quite know what you're going to get, never quite know what you've just watched when the credits roll, but always know you've had a good, funny bone and brain stimulating time at the movies.

Okay, so the Coen brothers had pitched it as an homage to Frank Capra (you, know it's superficially similar to It's a Wonderful Life in places) and the few people who bothered to see the movie in theaters were appalled to see it was anything but. Then again, why expect something conventional from the Coens? The Hudsucker Proxy is a lot like their other films clever, unpredictable and occasionally downright insane. Three good reasons for a re-evaluation.The brothers' first proper comedy since Raising Arizona (though some argue Barton Fink qualifies as humor of the darkest kind) opens on a typically (for them, that is) sad note Waring Hudsucker (Charles Durning), head of Hudsucker Industries, decides to take his own life right in the middle of a board meeting and does so by running across the table and jumping out of the window. At this point, the company votes to replace him with a real doofus so that they can get away with an industrial scam. Therefore, while the idiotic Norville Barnes (Tim Robbins) is left in charge of Hudsucker, the manipulative Sydney J. Mussburger (Paul Newman) is actually pulling the strings. It all goes well until a fast-talking reporter (Jennifer Lason Leigh) decides to uncover the truth about what's going on.Leigh's character is obviously modeled after the female protagonist of His Girl Friday, seemingly confirming the Coens' intention to revisit the screwball comedy genre. And even if the scenes where she deals with her narrow-minded male colleagues (John Mahoney and Bruce Campbell - always a welcome presence) are, without a doubt, hilarious, there is very little to laugh about in The Hudsucker Proxy, at least in terms of immediate reactions. On paper, this might look like a broad, traditional comedy; in reality, it's an ingenious satire on industrial society, owing more to Gilliam's Brazil than anything by Capra or Hawks. Sure, it's less creepy and surreal (to a degree) than Gilliam's masterpiece, but the intent and sharpness is a match.Furthermore, this film can be seen as a lighter companion piece to Barton Fink and its reflections on Hollywood. Of course, the Coens are too clever to openly show that, but the film's most successful joke is that before Norville, played by an endearingly dim-looking Robbins, comes up with the famous hoola hoop (You know, for kids!) there's no mention of what Hudsucker produces. It's industry for its own sake, much like those film studios who deliver empty products favoring business over art. And what is Newman's character if not a God-like film producer/studio head, a cynical version of Harvey Weinstein, Jerry Bruckheimer or Joel Silver (who coincidentally produced the movie), handing the job to talentless people for profit's sake?Granted, most people didn't get that the first time around, but that's no reason for damning a film; on the contrary, such a strong metaphorical resonance ought to be revisited, again and again. How is it possible not to love such an accomplishment? "},{"Title":"Well I'm for it!

It pops like a firecracker, word after word exploding in a stream of nearly indecipherable metaphors and one liners. It could be really terrible if the actors mumbled at all, or if the editors didn't capture each syllable distinctly, but none fail (or fall) and it has the most unique dialogue I can remember in a film.

Not many modern actors could deal with the script requirements, and they all do a brilliant job, Leigh in particular somehow fuses her modernity with the mannerisms of the past great actresses in a way that still seems heartfelt.I am continually amazed by the Coen's generosity and inventiveness, and while some critics may say they steal to the past filmmakers disadvantage, I heartily disagree, as I can only walk away from this film with a smile on my face, whereas I want to grimace at It's A Wonderful Life.A great film worth your time.

THere's always a 'wicked' blend of clever writing, mayhem, noir and the Coens' uncanny sense of dark humour. And thanks to their frequent collaborators like cinematographer Roger Deakins, you can always expect a work of impecable quality. Yet that seem to be problem, because of all the good films that they have made, despite their individual merits, none of them seem to stand out on it's own.THat is untill I came accross 'The Hudsucker Proxy'. I can't agree more with other reviewers who feel that this is an underrated film. And the film's title, though relevant to the film itself, doesn't strike as a piece that you'll wanna check out, unless you are a Coens' fan.Coming to the film itself, despite the 'impecable quality' that I've seen in previous Coens', I was nonetheless astonished by the 'look' of it. From the opening alone, with the almost surreal recreation of New York 1958, the very beautiful and communicating cinematography that goes very well with the design, for the lack of a better word, I can only say it's 'Magical'.Many scenes really stand out and demanded attention, and that includes the two-cops conversant narration of the 'entry' of Jennifer Jason Leigh's character first meeting Tim Robin's Norville Barnes...the two cops serve as a metaphor to the two Coen Brothers writing the scene itself.ANd this leads to the main point I'm about to make - This film is made up of classical screwball references, namely the films of Preston Sturges and Frank Capra. The above-mentioned scene is already evident as a Sturges' style in 'Lady Eve. The plot, characters, ideas and execution are taken from Sturges and Capra. A intelligent 'Puilitzer' and conniving Amy Archer falling in love with the imbecile but 'rich' with a heart Norville Barnes - once again it's Lady Eve. The sucidal Barnes who got rescued by angels during Christmas/ NEw YEar Merry season - Capra's It's a Wonderful Life. An innocent and naive man from small time town making BIG TIME by a twist of fate, with a twist of irony, and bucking the system - Mr SMith goes to WashingtonAdd in some biting satire that includes feminism and cut-throat corporate life to the screwball adn Capraism, and you'll have this new blend from the Coen brothers...something different from what I coined as 'Coenism noir', and still very good and satisfying.MY guess is Sam Raimi's contribution in writing credits does add on to the differentiating factors. But nevertheless, this is a Coens' film, and without doubt the best I've seen. As a fellow film buff, I can picture how the brothers are trying to pay a fitting tribute to their idols and the genre. I take my hat off them and maybe someday in the near future, it will be the Coen brothers turn to be placed on the pedestal.9/10 from me.

All of them have a higher level of comedic film-making which is unsurpassed by any other director/screenwriter today. The Hudsucker Proxy is the pinnacle of their comedy achievements. It presents us with a exaggerated view of the 1950's business world and media. With the fast talking characters by John Mahoney and Jennifer Jason Leigh, we cannot help but laugh out loud at how stereotypical they seem to be. Let us also admire Tim Robbins, in probably his best performance to date, as the idealistic (and dimwitted) mail room boy who becomes the unlikely president of the company on his first day. And of course, who can forget the brilliant villainy brought to the screen by our favorite Paul Newman. With beautiful set direction, out of this world designs (like Robbins' fresh idea, you know, for kids), this film deserves more praise than it has been given. If you are just getting into the Coen brothers' collection, this is easily one of the top three which is a must see (the other two being Fargo and O Brother, Where Art Thou?). Let's also note that J.K. Simmons' portrayal of J. Jonah Jameson in Spider-Man (2001) was clearly inspired by John Mahoney portrayal of the editor in chief in this movie (Sam Raimi, who directed Spider-Man, co-wrote this film with the Coens).

Basically I saw this movie, due to a befriendment of a mature student, who was an avid movie fan. He was quite amazed and pleased that I had a good knowledge of movies and yet completely flummoxed that I have not seen Hudsucker Proxy, (A major favourite of his). To cut a long story short, I watched this movie with the knowledge of Coen Brothers only consisting of Fargo and Big Lebowski. So I was hoping character based stories, with great lines and some beautiful scenery and I was not disappointed. POSSIBLE SPOILERS AHEADThe movie starts of with a suicide committed by a CEO of Hudsucker Industries. This leaves money grabbing egotistical businessman, Sidney Mussberger to take over. He has a brilliant plan to make loads and loads of money. He wants to get an idiot to become president of the company, making the prices of the shares to down, causing a domino effect in the stock exchange, and therefore the shares can be obtained in a very low price. He appoints Norville Barnes, a mailroom worker who has aspirations to make it big in the world with his simple idea of a circle. Barnes' ideas has made the creditability of the company go down. It looks like Mussberger plans are going to work, yet the intervention of the circle idea comes into play and seems to make more and more money for the company. In the midst of this as well, a pushy investigative journalist believes that something is not quite right in Hudsucker Industries and goes and finds out about it.This movie has been shot to perfection. The lighting and scenery makes you feel that you are transported to the 1950's. The costumes looked like pure authenticity. The actors are brilliant in the roles; from Tim Robbins happy go lucky role as Norville Banks to Paul Newman's role of the money hungry wicked boss Sidney Mussberger. Jennifer Jason Leigh's role was very good as Amy Archer, yet it seemed like she was over acting a little bit and also her character's voice was grating to the ears. I do believe that she was trying to recreate the role of Rosalind Russell in `His Girl Friday'.This should lead me to my other point, that the Coen brothers made this movie to pay homage to the golden age of cinema during the 1950's, yet in their own style. Those who like feel-good movies where the everyman person wins at the end should enjoy this movie. However it should not just become limited to only those people. It should be watched by anyone who actually likes movies in general, and to see a different side to the Coen Brother's eclectic directing and writing.

The biting script, the satire on corporate power, the fast-paced, 50s, art deco feel, the symoblism all combine to make an unforgettable experience.Many say this film's publicity problem was its title, claiming the public didn't know what it meant until they saw it and that it just sounded like a weird title for a film.  To these I pose a question  Without seeing the film, who knows what Raising Arizona means?  What about Fargo?  The Big Lebowski?  Barton Fink?  Even O Brother, Where Art Thou is ambiguous as to what the film's really about.  Even non-Coen films' titles can be confusing without seeing the film  The Green Mile, The Hours, Far from Heaven, etc.  No no, I blame this film's tragic and undeserved lack of success on less publicity and possibly poor timing, releasing it alongside bigger titles.All in all, a spectacular film.

But the only film I had never seen from them after all these years was The Hudsucker Proxy. Unfortunately for me, I wish I had seen this much earlier. I thought it was very clever, and I'm surprised Jennifer Jason Leigh wasn't nominated for her role. As someone earlier noted, I thought this performance was more in homage to Katherine Hepburn than Rosalind Russell (as one of the bullets in the Trivia section noted that Leigh was given Russell as her inspiration). Sure, Russell's role in His Girl Friday might have been the inspiration, but accent, mannerisms, delivery of lines etc. is definitely more Hepburn than Russell. Or should I say more like Cate Blanchett from The Aviator? Finally, I felt I needed to comment on Mr. Moo's message on June 24, 2004, where he says, among other things, In the beginning, there were silent films. Charlie Chaplin made some, and generally speaking, they were rubbish. That is perhaps one of the dumbest comments I've ever seen made on an IMDb board.

I had never seen populist films like the ones Frank Capra satirized so well since Preston Sturges did it in his golden years at Paramount. But Sturges was hemmed in by the Code and the Coens had far more freedom of expression to act. The reason that this film is set in an idealized version of the Fifties so that a popular fad of a simple product could be worked into the plot as an integral part of the story line. With no more worlds to conquer after a report that his company Hudsucker Industries is richer than ever, President and founder Charles Durning takes a running start out of the board meeting and plunges 44 stories to his demise. A spectacular exit to say the least.But it's left the board who are just yes men with a real problem. Durning owned 87% of the stock so his word was law. And his will specified within 30 days that 87% was to be put on the open market and sold to any and all on the Stock Exchange. That leaves these guys in a real jam.But second in command Paul Newman has a Capra villain solution to the problem. Find the biggest schnook around and make him president and then the market will lose confidence and the stock value will crash and the inside boys can buy it up dirt cheap. The schnook Newman finds works in the mail-room at Hudsucker Industries, new employee Tim Robbins who's newly arrived from the Muncie Indiana College of Business.Newman looks like he's having a great old time playing Sidney J. Musberger in the role Douglass Dumbrille would have had in those old Capra Films. Tim Robbins is the innocent Gary Cooper/Jimmy Stewart type Capra hero. Robbins is great, but if this had been done thirty years earlier Jerry Lewis would have been perfect casting. I'm sure if Jerry saw the film he'd think so too.Playing the Jean Arthur/Barbara Stanwyck is Jennifer Jason Leigh who is appropriately a snoop and scoop Lois Lane reporter. But who could not resist a charming oaf as Robbins is? Robbins does happen to invent a popular Fifties fad and Newman's plans are foiled, but eventually get back on track. If you are fans of those Frank Capra classics you know how this all turns out though the Coen Brothers used another popular fantasy film Stairway To Heaven for a surrealistic type ending.I think the chance to see Paul Newman get a great comedy part like he finally did in Slap Shot and do some great work with it is reason enough to see The Hudsucker Proxy.

It's well liked today, but was a disaster when it opened, grossing less than $3 million domestic on a budget of around $25 million. It also didn't do that well critically. It's not hard to see why. It's a film of all style and no substance. It's often easy to get lost in its labyrinthine production design and forget about the rather forgettable characters. Not to mention that it has the most forehead-slapping deus ex machina outside of Greek tragedy. Oh how I wish the Coens and co-writer Sam Raimi would have re-read the script one last time and realized how poor that whole climactic sequence really was. The characters may not be as interesting as they are in any of their other films, but they deserve better than that. Despite its massive flaws, I must say that The Hudsucker Proxy is so extremely enjoyable that it's pretty close to impossible to dislike. I for one enjoy getting lost in the art deco New York City the Coens have created. And there's something magical in the clockwork way the film runs, the mechanical dialogue and editing. It's strange, and it's not always successful, but it's so wholly original that I have a lot of affection for the picture. "},{"Title":"The Einstein of Enterprise. The Edison of Industry.

An employee has just finished reporting that profits are way up and that they are now loaded. Suddenly, Hudsucker (Charles Durning) clears his throat, stands on top of the table and dashes down its length, hurling himself through the glass window ahead. In the fast-paced, hustle-and-bustle world of 1950s New York, there is something almost beautiful about the man's extended descent to earth. We follow him as he falls, and observe the look of pure exhilaration upon his face.Just seconds after the esteemed Hudsucker strikes the pavement, most of the board members have already overcome their grief, moving on to address more important matters. Why did he do it? Maybe the man was unhappy. Why didn't he just open the window first? Waring Hudsucker never did anything the easy way. They bicker over how many floors the man plummeted 44, but 45 if you include the mezzanine. Sidney J. Mussburger (Paul Newman, Road to Perdition) confidently rises to his feet, informing his colleagues that Hudsucker's entire portfolio &#150; 87% of the company stock &#150; will be converted into common stock and sold over the counter on January 1, in one month's time. In order for them to buy this stock themselves, they must beat down the stock price as much as possible. They intend to do this by hiring a moronic pawn as President &#150; Some jerk we can really push around.Meanwhile, an enthusiastic young Muncie graduate, Norville Barnes (Tim Robbins, 'The Shawshank Redemption'), arrives in New York to make his fortune. However, having no experience, the only job he can get is in the mail room at Hudsucker Industries. When he is recruited to deliver an all-important Blue Letter to Mussburger, Barnes tries to propose his brilliant new idea for a kid's toy (signified by a perfect circle drawn on a piece of paper), before setting Mussburger's office on fire and nearly sending him out of a 44th storey window (or 45th, if you include the mezzanine). Having found his moronic pawn, Mussburger appoints Barnes the newest President of Hudsucker Industries.Joel and Ethan Coen are two writers known for their snappy, quick-witted dialogue, and here is no exception. Jennifer Jason Leigh's character, Amy Archer, a Pulitzer-prize winning journalist for the Manhattan Argus, is the perfect caricature of a fast-talking, no-nonsense reporter of the era, spewing forth dialogue more rapidly than you could possibly register it. Tim Robbins is the likable, if a bit dim-witted, ambitious young man who is eventually consumed by his unexpected success. Paul Newman is the masterfully cruel and sleazy company executive who finds his well-laid plans crumbling beneath him. 'The Hudsucker Proxy' is yet another weird and wacky screwball comedy from the Coen Brothers, and an enjoyable addition to their cinematic palette.

Instead of Nic Cage trying to be funny and falling flat, we get Robbins who lives in a world outside the movie.  Cage wouldn't catch on to this until 'Matchstick Men'.

When Waring Hudsucker (Charles Durning), founder and president of Hudsucker Industries, inexplicably hurls himself from the 44th floor of his wildly successful company, the fatcats in the boardroom are faced with a dilemma because Mr. Hudsucker has no heirs, the company will go public on the next January 1. Unable to collectively procure the high-priced stock themselves and thus losing controlling interest, a fiendish plan is devised by company Vice President Sidney J.

Mussburger encounters a new challenge &#x96; how to rid Hudsucker Industries of Norville, its new shining star. Visually eye-filling and impressive, when 'Hudsucker Proxy' is working, it's laugh-out-loud funny, which is much of the time. Tim Robbins brings great warmth and gentle naivet√© to his role as Barnes; on the flip side is Jennifer Jason Leigh as the Pulitzer-winning reporter who ultimately falls for Norville, affecting a poor, ill-conceived imitation of Katherine Hepburn, ultimately coming off as shrill and unlikable.

The bullet fast dialogue is unfunny and not as clever as it tried to be. Every single shot and dialogue is overdone to a point that it becomes unwatchable. This film feels like a parody sketch on a comedy show or a children's film.Tim Robbins and Paul Newman did a pretty good job (as usual). But Jennifer Jason Leigh's character is more annoying then nails on a chalkboard. Surely she has got to be one of the most irritating movie characters that I have ever seen. Every time she was on the screen I felt like shooting my TV screen. Her portrayal of a fast talking career women who thinks she is one of the boys is painfully unfunny and simply stupid.

The film is so incongruously appealing that I feel my review should match the same level of creativeness and wonder it brought on the screen. But seriously, what more can I say about the Coen brothers' The Hudsucker Proxy that it's one of the best-looking comedies ever. There are many moments in the film, (in fact, quite every time) where I felt myself wondering if I had to keep track on the story or my eyes on the dazzling looks it offered from the beautiful panoramic shots of majestic and creepy Babel-Tower like skyscrapers or the sumptuous recreation of the Big Corporations' inside rooms with never-ending tables as vertiginous as the buildings, from a horizontal perspective. Roger Deakins' geometric cinematography is absolutely breath-taking and rather than being put for the only 'eye-pleasing' purpose, works as the setting of some spectacular scenes.The most notable one is the opening where the respected President, Waring Hudsucker, played by the late Charles Durning, decides to make the big dive, fed up of all that business mumbo-jumbo he had to endure his all life. That long jump and long is an understatement (Hudsucker even finds time to tell people on the ground to move away), is weirdly convincing and hilarious through the anticlimactic slap at the end, the obligatory fat-ugly woman screaming and the verbal aftermath carried by heartless board members and their ruthless leader, Sidney Mussburger, played by Paul Newman. The jump scene sums up the film's appeal it looks great and makes you laugh. And naturally, if you're a fan of Frank Capra's classics where greedy corporate businessman use a naive and idealistic schmuck to fulfill some evil schemes, and all the subsequent archetypes spinning closes-up on newspapers headlines, nosy and noisy journalists and the snappy wisecracking workaholic female who'll get infatuated on the goodhearted fool she investigates on (Tim Robbins is perfect as the well-meaning Norville Barnes), comic-reliefs sidekicks and all that stuff, well, if you look at Hollywood Golden Age with nostalgic eyes, The Hudsucker Proxy will be familiar territory for you. And that Capraesque touch clearly helps to appreciate the film.Indeed, that half-homage and half-parody approach constitutes a solid platform on which the improbability of the story can efficiently evolve. And for some strange reasons, to which the Coen brothers only know the secret, each actor, by playing his character in the required over-the-top way, gave them that touch of believability for the film's bizarre poetry. I concede it takes time to get into some characters, I for once, thought Jennifer Lason Leigh was unbearable as the journalist, now, I can't see how her performance could have worked differently. The point is not that she impersonated Katharine Hepburn or Rosalind Russell well or badly, but that she was 'impersonating'. It's a film firmly aware of its 'cinematicality'.Naturally, the film isn't beyond criticism for all that. Many would argue that its very attention to great designs and magnificent looking details give a touch of seriousness inducing more serious expectations regarding the plot. My agreement with Ebert concerns the way the poster spoiled what would have been one hell of a middle-plot twist. I'm talking of course of the circle that would be revealed as the hula-hoop. That basic circle, Norville Barnes showed to everyone, adding the repeated line You know, for kids as if it was supposed to give a clue, could have been the film's McGuffin since it's the very device that triggers Mussburger's desire to hire Barnes as the proxy, in order to depress the stock and buys all the company's interests, but what a great surprise it would have been to have that revealed in the middle of the film.Apart from that missed opportunity, the film works and never leaves any hint of a dramatic evolution of the story. And when drama, there is, it only plays as set-ups from some screwball situations, the opening with Norville Barnes trying to jump from the Hudsucker's high clock is a reminiscence of John Doe's character (Gary Cooper) in Meet John Doe, but I defy anyone to claim that he saw the resolution coming. Not to say that it would satisfy all the viewers, but still, it fits the film's surrealistic touch to the film, with all flash and style, but not without substance. Granted The Hudsucker Proxy isn't Metropolis, The Crowd or Brazil but by its stylistic recreation of these iconic setting, leverage our thoughts to the more satirical material. Maybe it's too far-fetched, but I didn't think the film needed to speak explicit statement against savage capitalism; the point is smoothly made without distracting from the slapstick and screwball material. The assumption of 'all flash and no substance' isn't totally irrelevant but with such flashy brilliance and such great dialogs, the film can't be branded as unsubstantial. It's classy, surrealist, and funny and much more, it succeeds to put all these qualities together, something a few films can pretend to achieve. And on a more basic level, the film is so damn funny. I laughed, I laughed a lot. Maybe not as much as in the first act, but the laughs were equally combined with true satire and a dazzling photography, served by superb performances.The film works both on the surface and its content. I wish I could say more, I wish my vocabulary would be richer, but all I can do is summarize the film by paraphrasing its repeated line you know, for laughs That's what it is, a movie made for laughs, and the rest is just a delightful cinematic experience, something fresh made out of familiar material. Basically, the Coen brothers did the same than Norville Barnes they reinvented the wheel.

With no working experience, he found himself working at the mailroom of the Hudsucker Industries. On the same day, the company's founder and president Waring Hudsucker (Charles Durning) unexpectedly committed suicide by jumping off from the top-floor window despite the company had been doing well financially.Back at the mailroom, there is the arrival of the 'Blue Letter' which Barnes had been assigned to hand it personally to Sidney J. Mussburger (Paul Newman), a member of the board of directors. When Barnes did eventually meet Mussburger, he would forget about the letter he was supposed to deliver and began talking about the new invention he had for the company. Mussburger would eventually decide to let Barnes become the replacement for Hudsucker, acting as the proxy where the company's stock would deflate at the appointment of an inexperienced and incompetent president.Across town, Amy Archer (Jennifer Jason Leigh), the Pulitzer Prize- winning journalist for the Manhattan Argus had successfully gone undercover working as a personal secretary for Barnes, pretending to be another desperate graduate from Muncie. In actual fact, she was assigned to do a profile of Barnes. Along the way, she would come to see how Barnes had been transformed as a person after his idea of the hula hoop take off across the country, going against what Mussburger and the board had thought the invention would depress the company stock.This can be seen as a film of about reversal of fortunes, of how Barnes went from the mailroom clerk to the company president and how he nearly went back to how it all started for him before being saved by an unlikely source. It is what would happen towards the ending which brings one full circle of what happened at the beginning of the film.Overall, it is a fairly enjoyable film, if one likes to root for the underdog which in this case is Barnes with the exception of what happened when the hula hoop invention changed his fortune.

A futuristic surrealism is a tentative stab for Coen brothers but a diverting treat for their fanboys. The free-falling scenes are devastatingly jaw-dropping and the time- stopping clock backdrop is a brilliant tactic. About the cast, what a stroke of luch to be a post-graduate rookie at the age of 35 both physically and mentally. Tim Robbins' chubby baby-face does the magic like the hoola-hoop does to the Hudsucker enterprise in the film!

Tim Robbins plays the wide-eyed rube, Norville Barnes, to a tee. Paul Newman's evil Sydney Mussburger is a capitalist-baiting treasure as he leads his bumbling board in a twisted ruse. As befits the Coen's allegorical style, every character is over the top both in personality and plot relevance. But the most perfectly played role in this film of great roles belongs to Jennifer Jason Leigh as a fast talking news reporter out to expose the Hudsucker scam. It takes a little bit of viewer effort to keep up with her, but you know it's clearly worth it from the moment she takes command of the scene.The deliberate, baritone narration and the evocative, enveloping sights and sounds take you back to a vintage era both in film-making and in American life. The Coen brothers use their superb writing skill to give us that bygone era's whiplash banter (think Preston Sturgis) behind that veil of a modern, satiric sensibility that characterizes all of their films. And, of course, they give us a great story.Of the hundreds of movies I have seen, less than a dozen merit a perfect 10 from me. In the interest of full disclosure, the Coen brothers merit three of them, so you can see my bias toward that combination of great writing, transporting cinematography, perfect acting, and the kind of music that could easily stand alone as a luscious orchestral event, yet fits perfectly in the movie for which it was scored.

Part affectionate homage to the fast-talking movies of the 1940s (most notably 'His Girl Friday'), part playful satire on the cutthroat worlds of business and media, and a winning, immensely enjoyable metropolitan fantasy all-over, I fell in love with every single aspect of 'the Hudsucker Proxy' when I first came across it, and subsequent viewings have only left me even more convinced that I'll never be able to say enough good things about it. Certainly, there isn't a bad word to be said &#150; with its ingenious set-up, lovable hero, ravishing scenery and breath-taking score, this is a buried treasure trove of a production, well-worth digging out. The film-making siblings are as keen here as ever to demonstrate their knack for fusing the macabre with the mirthful, with an impressive 44-storey suicide leap forming one of the earliest scenes (and it is expertly done, so as to feel sad, horrific and, thanks to the reactions from various onlookers, hysterical all at once) but on the whole I'd say this rates as the most whimsical, even magical, of their efforts thus far, playing almost like their personalised take on the films of Frank Capra. It's warped, wacky and unorthodox, with their trademark Coen anarchy written all over it, but with genuine warmth and feel-goodness always nuzzling at the centre. The blend is so perfect, and with so much on offer for everyone, I have no idea why this movie has had so much trouble, since its neglected release, achieving the mass appeal it was built for.Far removed from the disquieting grittiness of 'Fargo' and 'Blood Simple' (the two Coen flicks which, incidentally, would be right up there with this one in my Top 3 list of all their output, so you know my tastes are assorted), not only is it brilliantly comical and laugh-out-loud hilarious on a consistent level, it also tells a charming and irresistible underdog tale in its most basic and effective form. Tim Robbins is at his topmost endearing (very, very high indeed) as Norville Barnes, the naive young business school graduate who makes up for what he lacks in canniness with bright ideas and guileless innocence. Arriving in New York City in the late 1950s with hopes of making it big, only to wind up toiling at the nadir of the occupational food chain in the mail rooms of the aggressive Hudsucker Industries, thanks to sheer fluke in circumstance he finds himself promoted to the top of the company in a matter of hours. There, he gets the chance to live out his personal dream of bringing his revolutionary design for a new children's toy, the 'Hula Hoop' (or, as it could just have easily been branded, the 'Wacky Circumference', amongst other possible monikers) to the world, unaware that it's all just part of a devious stock-holder ploy, and that he's little more than a puppet, or indeed, 'proxy', in the hands of the scheming Paul Newman.At the bare bones, it's the familiar saga of a good-natured man wrestling, if unwittingly, with impersonal corporate greed, the odds stacked firmly to his detriment, but leave it up to the Coens to make that feel refreshing and resourceful. The abundance of clever dialogue and snazzy scenes, in the form of everything from a dream sequence to a vintage news bulletin, to a brief commentary provided on one encounter from a pair of jaded onlookers, keeps things ticking along very smoothly, while Carter Burwell's musical score is a scintillating audio treat, splendidly structured with the on-screen action. The results of this are truly uproarious (try getting through that Hula Hoop production sequence with an entirely straight expression on your face &#150; I swear, it can't be done). But what really brings this movie to life, and one of the key reasons why I've no hesitations to award it full marks, is the sheer pull and appeal of its cast of characters. For all their exaggerated, embellished quirkiness, each and every one of them comes complete with the essential bona fide qualities needed to engage us in the story &#150; the unsuspecting, genial Norville is a charming, fascinating character you can readily warm to, his sneaky but sensitive romantic interest, journalist Amy Archer (a wonderfully dynamic Jennifer Jason Leigh), likewise, while Sidney J. Mussburger is appropriately menacing as well as amusing. They're also complimented by an unforgettable collection of support, including Moses the Clock Guy (who provides intermittent narration and addresses both the audience and the characters alike, a technique which would later be repeated in 'the Big Lebowski'), Buzz the staggeringly voluble elevator boy, a creepy, wordless janitor and, last but not least, a tee-totalling beatnik bartender played by the phenomenal Steve Buscemi (a small role, but worth a mention), all of whom have their own distinctive flavour and sparkle to add to the picture, each helping to make it that extra bit more terrific.To sum up, 'the Hudsucker Proxy' is a comic masterpiece, a laugh-riot that touches, dazzles and delights, and without doubt one of the sharpest movies to come out of the 1990s. And that's something which the general indifference of the movie-going public at the time can never take away from it.

It's hard to know why. This is classic Coen stuff. The basic story is simple, yet appears as a metaphor in every moment. Brilliant cinematography gives it an amazing freshness. And there are a number of interesting side characters such as the elevator guy, the clock guard, the newspaper editor or the first boy using the hoop. Even the large clock becomes personified in Coen's visionary.The allover acting is above average. Tim Robbins is quite good as Barnes. Perhaps it is no match for The Shawshank Redemption but I think it should be counted as one of his top five. Jennifer Jason Leigh is just awesome here. It is no doubt her best performance so far. Her accent just stole the show (Remember the monologue containing 5 Shut up!s before she resigns from Hudsucker Industries?). She brings the classic sensual female character of the fifties into herself. Paul Newman, with his stone-cold personality, is also fabulous.

The Coens work with Roger Deakins all the time, and he makes all their movies look original and beautiful.  This one is no exception.  These guys use tricks from the 20s (and some new stuff they thought up too) and make them work seamlessly.The dialogue absolutely flies.  It pops like a firecracker, word after word exploding in a stream of nearly indecipherable metaphors and one liners. It could be really terrible if the actors mumbled at all, or if the editors didn't capture each syllable distinctly, but none fail (or fall) and it has the most unique dialogue I can remember in a film.  An example of lousy fast talking exists in Miller's Crossing (another Coen Bros. flick).  It's not rampant, but when it pops up, it sucks the character out of the movie.What I really love about this movie, though, is its heart.  Norville Barnes is a lovable character, played lovingly by Tim Robbins.  He fills the screen with sincere, wide-eyed enthusiasm, and he always makes me smile.  I love that he succeeds without losing himself, and I would like to think that I have a little Norville Barnes in myself somewhere.

People are frantically flailing their arms, with their eyes darting across the room, making as many faces as they can. Here we've got the rhyming, giggling bellhop, the wicked man behind-the-scenes, the wide-eyed schmuck, etc., etc.We follow the dough-faced Tim Robbins, the unknowing patsy, on his rise to the top of Hudsucker Industries after an unexpected vacancy leaves a spot open in the company. Paul Newman, with his raspy voice, is spot-on as the man behind-the-scenes. His famous ice blue eyes add to his psychotic, unpredictable nature and he somehow remains dignified throughout the film. There are lots of familiar Coen faces here John Mahoney, as a newspaper editor; Bruce Campbell, as a reporter; Peter Gallagher, as a singer; Steve Buscemi, as a beatnik bartender; and what sounds like John Goodman's voice all make guest appearances.Out of the major actors, Jennifer Jason Leigh, as one of John Mahoney's workers who's sure Robbins is as phony as a three-dollar bill,  is the only one not up to the task. The Coens require their eccentrics to be walking cartoons in a cartoon world -- with faces that look like they've been molded out of Play-Doh -- but Leigh can't tap into their style and as a result, is left behind.One of my complaints with the film is that for a work filled with so many fantastic ideas, they're often not all that surprising. When Charles Durning steps up onto the table, we know what he's about to do, so the suspense is lost (but made up for later). Similarly, many people have noted how much more effective and fun the early part of the story would have been, had the hula hoop not been shown on the film's box cover. In the final part of the movie we have a pretty good idea of what will be Robbins' saving grace as well (but, again, there are some more goodies here). A few of the incidents -- no matter how ridiculous and seemingly inventive -- we somehow see coming.There's no point in even addressing the whole all-style no-substance condemnation the Coens always get -- Fargo is their only movie with a genuine heart. But no one goes to see a Coen movie for an emotional ride anyway, we go for style, cleverness and jokes. It's their most elaborate movie to date, with inflated sets and an outdoor view that looks somewhat like Gotham City. The music is certainly some of the best for Coen regular Carter Burwell (he re-arranges or borrows some from Aram Khatchaturian). The camera is always engaging from the great Roger Deakins, who knows how to give the camera an aerobic workout without distraction.For anyone who is allergic to the mean-spiritedness and grotesque, off-putting violence of some of the other Coen films (Blood Simple, Miller's Crossing, Fargo), The Hudsucker Proxy is a welcome carnival of enjoyment -- not a trace of highfalutin nastiness here. There's no guilt in finding pleasure here, either, the way that you may be disgusted with yourself for laughing in Fargo, for instance.No modern filmmakers use dialogue and verbal gymnastics in such a fun way as Joel and Ethan.

(One of the other few films that I'd put in that category also features Tim Robbins and also came out in 1994 - The Shawshank Redemption. Good year for Tim, eh?)Hudsucker Proxy is inventive, funny, full of wonderfully drawn characters and vignettes, and even hits some nice dramatic chords amongst the comedy and business satire. So why did this film fail so miserably at the box office? As others have pointed out, it can only be one thing- the title. The Hudsucker Proxy? Gosh, who would want to see that? As I recall, I didn't want to see it on video, either, when I heard that title, but my father, who rents just about every movie that comes out, highly recommended it. I'm glad he did and I'm glad I gave it a chance. But whoo, what a stinker of a title, and though this film is perhaps not of the style that would have made it a big hit, regardless of the title, I really think that the fact that it only grossed $3 million is definitely because of that. With a better title, I think it might have been a sleeper, as more people would have given it a chance. But that's irrelevent now. It's certainly a great movie, so if you haven't seen it because of the title, give it a chance anyway!9 out of 10 "},{"Title":"Don't forget Howard Hawkes.","Date":"29 July 2002","Score":"","Genre":"Comedy, Fantasy","Review":"  There seems to be a tendency in a lot of folks who like the Coen brother's films to dismiss criticism with a derisive you just don't get it, something that has rubbed quite a few others the wrong way. I can see merits in both sides. On the one hand, the Coens seem to be steeped in film history, write lots of jokes that are grounded in allusion, double entendre, subtlety and arcane references. As such, it is not all that easy to get the Coen brothers without having watched a lot of film and read a lot of books. On the other hand, quite a lot in the films is accessible to the point of transparent. For instance, their quite a lot of the humor in almost all of their films is bawdy, jocular and pretty straightforward.All this leads me to the Hudsucker Proxy, which is my personal favorite of their films. I like their other offerings very much, but this film seems to grab the elements of screwball comedy, modernist photography and good guy-finishes-first plotline in a way that hearkens back to His Girl Friday and The Philadelphia Story. The writing is razor sharp, the casting is superb, the editing is seamless, the acting is top shelf and the gags are great. For anyone who likes the comic sensibilities of Capra, Hawkes, and even Wilder, then this film is for them. Ignore the rubbish about how dumb this film is; suspend judgment and take it all in.

The company bylaws state that in the event of Hudsucker's death, all of his stock would go to the open market on January 1st, turning control of the company to the public.The board, headed by Sidney J.

Then they'd fire the nitwit, put in a real CEO, and bring the stock back up.It's not long before they find their idiot Norville Barnes (Tim Robbins), a naive graduate of a business school in Muncie, Indiana, who just started work in the mail room. He can't believe his good fortune, rising so quickly to the top of the company, but a reporter from a local newspaper, Amy Archer (Jennifer Jason Leigh), doesn't buy it, so she goes undercover to find the truth behind the top twit at Hudsucker.The dialogue in the movie is absolutely brilliant, fast-paced and rapid-fire, especially coming from Leigh and John Mahoney. Tim Robbins is convincing as the naive Norville, and Leigh plays an excellent fast paced career gal. The cinematography alternates between breathtaking and brilliant, and in one or two places, it's both. Great pains were taken to give you the impression that Hudsucker Industries is HUGE.

I was pestering him for some new films to see, since it was obvious that he had a pretty offbeat, but cool, taste. Once I heard he had Taxi Driver, I begged him to lend it me. He also came back from the storeroom with this. I was not impressed. I had never seen any Coen movies before this one, and it had an unwieldy title and what sounded like a less than interesting plot. You wanted my advice, he said, Just watch it...  I stubbornly wasn't so sure.Then, lo and behold, I was left bed-bound by a bout of flu and bored out of my head. I figured I had nothing to lose by popping it in the video and watching it.

This screwball comedy has plenty of well acted actors, well directed scenes, and a very decent setup, but doesn't take any of it seriously in the slightest.A simple minded mailman (Tim Robbins) gets hired on as the president of the Hudsucker Proxy corporation after the old president (Charles Durning) commits suicide, not realizing that he's being used by board member Sidney Mussburger (Paul Newman) to scare the stock into becoming more cheap.The style that's going on in this movie is so goofy and so out there, that it's hard not to be entertained. The performances are directed in such a fashion that they're going out of their way to drive every single stereotype into the ground that they can. Tim Robbins as a likable goof ball that screws everything up, Jennifer Jason Leigh as a fast talking news reporter, and Buzz, the elevator guy go to show how this film is kind of making fun of itself. It's clich√©d, but I think it's trying to be.Even though it has sentimental moments, it is not a film to take seriously in the slightest (you'll know what I mean in the climax). It's not that it's badly directed, it's just directed very strange. This is a film that the Coen brothers bet somebody that they'd make. I could not believe a film like this exists, but either way it's really entertaining, so if that's what you're going for, have at it.

The adagio's sweeping chords neatly blend melancholy with something resembling hope. But who knows from Khachaturian? The Sabre Dance and that's it. Maybe he'd have gotten more play if he'd changed his name to something easier to spell and remember. Something like UScuzzbagUX.Basically it's the story of Tim Robbins, a nonentity in the lower bowels of the giant Hudsucker organization in 1957. Robbins has an idea based on a simple circle but the president (or chairman or high panjandrum or whatever), Paul Newman, dismisses him despite the contrary advice of Jennifer Jason Leigh. Robbins' idea turns out to be the Hula Hoop. He rises to the top, displacing Newman, but then gets lazy and turns mean to subordinates. Full of himself, as they say.The fad dies and Robbins is fired and turns into a suicidal drunk. In a hilarious scene, Steve Buscemi is the bartender at one of those Beatnik coffee houses popular in the late 50s. He impatiently explains to Robbins that no alcohol is sold here. Okay, okay, mumbles the befuddled but resigned Robbins, then just give me a martini. With the help of one or two angels, Robbins comes to his senses just before he offs himself. He inherits the majority of Hudsucker stock, Newman is sent off to Sunnyvale Farms, and Robbins then invents the Frisbee. Happy ending.The fantasy is stretched so far by special effects and stylized situations that an extraordinary load is placed on the actors. They do their best and, for the most part, succeed. I guess it's intended to be an outrageous comedy with dramatic overtones (or undertones) along the lines of Frank Capra. Sometimes, though, the funny effects are sillier than they are amusing. The Coen brothers are best at comedy when they don't try so hard. Fargo's laughs come from situations rooted in reality, not from a body taking five minutes to fall from the 45th floor of the Hudsucker Building while having an argument with itself.Paul Newman has never been successful at comedy per se. He came closest to success with The Prize. But here he excels as the growling, ruthless, cigar-chomping head of Hudsucker Enterprises -- hoarsely barking out orders in his gargling voice to fire somebody or cut someone's throat. Robbins, on the other hand, is often slightly comic, sometimes whether he wants to be or not. There's something slightly ludicrous in his over-sized and shapeless appearance. He gets the job done here. Jennifer Jason Leigh -- whoever told her to do her Katherine Hepburn impression? Her snappy lines and wisecracks are funny enough, but through the whole movie? In any case, some misjudgments in the writing and direction aside, I enjoyed it. The Coen brothers have an ambitious imagination the size of Minnesota. They should keep it up for a long time.

There are two proxies actually, Norville Barnes (Tim Robbins) as the 'schmoe' replacement for Waring Hudsucker, and Amy Winehouse as his secretary, operating undercover as a reporter for the Manhattan Argus. The film took me back to those great screwball capers of the 1940's; His Girl Friday comes readily to mind, complete with snappy dialog and fast talking newspapermen. Those who don't 'get it' so to speak, can't appreciate the parody of the over the top acting, perfectly nuanced to mimic movies of more than a half century gone by. I guess I discovered the Coen Brothers a lot later than many of their fans, having never seen their earliest films when they first came out. Catching up now, I see how recurring themes show up in their stories regularly. Here I'm thinking about the use of circular objects, notably the coffee stain on the Hudsucker Want-Ad, Norville's grand design that he'd been honing for years, and the eventual production of the extruded plastic dingus. I thought maybe Norville might have had a little help from Forrest Gump, both pictures came out the same year. I was surprised to see Paul Newman in a large support role here, excellent as always. Steve Buscemi makes his mandatory appearance in a Coen film once again, and as a quick reminder how fleeting 'Entertainment Tonight' celebrity can be, I actually had to think quite a while to come up with Anna Nicole Smith's name. Still, you have to give credit to Jennifer Jason Leigh as Norville's conflicted nemesis. One has to wonder how long it took for her and John Mahoney to memorize their lines well enough to rip them off as quick as they did - whew!The Hudsucker Proxy is a film that just begs to be seen more than once, there's no way to catch all the dialog the first time around. There's also that great scene in Mussberger's (Newman) office when Norville gets his foot stuck in the waste basket. It's not something I would usually find to be all that funny, but for some reason, the whole thing just struck me how absurd the whole situation was and I just couldn't stop laughing. Here in true Coen Brothers fashion, you have the makings of a real rumpus. "}{"Title":"Who the heck is Mona Lisa?

The film combines elements of Frank Loesser's musical How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying (the college fight song, mailroom atmosphere, and quick rise of an unlikely and under-qualified protagonist, etc.) with a brilliantly written screenplay of the caliber of the Princess Bride. Paul Newman, Tim Robbins, and Jennifer Jason Leigh perform brilliantly in lead roles in the movie, while the supporting roles and bit parts are almost perfectly played. Bill Cobbs and John Mahoney are absolutely stellar, while celebrated actors Bruce Campbell and Steve Buscemi perform admirably in limited roles.The thing that really makes this movie tick (and you can quote me on that) is how rewarding it is each time you watch it. While many movies today are hardly worth an initial viewing, the Hudsucker Proxy is so brilliantly subtle that each time you watch it you pick up on something new, whether it's in dialogue, cinematography, time references, anachronism, or some of the more obscure jobs that require experience, you are bound to be entertained and to think a little. In a day when comedy has lost its intellectual edge and satire, wit, irony, have gone the way of logic an rhetoric in education, Hudsucker provides a refreshing break from the puerile, sophomoric sex and drug reference humor that any junior high class clown could write. If physical comedy is you cup of tea, there are also a couple of brilliant scenes (Bumstead contract, Plexiglas) in this film. With the exception of a dream sequence where Norville Barnes dances with an immodestly clad woman who represents his success, the film is family friendly with mild language and little violence.Overall, Hudsucker was one of the best motion pictures of the 1990s, perhaps eclipsed only by the Shawshank Redemption (also with Robbins), Schindler's List, Forrest Gump, and Braveheart.

All those things working for it to give it that launch - the production design (amazing!  worth the price of admission alone), witty, clever banter, the terrific performances, a quick, nitro-fueled script - get wasted by the fact that the Coens just don't take their characters seriously, and in turn we don't take them seriously.  So when the hero falls from grace, we feel so what?Nonetheless the Coens do give actors opportunities to create engaging, unforgettable characters.  Special credit goes to Jennifer Jason Leigh as the disillusioned Bryn Mawr-bred journalist out to discredit the hero - and unwittingly becoming attached to him.  Some of the supporting and cameo roles are done so well you want whole movies about the character alone - Charles Durning's Waring Hudsucker, Bruce Campbell as the wiseass of the newsroom, and so on.  Tim Robbins is earnest in his role, but part of the film's failing is his failing - I never really cared that much about his character.  He fell into success and then fell out again.Like Barton Fink, this one comes off the rails a little less than 2/3 of the way through, when events begin to occur too quickly and without emotional resonance.  But for what it's worth, this movie has some of the best montages and set pieces in memory, especially the creation and sudden success of the hula hoop to Khatchaturian's sabre-dance.  The scene with the 'idea guys' (three silhouettes in an office) trading potential brand-names for the 'extruded plastic dingus' is a definite highlight.This is a don't miss movie, but it's greatness is balanced by its weaknesses.

The use of classic slapstick humour, the enchanting settings (even if they are in a city, inside a giant building and a factory) and this endlessly optimistic (sure, he nearly hits rock bottom near the end, but a happy ending can not be far away) Norville Barnes make this a truly exuberant, over the top event, one that could be enjoyed by all.Or so you would think, but actually, the role played by Jennifer Jason Leigh became pretty annoying at moments (as did some others, like that elevator man), even if she did a great job of what she was supposed to do. At the heart of things, there is a sympathetic and heartfelt story perhaps, but it hardly came across with all the tomfoolery and what not.Well done, but hardly my cup of tea these days. 6 out of 10.

Great performances from Tim Robbins and Paul Newman (Sure, sure), although I'm ambiguous about Jennifer Jason Leigh. There's a very fine line when modern actresses try to imitate Rosalind Russell/Katharine Hepburn in fast-talking' 30s/40s films. Genuine success (IMO) is Cate Blanchett as, well, Katharine Hepburn in The Aviator; Gwyneth Paltrow in Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow is a lot weaker, although her dialog isn't as rapid-fire as Blanchett's or Leigh's. There were some scenes where Leigh was very good, while others she was quite obviously ACTING. Also, that ending as totally messed up, and awesome.

Maybe they were trying to make the Hud feel a little older and out of touch but the film felt very 1940s and the extreme art deco touches felt like the 1930's.  I just felt like no one cared about the details--just make it look old.  Contrast this against the minute attention to detail in 'O- Brother' and you'll see where I'm coming from.  Jennifer Jason Leigh does a good 'Philadelphia-Story'-Katherine Hepburn imitation but it gets on one's nerves just the same.

As a satire on American business it works OK, especially in today's post-Enron world. But maybe that's the problem - it can't make up its mind whether to be satire or screwball, and in the end it finishes up suspended in a vacuum between the two. Paul Newman, as usual, is excellent as indeed are most of the cast. Jennifer Jason Leigh does well with a difficult role. She starts out as a fast talking brash over-confident reporter, but about halfway through mysteriously evolves into something completely different, becoming very concerned about Barnes's (Tim Robbins) well-being. In fact the whole relationship between these two seems to have been forcibly manipulated in order to suit the overall plot.See it for the visual treat it is, but don't expect too much in terms of message or belly laughs.

It is not even clear whether the Coens intended to make a cheeky parody of the Italo-American master's works, or just wanted to pay a homage to his incomparable style. The main source of inspiration for The Hudsucker Proxy  is plainly Meet John Doe, with many hints from other Capra's films.The movie has remarkable merits. The whole part about the hula-hoop and its commercial success is pure genius. The photography, sceneries and visual effects are magnificent. The wisecrack of the script is good, though we expect much more from the Coens. The scenes at the newspaper are generally brilliant. The ironic design of the character of the journalist Amy is beautifully made, yet... in a head-to-head between Jennifer Jason Leigh and the great Barbara Stanwyck, well, there's no match.However, The Hudsucker Proxy has terrible defects, too. But for Leigh, the whole cast act in a farcical, clown-like way (Newman and Durning included, alas!). There's no evident reason in doing so it's just annoying. Several scenes are slow-paced and boring, others are irritatingly superfluous. An instance for all Norville's dream, with the female-dancer and the music from Carmen. What for? The whole finale is just awful. What's this stuff? A satire of the American way of life? A shabby, poor parody of Capra's films? An unpretentious farce which tries to be funny, with excruciating results? Too bad!Balancing praises and faults, I think that The Hudsucker Proxy deserves a 6/10.

And it's a pretty good story, one that would be right at home among the works of Capra, Hawks and Sturges. But the Coens have a tendency to go big, and when working in an idiom that already calls for big performances, it's a case of overkill. From the exaggerated design of the corporate machine to Jennifer Jason Leigh's ridiculous attempt at a period dialect, it all screams trying too hard. The tone is just too tongue-in-cheek, it needs a little more sincerity and a little less winking. The gags get smothered by all the stylistic choices, and consequently the film just isn't very funny. But it does have heart, in the same way that similarly goofy pictures like RAISING ARIZONA and O BROTHER WHERE ART THOU? (another Sturges tribute) do.

His sneaky executives quickly hatch a scheme to make the company's stock plummet so they can buy it all up cheaply. They install a greenhorn kid, Norville Barnes, as a puppet president to inspire panic in the investors. Norville seems pretty dumb, but he has some surprises up his sleeve ...I adore this movie - it's hilarious, wonderful, romantic, incredibly stylish and completely unlike any other film. The premise is just terrific; the greedy executives' plan backfires in grand style, Norville and Amy not only find love but learn amusingly opposite life lessons and the ever-present circle of life theme is one of the best visual/subtext ideas in all of cinema. As with many of the Coen Brothers' films, it is the unique gel of intriguing characters and dazzling style which combines to produce such a rich, memorable picture and this is one of their best (along with Raising Arizona and Miller's Crossing). I guess there are some elements of this film which aren't for everyone - the performances are extreme, the set-pieces are insane and the dialogue is so fast and screwy that it sometimes feels as if your ears are being pulled off - but if you really love cinema you have to like this film. There is a six minute sequence, scored with Sabre Dance from Khachaturian's ballet Gayane, detailing the conception, creation, marketing and boom-popularity of the Hula-Hoop, which I can only describe as simple perfection - film-making at its best. But the movie is just stuffed full of such scenes (Waring Hudsucker's demise, the Blue Letter, Amy's scam in the diner, Doc Bronfenbrenner's presentation to the board, Norville's angelic encounter) and the cast have a ball with their nutty characters. Robbins and Newman are nicely matched as goofy nice guy and corporate killer but the showstopper is undoubtedly Leigh in an amazing, no-holds-barred, half Rosalind Russell, half Katharine Hepburn, dialogue-blatting hellspitter of a performance, which is one of the funniest and most inventive I've ever seen. The rest of the cast are terrific, notably Cobbs as the other-worldy timekeeper Moses, Mahoney as the wacky editor, Campbell as the newsroom heel, Darga as the psycho mailroom orientation guy (Wrong colour voucher, and they dock ya !), Buscemi as a beatnik bartender and Durning as the eponymous cause of all the shenanigans. Somehow they all manage to work their way around the loopy dialogue (Ze dingus is qvite simple really. It operates on ze same principle zat keeps ze Earth spinning around ze sun and zat keeps you from flying off ze Earth into ze cold reaches of space, where you vould die like a mizerable schwein.) and the result is a glorious celebration of fifties slang, filled with delightful comic exchanges. The Three Stooges meets His Girl Friday. The script, by the Coens and Sam Raimi (they also wrote the underrated Crimewave together) is simply one of the best ever written. What else can I say about this movie - Carter Burwell's dreamy score is one of his very best (only surpassed by Miller's Crossing), and Roger Deakins' photography, Dennis Gassner's production design and Michael J. McAlister's visual effects are all gorgeous. This movie is not all that well known, which is a shame, because it's an absolutely unique experience and a definite must-see. It's one of those films born purely out of love, good humour and artistic endeavour and it never fails to make me smile and feel giddy. Magic.

His character is a bit cartoonish, but in a way that is endearing, and at times extremely funny.The rest of the cast is perfect. Paul Newman is great as the bad guy, Jennifer Jason Leigh is great as the dame. Also noteworthy is Bill Cobbs, who really pulls the film together as the narrator and prescient maintenance worker, a kind of semi-divine figure who may represent a kind of humanity that can overcome the tragedy of blind causation.I noticed some plot similarities to Meet John Doe, in which a small town guy is put on the top of the world by a conniving boss character, only to come crashing down (disgraced and accused of being a fake) when he doesn't fulfill the boss's expectations. In Meet John Doe, the finale comes as the protagonist contemplates a jump from a high building on Christmas Eve, and his love interest is an apparently hard newspaper writer who quickly reveals a soft side when she falls for him. Most likely this was consciously done, and as a kind of revival of Capra-style narrative put into a zany Coen-style prism, this movie is very successful.The movie also draws on Brazil to some extent in its visualizations of a psychedelic and grandiose bureaucracy, although it is much less dark than Brazil, and much more of a comedy.In short, this movie is funny, unique, uplifting, and very well acted; a classic.

With stock too high for a board buyout, Mussburger decides to drag the stock downwards enough to buy by putting a terrible CEO in place to panic the market - that's when mailman Barnes arrives in his office.It is a real shame that this film flopped at the box office, for it is tremendous fun for those who actually get the joke.  To really appreciate this film you need at least a basic knowledge of the fast-talking, smart mouthed screwball comedies of the 30's and there about.  However it is still be easily enjoyed without this reference, as long as you are in the mood for an exaggerated comedy that exists in it's own world, albeit one that is familiar.  The plot is yet another wonderful bit of imagination from the Coen's - the hula-hoop subplot merged with the fast talking journalist stuff is just really breezy and fun.  The film has all their usual larger than life characters and even their usual smaller roles of characters representing good and evil (the 2 maintenance men).The gags are a mix of slapstick, referential gags and witty dialogue - I didn't laugh out loud consistently but I was amused thoroughly and did laugh a real hatful of times at the dialogue (not counting the mezzanine). Aside from some very sharp and funny dialogue, the overall feeling of amusement comes from the exaggerated world and the larger than life characters.  The world of Hudsucker is gothic and imaginative, buildings are impractical but impressive, the world of the mailroom is a busy hell while the accounts dept is a never-ending row of desks.  The characters are great whether it is good/evil, the angry editor, the doubting board members right down to Hudsucker himself and that wonderful opening board meeting.The film benefits greatly from a cast that is as famous as it is deep. Some of it is fortunate casting at the time but there are a lot of stars here. Robbins is good in the lead role but I wished his character had been a little savvier, allowing him to be wittier if naive rather than being a bit clueless.  Leigh plays the role pretty well, doing a reasonable impression of screwball actresses.  Newman has a great support role and is enjoying himself.  However it is in the smaller roles that I found myself amazed at the sheer number of famous faces who were given one or two good lines each. A mix of Rami & Coen regulars as well as many others, this includes Durning, Mahoney, Bill Cobbs, Bruce Campbell, Peter Gallagher, Steve Buscemi, Anna Nicole-Smith, John Goodman's voice, Mike Starr and Rami himself.Overall I found this to be a really light fun little film.  It has a few moments where the light tone dips a little to it's detriment but it never lets this happen for too long.  If you are familiar with the genre and enjoy the Coen brothers slightly twisted version of the world then you will love this.  If you aren't up to speed this film is still amusing enough to please you if you are in the mood.

If the plot isn't interesting, it just isn't an interesting film to me. I'm an action lover. I like it when stuff blows up.Nothing blows up in The Hudsucker Proxy. In fact, the whole movie is a parody. Some will say what a great parody of the 1930s. But to me, because the characters were all caricatures, I couldn't identify with anyone, didn't really care what happened. A good parody will reveal hidden themes in the parodied subject and inflate those themes in a witty manner to make a point. That didn't happen in this film. It reminded me of Spaceballs, in which scenes from Star Wars are merely repeated with no cleverness to what aspects were inflated or made fun of.There's a theme, all right, it just didn't engage me. Nice to see Jennifer Jason Leigh do some real acting, though.Who should see this film-- people who like dark comedy-- arty people who will get it and have seen lots of 1930s films-- anyone who is mad that I said something bad about SpaceballsI gave this film a 4 out of 10.

Not that I don't like flat stupid jokes, satire, intelligent humor, this just isn't it. I didn't think so. Apart from the scene where Tim Robbins tells the reporter that he has thoughts about the company's future and shows that circle. But him then saying For the kids... you know that just breaks the joke. Yeah, it's like someone else here commented, the people who directed and wrote the manuscript for this movie took it seriously, and they want viewers to take it seriously.I would have preferred if the circle Tim Robbins had made on that piece of paper wasn't so perfectly circular. And why did Tim Robbins have to get that stupid blue letter? How come did that reporter lady always know at which bar he was. If you want to make me take a movie seriously don't have so irritable shortcuts in your script. Inviting Steve Buscemi though into a 10 seconds role as barman near the end, that is fun but not specially original if they just paid him good money to be in that little role.I didn't take this movie seriously, I never like to take any movie seriously, I like when you see gangsters walking around and shooting each other once in a while in a Tarantino movie or when you see Jim Carrey in Me, Myself and Irene being schizofrenic, now that is funny.So Me, Myself and Irene is rated 6.0 and this stupid Hudsucker Proxy is rated 7.3? Now that suddenly makes me wonder if there isn't something wrong with imdb.com, which I admired so much until now for guiding me quite well with movie info and often guided me in choosing the right movies to rent..This movie is way overrated, I rated it 5 out of 10. And seeing it is from Joel Coen and Ethan Coen, now I wonder if I really liked Fargo and The Big Lebowski that much.. As it was so many years ago I watched those two film I might just look at them one more time and see if the Coen brothers might just have been in some Hollywood big-money kind of mood at the time they decided to make this Hudsucker Proxy happy ending piece of cheese.

Leigh gives a curious performance, seemingly channeling Katherine Hepburn as a fast-talking newspaper reporter. While there are some amusing moments, the characters are essentially caricatures and there isn't enough flow to the narrative to sustain a feature length film.

Tim Robbins mugs his way through the central role, but is infinitely more watchable than Jennifer Jason Leigh, whose excruciatingly mannered performance could give anyone a migraine.

"},{"Title":"Unadulterated Stylishness, and Not Much Else Really","Date":"30 December 2010","Score":"0 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Fantasy","Review":" This is a banquet for the eyes. The art direction and set design are awe-inspiring, reconstructing the cosmos of 1930s screwball comedy in which immense skyscrapers and immeasurable boardrooms were the playgrounds for the determination of crooked executives, go-getting kids, unsung masterminds, and lady journalists with strategy as rapid-fire as their repartee, but it is also imbued throughout with the Coens' inimitable mark of genre fine-tuning and crafty, mugging humor.However, the movie's hindrance is that it's all facade and no theme. Not even the least endeavor is made to indicate that the film takes its own narrative into account. Everything is technique. The performances feel self-consciously slanted as lampoons. Yet those performances are right on track. Tim Robbins stars, as a mailroom clerk who finds himself propelled into the administration of the massive Hudsucker Corporation. Paul Newman is the aged distinction behind the curtain, who coaxes Robbins' power as he supposes the kid is utterly bungling, and will push the stock price down, just what Newman wants. The over-romantic tenor of ordinary men as heroes is cheerfully predisposed by films of Frank Capra like Meet John Doe and It's a Wonderful Life. And Jennifer Jason Leigh has been scrutinizing Rosalind Russell in His Girl Friday with shades of Katharine Hepburn, and has the part down faultlessly...to a fault.But who cares? Is there anyone in this movie to actually be concerned about? Regardless, most of the film's majesty is at the very outset of this, well, screwball comedy by proxy, which establishes its verve in the opening sequence, as an executive crashes out of a skyscraper and the camera paves his way in a diving plummet down what seems like a couple of hundred stories of a petrifying drop. It and the surrounding goings-on are invigorating.But to what aim but unadulterated stylishness? And isn't there a problem between the movie's look and feel, which are unmistakably 1930s Art Deco, and its assertion that it's set in the 1950s? I doubt if many viewers cares about that, especially since setting it in the '50s permits the Coens to have oodles of merriment with the inspiration of the Robbins character, who creates the hula hoop and makes incalculable billions for Hudsucker.And the hula hoop, sequentially, affords a reason for a montage showcasing rhythmic gymnastics spreading across America, a filmmaking device which the sibling duo in some way are able to manipulate and tease simultaneously. The hula hoop centerpiece is also something that Robbins necessary must invent that at first glance is absurd that would appear, by any kind of logical gauge, to be destined to bomb, yet something that conversely we're already aware is going to be an extraordinary sensation. The entire circle pattern seems worked into the style of the film, the conflict between these soaring buildings, then these circular echoes in the structure of the story itself. It begins with the end and harks back to the opening, not to mention also Bill Cobbs' opening monologue, the Hudsucker Clock, Mussburger's wristwatch, the the hula hoops and frisbees, and even a conversation about Karma.But all in all, isn't there something numb at the core of all of this? Don't we exhaust more of the film appreciating the visual highlights than caring about them? That's the tired, and now completely obsolete crack against the Two-Headed Director, that they're all style and no spirit. Most movies reprocess jaded old blueprints. Here's one that makes no bones about its doing so and indeed sumptuously embraces that intention. It screamingly evokes Safety Last with its country boy coming to the big city and ending up hanging from a giant clock. The mechanistic monstrousness of the mailroom contrasted with the angular gigantism of the corporate offices perfectly matches the boss-labour split of Metropolis. There's even a blatant nod to Hitchcock's Saboteur in the splitting of Newman's pant leg as he dangles out the window mimics the Statue of Liberty sequence.One fine cause to go to the movies is to indulge the eyes, even if not all of one's head is indulged. And this quite funny and potentially incisive lampoon of big business is a spectacle to behold. Unless you desire something further. It's a minor work, yes, but still another verification of the Coens' status among America's most ambitious, able and exciting film-makers.

Big Laughs!","Date":"23 February 2007","Score":"0 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Fantasy","Review":" The Coen Brothers are never afraid to tackle the machinations of everyday life. And in the case of The Hudsucker Proxy, they choose to skewer the corporate world of boardrooms, politics and office rivalries. And it has to be said they've done quite a superb job. This is a much better film than Wall Street. For the simple fact The Hudsucker Proxy is a true original, and quite unlike anything I've ever seen.In one of the most breathtaking opening shots I've ever seen in a film, the camera glides over the New York cityscape on New Years Eve, 1958. It closes on the Hudsucker Building, a tall skyscraper with a clock face that looks like a cross between the Empire State Building and Big Ben if such a thing is possible. A man climbs onto a window ledge and contemplates suicide. The film than jumps back a month and tells the story of how this man, Norville Barnes (Tim Robbins), the President of Hudsucker Industries came to this decision.When Norville arrived in New York, he was a recent business school graduate from Muncie, Indiana. A man with tall ideas but short on common sense and experience. When he learns a vacancy has opened up at Hudsucker Industries in the mail room, he applies, and sees this job as working his slow way to the top.But as Norville's on his way in, another Hudsucker employee's on his way out. On the 45th floor, the current President, Waring Hudsucker (Charles Durning) takes a dive out a window. And quite a scene it is too. We follow him all the way down to the pavement. You actually feel exhilarated. Until reality hits home with you about what's just happened.Since Hudsucker left no will, company shares are available to buy on the open market. But the Vice President, Sidney J. Mussburger (a cigar chomping Paul Newman) has other plans. He has his eye on becoming the new President, but bides his time. He instead hits on the idea that if he appoints a new President, but one intended purely as a proxy, someone who is a complete incompetent, Hudsucker stock will devalue, Mussburger can buy it back, and take over as the new President. And Norville is the lucky schlub to be picked.His appointment shocks New York, and piques the curiosity of Amy Archer (a snappy turn by Jennifer Jason Leigh), a tough as nails reporter with an accent as clipped as her prose. She goes undercover as Norville's secretary, wanting to get to the root of this situation, and engages in a little romance with Norville at the same time.The Hudsucker Proxy is not your standard film about big business. But that may be where its appeal lies. As is usual with a Coen Bros film, its made up of a lot of different elements. Politics, fantasy, romance, black comedy. Because it has such a wide variety of clashing styles it may account for why THP was a box office flop. Even though the Coens' do an admirable job of compressing its different plot points into a successful package.But another reason is how expensive the film must have been to make. One thing that strikes you right away is how grand the sets are. The Hudsucker Building is one of the most astonishing set-pieces ever constructed. Offices are the size of sound-stages. The sorting office is a multilayered cocoon of chutes, whistles and sirens. And the clock face on front of the building is so vast it casts an ominous shadow over Paul Newman's office whenever the minute hand is on the move.Its a testament to the cast that they're not swallowed up by the somewhat intimidating nature of the sets. Tim Robbins is likable enough as Norville. Its interesting watching his transition from someone with initially good intentions. After he markets a circle that emerges as the Hula-Hoop, and it becomes a nationwide craze, his success starts to go to his head. Its quite a long journey he's on that eventually takes him to that window ledge. And its fascinating to see how he gets there.But its in the supporting cast where the film really shines. I've come to realise that in any film made by the Coen Bros, there is always one actor that gives the film its life. Frances McDormand in Fargo. M Emmet Walsh in Blood Simple. But in The Hudsucker Proxy, we have two, Paul Newman and Jennifer Jason Leigh.Their characters are like two sides of the same coin even though they never actually meet. Newman knows Norville is an idiot, waits for him to make a mistake, convinces him its a good idea, and calmly sits back and watches as the world falls out from under Norville. Paul Newman has never had so much fun in a part.Amy also knows Norville is an idiot, but despite her better judgement develops faith in him that somehow he'll pull everything together. Any scene with her is a delight. She storms into rooms and takes charge. When she speaks, people fall silent. She's a haughty, no-nonsense gal. And strangely sexy all at the same time.Things start to fall apart of course for Norville. An escalation of events that lead to his decision to kill himself. But salvation presents itself from beyond the grave! And its satisfying to see Mussburger get the comeuppance he was planning to inflict on Norville.The Hudsucker Proxy is just as impressive as anything else the Coen Bros have produced. Its a film that should be appreciated by everyone. A fun, witty and occasionally extraordinary glimpse into the world of big business. Shame that its expensive production values precluded the possibility of it turning a profit. Because this is first rate, ultra classy entertainment.

As the next in line, expertly played by Paul Newman, he hatches a plan -- if we get a proxy president who is incompetent, it will drive down the stock and we can pool our money to buy up 51%, to keep ordinary people out of our company.Robbins plays the recent graduate who isn't very assertive nor very bright, and it looks like their plan is working.

Every single character suddenly speaks as if he/she only had a minute left to live, and wants desperately to say everything he/she can in that minute. We get a scene or two of Zucker-style 80's spoof-like scenes of background shenanigans. And then, just when you think it couldn't possibly get any less serious, any more ridiculous and lame, they throw in a romantic subplot and a bunch of fantasy stuff. The first half hour is pure genius, everything from that point just gets lower and lower. The plot is OK, but it never seems to take off. The pacing is awful, the film seems to stand perfectly still from the moment Tim Robbins' character is made director of the firm. The acting ranges, but most of it is terribly over-the-top. The characters are somewhat well-written but they hardly have a shred of personality, are mostly clich√©d and stereotypical, and none of them are particularly likable or interesting. The dialog is at times well-written, but mostly it's just as overdone as the acting. The script just has so many scenes and parts written into it that seem to be there for no reason. This film holds a few funny scenes, but most of them are during the first half hour. Want my advice? What do you mean, no? Well, here it is anyway watch the first half hour. If you like it, but think it could be better, watch on. If you love it, stop the film. There's nothing like that from that point on, and you don't want to see how this ends... trust me. The ending is as lame as they come. However, if you find the first half hour to be anything less than great, your expectations might be low enough to tolerate what happens from that point on. I'm just surprised that the Coen's could put together a film like this... I mean, they made The Man Who Wasn't There and Intolerable Cruelty. I don't know, maybe I just needed to be in an entirely different state of mind to enjoy this film any more than I did. I recommend this to fans of the Coen's, as they should enjoy it.

Obviously aiming for the feel of a Preston Sturges classic comedy, Hudsucker Proxy is a stridently acted, indifferently written display of cinematic excess.Norville Barnes (Tim Robbins) lands in New York City just off the bus from Muncie, Indiana, looking for a job. Just as he gives up hope, a job literally falls from the sky, that of chief executive of cash-loaded Hudsucker Industries. Its CEO/Founder Waring Hudsucker (Charles Durning) merges with the infinite by taking a header from the 44th floor, leaving his board with a lot of precious loose stock to claim. Board member Sidney Mussburger (Paul Newman) decides the best solution is to bring the stock price down, quick, and grab up what the market dumps.Waring Hudsucker is abstract art on Madison Avenue, Mussburger sneers. What we need now is a new president who will inspire panic in the stockholder. After Barnes nearly sets fire to Mussburger's office, the old snake figures he's found just the guy.Newman's unique here in that he doesn't spit out his lines rapid-fire out of the side of his mouth like William Demarest with lockjaw or any of Newman's castmates in this movie. He kind of growls and barks instead, offering terrific Newman presence but working against the little comedy there is, which mostly centers on how rough the business world is and how it victimizes the little guy. It's a Sturges story that way at least.Except when Newman's on the screen, Hudsucker Proxy is a kind of movie that can give you whiplash just from the subtitles. Most egregious in this regard is Jennifer Jason Leigh, who plays an undercover reporter by cross-channeling Rosalind Russell-meets-Katharine Hepburn. It's fun to watch her for a minute or two even with her lines obviously dubbed in at points, but watching her flap her hands around and rant in what might as well be Esperanto for minutes at a time gets tired.Hudsucker itself seems to work with the idea the faster it moves, the more clever it is. Or maybe it's just trying to bull you though a sketchy plot. Once Barnes plays his and the movie's one ace, revealing this invention which he has been touting since the opening credits, he becomes a heel and a bore. Barnes should offer an engaging center, but doesn't because of both a lacking script Ethan and director Joel Coen wrote with horror-film legend Sam Raimi and because of Robbins' overly broad performance.By the time the movie gets to the end, you can feel the writers shrugging their collective shoulders. You got a better idea? a character asks us directly at one point, a funny moment but also an admission that they did not.Stylistically, Hudsucker Proxy is fun to look at, with its stereotypical 1950s production design run amuck. Engaging piecework from Bruce Campbell and John Mahoney as a pair of hard-case journalists and Peter Gallagher as a thinly-disguised Dean Martin mean good things turn up now and again. The Carter Burwell score plays off the melody of Stormy Weather before launching into some engaging thematic material of its own.Hudsucker is ultimately a film that exists to show off its influences, and be judged by comparison. That these guys love Preston Sturges is clear here; that they picked up on his screen economy, witty dialogue, and razor-sharp characterizations is better demonstrated by their other movies.

For kids! &#x96; Norville Barnes The Coen brothers homage the works of Preston Sturges, Howard Hawks and Frank Capra (as well as John Landis' Trading Places) with The Hudsucker Proxy. The plot Tim Robbins plays Norville Barnes, a Capra inspired everyman whose very ineptitude gets him hired by evil corporate heads, all of whom are determined to lower the value of Hudsucker Industries stock. But Robbins simplemindedness has the opposite effect. He lifts Hudsucker Industries out of near bankruptcy and makes the company millions by selling circles over and over again to kids. Meanwhile, the shady manoeuvrings of the Hudsucker company are investigated by actress Jennifer Jason Leigh, who does a rapid-fire impression of Hawks favourite Rosalind Russel.Like most postmodern films, The Hudsucker Proxy depends entirely on nostalgia. It is the very pastness of the past, its inaccessibility, that accounts for nostalgia's power. But this is rarely the past as actually experienced, but the past as imagined and idealised through memory, forgetfulness, distortion, reorganisation and desire. In this sense nostalgia is always less about the past than about an inadequate present. It is a historical inversion, in which the ideal that is not being lived now is projected into the past. In this regard, Hudsucker Proxy even has a giant magical clock which has the power to pause, preserve and rewind time.There are, of course, many ways to look backward. You can look and reject, learn, critique etc. Or you can look and linger longingly. In its yearning backwardness, postmodernism is thus not only a recovery project, but an attempt to defy the end. To evade movement. As cinema collapses, nostalgia may also be particularly appealing as a possible escape from what Lee Quinby calls technological apocalypse. Or, as Linda Hutcheon says, if the future is cyberspace, then what better way to soothe techno anxieties than to yearn for a Mont Blanc fountain pen?Today, capitalism and postmodernity no longer need to rely on individual memory. Instead, thanks to technology, digital, audio and video reproduction, nostalgia can be fed forever and ever and ever by an ever accelerating circle, a hyper-access loop to an infinitely recyclable past. Under postmodernism/capitalism, everything is then sold as change, but nothing does, and pleasure is falsely ascribed an emancipatory potential. Today's art is just one symptom of this deadlock. And if the Coens are one of its chief purveyors, each film a self-aware, self-conscious photocopy for those who can't remember, then Hudsucker's Tim Robbins' character epitomizes them best, the guy continuously re-marketing and re-branding the circle. You know? For kids.The Hudsucker Proxy has the lowest joke quota of all Coen comedies, and its screwball antics mostly all fall flat. It's not only that the Coens too often mistake convoluted word-play for wit and humour, but that this verbose brand of screwball was long diluted by TV and sitcoms. Alone among the cast, Jennifer Jason Leigh shines, with her pitch perfect resuscitation of Hawksian damsels. Altman would use her to similar effect in Kansas City. The film's production design is expensive but claustrophobic, though there are two heavily storyboarded, visually striking sequences.6/10 &#x96; See Trading Places. Worth one viewing.

And I have the feeling that it's because of that, this movie seems to be a bit more appreciated over here in Europe then it is in America. Anyway, this is the Coens their take on the ideology of The American Dream. The result is one truly magnificent and funny movie, and I consider it to be as some of their best work to date, even though it took me 12 years to finally see it (I have no excuse for that, except there are so many movies to watch, you know).Simply everything about this film, from writing over set design to acting & directing is superb. All the sets (incuding the highly detailed miniatures of the city buildings) are a lust for the eye. Tim Robbins really goes all the way in portraying Norville Barnes, an ambitious yet naive young man who is mistaken for an imbecile in his climb to success. Jennifer Jason Leigh is amazing and really proofs what a versatile actress she is in this one. She got that 40's acting style going on there, which is a highly contradicting and a welcome change to some of her other more dramatic rolls, like in RUSH (1991) and more recently THE MACHINIST (2004). Paul Newman is devilish good and there's a notable supporting role for BruceAshCampbell (who gets slapped in the face quite a lot in this film). The writing of the dialogues is excellent, complex and highly enjoyable. One of the most funny lines is spoken by John Mahoney (as Chief Editor Manhattan Argus) Yeah, well, if a frog had wings, it wouldn't bump its ass while hopping!. I just had to rewind that one, never heard it before. That's extremely witty writing there. However, I must admit that on some rare occasions the movie does tend to get a bit sappy (Go eagles in the Beatnik bar). But still, the Coens can get away with that, I guess. Other pretty outrageous scenes generously make up for that. Now, this movie does not get as crazy as, for example, Terry Gilliam's BRAZIL, but it does feature some of those surreal, fairy-tale-like touches, although in a much more friendly and charming way.So, THE HUDSUCKER PROXY simply is a must-see film. It's a Coen-masterpiece and an excellent movie in general. I even have this feeling that when I'll see this one a second time, I just might come back here and give it 10/10.

I still cannot quite figure out why, but perhaps it has to do with the fact that the Coens were unable to produce a script original enough to stand on its own. While it certainly makes its homage known, it feels almost as if the story could not stand without the classic comedies from the 1930s an 1940s. This film pays due to several of the great screen comedies including Mr. Deeds Goes to Town, His Girl Friday and The Great McGinty. And while you have to admire its spirit and ambition, I can't say I loved this film if only because it wasn't as fresh and exciting as those other movies.Furthermore, the storyline lacks significantly, at least compared to other Coen films like Miller's Crossing and Barton Fink. It really is just a retread of a cross of Mr. Deeds and His Girl Friday and that is the basis of the positive material. Unfortunately, the look upstages the story and that is almost never good in a movie. If you know any of the classic comedies, you know where this is headed and that is disappointing given the great talent at work here.

But somehow, like the hoola-hoop, as shown in this film, it came around to me and I have to profess how amazing it all works so completely as a hysterical and hyperactive stylized comedy and as an example of homage going through a blender to come out with a fresh vigor. Its interesting this was in competition at the 1994 Cannes festival against Pulp Fiction, as the two of them carry a similarity (albeit the film that did win did deserve it) in the total lack of abandon for adhering to normal conventional storytelling, but at the same time staying rigidly controlled in how to USE conventions to a delirious advantage of making it more outrageous and infused with the best brio possible from the actors.For the Coen brothers, it's taking a big leap from the 44th floor- or is that 45th, with or without balcony- and it one's ready to go for the ride it's a lot of fun while having a small but effective point made about people at work. The premise is pure Hollywood farce an average dim-witted schmo named Norville (Tim Robbins) becomes the president of Hudsucker industries after unwittingly saving the life of Sidney J Mussburger (Paul Newman), and even has a good idea for a big product for, you know, the kids, which is a hoola-hoop. But it sounds fishy to news reporter Amy Archer (Jennifer Jason Leigh), who goes undercover in a not-too-hard way into his office (You're a Muncie girl?!). In the typical Capra fashion- matter of fact very much a mix and match of It's a Wonderful Life and Meet John Doe (right down to the attempted suicide by jumping off a building ledge)- we're given the naive innocence of American optimism, and then the layers shown clear as day of the cynicism, and more crucially the ugliest side of capitalism, undermining the more optimistic aspects possible.But there's always the goofy wink and the very fast and wacky nod of little things going on in a scene adding up to a lot (don't drink that so fast while getting your ear chewed off by Archer, Norville!). And then there's the direction and cinematography and production design and music and so on and so forth, given the jolt of eight cups of coffee and a rigorous reworking of how to go through montage (through photos as well as in progressing the narrative, like Norville's transformation into an uncomfortable egotistical president from humble schmuck). If it weren't so spot-on in its efforts to make pure absurdity at about a five-second rate, then the style would probably become *way* ahead of the substance quick. There's just so much going on with the 'vision'- ironic considering their hero's simple genius in creating practical things- that the filmmakers are about as ambitious, if not more so, than they were later on with O'Brother, Where Art Thou, and going a step further than Raising Arizona in how every character, to a minor degree or keyed to 11, is zany or self-conscious in some respect or another.But they pull it off not simply because all of the departments are rich in pulling all of this together, it's also the cast too. It surprises all the time to see Tim Robbins when he's given a wonderful character to tackle, but it's even more amazing to see how not only is it such a 180 turn from his other well-known role from 94 (the Shawshank Redemption), but that (very) arguably it might even be better and at least matching the range that the Coens go for in their work. He's perfectly clueless and imbecilic in the early scenes as a foil, and then as he goes through his transformation he embodies a Capra hero and, as dumb as he continues to be (can one feel bad for an obnoxious elevator operator?), one can't help but root for the fool to win and stay alive. Meanwhile, Paul Newman plays such a dastardly one-to-two note heel that it's just dazzling to see him play it with just a touch of irony to the old villains of old movies and to still make it his own. And Leigh, adopting the Russell speed from His Girl Friday, is also amusing when she gets the chance (watch her reactions to the reincarnation dialog with Norville during the party), and holds her own against Robbins. And per usual, the Coens flood their film with recognizable faces Charles Durning (his re-appearance in the climax is a laugh riot, fake halo and all), Steve Buscemi (beatnik), Bruce Campbell (newspaper stooge, oddly enough not the funniest side character even with the doodle he draws), John Mahoney (typical newspaper publisher, matching Leigh's vocal speed), and even Peter Gallagher as a pop singer! Filled with enough little visual gags for two movies, the various jokes ranging from nuanced to just plain bad puns, and many of the most obvious in-jokes to old movies told with (semi) straight faces I've ever seen, it's a wondrous work of parody; even if the film won't really strike the viewer too hard, it's hard to deny the love for the films the Coens are lightly yet swiftly skewering. The Hudsucker Proxy was not worth waiting so long, quite the opposite, it pains me to think how long I wanted to see this for such an unreasonable reason. Then again, there's always second chances.

Newman and his fellow cronies do this so the company's stock will go down so the bigwigs can buy the stocks at a fraction of their original costs. Of course this could mean millions for those near the top of the corporation. Reporter Jennifer Jason Leigh suspects that something is not quite right and gets close to Robbins, but her plan may backfire as she strangely begins to have feelings for him. Very disappointing dud from the Coen Brothers that just never does generate any interest from its potentially promising premise. Robbins and Leigh are too annoying to help and Newman acts like the only performer with any talent. Beautiful cinematography and excellent art direction get overshadowed by confusing techniques and scattered messages. 2 stars out of 5.

Their best movie is clearly The Hudsucker Proxy, one of my favorite movies of all time.  Hudsucker is truly a movie that does it all; it is hysterical while at the same time political, fun, while at the same time thought-provoking.  No other movie comes close to combining comedy and philosophy so well, and the surreal cinematography is extraordinary.  Movies today typically don't bother to be as complete as Hudsucker - every element of this movie circles around and works together. I give Hudsucker the highest compliment I can possibly give a film every time I see it, I find new intricities and new reasons to love this film.

I tried to follow,to keep going hoping the best part of the movie was yet to come. Very disappointing and frustrating.I was about to have a heart attack. I'm sorry i gave money to see this movie.I guess the acting is -okay- but the fast-paced conversations of this comedy,if you can call it that,is irritating to say the least.The story is very predictable and boring. Avoid at all costs. Movies are supposed to be entertaining and relieve you from your daily stress,whilst this picture does anything but that.

I know if was supposed to be that was and it was supposed to be campy but just not my style. Its like a serious movie thats made for little kids it almost seems. It seems a like a movie on YTV or something.This movie is about a college graduate on the lowest end of a huge corporation. The copration hatches this plan to hire a new CEO and make sure hes very dumb so the company stock falls. They want to do this so they can afford all the stock to themselvs.This movie was not all bad but one of the worst Cohen brothers movies and that pains me to say because I am a huge fan of Big Lebowski, O brother where art thou and No country for Old men. If you like quirky comedies this one you will like or if you just love the humor of the Cohen brothers and if you do you know it.

This is truly a big movie. It must have cost a great deal to get to the theaters. There is so much eye candy that usually doesn't exist in their more sparse movies. This doesn't make it bad. It's as if too much detracts a bit from the underlying ideas of characterization. Tim Robbins is used as a caricature. Jennifer Jason-Leigh is a Katherine Hepburn recreation. She even embraces her speech patterns. I know this was an effort to do a parody of one of those fifties gray-flannel-suit movies. It's so over the top. Throw in a little Frank Capra and even Fritz Lang and you have this. The corporate world is seen as an island unto itself and Hudsucker Enterprises is in the center of that world. Forget motivations. These guys call the shots like it's a game. It works sometimes, but sometimes parody become so obvious that it diminishes its own point. Still, this is watchable and creative and deserves some accolades.

The Coen's have jumped the shark with this take off of the American Screwball Comedy of the 30's. I cringed every time Jennifer Jason Leigh tried to imitate Katharine Hepburn's classic gargle. The poor actress may have destroyed her career with this stinker.I can't stand Tim Robbin's politics, but must admit that he is the best actor to play a fool in the movies. He almost carries this farce. Paul Newman; however, is collecting a check. He's been collecting checks since the 50's. His salad dressing stinks too.I'm amazed at how much money the Coen's command in Hollywood on such flimsy pitches. I loved Fargo and enjoyed The Big Lebowski (not as much as some cult fans), but this film, why did they bother? "}]
