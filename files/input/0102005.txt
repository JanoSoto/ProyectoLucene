Packed with testosterone and huge loads of male pride, Harley and Marlboro set out to kick some ass. I really love this movie because it shows like friendship between men works or at least how it is supposed to work. Even though the two main characters haven't met for years, they know where the other one is and when they come together again it's like they never were apart. They also help each other regardless if it will cost their live because in their mind It's better to be dead and cool, than alive and uncool. (Harley Davidson) Of course this attitude brings them nothing but trouble but those two take it the macho-way and stand to whatever comes up. And for those who only think it's a modern macho western Back off!! Take a closer look and you will see that there is a lot of soul and spirit hidden between the macho talking and behaviour.

Moreover, the movie is beautifully cast down the line and the pace is always great.  Everything from the costuming of the lead characters to the atmosphere in the bar to the performances by Tom Sizemore and Daniel Baldwin are right on target.

The ensuing plot has the two bikers repeatedly confronting the banker's cold blooded, robotic henchmen, who make quite a fashion statement with their slicked-back hair, their blank faces, and their irritatingly hip, long black coats. The numerous confrontations between the two bikers and the thugs culminate in explosions, fights, and gunfire.The story is standard Hollywood fluff, aimed at kids, young boys in particular. Except for the unique airplane graveyard setting, the plot is mostly a dud. Fortunately, the characterizations of the two leads rescue the film from banality.Harley (Mickey Rourke) and Marlboro (Don Johnson), swagger, posture, and strut their macho stuff, as you would expect, for two bikers. They swear. They fight. And, of course, they follow the babes. Underneath the public toughness, however, are two nonconformists, and each has his own brand of insecurity. And, they have a conscience. They want to do the right thing. It is this textured characterization of Harley and Marlboro that makes the film worth watching, especially in the first twenty-five minutes, before the action plot interferes.The is a working man's movie ... with all the gritty realism of urban street life. The film's first half features some good cinematography, sultry music and atmosphere, great production design, and costumes suitable for the most hip biker bar. The best approach to this film is to ignore the silly action plot, and focus instead on Harley and Marlboro, and their unorthodox outlook on life.

It was made in 1986 and the movie was supposed to take place in 1996, so it guesses as to what changes would be. It's another corny, but fun touch.

As a matter of fact up until I looked over my IMDb history, I thought I had already reviewed it but much to my surprise I haven't. I guess that will make this review that much more better as it will be one of the more current ones.This is one of those you-either-get-it-or-you-don't movies made to appeal to the egos and fantasies of the rugged alpha male. You get that sense at the opening credits as Mickey Rourke's intro scene during the opening credits makes you want to go out and ride a chopped up steel horse. It's the ultimate escape, at least for men! It's laced w/ moral fiber in that it's all about being down-and-out and still managing to drum up the where-with-all to help your fellow man. IMHO I think this movie's setbacks are through no fault of any of its creators or participants. Looking at many of the cynical reviews of movie-goers and critics of its time, it was clearly ahead of its own genre. And although many might find the title as well as some of the names of the characters to be cheesy (Virginia Slim, Jack Daniels, etc), I admire that they took the risk to acknowledge the outlaw, anti-hero biker image through images of Americana. I also read somewhere (probably on this site) that Rourke did this movie out of desperation which doesn't help a new viewer go in w/ a favorable attitude. Hopefully Mickey can look back and appreciate this piece of work like much of us do. I've still yet to see Butch & Sundance but now I'm inspired to check out Redford and Newman's piece even if it's just for the similarities that many reviewers have suggested.I guess it comes down to the fact that this is much like anything else in that it isn't for everybody. Perhaps the audience it was intended for has dwindled substantially (if it's ever really been out there). But if that's so, we can always take comfort in knowing that we have something we can truly appreciate w/o having to be fashionable.

The movie resonates for all the fellow Lone Wolves out there of every Dasein or being there. Philosopher, scientist, explorer, in this case, single guys. This is such an easy movie to review for you; the movie splits viewers into two groups. Those who love the friendship between two men who will never fit into one of society's boxes of domestication will adore the movie. Rourke and Johnson's friendship is the star of this movie; the heist strains credulity and generates the low rating you see here. Their friend, who owns a restaurant, is losing it to the bank. He is being pressured by the bank's hired goons to sell out. Harley and Marlboro concoct a scheme to rob an armored car and get the requisite money. The unlikely following events are entertaining if you turn your brain off like all action movies. This is not why I own the movie; I am one of the delineated types of Lone Wolves that the movie echoes existentially with The Philosopher. Harley makes no attempt to connect with that life he will never fit into. Marlboro painfully wants that life but just cannot fit in. He is at the end of a relationship with a female cop whose patience for his existential nomad life is at an end. The best scene in the movie is where he returns and she has a police captain in her bed.They say good-bye and the anguish on his face at wanting to be what he never can be speaks to every man in the audience who is in one of my delineated categories. I like two other submerged aspects of the movie; The closeness to God and the freedom from fear. Harley speaks often to Marlboro, to his great irritation, of there being 'something more,' 'I'd like to meet Him.' This ontological separation free from its mountain of worries about kids and wife does lead one closer to God. Yet, it is honest about the dark side also. There is this greater recklessness and risk-taking; it is viewed as phony by people not living inside of a Dasein where Death is a constant companion as are thoughts of it always. So, if you are not a lone wolf, if you were lucky enough to find a partner, my honest advice is to avoid the movie. It will do what all things that conflict with our Path do annoy or anger you. I love the movie for it reminds me I am not alone. Their are many like me who must walk alone. Their friendship, with great humor, lightens the darkness. If you choose to watch it, do not expect a realistic heist, pursuit and escape. This part does work for a handful of people; the vast majority I know hate the movie for its lack of verisimilitude. The friendship is the star of the movie and its delineation that speaks to all who must walk life alone. In its defense, yes, both aspects are true Closer to God and, concomitantly, nearer to Death. Behavior does tend to be reckless, impulsive and carefree just as you see them behave. Harley is at peace more than Marlboro. Yet, the love he cannot have has been sublimated and now it is towards God. Marlboro's painful realization that he cannot hold on to a beautiful woman who wants a family, this is the deep pathos of the movie. Believe me, the earlier the existential realization, the less suffering you will endure. The acting between the two is excellent; their friendship, with its deep sadness, will stay will you. I often re-visit the movie and draw comfort from it. There is great humor mixed in just see it for what it always has been Two men who will never be domesticated whose friendship provides the only true warmth they will find in this life.

Rourke lamented often his presence in HARLEY &#133; (he stated how ashamed he was of this role each time he had the opportunity&#151;he would better have complained more about Wild Orchid, White Sands,The Last Outlaw and other such crap instead &#133;),but this is unfair, since he made much worse career choices since. HARLEY &#133; has a nice premise&#151;a tandem of goofy picaresque travelers who embark on a grim adventure because their sense of honor asks them to .The most important thing brought by this spoof is the proof of Rourke's talent as a comedy actor; he proves to be much finer than one could have suspected. He was parodying his own bad boy tough biker persona as popularized by the tabloids. Without him in one of the two main roles, HDAMM would have been crap.As a goofy comedy, Harley Davidson and the Marlboro Man (1991) is absolutely delicious; this could have been a good concept for a TV series about a tandem of bums who &#133;.HARLEY &#133; is nothing for Mickey to be ashamed about &#133;.He did far worse movies.It came the next year after the severely, drearily underrated Desperate Hours (1990). Rourke downplayed his role in a comedy, but HARLEY &#133; is many times better than Wild Orchid (1990), White Sands (1992) and Fall Time (1995),not to mention things such as Double Team (1997), Love in Paris (1997), Point Blank (1997), Out in Fifty (1999) and Picture Claire (2001) and so many others&#151;these, and not HARLEY &#133;,are the films to be ashamed of. As a comic books action comedy, HARLEY &#133; is way better than the hideous, charm&#151;less SIN CITY. HARLEY &#133;is to Rourke's career what Beat the Devil is to Bogart's career (all proportions considered, since the Rourke comedy was not directed by a Huston, but by a much humbler director instead).Harley Davidson and the Marlboro Man (1991) is the second Rourke film I have seen; I was 15 yrs..I have re&#151;seen this movie many times since. A severe _cinephile that I have watched HARLEY &#133; with enjoyed it also, as an unpretentious, funny, youthful comedy of delightful gusto. Here Rourke laid aside his 'posters' persona', and took a funny and likable, cordial role. This should have been awarded, and not blamed. The action in HARLEY &#133; has no interest in itself whatsoever, it is merely a pretext for a double recital&#151;Rourke and his colleague. I think HARLEY &#133; is a cool comedy, what could have been a small funny interlude in Rourke's career (but proved be only the preface to an atrocious fall that he has never recovered from since).Yet, if it's funny, HARLEY &#133; is no less second&#151;rate. With the '84 exception, Rourke was never granted a first&#151;hand comedy, something that would deserve and fit him equally. Here, he is fairly above his material. He towers it. He knew how to be funny in a cordial way, without debasing himself. His role is well structured with that thorough professionalism Rourke brings to his movies.Here Rourke was not violent, sadist, crazy, furious, psychopath, sociopath, etc., but a funny, dynamic bum, in a comic books world with two dimensions. It is too bad he was not allowed to explore this comic aptitude of his (while he was still young and beautiful). He proved to have, surprisingly, the modesty required for such a comedy role. Most of the greatest actors are very good in comedies&#151;Gabin was ,and Brando, and Newman, and Bogart, and Gable, Mastroianni, Fresnay, Belmondo, Jouvet, of course Welles &#133;.Previously, Rourke already had allowed brief glimpses of his comic gusto&#151;in Nine 1/2 Weeks (1986),in Barfly (1987);and there was,of course,his '84 cult comedy, his _cultest film,if I may term it like that &#133;.He had brio, charm, enough instinctive finesse, much brio, a luminous intelligence. Yet, he was not offered much in the area of the comedy as a genre, in the Hollywoodian labeling system (I wish he would have accepted the lead in BH COP &#133;--still, when I did mention this, once, to a young woman, she answered&#151;'He could not be a clown').I do not know if he would have made better things than Willis in the comedy; yet, it was worth a try &#133;.

Harley Davidson and the Marlboro Man is a perfect example of that. It's a down and dirty sleazeball flick that is just so fun. Mickey Rourke plays Harley, a biker cowboy on a steel horse who makes his way back to a slightly futuristic LA to reconnect with his old barfly friends, including the rodeo riding Marlboro Man (Don Johnson). Rourke claims he only did this one for the dough, but I call bullshit. He has such a ball with his leathery tan, cocky prick attitude and spiked hair it's impossible he wasn't invested, even in a purely camp form. Don Johnson is slick and deadly as his trigger happy buddy Marlboro. Between quips, fist and gunfights, smoking and boozing, they try to exact revenge on the tyrannical big city banker (Tom Sizemore) who laid waste to their friends inner city bar. Sizemore is no stranger to dangerous, mean spirited roles, and he plays the megalomaniac financier with a razor sharp, homicidal calm that's giddily entertaining. A young Tia Carrere shows up as his sultry assistant, as well as work from Daniel Baldwin, Kelly Hu, Vanessa Angel and Chelsea Field. It's no smart action flick, but it's a brutal, tongue in cheek modern western with dusty, broken glass and whiskey soaked style that will entertain anyone who has nostalgia for that era of action movies.

I suspect one can use that statement as a barometer for gauging their interest in this particular film (no disrespect intended, Mr. Johnson).Mickey Rourke and Don Johnson star as the titular characters, respectively. When their favorite bar comes under threat of foreclosure, the two cowboys hatch a scheme to rob the bank for the $2.5 million needed for the lease renewal. But instead of money, the truck is carrying Crystal Dream - a high-potency drug of the future. Harley and Marlboro run into more trouble when the owner of the bank (bad-guy-for-hire Tom Sizemore) sends gunmen (led by the bored Daniel Baldwin) to recover his stolen drugs.Essentially a modern re-telling of Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid, Harley Davidson and the Marlboro Man takes place (primarily) in a not-too-distant future Los Angeles (5 years, to be exact), where hit men wear Kevlar trenchcoats, cars have barcode license plates, and the city of Burbank is an international airport.The film has the look and feel of your average early '90s action movie, although said action proceeds in fits and starts. And it doesn't help matters that the villains don't seem very threatening. I think this is where the film suffers most from a lackluster script. Tom Sizemore is fantastic at playing annoyed, but doesn't go any further than that. And Daniel Baldwin is just a stalking robot with a big gun, but his glassy-eyed stare gives the impression that he'd rather be somewhere else. Mickey Rourke has the same problem. It's my understanding that Rourke took the role for the money (and now regrets that decision) ... and it shows. Rourke's just going through the motions here. Any camaraderie that the lead characters are supposed to have suffers for this reason. Don Johnson's the only one having any fun here. He's the charming of the two, invests some energy into his character and he tends to steal every one of his scenes because of it. Indeed, Johnson ends up looking like the only one who cares about what is otherwise just a paycheck movie. Still, the film retains a certain watchability. I still can't put my finger on why, but for a film that, on its surface, seems like a disposable affair, I still wouldn't mind sitting through it again. Mostly for Don Johnson.6.5/10 "},{"Title":"It's a good day for dying.

I was still a pro wrestling fan back then, so seeing Big John Studd would have been a treat. Except for being overweight, he looked better and younger here, well after his wrestling career was over. I had to wonder though what happened to his cauliflowered forehead from all those blading jobs he did back then. So now you fast forward to the late 2000's and Mickey Rourke actually becomes The Wrestler and it's like coming full circle.I was reading the other reviews on this site, and was intrigued by the number of comparisons given Rourke and Don Johnson to Redford and Newman. I had the same thought while watching the film, but not because this was such a great buddy film. The story actually ripped off two Butch Cassidy and The Sundance Kid gimmicks - the 'Who are you guys?' line, and the buddy jump off the cliff to escape the posse. As far as their buddy chemistry went, I'm not convinced they were as tight as Butch and Sundance, and certainly not in the same league.As for action and plot, this one's been done dozens of times, and at best is passable for a couple of hours of light entertainment. I was probably most intrigued by the movie references made by all the memorabilia in the Old Man's bar, especially the poster and statue honoring John Wayne's Hondo. It seems I just saw a film with another Hondo poster in it not too long ago - The Man With Bogart's Face. One of the benefits of being an attentive movie fan.Anyway, I was never a big Don Johnson fan, and as for Rourke, it looked like he was doing Bruce Willis here just a couple of years after Willis got his big movie break with Die Hard. Suffice it to say that this was no crystal dream, and if I might point to another buddy flick, Tango and Cash, this one might not quite have been FUBAR, but it was pretty close.

Are you serious? Is somebody having a laugh? Come on, surely you can do better than that! Was this meant to be some sort of comedy? No. Is this just a rough and tumble action movie? Meant to be. Does it fail? In every way, yes. The dialogue is atrocious, and all the action scenes are poorly executed and unrealistic.I have nothing against Mickey Rourke and Don Johnson, but I wish that they could have teamed up in a better movie. It's good to see Mickey Rourke have his career resurrected after the success of the critically acclaimed 2008 movie The Wrestler for which he was deservedly nominated for an Academy Award for Best Actor. Don Johnson, famously known for his role in Miami Vice, enjoyed success with the TV show Nash Bridges in the late 90's before popping up here and there with lesser known movies and TV shoes and small roles in such movies as Machete (2010) and Django Unchained (2013).Keep an eye out for Tom Sizemore (Heat, Saving Private Ryan, Black Hawk Down), Vanessa Williams (Eraser, TV's Ugly Betty), Tia Carrere (True Lies) and Giancarlo Esposito (Gus Fring in Breaking Bad) in small roles.It was no surprise this was a critical and box office failure back in 1991, although this has since become a cult classic following its release to home video.

From guys having a good time, organising a heist that goes wrong (not money, but drugs&#x85; whoops) and then finding them on the run for it. Having strong protagonists is one thing (though you could say Rourke and Johnson do feel like they were on cruise control), but they do carry this one along, where as having weak villains is downright criminal. A less than imposing Tom Sizemore is wasted, despite being the main corporate villain oozing with confidence, while Daniel Baldwin just lacked any sort of punch even though looking the part decked in black leather as a henchman. Even the bit players come and go with little to no impact. Julius Harris adds some class, while there's amusing playful parts for Big John Studd and Giancarlo Esposito. Then the likes of Chelsea Field, Vanessa Williams, Tia Carrere and Robert Ginty's characters felt like secondary inclusions to add something ala filler, which probably could have been scrapped from its bloated script. Director Simon Wincer gives it slick technical treatment (crafty cinematography) and aplomb in it's vigorously over exaggerated action set-pieces and stunt-work, but its liveliness couldn't hide its generic score, banal story structure and silly plotting. A mindless popcorn action romp with its two stars having a ball. It's better to be dead and cool, than alive and uncool. "},{"Title":"Hey, kids!

Harley and Marlboro (let's call them Bike and Fag for short) decide the only way their friend can afford the exorbitant rent on his bar is by robbing a bank. Presumably a certain amount of planning went into this heist but we, the audience, are privy too none of it. Having successfully diverted an armoured car (manned by the world's two worst security guards), our heroes are in the midst of transferring their loot when a car filled with serious looking dudes in full-length Kevlar suits and machine-guns turns up. It's these men &#x96; not the law, who are nowhere to be seen throughout the film &#x96; who track our boys down for the rest of the movie. Actually what I wrote about the lack of law in the film isn't quite true - there's some love interest for Fag in the shapely form of a policewoman (instead of a teacher), who is getting a little tired of his wandering ways, which was presumably an attempt on the part of the writers to inject a little pathos into the proceedings.I felt quite sorry for Mickey Rourke (Bike) and Don Johnson (Fag) here.

It's then the two end up in a shootout at an old airplane graveyard. Harley and the Marlboro man finally figured out to aim for the heads of the bank security men instead of their bodies, that were protected by their bullet-proof Japanese Kevlar overcoats, and put Alexander and his band away. This after the Marlboro Man ends up badly wounded.Big confrontation with bank president Wilder and his sexy secretary Kimiko,Tia Carrere,in his L.A office With an armed helicopter pilot friend of Harley and the Marlboro Man getting the drop on Wilder almost blasting him, and his back-clothed security goons, out of the building. This then lead to a cliff hanging slug fest between Wilder and the Marlboro Man. With Wilder hanging on for dear life he soon fell some 30 stories to his death when the Marlboro Man's torn and scotch-taped boot, that Wilder was holding on to, gave way.With their adventures, and the movie, just about over the Marlboro Man goes back to his first love, riding wild bulls at the local rodeo.

This movie, while set in the near future (when it was released), follows the style of a classic western movie. It is about a couple of drifters, cowboys, Harley Davidson, the new style of cowboy riding his Harley and wearing his leather jacket, and the Malboro Man, a classic cowboy with his boots and his hat.The narrative of this film is similar to the old style westerns, but in many ways goes to show that nothing has changed and nothing will change. We see that despite progress (the world now flies into and out of Burbank Airport) the west is still lawless and has still been left behind. Chance Wilder, the antagonist of the piece, only earns $500,000 a year as the head of the bank (most likely the Los Angeles branch), and has to supplement his income in other ways.The west is still lawless, and while the police to appear, they tend to take a back seat. Virginia Slim (a type of cigarette) is Malboro's girl, and while she works for the police, she has no idea about what is going on, nor does her partner. Instead, it is still the law of the gun, as can be seen by the thugs that carry out Wilder's dirty work.The cowboy still drifts, as we see Harley drifting from east to go out west, though not to make his fortune, and then drifts back east at the end of the film. However the east and west division between civilisation and barbarity is still evident as they jump on a train back east when things get too hot, though returns to the west to finish off the unfinished business.In essence this movie is about the American culture, the main characters representing the motor bike and the cigarette, with Virginia Slim being the feminine Marlboro. Throw in Jack Daniels, the the big guy who is representative of tough, but ugly guy that you don't want to upset. It is all about taming that which is wild. The cowboy rides the bull, which is in essence the duty and nature of the cowboy, to go into the wilderness and bring civilisation there. Yet this is also evident when we see the woman on the bike in the bar, in the same way the cowboy is taming the wild beast. I guess this demonstrates the American Narrative, that in one sense, looking from the east, the west is still a wild and untame place, but even now that the West has been won, there is always new horizons and new frontiers that need to be tamed.

There are few finer exponents of 'macho cool' in Hollywood than Mickey Rourke and Don Johnson; they both have the same grit and craggy weatherbeaten air that suggests they've lived a tumultuous life about ten times over; so there's surely no two better people to cast as a pair of cool, jaded outlaws? This is a movie that wears it's brawling credentials proudly on its sleeve, and acts as a kind of sad and ironic late goodbye to the unselfconscious action pictures that characterised the 80's decade. It opts to play its masculinity completely straight even as the viewers themselves are aware that it's faintly ridiculous. In that sense, it reminded me a whole lot of Road House - Good, cheesy fun.It takes a special kind of skill to deliver what might seem risible dialogue in a deadpan way, and both Rourke and Johnson have it, which makes this film a really enjoyable experience, if by no means a masterpiece.

I remember watching it for the first time some ten or fifteen years ago, after reading about it in a martial arts magazine, if memory serves.Plot outline - Biker Harley Davidson (Mickey Rourke), aside with the bike-riding rodeo cowboy Marlboro Man (Don Johnson) and a few other small time crooks robs a money transport, which turns out to be a big mistake when they find out that they got more than they bargained for. And all hell breaks loose...The story of this movie isn't too complicated, but it contains a lot of fighting, gunfire and explosions. Which seem reasonable, since it is an action flick, and therefore should be judged as such, and not compared to other movies with more solid and refined story lines and so on. And as pure action, it is great. Mickey Rourke does a great job portraying the biker who turns out to be a less-than-proficient marksman who couldn't hit a barn even with a sniper scope. Don Johnson does very well as a gun-slinging cowboy - especially since his weapon of choice is a .44 cal Desert Eagle, not the most handy or practical handgun on the market - who would fit in any classical western movie. Together they form a must-be-seen-to-believed duo.To me, this is Rourke's finest performance on the silver screen up to this date - although I have a feeling that this one went straight to the video shelves - and Don Johnson does a great job too, even though I've only seen him in Miami Vice as well as a couple of other movies. We also see a young - and thin - Daniel Baldwin as the goon in charge, and Tom Sizemore as the mobster posing as a respectable business man, with Tia Carrere as his sidekick/secretary.All in all, and as an action flick, this is as good as any other. Movies in this category often get rather low ratings, and in my eyes the problem is that they aren't judged for what they are, and not compared to other action flicks. Yes, the storyline could be summed up in a few sentences, but come on, that's what action is about - Action. Bullets flying, fists pounding, vehicles exploding. If I want to watch a good drama or thriller, I watch a good drama or thriller. I don't watch an action movie and then complain that it wasn't like any good drama or thriller.I give it 6 out of 10 bullets.

He finally got me with one Harley Davidson and the Marlboro Man. I had never heard about it, but he told me that Mickey Rourke was in it; I got excited because I loved Mickey in 9 1/2 Weeks and was hoping for the same kind of performance in Harley Davidson and the Marlboro Man. Now the funny thing is that I made my boyfriend watch 9 1/2 Weeks with the smooth operator Mickey and I watched Harley Davidson and the Marlboro Man scary motorcycle Mickey. But onto the movie and wither it was good or not. Now actually, Harley Davidson and the Marlboro Man wasn't at all a bad movie, it's better than most I would say. It's actually a cool action movie and has a decent story despite it's unusual title.Harley Davidson and Marlboro are buddies way back, together they ride their motorcycles on a care free life. But when they go back to the bar that they love so much, they find out that a bank is about to replace it unless the owner, Jimmy, comes up with two and a half million dollars to cover the cost. Harley and Marlboro decide to rob the very bank that is taking the bar away with some of their friends, they think they got away with it when they do, but it turns out that the truck they stole that they thought had the money has drugs instead. So they make a deal with the evil guy from the bank and get the money for the drugs; they just did one thing wrong, they trust the evil super duper bad guy too well.Harley Davidson and the Marlboro Man is good cheesy fun that was kinda fun to watch, sometimes you need the typical and predictable action movie that just has the great exciting scenes to make you at least be entertained. Both Mickey and Jon seemed to have a lot of fun together and I would say clicked very well. I loved how Marlboro was trying to teach Harley how to shoot his gun, and well, it comes in handy at the end to actually make for some dark comedy jokes, but I'm not going to tell you what happens.

I loved it","Date":"6 December 2004","Score":"1 out of 6 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Crime, Drama","Review":" These guys play a great role as Harley and Marlboro. It is a great action / comedy for anyone out there who likes this kind of genre... I really can't explain much without ruining the movie. But this one is very unique, because Harley and his friends are so extremely calm over everything they do, it makes this movie absolutely unique. Some great one liners in this movie as well. I definitely recommend watching it. A true Classic. and it definitely deserves more than a 5, i give it an 8.5 at least... People today are warped with all the new 04 movies and cannot appreciate a good classic anymore, It seems that anything made before 2003 gets bad ratings, but i feel anything made after 99 have had too much computer graphics done and lack the true skills of good acting. Everyone is into fantasy these days and no one can appreciate a good old style fashion action. This is one of the last good ones out there. i don't know how people can watch Crap with more computer effects and blue screens than actual acting. Matrix is a good example... if anyone wants a good keeanu movie, watch point blank or bill and teds. keep the classics alive by renting this one and don't stop here, check out other greats, like One Man Army starring Dolph Lundgren or American Ninja. starring Michael Dudikoff "},{"Title":"Insanely Good","Date":"26 August 2003","Score":"1 out of 6 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Crime, Drama","Review":"  In my opinion you can't say enough good things about this film. Don Johnson and Mickey Roark are all over it turning in the best and second best performances of their lives respectively. At the height of it's genre this buddy-action-adventure-romance-caper-distopian future-comedy is an edge of your seat laugh a minute thrill ride with a heart of gold and duct taped boots.  "},{"Title":"Bar brawls, bank robbers, motorcycles, cowboys, big boobs, and a pack of cigarettes the man's man movie.","Date":"9 January 2005","Score":"4 out of 13 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Crime, Drama","Review":" Harley Davidson and the Malboro Man had the potential to be a pretty decent Man's Man movie, but it took too long to get started. Then, once it did get good, and the story got interesting, it fails at about the point our heroes and their relentless nemeses decided to be too invincible. Harley Davidson (Mickey Rourke) and the Malboro Man (Don Johnson, hubba! hubba!) are the subject of our story as two loner heroes. Their rugged terrain in their Texas town, one that motorcycle riders and cowboys love--dirt roads, dust, etc--is being overrun by skyscrapers. Amidst their routine bar brawl and pool hustling, they learn that their close friend's bar, the 'Rock N' Roll Bar', is facing a tough financial crises because, with all the development in town, rents are on the rise. The bar owner's five year lease is now $2.5 million, and without it, his landlord is threatening to shut him down. So, Harley Davidson gets the bonehead idea that he and his buddies, including Malboro Man should rob the bank. Only, what they steal turns out to be blue bricks of Crystal Dream. The bank CEO (I guess that's what he is), played by Tom Seizemore, orders his three invincible goons in bulletproof Matrix-like trench coats to get back their stash--no matter what. Harley Davidson and Malboro Man think they're just going to hold the junk ransom and order that the bank goons pay $2.5 million and that will be the end of it. No way.****SPOILERS BEYOND**** There's too many far-fetched action sequences that for me, ruined the makings of a pretty decent action flick. For example, when Harley and Malboro stow away on a plane to Las Vegas, their trench coat-wearing nemeses still magically find them. Even know the hotel where they're staying and what floor they're on. Then, Harley and Malboro, having to run for cover on the roof, decide that it would be a good idea to jump off the hotel into a swimming pool. Jumping from that height into a pool of water would be the equivalent of jumping onto concrete. They would have never survived the fall. Harley Davidson and Malboro Man (except for the very end for Malboro Man) never ever get shot despite the fusillade of gunfire they always manage to step into. The villains always carry around something like Uzi's and the heroes carry around plain old handguns. But they never get hit. There's that part in the airport graveyard where, even though one of the guys is wearing the bulletproof trench coat, and Harley and Malboro know they have to shoot him in the head, they still pierce his chest with bullets despite the trench coat. The end is even more ridiculous as Tom Seizemore is hanging out of the window by the heel of his shoe. I was just starting to enjoy the movie before all of that happened. But, that's basically what you're in for. So, if you like a movie with bar brawls, pool hustlers, boobs, motorcylces, and shoot outs, and can still have fun with it, despite all of those incredulous flaws, then this movie is probably good for you. I thought it was only half good. "}]
