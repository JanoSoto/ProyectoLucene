[{"Title":"Great Movie","Date":"16 December 2004","Score":"60 out of 67 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy","Review":" I've enjoyed this movie ever since I first saw it in the theatre. Some movies have a cast of characters and a script that come together in perfect synergy, and this is one of them. The characters illustrate some truths about getting the best out of people, working together harmoniously, building a team and achieving goals, without ever preaching morality. The situations are crafted well and are consistent with the movie's opening premise. The tension builds nicely and the humor is clean and consistent throughout. The movie manages to pull me right in to root for the characters, and to laugh pretty well all the way through. This is a feel good movie as good as they come.What amazes me is that a movie which appears so simple can be so long term entertaining. The music is a perfect copy of music in the typical serious post war navy movies, which helps to create the humor and point out that greatness is in the eye of the beholder. The scenes in the credits are a great music video of In the Navy, which deserve their own full screen special feature. The scenes and cuts are crafted well, and the casting and acting is right on.This movie is a classic as great as any ever made, without any pretensions. In fact, the lack of pretension is what makes it so much fun to watch. I love these guys and gal.The other day I thought of the film, and wondered whether it was available on DVD. Good fortune has come to us, and the DVD came out in May 2004. I headed to the store, and snapped up a copy. Then my wife and I enjoyed another hilarious night in front of the big screen. I've rated this movie as a 10 because it comes together on all levels, far better than many high budget films and Oscar winners. This is entertainment.Listen up Fox home video you have a great movie in your vaults, and it's a shame to find a cheap shot DVD with badly degraded off tint colors only 8 years since release. So why not restore the colors and present the film as it was meant to be seen? I'd gladly pay a few bucks more to get the picture right. I'm grateful to have my own copy. Now give us the eye candy that the film deserves, and how about recreating the credit sequence as a full screen music video special feature.

This movie is practically McHale's Navy for the 90s or Police Academy at sea. Grammer proves he can play roles other than Frasier as he outwits and outfoxes the Navy in order to get his own sub. Rob Schneider is as wormy as usual, the same in every role he plays, and Lauren Holly is the local sexpot albeit with a brain. Ken Hudson Campbell is as funny as usual with almost every line a catch phrase. The movie has a wonderful intelligent plot and a non-predictable script that still surprises me every time I watch it. Many of the Navy phrases and terms go over my head, though, but it's a small obstacle for the sheer accuracy and realism of the movie and its characters.

I remember how I laughed much more than I expected.  I haven't watched the film until it came out on cable TV recently.  Even though I knew the plot and many of the jokes, I still found myself laughing as hard as when I first saw it.  I was pleasantly surprised that the movie still had an appeal after all these years and many of the actors in the film did a great job without being overly done. Kelsey Grammer, in particular, played a very likeable commander and even though he had the goofiest men under his command, Grammer brought out the best in each of them.This movie is much more believeable to watch than any of the Police Academy movies.  Being a former Navy vet myself, the language made sense to me and after watching a super serious thriller like U-571 recently,  Down Periscope still kept within the framework of what is acceptable and believeable within the Navy.  If you haven't seen this film, I highly recommend it for pure entertainment and escapism.

One common theme was you can have a great script, great cast, the best director and lots of money and still create a bad movie.Down Periscope is proof of the corollary to that theory. Not an original or terribly well written screenplay. A few solid actors, but mostly unknowns, and this movie just makes you laugh out loud! It would be easy to just say that Kelsey Grammar carried this movie, but that isn't truly the case. Other character actors, like Rob Schneider, and the hilarious Harland Williams, added significantly to the enjoyability of the film.Cast dynamics, or that mysterious movie magic are really what happened here, creating a film that flows smoothly, has incredibly well executed transitions and line after line of well written and well performed dialog.A preposterous premise, lots and lots of technical inaccuracies and just plan silly things that could not happen in the real world, or the real navy, but you just don't care. As a merchant marine myself, I found that the overall feel of the movie, while not plausible, was also not too far off the mark as far as life at sea goes.This is a VERY funny movie, a good family film, and, particularly if your a fan, lots of Kelsey Grammar wit, sarcasm and just damn funniness.

At least for most members of my family that is. One of us rolls our eyes at the mention of this movie and thinks, What a stupid movie. I'm not that person though. I still find this movie highly amusing. I just watched it again last night with someone who had never seen it, and I laughed just as hard as the first time I watched it. It's still very funny to me.Naval Captain Tom Dodge (Grammar) is a bit of a black sheep in the navy. He's the kind of guy who will play golf while on a sub, cracking a ball onto a golf course while they sail past it. He's the kind of guy who will get drunk, pass out, and wake up with a hangover and a tattoo on his dongle. He's not the kind of guy that everybody wants to be commanding a sub.But Dodge is at the end of the line. He's put in applications to get command of his own sub several times, and if he doesn't get a sub this time, he's headed for a desk job, meaning that's it for naval life. The Admiralty decide to give him his own boat, but they don't give him a new nuclear sub. They give him a diesel sub, an ancient relic from World War II. His mission is to clean her up and take her out on the Atlantic for a war game.Dodge is obviously a little bit frustrated to have such a crappy boat given to him when he's worked so hard to get to the point that he's at, so he goes and talks to Admiral Winslow (Torn) about it. Winslow explains the purpose of the war game. Diesel subs are still being sold out there in the real world, to countries like Iran, Iraq, and Libya, to name a few. Winslow wants to know what would happen if some renegade captain in a diesel sub came to the States and tried to smuggle a nuclear warhead into one of the bases. Would they make it? Dodge and most of the Admiralty don't think so, but Winslow wants to know for sure, hence why he has devised this war game. Dodge's mission is to take the Stingray out to sea, then try to evade the U.S. nuclear navy and blow up the American naval bases. In simulated battle, of course.So, that's about as deep as the plot gets. This is not a plot driven movie. It's a stupid movie that is just a big gag. It makes fun of itself, and you are not expected to take it seriously. If you're looking for good dumb laughs on a Friday night, I'd urge you to check it out.Bottom Line 3 out of 4 (worth a look) "}{"Title":"Stunning, prophetic, and ahead of its time","Date":"25 April 2005","Score":"6 out of 6 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy","Review":" LCDR Tom Dodge, despite having a reputation among submariners as a renegade and maverick (*note to reader Maverick does not mean Tom Cruise.

The Vice-Admiral is concerned about our old friends the Russians hosting yard sales with their old diesel fleets. Countries like Lybia, North Korea or Iraq would love to get their hands on this baby and slip a nuclear warhead into Norfolk Harbour or Mayport, Florida. And this was 6-7 years before 9/11.The Admiral assigns Dodge to assume command of a moth-balled WWII diesel sub and mount an exercise against the surface fleet and the USS ORLANDO, a top of the line fast attack sub. Dodge takes command and in no time whips up the bad news bears.. err I mean his lovable group of oddball submariners into warriors. Despite having welcome aboard tattooed on his penis, he is a competent and fair commander, he does not choose favorites and he delegates authority in a responsible manner.

He gave him a battered but still seaworthy Balao-class sub, and assigns him the task of using the diesel sub to evade the nuclear Navy and 'attack' Charlston Harbor, and Norfolk. 2-star Admiral Graham (with his eye on his third star, and a grudge against Dodge) assigned him the ragtag crew, hoping that they would screw up so Dodge would lose.

The characters in the movie were colorful and fun, although most of them were somewhat unfit for naval duty, I think, but that just added to the comedy aspect.One of my favorite scenes is during a silent run, the cook rips a massive fart that smells horribly.

When he is given one, against the advice of Rear Admiral Graham, it is an old diesel sub.  In an attempt to prove that the US is vulnerable to a terrorist strike from the old diesel-type subs being sold on the black market, Admiral Winslow sets up a war game with Graham &#150; that a diesel sub can evade capture long enough to enter a port and launch an attack on US soil.  To hinder him further Graham gives Dodge a crew of useless sailors and sets him on his way.  However, as the first few skirmishes show, Dodge is perhaps resourceful enough to pull it off.I watched this on a lazy Bank Holiday afternoon &#150; and I think that that is the best way to watch it.  If you made a special trip to the cinema to see this I think you'd be upset but to find it on TV is just about right.  The plot is daft but allows for an inventive (if silly) film that has a little bit of excitement to it (just don't expect Crimson Tide here).  The laughs are rarely out loud but the atmosphere is more one of amusement than laughter.  Like I said &#150; it works if you don't expect much.Considering the material, the film did well to get a reasonable cast on board (sorry).  Grammer is OK and seems to enjoy being out of his Fraiser mode &#150; but he isn't that convincing carrying a film instead of a show.  The support cast throws up plenty of well known faces.  Lauren Holly has little to do but looks good doing it!  Seeing her in an uniform 2 sizes too small is perhaps the high point for many viewers!  Schneider always makes me think of a poor man's comedy side kick and he doesn't do that well here, but to be fair he tries hard with his character.  Getting names like Macy, Dern Stanton and Rip Torn in the film was a shrewd move as they are always watchable, but they really have little to do.Overall this is not that funny and not that clever.  However if you know what you're watching (a daft amusing movie) then you'll be pleased if not overjoyed by it.  I was doing laundry on a day off work and it did me just fine to distract without having to focus on it.

I docked it eight stars for being one of the most agonizing films I've ever sat through in a theater. That's right, I saw this more than ten years ago when it came out, and remember it to this day because it was so bad.Close to none of the jokes caused a change in the silence of the audience. At one point somebody even booed a joke it was so crappy. I remember actually counting the seconds of awkwardness after some jokes where the movie almost seemed to pause, hoping for the laughter that would never come.This movie would have done much better as a drama that had extremely mild comic relief, if only the premise weren't corny already. I'm surprised Kelsey Grammar got any work after this, because absent his deep baritone he obviously can't carry a movie on his own.

I nearly fell asleep during it. If it wasn't for the fact that I was with someone else, I would have left before it was over, which I've only been inclined to do during two other theater movies. Given Kelsey's long career of higher-brow humor I was surprised by the low-brow humor.One of my least favorite movies. Might be OK for a 12-year-old boy who is easily entertained. If you are interested in this sort of thing, I recommend the old McHale's Navy TV program instead.

A navy captain with a reputation of irresponsibility is given the unenviable assignment of commanding an old WWII diesel sub.  He and his misfit crew are tasked with infiltrating Norfolk Harbor in a war game.  Can they do it?  What to you think?

I am a Kelsey Grammar fan and was looking forward to enjoying his form of witty humor when it premiered in theaters. Instead, I was bored to death by stupid, juvenile slapstick and bathroom humor - the opposite of what Grammar excels at.Not one person in the audience uttered a single laugh during this agonizingly boring film. The inclusion of Rob Schneider, who is the embodiment of puerile humor, makes perfect sense, but Grammar should have avoided this one like the plague. This film was so unexpectedly bad that its memory inspired me to register here to warn other Grammar fans. I can only imagine that he must not have read the script before he accepted the part or he was desperate to accept his first leading movie role.

It was likable enough, but the laughs were few and far between, and the plot was as predictable as it gets.  With a few more good jokes, I might have been able to recommend this picture, but instead I can only call it a decent time-killer at best.  Ultimately, I think that most people will find it to be just another forgettable film.

A couple of misfits (a la police academy) in an old submarine, under leadership of miscasted Grammer (who apparently has a tattoo on his you know what, the source of more than half of the 'jokes' in this movie) play war games against cocky general with new submarine. Sound familiar? Boring and totally not funny. 2/10 "}]
