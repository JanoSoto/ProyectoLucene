Not just the Anglo, but the Asian and West Indian perspectives. Even the Southeast Asian view. The Middle Easterners have shown great strides with movies like Bend It Like Beckham and a few others. This movie got away from me until recently. I saw in the library video section and decided to check it out. The box is very misleading. They put a young interracial couple, front and center on the cover when actually their subplot is very peripheral to the story. I guess the movie studio figured they'd get a wider audience interested with younger faces on the cover since the main characters look to be in their 50s.George Khan (Om Puri) has left his native Pakistan to live in the UK with its soveriegnty ties. Though he has a wife back in his homeland (she is only mentioned, not seen), he marries a white Englishwoman, Ella (Lynda Bassett). They have 7 kids 6 boys and 1 girl. Flash forward to the late 60s (where the movie actually begins) and we see his kids are truly English in behavior though he stresses that they must go to Mosque to study and worship. His oldest is to be wed in an arranged marriage to a woman he hardly knows. He runs out in the middle of the ceremony in fear, embarrassing his family especially his father who disowns him. This sets the tone of the movie. His kids are English-born and want to live like their friends in their working-class neighborhood but George wants to raise them as traditional Muslims, despite opposition from his wife, Ella, who only wants the kids to be happy. She tries to help them avoid run-ins with their father who despite his cheerfulness is quite an ogre when angered. The kids range in attitude and indifference toward George's attempts to introduce them to the traditional ways. This is a decent introduction to immigrant life in the UK especially since it's set during a time when there was political strife over immigration of non-whites into Britain. Though it's an effective comedy, it also touches on the frustration immigrants of any culture go through to hold onto or reject their identity. The only thing marring this movie is a domestic violence scene that may bother some. Still a very good movie worth seeing.

George Khan is a Muslim who, upon immigrating to Great Britain in 1937, married a British woman despite the fact that his first wife still lives in Pakistan.  Now, twenty five years later, the still happily married couple lives in a small apartment with their daughter and six sons all of whom have been raised to honor their father's religion and traditions.  Yet, like Tevye, George is suddenly confronted with the fact that, as times change and the world moves on, the younger generation will no longer abide by the archaic rituals of an ancient age.  In many ways, this is the flip side of `Fiddler' in that here the reluctant marriage partners are sons and not daughters.  For indeed, George's ultimate goal in life is to arrange marriages for his teenaged sons within the accepted tradition of the Muslim faith.  But culture is often a force that parents try in vain to withstand and these children, raised in the far more open and liberated society of `mod' England, are not about to take such dictatorial parental control lying down.In the script based on his play, Ayub Khan-Din provides an evenhanded and comprehensive view of the situation.  George is not presented to us as an inflexible or unreasonable ogre, yet at the same time, he will, in his frustration, strike out even physically at the children and the wife who seem to oppose him.  We sense the fear that runs through him that, if his sons are allowed to exercise their freedom in this one crucial area, the family will sever that connection with the past which brings stability to their lives.  Thus, without any traditions to anchor them, George dreads that he and the family will be cut adrift in a seemingly rudderless world that suddenly seems in the 1970's to be in such great and terrifying moral flux.  Moreover, we are left to ponder the strange contradiction between George's own words and the choices he himself has made.  After all, his opting to marry a British woman who does not share the tenets of his faith obviously went beyond the bounds of the very traditions he is now so dogmatically insisting his sons uphold.  This type of ambiguity within the characters enhances their credibility, for indeed life and the people we meet therein come replete with such maddening inconsistencies.Khan-Din and director Damien O'Donnell establish an effective balance between low-key humor and occasionally searing drama.  The relationship between the husband and wife who comprise this interracial marriage is complexly realized and fully drawn; the obvious difficulties the two have experienced as a result of the nonconformity of their union has obviously strengthened their devotion to one another and they appear to greatly enjoy each other's company.  She has undoubtedly made any number of concessions and compromises to her husband's belief system, yet she has retained her British feistiness and knows how far to let George go before she draws the line, especially when it comes to protecting the rights and happiness of her own progeny.   In a similar way, we see, in thorough detail, the complexities that make up the two very different sets of relationships between the respective parents and their children.  Din and O'Donnell have, wisely, chosen to limit the scope of their film by downplaying the broader theme of how a suspicious and prejudiced society deals with so unconventional a marriage and family.  We see only bits and pieces of this in the form of bigoted comments uttered by a disapproving neighbor and a mere mention of a political rally intended to rouse the populace on the issue of `repatriation.'   Instead, the authors concentrate almost exclusively on the internecine struggles taking place within this one family.   This helps to keep the scale of the film life-sized, thus enhancing our identification with the characters and their universal parent/child conflicts.  For, in a way, the Khan family is really not undergoing any crisis not already familiar to countless families the world over, as parents cope with children eager to cut the filial chords and establish life on their own terms and as children, likewise, deal with parents who want to determine the course those lives will take.  The Khans just happen to provide a more heightened and intensified view of this subject.`East is East' is a small movie but an absorbing one.  Thanks to uniformly excellent performances from a gifted cast and a careful modulation between humor and drama, the film emerges as a compelling and insightful glimpse into a life that is, as for all of us, so full of both terrifying and wonderful complexity.

Traditional dad Om Puri is shocked when his oldest son (Ian Aspinall) runs away from an arranged wedding, and decides that from now on his family will be more respectful. Among his plans are the weddings of two of his other sons, both of whom are far from delighted with the idea. Khan-Din's fine script never resorts to cliche resulting in a funny, study of the clash between the old and the new.Linda Bassett as superb as Puri's second wife, an English woman who straddles both camps between her husband's traditionalism and her kids' sense of rebellion while nonetheless attempting to keep her own dignity.Fine performances from Chris Bisson and Jimmi Harkishin (Coronation Street) and Jimi Mistry (EastEnders) while little Jordan Routledge is great as the parka-loving Sajid.However, it's Puri who shines as the complex father, desperately trying to hang on to tradition and finding nothing but rebellion from his family.The ending could easily have been a familiar family seeks revenge on their overbearing father but what results is a refreshing change to the many TV movies that usually opt for an easy solution to a difficult problem.

Suddenly they hear a door opening and immediately start cleaning up all of the dishes and unsuccessfully try to get rid of the fumes of grilled bacon and sausages that billowed through the whole house. This is, of course, not depicting the normal life of three teenagers, but taken from the film East Is East by Damien O'Donnell. It deals with the story of a family in England in the 1970s with a Pakistani father (multi-facetted enacted by Om Puri) who still believes in his Pakistani traditions and his Muslim religion and an English mother (great performance by Linda Bassett) who tries to give her seven children as much freedom as all of their fully English friends enjoy. This movie was labeled as a Comedy both in theaters and on DVD or VHS, but anybody looking for light-hearted entertainment fitting for a Saturday night will be hugely disappointed. This movie is out to teach the viewer about how difficult it is to get two very different cultures to not only co-exist peacefully next to each other, but to merge them to create a new one. The script by Ayub Khan-Din, who also wrote the book and the stage version of this movie, does have its funny moments, and the whole cast, including the children, is in for some good laughs. But the more intense moments are those where the viewer has to deal with outbursts of domestic violence or things like arranged marriages that seem so far away and cruel to Westerners. The cast shows its brilliance in those intimate moments. Even though the script might sometimes appear to be too ambitious &#150; there are just too many characters all developing in a very distinct manner and all crucial to the movie &#150; the movie can be recommended to anyone who is not looking for a standard comedy and is willing to have his views on life challenged.

These were my first thoughts when I heard that this film will be the next topic our English class has to deal with. But that is absolutely not the case! This film is a great enrichment for the viewer and it is no boring stuff at all.Ayub Khan-Din wrote a fantastic script which is perfectly put into action by Damien O'Donnell. The cast members did a good job by giving their characters influences to link them into the right direction. For example Om Puri who played his complex character George Khan with such a conviction and even the youngest cast member Jordan Routledge who has absolutely not to hide behind his co-cast members in his performance of &#132;Sajid Khan. Also the setting in the 70's is a big success so that you get the impression as if you are living within this time. Mostly I liked the way the writers handled the difficult topic of the different lifestyles of Pakistani and British people without speaking in favour for one group. They used a lot of prejudices about both cultures but they converted it into funny scenes everybody has to laugh about. So a good balance between comedy and tragedy is created because of the spontaneous comic relieves. The film gives a good opportunity for watching it for entertainment but also for talking seriously about it, like for example the two generations and their different points of view On the one hand we can see the young generation of Sajid who does not care if his friend Earnest is a Pakistani or not. And also Tariq who does not want to be a devout Pakistani and likes partying all night even if his father gets angry about it. But on the other hand, there is the older generation of immigrants George belongs to which is extremely influenced by their traditional values and it is hard for them to adapt to the British society. It seems as if especially George does not learn from his mistakes After the failed arranged marriage of eldest son Nazir, he tries to plan marriages for his sons Tariq and Abdul who are strongly against it. At the end, left alone from his family, George seems to be contemplative and Ella goes back to him for reconciliation. But the viewer does not get to know whether George changes his behaviour or not but you can still hope it! And that's why East is East is such an intoxicating movie Everybody can identify with one of the characters and so you suffer with Ella when she is beaten up by her husband, you laugh with the siblings when they are teasing each other, you want to give them good advices and most importantly, you think about what you would have done in their situation.So I can really recommend watching this movie because of the good balance of comical and tragically effects, the great actors and not to forget, the fantastic story written by a man who collected his first experiences by creating this script which was such a success.

I was somewhat dubious about the way EAST IS EAST was touted as a comedy, seemingly about horny teenagers and adolescent rebellion against parental authority. I thought, Oh Lord, the Americans have a lock on this type of flick, and now the British want in, too.      Then, I saw Om Puri's name as the lead. I have been a longtime fan of this amazing actor, and thought, well it's worth a look.Wow! What a captivating, interesting and at times, humorous film. I found it unpretentious and unflinching, and marvelously human, which is where the humor rested. The mingling of cultures, and those becoming an amalgamation of the two, lead to uproarious clashes sometimes. The wishes, well in this case, the demands of the draconian father for his children, and the reality in which they live clearly head for confrontation. The screenplay by Ayub Khan-Din is a great slice of life; it's certainly wasn't hard to tell that he might have culled some of the notions included from life experience. It's not meant to be exacting, as some have criticized. No more so, than Laura Ingalls Wilder's LITTLE HOUSE ON THE PRAIRIE was meant to be a strictly historical factoid on pioneering life in the early western US. It's meant as a slice of it, of one persons vision or interpretation.EAST IS EAST is extraordinary, a marvel to watch, and one that simply gets better with each viewing. Don't miss this one.

Very much a period piece, the movie is set in Salford in 1971 - a telling time for a part-Pakistani family with Enoch Powell's shadow never too far away and the break-away of East Pakistan (Bangladesh-to-be)unravelling as the film goes on.  The poverty of 1971 Salford with the outside toilet, bedpans and tin bath is excellently portrayed.  And at a more mundane level, the constant sight of a bright orange space-hopper and its comedic demise is truly nostalgic, especially to this reviewer whose own space-hopper suffered a similar fate around 1971.  Superb acting performances all round - Linda Bassett used to be one of the better-kept secrets on the UK stage, but now I suppose the secret is out.  Highly recommended movie.

A hit in the UK upon release the film also did modest business in the US helped by a marketing campaign that promoted it as a breezy comedy but the film also tackles the serious question of what it was, and what it is, to be young, Asian and British. It's curious, and perhaps a little disappointing, that despite the early seventies setting the film steadfastly refuses to tackle the broader issue of racism in any depth. At a time when Enoch Powell was extolling the virtues of repatriation and the nations favourite sitcom was 'From Death Us Do Part' (or possibly 'Love Thy Neighbour') the worst any character in East Is East has to contend with is a shifty look from a nightclub bouncer. Powell does have a brief cameo, as a poster on a window that the family's daughter Meenah (Archie Panjabi) smashes in a defiant demonstration of her footy skills. It's a nice moment, a teenage Asian girl kicking in Enoch's head with a soccer ball &#150; What would Alf Garnett say? Unfortunately we don't get to find out as the films only really abusive white character (Who bears a suspicious resemblance to Johnny Spate's 'lovable racist') only appears a couple of times to mutter something about 'Bloody Pakis' or 'Pickininies'. The conflict between Indians and Pakistanis is given a similar treatment, with George expressing his distaste for Those cow worshipping bastards and the contemporary conflict on the subcontinent being relayed on the family's radio. Again, however, this seems more to add colour and humour than for any other purpose. Perhaps O'Donnell felt that a deeper examination of these issues would detract from the theme of Asian/British identity and it's true that other British features have dealt with the subjects in greater detail. Having said that it might have been an idea to make a passing reference to the fact that racial prejudice, while not necessarily any more commonplace than today, was certainly seen as more acceptable. Of course, despite the considerable attention to period detail, 'East Is East' lays no claim to painstaking factual accuracy. There's a fairytale like quality to the film heightened by the Bollywood-style primary colours that frequently contrast with the drab Salford landscape. This viewer was reminded of Hettie MacDonald's council estate love story 'Beautiful Thing', like this based on a stage play with a script by the original author. Both of these films employ a subtle heightened sense of reality that suggests a half remembered childhood memory. One marvellous sequence set in a Bradford Asian flea pit (The 'Moti Mahal') sees the entire Khan clan sitting transfixed during the latest Bollywood epic. It's that rare occasion when the conflicts within the family can be forgotten in favour of a fleeting moment of escapism. And conflicts there are, because the real meat of the film concerns the alienation that exists between the rigidly traditionalist George and the other family members. Played, with a mix of bumbling comedy and genuine menace, by Omi Puri George is certain he knows what's best for his children, not to mention his wife. He wants the kids to learn Urdu but they refuse to study, his precious sons should marry into another Pakistani family of his choosing but they want to screw around with white girls and his wife refuses to show the respect that is demanded in a Muslim marriage. George, while not exactly an anachronism &#150; he gets plenty of understanding from the like minded down at the local Mosque &#150; is a man who cannot see that his children are not like him. Their only sense of the 'homeland' is through their father and the traditions he imposes upon them. It's not surprising then that they consider themselves unequivocally British. Upon arrival in Bradford one of the youngsters takes a look at the locals and shouts excitedly There's 'undreds of 'em! In a way it's a shame that the family is mixed race. Not enough is done with this to really justify it and how much more impact the conflict between George and Ella (Linda Bassett) would have been were she also Asian. The fact that the Khan children are half Caucasian also simplifies the question of British-Asian identity a little too needlessly. All of this might suggest a rather dry, even depressing film, but like the colourful feature playing at the Moti Mahal 'East Is East' never forgets it's primary function is to entertain. This is, after all, essentially a comedy and it's frequently very funny indeed. The humour ranges from extremely broad &#150; a scene involving the 'banished' sons new life as manager of a 'swinging' London Boutique and another involving a latex vagina could both have come from an 'Austin Powers' movie &#150; to the grimly dark. The best example of this might be youngest son Sajid's (Who lives permanently inside his Parka like a prototype for 'South Park's Kenny) trip to hospital for a circumcision. Towards the end of the film, in a moment mirroring this, he has the hood of his jacket unceremoniously ripped off and is finally exposed to the outside world, or as close to the outside world as George allows the family to get. Clearly Khan-Din's surrogate in the film (Himself a Salford boy who would have been ten in 1971) much of 'East Is East' is viewed through his eyes and from this perspective the film can be seen as something of a 'coming of age' tale. While not entirely successful 'East Is East' is still a welcome addition to the increasing ranks of British-based Asian cinema and television. Seemingly made with a broad audience in mind it, nevertheless, takes up some serious issues. It's just a shame the filmmakers weren't willing to stick their necks out just a little bit further.

And boy was I disappointed!I've very rarely found British comedy films exciting and &#145;East is East' is no exception. The last one I saw was Blue Juice and it was even worse than this. Why Britain continues to produce amazing actors and actresses (Anthony Hopkins, Sean Connery, Hugh Grant, Emma Thompson, Kate Winslet etc.) and fail to produce great filmmakers is beyond my comprehension.`East and East' could have very easily been an engaging sentimental drama about a Pakistani immigrant and his family trying to cope in a foreign culture. But instead it is an obscene and vulgar comedy that makes mockery of Pakistanis in particular and muslims in general. All the characters that belonged to Pakistan, be it George Khan, Mr. Shah or all those Pakis George meet in Bradford (or is it Bradistan?) were stupid, ill mannered and devoid of any common sense. If that was not enough, they all were cruelly ignorant to the feelings of their families.   Character of Om Puri (George Khan) is very uni-dimesional. He is, ignorant, cruel, violent and doesn't seem to give a damn about anyone of his family. Never once do we see him talking nicely to anyone of his seven kids. Minnah was the only daughter among six sons, that should have made at least her an apple of his eye, or like many other of their misconceptions about Islam and Pakistan, the filmmakers thought that all Pakisatnis think less of their daughters than their sons? Throughout the film we hear that he wants the good for his children and never once does he talks politely to them? And was he blind or something to marry his oh-so handsome sons with such ugly looking girls? What was the director's message? That if u grow up in a Pakistani environment like Mr. Shah's daughter's did, u turn up like that?One more thing, in the wedding sequence at the beginning of the film, we hear `Allah Ho' played in the background. It was my first experience of hearing a mystical song on a wedding! Even the most radical families of Pakistan tends to sing certain traditional wedding songs and George's family was from Punjab where they have probably thousands of songs for this particular occasion only. Lack of knowledge Mr. Director? Or was it your unfathomable British sense of humor? The only commendable thing about the film is acting. Everybody has given a decent performance and it is useless to elaborate on how great an actor Om Puri is! The accent, the language, the facial expression were simply superb. I wish if only it had been for a better film. `East is East' is disappointing in every sense and to know that it has been rated as one of the finest British comedies ever made only suggests the standard of the British cinema.

Set in the north of England in the 1970's it is the story of an mixed race Asian family living in a mainly white community.  However the film doesn't really tackle the conflict between the races but rather the conflict within the family itself - both the clash of the cultures between the white mother and Asian father, and the children resisting the traditional culture of their father.The film rises easily above TV sitcom/drama to be of film standard in every sense.  The director captures the size of the house and the community well.  The acting is good - especially Om Puri as the father.  The film builds the picture of an eastern family mixing with the western culture well - with comedy scenes used as well as more dramatic scenes used to show this.If you enjoy this style of domestic humour, you'll love this (especially the scenes where the family are all together - check out the youngest who is a very British indeed and reminds me of Kenny from South Park!).  But don't be fooled into thinking that this is a crude toilet-humour style comedy (like the marketing suggests) it is much more than that. Also if you have a father who wanted his children to be raised a specific way (not necessarily Asian) then you'll get much of the drama between father and children.My only problem with this is that the characters sometimes seem to be caricatures, and the plotting is sometimes a bit ropey with so many things to fit in.Is it realistic of the experience of british Muslims at the time?

It's about a man--overly concerned with society's opinion of him--who struggles with an increasing feeling of impotence in a changing world. He could be any man in any society. The film could as easily be about a fundamentalist Christian father who fears his children's slipping away. To view this movie strictly in literal terms--to think it is about Muslims or Pakistanis--is to completely miss the point. That's simply the canvas for a larger theme.This father mistakenly places what society thinks of his family ahead of what the family itself wants. He's not evil--he's trying to do good--but errs in identifying what good is, and misses the signs that he's gone wrong.He has his youngest son circumcised at 8 years old. He hits his devoted wife, beats the one son who takes his side, and promises his two middle sons to ugly cows whose snobby mother sits in his house and insults his wife and children--all in the name of doing what's right for his family.His wife tells the awful prospective mother-in-law my sons are too good for your daughters because it's TRUE. Her husband has his head so far up his butt that rather than be embarrassed in front of his peers he takes for his sons the girls no other father would. His son Tariq is the catch of the town-- gorgeous women are literally fighting over him--and his father signs him up at a moment's glance to the ugliest girl in England.This after his first son ran out on an arranged marriage.Please don't tell me I'm horrible for judging the girls by their looks.

Yet it shows no respect for it's subject matter, casting the father of a mixed-race family, George Khan (Om Puri, excellent) as a vicious, foul-mouthed wife beater. This also causes a severe narrative conflict, where the warm-hearted George undergoes a complete character change halfway through the film.George is married to the English, white, Ella, yet we are asked to believe that he is a traditionalist and still upholds his religion. While many have slated the stereotypical portrayal of George, who is at first extremely humorous, later extremely violent, what is not often brought into question is the attitude of the children. As anti a representation as the father, they rally against circumcision and arranged marriage while drinking, dating white girls and eating bacon. It is this extreme characterisation that seems determined to cause offence.In technical terms, the film cannot be faulted. It is adequately directed, and the script by Ayub Khan-Din from his own stage play is full of witty lines. Acting is what truly saves it, though, with strong performances in particular from Tariq (Jimi Mistry) and Saleem (Chris Bisson). And, of course, Jordan Routledge as Sajid gets most of the best lines. But the film does not suggest any easy solutions. George's ideology (who's frequent use of the Urdu for sisterf***** is tellingly not subtitled) is discarded out of hand. There is no display of how his traditional values could be accepted by his family. So too, there is no suggestion that the two values could be combined, or that a compromise is available. Instead, what the film seems to promote is that the values George holds dear as wrong and that the western way of life is the only correct way for society. Political correctness, for all its goodness, saves this film. Negative reviews are virtually unheard in England where no one would criticise a minority work. And the fact that the production is written by an Asian rescues it from the racist tag. However, making a film that openly lambastes a culture and a belief is not a positive statement. There is, thankfully, an ever-increasing market for Asian culture in modern British society, and the country looks forward to the first successful British-Asian film. East is East, unfortunately, isn't it.

Nothing goes right in this family, from the sibling relationships, to intrafamily communication, to religious education, to anger management... Not to say that some of these issues don't exist in some Pakistani families living in Britain, but the fact that this is a rare glimpse into this population, the viewer can be easily misled into thinking that these backwards-ass families are the norm. Also, it is transparent that the screenwriter has a bone to pick with a character like the father in this movie, because the father is portrayed as one-dimensional, and hypernegativestereotypical in every way (manipulative, self-centered, violent, grammatically challenged, vulgar, and overall not too savory) and it portrayed almost comically.There is so much positive, vibrant, and beautiful in the Pakistani culture, and I'm not just talking about the clothing, as it was portrayed here. Most families are much stronger than what they have become in Western society. I wish this film would have had included some of these aspects and not so much ugliness passed off as slapstick.

Perhaps blinders prevented me from really seeing East is East, which I saw tonight at a local Indian film festival, for what it is.The movie reminded me of films like Sammy and Rosie (with Pakistani father played by Shashi Kapoor returning to visit family in London) and My Beautiful Laundrette (set in 1980s London) that I saw around 1985 or 1986.  Like those films, East is East deals with the lower middle class South Asian immigrant experience in London.  I didn't enjoy those films either, though My Beautiful Laundrette was worth seeing.George Khan (Om Puri), a traditional Muslim Pakistani, leaves his wife and homeland in 1937 to settle in England.  Sometime after that, he takes a second wife, Ella (played by Linda Bassett).  The film is set in the 1970s, and portrays George and Ella raising a number of sons and one daughter.  George tries to hang on to mores he was brought up with, and is insistent that the family follow these ways, accept his sole authority, and not adapt to the culture they are in.George claims to only try to do what he thinks is best for the family, but the lack of two-way communication and his authoritarian style deepen his cultural gap with the rest of the family.  His inflexible old-world traditions are especially problematic in that Ella is British and the children were all born and brought up in England, and this leads to a family crisis.I'm not sure what others saw in this film.  George's domestic violence was difficult to stomach, as were his constant profane tirades and closed-minded tantrums.  There were glimmerings of discrimination, and I feel the film could have been much more multi-dimensional and socially telling if it had explored this context.  I would also have found the story more compelling if it had hilighted some of the elements of Pakistani culture in a more positive light, and set the scene for more sympathetic consideration of the struggling immigrant father. Chalk it up to my idiosyncracies, but I would only give East is East a rating of 4 on a scale of 10. "},{"Title":"Never the Twain Shall Meet","Date":"13 February 2014","Score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Drama","Review":" East Is East can be seen as a return to the tradition of kitchen sink realism, which was responsible for so many fine British films in the fifties and sixties. It has a number of similarities with one of the last of those films, Spring and Port Wine. Both films are set in industrial towns in Lancashire (Salford here, Bolton in the earlier film). Both are set in the same period, the late sixties/early seventies. And both are centred upon a strict, autocratic father who finds his authority being challenged by rebellious children. There are, however, two major differences. One is that the action of Spring and Port Wine took place around the time it was made, whereas East Is East is a period piece, made in 1999 but set in 1971. It relies heavily on nostalgic period detail, featuring the fashions, pop music (The Hollies), television (The Clangers) and even toys (spacehoppers) of the era, although there are a couple of errors. Enoch Powell, for example, is seen on television referring to Alec Douglas-Home as Conservative Party leader (he resigned from that office in 1965) and there is a reference to the half-crown, a pre-decimal coin which ceased to be legal tender after 1969. The other major difference is that East is East revolves around the question of race, something that was quite absent in Spring and Port Wine. The father in this case is Zahir George Khan, the Pakistani Muslim owner of a fish-and-chip shop, who has lived in England since 1937. He is married to Ella, a white British woman, and they have seven children, six sons and a daughter. (There may, in fact, be some doubt about the legitimacy of their marriage under English law; we learn that he has a first wife still living in Pakistan, from whom he has never been formally divorced). The film starts with the oldest son Nazir refusing to go through with an arranged marriage, leading Zahir to disown him. (We later learn that Nazir is in fact gay). With the exception of Maneer, who is a devout Muslim, the remaining children, who were born and grew up in Britain, see themselves as British rather than Pakistani, and resent their father's insistence that they should follow Pakistani customs of dress, food and religion. Some of them, for example, go so far as to drink alcohol and eat pork, but always behind their father's back. It should be noted that Zahir does not always follow his own precepts; he is generally known as George, but has given all his children Muslim names and his sons Abdul and Tariq have to hide from their father the fact that among their English friends they are generally known as Arthur and Tony. (Nazir goes by the name Nigel). Similarly, although George has himself married a white woman he would be horrified to know that Tariq has a white girlfriend. There have been a number of other recent comedies about the Asian immigrant communities in Britain and their relations with the indigenous British community- Anita and Me and Bend It like Beckham are two other examples which come to mind- but East Is East, based on a play by Ayub Khan-Din, himself of Asian ancestry, takes a harder, more critical, look at Asian culture, especially at practices such as arranged marriages. Rafe Crompton, the central character of Spring and Port Wine had, for all his strictness as a father, a basic decency and kindness which enabled the Crompton family to stick together when threatened by crisis. George, by contrast, is an overbearing domestic tyrant who bullies his children and beats his wife when she tries to stand up for them. He even assaults the normally loyal and obedient Maneer. He resents the racist attitudes of his English neighbours, but displays similar prejudices himself, against Hindus (cow-worshipping bastards!) and even against his fellow-Muslims from East Pakistan, as Bangladesh was then known. (Bengali baboons!) Imagine the furore which would have been unleashed had epithets like these been uttered by a white character. At times he resembles not Rafe Crompton but an Asian version of Alf Garnett, the monstrous anti-hero of Till Death Us Do Part. Ayub Khan-Din took his title from a poem by Kipling, East is East and West is West, and never the twain shall meet. Kipling's theme was the differences between Eastern and Western culture, so the title is appropriate to a film on the same theme, although since Kipling write these lines East and West have indeed met in all sorts of ways he never dreamed of. In the context of the film, in fact, the implication is that when East and West do meet there should be some two-way cultural exchange, a suggestion that it is in nobody's interests for immigrant communities to try and live in some sort of monocultural ghetto, rejecting Western influences, as George is trying to. East Is East is sometimes described as a comedy, and there are certainly a number of amusing scenes, such as the ones in which George- who clearly has not learned his lesson following the debacle with Nazir- tries to arrange marriages for Abdul and Tariq to the two daughters of a Pakistani family from Leeds, despite the fact that the girls are fat and ugly, their father rude and arrogant and their mother a monstrous snob. If it is a comedy, however, it is a rather bleak and bitter one; George is a deeply unpleasant individual and we are left uncomfortably aware that attitudes like his could all too easily lead to tragedy. If we laugh at him, it is a very uneasy form of laughter indeed. 7/10 "}{"Title":"Astonishing!!!!","Date":"23 November 2012","Score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Drama","Review":" I just saw this incredible ensemble movie - I was most struck by the amazing ensemble acting by the entire cast, mostly unknown to me (Archie Panjabi is an emmy winner for her role on The Good Wife, and I have seen Linda Bassett in a few movies). I absolutely hated the father - he reminded me of my late father, who was also a bully who was enraged by his lack of ability to control others completely - Om Puri gives a ferocious performance - I would be curious to know what the actor felt about his part, did he see him (as I do) as a villain or did he see him as right? I found Linda Bassett's role a bit infuriating those women who stay with their abusive disgusting husbands no matter what. I loved how rebellious the kids were, yet they stayed stuck under this tyrant's thumb. But they could escape into British culture, the neighborhood, school, music, culture that was not Pakistani. The gay son was certainly stereotypical but I still found it daring - it's rare to see a happy gay couple (who also appear to be married) in movies from before 2000. Meena's dance is wonderful and fun. Damien O'Donnell's direction makes me wish he could make more movies (I've also loved Rory O'Shea Was Here, which was originally titled Inside I'm Dancing, but his other few films don't seem to have made it over here) - his direction is incredibly self-assured and brilliant, it was his feature film debut (he had made short films and commercials previously). I especially loved the feel of the film, the production design, the street - interestingly, it was filmed at Ealing Studios, 40 years after the last of the Ealing films were produced there.

As the most-of-the-time pliant, sometimes witty, but complete sympathetic mother, Bassett has her gut to fight back for her children, and her performance does has an effect of sublimating the heightened tension and brings about some excellent empathy which sharply differs from a general comedic tonality. All seven progeny and a handful supporting roles are molded with distinctive personalities (with many laughable episodes to entertain the viewers). So, about the aforementioned preach-the-converted argument, the film can be a tint offensive to portray Pakistani people in a quasi-teasing milieu (the two Pakistani maidens are rather wickedly selected), it seems the film is assuming the audience should already taken their stand (against the abominably bigoted father figure), clearly the truth is this fictional approach opts for its own British slant towards the Muslim immigrants, it may find its voice in the island, but elsewhere, its acceptance inevitably needs to be tested under the surface of its light-hearted masquerade.

A lot of people I know are always telling me that this film is really good and a great comedy. Well, even though I don't 'get' a lot of comedies, I thought I'd take a look, and I must say, although it has some amusing moments and some very funny dialogue, it's not really a comedy. I will tell you why after this brief summary.Set in Salford, Manchester in the early 1970's, this film tells the story of chip shop owner George Kahn, his wife Ella and their children. There are six sons and one daughter, oh, and I should point out that Ella is white and from Manchester. George wants to bring the kids up in the traditional Pakistani manner. Unfortunately for him, they don't particularly want to be brought up like that. He is insistent though, and goes ahead arranging marriages for his sons without telling them until the very last minute. We get a look into how the youngsters are just typical teenagers/young adults, who just want to be able to have a good time with their friends. The relationships between the various family members are also looked at quite closely, particularly Ella's relationship with George. I really don't want to go into too much detail as I'm very wary of giving too much of the plot away (Them Spoiler Police are very strict these days!).A very well made British film with some nice insights into a very interesting, and diverse family. The highlight for me was the performances of the main characters, both Om Puri as George Kahn and Linda Bassett as Ella Kahn were excellent. All the kids were very good; Jordan Routledge as Sajid, Archie Panjabi as Meenah, Emil Marwa as Maneer, Chris Bisson as Saleem, Jimi Mistry as Tariq, Raji James as Abdul and Ian Aspinall as Nazir.For me, I thought this film worked much better as a drama; this aspect of the plot brought out the best performances and was much more interesting. I did feel that a lot of opportunities went begging, but I could see that the filmmakers were very wary of causing offence. It was almost like they wanted to make a full-blown comedy, but the, more interesting, story about relationships and family life got in the way. I should mention that there are scenes of domestic violence that some may find distasteful. Having said that, I did quite enjoy this film and I think so long as you're not expecting a raucous comedy, it's one I can deem&#x85; Recommended.My Score 6.6/10.IMDb Score 6.7/10 (based on 9,232 votes at the time of going to press).Rotten Tomatoes Score 81/100 (based on 31 reviews counted at the time of going to press).

The film won the 1999 BAFTA for Best British Film and began life as a play at London's Royal Court two years earlier. It's a comedy drama set in Salford in the very grim North of England 1971. And if you're in a working class Anglo-Pakistani household it's doubly so. The Khans live in a back-to-back terrace house with an outdoor toilet (the production design here is terrific, it really does make the past a foreign country)and run the family chip shop.The film recalls another English movie from 1969 called 'Spring and Port Wine' - the northern working class family, the children wanting to break away from the grip of a tyrannical father. The father is George, played splendidly by Om Puri, the Pakistani father of a family who he doesn't realise are English they're sausage and bacon eating English, with sons who booze and go to discos and one of whom has a white girlfriend and responds to the prospect of an arranged marriage with I'm not marrying a f**king Paki.The whole cast is excellent - especially Archie Punjabi and Jimi Mistry - with Linda Bassett quite outstanding as Ella, George's English wife. She looks as if she's had 7 children. She's beaten up by George at one point, but remains devoted to her family throughout. She's a gem.

Yes, there are times when I laughed out loud but I chose this film because I was in the mood for a comedy. Had I been in the mood for a drama I am sure I would have scored the film much higher.East is East is the story of a Pakistani father, George Khan, his Caucasian British wife, Ella, and their seven children. The acting is superb, the writing is excellent, and the soundtrack is wonderful. Having said all of that, I do have a few issues with the film. (SPOILER ALERT) First, the oldest son, Nazir, just kind of disappears for a while without any explanation. Did he run away? Did he kill himself? Where did he go? We find out about halfway through the film when his father pronounces that he is dead. This leaves the viewer wondering how one could have missed such an important event, but a few minutes later we realize that Nazir is only dead to him. In fact, we discover, albeit something I guessed in the first ten minutes of the film, that Nazir is gay. This is all the more reason for his Pakistani father to call him dead.My second issue with the film is that I really liked all of the characters, even the strict and traditional George. Ella is charming the way she can talk him down from almost any argument with typical British humor mixed with a few choice swear words. The kids adore their mother and, although they disagree with him, they love their father. This led me to believe that the film was going to be a Dad is a strict traditional man, kids and mom are not, so this is the story of how everyone changes Dad. (SPOILER ALERT) Unfortunately, the story became, Dad is an abusive and closed-minded bastard and starts beating on anyone, including mom, who dares to defy him. I just don't understand why the story had to change this way. I left the film wishing Ella would leave her bastard husband and raise her kids on her own. We went from the tenderness of how Ella would ask George if he would like some tea and he would reply, just half a cup, to George calling her a bloody b**** and giving her a black eye. Why? My final issue with the film is the ending. (SPOILER ALERT) We are left with nothing changed in the family other than the children discovering that their father isn't just strict, he is cruel. I just feel incomplete after watching East is East. I get that the Pakistani culture is very different from British culture and that, particularly in the 1970's, the west was not very open to accepting this new group of immigrants. What else came of this story? I don't feel warm and fuzzy toward this culture if George is a shining of example of how the men truly behave. Why did he choose to marry outside of his own culture if he hates it so much? Why raise children with a mother who is not Muslim and not from Pakistan if you are just going to teach them that it is unacceptable to marry anyone who is not from Pakistan? I feel like I got a glimpse of a very dysfunctional family who will never see a happy ending and that is just not why I choose to watch films. I watch films to learn something new, or to laugh, to perhaps cry a little, but overall, I watch films to have a few hours of enjoyment. I watch films to forget my own problems for a while. After watching this, I just feel like I would have been better off calling my own family back home and hearing about their issues and problems.

I think it has done well, as the plot is funny and thought provoking, thought being offensive. The characters are realistic and engaging, all the seven children have their own unique personality. The relationship between the siblings and the parents are portrayed well. For example, the other siblings are jealous of Maneer as he is the father's favourite child. I was impressed that I managed to recognise and remember the names of all the seven kids! The controlling and authoritarian rule of the father is thought provoking. Given the society and cultural values are rapidly shifting, people who do not change with the times bring misery to themselves and others around them. When the father threatens Tariq at knife point, I thought I would already have gone to the police and the social services if I were them. The fact that Ella and the children tolerate this oppressive regime and domestic violence mirrors many real cases out there right now. It is sad.Despite the very heavy and sensitive subject matter, East Is East contains many hilarious moments. The best one for me is that the family pretends to be very British during the Shah family visit. When Meenah answered Righty ho in Queen's English, I laughed out loud! East Is East is a rare hybrid of entertainment and food for thought.

The situations in this movie are not so positive for the members of the Khan family, but with a little bit of British humour it becomes funny.

As well his brother Tariq is the rebel of the family, he fights against that, what his parents want him to do. Also Saleem another son, is a art student,what is against his fathers idea to become a Ingeneur. Maneer seems to be the only child of the seven, which stands behind his father. So it is shown, that nearly everybody of the Khan family isn't a perfect Parkistani.

The story is about George Kahn who is Pakistani and a very religious man, he has a British wife Ella, and they have 6 children together 5 boys and 1 girl. George wants his children to live under Muslim traditions and wants his children to be married in an arranged marriage with Pakistani girls. His oldest son Nazir did not want this, so he ran away in the middle of his wedding. After this his father don't want him in the family anymore, he's dead to him. And when Sahid and Meenah two of his sons, finds out that he has found two Pakistani girls to marry them, it's a start of a family conflict. Because the children don't want to be married away to some strangers, they feel like they are English, and they don't want to live under Muslim traditions, they want to live under the same conditions as normal English people do. But their father shows no mercy, he is strict, and expects everybody to follow his orders. The father has some inner demons that he keeps for himself, because he ran away from his wife in Pakistan and came to England and got married to an English woman. He probably feels that he has betrayed his culture and religion and he doesn't want his kids to do the same thing as him.The movie has a serious topic with a humorous undertone and the director manages to balance it very good so that the movie is fun and easy to watch.The characters are good, the actors play very well, and the dialogues are fast and funny.

Best was the cinematic attention paid to the Khan and Shah families. The movie builds just to this one point nicely. As I suppose is the case with all abusive partners, there is a soft apologetic side. I'll have a half a cup of tea was a nice way for Mr Khan show that without showing weakness.

Furthermore, it brings a smile to my face when we see messages from hypocritical americans with claims such as 'the language is vulgar.' I have to say, this film is highly realistic in representing a working-class northern english town in the 70's. What made me chuckle was an american claiming the 'sound' is badly done because they can't understand the accents. They sardonically complain that England is 'another foreign country that speaks English.' Can anyone spot the connection between the words 'England' and 'English?' hmm.. sorry.. where did the language originate?

The story focusses on George Khan (brilliantly played by Om Puri), a twice-married Pakistani man who is desperately trying to find wives for his older sons. Meanwhile, his sons have other ideas...With such a great story to begin with, you would expect this to be entertaining, but East is East manages to be even more than that. Most of the time it is a highly entertaining comedy, using the tension between the old ways of the father and the new ways of the kids as a vehicle for all sorts of gags and great set pieces. (The scene in which they have to get rid of the evidence of bacon-eating in a hurry is a great example of this.) Of George's six sons, Tariq is the most spirited, climbing out of his bedroom window at night to head down to the local disco, where he pretends to be English and has a whale of a time flirting with all the local girls. His regular squeeze, sweet-natured Stella, comes from a family of Enoch Powell supporting racists, emphasising the tensions that accompanied being a Paki in 1970s England. Fortunately, the film does not labour the point, instead focussing on quite how normal and spirited the English-born Khan kids really are.The film turns a bit darker in the last 20 minutes, as father tries to assert his absolute authority over his (white) wife and all of his children -- but this is also handled well and does not make the film seem too heavy. In fact, the final scenes are really quite moving, because after a big confrontation, everyone is shocked that the order of things has been challenged so fundamentally. This points to the fact that both Pakistani and English cultures are quite stable and slow to change, revealing similarities which lie beneath the apparent differences of culture.East is East is not a particularly deep film but it's a great chunk of entertainment and is well worth seeing. If it never reaches the dizzying heights of The Buddha of Suburbia (of which it is very faintly reminiscent), it is because its primary aim is to entertain, which is manages very well indeed.

But they are radically different.  MSTF was ideologically driven, because Hanif Kureishi was trying hard to make a point, so his view of Islamic fundamentalism came off as forced and unreal.   East is East has no such ideological ax to grind.  It has a lot of compassion for the characters in this family and treats them as real human beings.  Om Puri's acting job in this one was brilliant, to take a character as brutal and blockheaded as this, and still infuse it with warmth and sympathy.  That must have been almost impossible, but he pulled it off.  The portrayal of plebian Muslim life was (in some respects) much more true to life, unlike in MSTF.  Another comment criticized the character praying in the morning after the sun had risen high in the sky.  Actually, it is not forbidden in Islam to pray when th sun is risen high, only when the sun is on the horizon.  The dawn prayer is supposed to be before sunrise, but if you oversleep, you make it up whenever you awake.  Since this film was set in the summer in North England, when the sun rises awfully early, it would be easy to oversleep.  So given this condition, the film was actually realistic.  In any comedy, they have to play up certain exaggerated characteristics.  But you don't have to be too thin-skinned about racism.  I didn't see the film as an attack on Pakistanis or Islam.  Om Puri's character said that in Islam, everyone is equal, no black or white.  That was true and well spoken.  But otherwise, he was ignorant that in Islamic law the parents cannot force the children to get married if they don't want to.  I thought it was more a comment on ignorant Muslims than an attack on Islam.  But non-Muslims seeing this may not realize that Islam is actually more liberal than Om Puri's character showed.  They will just have to investigate on their own, I guess, or Muslims like me could point it out.I see other commenters going on about the dog gags in the trailer.  Well, I didn't see the trailer, so I just went in with an open mind and had a great time!  The best line in the film was the one about half-breeds vs. inbreeding.  That hit home especially because there really is too much cousin marriage in India & Pakistan, not good for the gene pool.I also richly enjoyed the moment when Enoch Powell was smashed to smithereens, and the redheaded kid who kept saying salam `alaykum at the most inopportune moments was priceless!

His need to control his family and his inability to do so without becoming violent seemed very real and true-to-life.  I also found Ella, the mother, to be an intriguing character.  She seemed to understand and sympathize with George's problem, even though she still tried to protect her children.  Tariq, as the rebellious, older boy, seemed to be an English version of his father.  The scene where he confronted his father about George's hypocrisy was wonderful. Also, while George tried to make his children behave more like Pakistanis, the world outside their home, because of the prejudice against Pakistan, influenced them to become more English.  The acting in this film was superb. While the transition between comedy and tragedy was often sloppy, the film showed that both comedy and tragedy do exist in the world.  While the scenes where the children ran from their father during the parade and where the children hid the bacon were funny, the scene where Tariq ripped up his wedding clothes and his father beat his father was tragic.  All of these scenes dealt with the same issue, even though it was handled differently. The violence and the bawdy humor may discourage some filmgoers, but this film is worth seeing.

There is no emphasis on the bright or dark sides of family life, they both offset and complement each other.

Granted George Khan was the archetypical cruel father who came to England with no baggage but was proud that he had his own business. But the cultural baggage from Pakistan is what he cannot unload . His children all handsome and lovable have taken to calling their cross-cultural cousins the derisive term Pakis. The English mother is played brilliantly by Linda Bassett who has the right mix of resignation to George's explosive temper tantrums and raising a family. This is 1971, in Salford, teeming with Indians and Pakistani immigrants, bringing in their curries, habits and marrying their kind. This is also the welfare-state England before Maggie Thatcher and when Enoch Powell held full sway. So the barriers are high. What is poor George to do? He makes the impulsive decision to marry an English girl in 1946 knowing that his culture will never accept his wife or ever fully tolerate mixed-heritage children. But he single-handedly wants his kids, all seven of them, to follow the Pakistani way. Being unsuccessful with his first son in an arranged marriage and almost ready to strike out with No. 2 and No. 3 arranged marriages, you could see the Pakistan George built in Salford slowly disintegrating. And in a gripping scene with his son Tarik who has the courage to tell his father his own feelings, George menacingly challenges him to go against his wishes and face the consequences. But they capitulate only at the urging of the mother. The scene when the two brothers meet the absurdly ugly brides-to-be and the supercilious future mother-in-law questions the Khans ability to house them in the cramped quarters must surely be familiar to many South Asians who may have at least seen Bollywood movies with the same theme, or even worse, heard of or experienced their own experiences.But this is 2000. The world is a global village  with 747s depositing cultural baggages at heady rates. CNN and the Internet have bridged these divides. The immigrants coming from South Asia hit the ground running and achieve all sorts of capitalistic success. But the movie tells us that beneath a thin veneer of tolerance and acceptance there may be powerful xenophobic forces that cause a George Khan to retreat back into his own cultural comfort zone.

Set in 1971, East is East provided an insight into the Khan family of Manchester, England. Father George, played by Om Puri, was a Pakistani immigrant who believed that the traditions of his homeland were of utmost importance to raising his seven children.  However, as the second generation, they didn't see it that way.  East is East used comedy in several scenes to illustrate a serious message, and the conflicts between George and his children included circumcision, Islamic dietary laws, and interdating.  Ironically, what most angered George in his children was something of which he, himself, was guilty.  This movie is worth watching.

The first half is really a lot of broad comedy about ethnic divides that people can relate to wherever there is a multi-cultural community and kids feel separated from their parents by differing views about the importance of ethnic traditions.  Some of the comedy was very funny I thought.  However the second half is quite heavy going.  The Pakistani father tries with terrible results to arrange marriages for two of his sons.  I think that the drama was well done, but it seemed as though the makers of the film couldn't decide whether this film was to be a comedy or drama.  Now I'm not saying that a film can't be both, but the change in tone between the two parts of this film, is quite large.  However, I must say that there are a lot of good things in the film.  Om Puri and Linda Bassett are both terrific and the humor in and of itself is funny.  Touching the issue of domestic abuse is certainly admirable, but to me, the change of tone from broad comedy to dark drama was too jarring for the film to retain its effect.

It turned out that the critics were just reacting to seeing a British movie that wasn't total toilet - remarkable enough in itself, but still no cause for great celebration.It would be churlish to attack the intentions behind this film, of course - to show racism and domestic violence as both aberrant and abhorrent can only be a good thing. But the film would have got these points across better were it a straight drama, instead of which we are treated to rather forced 'comic' scenes juxtaposed distastefully with tension and violence. It also would have worked better as more of a two-hander between Om Puri and Linda Bassett's characters, rather than needlessly beefing up the roles of the children (none of whom was actually established as a believable character anyway, with the exception of the youngest son Sajid).There was simply too much tokenism and stereotyping - gay son runs away from arranged marriage; white neighbour hates 'Pakis'; son's girlfriend has 'comedy' overweight friend - to allow the film to be taken seriously. Try watching it again, though, or just thinking about it again, not in terms of race -  because it's not actually a film about race. It's about family, masculinity, values, tradition, morals - almost everything BUT race. All viewers  need to get past the novel concept of seeing brown faces in a film and they'll discover an interesting, honest film, albeit one that ultimately tries too hard.

So its fair to say I was looking forward to seeing it, afterwards I felt let down.The film is set in seventies Manchester, and centres around a mixed race Pakistani-English family. The main theme of the film is about do the children feel English or Pakistani and will they go through with their fathers wishes and agree to an arranged marriage.As mentioned, this is rather sensitive subject matter, but the films director seems to have been dettered by this and only just really scratched the surface of the issue. The father is a typical stereotype, possibly done for comic effect to a certain degree. But his wife and children are not in alligence with him, and hence the plot devlops, rather slowly and painfully.The film is not without its bright moments, and you do laugh once in a while but not for any great length of time. If you watch the trailer, you've seen all the jokes.There are possibly eight characters the film that we are expected to centre our concerns around. This doesn't work though because no real time is speant on each of them and you don't know or in some cases care what they want out of life etc. No real time is speant exploring the reasons behind why the characters either want to be involved in the marriages (religous beliefs etc.)or why they don't (feeling as though they are English etc.).Due to these factors you can't really gain a full picture of the circumstances in which the film is set. You end up feeling depressed and sorry for the family because of the way they are, not because of the struggle that they face, which should really of been the goal of the film.This film had so much going for it and a load of potential that it just hasn't realised. Better luck next time. More bottle required.

The funny scenes are very very funny, the sad scenes are devastating, but both these parameters are controlled by the excellent ensemble cast. The script was not nearly as good as I had expected, with many stagnant points in the film that made me wonder if I was perhaps missing the point! If I was then I apologise, but for me this film did nothing but demonstrate how good some of these complete unknown actors can be.

As it turned out, East is East was rather engaging, often humorous and had some truths about the immigrant's experience although it wasn't especially profound. In the last act, I was dismayed when the domestic violence aspect was introduced and from there the movie began to disappoint. The issue of domestic violence was no more relevant to this situation as it is to any other and nothing in the disposition of Puri's character to that point indicated that he would cross the line and nothing in his wife's disposition suggested that she would stand for it. The imposition of a person's will on their children or spouse in such situations is usually through guilt and manipulation and the film would have been more interesting and intelligent had it stayed in that realm. Even when the domestic violence occurs, the film doesn't commit to exploring the issue to the extent deserved and begins to inject a variety of comic relief instead. To be honest, I didn't even realize that it was set in 1971. I thought the disco, clothing, hair and whatnot were part of some comedic retro styling. Certainly the xenophobia is largely as true now as it was then.

It's especially true for the new Brit offering East is East, which just won major kudos at the BAFTAS over the weekend.The trailer for this film made it out to be a raunchy comedy, complete with animal sex jokes and urinal humor.  Not that there's anything wrong with that, but the movie is way more than that.  This is essentially the story of a family, and a journey that it takes.  It delves into areas such as family loyalty and honor with skill and depth, and brings out subtle shadings that keep it from merely stooping to play to the lowest common denominator of comedy.This flick has some superb direction and the acting is great, especially Om Puri, who added a human dimension to a character who could have been difficult to portray onscreen as anything more than a traditionalist domestic abuser.  In his turn as a traditional Pakistan father and man of the house, trying to keep his family together as they are seduced by English culture, he gets your sympathy by refusing to bow to any kind of stereotypes at all.George Khan, who also wrote the stage play of the same name, based a large part of it on his own experiences.  For this reason, the circumstances never seem forced or implausible.That said, as I remarked I do have some problems with the juxtaposition of the abuse and the comedy in the film.  This tension filled scene is put between two scenes of hilarious comedy, and while it often happens in real life that extreme comedy comes from extreme tragedy, I felt the filmmakers did not give the audience enough time to breathe and recover from the harsh physical violence that was portrayed.  The father has some serious flaws that I felt were splendidly shown by Puri's acting skill, but were often glossed over in favor of advancement of the plot's comedic elements.

For my critical appraisal I'd just like to say that as a semi-lapsed Muslim woman myself I found this film excruciating.Most disturbing of all was the fact that the (largely white when I went to see it) audience's laughter came at some highly inopportune moments bordering on the racist eg at the children calling their father Paki or the jarring English of the aforementioned father.The story was quite frankly implausible (a marriage of two people with clearly nothing in common) and the film itself downright irresponsible (sending out unwanted signals of wife-beating merciless Pakistanis). Every Asian cliche  in the book was present from inbreeding to home office (via throwawy remarks) to the in-yer-face not at all subtle soi-disant Islamic discipline, arranged marriages etc.Such public forums portraying British Asians - until recently an invisible community in popular culture - are rare.

The question is not resolved, although one would like to think that the father reflects on his despotic nature and allows his children their freedom to live a life in the style of the country in which they and their mother were born, and that he may come to terms with the fact that life in England cannot be lived in the same way as life in Pakistan.

I kept watching it nevertheless and I must say that I'm glad that I did, because this movie sure is worth a watch, but it didn't really fulfill the expectations that I had in advance.When in the early 1970's, a traditional Pakistani father - who lives in England with his English wife and his kids - sees how his offspring more and more starts to behave as British and start to reject their father's rules on dress, food, religion,... he decides that it is time for them to get married to a good Pakistani girl. But their desire for independence and a modern way of live clashes with the traditional believes of their father and it doesn't take long before a lot of things start to go terribly wrong. And when the potential candidates aren't exactly the prettiest of all women, they know for sure that they will have to do anything to prevent getting married...If you are looking for a light-footed comedy, than this movie is one big disappointment. Sure, there are some funny moments to be found in this movie, but overall I certainly wouldn't call it a comedy. In my opinion this is a drama that shows how the traditional values of immigrants don't always fit in with those of the native inhabitants and that their children often are the victim of that. They no longer seem / want to belong to their own ethnic group, but are still seen as foreigners by the traditional inhabitants. They have to fight against prejudices from both sides and that's not always easy. In my opinion the movie really gives a good idea of what it's like and even though it's all situated in the seventies, all that much hasn't changed in thirty years time.The acting in this movie is really good. Although I can't immediately say that I know anyone of them, the actors in this movie make it all feel very authentic without overdoing it all. It's all too easy to make stereotypes out of the different characters, but that certainly isn't the case in this movie. Just as unknown as the actors are the director and the writer of this movie.

I think the writer effectively uses the English white wife as a ploy to test the viewers approach to the patriarchal strict father. What I don't understand is, how does a man, who married an English white wife have strict rules for his children? Especially during a tough conflicting period in Britain for Asians.It has numerous flaws stemming from this and so the reality is ultimately flawed here and it is greatly flawed by the fact they try to bring it across as a reality.I would also add Asian's (from Indian sub-continent) will enjoy this because they can create a false image of the non-existent strict parent they hear about in society. He doesn't exist. It's just a story people use as an opposite to the free-liberal and hedonistic view their parents have of the west.It's an illusion.So you'll basically find people watching this from all persuasions seeking a realistic example of an urban myth.Is it enjoyable? I will state it is enjoyable if you love your films dramatic and to appear realistic. It is neither and at times I couldn't believe how the director attempted to present this or in what state of mind the writer wrote it.All families are dysfunctional in some way these days and this is another film trying to play on the urban myth in the uk of a strict parenting from a dysfunctional family. There are more Children who run away from their families in western families in the UK than from Asian origin by ratio. Grotesquely flawed is this film that you could probably realise it does appeal to people who love dramatic films hoping for that realistic feel and getting lost in the illusion of film making.Yes - Awful.The Comedy.It's funny if you like slapstick badly presented. I know there is a market for this with the jackass shows and amateur stuntmen programming or even the home video shows. That's about the comedy throughout the film - laughing at the expense of someone else doing something you'll probably never ever see in real life; probably because it doesn't exist.This is where it begins to border racism as well. Presenting a group of people inaccurately so people can laugh at them (of Asian and non-Asian origin) in the belief the dramatic sense of the film makes it real, it's not them and they can sleep easier.Awful film. Avoid at all costs. Watch Donnie Darko, The girl with a pearl earring, Shawshank redemption, a beautiful mind, road to perdition... instead. My point is - lot's of great films out there - avoid this 90 minutes of your life at all costs.

It seems to feed into and confirm the negative stereotypes on Muslims living in abusive, patriarchal, sexist, oppressive families and children who dream and worship the western culture. Although it may have occurred in Ayub's family there are thousands of Muslim families in which this does not happen. A lot of Muslims who leave Muslim countries are proud of their background and live 'normal' lives just like western people.Domestic violence and sexism are universal problems, that occur all around the world and not just in the Muslim community. I also got the impression that the message of this film is that western culture is better than the Muslim religion and the phrase 'when you are in Rome do as the Romans do' arises, which I totally disagree with. The 'comedic' moments in the film were mostly dirty and rude jokes which was what further made this film really bad. If Ayub Khan Din wants to make good British Asian films, he should look to impressive examples such as 'Bhaji on the Beach'. That was a balanced film that gave out the message that all ethnic groups are similar, in that some people are good and some are racist and prejudiced.

It is set in 1971 when Din would've been about 10 - the youngest child Sajid is representative of him at that time.The film attempts to tackle a serious issue with some humour which, for me, worked well though others may be offended by the light-hearted take on the issues within the film.The culture clash is hilarious, providing a great take on multiple identities, and any kind of opression. The lengths that the children go to to enjoy British culture mixes great comic set pieces, whilst showing the difficulties encountered in mixed race families at the time. The concept of arranged marriages seems alien and despotic to the British-Pakistani children, but to their father George, (Om Puri), it is a part of his culture, a culture that he thinks should be adopted by his children too. Note George's hypocrisy - he is bigamously married to a white woman, leaving his Pakistani wife in Pakistan.The racist grandad across the street, who campaigns for anti-immigration politician, Enoch Powell, shows the kinds of attitudes that such a family would've had to face every day.Please don't call this film racist. Ayub Khan-Din grew up in Salford at this time, in a this kind of environment, so is basing this film on FACT with a comic spin. If you dislike the movie, fine, but don't accuse it of being something it isn't.For the hilarious script, great characters, and suprisingly skillful direction this film stands out from the crowd.

The story is quite interesting, but leaves a lot to be desired. I don't see why this had to be a comedy. If they made a drama out of this, it would have been much better. Some of the elements were downright tragic, such as the wife beating scene and the poor youngest child who had to hide behind his hood. These things were acted out well and gave food for thought, but the overall quality of the movie was uneven. Nothing wrong with the acting here, the mother and the father were good characters, as well as some of the children. Tariq, the youngest boy whose name I forgot and the boy who hanged out with him were well made. The oldest son, the girl and the other boys had less depth and left me thinking the writers didn't know what to do with them. Tariq's girlfriend and her fat best friend were stereotypical and boring characters, as well as the other family who wanted to give their daughters to marriage.The humor seemed terribly forced. Some of the scenes were funny, but none left me roaring with laughter. Most of the humor was just old and uninspired. How about coming up with your own jokes before making a comedy? There's been talk here about the profanity, and it didn't bother me, but profanity isn't enough to make a good joke. There's a double standard in the movie. The traditional culture's view of women is shown as sexist and bad, while the western-world beauty ideals are presented as good and natural. A fat girl clinging on a boy and following her best friend even on a date? Pleease. What about the ugly brides of the boys? The mother tells them you are not good enough for my boys - even though the girls did nothing but looked bad. Soo sexist. This might be funny for men, but as a woman, I was only offended to see this stuff. It's stereotypical and just simply not funny. The other stereotype is with gays. A young man doesn't want to get married - he's gay! Look, he's a hairdresser! Soo gay. Is that funny? NO. If humor has to rely on stereotypes, it shows lack of creativity. Make this movie again with more drama and less stupid humor. Make all the children characters in their own right and include more discussion on the cultural problems and domestic violence, and you've got a great movie.

Pakistani fathers think that Pakistan is the best country in the world, and how corrupt the west is. Arranged marriage wise you do have a lot of say as to how things go down. However in the movie the father was doing it because of what the community was thinking of him. And that is 100% true, in Pakistani culture what the community thinks of you carries massive importance to the point that people live very artificial lives as all they display is a fake realm If you expose any flaws about your family, you then get marked and set yourself up for gossip. The scene where they are at the middleman's (the guy who knew the family with the daughters) house and the kids were just zoned out and staring at the floor. Oh...that brings back many similar memories.Hybrids definitely live dual lives. One for each culture. People expect you to think and behave like them. Pakistanis want you to care about Pakistani culture, traditions, food, clothes, chain of command, urdu, etc&#133; And the same thing happened in white environments, for example that one dudes bachelor party with all the drinking. It's hard for purebreds to relate when someone sort-of like them doesn't think like one of them. Pakistanis think you're being rebellious. White people think you're antisocial. So your options are to live dual lives and just integrate to whatever people think you should be doing so you can be accepted, or not adopt anything and become isolated (eg that one religious son). Picking one side completely never works either, because you'll never be someone you're not. So as a hybrid you're totally playing this balancing game.

And arranged marriage is such a watered down process now days (at least in America) it merely resembles an anonying setup date.   Of course, this is not America and this is 70's england.  Even though other reviews tried to explain away that the father wanted to find an identity.  It's still quite ridiculous.  And is there any father in the world who wanted to find their handsome sons ugly wives?Another problem is that the film family just simply have too many sons, and it almost took whole length of the film to get to know everyone of them (the run-away, playboy, playboy-wannabe, artist, religous, kenny), forgive me I don't remember their names.  The middle two or three of them have little contrast to provide different view of the father, instead they just add the confusion.  I'd think playboy-wannabe and artist son can be do away with, and religous son could have more lines.Why was the daughter charater needed?  She doesn't participat in any emotional conflict,  rather, she is merely a lesser version of playboy son.

I think the first thing that got to me was the very unnecessary gag very early in the film... very literally toilet humor. Anyone who's seen it will know what I'm referring to. A similar gag occurs several more times in the film. The question the viewer immediately poses is, quite simply, why? It has no proper place in a drama about national identity. In general, the humor doesn't work well, and it at times even hurts the strength of the drama. The plot is fine, and it develops OK throughout the film. The pace is sufficient. What little of the humor does work, works really well. Personally, I found the male lead difficult to comprehend a lot of the time... had it not been for the subtitles(as us Danes are and have been used to for many decades), I would have had a hard time of following the plot. The film provides some perspective on the subject of immigration as well as that of mixing cultures. These people are neither entirely British nor Pakistani... the father desperately clings on to his Islamic heritage whilst the rest of the family find themselves preferring their surroundings, England. The choice of whether to adapt to your new environment, become assimilated... or to stubbornly resist. As bad as the father looks at times, as easy as it would be to hate George... his cause and motivation is impossible to ignore. He's afraid. He sees the bad that complete assimilation can do, and he has faith in the ways of his old country. His dominance over the house is a thing of frailty, and the slow but determined struggle to challenge it is a big part of what makes the film worth watching at all. The film presents an image of a Middle Eastern family living in a Western country... whether or not this image is accurate is arguable, as is how objective it is. My final thought... is George's frequent outburst at his kids, calling them bastards an ironic statement made by the director... or is it simply a sad testament to the fact that, at the end of the day, that is what he considers his own children to be? I recommend this to anyone interested in films dealing with what happens when dramatically different cultures meet, but be forewarned that the jokes rarely work and the overall film isn't as well done as it could be. I will say that anyone finding themselves watching much of the film, and not downright hating what they see, ought to watch it all the way to the end... a scene right by the end is funny, strong and empowering.

The film is a slice of life depiction of a multi-racial family at its crisis point, - the children are entering into adulthood.  The parents who have been able to straddle both worlds up until this time are pitted against each other in terms of which world they want the children to become part of.  But much like life, it is not a simple story of culture clash. The father wants them to be traditional Pakistani, even though he has been very happily married to an English woman for 25 years and not returned to see his traditional Pakistani First Wife during that time.The mother while verbally balking at much of what her husband says, supports him and demands the children respect him and encourages their embracing his culture.While the father is domineering, the wife is shown as being more than able to stand up to him and he as being all bark and little bite.

The struggle she in particular faces, with her love for her often brutal husband and respect for his culture clashing with her love and hopes for her children to experience a more liberal upbringing whilst respecting and not disappointing their father is the heart of this film.

Ask the British to do it and you would get East is East, a film that would be funny if it wasn't so deadly serious.  The irony is that in trying to portray a painful assimilation by an earnest Pakistani father to an English society (including his own unresolved acceptance of his mixed marriage), it has delivered the very anti-Islamic message it was trying to avoid.  The touching scene, in which the English mother and her six children crowd into a public phone booth in the rain to talk to the eldest son who has been cut off by the father from the family, symbolizes the movie's half-baked attempt at humor while setting its serious tone.  At the same time, attempts at religious satire such as the children eating pork while the father is away, scratching over the town sign of 'Bradford' to 'Bradistan', and presenting two would be wife candidates so unappealing they are referred to as Laurel and Hardy, only serve to give a terribly one-sided slant on Islamic culture.  Curiously, the only son who tries to mimic the fundamentalist nature of his father is strangely not demonstrative and even gets caught up in a tragic beating by his father. Added to this are some interesting conflicts which get tossed around without much thought - the neighbor campaigning against immigrants, another English mother who has lost her daughter to her domineering Pakistani husband, and side romances between two of the sons to odd English girls and one of the sons to another man. The real strength of this misshapen family would seem to be the mother, who carries the enormous task of placating the harsh and, at times, violent demands of her husband with the Western seeking and rebellious appetites of her children but the film botches up this role until the copped-out ending.  East is East wants to be a mainstream film serious about conflicts between two cultures but comic enough to be successful commercially, not an easy task for which this picture fails miserably.

In reply to all those who say that the film is not realistic, it actually comes from the play East is East, written by Ayub Khan-Din (as is the film) and it was mostly autobiographical (he is represented by Sajid).  His father was very much like George is in the film, and there is actually a very interesting discussion as an introduction to the screenplay in which Khan-Din in which he says that he wrestled with the representation of him (which is why there are elements of him trying to do the best for his family in the film).  I recommend that people who feel the character is too shallow read this.  Again with complaints about the swearing - this is how working class Salford was (and still is in many parts) - to not include this would be to take away the gritty realism of the film that works so well.I am very disturbed by the comments saying that the filmmakers were irresponsible by not pointing out that not all Asian families are like the one portrayed in the film - it represents intrinsic racism in which a 'white' or 'mainstream' film can represent specific interpretations of reality which we understand do not represent all of an entire section of our society but an 'Asian' film must represent ALL Asian people, as if they are so easily stereotyped.  We know that not all Scottish people are heroin addicts even though Trainspotting portrays some of them - please don't be so crass as to assume that this film can somehow tell us everything that there is to know about Anglo-Asians.  It just shows us a 'slice of life' of one specific family, and it does it extremely well in a way that we all have something to learn from it.  If people go away from this film thinking that all Asian people are like that then they are ignorant, and this is an intelligent, thinking film which would have been way out of their league.Not only does the film talk to us about race, but about growing up, about domestic violence, about the poor/rich divide, about ANYONE with multiple aspects of their identity, about the pressures to fulfil expectations, and something about the whole ethos and richness of Northern life in the 70s. Watch it for this, not as an 'Asian-by-numbers' film - if you go into it expecting something as shallow as that, that's not what you'll get and you will be disappointed.

Most of the comments I had read about it were very good, so that made me very interested.It is all about a mixed British/Pakistani family of which the father is a very believing Islamic person. Islamic culture states that the father is the head of the family and decides what happens even to the level of marriages of children. Islam can have arranged marriages, in which the children have no influence of their own. And of course Islam states that the father decides on the family affairs and everybody else has to obey.British culture in the seventies was of course very different. We had just had the sexual revolution or were still in the middle of it. People, if they married, married for love and not because the fathers arranged the marriage. Children learned to think for themselves to the point of rebelling against the parents if necessary.Those are the two scenes in this family. The children have grown up in British culture and adapted brilliantly to it (i.e. they like pork meat, disco, alcohol and wanting to make decide for themselves), but the father wants to put Islamic principles on his whole family when it comes to religion and arranged marriages. This of course creates major conflicts and that is how the movie starts. The oldest son walking out of an arranged marriage on the wedding day. In Islam this is a disgrace to the family and the father is ultimately responsible.In the end the conflict heats up so much that the father has no other option than to use violence against the only child that wants to live the life the father wants him to live and against his western wife, brilliantly portrayed by Linda Basset. However, although the violence is quite severe (black eyes, wounds etc), Ella in the end sticks to her husband and stands up for him against her own children. The end of the movie is a romantic open ending. The audience will have to decide.During the movie, I continuously had to be alert of what I was thinking. As a Western European person I was appalled with the way the father wanted to force his principles on his family, especially his sons (in Islam the sons are much more important to a father than the daughters), from the circumcision of the youngest to the violent reaction against the other sons when he had arranged their marriages and they did not like it and showed him very clearly. My thought Hay, we live in a free country... When thinking of my (very small) knowledge of Islam and Asian cultures, however, I could not help and sympathize with this father, who really wants the best for his children (the best according to his own cultural background) and gets to the point of despair when his children appear to think completely different (Western/British).The movie was a comedy, but one with a very serious underlying theme, the clash between two completely different cultures in one family.

So I wasn't really surprised when I saw East is East going the same route. In this age of political correctness, this film openly lambastes Pakistani culture and its beliefs.East is East could have been a very engaging, thought provoking sentimental drama about a Pakistani immigrant and his mixed race family struggling to cope with each other. But instead it is an offensive, obscene and crass comedy. The comedy has almost childishly been created at the expense of Pakistani values, which happen to be different than those of the film makers. It could even have been amusing, if this depiction were balanced, but unfortunately, this film just projects a one sided and highly biased viewpoint. All the Pakistani characters are portrayed as stupid, ignorant and devoid of any common sense.Om Puri plays (George Khan) a Pakistani immigrant living in Manchester in the early seventies. Although he acts superbly, his characterization is extremely one-dimensional. His very name, spells out the film makers' ignorance. No self respecting fundamentalist (as George is portrayed to be) would ever call himself George!!! He is portrayed as an ignorant, vicious, heartless and violent wife basher who has utterly no regard for any of his seven children. George is married to the white, English Ella, yet we are asked to believe that he is a traditionalist and wants to uphold his extreme religious beliefs.Not once is he shown expressing love and concern for his children. Instead, he is portrayed as a despot slave driver who is willing to whip up anybody who dares to confront him at the slightest provocation.  The most ridiculous premise is that we are actually asked to believe that his children who are all in their late teens to mid twenties,  (except Sajid) accept this reign of tyranny until the very last reel!!!The film would have been more intelligent if George Khan were shown as an intelligent manipulator. That at least would have been more convincing. The film makers sadly have numerous misconceptions about Islam and Pakistan and in their zest to pass it of as comedy, some totally unbelievable situations are injected such as the sequences involving watches with Arabic inscriptions. Moreover, only a blind father would be willing to marry his good-looking sons with hideous, unsightly girls in the name of culture and tradition. Perhaps the director implied that children raised in a Pakistani environment like Mr. Shah's daughters, turn out to be dull, dumb and grossly obese.The only commendable factor in this film is acting by a cast of virtual unknowns. Almost all actors have given decent performances with Om Puri once again establishing his prowess as an exceptional actor. Strong performances in particular from Ella (Linda Basset), Tariq (Jimi Mistry) and Saleem (Chris Bisson) help keep the film afloat. Jordan Routledge as the youngest son Sajid also deserves a special mention.The script by Ayub Khan-Din unfortunately, lacks authenticity and spells out extreme prejudice suggesting that any culture other than the western way of life is loathsome, silly and laughable! The fact that this film has been hailed as one of the finest British comedies ever made, only suggests the criterion of the British cinema.George's values are high voltage even by the standards of the most radical families in Pakistan. To accept that he wants these beliefs thrust upon his mixed blood family living in Manchester is nothing but an insult to the audience's intelligence.

What`s new in this film, is that the old Pakistani`s sons don`t want to marry the proposed brides not because they love other girls. They meet with some plain-looking and vulgar slips of girls but don`t even want to take those kids with them when they run away to another town. They say to their father that they want to marry English girls - no matter which ones. Why? Are all Pakistani girls as monster-like as their brides? They dislike Pakistani men too. 'There are thousands of them here!' - exclaims the younger brother in disgust, entering a town where many of his compatriots live. His mother is English - that`s the reason for the arrogance! And the filmmakers doubtlessly sympathize with all that. If this film were only a satire at the roughness of the Muslim family orders, it would have been all right.

But opposing them in this way is racism. Would you like to watch a skillfully made racist movie? If yes, I recommend you East is East.

All the ingredients for a fast-paced multiculti culture clash comedy are on the table. But I still got to resent this movie. The reason is that the makers decided to make this fluffy comedy also relevant, edgy and deep. That's like taking a mousse au chocolat and loading it with fibers and vitamins. In this case, the story starts out with an inept and somewhat backwards, but likable Pakistani dad who turns into Bin Ladin's evil, wife-beating, uglier brother halfway through the film. He's like a stereotype straight out of Enoch Powell's book. All this is decorated with plot holes the size of BP's Gulf-of- Mexico oil leak. For example, the parents discover that their ten-year-something son hasn't been circumcised. How could they fail to notice -- had they adopted him earlier that same day? And sailing under the flag of political correctness, the movie manages to round up almost every distasteful movie cliché in the book kids with glasses are nerds. It's OK to poke fun at fat chicks. Bullying is fun. Being sexually assaulted by a large dog is hilarious. Blonde chicks who wear makeup are white-trash slags, and it's OK to treat them like pieces of furniture. Homosexuals run enormous hat stores out of Eccles (OK, that one was new to me, but it's still not funny).Give me comedy. Give me drama. But if you want to give me both at the same time, you better know your cinematic onions.

However, I always had my doubts about it. Although it does have it's funny moments, the film is a basic bore. It starts off with the family in difficulties, and finishes in the same way. Maybe it was just not my cup of tea, but I have not sat through a film half asleep, since seeing water world. It had no plot, and no interesting twist. Really nothing happened. It may bring you a better understanding of how a mixed raced family lived, but personally I would not go and see this film if I was you.

I watched and wondered what all the hype was about.  I paid full price for this film when it hit the shelves and after watching it, I felt like I had been mugged.I couldn't see anything funny about it.  I mean...why am I actually bothering to review this rubbish.  It must be because I am trying to save some people from wasting their time and hard earned cash buying this junk.Just to set the picture and this is no word of a lie - I actually GAVE MINE AWAY!!!  Says it all really.  Please don't watch as it will feel like you were sucked into the black hole with nothing surrounding you and knowing you were gonna starve to death.PS.  I think they should put a TOXIC sign on the cover!

Good for a night in, so to speak. Oh, was I wrong.How exactly this film got such good reviews is beyond me. As a comedy, the one major drawback is the lack of anything humorous. It's virtually impossible to understand anything that George Khan says (and if this is supposed to be funny, it wears thin quickly) and the film overall goes nowhere very slowly.I actually gave up on this film before it finished. What a waste of £2.50. Goes to show you can't judge a book by its cover (or in this case, a video cassette by its reviews).1/10 - a completely dismal no hoper. Awful in every respect.  "}]
