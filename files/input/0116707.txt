And since few films even have that, perhaps we should celebrate.What stinks is all the normal mix of what usually makes a film the story (particularly the humor in the story), the acting, production and so on. But what works is a relative lack of constraint in what happens with the bugs.The Disney organization established a code which has become dogma. It sets pretty severe constraints on what a cartoon character can do in terms of bending reality or the normalcy of behavior. So Donald might get mad, but he doesn't turn himself inside out. Goofy's nose might get stretched, but he does have a nose. Walt's supposition was that the characters were surrogates for real people and if you break that wall, you bring into question all of the dramatic and comedic conventions he appropriates from real life.Essentially everyone follows this rule, and has thrived. The alternative world of animated creatures has a predictability to it. Ah, but that wall of expectations is a matter for humor too -- rare humor -- humor of the Marx Brothers variety. And here we have a Lenny Bruce-like piercing of the wall. Its outrageous in just the sort of way that South Park sometimes was.The Busby Berkeley routines really had me.

He actually believes he can find a decent apartment and a good job, but the apartments that rent for $1000 a month are not fit to live in. Fortunately, he meets Walter, an artist, whose latest project is to lie on the street in a pool of blood and see who notices. For two days, only Joe does. Walter tells Joe about rent control, and Joe is lucky enough to be there when the resident of one rent-control apartment dies. But the apartment Joe finds is no prize either, even though he can afford it. Hundreds or even thousands of roaches live there. Talking roaches. And the building is the last one left in an area where Senator Dougherty wants to build a federal prison. Only Joe is left in his building, and he is harassed to the point where most people would move out. The roaches encourage Joe to stand his ground and even help him out.When Joe calls 911, the call is answered by Dougherty's frustrated daughter Lily, who has taken charge of a community garden in Joe's neighborhood and wants her father to leave things as they are. Lily doesn't like her paying job because all she can do is put people on hold; there's no one to switch them to (I did like the nice music that was played).If you don't like 'Fear Factor', this movie might not be for you. But the roaches were so cute I wasn't really disgusted (even by their slightly off-color language). And they were quite talented. I liked most of their songs, which tended to be older music styles. They even did dance routines, including an Esther Williams style performance in a toilet.This movie was very funny at times. Some of the humor tended toward the demented, but I still enjoyed it.

You'll find yourself cheering for Joe, as a tender romance is played out against the backdrop of an epic of modern life, when New York's poorest and most forgotten residents learn to overcome their distrust of an outsider, and help him to find both success and love.Based on the novel of the same name (winner of both the 1994 Pulitzer Prize and the 1995 Nobel prize for literature) and adapted for the screen through the combined efforts of Maya Angelou and Salman Rushdie, the power and majesty of the screenplay has been shown to lower blood pressure, reduce acid reflux, and cure eczema (Wisconsin Dermatological Review, November 1999.) Both a critical success and smash hit (by the end of 2007, the cumulative worldwide box office exceeded $830 million) the film has been playing continuously to packed houses in New York, Los Angeles, London, Prague, and Rio de Janeiro for over eleven years. Its theme music was adopted in 2004 as the national anthem of Norway (this led to a brief but violent conflict with neighboring Finland, which had also sought to use the music for its anthem, until UN Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali declared before the General Assembly that Joe's Apartment should be considered part of humanity's common cultural heritage.)Upon his return from a much-publicized audience with Pope John Paul II, star Jerry O'Connell was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom by President Bill Clinton. The Dalai Lama (who at the time of this writing has seen the movie over 2300 times) was recently quoted in Newsweek as saying No feeling person can see Joe's Apartment and not be moved to tears by its urgent message that we must all embrace biological diversity in the fight against homelessness, crime, and political corruption. That this simple truth remains as relevant in today's society as when the film was made, is simply more proof of the prescience and timeless universality of the message.With its magnificent cinematography, lush musical score, and sensitive direction of the outstanding performances, it's easy to see why Joe's Apartment swept every major category in the 1997 Oscars, and is third on the AFI's list of the most ground-breaking films of all time. The artistry of this film recalls the heyday of Hollywood's past greatness, and will leave you both profoundly moved, and filled with renewed hope for the future of the world.Joe's Apartment is THE feel-good movie of the late '90s, a film that will warm the hearts of young and old, from your grandmother to your grandchildren. See it today, with someone you love.

I saw bits and pieces of this flick when I was around eight years old with my dad, and thought it was a horror film. Thousands of cockroaches and their scratchy voices running around a ceiling kicking two guy's asses sounds like a Horror film. I was surprised to find out it was a comedy film by none other than MTV. After all, this was all when I was eight.Like I stated, I went into this expecting a horrible film. It looked like a cheesy MTV film that lacked talent and humor. I was totally wrong. This film is now on the list of favorite MTV films. I always complain in my other reviews that movies have lost creativity and idea in recent years, I think I got what I asked for. Singing cockroaches? Haven't seen that done before! Joe (O'Connell) is a College grad who is having a hard time after moving to New York City. He can't find a place or a job to manage. After posing as a recently dead elderly women's son, he is able to get her Apartment at very cheap. Little does he know the podunk joint is home to over 5,000 singing and talking cockroaches.Joe must now cope with the roaches irrational behavior, as well as trying to score big with a local, garden nut named Lily (Ward). But there isn't a huge market for women who dig jobless men who have a home infested with thousands of cockroaches last I checked. I could be wrong though.I have seen the original short that this film is based on, and I hate cockroaches. Though seeing cheesy beta versions of themselves somehow made me tolerate them for 80 minutes. Plus Jerry O'Connell's likable persona was something that flowed nicely throughout the film.Joe's Apartment crosses the line of disgusting and becomes utterly filled with gross out humor and repulsive scenery of Joe's apartment. But it's a fun, creative movie that dares to go where no film has gone before. A disgusting slacker's apartment. Sure it seen briefly in films like Bio-Dome and Chairman of the Board, but to my recollection, I don't think a film has restricted it's boundaries to just a person's apartment. Gives me an idea for my fourth short film.Starring Jerry O'Connell, Megan Ward, Billy West, Robert Vaughn, Reginald Hudlin, Jim Turner, and Don Ho. Directed by John Payson.

The first joke is that he's looking for subsidized housing with a rent of $100/month (!) He finally settles on a seriously rundown tenement occupied by two American cockroaches named Randy and Ralph and their 5,000 singing and dancing family members(they're the big brown ones, folks, and they do fly in real life).

I checked the director's entire filmography, and it seems like everything he does involves cockroaches... no, revolves around them. I'm guessing he's either fascinated by them or infatuated with them. I'm not sure which I find more disturbing. I wager he's got some counseling in his future... or maybe he's just a very large child, passing for an adult. That is the only group of people this... 'film' could possibly appeal to. The plot is stupid and completely predictable, not to mention formulaic in every sense of the word. Absolutely no originality whatsoever. The pacing is surprisingly poor, for such a short film. The acting is sub-par. The writing is horrid. The songs sung by the cockroaches... don't get me started. The rest of the soundtrack just seems out of place. I know this was produced by MTV, but even for them, this is a new low. But apart from every negative I've written in this review, I must admit that I followed this film from the very beginning pretty much to the very end... something I rarely do anymore, except for when I'm at the cinema. Despite how much I hated it, I never took my eyes off it. Of course, this was probably just because this was aired during a violent lightning storm, and I was afraid if I turned on my computer before it was over, it might attract a bolt of lightning. Of course, if you need to believe otherwise... then go right ahead. I recommend this to children and people who enjoy childish humor. To give a quick example of said humor; one scene has the main character running around town, collecting feces from various animals. Yes, seriously. The film is incredibly poorly done, and very amateurish in just about every aspect, but I suppose the kids won't mind. Personally, I'd choose a cartoon over this any day... but different strokes for different blokes. 1/10 "},{"Title":"Strange and funny","Date":"16 September 2010","Score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Fantasy, Musical","Review":" I watched this movie a while back, and I have just Yesterday watched it again.

Even though I hate cockroaches I couldn't help but to like the singing cockroaches in this film. I love it in the end when there is a choire of cockroaches singing a love song, I was in stitches after hearing that. Though I think this film is more for the young teenagers who like toilette humour and kind of childish jokes. I have seen better comedies but this was quite good but like I have just written this film consists more of teenage kind of jokes rather than mature adult jokes. This is a kind of film which doesn't require brains as there is no complex story. If you just need to have a laugh this is a recommended film, like I said it was a very stupid film but very entertaining.

All human characters are pure caricatures and many are more revolting than the bugs themselves. Jerry O'Connell is likeable however in the leading human role, doing his best to assure us of his honesty. As his great love, Megan Ward, looks pretty but has a range in her acting that only runs from A to B. This could also be said for a script that is totally inadequate when it is not dealing with cockroaches and sometimes unforgivably obsessed with toilet-humour. The cockroaches, one the other hand, are very funny and got inventive musical numbers along with some funny one-liners. Special effects are effective and the movie moves along at a brisk pace so you never got a chance to be bored or too disgusted. Everything ends on a happy note and the movie as a whole is harmless fun.

High-pitched singing is really all that Joe's Apartment has going for it.  Make the high-pitched singers cockroaches, and you can rope in older viewers who wouldn't dare admit even to themselves that they still find the Chipmunks kind of fun to listen to.  The plot is perfunctory - it tries to make its perfunctory nature into a knowing joke, and fails - and the love story is poisoned by irony.

Amid the Loony Toons slapstick there are some good sight gags and some diverting hijinks. Mercifully the roaches are not quite as disgusting as possible.Jerry O'Connell plays a Wayne's World kind of sweet guy who spends a lot of time on his back surrounded by the Lilliputian roaches who even tie him down. But he gets the girl, the beautiful and talented Megan Ward, who has little to do other than mug, which she does very prettily.Nonetheless there is a strange pull to this loser-ID flick perhaps it is a metaphor for the world in which we live, surrounded by filth and the ever-present reminder that cockroaches will inherit the earth.(Note Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!

Joe is played by Jerry O'Connell, who had the lead whiz-kid role in the TV series Sliders.  His girlfriend Lily's father, a scheming congressman afflicted with deviant sexual fetishism (and therefore obviously a Democrat), is played by the remains of Robert Vaughn. But of course the real stars are the hordes of digitally animated cockroaches who infest Joe's NYC digs.  They not only talk, they also sing, dance, and do synchronized swimming in the toilet.  Joe, an Iowa innocent new to the Big Apple, is horrified when the bugs take a liking to him because he's their kind of slob.  But his new friends are impossible to get rid of, just like in real life, so Joe just has to make the best of the situation.  Otherwise, the plot is dumb to the point of irrelevance the congressman wants to level Joe's building, the last one on its East Village block, to make way for the vast new Manhattan Maximum Security Prison (which makes him a Democrat who's caved in to Republican priorities -- again, just like real life).  But Lily wants to make the block into a park-like garden.  See?  Just the sort of tooth-grindingly stupid drek that begs to be livened up by swarms of wisecracking, punning, music-loving arthropods.  As silly fun, it works quite well, and would make an interesting second feature after Phase IV, a dead-serious 1974 SF effort about a colony of intelligent ants in the Arizona desert.

Joe's Apartment runs out of ideas before the halfway point. The Character Joe rents out an apartment, occupied by acres of cockroaches, who sing and dance and give Joe unwanted company. OK, we get it already.So how does a film revolving around annoying little roaches extend to 90 minutes? By adding in that predictable subplot involving the hard-to-get love interest for Joe of course, who the viewers automatically know will end up together by the end of the movie. Haven't we seen this predictable boy-gets-girl plot in countless other films? Well, not with singing and dancing roaches. I'll give it that.Joe somewhat befriends the roaches, even they are annoying and give him grief. Consider a scene where Joe brings a date to his apartment. The roaches hide, and the date suspects nothing. Soon after, when things look as if they're going well for Joe, the roaches fall out of the chandelier and fall all over Joe's date. Soon after, roaches everywhere, terrifying the girl. Joe tells her it's OK, but what woman is going to listen to that? So what does Joe do? He may start off as mad, but he always forgives them. This angers me. These are vindictive, controlling, and annoying roaches who, if I was occupied with them, would drive me to a point to get my apartment exterminated. These roaches cause Joe nothing but grief, and torture, and they invade his privacy; yet the film is supposed to make us laugh.When the film reaches its inevitable conclusion, I was so annoyed and disgusted by this time that I couldn't feel any of the euphoria the film was trying to feed its viewers. It didn't work.The film was made my MTV studios and it looks like it should have been a made-for-TV film specifically for MTV. I have not seen the short on which this was based, but I assume it was funnier that this film - it would rely on the roaches singing and dancing routine(s), without the subplots that a full length film has to have to reach its 90 minutes, which just made the cockroaches grow annoying, crude, mean, and tiresome.

I cannot remember if I finished watching the film, as I seem to have blacked out as a result of the extreme trauma of having this unfiltered cinematic excrement thrust into my eyes. The film primarily fails because the cockroaches in it are NOT endearing in any sort of way at all.  They are gross, dispicable, loathsome creatures as rendered by the flick's F/X.  Also, the film backfired majorly by featuring master thespian Jerry O'Connell, who disgraces his passable work in both Stand By Me and  Crossing Jordan by appearing in the filth that is Joe's Apartment.  He should've been arrested for bad acting after this debackle.  Third, the film doesn't work because of the plot device of urinal cakes.  There is no reason in the five rhelms of hell why urinal cakes should ever be featured in a film at all.  What's so funny about these oversized pee-flavored breath mints anyway?
