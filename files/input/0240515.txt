[{"Title":"Tom Green, you sicken me","Date":"23 October 2005","Score":"30 out of 48 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy","Review":" Freddy got Fingered is about a slacker cartoonist named Gord, Tom Green, who finally moves out of his parents basement to work at Hollywood in a cheese sandwich factory and try to sell off his cartoons for them to become a TV show. But when a big time Hollywood producer, Michael Anthony Hall, tells him he will never make it in life, Gord moves back home with his sleazy father played by Rip Torn. Gord's life is then turned into a big contests where he and his dad try to settle an age old battle between whether Gord should suck up and become a man or be a complete loser for the rest of his life.Freddy Got Fingered, should have been named Animals Got Fingered. I'll admit that I'm not a big Tom Green fan but by the way the trailers for the film worked it looked life it would be an okay movie. I was wrong! Tom Green proves right here in this movie that he can not act or direct. This film losses effort on every film making level but it succeeds in being a master in every bad level of film making. This film is a complete waste of talent and time with animal masturbation and blow job jokes. Plus the title, what is with the title? Sure Gord says that his father fingered his younger brother Freddy but that subject is only in the film for eight minutes top! Now the main character Gord must be mentally retarded. In one of the most sickest scenes in the movie, Gord finds a dead deer in the middle of the road. He remembers the words of Mr. Davidson telling him he needs to get inside his cartoon animals so they can be more lively. But to Gord he thinks he should literally get inside the deer! He cuts the animals stomach open and rips out it's insides. Then we see cute little animals roaming the forests to the sweet melody of a female singer only to be interrupted with Gord running around, shrieking like a retard and wearing the deers bloody body as as a coat. I was about to blow chunks after I saw that scene. Maybe this movie might be funny to some of you people if you like Tom Green licking bloody wounds, playing with animals privates, or swinging a dead baby around a hospital by it's cord you may laugh till you die! But people like me will just be disgusted by this movie. I only chuckled a few times in this movie, like twice! Freddy Got Fingered gets the low 1, if I could though I would give it a zero. Tom Green, you sicken me.

But up until last night, I had never walked out on one.I went to see Freddie Got Fingered with little expectation.  The trailer looked mildly entertaining and I've seen a few skits with Tom Green that were funny and thought he was pretty funny in Charlie's Angels.  So I went in figuring that there would be some chuckles and maybe even a couple of knee slappers.  If there were any after the first 30 minutes (past the swinging-baby-on-the-umbilical-cord) scene, I missed them.I watched, and kept hoping it would get funny.  Maybe it'll get funny after he guts the deer and wears the carcass.  Nope?  Maybe it'll get funny after he jerks off a horse.  Nope?  Maybe it'll get funny after he licks an open fracture on his best friend's leg.  *sigh*  Nope.  Maybe it'll get funny after he swings the baby around on the umbilical cord.  I'm not sure. That's where I walked out and went to see the last half of Joe Dirt. (Which I had seen in its entirety on the weekend before)  I felt better about switching movies but felt badly that I couldn't have taken my money back from Tom Green and given it to David Spade, Dennis Miller, Kid Rock and Christopher Walken, who actually made a movie that was both funny and entertaining.

Compare Green's deer (elk?) scene (where he guts and wears a road-kill animal with antlers) with Jim Carey's dead cow scene in (I think) Me, Myself and Irene and you might get an idea of how different the two approaches are.There isn't a genuinely funny moment in FGF but there are more than enough cringe-worthy, awful ones. This might have made a great 15-minute short but, as a feature it doesn't even get to first base. Some will say it's 'off the wall' and that's why people don't get it.

How about to say that at a voter standing of only 3.7 out of 10, Freddy Got Fingered is the most over rated film in the entire IMDB.As someone who does like crude and gross out humor, when done right, I still found this to be the most pathetic attempt at a film I have ever seen. For a start lets begin with the plot. Tom Green leaves his parents home to become an animator. Tom Green returns. Tom Green and his dad get into many heated arguments - thats about it for plot. The rest of the film revolves around Tom participating in the kind of bizarre behavior that has made him famous - only this time its way more over the top. Masturbating horses - licking the bone of a friend's broken leg as he screams in agony, swinging a new born baby around by its umbilical cord are all part of the 'comedy' of Freddy Got Fingered. And none of this actually has anything to do with the 'plot'.Consider those above as deterrents instead of spoilers.The Tom Green show is funny for ONE REASON - and ONE REASON only. The joke is on the unsuspecting public. Tom Green's antics are only funny for his ability to carry them out in public and for his complete lack of embarrassment. In this film the antics are scripted. Those on the receiving end of these antics are actors. Therefore it is NOT FUNNY, as the only thing that makes this guy funny is canceled out. I still can't believe that the people at 20th Century Fox couldn't figure this out. The fact that they actually sunk huge amounts of money into this film is not only sad, but offensive. Did anyone involved in this movie actually think this would be funny?In short - the worst film I have ever seen. A lot of people use that term as a knee jerk exaggeration to describe a film they didn't like. This is no exaggeration. My previous all time worst film, Glam, maybe even deserves awards compared to this (OK maybe that was an exaggeration). Hopefully this is the last time that Tom Green will ever get to make a movie. If Fox gives the go ahead for Freddy Got Fingered 2, I'll trash the set myself.

But all that is completely unnecessary - the movie is abominably stupid and that's all it aimed at. I also heard that if you don't find this movie funny you need to be more laid back and get a sense of humour. I mean, I'm pretty sure I have a sense of humour, but the giggles this movie elicits mirror those of an elementary school kid who has just found out that sexual intercourse entails penetrating the vagina with the penis. Yet does jacking off an elephant, or severing an umbilical cord with your teeth and spraying the delivery room with maternal blood really bring out the child in us? As far as I'm concerned it doesn't, but one thing is for sure. Whatever laughs the movie gets (and I *believe* it is intended as a comedy) are laughs of shock. The movie shows us freak show style strangeness and we are so confused the only reaction we can come up with is laughter. And maybe the movie succeeds on that level. But I didn't find it that shocking, and I'm sure that in a few years a hundred other movies will beat its grossness and, sometimes, just plain sadistic ugliness. The movie is sadistic (I won't bother to describe the plot), and the main character enjoys tormenting other people. I don't know if this is what is supposed to be funny, but it certainly leads to no point and is more annoying than anything else. The whole movie, in fact, is just plain retarded. And I mean retarded in its objective, critical sense, not in any derogatory way.

I cannot see what anyone sees in this piece of crap.Before Freddy Got Fingered I did not hate Tom Green. In fact, I thought he was funny in Road Trip. So what drugs did he take to come up with this film? Green is the writer/director, and star of the film. It is actually rather easy to say which one he does the worst job at.Green's direction actually means nothing in the film, but it is rather blandly directed. Even though, Green's direction is lackluster it is unlikely that even an accomplished director could turn this into something worthwhile.Arguably, Green's worst job is that of a writer. The plot is meaningless in this film. It is just there for Green to do some stupid things that we are supposed to think is funny. How in the hell can people find this funny? Jacking off an Elephant? Biting an umbilical cord? Walking around with a deer carcass on? These are excruciatingly unfunny and stupid.The acting is nothing good. Rip Torn and Drew Barrymore are so incredibly over the top that its almost funny(almost but not quite). Julie Hagerty is completely forgettable (thats more of a good thing).Two things are worth mentioning in this s***hole of a film. First, Tom Green running around screaming in a building.

Mess with old people, play with animals and their corpses, run around screaming to get disturbed reactions from people.

I've read several comments on this site to the effect that Tom Green, via this film, did what he wanted to do (as if that's a viable excuse for this pile of filth,) and continued his assault in American middle-class mores with this flick. What Tommy forgot is that it's primarily those middle-class types who buy theater tickets. There is nothing that requires them to like what he does. So if his goal was to give the finger to America's middle-class types who hated his brand of humor, while simultaneously damaging the credibility of 20th Century Fox, causing investors to lose a load of money and making himself appear to be a blithering idiot, I'd say he's attained his goals. Almost 5 years later and his film is still regarded with contempt. If the hope is that it will ever become a cult classic, the folks touting it had better hurry.Green can indeed do what he likes, but his defenders are fools for thinking his work is praiseworthy based on that. In WWII, Heinrich Himmler did what he wanted to do as well. It was also gory, sadistic, filthy, outrageous and sick. So, is his memory to be blessed and pardoned just because he did what he wished in violation of all civilized standards? It cracks me up how Green's supporters react to criticism of the film by accusing critics of being old farts, and/or lacking a sense of humor. One commentator on this site even said such people have an incomplete sense of humor. If that's the case, I shall leave my sense of humor incomplete. The result is like that Schubert Symphony and the famous portrait of Geo. Washington-- unfinished but still esthetically pleasing.I feel for Rip Torn and Julie Hagerty, that they ever immersed themselves in this vomit; Anthony Michael Hall (Michael Hall today) was rescued by TV's The Dead Zone. Green's career virtually collapsed after this was released and he has only staggered to his feet again in recent years.I wouldn't normally wish this, but I hope Green fails in everything he does for the rest of his life.

Freddy has got to be the most horribly written and directed movie I've seen since Battlefield Earth.  To add furthur insult to an already doomed movie is a horrible acting job done by Tom Green, whose soul comedic approach is to make an ass of himself whenever the opportunity arises.  Why must Tom Green always wander into a scene, doing something stupid and making an excuse as to why he is doing it? Then repeat that lame excuse over-and-over again?Tom Green reminds me of that guy in class that did dumb things to get attention, and people laughed, which made him believe he was popular, he continued to do it, not realizing that people were laughing AT him.  But that's just my opinion.OK, the plot goes like this, Gord Brody (Tom Green) in an aspiring cartoonist who gets rejected by a cartoon company for his lame ideas, he returns home, lives with his parents and does a bunch of stuff.  That's it. Everything.  The fact that I summed up the whole plot in less than two sentences speaks for itself.The biggest fault that FGF has is the fact that it tries to shock more than it tries to be funny, many times it had me wondering why 20th Century Fox gave Tom Green a budget to begin with.  Jacking a horse is not funny, swinging a newborn baby by the umbilical cord with blood splattering around is just sick, if you enjoy this, then please go out and rent Dumb & Dumber and watch that, that is shock/bathroom humour done properly.  Not subtle, but not over-the-top, combine that with some talented comedians and a good premise, then you have a great film.I am being really harsh with this movie, so I will even everything out by listing some things I did like about it.  The shower scene with Green in a scuba suit looking for lost treasure was amusing, as was the animated Zebras in America sketch at the end.  The daddy would you like some sausage? scene could have been decent as well, if not for it being shown 234,213 times in the previews.  Other times, this movie failed to please or amuse.  The acting hurt most of all, Rip Torn is the only one whose performance was just as painful as the star, just seeing him show his bare behind while drunk and saying to Green **** me! will set back his career at least a decade.  I just wanted to reach through the screen and smack Torn upside the head for saying Yes to this project.Horrible, barely funny in any respect, if that was Tom Green's purpose, then he succeeded, but that does not equal a likeable movie.  The fact that there are Hollywood executives marketing THIS crap to my demographic, thinking we like it, is something I take great offense to.  Tom Green did waste 15 million of 20th Century Fox's money and 90 minutes of my time, hopefully we both learned from this disaster.

How me and my girlfriend managed to finish watching it is beyond me. We kept hoping that there were going to be some redeeming moments that would produce a laugh or two and it was going to get better, but all in vain. I should've turned it off when I felt the first urge to do so... which was 5 minutes into it. How a character like Tom Green remains at large is beyond me. How he became a Hollywood star I am not even going to attempt to explain. All this malarkey said here by people who somehow managed to like this disaster of a film that you need to just be really open minded and have a good sense of humor, not take yourself too seriously and you will like it is just that - malarkey. I am very open minded and have a very good sense of humor (and so does my girlfriend - we're some of the most easy going people you will ever find), but this movie is just plain unfunny, idiotic and disgusting. When one watches is it one gets a distinct feeling of disbelief that someone in Hollywood actually spent a lot of money on making something like this. That is even taking in consideration the fact that more then half the movies that are coming out of Hollywood are total crap. That is inevitable with the amount of films being produced, but this one is so shockingly bad that I just do not understand how anyone would provide funding for it. I guess it was justified because they figured that there would be enough people who would go and watch it. It is at least nice to hear that most left the theater before it was over. That is the good news. The other piece of good news that can possibly be found here is that if a talentless wackjob like Tom Green could become a star and get 20th Century Fox to pony up cash for a project like this anyone can become a star. So for all the brainless buffoons out there - there is hope for you people. If watching the most gruesome scenes ever conceived in absolutely horrible taste is your idea of funny than you will enjoy it. To each his own as they say and I'm not here to judge you. Yeah, right. To me you have to be a total tool to find anything good in this movie. Everything in  this flick just made us cringe rather then laugh. Some here said that this was one of the funniest movies they have ever seen. Perhaps this flick could be useful in weeding out complete wackos. I think it is pretty safe to take whoever laughs until their stomach hurts at this one, load them up on trucks and take them far, far away. We will all thank Tom Green for a service he has provided this way. Someone said that it should be commended for the strong reaction it produced. I love it how people try to reach to justify just about anything sometimes. To you I say this. When you step into a pile of feces while walking on the street it also produces quite a strong reaction, doesn't it? This one is right up there... or should i say right down there with Scary Movie 2.

On the IMDb's 1 to 10 scale, I think I'd give this movie a V.I saw this film explicitly for the purpose of mockery.  Given its absolute dreadful reviews, I figured it was a no-brainer for the kind of crappy movie my friends and I enjoy getting together to watch and laugh at.  If I was expecting a bomb, I got a piece of fruit.  Or maybe I got a piece of a horse's anatomy, since that is actually in the film.  Twice.This is said by a guy who has watched, and occassionally enjoyed Tom Green's MTV show.  His sheer enthusiasm for pissing people off is something to behold, if not applaud.  And he was funny in his limited screen time in Road Trip.The difference between his television antics and his film antics, is that on television is he making people on screen uncomfortable and we are able to sit back and laugh at them; while in the movie we are forced to sit through Green's bizarre and often grotesque antics completely unfiltered.  There is no one to laugh at here.  On Green's show, he'd have put a camera in the theater where this thing is shown and let you, the viewer, watch the horror on the faces of those he'd suckered into watching it.That would have been hilarious.  This, instead, is uncomfortable in a truly unique way.  Green plays Gord Brody, an aspiring animator who has a highly strained relationship with his father Jim, played by Rip Torn, who matches Green's insane antics with gusto that's at once impressive and shameful.You wouldn't suspect it just by looking at young Gord, but his dreams reach far beyond those of a lucrative animation contract.  He also wants to play with a male horse's genitals, which he accomplishes on the way to Hollywood. He also wants to build a half pipe to skateboard on.  He does so, and when his friend goes for a first ride he promptly breaks his leg, and Gord suckles on the protruding bone and flesh while his father yells angrily. Oh, that wacky Gord.The film goes on and on like this; lord knows what PETA thought of the scene with Gord and a dead deer, just after he's received the advice to get inside the animals.Green's ability to direct and write (anything but disgusting material) don't rate with his knack for freaking people out.  To call this weird thing misguided is the unterstatement of a lifetime.  I don't know how this movie could have been made to play as entertainment for audiences who aren't totally in love with Green's offbeat persona.

Basically, this is one of the most disgusting comedies ever made.  It's vile, unfunny and just has the most horrible sequences I've ever seen.  They include an old man in a walker being knocked down; Green masturbating a horse; Green cutting open a dead deer and wearing its skin (!!!);  horses having sex; a little boy getting hit by a car with blood all over him--he is later hit in the face with a baseball, over the head with a bottle and chopped up by plane blades--all for laughs; a man falls down, breaks his leg and, while he's screaming in pain, Green licks the bone sticking out of his leg; Green helping a woman give birth, biting off the umbilical cord and swinging the baby around sprewing blood all over...this is all within the first half hour!!!  It just gets worse and worse with tons of disgusting humor, loads of swearing and talented actors like Torn, Drew Barrymore and Hagerty struggling to maintain their dignity.  Torn especially has it bad--at one point he bares his behind for laughs.  Sad.There are two good performances--Anthony Michael Hall as David Davidson and Marisa Coughlan as Betty--a woman in a wheelchair who gets sexually excited when Green beats her feet with a bamboo stick--this is shown three times. The whole movie ends with a truly desperate, pointless ending which tries to throw in a little moral lesson!I almost stopped watching five times out of pure disgust but braced myself.

How about falsely reporting incestuous fondling (from whence the movie title comes)?Tom Green apparently thought so.

So back home, he is still living with his not too kind father Jim (Razzie nominated Rip Torn) and nice mother Julie (Airplane's Razzie winning Julie Hagerty), and he also has fallen for paralysed nurse Betty (Marisa Coughlan), who doesn't want real romance, she just wants to suck him off, and get her legs beaten (for pleasure) with a bamboo cane. Gord is seen by a shrink, but to get away he lies and tells her that his father has fingered (like the title suggests, I thought it was like a criminal conviction thing) his brother Freddy (American Pie's Eddie Kaye Thomas). So he has the house to himself for a while, but he manages to come up with a great cartoon idea, called Zebras in America, based on his own family, and the cartoon guy is only convinced when Gord's father shows up being rude, and he earns $1,000,000.

Randomness can be funny, but there still has to be some sense in the randomness, like in Monty Python movies. Here it's total randomness. The main person in this movie could be best described as a lunatic, and the movie depicts the acts of this lunatic.

The film has no arc, no genuine plot development, and not a single character is likable (not to be confused with the Byronic-Heros of films like A Clockwork Orange,). The vast majority of the scenes serve no purpose at all in the film. Those who claim that the film is not just a 'gross-out' comedy are sadly mistaken. There is no second interpretation of an elephant masturbation scene. It does not 'portray' anything remotely deeper than the superficiality of it's repulsiveness. Those who claim that this film is similar to other shunned films at their debut (references to A Clockwork Orange and The Shining) are using inaccurately transitive properties. It's like saying that since slavery abolitionists of the 1800's were initially unpopular, yet now are heroes, that neo-nazis should be held as heroes since they are presently unpopular. Not to mention that the films cited above were unpopular because they filmed scenes that were supplemental to the plot, yet appeared graphic, and ultimately enhanced the social commentary. THERE IS NO SOCIAL COMMENTARY IN A BABY-SWINGING FILM. And don't try and claim that 'individuality' angle. Charles Manson was 'individual' too. In conclusion, do not watch this film. If you are thinking about watching it because you heard so many bad reviews and think it would be entertaining in it's awfulness, go no further. This film deserves no respect. It is a stain on the art of films.

It is pretty much Green doing what he does on his show but here it isn't funny because we are so used to him acting like an idiot to unsuspecting people, him acting like an idiot for no reason isn't all that funny. It also takes the term gross out comedy to new levels as Green masturbates a horse and elepant, bites through an imbilical cord and so on.

Tom Green has said in interviews that in making his feature film debut with Freddy Got Fingered, he wanted to shock audiences and make them uncomfortable, just as he did on his MTV show bearing his name.  Well, after viewing this movie, I can only say....MISSION ACCOMPLISHED on that goal!  Unfortunately, even his fans will probably be let down by what transpires on-screen.  The movie is a smorgasbord of disgusting, gross-out  humor built on beyond-tasteless subject matter...child abuse and sexual molestation of animals, just to name two.  It's like Green is trying to out-Farrelly the Farrelly Brothers, but he's so eager to bludgeon us with his audacity, that the gags fly by with surprisingly little outrageousness and even less comic payoff.  I found myself grimacing and groaning more than laughing at the non-stop spray of blood, bodily fluids and sado-masochistic gags.  I suppose this is Green's schtick, but it's a one-note affair that quickly grows very wearying.  Even though I don't consider myself a fan, I'm willing to give Green the benefit of the doubt.  He's clearly not untalented, but he's likely to wear out his welcome fast if he continues unvaried on this track.The basic premise could have made for a very amusing film.  Green plays a bizarre, childish 28-year old man who winds up moving back into his parents' home after repeatedly failing to make it on his own, driving both family and friends to exasperated distraction with his antics, especially his disapproving Dad.  Comedian Chris Elliot mined  a somewhat similar idea to MUCH better effect with his under-rated sitcom Get A Life several years back, melding his smart-aleck persona to inventive absurdist comedy and childlike whimsy.  Green uses the storyline here as little more than a vehicle to get from one tasteless set-piece to the next.....no style, no flair, no laughs.I'm a big fan of gross-out humor (I busted a gut at movies like American Pie, Road Trip, and the Farrelly Brothers films) and even gruesome black comedies (call me sick, but I think Peter Berg's Very Bad Things is an absolute classic) but Freddy Got Fingered just left me cold.

I decided to give this film a try. First of all, this film is in really bad taste and it is a struggle to get into it because of that reason. However this is not to say that it can't be funny &#150; plenty of film push the taste barrier and still manage to be funny; although I do acknowledge that jokes about sexual abuse and child violence is not so much pushing the bounds of taste as it is crashing through them. The problem with the film is not just that it is in horrible bad taste (for that it is) but also that it is simply not funny at all; no, not even once. Outside of the shock value of the subject the film falls flat at every possible opportunity with material that can surely only appeal to the most juvenile of teenage boys. Outside of this audience I doubt many will find it funny at all because it is just dumb to the point of being puerile.The vast majority of the blame for this must lie with Tom Green &#150; a man who I have yet to see a funny vehicle; I'm assured this man has fans but I have never met one and, to be honest, hope I never do. As writer and director he is responsible for the film failing as spectacularly as it does but this is to ignore the part his actual performance plays in the failure. As an actor he is horribly over the top &#150; favouring mugging and stupidity over wit, timing or genuine humour. Rip Torn amazingly manages to do this film without looking embarrassed, which shows how good an actor he is because he really must have been crying inside. Coughlan is awful, although a big part of the problem is her character, which is offensive from start to finish. Thomas is handed some horrible scenes and at least has the decency to look ashamed. Hagerty must wish she could get another Airplane and Drew Barrymore must really love Green to have gotten involved in this film (although not enough to talk him out of it in the first place).Overall this is a terrible film. The material is crude and tasteless throughout and shocking and sickening the audience seems to have been the whole aim here. This in itself is bad but the real death of the film is in the fact that it is simply not funny at all, with every funny scene totally misjudged and generally offensive.

Sort of a sick hobby I have. So, if I hear really, really awful things about a movie chances are I'm going to rent it. That was the case with Freddy Got FingeredI've seen many terrible films. There are many different ways to screw up a movie, from the obvious crime mystery film, to the not-scary horror movie. I think all the very worst films are genre films that fail at that genre's defining quality, and Freddy Got Fingered fits that bill - perhaps the worst type of film there is, a comedy that isn't funny.I admit, I was one of those who for a month or two enjoyed the Tom Green Show fad on MTV. However, as we all knew deep inside, staying power wasn't an attribute that this poor-man's Jim Carrey possessed. (could anything be worse than being called a poor-man's Jim Carrey?)Anyways. Road Trip was nothing special, but funny and inventive at times. Tom Green has always been one who thrived on pushing the limits of decency as a way of getting you to laugh. Freddy Got Fingered (written and directed by Green if I recall) certainly attempts this, and there were quite a few times where I questioned whether the R rating was severe enough. So, preface this review with the general idea that Freddy Got Fingered is a push-the-limits comedy that isn't funny.Basically, half of the film (and indeed Tom Green's career) revolves around this comic premise First, Green touches, does, or places in his mouth something revolting. Second, he repeats some jibberish over and over. Third, he continues repeating the jibberish louder, while making faces a 3 year old would be jealous of, while running around the scene flapping his arms or rolling on the ground.The other half of the scenes are built around this joke Green does something stupid. His father swears at him like a drunken sailor. Green swears back. Not funny the first time, let alone the 20th time.There, basically I have summed up the plot. Oh, there is some bit about his dream to be a famous animator and having his own cartoon about a cat with x-ray vision, or centaur-looking zebra things, but if you remember that after seeing green masturbate a horse, chew through an umbilical cord, suck on the bone protruding from a compound fracture, gut a road-killed deer to wear its corpse like a fur coat, or beat a paraplegic senseless, then you are a much hardier moviegoer than I am.These things are supposed to make you laugh, but after several episodes of his TV show, and his first movie, seeing him lick something gross and scrunch up his face while babbling incoherently just doesn't do it for me anymore. I laughed one time during this movie, when Green is getting off a plane and someone in the awaiting crowd held up a sign that said when is this movie going to end? or something to that effect. It was almost a cop-out, as if to say the makers of this film threw that in hoping people would think they meant the movie to be this bad.There are no redeeming qualities to this film. There are no reasons to see it at all, because (A) it's not funny, (B) it will probably make you sick, and (C) no one needs to spend money on this type of crap, because it only encourages hollywood to generate more.0 out of 5 stars, with a rude gesture to those responsible.

No? Tom Green has already done that so don't even bother with such immoral suggestions. I don't hate shock humor but I detest attempts to use a feeble story to justify irrelevant acts of bestiality, child violence, and Tom Green stunts suitable for MTV reality shows. I excuse Jackass for their mind-boggling antics being that it is their careers to pull stunts like shooting fireworks near their butts. No story needed. But there comes a point in time when you must ask yourself during a movie What's the fu**ing point?Gord Brody (played by Tom Green) has goals of being a cartoon animator but the best job he can get is a job at a Hollywood cheese sandwich factory. Unsatisfied with his job and failed ambitions, Gord moves back to his parent's Portland home to continue his already annoying behavior. Very unbecoming of his antagonistic father (played by Rip Torn), who is the only character I could sympathize with for dealing with a black sheep. To our astonishment, Gord manages to score with a rocket scientist (played by Marisa Coughlan) who is wheelchair-bound and orgasms when having her legs whacked. So there you go, the basic points in this movie, the rest is about Tom Green performing unnatural, random crap. Oh, you want to know the meaning of the title? Fine. At some point, Gord decides to exact revenge on his dad for breaking one of his possessions. How? By falsely accusing him of sexually molesting Freddy (played by Eddie Kaye Thomas), Gord's younger adult brother. He's a full-grown man and he's sent to an institute for sexually-abused children. Do you want to know the sad part? The subject doesn't come up again.I'll make a couple of confessions in this review. First, I want to admit I love hating this movie so much. Second, just because I may laugh at some scenes doesn't mean I like, admire, or enjoy what I'm seeing. The only thing I genuinely laughed at was when Rip Torn cracked a cripple joke. I feel ashamed for it too. One last confession this is a movie which made me so mad I impulsively blurted F**k you near the end. I know you'll understand why after seeing the elephant.None of the stunts in Green's movie make logical sense to his character's objectives. Instead, we see the sporadic actions of an animal-abusing, spoiled, socially and mentally-retarded moron. God, I sound like Keith Olbermann but bear with me, please. Should I rig my fingers with sausages on strings while playing keyboard music to be more creative in this review? What may work for Gord may not work for me. From showering with scuba gear to swinging newborns by their umbilical cords, Gord's sickness doesn't deserve any pity and can only isolate viewers from rooting for him.If you think I'm going to be merely offended by broken teeth and animal masturbation, you got another thing coming. The cast generally has mean, heartless roles to support the dismal, annoying performance of Tom Green. His performance serves only one purpose it challenges us to deal with his immaturity for an hour-and-a-half. I honestly cannot name one performance that wasn't awkward, annoying, or embarrassing. And don't even go there with Rip Torn; you're more likely to laugh at him than with him.Even Green's direction sucks. Don't believe me? Look at the trailer of Gord in the factory with a cheese-helmet and you'll notice that the movie doesn't even show his stunt until we see him with a zoomed out shot of it on the conveyor belt. Instead, the scene plays out during the rolling credits. That's how lousy and inept this movie is. I'm impressed how the status of Green's movie has changed over time but it still won't affect my opinion. An awful movie is an awful movie. I really don't care if this movie has obtained a cult status or people understood Green was deliberately intent on destroying art, Freddy Got Fingered is the ultimate shame of comedic cinema if not one of the worst movies I have ever seen.My Rating 1/10 "},{"Title":"Oh please someone tell him he's not funny","Date":"23 February 2003","Score":"8 out of 10 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy","Review":"  This film is by far the worst I've seen for some time.

I am suppose to believe that critics who panned this movie were actually hurt by this movie because Tom Green got their goat?  The critics didn't get the joke?  Tom Green is ahead of his time?I have a hobby of late.  I read critics picks then rent the WORST reviewed movies to see how often the critics are uptight because they refused to laugh.  Examples include Dumb and Dumber and Tommy Boy.  These movies were panned by the critics because the critics tried to understand them.  What was there to understand?  They were just funny, silly, dopey movies.Then I came across the blistering reviews of Freddy Got Fingered.  I had to rent it for myself.  I soon found that yes, the 'Fingered' in the title refers to what one does to another's lower body orifice.  How funny.I am hardly a prude.  My wife and I occasionally rent from the adult racks to maintain a creative and stimulated relationship. I loved Pulp Fiction because of the creative writing and how the story turned full circle.  That was a violent film, yet riveting.Freddy Got Fingered is a truly disturbing movie.  Let me be overly kind and give the writers a pass on plot and even the bizarre nature of the main character.  We often give a pass to Chris Farley and Adam Sandler for their obnoxious and often times mentally disturbed movie personalities.  We often give their plots a pass as they are merely vehicles for humor.However, with Freddy Got Fingered, the humor (I use the term 'humor' loosely - and I should preface it with 'attempted') is just plain jaw dropping.  There is nothing and I mean NOTHING creative or funny about Tom Green.He must be an arrogant guy who truly believes in his own greatness.  Why else would his character stop a car in the middle of a highway for no apparent reason, hop a fence and grab hold of a horse's penis?  And I mean a full fledged, fully erect horse penis.  I am 38 years old and have never seen a horse's penis, nor did I know what one looked like.  But thanks to Tom Green's creative genius I now know. That scene could only be toped by an elephant ejaculating.  Tom Green delivers! HUH????Tom goes on to gut a road kill and carry the blood soaked skin on his back for no apparent reason.  Nice image.  Oh, and you got to love the child birth scene where he spins a fetus around his head by it's umbilical cord as blood splatters all four walls of the room.  Lovely.I have never heard of Tom Green.  When I first read the review I was wondering Who is Tom Green, how can he be a director already, and who would finance his movies?  Well, I am sure he has some cult following somewhere and some long haired pointy head round rimmed dope smoking college kid who thinks his work is pure genius!Hardly.

It simply appears to be a shock film, in which Tom Green tries to top all of his previous stunts, as well as those seen on Jackass, which eclipsed his show on MTV. There is little surprise, that after this travesty, Tom Green has disappeared from the public eye completely (except when he was dumped by Drew...what a shame).This movie is worth seeing, only so that you may say you have witnessed the worse, foulest, most worthless footage ever committed to videotape. It's great fun to mock, except for the fact that it constantly sickens you. I completed my viewing of this horrible thing wanting to kill myself...only after I killed Tom Green.

Yet, all I have to say is that those critics simply blew the situation way out of proportion. Yes, the film is crude, offensive, vulgar, and most of all &#150; just plain awful. But then again, what the hell did they expect from Tom green? Some executive at Fox must have heard that Tom Green was the new hot thing and decided to give him a contract to write and direct his own movie. That man is certainly fired as of now.       This film is silly and morally offensive. Yet, surely it is all in good fun. The only thing is that it isn't fun. Besides a running plot gag having the same child getting injured in an extraordinary set of circumstances every thirty minutes, this film lacks laughs and is merely aiming for shock value.      Furthermore, classic actor Rip Torn loses all credibility as he turns in the worst performance of his life as an alcoholic drunk father who apparently molests his youngest child, hence the title. And Tom green does not play the title character. Yet, the craziness does not stop there. I did not mention the plot yet.       This film works on the notion of Green's character; Gord, returning home after a failed attempt in Hollywood to search for employment as an animator for his own series of cartoons. Shortly after his dream fails, he moves back home only to engage in caning a paraplegic for her sexual pleasure, masturbating a horse, sucking on a cow' udder and opening the carcass of a deer only to prance around in it and use it as a fashion accessory. And that is only the first 20 minutes.       This film contains the most bizarre humour and even when it tries to develop a serious tone for the sake of progressing the ridiculous plot &#150; it cannot be. It simply is a bad film that contains the silliest climax ever. The only good thing about this film is when it ends.

Story has Tom Green as Gord Brody who dreams of being an animator but he's 28 years old and living with his parents so time is clicking. He decides to go to Los Angeles and meet television producer Dave Davidson (Anthony Michael Hall) and try and show him his drawings. Davidson doesn't like them so Gord goes back home and try and get a regular job. He meets Betty (Marisa Coughlan) who is a nurse and handicapped and he starts to date her. His father Jim (Rip Torn) is sick of his son not growing up and getting a decent job like his brother Freddy (Eddie Kaye) who works in a bank. They fight and argue and Gord lies to both his parents and Betty about having a job until he tries again with Davidson and after a big fight in his office with his father, Davidson gives him a million dollars to produce a cartoon with his drawings. This wretched film doesn't have one chuckle in it. During which scenes did Green expect us to laugh? When the little boy keeps getting his face smashed to a bloody pulp? When Gord gets turned on from an excited horse and he grabs hold of the horse's penis? When Gord takes a new born baby and swings it around his head by the umbilical cord? And afterword when he eats the cord? If your going to have gross humor in films at least have a reason for it like American Pie or Animal House. Green directed and wrote this abomination and he makes his own character so stupid and obnoxious that you don't care what happens to him. Did anyone feel better when Hall's character wrote him a million dollar check? I felt like he's an idiot giving that money to a bigger idiot and then we watched him spend it on totally inane things. Torn's character is this unsympathetic father but could you blame him? Green was so over the top idiotic that its a miracle that Gord wasn't committed to an insane asylum.

FGF is, first and foremost, a vomitorium of debauchery, and any attempt to inject a coming-of-age interpretation into any discussion of it can cause no other response than incredulity.FGF is billed as a comedy yet made me laugh only one (1) time.  To spare everyone the cost of a rental, let me spoil the joke  a comedy is in desperate trouble when a cameo by Shaquille O'Neal is its sole highlight. (And yeah, the title is funny until one realizes that it was chosen only because it's funny, therefore rendering it unfunny.)  On the other hand, I was on the verge of tears at least twice, and those weren't tears of joy. I almost wept for everyone whose resume is tainted with this filth, for Julie Hagerty's career, for the millions wasted with nothing to show for it, and for the embarrassment of an industry who produced this trash.Now, although I prefer independent cinema to the usual Hollywood crap, I'm no film snob.  Even though I'm no fan of gross-out humor for its own sake, I find movies of this type done with finesse enjoyable.  Kingpin, Return of the Living Dead, South Park, Dead Alive and Ravenous get nothing but praise from me.  All these movies possess a style that Tom Green cannot possibly understand or emulate.In all honesty I must admit that I have never liked Tom Green.  His MTV show was as stunningly unfunny as Road Trip was.  But I came to FGF with an open mind, hoping to be converted into a fan (I've always loved The Kids in the Hall and Canadian humor in general).  But if I was more of a hero I'd race into all my local independent videostores and snatch FGF out of all unsuspecting or curious renters' hands and replace it with other comedies on the New Release shelf that actually are funny (Best in Show comes to mind). I mean, we all gotta do our part to keep America beautiful, no?

Months ago I wrote a review for Cats and Dogs The Revenge Of Kitty Galore. I declared it to be the worst movie of all time. But now, I have seen something that is even 100 times worse. It actually traumatized me. I had to speak to a friend on the phone in order to calm me down and keep me from killing myself. It was that bad. So bad I kept crying and threw the VHS tape of this film I bought at the flea market in the garbage. I have never done that in my life before.The Director/Actor of this movie, Tom Green, should be killed. I sound like lots of Friedberg/Seltzer Haters while I am writing, but now I know why people hate them and Tom Green. I never wanted this to happen to me. I thought it would get better and I kept watching. It never got better. It was The Devil's Movie.Freddy Got Fingered. Why was this movie even made? To show that Tom Green can be extremely frightening and unfunny? To show that Rip Torn looks like a pedophile? To show that constant abuse of children was hilarious? No. It was made because it was. There was no point in making this movie.There is no plot. It is a bunch of sketches of Tom Green and Rip Torn screaming which becomes very frightening. But not only that, but it is an exercise in offending everyone ever.Here are 10 things that happen in the movie that are not funny 1. Tom Green Skins a deer and wears it with a huge amount of blood on it and gets hit by a truck. Animal Abuse is not funny.2. Tom Green starts licking a bloody wound from his friend after he falls on some nails. ITS DISGUSTING! 3. Rip Torn tries to kill Tom Green's Friend and acts like a psychopath the whole entire time. We feel extremely uncomfortable all the time around him.4. Tom Green bites an umbilical cord of a baby and swings the unconscious body around by the cord as blood spills everywhere and the baby is miraculously conscious again.5. Tom Green starts whacking a stick on the legs of his Nymphomaniac Handicapped Girlfriend for pleasure. This makes no logical sense whatsoever. Shouldn't that be extremely painful if you were not handicapped?! 6. Tom Green whacks off a horse as he says LOOK DADDY! I AM A FARMER! How is this funny in any way?! There is no punch lines at all! 7. Tom Green makes up lies that his Father molested his younger brother Freddy (Who is about 23) and screams so much that I and the audience become scared.8. A Kid gets hurt in many ways that could kill him. He even at the end runs into a propeller of an airplane. CHILD ABUSE = NOT FUNNY 9. Tom Green sprays Elephant Semen on his Father in India. Again. NO PUNCHLINES! 10. Tom Green gets crazy when a guy asks for more cheese at a cheese sandwich shop putting ridiculous amounts of cheese and screaming at him. WHAT.... I.... AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGH! There is no punch lines in these jokes! You can't even call them jokes because they are excessively violent and gross. Scary Movie and American Pie worked as Gross Out Comedies because they had some sort of structure to them! This doesn't! It goes way to far and people will have to go to therapy which I will be doing after they see this film.Some people like this film. Why? Because they think its art. OK. How is this art? These Are Sketches. Art is something like The Wizard of Oz because it is metaphorical and deep! Art is Lawrence Of Arabia because it is about the characteristics of man! This is just a huge pile of trite that should not be seen by anyone because no f@#$s were given into this movie and it made me extremely frustrated, angry, furious and sad at the same time.Do not watch this film. AT LEAST WITH CATS AND DOGS 2. YES. At least with Cats and Dogs 2. It was a cliché. The movie is a cliché which helps because it borrows from other films and elements to make a structure! Tom Green must die for making this film. It is the worst movie of all time. I am not even going to give it a single digit number out of 100. I am just going to give it a zero because they gave zero effort into this film.0/100 If you dare to watch this, you will be traumatized. Watch at your own risk.

Tom Green clearly set the bar as low as he could for his first studio directing film and it seems his mission was to not only push the boundaries of bad taste, but pummel those boundaries. On that criteria, Freddy Got Fingered is an unforgettable success. There's not much of a plot to speak of, just a mostly loose or disconnected series of episodic scenes involving some sort of bizarre behavior with the obnoxiousness cranked up to an 11. I can't say I've ever seen or was expecting a horse randomly being jacked off or an elephant being jacked off and ejaculating all over Rip Torn, so for all of this film's faults, being predictable isn't one of them. I would loved to have seen Fox executives' faces while viewing dailies and how this survived the test screening process, went into wide release and was screened for critics (if any film should have had no press screenings for review, it's this) is one giant mystery.

Watching it for 15 minutes it is easy to see why it has garnered so much hate. Everything in this film is in plain view and completely obvious, there are no subtleties or hidden meanings/context embedded within it; even implying so would be an insult to much better comedies that respect their audience. Freddy Got Fingered cannot even do that.The film is comparable to the kind of crude jokes a five year old would offer their friends (toilet humour), yet there is more insight to be gained from a toddler than what Tom Green shows us here. Alas this statement cannot describe how awful this film is, so unfortunately it falls upon me to elaborate, (oh how I wish this was not the case) upon the film. So many of the excruciatingly painful (allegedly) comedic set pieces demand scrutiny, but naming just one of these you will get the picture and the point of it &#x96; there is none. It exists solely to steal your money and is the most cynical piece of film making I have ever had the misfortune to befall upon.The road kill sequence is a stand out for the film. I do not mean it stands out as a highlight as would normally be implied &#x96; oh boy no, it stands out as the most unfunny, crude, repulsive, disgusting and cringe worthy sketch I have seen. It stands out as one of the sole low points. The film involves Gord Brody, who wants to become a comic book artist. He starts making drawings of a cat that has superpowers; he shows them to the person he looks up to in the industry. Who gives Brody some advice that he takes a little too literally &#x96; you have to get inside the animal. Brody then drives down the road finds road kill, cuts it open with a knife, immerses himself inside of it and dances around like a mad man. You don't have to be a scientist to work out this is not funny. Anyone who laughs in this sequence I would advise to stay the hell away from. I can only stare at the screen in antagonising pain at how this scene was ever allowed to be in a film, and surely the people who made it didn't think it was funny? Oh, I don't think they care.Unfortunately, for the viewer, the whole film is filled with sequences like this &#x96; with no meaning and a lack of laughs. Rip Torn is present, so does he redeem the whole affair? I doubt that the likes of DiCaprio, could stop this sinking headfirst into the mud. My only explanation as to why Torn is here is that the studio made him an offer he couldn't refuse.The absurd thing is that films that are not classified as comedies are funnier than this sad excuse for film making and they barely try. At every turn Freddy Got Fingered is irrepressibly bad. Avoid this like the plague, unless you want to know how it feels to be depressed for a very long time. It is nothing but shock humour; it attempts to get laughs by shocking the audience with its crudeness and vileness. This is exactly what film was never intended for.

It was god-awful, nasty and just not the least bit funny. In Freddy Got Fingered Tom Green pretty much decides that he can be MUCH more obnoxious, crass and unfunny...and he actually succeeds.The plot is supposedly about a super-stupid, vulgar and gross guy who wants to move out of his parents' basement and have his comic strip published. However, rarely does the film actually stick with this threadbare plot and mostly it consists of Green being super- stupid, vulgar and gross...but never funny. If you see this film, you'll get the magnificent opportunity to see his character deliver a baby and then bite off the umbilical cord, play with a horse's penis, watch horses have intercourse, accuse his father of sexual abuse just for laughs, lick the exposed bone on a friend's compound fracture, beat a disabled woman with a cane and much, much more. The problem with all this isn't just that it's unfunny and gross but there is no attempt to make the character likable, have a soul or a conscience or even make any sense. No human being acts like this...ever. As a result, the film is almost 100% random and Green just goes from one stupid situation after another where he often hurts those around him because his character simply has no regard for anyone. It's just a long, meaningless and self-indulgent film. Most 8 year-olds could probably make a better film...but that really isn't saying much!Now please understand...I can enjoy a comedy based on a really stupid character or set of characters. Talladega Nights, Strange Brew, Waterboy and other dumb comedies can be very, very funny. So it's not that I am expecting a film to be a work of genius to be worth seeing. One of the worst comedies I've ever seen and it truly made me hate everything about Green...everything. I also have serious worries about anyone who actually enjoys this sort of brainless and nasty mess...since it apparently tells us that child sexual abuse and animal molestation is supposed to be funny.

When his parents demand he leave, he begins to spread rumors that his father is sexually abusing Freddy.When it came out in 2001, Freddy Got Fingered was universally panned by the critics, with many saying that it's one of the worst movies ever made. Over the years, it has somehow begun to receive more positive praise. I don't see how it managed to get that, as I just watched this movie, and it was absolutely horrendous. Freddy Got Fingered is a disgusting movie without a single ounce of hilarity and without a single good gag. Most the gags rely on gross-out humor and the like (which I usually have nothing against), but in this movie, there was just way too much of it. Among them include a guy breaking his leg on a skateboard ramp (and it's very graphic by the way), Tom Green swinging a baby around in a hospital, not to mention Tom Green spraying his father with elephant semen. However, a lot of this is relatively minor compared to some of the worse things in the movie, although I won't name any of them. Why? Because it really is that disgusting and vile. Seriously Mr. Green, what it heaven's name were you thinking when you made this picture? Tom Green plays Gord Brody, a man who moves back in with his parents to become a cartoonist. Rip Torn (who I can't even begin to think of why he agreed to this movie) plays Gord's father, who constantly insults and belittles him. By the way, on a side note, I was actually on Jim's side a couple of times, Gord's drawings were awful. One another side note, there is a scene involving the following, see if you can make any sense out of it Gord plays an organ poorly while eating sausage and saying Daddy would you like some sausage? That scene was pointless. I guess that they decided to throw it in after a lot of gruesome scenes to give us a break, but it didn't help much, as we were already so grossed out by what we had seen, that this wouldn't do any better. Another message to Tom Green Just because you can direct a movie, write the screenplay for a movie, and star in a movie doesn't necessarily mean that you should.All in all, don't believe the positive things that you may have heard, this movie is still an absolutely disgusting and unfunny movie that is totally and completely devoid of laughs. What possessed Tom Green to think that this was a plausible idea for a movie? I have absolutely no clue, but I will say this, it flat out sucks. I believe that it is safe to say that we all got the middle finger from this movie, meaning that we had to endure a lot of gross out humor that wasn't funny. Although I could have just turned it off, I wanted to see where it would go, hoping that it would get better, but unfortunately, it didn't. In short, Freddy Got Fingered is definitely not a movie to watch if you want to watch something funny. You are better off watching some classic comedy, like Abbott and Costello or The Three Stooges.

Green's surrealist take on humor, using awkwardness and being frustratingly obnoxious has always struck me as desperate and this movie is no different.

There is no build to any scene, no narrative flow from one scene to another. The whole thing comes off as a random series of visual gags loosely based around a sick, semi-autistic manchild and his warped view of the world. However if you turn off the rational and moral parts of your psyche, taking in the stream of consciousness lunacy as it comes, you might find yourself laughing.     Referring to Tom Green as an artist on par with Salvador Dali or Luis Banouel might be a huge stretch. He was not intending to be a surreal artist. If you listen to the DVD commentary, it is clear that he just put together a deliberately stupid movie with elements based on his television show, his real life, and his bizarre sense of humor. Mr. Green is not even smart enough to be pretentious and that is part of what makes this film so great (so to speak.) The end product is a personal comic vision not unlike Andy Kaufmann reading the entirety of  The Great Gatsby onstage. This is art in _that_ sense, in the personal integrity sense, as a few other critics have pointed out. He is doing stuff that he finds amusing and doesn't give a s*** what you think.   But does it all work? Is it funny? Depends on your sense of humor. Many of the gags would have faired better in my view had they some kind of build. Yet giving the movie any kind of routine structure would have spoiled the chaotic lunacy and would have made it just another young adult gross out comedy. We need something like this to balance out the endlessly calculated likes of Tomcats and Scary Movie 2.  If Tom Green decides to do another film, I hope that he works his ideas into a coherent narrative in order to bring out more of the humor in them.

I do not approve of the title though, as you cannot mention it in public without being given strange looks.In the end however, it unfolded itself to be quite a nice film about acceptance. Also, the Raspberry awards for worst actor e.t.c were completely unnecessary because they were just trying to find a film to hate that year. I thoroughly enjoyed the film, and I hope folks will stop copying the critics and actually make time to watch and understand this comic, uber- surreal gem of a film.Final Verdict  Not quite Airplane or Dumb and Dumber standards, but the place after these two. 10/ 10!

The first of these was Freddy Got Fingered written and directed by MTV wacko Tom Green. Michael Rechtshaffen of the Hollywood Reporter wrote that it has the dubious distinction of being quite possibly the worst comedy ever made. Gene Seymour of the Los Angeles Times called it an airless vacuum while Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly declared it to be a disaster. The other film contending for the worst of the worst is Say It Isn't So, inexplicably starring Heather Graham, Chris Klein, and Sally Fields (how much did they pay HER to be in this movie?) This film, written by the Swallow brothers and directed by the Farrelly brothers was declared quite possibly the worst comedy of all time  by Roger Ebert. Maitland McDonagh of TV Guide called it a bucket full of sludge and Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly characterized it as vicarious serial punishment. Both of these films have been identified as possibly the worst comedies ever made. But the reviews making these allegations have to be taken in their chronological context, for none of them actually compared and contrasted the two films in question. So, the issue remains, which one of these films is actually the worst comedy ever made? Freddy Got Fingered is by far the more bizarre of the two. Tom Green has taken off-the-wall antics to a new extreme, and mixed that with completely inexplicable gross-out humor. His character is somewhere between avant-garde, disgusting, and brilliant wrapped in a thick blanket of stupidity. Freddy Got Fingered is not just a wacky gross-out comedy but also an absurd satire on the entire comedy genre, as if The Marx Brothers had done a feature length version Un Chien Andalou. Just the fact that some producer at some studio ALLOWED Tom Green to make this film is absolutely extraordinary. It's so bad it's almost good. Say It Isn't So is yet another stupid tasteless Farelly Brothers comedy where most of the humor lies on the premise that nothing is sacred. This film is entirely powered by taboo subjects such as incest, as well as poking fun at stroke victims and legless cripples. But Say It Isn't So is a film that has no higher cause or purpose. This is not a satire of itself or it's genre. Unlike Freddy Got Fingered, it aspires to be nothing more than a sick comedy. And while Freddy Got Fingered feeds off the energetic absurdist stupidity of Tom Green and the rough cynicism of Rip Torn, Say It Isn't So is mercilessly dragged along by an uninspired cast who probably regret taking the job. While both of these films may be difficult to watch, particularly for art house film snobs, Say It Isn't So is clearly the worst comedy ever made. While Freddy Got Fingered may be excruciatingly painful, it somehow manages to become absurdist art. Say It Isn't So, on the other hand, achieves nothing but tiresome schlock. Whereas the world might be a better place without Say It Isn't So, there may actually be some social and cultural value in Freddy Got Fingered. It offers hope that young people today will embrace the absurdity that defines our everyday lives, and teaches the importance of satire and irreverence in an open democratic society. Further, Tom Green's incongruous oeuvre encourages the young people flocking to his films to look beyond the snobbish European art house cinema to appreciate a home grown art form nourished on it's own excrement. Freddy Got Fingered, though tasteless and stupid, is an artistic work of unparalleled courage.

IT IS NOT A COMEDY!  DO NOT GO TO THIS FILM EXPECTING TO LAUGH!  Freddy Got Fingered is a severely disturbing satire of the common cliches of modern comedy.What Green succeeds at doing with this film is reveal the ugliness, violence, sexism, and hypocrisy that lies behind such comic films as Happy Gilmore, Joe Dirt, Road Trip, and any of the other films that have been released in the same grain.  As with all of these films, the main character is acceptable to the audience, though not to those in the film world.  The audience relates to and understands the character, and eventually the other film characters do also.  The final cliche is always We love you Joe Dirt, Happy Gilmore, Little Tramp.Green's character is so utterly confusing and disturbing that it is impossible to understand him.  You hate him by the end of the movie, and walk out speaking just like all of those villainous characters from the cliched comedies.  Lovable Loser comedies always have the moral of acceptance of all others, yet we will not accept Tom Green?In addition, the film reveals the gruesome violence behind comedy, stemming back to the Three Stooges.  The violence in comedies is humorous and without true effect or pain.  A character will fall down a flight of stairs, crack a witty joke, and walk it off.  Not in this film.  Characters who get injured, get injured gruesomely.  Violence does have consequences, and Freddy Got Fingered forces those consequences into your face.Most importantly, the viewer must realize that this film is not a joke to be laughed at.  The joke is on them.  I find that Tom Green is very similar to Andy Kaufman in the fact that he is a performance artist, not a comedian.If you choose to attend this film, prepare to be disturbed.  However, if you keep a strong, analytical mindset, you can find that the viewing experience will be remarkably rewarding.Drew Eisenstein "}{"Title":"Hilariously, crappy movie with tons of gems","Date":"29 January 2015","Score":"4 out of 8 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy","Review":" If you can't stand Tom Green, don't watch the movie.

If you enjoy some sick humor, odd/uncomfortable situations and cheap special effects, this movie might be for you. Any movie critic that blatantly bashes this movie, should seriously consider a different job. It only means that you're a simpleton who lacks the ability to enjoy films that differ in odd ways you might not be able to grasp. Perhaps your egocentric personality is blocking your way? This movie is definitely much better than the majority of all the cookie cut, cliché movies that comes spewing out of Hollywood, with huge budgets, lots of special effects, cheesy lines, thin story lines that anyone with half a brain can guess the plot while watching without much effort.Sure, this move is cheap and embarrassing at times, and that's part of its charm. It's definitely no Oscar material for best movie, actor etc. But that's not what I'd ever expect from a movie like this. It takes skills to put aside your normal high quality expectations and enjoy a movie for its quirkiness and uncomfortable, crude, sexual and bizarre humor.

I consider him to be one of the few comedians today whose work transcends comedy. I think people don't understand his aesthetic. It's not REALLY about specific gross-out jokes... it's all a social commentary about the society that has created a young man who absolutely refuses to conform to any social (or comedic) conventions or expectations. I highly recommend the movie. I believe he will be more and more appreciated through time... simply because HE'S NOT REALLY A COMEDIAN. His jokes and sequences are NOT INTENDED TO EVOKE LAUGHS, RATHER THEY ARE INTENDED TO EVOKE PUZZLEMENT AND DISCOMFORT WITH NON-CONFORMITY. Green's non-conformity is present in both the form and content of his work. The entire form of the movie is commentary on narrative conventions. The content is a commentary on the life of an individual who rejects societal convention. It's a very well balanced work of art. Look, he's not a genius or anything like that... but he's definitely misrepresented by the entertainment industry and completely misunderstood. I consider him to be more of a performance artist than a comedian. He's more like Andy Kaufman than most people realize. I consider Green to be follower of Artaud, Tzara, Breton, Cocteau, Harpo Marx, Bunuel, Allen Ginsberg as well as The Three Stooges, Pigpen, Jughead, Animal (from the Muppets), Andy Kaufman, and Cosmo Kramer.Using offensive and childish antics are merely Green's mode of puzzling and offending his audience. But the purpose of his work is not to gross people out or make them laugh (although such responses will certainly occur). Green's purpose is like the purpose of any other artist to make his audience reflect upon the nature of life. 10/10  "},{"Title":"hysterical got love the green thats going to bring in the green","Date":"20 April 2001","Score":"4 out of 8 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy","Review":"  If movies like hannibal were excepted, scary movie had no trouble, and everybody loved me myself and Irene, why are people freaking out over Freddy Got Fingered.

I've seen a few episodes and find most of the gags and lunacy toward the conservative stone-expression public to be hilarious.  I had heard about the film but put off seeing it in theatres.  I bought it used on DVD because of the show and a curiosity after all the publicity I heard.All I have to say is that I laughed the whole way through, whereas the three people who watched the film with me only elicited groans and a desire for me to turn it off.  I am a huge fan of foreign cinema and my comedic tastes wane a broad spectrum.  Most Hollywood comedies bore me with the same tired clichés and too-witty-for-their-own-good punch lines.  Finally I get a refreshing break with something that is apparently an individual vision. Tom Green is the main star, director and has a hand at the writing of this obscure gem.I can completely understand why the critics hated this film.  It doesn't follow the tried-tested-and-true formula of most mainstream comedies. Instead, Tom Green stays faithful to his personality from what I've seen of him on the show and expands it to a feature film.  I am not saying that it isn't so called stupid or poorly made; I'm just saying that I really enjoyed it and I'm not afraid to admit it.  I doubt Mr. Green really cares what the critics say anyway, after showing up to receive the Razzie and having some quotes from the worst reviews printed on the liner notes of the DVD.It has appeal, it is spontaneous, exciting and it really did tickle my funny bone.  Maybe I have a sick sense of humour, as the people who watched the film with me couldn't stand it.  I was the only one laughing.  Maybe that says something about me.Anyhow, kudos to Tom Green for giving a middle finger to the critics and Hollywood practises and for standing up, not caring what everyone else wants; just going for the independent vision.I won't state all the details of the plot since most of the reviews here already have.  I'll just say that you should see this with an open mind and it might just surprise you in some way.Don't listen to authorities and idiotic critics and try something different for a change.  Sorry to all the folks that went to see a film with a name like Freddie Got Fingered written, directed and starring Tom Green, expecting to find high brow comedy you can chuckle through your nose at.

He has created a movie to annoy and gross-out the audience.Tom Greene plays Gord Brody, a 28 year-old unemployed aspiring animator that lives in the basement of his parent's house.  Gord's father, Jim, played by long-time great character actor Rip Torn, is going crazy because Gord does not have a job and won't move out.  For some strange reason, Gord accuses Jim of sexually molesting his younger brother, 25 year-old Freddy, hence the name Freddy Got Fingered.  And for some strange reason, the psychologists and the police actually believe him, so they take Freddy away to a hospital for sexual abuse children.  Sound pretty stupid?  It is.Melissa Coughlan is terrific as Betty, Gord's girlfriend.  I think Betty was the best character of the movie.  She is a paraplegic that is unexpected funny.  While the rest of the cast had straight-man roles next to Tom Greene, Coughlan's Betty actually had Gord in some uncomfortable situations. It was a pleasant surprise to see the tables turned on Tom Greene.I do have to applaud the sheer insaneness of some of the scenes.  Tom Greene reminds me of the late Andy Kaufman at times.  You could also draw comparisons to Monty Python.  I could not keep from laughing at things you should not laugh at.  The humor is crude and offensive.

What is there to say about Freddy Got Fingered, the latest offering by our strange Canadian friend, Tom Green.  It's vulgar, offensive, brutal to the senses, shocking, thought provoking and most importantly, one OF THE FUNNIEST films I have ever seen in my life!!!  The movie stars, of course, Tom Green as Gordon Brody.  Gordon is a 28 year old guy who dreams of being an animator, although his characters are shall we say, a little unusual. As the movie starts, Gordon is finally, to the thinly masked delight of his father Jim (played snarlingly by Rip Torn), leaving home, saying that he plans to work in a Cheese Sandwich company in Los Angeles.  However that's just an excuse to persue his dream of cartoon animation.  As the movie progresses, it's classic Tom Green zaniness.  The Scuba Gear scene had me in tears, I was laughing so hard.  Along the way, Gordon has many adventures.  Meeting the girl of his dreams (who just happens to be a rocket fanatic in a wheelchair), delivering a baby (complete with a unique way of severing the umbilical cord), Having security guards sicced on him by Cameo Appearance Of The Year, real-life wife Drew Barrymore, and inadvertantly breaking best pal Harland Williams' leg.  This is an excellent movie.  It shouldn't have been.  It should be taken with a grain of salt, because, despite its many offensive moments (the I'm a farmer scene), it has many zany off the wall perfomances, one of the most notable being that of Eddie Kaye Thomas, who plays Gordon's younger brother, Freddy.  You may remember him as the guy who, did Stifler's mom from American Pie. Anyways, friends, the point is see this movie.  It was written better than this review, I'll give you that.  See this movie, or I'll be under your bed tonight, and I'll bring X-Ray Cat and a bag of buffalo eyes with me!

And Tom Green *is* a genius.  How so, you ask?  Tom Green made exactly the movie Tom Green wanted to make.  He got a substantial amount of money from a studio to make a film, created exactly his vision and had the studio aggressively promote and subsequently release it upon the world.  (Probably not by coincidence a similar situation befalls Tom's character, Gord, in the final act of the film).Unfortunately for Tom Green, the world was not ready for him.  But look back on this movie in 10 years (hell, 5 years at the rate we're going) and you will see he was way ahead of the game.  This is the future people, like it or not.  Somewhere Andy Kaufman is smiling.A surreal comedy full of unsympathetic characters and disturbing situations - even I, a die-hard Tom Green fan (and by no means easily offended), left the theatre feeling like I had been hit with a baseball bat (although admittedly I was laughing a lot at certain points in the movie).  I just pray Tom can get away with making more movies - I believe that if he tones it down a bit (especially the animal stuff, which he always has had an affinity for) then he could have a long and fruitful film career.  However, if wants to continue in this direction his film career will be over very soon, and he'll have to wait 10 years for a sizeable audience to truly be able to appreciate his work.

But as I enjoy watching the Tom Green show, then it didn't feel like a waste of money to see this one. The movie is ok, it has some funny scenes too.

I don't believe that Tom Green's humor is for everyone, as humour is the most subjective topic film goers discuss. However, I am also convinced that many of the reviews on this film were based only on individual P.O.V's, and certainly lacked any hint of objectivity, which us 'ignorant' movie watchers need from the all knowing critics. I absolutely loved this film. I loved it for one reason. Because Tom Green isn't acting, he's genuinely funny, though periodically in a different time zone altogether. There are three instances in this movie which demonstrate Green's uncanny ability to gross us humans to the brink of nausea, which consequently turned most of his adult viewers right off. I myself, would have preferred Green to omit these scenes as I found them neither interesting nor funny. Yet I wasn't bothered by them either, which separates my viewership from the majority. The movie DOES have a storyline, and it does make sense in a comical format. I recently watched Canada's #1 Comedy...Bridget Jones' Diary. I enjoyed this film as well, but certainly not for it's humour. Bridget Jones' is a snickering comedy, whereas 'Freddy' was outlandish. I think we need to loosen up and accept that comedy comes from different angles, not just one straight line everytime. Don't be influenced by others, go see this movie for yourself. You decide whether Green earns your laugh, don't let others tell you what TRUE COMEDY IS!

Tom Green will do it, and he will do it in an extreme manner.  I have been watching Tom since he was walking the streets of Toronto with his Camcorder... and I have to say not all of his work is funny... but Tom had a dream; to break all the rules of normalcy, and make HIS movie in Hollywood - and he did it!  He didn't back down when people thought he was an idiot, he went to the beat of his own drum.

The only funny parts was the abuse his neighbor's kid took, and the episodes of clean humour in the movie (The Backwards Man skit was the best in my view, but the Daddy, would you like some sausage part was rather a disappointment). What also wasn't funny was that I had to drag my mom along to see it, since I am not 18 yet.Tom Green, you forgot that there is a fine line in comedy between humourous stuff that can make us laugh our *ss off, and obscene, incredibly sickening material that happens when you take that humour and expand on it in the wrong direction. Your movie went in the wrong direction. Personally, I almost felt like leaving the movie after the first twenty minutes because it became too extreme. Tom, you should have made your humour applicable to teens of all kinds, but you only made it applicable to the sick-minded.What would've been better about this movie? Here's a rundown on what would've made it better 1) Tom not directing this cr*p, 2) Tom not co-writing this cr*p, 3) Getting rid of all the gross scenes as mentioned in the non-funny things list above, and 4) Getting rid of the plot. Tom's act is heavily worsened if it has a plot to it.So, to summarize, Freddy Got Fingered was a waste of my time and money. Tom's act is better suited for TV. What he did on TV was funny. This movie wasn't funny at all, like I said. This movie should be a sure-fire candidate for a lot of Razzie Awards in the future. No mistake about it.

He struggles with acceptance from his father and he is discouraged that he will never become an animator that makes money.

I COULD NOT TOLERATE HIM FOR 2 HOURS. MAYBE ONLY 30 MINUTES OF HIS SHOW. I WOULD PREFER YOU TO JUST STICK WITH THE SHOW OR SEE HIS SMALL BUT HUMOUROUS ROLE IN ROAD TRIP. FOR ANYONE WHO WANTS TO BE BRAVE AND TAKE ON A MOVIE THAT TOOK SICK HUMOUR TO GREAT LENGTHS, I WISH YOU LUCK. BUT THE OTHER PERCENT CAN JUST STAY AWAY FROM THIS MOVIE.

(This review discusses the themes of the movie you might think that some of them are spoilers, I suggest everyone see this movie first as it will certainly spark a reaction, good or bad, and any reaction even extreme disgust should be worth the price of admission) This was a hilariously funny movie. Admittedly I think that Tom Green is a very funny guy, I like his show and think that he does not get the credit that he deserves. I think that Tom Green will be spoken of in the same sentence as the great(he is not really dead) Andy Kaufman. But that is not what this movie is about, it is not just a ton of short scenes of Tom Green style observational humor. This is a movie that addresses Tom's very real issues with his Dad and his successes and failures. If you read an interview with Tom Green about this movie he is very serious about it. It seems to me that this is a movie about what Tom, and his friends, thought the perfect life would be like you would be able to follow your dreams, you would have the perfect girl friend(inspirational if a little over enthusiastic) And you would be able to make all of your family problems better. In the tradition of Something about Mary, there are many parts of this movie THAT ARE NOT PLAYED FOR LAUGHS, you might have to think to enjoy this movie. So go to the movie for the shock value, and it WILL shock you, but appreciate the real emotions behind the outrageousness  "},{"Title":"Freddy Got Me Smiling","Date":"20 April 2001","Score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy","Review":"  OK, since every uptight, snooty, hypocrite critic is bashing this movie let me do it the justice by saying that Freddy is Fabulous. Tom Green plays Gord; he's an aspiring animator that also has a big hobbie for skatebording. The movie follows Gord through his attempts to break into the animation world and find love, while finding acceptance in his brutal father and raising havoc to be the Tom Green we all adore. Not only does Tom Green do an excellent job of balancing the plot with some of the most absurd and gross antics I've ever seen, but does an excellent job with the directing and editing of this film. The plot's pacing and use of angles with the camera were genius. Although the films antics were extremely gross they were not sexually offensive to the point of pornography as in Scary Movie or American Pie. It's all good gross fun along with an deeper message of the pursuit of happiness for everyone. No matter how strange Green may seem to we who don't masturbate animals, we all have our own little quirks in life that sometimes allow us to question our potential.

I'd first off say that I loved this film! Sure, there are a few discontinuity errors, the film's plot hardly hasn't anything to do with the title and the characters are dumb fun, but who cares! It's Tom Green for f8#% sake! Material like this I'd say would align perfectly with other mindless fun such as Jackass or even American Pie. It's not supposed to be the most well-made, r award winning piece ever. Here's why I think this film is so great (also why I think Tom Green should have made more films like this afterwards as well as this film not getting the total credit it deserves).The film mindlessly contradicts itself back and fourth. We have so much happening in here which consists of sexualisation on animals, pregnancies, cheese sandwiches, cartoon drawings, music fused with food and angry fathers who are accused of molesting their sons. It's never ending in this twisted fun! I had a lot of fun as I found many great moments in the story. Some include when he pretends he's an underwater diver, when he crosses his fingers, when he rides the skateboard. Even the restaurant scene is priceless! Tom Green professionally went out and did something he wanted to do. If people take this film too seriously and decide that it's too shocking or gross for their taste, then they're not going have fun with it. Sure, we can't see everything we like. I sure didn't like every scene in the film, but for the most part it kept me intrigued.As I mentioned at the top, I really wished Tom Green could've made more sickly (gooping) comedies like this after Freddy Got Fingered Overall, I enjoyed the film's acting, tenacity, majority of scenes and explicit crude humor which Green dished out left, right and centre. This film should have received more recognition for these factors. My verdict, see it - 8/10 "},{"Title":"Delivers its shocks, which I'm sure was intentional, but with no laughs, shock humour can be atrocious!","Date":"24 June 2008","Score":"1 out of 3 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy","Review":" The other day, when I rented the 1943 version of The Phantom of the Opera, along with this film, co-written, directed by, and starring Tom Green, a guy behind the counter at the video store laughed and said, What a combo! Even though I had never seen Freddy Got Fingered before, and had only seen a bit of Phantom of the Opera, I knew what he meant, since I don't think I have to explain how different those two films are! Anyway, before I saw this 2001 comedy, I knew to expect shock value and probably a lot of immaturity as well, which wouldn't have been a bad thing if it were actually funny, but it's not. In fact, sometimes, it's actually quite repulsive! Gord Brody is a 28 year old goof-ball who lives with his parents in Portland, Oregon, but his ambition is to become an animator. He leaves home and drives down south, hoping to be able to sell his cartoon ideas to Hollywood. Sadly, it doesn't work out. He is told how stupid his ideas are and how he has to rethink them. After this, Gord soon finds himself back with his parents, unemployed, and is often mistreated by his disappointed and insensitive father, Jim. He does find himself a girlfriend named Betty, who loves being beaten on her paralyzed legs with a cane and giving oral sex, but the wannabe animator continues to have family problems. Eventually, a psychiatrist gets involved, and Gord lies to her about his father molesting Freddy, the younger brother in the family! Around the beginning, it seemed pretty much mediocre. I did sort of like the sequence with Gord skate boarding through the mall, but I think that's just because they used a Sex Pistols song for it. I still wasn't finding anything very funny, and the first really bad gag I found was when he's on his way to L.A. and enthusiastically stops at a farm to masturbate a horse! Soon after this, we see the character dancing and holding a wiener on his groin, saying, I'm a sexy boy! Ding dong! On his way back home, we see him cutting open a deer carcass on the road and wearing it! After this, the film features many more extreme gross-out gags, sometimes involving a lot of blood, such as a kid getting severely injured more than once with blood gushing from his face! I'm sorry, but scenes like that are about as funny as concentration camp footage! There are lots of other really lame jokes, such as the sexual molestation ones, and it seems to be just for the sake of shock value, without being funny at all! Another song I heard and recognized much later in the film was Moby's Natural Blues, which also fit the scene it was used for well (a melancholy scene), but a couple songs I liked obviously couldn't make the film for me.Not only have I seen this movie, I have also seen some clips from The Tom Green Show, which were lame, so I'm convinced Tom Green is one talentless hack! He is known to use crude humour and shock value, but there are plenty of others in the comedy business who like to use the same kind of humour. However, probably almost all other comedians I'm familiar with who are known to really push the envelope are more talented than Green. Since Green isn't funny, he probably has to shock in order to get attention, since it doesn't take any talent just to shock people. Watching Freddy Got Fingered was a lot like watching Borat, except I didn't laugh. I got both shocks AND laughs (often maybe both at the same time) from the controversial 2006 blockbuster, but with this 2001 Tom Green film, I just got shocks! Now, I'll admit, I did smile occasionally, which I believe is the only reason why I'm giving this movie more than a 1/10, but the smiles were rare. One of the parts where I couldn't help but smile was when a cheese sandwich customer asks Gord what he's supposed to do with all the cheese, and he answers, You could shove it up your bum-bum, but that must have been the kiddie side of me coming out! For the most part, this film is simply awful, and while Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer may do slightly worse, Green is still a major disgrace to modern comedy!

So, Gord moves back home and wreaks havoc on his family, including the accusation that his brother Freddy was fingered by his father.Many people think this film is horrible. Certainly, the Razzy Awards thought so. I, also, didn't think much of it when I first saw the movie. Tom Green is more annoying in this film than he ever was before. But the movie also grows on you, and if you can get the right mindset you might appreciate it. (Not unlike Napoleon Dynamite which is either stupid or genius based on how you approach it.) I watched this with two people (Jason and Matt) who thought it was the greatest comedy ever... I wouldn't go that far. Though, I think if it was slightly different, the same plot with the same jokes could have been hilarious. (I can't pinpoint exactly what's off) The supporting cast is helpful, with Harland Williams being funny and the best role going to Rip Torn as the father. Torn entered something of a Renaissance in the mid-2000s, which I wouldn't doubt it related in part to his work in this film. Would he have been chosen for Dodgeball? I have my doubts. Drew Barrymore is decent in her small role, and Anthony Michael Hall was excellent (and hardly recognizable to those of us who remember him from The Breakfast Club).What makes this film noteworthy is the real push into both absurdity and obscenity. Cow udders and horse penises do not usually get placed in feature films, nor do keyboards rigged to pulleyed sausages. There is something beautiful about this. While I find gross-out humor awful (this is my biggest beef with films like Van Wilder and American Pie), many like it and this film really paved the way for films that would come out after it (though was by no means the beginning of gross-out). And I can think of no film as absurd.And it just increases as the film goes on. Small jokes like the must have experience with cheese sandwiches really make me chuckle, and the big scenery change towards the end just goes over the top in a way few films, if any, have thought to do before. Tom Green is either a complete genius or mentally retarded man with very lucid dreams. I'm not sure which.Underneath it all, under the stupidity, absurdity, obscenity and poor acting... there is a message here. Something about rocket-propelled wheelchairs and shooting the moon, achieving your dreams. Maybe the presentation was a little untraditional but it works. Be prepared to give this film a second chance, it's not as bad as you remember.

I've found that the sort of people who enjoy this deranged, out of the ordinary and flat out insane movie are actually quite normal. There's a reason why Roger Ebert and every other critic panned this movie they are not normal. They do not lead a normal life. They obviously don't have to put up with the stress and absurdity that the average working man (or woman) deals with on a regular basis. Sometimes we all just need a release. A real raw, and edgy movie that makes no apologies and does not try to cover up what it is. Freddy Got Fingered is this movie. It is hardly a guilty pleasure. I don't think I could feel so guilty about loving a movie that has given me so many laughs and memorable moments. Freddy Got Fingered tells the story of Gord (Tom Green), a 28 year-old aspiring cartoonist with some crazy ideas and ways of life who still lives in his parents house and gets under the skin of his father (the brilliant Rip Torn). In his efforts to improve his cartoons to impress the head of an animation studio (Anthony Michael Hall), Gord falls in love with a crippled, rocket-scientist/nympho, accuses his dad of molesting his little brother Freddy (Eddie Kay Thomas), makes cheese sandwiches and has all kinds of other off-color, off-beat and offensive mis-adventures. For all the insanity displayed on here and all the tastelessness that this movie can withstand, at the core there is a good message, and it is quite simple. Gord isn't a bad person, he lives his life his own way, never compromising and it ends up working out for him. Sure, you may not be able to see that through all the blood, cheese and sausage on-screen, but nevertheless, a good story prevails. Tom Green does a great job all around. This is his movie, all the way. His directing (first time) is seamless, his writing is right on the mark and he truly gets inside his character. If you have the guts to check it out and aren't afraid to laugh (honestly), then you too will find something you love in Freddy Got Fingered.10/10 (and I'm serious!)

Unfortunately the scene where I laughed the hardest I interpreted wrong; in the skateboard scene I thought Brody's friend had cut himself on a nail because the skate ramp was so shoddily constructed, instead he had just mysteriously broken his leg from not even a hard landing. Marisa Coughlan delivers what must be some of the toughest lines a serious female actress has ever had to deliver. As forgettable as the film is I still find myself wanting to yell FORTY MILLION F***ING DEUTSCHMARKS!!!!! YOUR FIRED!!!!! FORTY MILLION F***ING DEUTSCHMARKS!!!!! on occasion.

After his dreams of working for studio mogul Dave Davidson (Anthony Michael Hall) temporarily wash out, along with his thankless job at a cheese factory, Gord returns home to live with his parents, Jim (Rip Torn) and Julie (Julie Hagerty). Jim wishes that Gord would simply grow up, move out of the basement, and get a real job like his younger brother Freddy (Eddie Kaye Thomas), who works in at a bank. When the battle of wills between Gord and Jim heats up, Gord devises various stunt-like schemes to drive his father bonkers, including the bogus charge that their father molested Freddy as a youngster. Freddy Got Fingered was pretty bad, Tom Green should quit making this kind of trash, but you gotta love Rip Torn though, he is cool.

It is extremely gross and shocking in parts. But aside from that, this movie is great. Tom Green shows that he is not only a comic genius, but he can direct better than most of the crappy directors making movies today. Sure, a lot of the things Tom Green does in the movie are rediculous and dont make any sense towards the plot, but the story as a whole is well written and progresses throughout well. As for the humor, I guess you would have to be more into obscure stuff than normal. The acting is also much better than average and isnt distracting.So if you like Friends and your sense of humor is dried up like a lump of dog crap, steer clear of this movie. Otherwise, you have to see this movie! It was definately better than most of the movies I saw in 2001.

All at the same time.  And, in some ways, brilliant.  This movie is funny because of how unfunny it is.  That is a rare achievement and I believe was the actual intention to begin with.This is the strangest movie I have ever seen, yet what made it so strange was the fact that no movie I have ever seen before it has ever been so successful in its ability to cross the line, then come back around and cross it again.  This is a movie for people who know how to not take anything seriously.  Everyone else is sure to be offended.  This movie was obviously not intended to be taken as serious humor, yet some people seem oblivious to this.  It was my early understanding of this fact that led me to watch it a second time with some very uptight friends.  The humor of the movie had long since worn off for me, but I could sit and watch their expression, causing me to fall out laughing all over again.  I found myself laughing and simultaneously ashamed at myself, which made me laugh even harder.  You begin laughing out of shock at some of the scenes.  Did I actually just see him get out of his car on the side of the road to give a horse a hand job?  Should I keep watching this?  The movie was not funny.  The REACTION to it is what's so funny.  Not unlike most people, I want to smack Tom Green, yet I can't help laughing.   I must confess that he has my dream job getting paid to act like a complete idiot.My favorite scene  (no, I don't recall their character's names), though indescribable, involved Tom stringing up sausages to the ceiling, tying the string to his fingers, eating the sausage, while trying to play the keyboard, while singing Daddy would you like some sausage?.  Absolutely freaking stupid.  I am sure many humorless people trying to be funny have thought up similarly stale and bizarre stunts, but how rare to see one actually act them out with such wild abandon.Spoiler Another part I was especially fond of was when Tom spends the last of his million dollars to relocate his father's house to Pakistan (all in one piece), drug him during the relocation, so that his dad finally wakes up, unaware of the relocation until he opens the front door to a desert full of roaming camel jockeys.  If you don't laugh at stupid jokes because of how stupid they are, you are not going to like this movie very much.    If you feel it is worth your time to actually analyze what made this movie bad, you are not going to like this movie (and probably need to do something more productive).

I guess it just depends on who you are.  Teens who are big fans of Tom Green will enjoy this movie, but I doubt anyone else will. Now none of the acting is good in this movie.  Seriously, all of the acting is horrid.  I think the only person with a shred of all right acting in this movie is Eddie Kaye Thomas who plays Freddy.  Tom Green isn't even really acting.  This insaneness he presents is how he acts all the time.  And Rip Torn who plays Jim the dad just got on my last nerve.  And I did like Marisa Coughlan until this movie.  She really did pick the wrong role.  Maybe she thought this would make her a bigger actress because she was alongside names like Tom Green and Rip Torn.  Sorry sweetie, it did nothing to help your acting.  It only hurt it. I did like how Drew Barrymore was in this film.  She did an excellent job being comedic without being overly raunchy.  Very nice indeed.  But she always does a good job at that.  It always amazed me how she was married to Tom Green, and it amazed me more that he divorced her.  Weird but true.  Anyway, good cameo by Ms. Barrymore.   Overall, this movie stunk.  I guess if you are high or drunk you might like this movie, or if you are a teenager.  Or maybe all of the above.

With content that includes the handicapped, the mentally ill, sexual abuse victims and animal masturbation there is certainly a large volume of material to make a truly funny movie.  Only Tom Green really is not the man for the job.Tom Green just isn't funny, this is not, I should mention, a subjective point of view.  It is a universal imperative.  Firstly he tries far too hard.  With some comedians this over zealous effort can turn into truly hysterical routines.  With Tom Green you stare at his set pieces and wait for some truly funny climax, and then it's over, and you're left with nothing.  I guess it is a little like modern impressionistic art, if as the creator you repeat something that is wacky or bad enough times and stand by it, and continue to stand by it, people, some people will start to take you seriously.  And if you get enough of the right people taking you seriously then you gain respect and credability.  This persistence is Tom Greens greatest strength, not his humour.The film is just not very clever......or irreverent, or alternative, or anything, it's just a couple of overpaid knuckleheads trying way too hard.

This has to have been one of the funniest movies that I've ever seen! Now, that isn't saying that Tom Green is a genius; in fact, it is the sheer stupidity and audacity of this film that allows it to click for me. I don't usually watch comedies to think deeply about the problems of the human existence (unless, of course, it's an exceptionally well-crafted mix of drama and comedy, such as the Michael Moore documentaries or Kubirck's Dr. Strangelove). My maxim is this if it makes me laugh, it's good enough for me. The movie doesn't even require a decent plot or even decent actors. It helps to be weird, sick, twisted, and, nonsensical. Sheer anarchy reigns in Freddy. The movie essentially takes the loser seeking to fulfil his dreams plot and twists and contorts those cliches to grotesque levels that the lame Saturday Night Live movies could never in their wildest dreams hope to accomplish. Even Amelia Bedelia-type puns are toyed with. For example, when the cartoon producer advises Green to get inside his animals, who would have expected that Green would not only get inside of a deer skin, but would have the audacity to take out a bowie knife and skin a stinking hunk of roadkill, with its guts making a sqeauling noise as they spill onto the road, all to the tune of some corny Coca-Cola ad? Yes, this is not funny, you all may say, it's sick! but I think its Greens willingness to cause the audience to wretch that's funny, rather than the sick pun itself. The beyond-belief stupidity also adds to the movie. That Gord's girlfriend's favorite hobbies include constructing rocket powered wheelchairs and flipping coffee creamers is too weird not to at least be snickered at. I must say, the romance between Gord and his girlfriend clicks they're both equally crass, moronic, and surreal. Hell, it's far more believable than the wooden romance between Darth Vader and his geisha girlfriend in that new Star Wars movie. The strange, unbelievable plot turn at the end is also so poorly-conceived, that it's funny. I'm still baffled that all throughout the movie idiocy reigned supreme, yet Green makes an obscure geography reference to the Thar Desert, which is on the India-Pakistan border. This geography reference would probably be rather obscure to most people. Hey, there's a reason to recommend Freddy learn South Asian geography! I suppose part of the reason people despised Freddy was the fact that Gord, the protagonist, was a selfish, despiciable personage, always willing to do harm to his family and friends to get what he wanted. In many of the other so-called potty humor films, the characters get into gross situations, but they always mean well and have kind hearts; there's none of that with Gord. He only cares for himself, and is willing to destroy the good name of his father and straight-laced brother to get what he most desires. Gordon Brody is definitely the devil-child that Chris Farley and Adam Sandler are not in their movies. Still, I think that Green's evil anti-hero is a breathe of fresh air to the good-guy personas we often see in these movies. This movie is no classic, but it may someday achieve some sort of cult status amongst Green fanatics and people who like totally weird movies. Freddy may have lost the battle with the critics, but it may end up winning the war with a following of Green-iacs.

It does, however, warrant at least some praise for having such perfect timing and craftsmanship for eliciting pure disgust and anguish on its viewers.At its heart, it's a test.  A test to see how much of an assault to basic taste, human dignity, or just about anything good in this world can be made before a person's stomach turns.  For me that took about 15 minutes.Challenging the boundaries of good taste is nothing new.  But while an avant-garde artist may defecate on a canvas and hang it on the wall, Tom Green would be more likely to take the feces off the wall, eat it, and then vomit it up on to his own mother.I think that explains the variety of opinions of this movie.  Either you enjoyed it for it's ability to display a perfect sort of depraved insanity that stands as an affront to any sort of coherent goodness, or you hated it because there really is no way to take pleasure in watching something like that.So I have a difficult time calling it a 'bad' movie.  It did exactly what it set out to do, and then some.  It exceeded any and all expectations regarding the subject of filth.

The closest thing this movie equates to in real terms is a road accident, and one involving liberal quantities of disabled children, puppy dogs and the ebola virus. Therefore it exerts a kind of perverse fascination over the viewer; you want to turn turn your head away from the carnage, but an inner compulsion draws you back.Tom Green doesn't really get much air time in the UK, although his exploits are pretty well documented in various magazines and so it's easy to work out that his own particular style of comedy involves little else than behaving like a complete imbecile. Why spoil a tried and tested formula, and waste a carefully honed characterisation when making that all important conversion from quickfire TV sketches to a 90 minute feature? Green does not seem to realise that the two mediums are rather different from one another, and that a succession of revolting sight gags do not entertain solely on their own merits.Don't misunderstand me. I am no stranger to bad taste, in fact it's what gets me out of bed in the mornings. Gross, trashy, sleazy, disgusting, visceral and offensive material is all we have against the commercial propeganda machine that is the mainstream media, and has the potential to be infinitely more affecting, informative and entertaining WHEN IT'S DONE WELL.

It's curious it think who Green's target demograpic was for this jejune bilge. Who, except perhaps lobotomy outpatients, could possibly want to see, or be entertained by, a grown man tossing off a horse/elephant, tongueing an open wound on someones fractured leg, gnawing through an umbilical cord (already done, my friend, by Dan Akroyd), wearing a freshly removed animal skin like a raincoat or (very dodgy, this) beating his paraplegic girlfriends legs with a stick in return for oral sex? Not to mention a few jibes at child molestation (big comedy area that, I don't know why anyone hasn't mined it before).What's amazing is the quality of the cast. Rip Torn disgraces himself thoroughly by  basically appearing in the movie, though he tries hard with the material, and agreeing to bare his arse and be basted in elephant love custard in two of the flick's most (comparatively) gratuitous moments. Eddie Kay Thomas (the weird one in the American Pie Movies) is wasted here as well. BUT, and this is the most appalling waste of all, the criminally underrated and underused Julie Hagarty, she of the 'Airplane' movies, 'What about Bob?' and 'Lost in America' appears on our screens for the first time in God knows when and it's in this dreck. It's like asking John Gielgud to participate in 'Billy Madison'.I know this was lambasted by the critics, and as someone else has mentioned, this is probably exactly what Green was aiming at a film that so sincerely and consistently strived to be the polar opposite of any definition of the words 'entertaining' or 'acceptable' that, once it's intentions were laid bare, would simply become critic proof. Negative reviews are simply water off the duck's back to the makers, but no-one should have to suffer the ordeal of wasting their precious time or money on this. I don't agree with censorship at all, nor would I want to censor this; a film this poor doesn't need any more publicity or attention paid to it, with any luck it will die a quick, lonely death, much like Tom Green's career.Excuse me, I think I hear a bus coming.

These things are funny because the humour, while non conventional, is lampooning greed ('Way Out West') and incompetence among politicians ('Dr. Strangelove'), two things everyone loves to hate so why not make a joke out of it?!  And these things are done with a thought out plan for excessive appeal.  'Freddy Got Fingered' is one man's (Green) forced obsession with gross and tasteless comedy who thinks others will find it funny.  Tom Green disgracefully shows cruelty to animals, puts inner human body parts in his mouth, splashes his father with animal sperm and as much as I am against censorship, this film should have gotten an X rating when it was released.  It is not funny for a second and I truly believe there is something wrong with the sick minds who acted in this and brought it to the screen.

Reading through the several reviews written by angry christians who apparently thought it was their duty to see this film, even though they KNEW it would offend and disgust them, I became rather infuriated and decided to voice my own opinion. Tom Green is a rather brilliant man for making Freddy Got Fingered.  I'm pretty sure he was not looking for worldwide acceptance of the film, but rather wanted to make a bunch of people angry and please those of us who are capable of individual thought. There seems to be quite a bit of obsession about the fondling of the horse and elephant phallus in this film.  Perhaps everyone who was offended by this have repressed sexual feelings geared toward such animals and are just jealous because Mr. Green is being allowed to act out their own fantasies.I really don't see what the problem with the film was.  Tom Green is a unique individual and his work should not be compared to anyone else's.  From what I've read, no one is able to identify with Tom Green and thus do not understand him.  Because people do not understand him, they feel it is necessary to make idiotic comments that they believe to be clever.  If you do not understand something, it is best to either find out what it means or just not pay any attention to it and hope that those who do will not ridicule you if you show signs of ignorance.

And that's about it.What makes this film so bad is the sheer pointlessness and lack of intelligence in its humour. Silly humour can be great - look at Monty Python's absurdist magnificence. Gross out humour can work if done properly such as South Park and Trainspotting. This however, does neither well. The story is pointless as well, all of it comes as an excuse for Tom Green to annoy the life out of everyone in his vicinity. We have a guy virtually rubbing a sandwich on his face, the same guy licking a man's broken bone, masturbating a horse, sucking a cow's udders, masturbating an elephant, swinging a phallic salami around on a sandwich production line, walking around in a deer carcass, swinging a baby round by the umbilical cord. Though I am an atheist, I am sure that baby Jesus is crying his eyes out somewhere. Green uses the sort of humour that I would've used to entertain my little cousins when I was nine. Equally unfunny comedian Chris Rock likes this film, therefore I rest my case. Having said all of this, it is hard not to laugh at Green because of the sheer insanity he portrays - though we definitely laugh AT him and not WITH him. Plus the level of sheer audacity, talentlessness, brainlessness, stupidity and wackiness is really something to behold. I suppose we should give Green the credit for having the cojones to let a building fall on top of him a la Buster Keaton, and for cr*pping on Hollywood's carpet when they thoroughly deserve it for their own frequent lack of talent and intelligence.

While there he also delivers a baby via unorthodox methods.As time goes by, Gord's father slowly gets frustrated with his son's inability to get and hold down a job and turns insane by his antics (one involving an attempt at multi-tasking and another fantasy role-play in the shower) and starts ripping apart his skateboard ramp, ironically as a result of wanting his son to be more constructive. The film is named because Gord pathologically lied to the family guidance specialist that his dad abused his brother Freddy (Eddie Kaye Thomas who doesn't play a major part in the film at all). Eventually Gord's spirit is destroyed but is restored upon knowing his girlfriend successfully created her rocket-powered wheelchair. He gets a job as an animator and spends his money on sending his house all the way to Pakistan where he and his father get captured...Oddly enough, the parts I laughed at, which were few and far between, were the less gross aspects of the film. One was at the start where Gord smacked into a 'push only' door from the inside while illegally skate-boarding and being chased by security guards. The others I smiled at was 'Backwards Man' and the 'Daddy do you want some sausage' skit.I love stupid, surreal and shocking films and found this watchable but it lacks because it had very little interesting to say even on it's own terms and found it more exploitative rather than original, creative or inspiring (Monty Python was doing this kind of thing better with more wit and effect). Gross out films have been around for years but were becoming a fad around 1999 onwards with the emergence of 'American Pie' which made me believe that 'Freddy Got Fingered' was merely jumping on the bandwagon but just tried to up the stakes.Tom Green as id-ridden Gord seems to settle for a character that wobbles between naivety and darkness but it instead comes across as just annoying making the happy ending (subversive or not) somewhat erroneous.Some people say 'the joke is on you if you don't get it' but that's like going to an art museum, seeing a painting of a couple of squares and being told you are dumb if you don't understand what the artist is saying. My interpretation of the movie is, although this is a film of contradictions, Mr Green wanted his cake and eat it. He made it to completely gross you out and then attempts to challenge the viewer's intellect by saying; 'I dare you not to love this movie. If you don't you are stupid'. Well...this kind of argument often covers transparent pretentiousness and, in this case, of a movie that seems obsessed with the masturbation and violation of animals.

What he does here doesn't disgust me, but on no occasion did I laugh during this film. He presumably expected his actions to be humorous purely because of their shock value, but the film falls way short of the mark. It is no wonder the world appears to have forgotten about him.

It's as if the negative reviewers interpret this film as a direct attack on their sensibilities. It is telling that this reaction has been generated by most comics who were later hailed as 'ahead of their time' and 'genius'. I'm not sure why people reserve their wrath for this movie and not one of the countless mediocre comedies that Hollywood churns out. At least FGF provokes a strong reaction in all who see it, instead of provoking a yawn like most of the other comedies these days.To start with, those who go into a movie like this not expecting to see any dumb, gross, offensive humor are just setting themselves up for a fall. You'd have to be totally in the dark about Tom Green to expect anything less than what he dishes out here. Most people enjoy a really dumb comedy now and then, so what's the big deal? This movie inspires side-splitting laughter in those who get it. Anyone who enjoys completely absurd situations and has a little bit of Beavis in their DNA will appreciate this. Tom Green just pushes the most ridiculous moments to the extreme, and the result is uncontrollable laughter. You have to respect a guy who is so dedicated to the craft of making people laugh that he will do literally anything for the laugh. Freddy Got Fingered proved that Green is that guy. Few comics dare to push that far and get that crazy.FGF is hysterically funny on an entirely different level as well. Part of the whole joke is the fact that Tom Green spent all that investor money on such an insane piece of work. It's just like his character in the movie- he gets a shot at the big time and uses it to realize his most twisted inside jokes. It's a big middle finger to Hollywood, on some abstract level. Also, the horribly negative reviews it gets make it even more funny. You one-star reviewers are all part of the joke. If you love impropriety, absurdity, inappropriate humor, extremism, and making fun of everything sacred, you will love this film and want to buy it. If you are stuffy, aloof, humorless, and proper, you will despise this movie. Either way, it is light years ahead of its Hollywood competition in the comedy department. Most of the comedy blockbusters of the past 10 years have been utter failures.There will never again be a movie like this, because investors will never take a chance like this again. That makes Freddy Got Fingered all the more poised to remain the funniest comedy of all time.

It is a rare film-making moment when a fringe character as absurd, juvenile, and gross as Tom Green somehow gets the doors opened and the ticket written. No doubt his marriage to one of Hollywood's favorite daughters opened some doors, but one can only assume that Green had a plan already. Freddy Got Fingered so perfectly adopts the mainstream, big budget Hollywood movie look, plot, music score, and excess that it both puts the lie to the knee-jerk arc of so-called human feelings exploited in the average drama AND pulls it off at the same time. Yes, Freddy Got Fingered is full of all the little human moments that are built into any popular Cineplex fare. Actually, even more so. It seems every five minutes there is a genuine plot point of family or relational pain, honesty, and redemption. And every other five minutes is deranged gross-out comedy -- which is all any easily-offended person will see. It's like an insane person found one of the innumerable scriptwriting books that helps you design a winning script -- and then like the proverbial 100 monkeys, successfully tapped out a deranged person's sincere attempt to follow the formula. And it works, bizarrely enough. And of course anyone with a vested interest in the Hollywood myth must hate it. (WARNING scene spoiler ahead.) After all, putting a heartfelt father-and-son reconciliation moments after the son has caused an elephant to ejaculate in his father's face is true mockery of all those indulgent resolutions. Yet it is not ironic -- one gets the clear sense that Green is truly making a personal expression of his own situation with his father and family. Finally, anyone who says the movie is simply bad is just offended. Aside from its brilliance, it is also good film-making. Green gets great articulated performances from all, especially Marisa Coughlan who is nothing short of amazing as the wheelchair-bound, fetish-loving girlfriend. Everything flows - scene transitions are particularly well-handled -- and the plot is both connected and totally fluid, just like David Mamet says it must be. Plus Green truly 'quotes' one of the great sight-gags of all time when that house falls over on him. He did his own stunt and any error would have cost him his life.

However, buried every now and then in the list is a comment that claims this film is either ahead of its time or underrated. It is comments such as these that I wish to debunk here.Quite honestly, if this is the future of comedy, then the future of the world is as bleak a place as it was a trend to depict in the Hollywood of 1980 to 1990 or thereabouts. Only it won't be because the economy is in the hole or the police have been given too much power. Like all comedies borne of political correctness, Freddy Got Fingered gives us a glimpse into a future where comedies are made by people who do not have any real sense of humour.Yes, that's right - Tom Green does not have a real sense of humour. You might think a sense of humour entails enjoying laughter, but that is only part of the deal. A real sense of humour entails knowing WHEN to laugh, too. Sure, some events in the film might seem humourous when taken on their own, the gag about a paraplegic woman who likes having her legs beaten with a bamboo stick being an example. However, when combined with spiteful, even hateful events in the film such as one brother claiming a father abuses the younger brother out of sheer malice, that's when it becomes clear that Tom Green is the pathetic kind of idiot who will laugh at anything. He'd probably laugh at a photo of himself being beaten by the LAPD if he were shown said photo under the right circumstances.While Green might feel that every moment he puts in his film hits the mark and he's just misunderstood, thankfully there is still a majority who see him for what he really is. I don't say a majority just to sink into the Might Makes Right defense, either. I say it because I want to assure the people who are as disgusted with this film as I was that the rest of the world is mostly as disgusted as you or I are. Hell, after seeing that tens of millions of dollars was spent on making this trash, I am not surprised that people in poorer countries have it in for America. You'd never see a film that is this much a waste of money being made in England or Australia.So, people, I would like you to remember something. Deriving humour from offense is a trick art, and one that is fraught with danger at the best of times. Everything that Benny Hill made is utterly dated because of how he made this kind of humour work, and even a lot of Eddie Murphy's older material is something you will never see made outside of the early 1980s, chiefly because it walks this line. FGF, on the other hand, is timeless because it goes over the line, stops being even remotely funny, and becomes utterly offensive. Some critics of this opinion claim that the people who were offended have lived a sheltered life. Well, I was abused as a child and I find this film offensive. The reality is that the only people who have lived a sheltered life are those who think this dreck is remotely funny. Not because they haven't seen the reality behind what is presented here, but because they haven't seen it close enough to realise why trying to turn it into comedy is enough to make those of us with our heads screwed on properly sick.This film gets a fat, stinking one out of ten from me. There is a good reason why Tom Green has never knowingly confronted a real victim of child abuse in the street, or gone to disrupt their support groups, during his asinine variety TV show. He is afraid of what the reaction might be. Considering that I've been to support groups for the kind of men whom childhood abuse literally turned into overgrown monsters, I am not in the slightest bit surprised. Ahead of its time? More like a product of the most evil socio-political thinking of its time.

I remember when it was first coming out my local theater didn't screen it, because the manager hated Tom Green. I was a fan of Tom Green, but I avoided this film, after seeing the onslaught of critical bashing this film received. I heard person after person bash this movie.It wasn't until one of my coworkers gave me a praise review of the movie, I realized that I am a big Tom Green fan, and he has to do very little to make me laugh. So I saw this movie for cheap on DVD, bought it, and made a deal with my friend to sell it to him if I absolutely hated this movie. I can say that my friend isn't going to get his hands on my copy anytime soon.I found this movie HILARIOUS, I was consistently laughing the whole time, and that's a big deal because it is INCREDIBLY hard to make me laugh, just ask my friends.I think it was inevitable for me to love this comedy; I seem to flock to any oddball comedy. I love stupid humor like Kung Pow Enter the Fist and Baseketball but also like more sarcastic Kevin Smith films or crazy genre spoofs like Austin Powers, Undercover Brother and Not Another Teen Movie.I'm not the type of person who even likes gross-out humor. I disliked American Pie and I think Scary Movie is one of the biggest piles of feces on the planet. But here it was funny, because it was either completely random, or it purposefully made no sense. Take the infamous scene with the horse. It just comes out of nowhere, Gord (Tom's character) is just driving down the road, sees an aroused horse, sends his car to a screeching halt, jumps the fence and starts messing with the horse, and about as quickly as the scene started, it stops and he's back on the road again. It's one of those things where you go What the !@#$ was that! and laugh.Most people complain about a bunch of stuff in this movie being gross or offensive. They whine that Tom beating the legs of a woman in a wheelchair with a bamboo stick isn't funny. I found that really funny because I got the joke, this woman is a masochist who gets sexually aroused when men spank her legs...but it makes no sense because she can't feel anything in her legs. Others whine about this movie saying that child molesting is portrayed as funny. Well, when the Institute for Molested Children (which is a joke in itself because no institute to help abused children would label themselves that blatantly) looks like an orphanage out of Annie and all the kids are wearing T-shirts with the Institute's logo, labeling them as molested children (something that would NEVER happen) it's FUNNY. Or when Gord's friend breaks his leg, and the bone is jutting out, but it looks like a blatantly fake prop, it's funny!And for all the gross stuff that people were complaining about, there was still nothing that tops the stuff in Monty Python's The Meaning of Life which has scenes in it that I can't even THINK about without dry heaving. You want to be grossed out by gross out content, see that film, want to laugh with gross-out content? See this film.The film may not seem to have a plot, well basically, it only has a plot to make fun of formulaic movie plots. It's a laugh riot when this movie mocks cliché and repetitive sentimental scenes we see in a billion movies a year, you think it's going to go one way, and then a curveball hits, Tom throws in some odd joke, which comes completely from left field.Basically to sum things up, Freddy Got Fingered is a movie that's like one of those jokes that those who get it, will love it, and those who don't get it will be stuck saying That's stupid or That's offensive. But that's basically been the case with all of Tom Green's comedy.Well I got this movie, and it's probably one of my favorite comedies, and has tripled my admiration and respect for Tom Green.

My advice to people who like ridiculous comedy such as that made by the Will Farrel, Owen Wilson, Ben Stiller group or Kevin Smith etc. and didn't like Freddy Got Fingered is to watch this movie again ignoring the graphical parts of scenes such as the hospital scene or the farm scene, and listening out for comments like I saved the day Betty, look daddy I'm a farmer, Japan 4 or I bought you jewels and you'll probably get at least a few laughs.

Green expresses himself this way, as almost a Ren and Stimpy (or Space Ghost Coast to Coast) character, in real life and on his TV show, so it is totally fitting that he now makes his movie about an aspiring cartoonist who is a complete social misfit and outcast. The movie represents his comedy perfectly, and the soundtrack full of popular music (normal) shows how outrageous he is through juxtaposition. Anyway, the camera work is good, simple shots work best for comedies, and the editing is phenomenal, which is a necessity in any comedy. The shots can seem jumpy but it just adds to the hilarity and nonsense that you are watching.... like a cartoon.

It's also a great sendup of all those silly sentimental comedies about a needy man child seen as an idiot by the whole world but his one true love. By the way, I'm a fairly well adjusted 31 year old woman film buff, and I don't find jokes about bodily fluids inherently amusing.

As a performer, he's a walking car crash of scattered thoughts, improvised silliness and wilful absurdity - not what you'd call a mass-appeal personality. Granted, his schtick is far too weird or perverse for most people to comprehend or enjoy, yet that's exactly what I like about him. When he's funny he's good, and when he isn't funny it's even better. Conventional standards simply do not apply. To me the Tom Green Show was always determinedly anti-t.v. and with FGF we have the quintessential anti-movie.The beauty of FGF is that essentially it is a sentimental old-style Hollywood small-town boy makes good and finds his Daddy's acceptance model, except with a spewing geyser of deliberately stupid and inane diversions to distract you from thinking that the film and Tom might remotely have a point. Not that I particularly care for any inherent message in this at all, rather I have been content to sit back and watch Tom deliver a delightfully grotesque bastardisation of a piece of celluloid and stick the whole steaming mess to whichever naive executive types thought they could cash in on Tom's bizarro chic. Who cares if the film is good or not? I don't, and I'm pretty sure Tom doesn't either. As a viewer I got precisely what I expected - approximately 90 minutes of highly variable nonsense. I laughed at a lot of it, and was underwhelmed to a similar degree, but I honestly can say it was not a worthless experience. Simply put, it's purely Mr. Green, only more so. Surprisingly, FGF actually has quite a lively and savvy soundtrack. To my mind, any film which has its central character cruising down a highway to Gary Numan's alien techno masterpiece Cars and immediately follows it up with same character jerking a horse's penis, in gigglingly puerile fashion, has to have some virtues, however irredeemable to most folks. Oh, and what do I consider to be a truly bad film? Well, for me, an appallingly slack and inane vanity star-vehicle like Mission Impossible 2 gets my vote. In my view a humorless and self-important piece of drivel like this rates well down the list of cinema non-performers, and trails FGF by some distance. Still, that's just my opinion.

Somewhere along the way, they had a bad comedy experience, and this experience has led them to view the bizarre as redemptive purely for its unusual nature.A few things I hope Mr. Green comes to realize1) Weird is not necessarily edgy. 2) Doing something someone else finds too disgusting to contemplate doesn't push the boundaries, or expand anyone's horizons. 3) Making your audience cringe is nothing to be proud of. 4) The fact that people stop and stare when they see something awful doesn't mean that they're being entertained.There are probably plenty more, but why go into them?  Clearly he'll never pay any attention anyhow.One final thought.  Tom Green *can* be funny -- primarily when his comedic notions are channeled by the constraints of outsiders.

Green does a superb job in the lead role as Gordy, a 28-year-old wannabe cartoonist who refuses to move away from his slacker lifestyle. The plot, while interesting, is not the reason to see this movie. The reason to see FREDDY GOT FINGERED is for the gross-out-gags (95% of which are shockingly funny) and Tom Green's over-the-top comedic performance. Despite being somewhat of a box office bomb, FREDDY GOT FINGERED has already become a cult classic and according to Tom Green's autobiography, has made quite a large amount of money on DVD. Four years after its theatrical release, people around me still talk about it like its a lost gem. I predict its popularity will only grow in years to come and that one day Tom Green will make a comeback because he sure as hell deserves one.

Scott, remarked, it was unfairly lumped in with six or seven Farrelly Brothers rip-offs in which dewy-eyed teen romance is lazily broken up by knowingly nauseating humor (most often centered on semen). Although the film contains no embarrassing teen sex jokes along the lines of American Pie, it is still in the genre of gross-out comedy, hence, its release was poorly timed, from a critical standpoint. Once critics have seen three films of this type within a short period of time, they become that toxic combination of embittered and immune. They hate all films that resort to that disgust the audience tactic but eventually, they're also not shocked by them in the slightest.I think what really riled the critics on this one is that they couldn't dismiss FGF as just another lightweight scatological comedy. Its head is in an altogether more demented place. Aimless yet innocent creative gags (Tom Green wearing sausages on his head and playing the piano; Tom Green wearing a suit backwards and babbling I'm the backwards man, the backwards man; I can walk backwards fast as you can) coexist with truly macabre, borderline Lynchian ones (Tom Green reviving an unconscious baby by swinging it around by its umbilical cord, blood splattering on not only its mother but two Cumbaya-humming Mexicans in the maternal ward). The biggest flaw of the movie is, strangely, what makes it a fascinating anomaly; since its content shifts so sporadically from playful man-child antics to a seriously scarred relationship between the protagonist and his father (Rip Torn), the film is less failed comedy than a tragic parable on the inevitable arrested development of eccentrics.The Torn-Green theme provides the explanation for the more incongruous aspects of the movie, which is what a lot of critics hated the most. For instance, there's no real immediate purpose behind Green, en route from his Portland home to Hollywood to pitch an animation series, screeching to a halt at a horse farm and aiding the farmers in stimulating a stag. Nor is there much point behind him strapping a sausage to his crotch and yelling Ding dong! on a cheese factory's mobile strip. Yet the movie offers some smart variations from Green's MTV show, in which the only comic set-up is Green annoying shop owners, ball players and other poor saps to the point where they physically assault him or escort him from the premises. Knowing that attempting that sort of humor with hired actors in a real movie wouldn't generate much shock, the film mostly stages grandiose, one-person stunts as metaphors for Green's self-loathing. Mostly, he abuses himself. And you eventually notice that all his perversion, his idiotic babbling, his jaw-dropping naivete, is a result of stifled creativity. Torn lovingly accepts Green when he's aspiring to be mainstream but slaps him, berates him, destroys his artwork, etc., whenever Green is eccentric. No wonder he's such a malcontent.Now, sometimes the film goes too far, as Green's character occasionally behaves in such an aggressively awful way that it contradicts his sweeter elements. But that major flaw is also what takes the film into darker, more interesting territory than most comedies about overgrown children (ie Cabin Boy). And, after all the ugliness, the film ends on an upbeat, with son and father exuberantly making up and recognizing that they have both gone too far in their misanthropy. Most heartwarming of all, Torn has accepted that Green can indeed succeed with his artwork, which Daddy once labeled mere doodles. In short, it's a film in which the payoff of its ghastly, bodily function-spewed pranks is less a mood of detached hilarity than one of cringing melancholy. You want Green to grow up, to stop acting out constantly on his misguided ambitions, but, thanks to plenty of milder, gentler-toned scenes (which the critics of course completely overlooked) that paint him as deep down a morally sound person, you also want him to accept himself and live the tortured artist's dream.Freddy Got Fingered is not great art. I only laughed about four times, so, in my opinion, it failed as a comedy. I also wouldn't praise it in quite the same way A.O. Scott did, equating Green (who in real life, as demonstrated on the DVD commentary, doesn't know the meaning of the word irony), with 70's conceptualist pioneers like Bruce Nauman and Vito Acconci. The show is funnier, because of the reality of the stunts, and there's something timid about outrage being attempted within the fourth-wall confines of a movie. I would not call the movie smart. I would also not, however, call it incoherent or pointless. It's a dark, gruesome fable about a neglected child pining for acceptance. See it that way, and scenes like the one in which Green cuts open (an ACTUAL) deer carcass and wears it, upon a TV exec's advice to get inside his characters, actually begin to make some sort of twisted sense.

More like a rancid piece of plastic celluloid dipped in cra p to make it pass of like a feature film for theatrical screenings. And what's shocking is that IT ACTUALLY PLAYED IN THEATRES!First off, let me explain how I was pulled in to see this film. Oh it was a hot day. It was so hot it made the Sahara Desert look like sunny California. On that hot day, I saw the advertisements for FREDDY GOT FINGERED and it looked funny (but we all know about that placing-the-funny-part-of-the-film-in-the-trailer-to-get-us-unsuspecting-a udience-members-in-the-theatre routine). Nonetheless, I was laughing. Either that or it was the heat that was making me delerious with laughter. Well, me and my friend decided to go see this so-called Funny Filmon it's opening day. As soon as I entered the theatre, I was excited. That and the air conditioner was on so it just made my day.As I sat down, I knew this was made by Tom Green. I have seen his TV show and felt that he was a bit creative, but I felt that since he was now doing mainstream he would do better. Now let me veer of for a minute and tell you about Tom Green. I saw his breif performance in ROAD TRIP and I felt he had potential. But his character was short and felt that without his entire presence in ROAD TRIP the film endind up being the same old bad teen flick that tries to upstage FAST TIMES AT RIDGEMONT HIGH. I felt that if Green had a LONGER part in ROAD TRIP the film could have been better. But after seeing FREDDY GOT FINGERED, Green's LONG performance made me take back what I originally thought about him.So the movie starts, it was good. But after the first minute, THE FILM DIVES RIGHT INTO BEING UNWATCHABLE. Here is the story. Tom Green plays some dumb wannabe cartoonist who tries to get in the business, but he is told that in order to be a successful cartoonist the cartoon must have a plot (like this film really has one) and get to know his characters. So now Green does his bad sticks and...Well like I said, NO SPECIFIC PLOT WHATSOEVER.Their were some funny moments and Rip Torn was hilarious as Green's father, but I don't expect that Green's directorial tallents (and I use the term very LOOSELY)will be exposed in other features, bad jokes that go NOWHERE, and Rip Torn's career seems to be on a stand still becasue of this movie.Green's use of gross out comedy just does not work. He goes so gross out he even throws in some animal guts and a birth sequence so he can go over the top. It's like he is trying to ape director Peter Jackson's features BAD TASTE (1987) and BRAINDEAD (1992; U.S. Title DEAD ALIVE). But here is the problem. Jackson's BAD TASTE and BRAINDEAD are FUNNY gory horror-comedies that led him to make HEAVENLY CREATURES (1994), THE FRIGHTENERS (1996) and the upcoming LORD OF THE RINGS trilogy. Where has Green gone now? Nowhere. In fact, Green has been out of sight for so long he is forgotten by now (except his film, which needs to be forgotten). Only his fans defend him. And as much as I like their persistance in getting Green to come out and try again, I would give up because his work is worthless and not worth saving. And worst of all, HE IS NOT TALENTED!FREDDY GOT FINGERED is a pure example of Hollywood at it's worst. Though PEARL HARBOR took that name later on, FREDDY GOT FINGERED remains a bad film altogether. It is forgettable, unwatchable, and not entertaining at all. To say Tom Green is a gifted comic is like saying Jim Carrey is REALLY FUNNY! Both are not funny, but I would rather watch Jim Carrey act like a retard than see Tom Green grabing an animal's penis (and yes, Green does that in his film).So if you are THAT DESPERATE to see Tom Green's first (and only) directorial debut, watch FREDDY GOT FINGERED at your own risk. But to those who are able to see how bad his film is without watching it then good for you. Me, I payed my $7.50 and I was not pleased.

Taking up the challenge to give the movie a chance, I rented the DVD.I was wrong.I laughed three times, two of which were at the movie (as opposed to the 'joke'). The most entertaining scene is at the beginning where we watch Tom Green skateboard through a mall, doing a few tricks. From there, it quickly goes downhill and flat-lines, plumbing the depths of  banality.'Freddy' consists of a loose collection of trite, tedious scenes. And when the all-too-few plot/humor ideas run out, they just show Tom Green screaming as a substitute. Unfortunately, Green isn't funny by any stretch of the imagination. Generous use of the fast-forward feature helped ease my suffering.A few choice examples of bad, pointless 'Tom' scenes include Taking a shower in scuba gear; Masturbating a horse; Having a kid get hit in the face (again).These scenes have no connection with either characters or plot - that would have required a level of sophistication completely foreign to the movie's creators.There were some interesting actors/actresses/cameos in the movie. Unfortunately, there was no opportunity for them to contribute. Rip Torn, Anthony Michael Hall, Julie Hagerty, and Drew Barrymore have apparently hit the bottoms of their careers. Did they actually read the script before they signed on?Of note, Shaquille O'Neal makes a funny 30 second cameo providing some much-needed relief.In the end, I can't recommend this movie to anyone and I won't be watching it again.

It was so awful that I needed to see if its reputation was deserved. Is it? Pretty much.The movie's plot - son trying to sell cartoon, trapped by evil father blah blah - is merely an excuse for Tom Green's character, Gord Brody, to engage in bizarre, and often disgusting, acts. These acts intend to be humorous by way of grossing out the audience. Green seems to think that, by taking the extreme approach to comedy he'll arrive in the land of laughs. No, wrong Tom - all you get me wondering why on earth you do what you do in this movie (which is acts such as animal masturbation, wearing a dead deer carcass, and having a child fall into the rotor blades of a plane). I'm left with a puzzled expression - how are most of these gags possibly to be interpreted as humour? I doubt Green is making some bizarre meta-statement about humour and sensibilities - he's merely going for sick cheap gags. It'd be maybe made better if he had any acting abilities - instead his `skills' are limited to making bizarre faces, repeating certain phrases over and over in a rising voice, flailing his arms about, and generally looking like a right twit. The abilities of the other actors are somewhat inconsequential - they're doomed from the start by the script.Should I even mention the direction? Suffice to say the movie flows as well as a car with square wheels can drive. The jarring editing, the awful camera work, the dreadful sense of timing.. It's an achievement that got Mr. Green the Worst Director at the Razzie awards, and he deserved it.The film does have some saving graces, namely the credits and one or two amusing moments. But overall it's a shoddy, poorly performed, unfunny mess of a movie which attempts to use surrealism (he's no Wes Anderson) and gross events for comedic value but actually fails to generate a laugh, only a sigh of distaste.

While I like how Tom Green has his Gord Brody stand up to his domineering dad Jim (played by the wacky Rip Torn), his lack of directorial experience and his meager on-screen experience is not enough to sustain this comedy. The use of dead deer was completely unnecessary and did NOTHING to spur the plot along. Also, the vulgar Jim's destroying Gord's cartoon drawings was enough for me to beg Gord to punch that guy in the mouth with a pair of brass knuckles on both fists. Marisa Coughlan's Betty is gutsy for pursuing her goal as a paraplegic rocket scientist, but from a physiological standpoint a paraplegic has no sensations from the waist down. Therefore, her love scenes with Gord border on the ridiculous. The title itself might have been better called The Brody Family is a Mess since Freddy is not the lead character and the movie doesn't revolve aroung the young businessman's antics. Nevertheless, the film's message warns against picking on relatively late blossomers like Gord, and Jim should have left his son's drawings alone.

His mean father is not happy about his son moving back and not having a job, so Gordon gets a job at a cheese restaurant.

Upon asking him why, he told me that it was one of the most hilarious films he had ever seen. I usually find this particular person's opinion correct, so I bought the DVD.I must say, I did find it very funny, but also very extreme. This film has very much been built up on it's controversy, like many other films. Some quotes include, 'purile and disgusting' 'highly offensive' and 'stupid, immoral and idiotic.' All of the above are true.But it is also very, very funny.I had never heard of Tom Green before, so I didn't really know what to expect. I put on the DVD, and judging by the cover, the blurb and the beginning of the film, it seemed like a light hearted, stupid slapstick fare. I wish I had paid more attention to the rating.The storyline is non - existent. Well, very little anyway. Gordy, a wannabe animator, tries to make a break for Hollywood, making just enough money as a cheese sandwich factory worker. But he fails miserably, and goes back to living at home with his parents.That is all the 'storyline' I could decipher. What follows is a barrage of offensively brilliant comedy, including the infamous deer scene.For 90% of the films running time, it doesn't really make sense. That is the one thing you must remember. But it is not supposed to. I think that it is not the deer scene that sets the tone, though. It's another.Here's the scene Gordy and his friend, Darren are standing on a half - pipe built outside Gordy's home. Darren tries to do a bit of skating, and trips up and breaks his leg - bone poking out through the skin, blood everywhere, and Darren screaming. This really took me aback - I wasn't really expecting anything so disgusting. While I was laughing a retching at Tom Green's childish antics during this scene, I never really recovered from it.Although not all the humour is disgusting; some of it is just plain weird. For example, the sketch where Gordy hangs sausages from the ceiling and hooks them up to the piano strings, so that when he plays on the piano the sausages go up and down, made me crack a grin. He plays while randomly singing in an off - tone voice, 'Daddy, would you like some sausage? Daddy would you like some sausages? It made me smile just out of pure curiosity.Also in the bizarre section of the humour of this movie is the 'Treasure' sequence, in which Gordy childishly pretends he is a deep sea diver in the shower, and pretends that soap on a rope is treasure. This had me a bit weirded out, to say the least.And last, but not least, is the 'Backwards Man' sequence. This is brilliant/stupid depending on who you talk to. In my opinion, this sequence is one of the films stand out moments.But what I really think makes Freddy Got Fingered shine is the moments which parody the usual Hollywood schmaltz's. For example'Oh Gordy,I don't care about jewels. All I really wanna do is.... suck your c***''This has been a valuable life lesson. This trip hasn't been about spending about acting like a d***, shouting at the top of my voice like a hyperactive child or whacking off an elephant. This trip has been about the fact that one million dollars should be spent the right way. The American way. Blowing it all in one go on a load of s*** I will never need'So sure, this movie ain't no masterpiece. But it is a damn fine comedy, one that made me laugh a lot, and a truly offensive one too.And you don't see that too often nowadays.

Judy Carter, in her wonderfully insightful Stand-Up Comedy  The Book, summed it up best  Some people will laugh at a guy slipping on a banana peel.  Some people will only laugh at Hitler slipping on a banana peel.  What kills with one crowd will die with the next, and no two people will laugh at the same thing for the same reason.  Comedy, in many ways, says more about the laughers than the comedians themselves, and it is no wonder that comedy shop talk is filled with violent images (If I don't bomb, I'm gonna murder that audience).  Comedy, to put it mildly, is DANGEROUS.Freddy Got Fingered, Tom Green's scabrous black comedy, illustrates  this principle to a T.  Since his earliest days on Canadian cable-access television, Green has based his career on pushing the envelope.  Like Andy Kaufman, his bizarre stunts (many involving animal carcasses and the sexual humiliation of his parents) are primarily about the reaction of both their hapless victims and US, the audience; if you don't step back and consider how you're taking this humor, and why, you're not really getting the whole Green experience.  Freddy carries this sensibility into a fictional format, giving us the strange tale of a man who lives his life as an experiment in riling people up.Gord Brody (Green) is a young aspiring cartoonist who fails miserably in his attempt to break into the Hollywood big time.  He is forced to move back home with his parents, setting off a titanic battle of wills with his stentorian oaf of a father (Rip Torn), an escalating conflict that involves accusations of child molestation, sausages on strings, elephant penises, horse penises, Green's penis, and really badly made cheese sandwiches. Of course, all of this story nonsense is just that  nonsense.  It serves no function but to provide Green and co-writer Derek Harvie with a framework for grotesque, deliberately shocking set pieces, many of which work surprisingly well.  There's a brief sojourn at a stud farm, where Gord lives out an apparently lifelong fantasy, wagging a horse's genitals while yelling I'm a farmer! like a drunken barbarian.  In another scene, Gord delivers a baby, ripping the bloody umbilical cord with his teeth.  He picks up a wheelchair-bound girlfriend (Marisa Coughlin) who gets her jollies by being caned in the legs with a bamboo stick.  And there's the wonderful little boy who spends the whole movie getting accidentally brutalized, hit by cars and running into airplane propellers, always with much blood and flying viscera.Now I know this may not sound that funny, and indeed, Freddy has gotten the most dastardly reviews that I think I have ever seen for a major release.  Critics don't just hate Freddy; they seem personally hurt by the film, as if Green had made the picture just to upset them and get their goat.  What they don't seem willing to acknowledge is that Green made the film for EXACTLY that reason, and is getting exactly the reaction he wants.  Therefore, his film can be regarded as something of a great success. Personally, I agree with many of the critics who have described Freddy as surrealist.  There is no attempt to integrate this action into anything resembling the real world.  Gord is not a human being, but rather a collection of characteristics.  Green plays him as a bizarrely aggressive man-child, a mishmash of helplessly repeated words and phrases, slack-jawed willful stupidity, and screaming, utterly pointless hysterics.  Frankly, I admire this approach to the characterization.  After seeing so many recent comedies ruined by the filmmakers' need to make their characters both laughable and likeable (most recently with the stultifying Joe Dirt), it is refreshing to see Green so willing to come off as annoying, hateful, cruel, UNLIKEABLE.  This lack of relatability allows us to laugh at him without feeling like we're also laughing at ourselves. I am not making the claim, as some on this page have, that Freddy Got Fingered is any kind of masterpiece.  Green's direction is not the equal of his acting bravery.  The film suffers from too many muddy visuals, and many moments just lie there on the screen, wriggling when they should fly.  Still, the film does what it is supposed to.  Half the time you're laughing, the other half just staring at the screen in goggle-eyed shock.  You may hate Freddy, you may love it, but either way, you have to admit that you've never seen anything like it before.

But of course, things won't be easy as he must face troubles from his abusive father and doubtful peers that poses as a bumpy obstacle.Without a doubt, this film had a huge promise to be more than just a simple film that pays homage and plays as a satire. This film had potential to be used as a love-letter and instant classic for all struggling creators out there that can't get into the entertainment industry and must face constant deception from a disloyal audience. Most of the humor and the story would be set in the right place with the characters, but the (literal) executions and overall payoff is degraded into a horrific experience for both the cast and viewers.It's a shame.

It's a certain type of comedy and it isn't for everybody (apparently Midsummer Nights Dream was a 'comedy' but I didn't laugh once) but if you like your funnies daft and odd this is worth a go.

It could also be excruciatingly horrible. It all depends on what kind of mood you're in. This film appeals to the rawest of sense of humour. You don't need to understand anything to laugh your head off at just how stupid the whole thing is, because it's all about the shock factor (obviously, it being tom green). What makes you laugh is not the 'intelligent comedy' or even the 'slapstick' aspect of it. It's more about the disbelief about what Tom Green as an actor is actually doing. The horse scene illustrates this example perfectly. However there is also intelligent comedy which ties up the whole thing if you're willing to actually pay attention between laughs. For example, the 'you got a problem with my legs?' bit. It's hilarious. And of course there is the 'family guy' style comedy, like the 'proud' scene at the beginning, where they hold a not-so-funny joke for so long until it's actually funny. But as I say, you have to be in the right mood. If you're in the 'lets watch something stupid' mood, this is definitely the film to see. But if you're in a cynical, deep-thought kind of mood, give this one a miss for now - it will just ruin the awesomeness of it.

And like many people I was also under the impression that FGF was another painfully cliché contrived piece of Hollywood. I was dead wrong on the second point.I'm a believer in the theory that if a film reaches a certain level of badness that, that badness somehow translates into goodness. FGF is not so much a film as it is an experience into the twisted mind of Tom Green. It's disgusting, bizarre, and absolutely HILARIOUS! This film actually had me laughing to the point of tears multiple times and that's a feat not often accomplished.The basic plot of FGF goes something like this, Gord (Tom Green) is an aspiring cartoonist who goes to Hollywood to try and sell his drawings. Without success he moves back in with his parents and younger brother Freddy. His short tempered father (Rip Torn) demands that he stop goofing off and get a real job. The ongoing feud between the two results in a string of outlandish pranks and revenges.FGF is relentless in throwing every kind of bizarre nonsensical situation at you that it can possibly muster. From getting inside the animals to searching for sunken treasure from cheese helmets to Zebras in America nothing is predictable and nothing is sacred. The source of most of the humour comes from Tom Green's bizarre Jekyll and Hyde act. One minute Gord is a normal almost bland young man the next he's some kind of insane ADHD driven six year old on crack. That may sound like an exaggeration but give the film 15 minutes and I assure you you'll be converted.Is it perfect? No. The film doesn't always hit the mark and some of the situations are just plain gross without a funny quality to them, but the product as a whole is so unique from anything else and contains so many priceless gags and one liners, that its faults can easily be overlooked. If you hated the Tom Green Show this will only strength your opinion, but if you're open to the outlandish ignore the critics and take Freddy for a spin. Being really drunk or stoned also helps.

Gord wants nothing more in life to become a famous animator. He travels to Hollywood to shop his animations, only to be rejected. The plot thickens as Gord's lunatic father (played by Rip Torn) constantly heckles him to get his ass out that door looking for a job. There are some subplots to the film, but overall, the story focuses on Gord becoming an animator. Confused where the title comes into play here? It is revealed about half-way through the film, and one of the most memorable moments therein. There is even a surprise ending that I don't think anybody saw coming. But that's just typical Tom Green for you.Here is a warning. This movie is not, I repeat, IS NOT for kids. The humor is disgusting and obviously based on Tom Green's intent of seeing how much he can shock and gross out his audience. In my opinion, he succeeded. But that's one quality I love in this movie.

Before you jump to conclusions, I am a college graduate and I had been moved out and on my own before this. Things sometimes don't work out the way you'd like, and unfortunately this happened to me. As well I paid for my college, never had a car given to me or that sort of thing either.At any rate, my step-father was constantly harping on me to get a job. What I kept responding with was I was looking, for something in my career field, in which I had an education, training, and experience. His focus was job and my focus was a job that I like, am good at, and can earn a decent living.Of course to a much less extreme, my life was much like Gord's in this movie. Mr. Brody was like my step-father, and we did in many ways of course get on each others nerves. So as stupid as it may sound, it's actually possible that someone could relate this movie to reality.I enjoyed this movie thoroughly. In fact, even today I still watch it once in a while, and it still makes me laugh. I always liked Green's MTV show, and to me of any movies he's been in this is the most like his show.Gord isn't a real bright fellow. He's friendly, innocent, definitely naive, immature and child-like. Yes, he's 28, unemployed and basically wants to play all the time as a child does. But Gord is looking at his talents as an animator, then using that to see the big picture.Of course, this is something his father could never understand. Was Gord's child like motivations merely building blocks for his drawings? I think so, at least a little. This is something his father never could understand. Besides, who could hardly blame Gord's outlook of the working world? In reality it does suck. Most people are under paid, little appreciated, and Gord knows this makes this point to his brother in the movie.Great scenes in this movie include Dave Davidson, getting inside the animals, the first date, the restaurant (this is a fancy restaurant!), , the audition, the bank scene, and many others.Another likable aspect of this movie is the soundtrack. The music that was chosen was great and matched the movie well. Of course, the supporting cast is top notch as well, but that's been said many times.People who take this movie too seriously, well, just need to loosen up. It's purely meant as a comedy, and to be funny. At that, as crazy as it is, the movie succeeds brilliantly. This movie is totally under rated. While I don't think it's a 10, it surely isn't a 3.5. At a minimum, it should at least be a 4-5 average. Personally, There's no way 33% of IMDb users should have voted the lowest on this movie.Maybe next time I become unemployed, and move back home, I'll find an elephant to whack off and hose my step father down!

I watched an edited version without the masturbation of the horse scene. So it is that I find it intriguing that so many people would be offended by this film because every other scene is not disturbing, in my eyes, at all.  What I must attribute some peoples blinded vision of this film to is this scene with Green taking on the role of the stud farmers. You will note most people point to the scene as the 'disturbing' point of the film and then continue to label the film as such.But what others find disturbing obviously I do not.  I have watched many films of a graphic nature and I will draw your attention to a brilliant film by Quentin Tarantino, Reservoir Dogs.  This film is extremely violent, at one stage depicting the attempted burning of a policeman simply for the pleasure of a sadistic man, after he has tortured the poor soul by slicing off his ear. This scene made me feel sick and I am sure that any human, excluding psychopaths, would feel disturbed also.  This scene is an example of 'disturbing'.  BUT we label this film as brilliant.  We see through the disturbing violence to the film within. But when you watch a film with a man wanking a horse, all you see is a man wanking a horse.Now, don't persecute me for comparing Tarantino to Green but I needed a writer who most consider brilliant, who also uses graphic images within their films. To show you that if you look deeper into this film, well, you'll find an alternative to the boring monotonous comedy of today. Freddy Got Fingered takes the on normal routines of generated film.  Man chases his dream , can't make it, returns home, finds love, is inspired, returns to chase his dream and finally succeeds.  But the film does so in a way that mocks Hollywood films -  Man chases his dream (to be a cartoonist) , can't make it (at the cheese sandwich factory), returns home, finds love (with a woman in a wheelchair), is inspired (by his love, who builds a rocket wheel chair), returns to chase his dream and finally succeeds (and wastes a million dollars on jewels and taking his dad to Pakistan).  I mean, come on, the film is not meant to be taken seriously.  It's like Monty Python and the Holy Grail, with the coconuts, it doesn't make sense but it is funny, I'm sure you all found men pretending to ride horses to the sound of coconuts clanging amusing?But some people are so high on their critic chairs and so blinded by embarrassment I suppose that they can't bring themselves to admit it is humourous.A little story.I have a friend.  We were in a situation where a quote from Freddy Got Fingered was appropriate.  He said to me `I saw that movie the other day, it wasn't very funny, I didn't laugh at all'.  We got to talking about it and after about fifteen minutes he had decided that it was a reasonable waste of time... Later that week he said `I watched Freddy Got Fingered again the other day...' and he began to ramble off lots of quotes that he found amusing.  After another week the subtle comedy of  Freddy Got Fingered had slowly dripped into the back of his mind and he told me without hesitation that he had changed his opinion of the movie altogether.  This is exactly how I felt about the film.  I had been so flattened out by the drab and standard films I had been watching that I wasn't open to the intense comedy of Freddy Got Fingered. Before you watch this film I must say a few things. 1) It is twisted, yes, so if you want normal, look elsewhere. 2) You will be shocked. 3) Have an open mind and 4) Don't be embarrassed by a man masturbating a horse!Two Thumbs up, 10/10.

And the kid from American Pie who plays Stifler's mom's love interest is Freddy in this movie.  He's a pretty cool kid.  And he's kinda cute too.  In his nerdish sort of way.I give this movie a 10 out of 10 because it rocks my gym socks!

For one it stars Tom Green who is probably the least serious person in the entire world, I mean if you get testicular cancer, joke about it and have the actual operation filmed you must either be completely insane, or just his way of dealing with which I think it probably was as it made it easier on him, so you would expect his directorial debut to be the most serial comedy in years and that's what it was and a bloody good one because there is no real story to it, unless you count father and son bonding after getting ejaculated in the face by large elephant, but the I think Tom Green just wanted to make a stupid film and that's what it is and that's why I think it's one of the best comedies in years because it's just pure laughter.  It's like extreme cinema but in a comedy fashion and does not care about the parallels of movie making, let's just have fun and in one point in your life you need to look at it that way.  Freddy Got Fingered is all about not taking movie making so seriously, and I do take films seriously but you need to just take a break sometimes and unwind and take Freddy Got Fingered for what it is.

A slap in the face to mainstream cinema, and an even bigger slap to his fans, Green has chosen to make a film with no redeeming value.  It's a no-win situation.  If you say you hate it, Tom wins.  If you love it, Tom wins, but you lose all your friends.  Green wants you all to himself, and he'll do it any way he can.  I won't go into all the disgusting shenanigans that Tom gets into, because you all know them by now.

He's the little boy who just wants attention, no matter what it takes to get it. So why do I like it so much?

Tom Green is actually a fairly better filmmaker than he is an actor. As a director he isn't afraid to do what Tom Green does best, which is shock people in disgusting and surprising ways. Anybody who went to this movie expecting to see a mainstream slapstick comedy obviously had the wrong idea in mind; this is a gross out dark comedy that actually keeps its jokes funny while keeping them gross. The childbirth scene in which Green swings the baby around his head to the chanting of some other patients is downright hilarious in its sur-real weirdness, and his first date is without a doubt the funniest and most creative thing in the movie. Too bad he can't film a good ending to go with any of this; the movie's pace sputters and dies about 20 minutes before the final frame, as the credits roll to unfunny outtakes. Throughout its beginning and half of its middle section, Freddy Got Fingered is not only good but different, and that's high praise for a film in this recent wave of lame gross out comedies (Slackers and Saving Silverman are two horrible examples).

There's several things that I found offensive, such as the little kid who kept getting hit, (just what the hell was funny about having his teeth knocked out?)  the deer scene, or making child molestation part of the humor.  The movie also actually took itself seriously, as if the quest for Tom Green's character to be an animator was something the audience would be rooting for.  Maybe it's supposed to be part of the joke, who knows.  But writing a bizarre cartoon called Zebras in America (which was twisted but seemed like something MTV would run) then using the money to secretly cart his father to Pakistan, which somehow resolves everything--I don't get it.  The whole bit about him being a hostage was pointless, and I could almost hear some studio executive saying, It's a bomb already, finish it!Rip Torn must have been desperate to play the father, and it was really sad to see sweet Julie Hagerty appear in this, which is a million miles from Airplane!I did find a few minor chuckles, like the Backwards Man bit but overall it was about as fun as getting teeth pulled.

Roger Ebert quoted, Tom Green made no attempt to entertain the audience. From my opinion, I was entertained completely from begining to end.A 28 year old loser named Gord Brody (Tom Green) has just failed miserabley at becoming an animator in Hollywood. He is forced to move back home with his annoying parents, his grumpy father Jim (Rip Torn) and his over protective mother Julie (Julie Hagerty). While staying with his parents, Gord and Jim are at eachothers throats. Jim apparently feels that Gord doesn't work hard enough and Julie feels that Jim is very abusive to Gord. Gord also meets the 10 times more annoying Betty (Marisa Coughlin) who is only intersted in oral sex and rockets.There is very sick humor in this movie and that includes Gord masturbating a horse and an elephant, delivering a baby by biting off the umbilical cord, gutting a deer and crawling inside, Gord wacking Betty with a bamboo stick to give her an orgasm, plus a lot more.I personally found this movie to be very funny but at the same time very stupid. If you are a fan of Tom Green, then you will appreciate this movie a lot more than others.Note   This movie was also written and directed by Tom GreenPG version available on DVD (A waste of time though.)

I have never liked his show from the first time I saw his show on MTV.  That being said, if you dont like Tom Green then you are not going to like this movie.  I did chuckle a few times but that is about as far as it went.  This is the exact way I would always react to his show, a few chuckles, but more annoyance with Greens over the Top antics than anything. However, this is not even the reason that I didnt like this movie so much.  It just didnt have much of a plot.  It was more of an excuse for Green to do pretty much the same act and routines that he has done on his show with pretty much the same affect that it always had on me, I would lough for a few seconds then he would drag it out and it just become too much.  The plot is paper thin and the character development is even thinner. I really have no idea why Harlan William's character would even hang around with Green's which again is the same question I would always ask about Greens real life characters on his show. The only aspect that makes this movie watchable if you dont like Green is Rip Torn.  Torn's reacts to Greens antics the same way that I have always wished people would react to him, with violence.  Torn is the perfect foil for Green and his reactions to Green are really some of the funniest scenes I have seen in a comedy in a while.  Speaking other comedies, that is another aspect of the movie that I can give some credit too.  This movie knows that it is dumb and doesnt try to convince anyone otherwise unlike American Pie or countless other teen movies that try to show someone learning some kind of lesson in the end.  What you see is what you get with Green, seems loud, unlikable, obnoxious and down right cruel, which is the same exact image that you have when the movie is over. So in closing, the movie isn't really as terrible as most critics would have you believe, but it just doesnt do anything other than provide Green with an excuse to do the same stuff that he has been doing on MTV on the big screen. If you like Tom Green (which I dont) I give it an eight.  If you dont like Green, watch something else because I give it a 3 at best.

No, Freddy Got Fingered isn't as good as even the worst films by those two mavericks, but rather they share the single minded purpose of the director.  Robert Altman's films want to show you the many singular personalities of an ensemble cast.  Stanley Kubrick wants to use the entire universe as his play thing.  Tom Green?  Well, Tom Green just wants to kill you.  It's that simple.Freddy Got Fingered is pure, unadulterated malice.  Evil of a kind that could only be rivalled by the glint in the eye of Satan himself.  But it's not malice for any ethnic group, political party, or religion.  No, no.  Just YOU!  For eighty-seven minutes, Green beats you over the head relentlessly with shocking and perverted imagery.  Makes the movie going experience uncomfortable.  Makes your life a living hell.  Why?  For his own sick amusement.  But in a way, this is a refreshing kind of approach.  Tired am I of seeing movie after movie pander to my good side.  Cute little computer generated monsters, eleven year olds seeing dead people, other eleven year olds riding around on brooms, and hobbits, hobbits, hobbits.  One cannot live by Kate & Leopold alone.Sitting through this film the first time was one of the most mystifying experiences I've ever had in a theater.  At first I was disgusted, then offended, then bored, then all of that gave way to sheer dumbstruck awe.  He's really going to go all the way through with this, I thought.  Then many months later I decided to pick up the DVD to see what kind of mind operates like this.On the director's commentary, Green was very evasive as to what went into the film or why he settled on that story (or indeed any story).  But the clincher was the laugh track taken of the audience's reaction at the world premiere.  The laughing stopped twenty minutes in as it gave way to groans and uneasy silence.  Now his pleasure is yours too.  Listen to that audience squirm.Normally I would give this a star rating, but I don't know what the hell it is.  It's not so much a movie as it is a experiment.

It's not a great movie (many will hate it), but after the tepid Tomcats and Joe Dirt this is one gross-out comedy that's at once fearless and culturally resonant. Bringing his comic terrorism to the feature film medium, the terminally unhinged Tom Green continues his assault on middle-class complacency. He plays Gord, a 28-year-old man-child whose odd behaviour and dream of becoming an animator makes him the shame of his career-minded father (Rip Torn). When he lands a job at a cheese sandwich factory, his concentration is quickly deterred by his impulsive habits of skateboarding through malls and manually masturbating horses. Good taste is obviously a non-issue, but there's an underlying sweetness that prevents the humour from being very hurtful. Within the scatology, Green (who's also the director and co-writer) structures a fairly honest thesis about the fear of losing one's individuality to responsibility and adulthood. It's no accident that the film's most likeable character is Gord's sexually-deviant, wheelchair-bound girlfriend. For all its leaps of the insane imagination, a little of Freddy Got Fingered goes a long way. Its caustic energy occasionally becomes tiresome, but the movie provides the big laughs and jolts its title suggests without ever selling out or playing safe.

Most of the moments in the movie make absolutely no sense and there is almost absolutely no story present. Most of the humor is also very vulgar and just totally over-the-top gross and visual.

The jokes in the movie really aren't that strong but because they are delivered so incredibly over-the-top and stupid, it becomes truly an hilarious movie at times. Yes, so basically the movie is so stupid that it becomes a good one.The story is just totally weird and stupid and lacks some consistency.

Anyone who has seen his show knows that Green has a perverse, eccentric (to say the least) approach to humor.  And this is a perverse, eccentric movie. What's missing?  The laughs, of course.I've watched The Tom Green Show many times, and I almost always laugh out loud.  Green doesn't have any wit or structure behind his humor, but he's the kind of guy you have to laugh AT.  And when you do, you'll laugh big.  He's an acquired taste, and I've acquired it.This is Green's first starring role, an effort he also directed and co-wrote.  His past appearances have been in supporting roles in such films as Road Trip (where he was hilarious) and Charlie's Angels (where he was lame, but nowhere as lame as the overall film).  Perhaps, he should stick with the supporting roles.  When he actually tries to write a film with a story and characters, it's a total mess!  I'd rather watch him humiliate random civilians on his show.  I think what makes the humor on his show click is that there's variety, and you don't know what to expect.  A new surprise every week.  Like the Howard Stern Show.  In this film, he recycles the same crappy, brainless gags over and over again.  This includes verbal gags in which he repeats the same sentence two or more times.  It's funny at times, but in the long run it's just silly and dull.  There's also a disgusting array of humor involving masturbating animals (as in HUMANS masturbating the animals).  OK, so Eyes Wide Shut had to be cut for the R-rating because of a few explicit sex scenes, but this movie gets away with an R while displaying an elephant drowning a guy with his semen.Green does some very outrageous stuff on his show, the most notorious being a gag where he sucks milk out of a cow's udder.  Well, imagine that outrageousness...UNCENSORED!!  As if the stuff he got away with on TV wasn't shocking enough.  Some of these gags are downright sadistic.  One example is when he delivers a baby and cuts the umbelical cord with his teeth.  As a result, blood squirts all over the place.  Excuse me if I sound like a prude.  If things like that make you crack up--first of all, I won't ask, and second, this is the movie for you and you don't have to read another word of this review.  There's also a running gag involving a young boy getting violently injured.  As if there wasn't enough sadistic comedy, there's one where Harland Williams gets into a skateboarding accident and the bone from his knee pokes through his flesh.  Green comes over and licks the blood off his bloody knee, with a smile on his face.I don't mind watching a disturbing film, as long as it has a message, a moral, some sort of point.  And I don't mind dark comedy, as long as it's done right.  I believe almost anything can be made funny, with appropriate handling.  Just watch the graphically violent comedy Very Bad Things and you'll see what I mean.  Or even Fargo--a better example.  I was just glad the whole child abuse subplot in this movie wasn't taken to extremes--that's about the best compliment I can give.  There's a pretty funny scene where Green says F**k you to his foul-mouthed, pedophilic father (well-played by Rip Torn).  Dad takes it literally, pulls down his pants and wants him to do just that.  Twisted, but funny...in a twisted way.  So in case you're wondering if the title Freddy Got Fingered really means what you think it means--you guessed correctly.  And Freddy is not Green's character, it's the character of his brother, played by Eddie Kaye Thomas.And of course, we can't have a sadistic comedy without a touch of misogynism.  The only major female character is a nymphomaniac!!  I'm sure feminists everywhere will p**s in their panties when they watch Green's nympho love interest (Marisa Coughlan) continually insist on giving him a b**w job.I've seen dark, shocking, cynical humor before--but this is borderline Satanic, not to mention dull.  I guess Green's intention was to make this like a car accident  have the audience gasp at the horror, yet at the same time have their eyes glued to the scene anticipating what will happen next. Well, I don't know about the rest of you guys, but I could not wait for this movie to be over!  The only reason why I watched it straight-through was because I wanted to get it over with, so I won't have to continue watching it another time!  And it just got more and more exhausting by the minute.As I said, I like Tom Green--in general--and his show cracks me up, but writing, directing and acting in movies is not his forte.  This is simply mindless (I often exaggerate when I use that word, but this time I'm as literal as can be!!!) tripe that tries to excuse itself as low-brow, eccentric comedy.  I never said Green was a comic genius, but he does have a good deal of potential.  It's hard trying to dignify a man whose humor is capable of making Kindergarteners roll their eyes, but when I'm laughing--I'm laughing.  And I don't try to get too scientific about it.

If you think Tom Green is hilarious, like some of us, you will find this movie, for the most part, hilarious.  It's gags are very similar to his show, but going heavier than usual on the gross-out.  The plot is weak, but no weaker than a standard comedy; anyway, the plot doesn't matter.  Green comes at you nonstop with gags, lines, sausages, penises, and even fetuses.  This movie should be given a chance; in my opinion it is the best comedy so far this year, and it certainly is the most original.

Never in the history of entertainment has there been a personality like Tom Green, with the only one coming to mind that was even close would be Andy Kaufman.  Both of these comedians had a lot of their success in the world of TV only to flop critically in the film industry. It will be interesting to see what Green does in the future...is he really the next Andy? This movie is another extremely stupid excercise into the warped humor of Green.  In this semi-autobiographical movie Green allows some truly disgusting and unconventional images such as the genitalia of animals to fill the screen while following the story of Gord, a cartoonist trying to get his ideas published and live his dream.   For fans of Green's show, this is a must, with even more outrageous sights brought to the screen and a constant string of laughs.To others, it will be a rightfully offensive mess, but then again, that's probably what Green wanted.

Perhaps they were expecting some sort of traditional movie with traditional humor.  Or maybe they know of Tom Green and so they were expecting something that was quite over the edge, but still following the conventional guidelines of a movie.  Freddy Got Fingered is way over the edge, though.  It smashes through boundaries which many of us think would never be broken, resulting in some of the funniest material in history.  Fortunately, certain people, like me, can enjoy the kind of humor that basically made the film.I'll admit that this wasn't so much of a movie, per se, as it was a 1-1/2 hour laugh-fest.  While not every single gag was side-splittingly funny, some of the gags were so unbelievably and hilariously inane that I couldn't sit down because I was laughing so hard.  The best example I can think of was the sausage/keyboard scene.  I dropped half my popcorn all over the floor because I couldn't control myself laughing.All I can say is that I feel sorry for anyone who didn't like this movie at least for its humor.  I'll bet a lot of people deep down thought that this movie was hilarious but were too embarrassed to admit that this kind of humor is funny and so dismissed it as infantile, sophomoric and crude.  I guess its their loss.  This was truly one of the funniest movies I've seen in a long time.  For its humor value alone, I give this movie a 10/10.

After viewing the film, I realized how on-the-money these critics are about it. It's a mostly bad comedy, probably only fully enjoyable to die-hard fans of Tom Green, who can be funny, but only in small parts. He is mostly unfunny and annoying here.However, there were some moments that made me laugh, mostly those that were in the commercials, such as the backwards dance, the sausage song, the cheese helmet, the opening (that is, until Tom out of nowhere plays with a horse's penis) and a random cameo by Shaq. But these are overshadowed by gross gags that are just not funny and completely unnecessary. Was there really a need for scenes of cutting open a deer, licking a open wound, swinging a baby by its umbilical cord (which by the way, Green cuts with his teeth), a laugh-less running gag about a little boy being injured, and shooting his maniac father (Rip Torn) with elephant semen? I don't think so. The film's title, by the way, concerns Green's character Gord framing his father for molesting his brother, Freddy, during a therapy section. Could someone tell me how is this funny? If anything, these scenes reveal how mentally whacked Green is.What amazes me, like the many other critics, is that Fingered was greenlighted by Fox, with nationwide ad campaigns and in many theaters while a funny silly comedy like Kung Pow was treated like dirt.Freddy Got Fingered could have been a hilarious dumb comedy, but it ends up being just DUMB, and not in a good way.

Freddy Got Fingered is one of the most unusual films I have ever seen. Not necessarily for its endless gross-out humor, but the way the gross out humor dovetails into a heartfelt story about a guy who's desperate for his father's attention. Gordy, our uh... hero, played by Tom Greene (who thankfully just acts like himself instead of trying to create a character), is a 28 yr. old slacker, a little kid living in the body of an adult. He's trying to impress dad in his own way and failing miserably. You can tell that after years of emotional neglect Gordy's resorted to shock value, the only thing that seems to get the old man's attention. His aberrant behavior is not confined to family situations either. Gordy figures acting like a complete idiot is the only thing that can get anyone's attention. Most of the time he's right. As he tries to make his shallow Hollywood dream come true, forms a relationship with an orally romantic paraplegic woman, and basically struggles to interact, he has to punctuate every moment with some bizarre twist in order to maintain control. Naturally, the consequences are always painfully funny. I found this movie to be a lot like one of my favorite shows of all time Chris Elliot's GET A LIFE. In fact FGF could be considered the GET A LIFE movie. As director, Tom Greene surrounded himself with solid actors (especially Rip Torn), a great DP, a great editor and a truly ingenious music supervisor- nearly every scene has a complimentary song playing underneath which amps the comedy up to eleven. And he wisely chose to give these people free rein to ply their craft too, instead of taking the hands-on role of director too seriously. This marriage of off-the-wall and by-the-books pays off. Don't get me wrong, FREDDY GOT FINGERED is not perfect. But it is surprisingly engaging and at moments, poignant. We actually feel for Gordy despite ourselves (and him). And we almost understand him resorting to such desperate measures as accusing his father of fingering his younger brother, Freddy (in case you were wondering where the title came from), jacking off horses and cutting a newborn's umbilical cord with his teeth. Oddly, there don't seem to be any cases where the shocking humor seems forced. In Gordy's world it all makes sense. And as visitors to Gordy's world, it makes sense to us. When I saw that this movie only had a 3.9 rating I had to give it a 10. It's obviously been misunderstood, most likely by Tom Greene fans who got more traditional story than they wanted, and traditional story fans who got more Tom Greene than they wanted. Being neither a fan of Tom Greene nor traditional story, I was pleasantly surprised by FREDDY GOT FINGERED. Unlike most of the other films I have seen this year, it is the only one that felt like a one of a kind experience. And one that can never be duplicated, for better or worse.

As a matter of fact, that's why he cancelled his TV show. Too many people had begun to recognize him and he could no longer make them the butt of his jokes. But he had one last prank to play. And Freddy Got Fingered is it. Although it has some geniuinely funny scenes (especially the ones featuring Rip Torn) many scenes exist purely for their shock value. It is hard to sympathize with any of the characters in the film and it does get tedious. And this is precisely what Gteen had intended. FGF is Green's version of Kauffman's Great Gatsby bit. But for those of us who enjoy abstract humor, FGF is a godsend. The biggest joke is the fact that the film actually got made and somebody greenlighted this project. The film actually references this in the scene when Gordy presents his Zebra family idea to the producer. Just try to imagine Green pitching his idea to a bunch of suits who've probably never watched his TV show but know from their charts and graphs and statistics that the show is popular among young males.

Of course, these people are generally not critics' darlings, however few if any of their hackneyed, horribly successful films have received the reception that Tom Green's Freddy Got Fingered did in 2001. Roger Ebert no less was one of its most savage attackers, writing emphatically how it didn't 'scrape the bottom of the barrel' and that it didn't even 'deserve to be mentioned in the same sentence with barrels'.It is indeed a very polarising film; I concede that it's just an immature indulgence from Tom Green, but at least it's not a load of recycled tedium. It's quite remarkable that this film was financed at all, let alone by 20th Century Fox. What's even more surprising is that this is very much Tom Green's film, no executives interfered in the creative process; it is, for better or worse, the work of an auteur.The film focuses on Gord Brody, a 28-year-old animator/slacker living in his parents' basement. In the film's opening moments, Gord is seen strewn across his bed completely supine as he narrates one of his draft animations like a blithering idiot. He soon gets a job in a Los Angeles cheese sandwich factory while he tries to sell his work to an important animation executive.Green has an irreverent, dark and extreme sense of humour that he releases through his character Gord in a series of outrageous set pieces, most of which begin with or entirely comprise him shouting maniacally. It is Green's unhinged lunacy that makes the film so... different. Highlights include him violently handbrake turning as he is bowled over by the sight of a horse's penis, his horrifying misinterpretation of an advertising executive's advice, his impersonation of an obnoxious stock broker during a dinner with his new girlfriend and the many altercations with his father Jim (Rip Torn).Rip Torn's performance is a highlight of the film, he is brilliantly cantankerous and frequently clashes with his son, he is the perfect adversary for Green's proverbial slacker. He shows, quite understandably, no faith whatsoever in what he calls Gord's 'doodles'.I've personally always had a fondness for Freddy Got Fingered. Even for its admirers, it can indeed be a tough, tiring watch from beginning to end, I think it largely depends on what mood you're in. Once the viewer has endured what has become quite an infamous 1 hour and 23 minutes, it is a film that's best revisited as separate puerile set pieces rather than as a full narrative.But however you watch it, whether its by yourself with a cup of Earl Grey or with friends and much alcohol (a recommended method), it will ultimately always be funnier than Adam Sandler.50%www.hawkensian.com "},{"Title":"Wasted chance","Date":"10 April 2014","Score":"0 out of 3 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy","Review":" This is a strange movie.

He got half that statement right.Tom Green's humor is not necessarily funny what's on the screen so much as the absurd motivation behind the incidents, best example the restaurant scene where Green puts on exaggerated display of anger at a fancy restaurant just to prove to his girlfriend he's an important CEO of some company. My telling does no justice to this brilliantly composed scene.Plus Rip Torn is top notch as Tom Green's dad. But don't ever tell Tom Green how much you like this movie if you run into him.

From a purely cinematographic standpoint, the plot is nonexistent, the writing is terrible, and the direction is amateurish. It's an hour and a half (or whatever) of Tom Green flaunting the immaturity that made him a superstar. There's no prevailing meaning, message or story.Except one, which you get a certain sense of watching the movie with the commentary track. Watching the movie with an awareness of Green's career and the peculiar circumstances (a national penchant for inanity) under which he rose to cult iconic status, we can draw certain connections between his character's efforts at selling his idea for a cartoon and what must have been the story of Green's career convincing bigshots to, well, let him do whatever the hell he wants.This is just one interesting aspect of the film, which at least gives it a layer of -- well, something -- but by itself this implied allegory doesn't make the film brilliant. What does make it brilliant is its absolute, indefatigable audacity and disregard for everything that cinema is. It's one movie that doesn't try to be a movie, certainly doesn't make any attempts at being taken seriously, but not in a campy, cult this is funny cause it's not like other movies kinda way. It doesn't try to be a Rocky Horror Picture Show or a Wet Hot American Summer, whose appeal lies in their tongue-in-cheek, against-the-fray humor. Freddy Got Fingered just wants to kick your ass with absurdity. It's Tom Green showing that yes, flinging babies around still attached by the umbilical cord can be funny; yes, crawling inside a dead deer carcass can be funny - because there's no effort put forth for it to be *genuinely* funny; it's not presented as a joke contributive to the plot. It's ridiculousness for ridiculousness' sake.And it's f*&#$ing hilarious. You spend the entire film in utter hysterics (if you have the right sense of humor), and are never once upset that, no, this isn't a film at all, cause that's not what it's trying to be, and hopefully that's not what you were expecting.

The film centers about Gord Brody as he tries to fulfill his dreams as an animator while proving his family, especially his hard-leveled and unaffectionate father, that he is all grown-up-- although not without Green's trademark antics.There's no denying that it is filled with misbehaving stunts, gore and bestiality. Due to the film's vomit-inducing nature, it has been widely lauded by movie critics and entertainment columnists alike. It was even nominated for 8 and won 5 Razzie Awards.But before it gets another negative review, one must take a look again and watch it. One may find the scenes too gratuitous, while another may find it totally funny. Clearly, this isn't everyone's cup of tea, but both parties agree on this it's original and sickeningly surreal, so sickeningly surreal that the film shouldn't be taken too seriously by conventional films critics like (who else?) Robert Ebert.The film in itself defines the gross-out sub-genre of comedy even clearer than its precursors, and the fact that it was critically panned solidifies its gross status even more. And while it initially failed to receive fans, it has at least achieved something that it takes gross-out comedy to a bit more lighthearted perspective. Most surrealistic movies (like those of the legendary Mexican director Luis Bunuel) take their philosophy that might be too heavy for the average audience, and others take it too superficially that it turns out to be boring and unnecessary. But Green incorporated the story and the stunts very well to suit his fans and the young audience, making the film more entertaining to watch, thus gaining a fan base and a cult status.Freddy Got Fingered deserves a second look. While this isn't for cinematic snobs who take too much attention to the formulaic conventions of film-making, it is highly recommended for fans of Tom Green and the gross-out sub-genre, and those want a more extreme kind of entertainment. Besides, the film isn't made to receive an Oscar for Best Picture; rather it is meant to break the rules.

The film is very surrealist, and the inclusion of Rip Torn (Cat on a Hot Tin Roof), Julie Hagerty (Noises Off), and a cameo role from Lorena Gale (Smallville) gives it a remarkably interesting star power.The movie uses bombastic, exaggerated situational comedy to bring to light the grim Fruedian psycho-social issues that inherently exist within the familial rituals and tradition of our post-nuclear society, with regards to the social concept of family. As the film shows to prove, the nuclear family as it were is no longer fit to provide the everyperson, represented by Freddie, with the basics of human survival and evolution while nurturing the instinctual romantic idealisms of the individual, represented by Freddie's desire to draw, the basest and most symbolic form of artistic expression. This failure to provide is shown in conjunction with the demands and applications of control put forth by government and indeed all societal institutions as such demands become incongruous with the evolving reality that the long-abandoned agrarian societies which we still subconsciously adhere to no longer apply.I personally adore the Fancy Restaurant scene, which paints a stark expression (as the entire movie does, truthfully) on our society's cutthroat demands for the world of employment which as been thrust upon all individuals as an essential obligation. Also expressed in the scene is our modern society's misconception of social class in the true sense of the Marxist bourgeoisie archetype, and the mislead preconceptions held for an individual to improve upon their own status. I only wish the movie had delved a bit deeper into Freddie's job at the cheese sandwich shop as it would provide a grand opportunity to expose the harsh conundrums of the farce that is service-oriented employment.Freddie Got Fingered does all this as well as explores the gross realms of human instinct, and how what is natural becomes contradiction as it turns unnatural when compared to the expectations we hold as a society. The movie postulates that we as humans can barely comprehend our own natural impulses, and that perception lies somewhere beyond our own understanding as a flurry of seemingly disconnected events which we ourselves must attribute symbolic meaning towards, as expressed in the childbirth scene and the stud farm scene.All in all, the movie pokes fun at our society as it becomes more politically and economically dependent, all the while screaming at a brick wall for the senseless contradictions which permeate throughout our society. The movie's strength lies in weaving these themes so naturally into the fabric of the story of the limits of a man's role in the family.

I am a mature minded adult who's first viewing of this video was with that mind frame. This video has extremely vulgar subject matter and Tom Green intensely magnifies each awkward situation. Now that you can see that even a mature adult can get past the vulgarity of the film hopefully you will take this review seriously above the easily offended individuals who solely intend to slander this video. This video, although obscure and intensified through an adults perspective, captures a very believable story of hardship between a loser son and his productive/successful father. I feel that the artists magnification of the vulgar subject matter makes the story more intense and traumatic to adults watching the film and allows them to relate to the true pain and awkwardness of the main character. If you can get past the vulgarity I promise you this movie has many funny, non-vulgar moments and a solid story that most males can relate to the relationship they have with their own father.

It is one of the most annoying, atrocious and cinematically disturbing films I have seen in a long, long time. The humor is non-existent, and its MPAA rating is just as disturbing as the film. How this passed for an R-rating, instead of a solid X, is truly beyond me. And even further beyond me is how this film made its way into theaters, when it should be sitting in the bottom of a straight-to-video rack at Wal-Mart. Or better yet, it should be underneath the video rack, hidden from visibility.The plot involves a young, 28-year-old, hopeless drifter named Gord (Tom Green), who dreams of being a cartoonist. After he gets fired from his job, he moves back in with his father (Rip Torn) and mother (Julie Hagerty). After his father, who hates Gord--and rightly so--throws him out of the house, Gord begins to spread rumors that his father sexually abused his brother, Freddy, as a child. Somewhere in Tom Green's mind this was funny. But to the average human being, it just isn't.The so-called humor in Freddy Got Fingered--which I already mentioned is non-existent--is about as acceptable as I don't know what. It's truly horrific and sickening. In once scene, Gord visits his friend in a hospital, to find a woman in labor. He runs over, yanks the child out of the mother's womb, to find out it's dead. He then swings it above his head like a madman (and it looks like a little rag doll, mind you) and blood splatters the walls around him. He then hands the baby back to the mother. If you found that funny, then you're going to love Freddy Got Fingered. If you're like me, and not only find that humor revolting and disgusting, then do not, do not, do NOT see this movie, whatever you do.I heard Tom Green showed up to receive his Razzy Award for this film. That just goes to show the arrogance of some people--if I ever made a film as revolting as Freddy Got Fingered, I'd lock myself up for weeks upon end in a tiny little hole until I had learned my lesson. But, apparently, Tom Green still hasn't learned, as he continues to shove garbage our way.My advice to you is to ignore it.In the end, Freddy Got Fingered is one of the most disgusting, revolting, disturbing, wretched and downright uncomfortable cinematic experiences I've had in recent years.You have been warned.0/5 stars--I've never given a film so low a rating until now (mainly because I thought the minimum was 1), so I'm setting a new trend for myself--John Ulmer "},{"Title":"Above the heads of most","Date":"26 August 2005","Score":"105 out of 214 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy","Review":" I'll bet that the majority of people who express their hatred this film on the grounds that it is too vulgar had a jolly time sitting through movies like American Pie, Scary Movie, and all that deplorable garbage.Those films and their vulgarities were incredibly labored and insincere creations designed to pander to hateful stereotypes and equally petty repressed fears and desires of feeble-minded perverts and uneducated teenagers. However, though Freddy Got Fingered contains equal vulgarities, they exist not for their own sake but to serve a greater, dadaistic post-modern vision. This is evident in the structure of the film. Other gross-out comedies present their vulgarities with the sober convention, creating a pornographic aura that is shameful instead of funny. The lack of artistic direction in a sea of recycled inspiration never fails to create an uncomfortable confusion as to whether the vulgarities are serving the higher part of our minds that pertains to comedy or meant arouse a repressed sexual perversion (American Pie, for example).Freddy Got Fingered separates itself from such worthless trash by breaking free from convention and re-appropriating it. Rather than cold and unflinching eye with which hacks such as the Wayans brothers present their vulgarities, Freddy Got Fingered uses innovative editing to de-familiarize the audience to whatever on screen, such as incorporating Sam Peckinpah's pause-burst-pause technique in the restaurant scene, or the revolutionary cut from the bleeding child (Tommy) to a closeup of roast beef at an all-American family dinner. It should be mentioned that while Freddy Got Fingered is discussed for it's vulgarities, it makes a point of balancing shock with classical comedic conventions the majority of the gags in the film consist of non-sequiturs, slapstick, and satire (the main target being dramatic conventions in film, which is achieved through mixed-modalities rather than exploiting the ephemeral icons of pop-culture).The film's brilliant re-invention of comic film-making technique creates an intellectual framework that invites an oppositional reading to some of the vulgar content on screen. Freddy got Fingered is not a simple presentation of vulgarities, but rather in dialogue with them. The running gag of a child being injured is clearly a parody of the increasing darkness of comedy, and yet it is simultaneously a manifesto, in Tom Green's post-structuralist shattering of our perceptions of taste. It is this self-reflexive nature of the film that transcends its vulgarity, while other gross-out films not only fail to do this, but often fall one step lower by depending on extra-textual sources (again, usual ephemeral pop-culture icons).In conclusion, the equal magnitude of the vulgarities in relatively un-criticized movies such as American Pie and Scary Movie effectively invalidates the most critics' dismissal of the film on the grounds of excess vulgarity. The only difference between Freddy Got Fingered and its other gross-out counterparts is the film's original approach to film-making technique. However, I cannot imagine why this is more repugnant to them than the pornographic practice of using conventional film-making to enshrine vulgarities set before the camera (for example even Booty Call has an orchestral score). Perhaps by being the first mainstream film to elevate the lucrative gross-out comedy beyond the reach of formulaic film-making, many perceive Freddy Got Fingered as a threat to the tradition, despite the fact that it has liberated conventional film-making techniques from being subjected to vulgar subject matter, saving both from demeaning each other. More likely is the possibility that the structure of Freddy Got Fingered is so foreign to film-goers weaned on convention that they cannot get themselves comfortable enough to laugh. If they are so accustomed to convention, then they are also desensitized to it, which explains why they cannot see its presence in other vulgar comedies, and hence their unsettling perversion. In any scenario, Freddy Got Fingered has failed to garner the praise it deserves because people just can't bring themselves to take this sophisticated social-commentary post-modern manifesto at anything but face value. And that is shameful.

This film was generally disliked by critics and some reviewers and though i like this film i can see why other people wouldn't there's a lot of bizarre and shocking humour and there isn't really much of a fixed plot the vulgar title and the fact the film has actually won awards for being bad could also put some people who haven't yet seen it off. Though the film has the name Freddy in its title the film revolves around a man named Gord Brody whose actually Freddie's older and less successful brother, according to Gordy Freddy was molested by their father(the reason for the title) this probably didn't happen because both Freddie and their father strongly deny it. The one thing I didn't like about the film as the fact the protagonist's attitude keeps changing one minute he seems fairly sensible ad nice enough the next hes a complete simpleton and the next again hes a hysterical lunatic whose rather annoying to watch the other characters have similar changes to this as well. Gord has dreams of becoming an animator and clearly has talent for drawing unfortunately though he can't come up with a good premise for his drawings (the best one being about a cat who can see through wood). Gord attempts to make something of his drawings and when this doesn't work he returns to living with his parents(he's 28 years old) . Many other things happen in this film for example Gordy becomes the love interest of a wheelchair bound woman named Betty whose inventing a rocket powered wheelchair, he delivers a baby in a gross yet funny manner, pretends to be a stockbroker for a short time and eventually him and his father are held captive in a foreign country (no it doesn't make that much sense). This film as I mentioned earlier doesn't have a main story line and seems to switch from one thing to another in fact the only thing that links the events are the character(s) involved. This film provides plenty of laughs (mainly grossed out ones of course) and doesn't fail to be of entertainment. This film has plenty of memorable scenes too (arguably the best known and remembered is where Gordy designs a mechanism that has sausage connected to strings connected to a keyboard so every time he plays a note the sausages move above he chants daddy would you like some sausage while badly playing the keyboard) and has a few familiar faces including tom green(road trip, MTV's TOM GREEN SHOW) Rip Torn(Men in black,dodge ball) Eddie Kay Thomas (probably better known as finch from the American pie films) and a cameo appearance from Drew Barrymore(Charlie's angels,whip it). Though this film is fairly senseless and often disgusting its also very very funny(some hidden humour e.g at the end when Gord and his father are set free from where they were held captive if you will notice a man holding a banner saying when the f**k will this movie end but if you blink you@ll miss it) and entertaining. Recommended centrally to fans out gross out comedy or people who aren't easily disgusted or offended. "},{"Title":"Wow!

Normally when they do reach surrealism, such as cult comedy show Stella, they are strange but hilarious. This movie is in what must be a parallel universe where everyone is so insanely stupid and random, and this movie just hits everyone over the head with it's random idiocy. And this movie is not funny stupid...it's just stupid! At times it's shocking, and at times it may cause a few chuckles out of uncomfortability, but other than that, this thing has nothing to boast but some of the most disgusting acts ever seen on the silver screen.This thing doesn't really have much of a plot. The basic story is that Gordy (Tom Green) wants to become a famous animator by pitching his stupid cartoon idea to a big-shot in Hollywood. His father, Jim (Rip Torn) discourages him, Gordy forms a relationship with a paraplegic girl Betty (Marisa Coughlin) who claims to be an amateur rocket scientist, and gets into other wacky shenanigans. The plot is nonexistent really, and this thing is all over the place.It's not a big surprise to see that Tom Green directed and co-wrote this, as this seems like about his level of stupid humor. The character Gordy is the most disgustingly random character to ever appear in a movie...and I mean random...and I doubly mean disgusting!!! In the duration of this movie, this guy pleasures a few large mammals, licks a guy's protruding bone, cuts open and dances around inside a dead animal, eats an umbilical chord and many more strange, random and disgusting acts. Where this could have been funny, it's just not...it's odd, and it's shocking, but it elicits more Wow!'s than actual laughs. It's really just sick.The performances are how Tom Green wanted the performances I'm sure. Everyone shouts a lot and enjoys extremely stupid things and people do odd things just for the heck of it, and those odd things come up in the spur of the moment and are never mentioned again. Because of this, it's hard to rate the acting, because everyone just acts like Tom Green, so he did a fine job of portraying the world through his own eyes, with himself in every character. Unfortunately, every character is extremely annoying because of this, but obviously that's what he finds funny.Think about if someone you knew was comically hit in the crotch and then screamed, and this caused you to laugh. It was mildly funny, though a bit mean spirited. Now imagine 30 people surrounding you all being hit in the crotch and screaming, all at once, and for 80 plus minutes. You'd go insane, and that is a great equivalence for how it is watching this thing. It's nonstop screaming and strange random acts and bizarre dialogue that never quit. It's not really funny, it's mainly just tedious and going from scene to scene with no center grows quite boring. Only see this if you're a hard-core Tom Green fan, or if you feel like going comatose from stupidity.My rating 1/2 out of ****. 89 mins. R for strong sexual, crude and violent acts, and language.

Things start to change for Gord after he gets a crippled girlfriend and then accuses his father of molesting his youngest brother Freddy. If you think accusing your father of fingering your younger brother is vile then you'll probably be shocked to learn that it's actually one of the nicest things that happens in this movie. Many, many critics ripped Green to shreds when this movie was released because there are many vile things that happen. For example, at around the five-minute mark we see Green get out of his car, walk up to a horse with an erection and jerk it around. Towards the end of the movie he grabs an elephant's penis and shoots his father with its semen. Everything that happens in between just ranges from downright stupid to downright ignorant including one sequence where Green delivers a baby only to bite its umbilical cord and then slings the baby around by it. I don't mind a film that crosses the line in terms of humor but sadly this movie just isn't funny. I will admit that I did laugh at a few of the jokes but whenever you have ten jokes a minute and only one of them works you know you're watching something really bad. The story is downright stupid but then again so was The Tom Green Show yet it was very funny. I think what really went wrong here is that Green let himself do the directing. Now, I'm not saying a better director would have turned this into a classic but I think someone who knew how to structure a movie and knew something about comic timing might have been able to make more of the jokes work. Even half of the jokes working would have made for a much less painful film to view. At around the one-hour mark the film pretty much hits a wall and going through the rest of it becomes quite hard. Green, at least tries to give a performance. Torn gives it his all and manages to be wacky to say the least. I wouldn't say he was good in the part but he certainly goes all out and isn't worried about being embarrassed. Hagerty is wasted in a worthless part as is Green's then girlfriend Drew Barrymore who shows up in a couple scenes. FREDDY GOT FINGERED contains some very dirty humor that's going to offend most people but to me the only offensive stuff is how unfunny it all was.
