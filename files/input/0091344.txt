King Kong is brought back to life and sets about romancing a female giant ape while squashing nasty humans. I had a great time cheering for Kong while watching this. It's hard not too cheer for him since he's such a lovable lug. My heart really went out to him at times. At other times I just couldn't stop laughing!

Of all the wonderful stories that could be told using the most famous movie ape of all time, screenwriter Ronald Shusset (Alien, Dead and Buried) opts for a ludicrous tale about an overly involved scientist/doctor/biologist Hamilton and her emotional quest to save Kong.

A decade after our hero fell from the World Trade Center to his death, the big ape receives a heart transplant from a giant female gorilla of the same species, Lady Kong, who he falls in love with. The first time I heard this idea I figured this movie would suck and just be two guys in gorilla suits romancing over each other. But having loved its predecessor I had to check out this truly unique film. Unlike the rest of the Kong series this is more like a popcorn film that is here strictly to entertain us and isn't as deep as the previous films. Another kool thing is that Kong doesn't fall in love with a human girl (like every other Kong movie) but with an equal size girl ape which is, I think, a tremendous idea. Linda Hamilton (who I've always loved from the Terminator series) almost plays the same character she played from Dante's Peak and is responsible for Kong's blood transfusion. She is a great actress and came out of this movie OK. Indiana Jones wannabe Brian Kerwin plays her love interest and is also responsible for Kong's rebirth upon capturing Lady Kong. He does a superb job as well. The army is constantly causing problems for the ape couple but our two heroes (Hamilton and Kerwin) successfully stop them and near the end the two big apes have a Baby Kong (possibly setting up for another sequel). Yes this movie could have been called Bride of Kong and had a lot of high quality action scenes, some of which are actually quite gory for a Kong film (heads being bit off, people being tore in half, rubber alligators being chewed up) and seems a lot like a Godzilla film. Sure the plot gets a little silly and having two giant gorillas cuddle each other and act like humans is a bit much, but all the cheesy scenes are mediocre at best. And yes I did hate some of it, mostly the army scenes and the rubber alligator scene (really bad FX there) but being the sixth film in the Kong series, what more do you want? Seeing Kong smash stuff will make me happy. I now have this film in my Kong DVD collection along with King Kong '33, Son of Kong, and King Kong '76 (the two Japanese films will join them soon), I even have Might Joe Young though I don't count that as part of the series. I have now reviewed all the Kong films except the brand new 2005 remake which i simply can't wait to see. Review for that coming soon! Overall, I really enjoyed this film and it wasn't as bad as I expected nor as bad as people say. I give this worthy entry to the Kong series and great sequel to the 70's movie a 6/10.

Jump to 'Atlanta Institute, Georgia Ten Years Later' where they have Kong (Peter Elliott) on a life support system waiting to undergo a heart transplant(!). Dr. Amy Franklin (Linda Hamilton) is ready to perform the operation but Kong needs a steady supply of blood to survive the procedure, as luck would have it diamond mercenary Hank Mitchell (Brian Kerwin) has found a lady Kong (George Yiasoumi) while trekking through the Borneo jungle. In no time whatsoever the institute has brought the female & the operation has taken place with the artificial heart going in nicely. The operation is a success & Kong lives, the institute decides to keep both Gorillas but when Kong hears the female call out he uses all his strength to break free from his chains & go in search of a mate, obviously the United States Army can't have giant apes running around can they so it's up to Colonel Nevitt (John Ashton) to capture them by whatever means necessary...Directed by John Guillermin &, according to the IMDb an uncredited Charles McCracken, this is the sequel to the '76 remake of King Kong which Guillermin also directed. In my humble opinion I think King Kong Lives is one of those so-bad-it's-good abominations that I simply can't believe someone green lighted & trust me King Kong Lives is a bad film through & through. The script by Roland Shusett & Steven Pressfield is absolutely hilarious at times, you won't know weather to laugh or cry at some of the stuff that makes it's way into this film. I think King Kong Lives is meant to be a serious film but scenes such as the heart transplant complete with massive over-sized medical instruments, the giant artificial heart that needs to be lowered into Kong's chest using a crane(!) & all filmed in complete seriousness, there's a bit when Kong manages to 'sneak' up behind an entire platoon of soldiers, for Christs sake Kong is a 50 foot Gorilla couldn't any of these dumb soldiers see him? The scenes in which Kong & Lady Kong romanticise with hugs, 'I love you' type looks & Kong wanting to give her something so he uproots a bunch of trees & tries to give her those! The entire concept is bizarre, daft & just complete total & utter nonsense while at times it becomes embarrassing to watch. But having said that it moves along like a rocket & is never dull or boring, when all said & done I found King Kong Lives to be a throughly entertaining film for all the wrong reasons.Director Guillermin messes everything up, there is no excitement, scares, tension or any action although it is quite funny on numerous occasions. The whole mood of the film is wrong considering just how stupid it is. There are a few snippets of violence & gore, Kong's removed heart, someone is snapped in two, Kong eats someone as well as a load of crocodiles & he gets shot at the end.With a supposed budget of over $30,000,000 King Kong Lives is a travesty, where did all the money go? The special effects are worse than the '76 version in my opinion because of the 10 year gap, didn't special effects move on at all during that period? If you put King Kong '76 & King Kong Lives side-by-side you would think not. It really is just a man in a rubber monkey suit from beginning to end, the full size hand & arm shots are awful as they just look so stiff & unnatural. For 30 big ones King Kong Lives is a shoddily produced film & doesn't look the part at all. The acting is about as good as you would expect from such a silly film, I wonder if the cast knew how bad this was going to turn out to be?King Kong Lives provides 100 odd minutes of pure entertainment for me, it's a crap film but it's just so bad it's good. It's a bit like a train wreck, you know you shouldn't look but you can't take your eyes off it. An absolute treat for bad film fans!

But things go awry when adventurer Hank Mitch Mitchell captures a giant female gorilla and brought her in the institution so her blood can be used for the operation. The transfusion and the heart transplant are a success, but King Kong escapes along with the female ape creates havoc and destruction into the place.After a fair remake in 1976,the sequel becomes one bad movie.It was truly a disaster as the screenplay was thinly written,the characters lack depth,the special effects were mediocre and it was boring from beginning to end.Added to that,we also have a dull cast that had a forgettable performance and the ape even looks bored rather than scary while wreaking havoc and fighting the military.

A sequel virtually no-one requested to the 1976 remake, (of which I've only seen snippets) this is one of the oddest films I since for a while. It stars Linda Hamilton of Terminator fame, John Ashton as a mad general and a whole bunch of other people you haven't heard of. The plot is (as the title suggests) that Kong, even after falling off the Twin Towers a decade ago, isn't actually dead. He has been kept alive all this time, using a device to keep his circulation going by a government lab, but now he desperately needs a heart transplant otherwise he will buy the farm. We need a miracle proclaims Hamilton's surgeon character.WELL WHAT DO YOU KNOW at that exact moment, a fortune hunter (played by Brian Kerwin) is on some remote desert island when he is chased by.. you guessed it.. another giant primate (not John Prescott). This one though, is a SHE and even more fortunately, Kerwin has his backing chorus of tribesmen to knock her out with many blow-darts. Gosh, if it's that easy to take down those pesky apes, why doesn't every trooper carry one?! No matter, the Indy wannabe flies Ms Monkey to the States, where he gives the creature to the lab for a wad of cash. An operation then takes place, where half the heart of Lady Kong is removed and given to K. Kong.It turns out to be a success, and now there are two big animal attractions in the USA. HURRAY! Sadly, those stoopid scientists have placed the female too close to the male, and once Mr Kong gets a whiff of those pheromones, you can bet your blue baboon butt he's away... busting out of his cage that's protected by one (1!) guard, and going on the rampage till he finds the love of his life. And it's at this point I'd like to pause, reflect.. and ask a few questions if you don't mind, sonny Jim.1. Why bother spending millions of dollars keeping this big lunk alive for years, only to try and kill it the moment it gets better? They don't even attempt to knock him out when he escapes, they just whip out the ol' tanks and guns, and try and turn the animal into a very fetching black rug.2. Why entrust Lady Kong's care to an insane cigar chomping, warmongering general who couldn't care less about the creatures and would like nothing more than to slaughter them both? PETA's missing presence in this film is a giant question mark.3. Why does everyone attack and torture these docile animals, when it's already been proved in the original that they only fight back in self-defence? Give them a couple of bananas and they'll be your best friend, no need for all the artillery!4. Later, Hamilton and Kerwin find out Kong's mate is pregnant. This is an amazing development for arguably the rarest species in the word. What do they do with this information. Why, they tell The Insane General (see 2) who has already demonstrated his utter contempt for these primate pests! How about, going to the president or the FBI? Not in this mad movie!5. Most amazingly of all, every single shot from Uncle Sam's boys misses Mr and Mrs Kong, even at point blank range! And we're talking about the biggest targets EVER here! The only time they connect is at the end, during a 'noble sacrifice' YAWN. I hope the real American army isn't this inept, or you may as well surrender to China and Iran now!And so on, and so forth. About from all the implausibilities in the plot, the most painful moments are the romantic scenes between the apes, complete with goo-goo faces and slushy melodies in the background. HELLO THIS IS KING KONG AND LADY KONG, NOT TOM HANKS AND MEG RYAN. My favourite bit though, is in during one of these little trysts, when Hamilton is subtly enchanted enough after watching them to offer Kerwin a spot in her sleeping bag  Are you sure about this?! He asks. She replies with the quote of the century WELL WE'RE PRIMATES TOO!! Expect that to rank with lines from Citizen Kane and Casablanca in the all time greatest list.The special effects aren't half bad for the 80's, as long as you can pretend you're not looking at two boiling actors in gorilla suits. I hope they had ventilation! Of course if you're expecting something along the lines of Peter Jackson's 2005 interpretation of the character you're beating your chest at the wrong film. I will say this for it though.. it is diverting a lot of the time, not just because there's so much going on, but sometimes it just gets so silly you have to stop and rub your eyes. I can't really recommend it as an action film, but as a comedy when you've had a few bevvies and you've got the lads around it fits the bill perfectly. On that basis, I would give it a 4/10.. now I've got to go. Something big's just stepped on my dad's car! HE'S GONNA KILL ME!!

His heart is quickly going back so he needs a mechanical heart installed. Before the doctor (Linda Hamilton) does this, Kong is going to need blood so thankfully there's a redneck hunter (Peter Elliott) who has captured a female Kong. This movie has the reputation of being one of the worst ever made and people must have believed it because they stayed away from the film when it was originally released and it turned into one of the biggest box office disasters in history. This was a favorite of mine when I was a kid but it really hasn't aged too well. The biggest problem with the film is the film itself because it's never quite clear what the movie is trying to do. The story is all over the place, characters are coming in left and right and the entire Army set up just doesn't make too much sense at all. I'm going to take a wild guess and say this movie was meant for romance because we've got Hamilton and Elliott falling for each other and we've got the two Kong's falling in love. There's no doubt this is a very stupid movie but thankfully it's dumb enough to be mildly entertaining. The scenes with the two Kong's falling in love are pretty funny as is a scene later in the movie where redneck hunters trap Kong and try to torture him. The ending is just as wild as anything that follows it and I must admit that I found it pretty cute and touching. The special effects are certainly several notches below the previous film but they aren't too bad. Elliott and Hamilton really don't have too much to do because the screenplay doesn't offer them much but both are fine in their roles. What really kills the film from being a true cult item is the fact that we've got a 75-minute story expanded to 105-minutes, which is way too long.

My story had a similar type of resurrection to the one that is used in this movie but from there it changed sharply. The only way I could figure to make a sequel to Kong was to include a strong element of satire (which was, to some degree, in the 1976 film as well)and I also wanted to do a bit of a homage to the Japanese monster movies (like Godzilla and even the original King Kong). They went in a different direction-a horrible different direction.King Kong Lives has a cheesy charm but the actors look like they are trapped in a film and looking for a way out. It seems Kong didn't die when he fell from the Twin Towers (wow, that's a miracle!); he's in a coma, needs a new heart (yep, they have a giant mechanical heart but Kong needs plasma--of course they find a Lady Kong for a blood transfusion and Kong, naturally, has big ape sex with the lady. Aside from setting up the potential for a family franchise (which didn't happen--Lives was a big flop), the ending could only have come from Dino (RIP)who dreamed big even if sometimes big wasn't better.I didn't see King Kong Lives until years after it was released (I had no desire really--it sounded kind of dumb)but when I finally did I couldn't believe how bad the film was. Luckily, the writer of this film went on to bigger, better and bolder things (Steven Pressfield who penned the script for Above the Law and the novel The Legend of Bagger Vance)but it seemed like this was a career ender for the director John Guillerman.For a chuckle you could watch King Kong Lives and you'll realize that what really lives in this film is the spirit of 50's cheesy B-movies on an A budget.

The story is really off the wall as a female Kong is found and the old King Kong is revived with a fake heart of all things. Kind of a waste of millions of dollars to make a giant fake heart for a giant gorilla that for all purposes should be dead. Linda Hamilton plays the strange and mentally challenged person who makes the heart for the gorilla that can cause major damage if revived and since she is in it I am giving it one more star than I would have otherwise. That and the scenes of King Kong in a bloody mess are rather good too. However, the ending is just really lame and the special effects cheapness really shine through near the end of this piece.

I did not have enough time to go and critique at IMDb because I was busy. So here it is, KING KONG LIVES. It all started in 1976 when Dino De Laurentiis, announced to sequel to follow his remake, THE BIONIC KONG and KING KONG IN Africa (a.k.a. KING KONG GOES TO Africa). In the late seventies, they ended up announcing that their next official sequel was going to be KING KONG IN Africa where Kong gets resurrected Frankenstein-style and works for bad guys (similar to KING KONG ESCAPES, which is reviewed by me). It also says that Jack Prescott and Dwan make a return and Dwan tries to refresh Kong's memory, but instead he eats her up! Later the script was changed to KING KONG IN MOSCOW, but that didn't get made. So they decided to make a crossover movie where his giant ape fights his killer whale in KING KONG VS.ORCA. That would be a great spectacle than this piece of trash, but they ended up making this instead. I remember KING KONG LIVES when I was a kid. I thought this was fun, but it took me a while to realize how bad this film was, and little me tell you, this film was bad with a capital B! Somehow, this film, akin to the 1976 remake was a frequently rented/borrowed/watched movie. Why? Because it is the only good thing in various video libraries. It was the only monster movie (apart from the 1976 film) that had a PG to PG-13 rating. Back then most monster movies from the 80's and 90's carried R-ratings. Another reason, is because that monster movies are kids stuff vs. monster movies are not for kids kind of situation is going around. I was longing to see the 1976 remake until I was 15, but that's another story. How dumb could those people be to have this ape resurrected because there is not enough blood for him. How did Lady Kong (who had such a grating roar) get in the picture, did Brian Kerwin read about her in Jack Prescott's book Ape Myths and Legends? It is still a stupid idea to resurrect the ape and bring back another one. Then these two would destroy go wild. Kong's roar sounded like as if Frank Welker did it. Here's a fact, Peter Cullen (you might know him as the voice of Optimis Prime in the original TRANSFORMERS series), provided the vocal effects for King Kong in the 1976 remake, but blood started coming out of his mouth and was rushed to a hospital. It was funny to see Kong eat up people because I was used to seeing cartoon characters get eaten up by monsters. The film apes (no pun intended) KONGA, ESCAPE FROM THE PLANET OF THE APES and MIGHTY JOE YOUNG. The ending also copies SPARTACUS. After that movie, why not make a sequel. They did...NOT! Well they were originally going to do a third one called SON OF KONG where the little baby Kong grows up to be teenaged and falls for this blond mountain climber. Achilles Heel He's got vertigo. So he follows the girl to Paris. There, she is kidnapped by terrorists and she is with one of the many hostages up in the Eiffel Tower. It's the Son of Kong to the rescue where he conquers his fear of heights and fights the terrorists. It is a good thing that never got made, because every James Rolfe (of ANGRY VIDEO GAME NERD FAME) and Doug Walker (of NOSTALGIA CRITIC fame) would go bananas. So there you have it. What's the moral of the story? Do not mess around with mother nature and stay away from this movie! Because it wouldn't hurt to think outside the box.

By 'doom' I meant sequel without most of the main cast of the first movie returning. Instead the audience get groom for a new cast of people. King Kong is being treated up and kept in a coma for the last 10 years for some odd reason despite him killing people and damaging parts of New York in the last movie. Surgeon Dr. Amy Franklin (Linda Hamilton) for a science reason not explains wants King Kong alive so she must perform a heart transplant and give Kong a computer-monitored artificial heart. However, she needs Kong blood to pump it. Adventurer Dr. Livingston Rip off Hank Mitchell (Brian Kerwin), just capture a giant female gorilla for plot calls for it and brings her to the Atlantic Institute where King Kong is kept. The transfusion and the heart transplant are a success, but Kong escapes along with the female with Hank's help. Hank is willing to kill US soldiers to protect two beasts from getting killed and risking normal Americans live with allowing two giants apes to go loose in the country side is stupid. The two apes escape to Honey Moon Ridge as the film really trying too hard to get the audience interested in disturbing animal love making. Those close ups on the two big apes falling in love was painfully to watch and cheesy. Kong destroys the natural habitation of the swamp by feeding on the whole alligator population. Somehow, baby alligators are able to turn into crocodiles when close up on him holding their in his hand. Archie Nevitt (John Ashton), an insane army lieutenant colonel, is called in with his men to hunt down and kill the two apes. He's very stereotype Pattonism. Stupid redneck hunters are sent to kill him as well in stereotype fashion. While the redneck fail, Lady Kong is captured alive by Nevitt's troops and imprisoned; Kong falls from a cliff and is presumed dead in the water, but soon returns to rescue his mate. After being attacked, and shot by the military. Kong kills the military colonel and dies slowly at a military base. After this event, Lady Kong is back on Kong Island for unknown reason with her newborn son whom King Kong was able to see and touch before his death. However, the film rarely points out that Lady Kong was even pregnant leaving the question when did Baby Kong came to conception during the short period of time spent together. If Kong had sex with Female Kong in Honey Moon Ridge, how was them able to live out on their own for nine months. If Kong had sex with her in Skull Island, how come it took her 10 years to give birth? However, these questions will never be answer as a trilogy of movies were supposed to answer these questions was canceled due to budget restriction. Plus half the cast was either unable to return, or they simply didn't want to. The movie was bad. The men in the Kong suits were different in shape, color and size with each different frame of movie. People repeat the same mistakes in the last movie in this movie. The plot is predictable like all the Kong's movies. Stop making King Kong movies! The 1933 King Kong should be the only Kong movie out there. That's the only one that's OK.

While schlock directors like Ed Wood, Arch Hall and Al Adamson can make really bad films, their budgets are minuscule. Here, however, with a big budget the producers show that they can produce a film every bit as bad. That's a great great return on your money, folks! This is also one of those films whose concept is so bizarre and dumb you wonder how it ever got made in the first place. First, considering how much of an enormous box office bomb the previous version of KING KONG was, you'd be amazed to see this this is a sequel! Second, the entire idea just makes no sense at all. This sequel begins as you see Kong falling to his death at the end of KING KONG (1976). But, despite falling a bazillion stories AND being machine gunned repeatedly, KING KONG LIVES expects us to accept that the giant ape DID NOT DIE!!! And, here's the weirdest part folks, some evil rich guy has been paying to keep the ape on life support in a warehouse for a decade!!! Why?!? This NEVER is explored in the least. And, after the nasty simian destroys New York, this guy has the idea of trying to revive this beast!?!In contrast to the evil industrialist (and aren't they all in these sort of films?!), you have the dedicated people (the doctor who saved Kong and the man who discovered a female Kong) who want to save the ape and return it to the wild--sort of like that kid from ET. And, when the military comes into the film, you KNOW that they are evil and only want to kill. So, it's the two innocent idiots who have to battle the unfeeling idiots who want to kill Kong and his new lady love (yes, folks, there are now TWO giant apes in this film). So, despite Linda Hamilton (who really seems to have a thing for big hairy guys) and some other jerk armed only with pluck, they are able to sneak past a bazillion idiot soldiers and the forces of the evil idiot rich dude...and save the day. In the process, the cars and trucks of the evil rich dude inexplicably run into each other and instantly explode in flames--thus enabling the apes and the only two who understand and care to escape. One of my favorite awful scenes was right after this when the male and female apes escape. They are now in the wild and are at a place called Honeymoon Ridge--at which place, naturally, the now adorable aminals start cooing and falling in love! Oh, this is stupid and I couldn't help but groan...and laugh. And, when the two ape-lovers happen upon them, guy what happens next?! Yes, they, too, are smitten and inspired by the apes' pure and innocent love! A short time later, the evil military mess up this perfect love and manage to gas the female ape to sleep. This works very, very well. So, when Kong shows up a minute later, they barely even try to put him to sleep as well but throw bombs and stuff at him--and really ticking him off in the process. Why didn't they also just put Kong to sleep as well and transport them to a sanctuary or a zoo or to Disney's Animal Kingdom?! So, given that the two lovers are separated, is what happens next really much of a surprise?! However, I was surprised to see that Kong survived by hiding out and eating alligators--and later, even people. The ape appears to be a giant gorilla--and gorillas are vegetarians. Also, the forest where Kong and Mrs. Kong hied out appears to be some place like Idaho or Colorado. Which begs the question what are giant rubber alligators doing in this part of the United States?!?.Now I noticed that this movie won a Razzie award for its special effects and I actually think this is unfair. The ape suits were not that bad and the special effects are actually the best thing about this terrible film. I do agree with the Razzie book (which I own) that it is a great movie to see because it is so laughably bad, but the award seemed misplaced. To have given an award for writing, directing or even acting would have seemed a lot more appropriate because of the silly lovemaking that occurred between the apes--now THAT was dumb! But the costumes weren't that bad for 1986 (other than Baby Kong's--whose was truly terrible). Also, in the film's defense, while the film was 100% stupid, it looked good--with good camera-work and decent effects. But, at heart, despite this, it was still incredibly dumb. And, speaking of the love of two apes, apparently the two apes can meet, have sex and have a baby all in the space of a day or two. Wow, those giant apes work fast!! And, with no amniotic fluid, placenta or mess whatsoever!! And, oddly, the baby turns out to be about the size of a normal gorilla--making me wonder who the father REALLY was!!! Apparently, Mrs. Kong was quite the slut! By the way, apparently the people inside the Mr. and Mrs. Kong's outfits were both guys. This makes the amazing childbirth scene all the more amazing!!!Oh, and the only good scene in the entire dreadful film involves Kong ripping some dumb redneck in half and then eat another. It's dumb but kinda cool as well. Although, it's pretty sad if this is the BEST thing the film has to offer! It's also interesting because the ape only appears to eat bad people--despite man chances to eat others, it only eats these rednecks who deserved it! "},{"Title":"Horrendous trash!

But no matter. The Kongs have become a family of epic grinners, you just have to deal with it. The scariest thing is that that's not even the worst part of this movie. It is dangerous ground to make a sequel that involves a movie monster getting romantically involved. They did it with Child's Play and it transformed the early camp horror films into pure comedy. Child's Play was no longer even in the same genre as it started out in. King Kong Lives doesn't even deserve to be in the same GENRE, even of the 1976 film, which was very well made, much less the 1933 classic.The movie opens with the ending of the 1976 film, with Kong climbing and being shot down from the World Trade Center. This movie (surprise) takes place ten years later. I guess Kong has been in some sort of coma for ten years, and as the movie starts a lot of scientists are in the process of performing a heart transplant on him. Next thing you know, he's ripping electrodes off and jumping up for the windows in the roof, then lifting himself up bodily by the bars on those windows despite just having had his rib cage sawn open and a plastic heart the size of a Volkswagen installed.Now, this was hard, but I managed to accept that he was able to do that. I know virtually nothing about primates, much less 50 foot tall primates. Who am I to judge his healing speed? But given that I had accepted his remarkable ability to recover from a barrage of anti-aircraft gunshot wounds from helicopters on all sides, then a fall that would have reduced all of his organs to mush, then a historic heart transplant, and THEN display a miraculous mending of the sternum, I found it more than a little odd how easily he was undone when he bumped his head on a rock later in the movie. One clever individual in the film tries to convince Amy (Linda Hamilton) to just forget about him because outside his environment, he would not be able to acquire enough protein to survive.PROTEIN!!Nevermind the fact that there's a 10,000-pound gorilla corpse floating downriver, let's just go home because he won't be able to find enough protein to survive! That's OUTSTANDING science, my friend! Then again, the Kongs have not only found love, but they have mastered the art of invisibility, so it's not surprising that he didn't want to be bothered with a search. The Kongs are like freaking ninjas!At the beginning, Hank, the big game hunter that some nutcase refers to as Indiana Jones, lays down on some foliage to take a nap, not noticing that there is a 50 foot gorilla less than 20 feet away from him until she tries to pick him up. This guy is no Indiana Jones. Later in the film, some golfer hits King Kong in the face with a golf ball before he notices that there's a gigantic gorilla standing on the course. I'm guessing he wasn't looking where he was hitting the ball.Yes. It's true.King Kong.Gets hit.With a golf ball.It is odd indeed that it necessitates an entire army of troops, tanks, and helicopters to find King Kong and Mrs. Kong, who one guy in a helicopter with a searchlight could easily find since they tower over the trees. And you guessed it, Kong manages to sneak up on the entire Army, too. While they're standing watch. Looking for King Kong. Nice work, soldiers. These guys are dumber than the law enforcement in First Blood.At one point a lot of rednecks get into boats to go hunt down Kong, and some military jerk goes, What is this, Deliverance? No, sir. The rednecks were in the woods in Deliverance, not the boats. This is far worse, this is Gator Bait!And Hank, the golfers, and the military are not the only people suffering from vision loss in the movie. At one point Amy nearly falls over a waterfall while she and Hank are walking across a rickety wooden bridge (in a sad, sad homage to the Temple of Doom), and when she gets back up she frantically asks, Where's the heart rate monitor?? Apparently unable to see its bulky mass sitting two feet away from her. Somebody get this woman some binoculars!The movie almost gets meaningful when Kong is frantic to get out of captivity and get to the female that he can smell nearby. Forget about any stupid sex jokes, any ape is going to want to mate after being held in captivity. Then it turns out that they just want to go lounge in the woods grabassing and massaging each other. At one point Mighty Jane Young starts licking a wound Kong has somehow gotten on his knee, and he puts his arm around her and grins. The only thing missing is a barrel of beer in his other hand.Ultimately, of course, we are forced to meet Son of Kong, a human-sized ape which, having come from Mrs. Kong, makes about as much sense as a human woman giving birth to a child the size of like, a grape.In the movie's defense, we do get to see Linda Hamilton topless for exactly two fifteenths of a second, but director John Guillermin, who also directed the massively superior 1976 remake, has not even managed to produce a grape.He's given birth to a raisin.A rotten one.

It's my file photo for God's sake. But not killing Kong off after what he had been through for Ann was just unacceptable. May I remind you that Kong just fell off the World Trade Center (Yes, in the 1976 version Kong falls off the Twin Towers)? Kong spends 10 years in hospital and ends up surviving after a blood transplant from a female ape. So the race is on for America to capture Kong and his new bride. This movie features terrible ape costumes (Probably Peter Elliot as Kong). Well that is what you get when you keep a fictional gorilla going on for way to long. So if you like weird spin offs like 'Greystoke The Legend Of Tarzan' then this movie is for you!

It is therefore something of a surprise that the same producer and director returned to the story for this sequel in 1986; alas, they seriously needn't have bothered. Few films can match the idiocy of King Kong Lives, with its lame-brained science, endless logic lapses, absurd dialogue and silly plot developments. It is a film which actually seems to show contempt towards its own audience. 'We think you're a bunch of dummies', the film is saying to viewers, 'and we're gonna treat you exactly as dummies deserve to be treated!' Unfortunately for the makers, audiences didn't want to be treated with such brazen disregard and were quick to reject the film; meanwhile the critics had a field-day all over again ripping the film to shreds.Starting with a recap of the climax of the 1976 film, we once more see the mighty Kong fall from the World Trade Centre to his death far below. But wait! No! He is not dead, just severely injured&#x85; and ten years later we catch up with the giant ape, comatose in a research facility where a team of scientists work round the clock to keep him alive. Feisty doctor Amy Franklin (Linda Hamilton) desperately wants to help Kong by giving him a blood transfusion but cannot find a suitable blood match for such a unique beast. Only one thing can save Kong now; a miracle! she laments. And a miracle is what she gets when American adventurer Hank Mitchell (Brian Kerwin) comes across a female Kong in the jungles of Borneo. The lady Kong is brought to America and her blood used to revive her male counterpart&#x85; but disaster strikes when both apes, horny and angry, escape from the research facility and flee into the neighbouring mountains. Obsessive soldier Lt.-Col R.T. Nevitt (John Ashton) pursues the giant beasts but, despite clear orders to bring them back alive, his overwhelming desire is to kill the runaway creatures&#x85; There's really little more to be said about King Kong Lives. It's yet another film which proves that Linda Hamilton has little-to-no star attraction away from The Terminator movies; plus it makes thorough fools of Brian Kerwin and John Ashton (the latter particularly absurd as a military zealot). Its special effects are generally laughable, its occasional touches of comedy woefully misjudged. In one notably silly scene a golfer hits a perfect drive only for his ball to strike Kong on the forehead as he emerges from the trees &#x96; there follows a dull 'clonk' followed by an enraged roar from Kong. When the mighty Kong is reduced to being the butt of slapstick golf course pratfalls, you know you're in dire trouble. And so is the film. Avoid. "},{"Title":"WtH is this?

I am at a total loss for what to say about this flick. I was totally amazed that Linda Hamilton had anything whatsoever to do with such a disappointing jaunt into the area of camp. The critics have knocked the '76 remake of King Kong, but next to this, it was of Ben Hur caliber. This is one of those movies you would be far better off not seeing. Especially if you are a fan of the original OR the '76 remake. It is a farce. A joke. A very bad joke.It turns out Kong did not die at the end of the '76 remake. He was taken to the Institute, where Linda Hamilton and her team of doctors and scientists, primatologists and whatnot revived his heart and have tried for ten years to come up with a solution to his ten year long coma. Well, it seems he needs a heart transplant and blood transfusion, and the only source just happens to be available. A female Kong who is recently captured. Go figure. Upon acquiring the female, they give Kong the transfusion, perform the necessary operations and poof! Kong has a new heart. Trouble is, from a mile away, he can smell the female now that he is awake. So of course he makes trouble, escapes and finds her and together they run off into the mountains to make babies. With an historically inane story line, trite-filled dialog (It's the other monkey! It's gone...apesh*t!!), pure camp throughout, horrid cinematography, worse acting, and about the most poorly-done effects I've seen since Killer Klowns from Outer Space, this quondam legendary line of movies has reached its end with King Kong Lives.This is a prime example of a bad idea, gone worse. This should be required viewing in any cinema course What NOT to do with Your Movie 101. *sighs* 1.2/10 from...The Fiend ..

At least King Kong Lives goes by the rules.There is a flashback or two to the 1976 remake of the original,  which is fine by me (LOVED that one) but then they ruin everything and continue the story where it last left off.I give away nothing by saying that scientists resurrect the King of the monkeys (Heck, the TITLE gives that away!); they even give him an artificial heart!  And soon Kong is back in fighting shape, ravaging the Army, demolishing cars with one stomp and sharing screen time with luminaries like Hamilton, Kerwin, Ashton and Hope Nunnery - okay, Hope Nunnery isn't TECHNICALLY a luminary, but I like her name.But everything here is so slap-dash, so forced and so disjointed that it falls apart LONG before we discover that Kong has found a new girlfriend.  If you make it that far, you deserve every scene with these two to follow, especially the very last one.At least the FX are fairly decent; they're headed by E.T.'s Carlo Rambaldi and are a darn sight better than what he passed off as FX in Dune.   In closing all else I can say is, in seeing that Guillermin also directed this sequel to his '76 classic, it doesn't matter who you are - sequel-itis will get you if you don't watch out.One star.

It's a preposterous set up for a film which is a slap in the face to the original 1933 masterpiece. Guillermin plays much of it for laughs but there's a lethargic pace to the movie undermining his efforts. Even the cast looks bored.

A bad costume is only interesting or amusing if it is surrounded by something interesting.Some people seem to like it though.There certainly is a way to enjoy it for people who get a kick out of spotting how things go wrong in some films, but overall I found it kind of depressing even though I enjoy bad movies. There was no imagination in how it was filmed nor did it have any sense of fun, it was.... not fun. It is boring. "}]
