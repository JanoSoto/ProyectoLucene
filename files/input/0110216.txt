That's about it.  The premise is ridiculous, the twists and turns in the plot are mind-bogglingly stupid and every joke is predictable and hammered at you--but I still like this film!  The script does have it's moments, but the performances really carry this one.Arnie is suprisingly very funny when he becomes pregnant (when asks DeVito in all seriousness Does my body disgust you? I broke up); DeVito is just along for the ride but is good--he's the straight man to Arnie;  Emma Thompson is just gorgeous, very funny and full of life as a clumsy scientist.  Also Judy Collins (yes, the singer) pops up looking radiant as the head of a center for pregnant women.  Everything looks wonderful and the film is slickly made to cater the the audience.  I usually hate films like that, but this worked.  The only bad part is Pamela Reed--she's a wonderful actress and comediene but she's shamefully underused--she doesn't get any good funny scenes till the end.  Also, where else will you see Arnie in a dress?It's a one joke film.  Is it a good film?  No.  Do I like it?  Very much.  Call it a guilty favorite.One complaint--at 2 hours it's too long.

The premise is pretty funny, even if the idea of Ah-nold in a comedy makes one suspicious. I thought Twins was awful, and Conan a comedy by accident. Kindergarten Cop was better because Schwarzenegger was mostly a straight man. Here he is called on to act the part of a pregnant man opposite Danny DeVito and Emma Thompson. While it is not an Oscar calibre performance, he gets the job done.The story is reasonably simple. DeVito (a fertility specialist) and Schwarzenegger (a scientist) are partners working on a new miracle fertility drug. Their project gets canceled by the University and replaced by an ovarian study under the direction of Emma Thompson. They decide to implant an embryo in Schwarzenegger and continue the study illegally. They steal an egg from Thompson's ovarian study and the stage is set. Of course, the egg is Thompson's and she and Schwarzenegger are attracted to each other.Ivan Reitman does a very good job with the story, keeping it simple and staying focused on the characters. Had he spent a lot of time focusing on the physical comedy, the film would have failed. Instead we get to watch the ultimate macho figure take on the ultimate female experience. The contrast keeps the comedy rolling, while the characters carry the film.It is hardly a profound film, although it is intelligently written. The issues raised rely on simple male vs. female differences and the contrast of Schwarzenegger's image with this role is used to full effect. It's an enjoyable film with strong performances by Thompson and DeVito.

They are developing a new, experimental drug, Expectane, that will ensure pregnancies. So far they've been testing on chimps, but now they want to test it on humans. They meet with the FDA, who turns them down. Alex decided it was time to leave the university, so he packed up his things and left, just as his replacement, Dr. Diana Reddin, arrived. She was smart and beautiful, but very clumsy. Alex wanted to go back home to Europe, but Larry Arbogast wanted to continue experimentation with Expectane.He wanted to try it on, not a female specimen, but a male! He had Alex in mind. Alex declined, but Larry continued to plead with him, so finally he gave in. Larry borrowed a frozen egg from Dr. Reddin's cryogenics freezer, mixed in some Expectane and injected them into Alex. Then they perform a test and...Alex was pregnant! Alex stayed with Larry and continued to take Expectane daily. He even went back to work at the university. Right away Diana could tell something was up by the way Alex began throwing up and experiencing cramps. He even had a nightmare about what his baby would look like.One week later, Larry and Alex go out to dinner, and while Larry strikes a deal with Lyndon Pharmacuticals about marketing Expectane, Alex met Diana, and they dance. On the way home, Alex was seriously wondering what his baby would be like. This rush of hormones began to annoy Larry so he demanded that Alex stop taking Expectane and the embryo inside him would just absorb into his body. Alex didn't want to stop because he really wanted to see his baby, whom he called Junior. So he continued to take Expectane regularly. Ten weeks later, Alex's birthday, he was beginning to show. Larry found out and was not pleased, but he let Alex stay with him again. All the while, the head science professor, Noah Banes, grew suspicious because even though he had the Expectane project shut down, it was still being experimented with; One afternoon while Larry went to the lab, Alex stayed home. Diana suddenly dropped by because she wanted to see him, but acted like she was dropping off a file. Alex, with his rushing hormones tried moving in on Diana, until Larry's ex-wife, Angela, who was also pregnant stopped by. She wanted Larry to treat her, even though he was reluctant to do so. Alex begins living like any other pregnant man and scarfs down a monstrous dinner with Angela. Unfortunately, Larry was not the father of Angela's unborn baby, it was a member of Aerosmith. Boy was Larry Hurt; Noah Banes decided to pay Alex and Larry a visit one afternoon and while snooping around the house, he found their stockpile of Expectane so he thought they had used it to impregnate a woman. Boy was he wrong!Alex soon finds out that the egg he was injected with had actually been Diana's. She had named it Junior too! When Alex went to the university to tell Diana what has been happening, Banes got a good look at Alex, who was really showing now, and realized it hadn't been a woman they were experimenting on after all. Well, Alex told Diana that the baby inside him was actually THEIRS and, well, she didn't take it too well. That's when Banes burst in and threatened to exploit Alex and his pregnancy. He responded by tossing Banes into a rack of beakers and ran. Larry takes Alex somewhere to hide out for a while. They go to Casitas Madres, a health resort for pregnant women, then Larry leaves for Canada to negotiate with the Lyndon people. Alex tried fitting in among the other pregnant women ala Mrs. Doubtfire. But then, one fateful day, Alex, who has now been pregnant seven months, began to feel...Contractions! Larry called to check in and was told what was up so he dashed home. Diana, who had finally forgiven Alex, also raced over to help. Larry, Alex and Diana race to the hospital where Banes had set up a media circus. There was Paparazzi everywhere. Larry had a plan, so while Alex and Diana sneaked around back, Larry entered the hospital with Angela. With no pregnant man to see, Banes became a laughing stock. He also became unemployed; In the operating room, Dr. Snellin, Louise, and Larry all performed a C-section on Alex and...Before long, the blessed event took place and Alex was a father! Angela also gave birth that night and she proclaimed Larry the honorary father. Well, from then on, our new fathers and new mothers all lived happily ever after.What can I say about Junior? It was a good movie. Arnold Schwarzenegger was good. He is reunited with his co-star from Twins, Danny DeVito and his co-star from Kindergarten Cop, Pamela Reed. Also here is Emma Thompson. Everybody was good in their parts. Sure the movie may be absurd and bizarre at times, I mean when you hear about a pregnant man, you're bound to expect craziness. I wonder if something like that could ever be attempted in real life. But then men having babies would be a lot more trouble than with women. It's the natural order of things I guess, but anyway, if you like Arnold Schwarzenegger (the governor of my state) and Danny DeVito then I recommend Junior, and Twins. See them both! If you've ever wondered what it would be like to see Schwarzenegger pregnant, this is the movie to see it in!

The story line (man gets pregnant) is sufficiently well-known from the publicity that it need not be outlined here. I have always admired Arnie's refreshing unpretentiousness about his lack of acting ability, but he has indeed come far from the grunting days of Conan and in this movie attains some very good moments. He really does make you believe he's carrying to term.Good work all around - Emma Thompson (this great actress can't think too badly of Arnie to agree to make a movie with him; then again, is it the dough???) is a delightfully klutzy research scientist, and Danny DeVito plays a sympathetic role but with the inevitable undertones of sleazoid tackiness that he does so well. A good subplot is the relationship between DeVito and his divorced wife, also pregnant.The commenter who said the premise was 'medically conceivable' sic didn't know much about amniotic sacs, placentas, and umbilical cords. That's ok; suspend disbelief and enjoy the humor.The 'messages' here about gender roles and expectations are delivered with such a sense of humor that they are never preachy (I think of the classic Tootsie as a comparable example). An intelligently funny script, good comic pacing, and a hefty dose of outright slapstick make this a winner.

If you type Junior in to Google, the first hit is this movie, but if you type it in to the IMDb, the first hit is George W. Bush. I just thought that was funny.So by 1994, Schwarzenegger had just done a series of pretty hardcore action movies &#150; Terminator 2, Last Action Hero (shut up, that movie rocked), and True Lies &#150; so I'm really curious to know who came up with the idea of making a movie in which he gets pregnant and carries a baby to term. Yeah, Last Action Hero and especially Kindergarten Cop showed the world that Arnold was a big action movie star that was not above having a little fun with himself, but a pregnancy??Amazingly enough, however, the movie is much better than you might think. He stars as Dr. Alex Hesse, a scientist working on a new formula that will help create successful pregnancies for women having trouble conceiving. But the problem is that they are unable to get authorization to perform necessary tests so, desperate to prove that their formula works, Hesse and his partner Dr. Larry Arbogast decide to create a pregnancy in Hesse &#150; the world's first pregnant man!They do not, however have any intention of allowing the pregnancy to go on for more than a month or a month and a half, they just need to prove that their formula works. I am reminded of that scene in Terminator 2 when they are all at Miles Dyson's house and Sarah is telling Dyson that men like him through of the hydrogen bomb and they only know how to create destruction, they have no idea what it's like to feel a life growing inside you. In Junior, Hesse learns what it's like to have a life growing inside him, and tat life becomes more important to him than the science experiment that he and Arbogast were carrying out. There is a cleverly designed side story about Arbogast's ex-wife carrying a baby that resulted in a one-night stand after an Aerosmith concert, but the majority of the comedy in the movie is derived from Schwarzenegger literally not only turning into a woman, but poking fun at his real life self. When he goes to a pregnancy retreat dressed as a woman, he explains his manly performance by stating that back in her native Germany, she was a body-builder and excessive steroid use was considered perfectly common and acceptable. He experiences all of the ups and downs of being pregnant, but no matter how outlandish the premise is, there is no denying that the movie is definitely pretty charming. It was great to see Schwarzeneggger and Danny DeVito together again after their classic work together in Twins several years earlier. Once again, they have come together and brought us a great piece of family entertainment.

The film stars hulking Hollywood star Arnold Schwarzenegger and Danny DeVito where Arnie gets pregnant, it's the kind of plot made from hell, oh and also Ivan Reitman. It just doesn't work for me and comes off messy at best, it isn't the worst movie of all time and definitely not within comedy, but here are my thoughts below.The plot is just confused and I mean in a way where the story just rides along not really knowing where it is going, can be fun and will be for some, but still not memorable. It isn't funny and for me that is it's greatest sin, the jokes don't come and the direction from Reitman doesn't add anything whatsoever to the writing that strips this of all respect.Schwarzenegger deserves a bit of respect for giving it a go, not in a kind of good way but he tries his hardest and he acts in the only way he knows how. Emma Thompson comes in as the new Doctor on the scene Diana, she is OK here but she doesn't do anything to help, this is the kind of movie that can truly ruin careers, thank god this didn't contain the very very best(at least at the time). I think to really enjoy this you have to not only laugh at a lot, but also be won over by the sweetness of the plot, not by the depth, this is one movie truly lacking in true depth. If you want a serious plot, well this tries to be one but turns out one massive joke, that also isn't funny. Kevin Wade and Chris Conrad don't write this well enough to entertain most, those easily won over then yes, but this just doesn't work right.As the great Roger Ebert once said about Junior I know this sounds odd, but Schwarzenegger is perfect for the role. Observe his acting carefully in Junior, and you'll see skills that many serious actors could only envy. Now I don't agree with this quote but I see where he is coming from, Arnie seems to as I mentioned before, match the role and he makes the character seem more real(to say he is a huge pregnant man). Danny DeVito doesn't supply him with enough for me though, now DeVito for some is great but I have never loved him, and here he further proves me right.I think finding positives here is as hard as it can get, this isn't the worst film ever but it is hard to find lots and lots of positives. I liked the sets if that is even a real reason, well OK it isn't but It really is hard, The plot I guess is fun(at times) and can as I have also said before, be sweet and Arnie gives his all in making his character more human. Overall a pretty bad movie but one that even today is still remembered fairly well. Reitman directs DeVito and Schwarzenegger again after they came together in Twins(1988), but he doesn't succeed in making these two classic although I will say he does make this classic as that movie where Arnold Schwarzenegger gets pregnant, and I'll use my consensus one more time, good for some, not fun for most.

There are some jokes here, many of them obvious, but for a lot of the running time the film adopts a mawkish and sentimental tone which doesn't make for a very enjoyable viewing experience. There are also HUGE plot holes surrounding the male pregnancy, such as the film not explaining how the baby grows in Schwarzenegger's stomach without an umbilical cord.The worst thing about the story is the script, which is threadbare in the extreme. Characters like the shoe-horned in villain played by Frank Langella are lame and just a way to clutter up the running time. The acting is pretty bad, particularly in the case of the excruciating Emma Thompson, whose attempts at 'slapstick' humour fall flat time and time again. I could hardly bear to watch her in this. Schwarzenegger himself is wooden, playing an unlikeable character, and the only decent performance comes from Danny DeVito.

This can be based on the kind of viewing experience it gives its audience. As for this movie, it is difficult to classify where this male version of a chick flick should be placed. It is quite honestly one of the most oddest oddballs anyone could watch. This is mostly due to the case because the concept overall was new (for its time) and sounded good on paper. Nonetheless, that doesn't mean it would look good in real life. So in order to make this happen without it having coming across as a freak show, director Ivan Reitman turned it into a comedy. Yet somehow, this did not make it any less bewildering of a production. The entire running time is just weird.Dr. Larry Arbogast (Danny DeVito) convinces his cohort Dr. Alex Hesse (Arnold Schwarzenegger) to test himself as a human lab rat for a pregnancy test after the two are fired from the University they work for by Noah Banes (Frank Langella). Replacing the two doctors is the young and beautiful Dr. Diana Reddin (Emma Thompson) who soon joins the confusion and nonsense that erupts. For its writing, credit must be given for being ambitious. It also brings up a couple of good points about what it's like to be a mom and the side effects of being pregnant. These kinds of notions are demonstrated through Arnold who goes through all these definitive moments (that's next to be contended to). Along with that is Emma Thompson's character who at least sheds some light on the struggles that women go through that men would certainly not understand (even in Arnold's case). Setting this to the side, the rest of the story is just DeVito and Schwarzenegger telling lies in order to hold over the experiment. A very silly pot-boiler plot and it shows because the two writers behind this, Kevin Wade and Chris Conrad did not really have enough experience to produce a screenplay with decent quality.As a comedy, it's not strong. DeVito, the funnyman, only has a few quips that are noteworthy. The best is when he's discovered of lying. Arnold only had one funny moment and that's when he yells like a man instead of acting like a woman and its only funny because of the doofy face he has at the time. In fact, this film actually makes the female actors like Emma Thompson and Pamela Reed (Dr. Arbogast's ex) funnier than the male actors. This is because they are actual females and don't need to act like a woman. I don't know, it's just outlandish seeing action man Arnold Schwarzenegger acting like a woman in drag. It doesn't feel right and it's more of a put-off than anything else. But who knew, in 2007 Thomas Beattie the first man (who was originally a woman) would actually become pregnant. And that was no comedy. Even Christopher Meloni from Law & Order SVU has a more natural role in this story. But I digress.The rest of the components to the film aren't that great either. Cinematography provided by Adam Greenberg who shot for other megahit movies like The Terminator (1984) and Terminator 2 Judgement Day (1991) goes all out wishy-washy this time. There's nothing really interesting to look at here other than the occasional bright and feminine colors that appear in the usual maternity rooms. The practical effects are OK but are immediately ruined when the special effects kick in and it is very noticeable. As clear as day, and looking back on it, it looks underdeveloped. As for music, arranged by James Newton Howard, the tracks do work with the softer more emotional moments but for the comedic moments it doesn't. Howard's music is somewhat of the reversal of the contemporary styles of Christopher Lennertz's music, where he can maintain the comedic notes but not much of any emotional ones.This feature is an irregular mix of comedy, drama and romance it only works in a few places. The female actresses are funnier than the male actors are and watching Arnold Schwarzenegger become a mom is not the most enlightening experience or the most realistic one.

However, Schwarzenegger starts to develop motherly feelings for his baby...In a somewhat parallel plot, Mr. DeVito's ex-wife Pamela Reed (as Angela) has just been impregnated by an Aerosmith band member or associate...Junior cleverly skirts scientific implausibility. It throws out medical terms here and there, without really explaining anything. Although a test tube would be preferable, they plot to plant a fertilized human egg into a man's body. Unexplained is how this experiment will help a female pregnancy &#x96; but, perhaps a rising tide lifts all boats. The drug may even be able to prevent the fetus from killing its male host body. Even without a womb, Schwarzenegger is a tough guy. By being vague, this script works. The situation comedy is carried mostly by Schwarzenegger's predicament, with producer-director Ivan Reitman and his crew delivering the goods. However, the story always only goes for the most obvious humor; when it approaches any sort of depth, Junior stops short. It's skillfully produced, but steadfastly refuses to take any real chances with the material. In featured roles, Frank Langella and Judy Collins are employed well.****** Junior (11/23/94) Ivan Reitman ~ Arnold Schwarzenegger, Danny DeVito, Emma Thompson, Pamela Reed "},{"Title":"Utter nonsense but not that bad","Date":"2 August 2013","Score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Romance, Sci-Fi","Review":" Built on a bedrock of hard science and a sound what if? premise, Ivan Reitman's thoughtful film is...

A surprisingly decent (honest) Arnold Schwarzenegger is a scientist (stay with me here) who, along with partner Danny DeVito (it's only a film) has developed a drug to prevent miscarriages. With you so far, movie. But their funding is cut and Arnie has no choice but to test the drug on himself - by getting pregnant. So that's the premise, then.

Arnold Schwartzenegger is a scientist who wants to test a pregnancy drug for women but doesn't get permission to do it. Instead, he and Danny DeVito come up with the utterly deranged idea to decide to test it on a man, that being Schwartzenegger obviously. After starting the experiment somehow, Arnold eventually abandons the testing in exchange for keeping the baby, acting like a sensitive woman, etcetera, etcetera, etcetera.This film is terrible. It's your basic 1990s big-tough-guy-tapping-into-his-feminine-side awful comedy like 'Mr Nanny' I suppose (lessons which have NOT been beneficial to men OR women, but that's another story). There is some cheesy feminist rhetoric as to 'my body my choice' and 'you should try being a woman, it's a nightmare' (which in and of itself makes no logical sense), and none of it is remotely funny. I suppose the problem is that now that male sensitivity is mainstream to a somewhat crippling level, this film fails to be funny anymore. It just looks dated. The science which propels this horrifying idea forward is broken - how the hell does Arnold even grow a baby, having no womb?

What Hesse doesn't know is that Abrogast stole the egg that was ejected from and stored away by a new doctor named Diana Reddin. But when Hesse goes into labor, an evil Professor is going to try to make the biggest news story ever about a pregnant man so he can get rich! My first impression on Junior really sappy! Arnold makes one of his worst performances as Dr. Hesse who first seems like a baby hater but turns out to be a drug maker for baby eggs. The danger prone Dr. Reddin is a lame love interest and the slime ball villain Dr. Banes is a total pussycat. The only real good performance is brought to us by Danny DeVito as Larry Arbogast, he gave a good social comical performance as a baby doctor who cares for his work and does anything on his own terms. Now the story is crazy and the sequences just keep skipping possible moments that can make the movie interesting! It goes from Hesse finding out the egg is planted and he is pregnant to two weeks later, then ten week, then three months! And the jokes are not funny! Arnold dressing up as a woman to be safe from Dr. Banes is not funny, Larry's ex-wife getting pregnant from a person part of Aerosmith is not funny, the danger prone Dr. Reddin is not funny. This film is so sappy and it's loaded with pregnancy jokes that involves Arnold being a glut eating, saying he got cramps, getting a big stomach, buying larger clothes, being radiant and happy...Arnold you fool! Junior gets the 4, a sappy film that is just to low to enjoy. Good for people who like to listen about pregnancy or if you just want to catch a few winks of sleep.

He had made a little film with Danny DeVito named `Twins,' and a sweet-natured comedy called `Kindergarten Cop.' And let's not forget his very first film, `Hercules in New York,' a.k.a. `Hercules Goes Bananas,' which would have fit the title much better.But `Junior' is, by far, the worst comedy Schwarzenegger has starred in. Well, it's a close tie between `Jingle All the Way.'Schwarzenegger plays a doctor who takes some top-secret medication, which makes him pregnant. Arnie pregnant. I wouldn't want to be there when the contractions kick in. DeVito plays the doctor who helps keep it under wraps. Basically, the whole comedy blunders around doing nothing slowly. It had a lot of potential even with its ridiculous plot, but they just couldn't pull it off. They spend too much time doing nothing, including a scene with DeVito and Schwarzenegger talking about how DeVito's girlfriend ran off and had a child with an Aerosmith band member. So we really need specifics? But that doesn't keep the mandatory one-liners from coming. I was waiting for Arnie to be in the throes of labor. I can see him being pulled back on top of a medical cot. And then he turns to Danny DeVito and says, `I'll be back!' Too bad they didn't use that one. It would have been good.The funniest line in the film? `This is my body! I'll do whatever I want!' Classic Arnie.Basically, when it all comes down to it, there is nothing particularly special about `Junior.' Sadly, we've seen it all before.

I was right. The only reason I watched it was because I was stuck in a hotel in Korea, and couldn't sleep.Aside from beating a single lame joke to death, Junior threw in way too many gratuitous bones to the proabortion lobby. (I guess the idea being that Hollywood just has to underscore their theory that if men could get pregnant, abortion would be a sacrament.) Arnie and DeVito intended to abort the fetus after a brief test pregnancy -- repeating again and again that the whole experiment will be completed by the end of the first trimester. Yup -- killing fetuses less than one trimester old is so morally neutral that it's okay to create the embryo with the express intention of killing it off quick, before it becomes human!At the end of the first trimester, Arnie is supposed to stop taking the drug cocktail that sustains the pregnancy. He looks at the vial of blue fluid at the time he's supposed to deliberately miss his first dose, then talks to the fetus, telling it he doesn't know if it's a boy or a girl so he'll call it Junior. And he downs the drug, hence converting the pregnancy into my baby. The whole thing is absurd, since DeVito plays an obstetrician and he'd been doing routine ultrasounds so they'd have known already if the baby was male or female.Later, when the big bad guy from the oppressive patriarchal university learns that Arnie is pregnant, he gets guards and tries to take Arnie into custody. Arnie tosses the guards, telling the big bad guy, My body, my choice! One of the women in the lab yells, Amen! Since the bad guy wasn't even trying to abort Arnie's baby, this was clearly a gratuitious attempt to get across the bizarre idea that the only reason Arnie was able to get pregnant and have his baby was because abortion was legal. As if that had squat to do with it.If you're a rabid abortion supporter, you'll probably love Junior for all the propaganda moments. I can't see anybody else much caring for it. "},{"Title":"Mother Arnie ...","Date":"14 July 2015","Score":"","Genre":"Comedy, Romance, Sci-Fi","Review":" By reuniting the incongruous Arnold Schwarzenegger and Danny de Vito duo again, the exploit of Ivan Reitman's Junior is to make an even more touching and funny comedy than his previous Twins, once again, based on the same premise of an improbable scientific situation.Improbable is quite an understatement. It's crazy enough to have a man facing pregnancy but out of all the actors who could pull it with more or less believability, hiring the ultimate tough guy, the one with the most masculine height and bone structure was quite a risky move. Risky but not absurd, there are times when you're entitled to a certain level of absurdity when making a comedy movie, but you can tell that Junior ambition reached higher than simple laughs, it wanted to tell a heart-warming story, a comedy with a heart, as I like to say.This is why the casting was a masterstroke. This isn't Twins where Schwarzenegger's perfection was the illustration of a successful genetic manipulation and De Vito, all the opposite, here, Arnie's casting isn't crucial to the part, neither is Danny De Vito, but at the end, you realize that the movie couldn't have worked with better actors. De Vito has this 'streetwise businessman with sharp teeth' thing justifying such a gutsy idea, and Arnie is the cold European scientist so dedicated to his profession that we believe he can be lured into that crazy project.Yet the film could have sinned by cynicism, showing that there's a mad scientist or sorcerer apprentice hiding behind every doctor, and that laboratories would trade ethics for the financial success of a revolutionary medicine, in the film's case, one to increase women's fertility and estrogen production. But they're not allowed to test the medicine on women. Never mind, the bounds of science are unlimited. And after all, didn't Jenner inoculated himself the smallpox virus to check if the vaccination worked, there comes a time where every scientist must question his vocation and push it to the extreme, for science's sake.This left me a little perplexed but by an extraordinary coincidence, the same day I saw junior, I found a documentary about the history of medicine and viruses, and not only I found out that Jenner actually tested the smallpox vaccination on a little boy, which was even more debatable and could've earned him a radiation had it failed? But that it took almost two decades for penicillin to really get its worldwide attention because Fleming was a good researcher but not much of a marketer and couldn't even get the implications his discovery would make.So, in a way, there's a little mad scientist here, a businessmen there, but it's always for people's own good, and this is where Junior really takes you, it's not a movie about lobbying or genetic manipulation. It's the story of a man who discovers his maternal side by the simple process of feeling a baby inside him, and Arnold Schwarzenegger makes it not only believable but also touching, he doesn't overplay, within his own (not so limited) range, he finds the perfect note to draw a touched smile in your face, and there's one wonderful moment where he De Vito's character touch the belly and smiles, so moving you forget the implausibility of the situation.But there can't be a film about pregnancy without women, and both Pamela Reed and Emma Thompson plays respectively De Vito's ex-wife and the scientist who took Arnie's laboratory. Thompson is such a gifted actress that she knows how to make you laugh from rather predictable situations, and her involuntary involvement in the pregnancy gives a film a nice little twist. To close the gallery, there's also Frank Langella who plays the obligatory antagonist to the story but the essential is in the pregnancy.Indeed, they are the reason to be of the film, and everything is handled in such a way that you never feel it over the top. Take when Arnie is disguised as a woman, anyone would laugh at the immediate sight and while it's it's not Dustin Hoffman in Tootsie, Arnie gives a wonderful explanation about the reason his looks don't necessarily match his gender, and we buy it because within the film own zaniness, there's something touching and involving and leading us to a wonderful climax.Now, does the film reflects some gender views that in each man, there's a woman inside, I think it's much more conservative than that. Indeed, by becoming more feminine through pregnancy, there's something that might imply that the main identifying aspect of women is the capability to give life, to carry life, and maybe this is why women are generally, the most protective, the least destructive and the most caring of both sexes. But if this sounds misogynistic to say it, well, that's how sad today's world has become.

Of course their were two successes Dustin Hoffman in Tootsie which is my favorite movie of all time, and then a decade later there was Robin Williams in Mrs. Doubtfire which was not a masterpiece like Tootsie but still was an entertaining and fun film. Of course since Tootsie and Mrs. Doubtfire did wonders for Dustin Hoffman and Robin Williams turning into women they had to do it with Schwarzenegger and I can tell you it did not do much for him like the other two actors. This is not a bad movie but the whole plot is one joke. Danny De Vito manipulates Schwarzenegger into putting sperm into his body for an experiment because no scientist will believe De Vito's experiment and De Vito wants to abort Arnold's baby but he wants to keep it. And Schwarzenegger becomes feminine, gets fat, and becomes a mommy. Then Schwarzenegger has a relationship with De Vito's rival at his lab (Emma Thomson) and she gets pregnant and Arnold becomes both mommy and daddy. And the finale of Junior (I felt I have already given enough away so I won't mention the finale) is very predictable and not very funny. This is an average film. It really could have done wonders for Schwarzenegger and De Vito's career if the writing was more unpredictable, more fresh, and more witty. Instead we get a recycling of Tootsie and Mrs. Doubtfire that is mediocre. I can also see why Schwarzenegger did not do much comedies after this one. He had his moment with Twins and Kindergarten Cop but he was not very funny anymore after Junior. Another annoyance was De Vito's ex-wife (Pamela Reed) and how De Vito was supposed to be her baby's father but she was dating another man. I got really tired of that after a while. Gender-bending comedies were funny up until Mrs. Doubtfire but Junior was one perfect example of that humor draining away.

And who better to try this on than muscle-bound man's man Arnie.Schwarzenegger's come a long way from his Conan days and is most enjoyable as the emotional and radiantly glowing 'mom', Dr. Alex Hesse.

And as the hapless, clumsy cryogenicist Dr. Diana Reddin, Emma Thompson shows a talent for humour. Frank Langella and Pamela Reed, two other Reitman faves, also add to the fun.The narrative does attempt to deliver some serious messages about relationships and shared experiences, but Kevin Wade and Chris Conrad's script works best in comic mode, though it's never outrageously funny.

DeVito is Larry, a doctor and Ahnold is Alex, a scientist - the two are working on a pregnancy drug for women. When the FDA refuses to accept it, Alex loses his lab to Diana (Thompson) who feels terrible about it and offers to let him share the lab with her. Stuck as to how to get the drug pushed forward and gain the attention of a pharmaceutical company who will invest in it, Larry comes up with the idea of impregnating Alex in order to get data, but only for the first trimester. Alex, however, bonds with the fetus and wants to continue to term.Obviously the plot makes for some very funny moments. My favorite is Alex dressing like a huge woman and going to stay in a sanitarium for pregnant women, explaining his appearance by saying that while doing sports in Germany, he took steroids. The cast is great, and the direction is fast-paced.Junior is a funny gender bender about a man feeling a woman's emotions. It's very character-driven, and the actors play it straight, making it all the funnier. Seeing Arnold pregnant is a sight to behold and not one easily forgotten. Highly recommended.

"},{"Title":"Slight perhaps, but Junior has its amusements","Date":"19 November 2007","Score":"","Genre":"Comedy, Romance, Sci-Fi","Review":" Ever since Ivan Reitman directed Arnold Schwarzenegger and Danny DeVito in Twins, I always hoped there would be a sequel. Unfortunately, one never emerged. But that didn't stop the three of them reuniting for another project, Junior, the rather tall tale of the world's first pregnant man.To say Junior was disliked at the time of its release is an understatement. The film was savaged, mauled, drawn and quartered. And it was a colossal flop. Most people attribute Junior and Last Action Hero to the beginning of the end of Arnie's career.So the question is...is Junior as bad as its made out to be? My answer is...not quite.Most people hated it because they couldn't get they're heads around the idea of action man tough guy Arnie as a pregnant man. To bring us back to Twins, it strikes me as unusual that people would buy into the rather ludicrous idea of Arnold Schwarzenegger and Danny DeVito as twin brothers. But they did. So it seems a little hypocritical that people refused to do the same for Junior.I will admit its not without a few flaws. It doesn't always flow as smoothly as Twins. Junior sometimes strains to squeeze enough jokes out of its slight concept. And of course the simple fact that this could never happen kept nagging in the back of my mind. But Junior has its pleasures. You just have to look hard enough.Arnold Schwarzenegger is surprisingly a good choice for the role. I get the impression there are not many male actors in the world who could have pulled this off as successfully. Because the temptation to overact would have been too great. Ivan Reitman was wise to cast Arnie, because he knows of Arnie's love of deflating his own image. And that Schwarzenegger's often wooden style of acting could work to his advantage here.Arnie and DeVito play scientists Dr Alexander Hesse and Dr Larry Arbogast. Alex is a man with no social skills. He has neither the use for them, nor the time. Larry is an ambitious scientist hoping to patent a new fertility drug. Alex tolerates Larry, but they're working relationship is cut short when the University terminates Alex's research funds.Just as Alex is on his way back to Europe, Larry convinces him that his wonder drug could make millions if they document its effects on a live test subject. And Alex is the unwilling guinea pig. A couple of sperm samples and a few oestrogen injections later, Alex is actually pregnant! But how long can they keep it under wraps before the University gets suspicious?Junior basically goes through the motions of a standard pregnancy. Morning sickness. Cravings. Joint pains. Low self-esteem. But the novelty to it all is that its happening to a man. And it has to be said, Arnie does wonders with the role.Arnie shows a very astute intuition of the role. His decision not to go too over the top proves to be the film's saving grace. He's aware of all the changes taking place inside his body, but he greets them all with an admirably straight face. And when his hormones force him to get more emotional, he downplays them without getting too dour. Arnold Schwarzenegger is sometimes a better actor than we give him credit for. And Junior holds a very subtle, carefully judged performance on his part.There is of course a lot of amusement to be had from the idea of a pregnant man, but somehow, when the man in question is Arnie, that idea becomes positively sidesplitting. The more pregnant Arnie gets, the funnier the film becomes. And watching his straight face melt into maternal warmth is not only joyous but rather touching too.Where in Twins, the heart of the film was the odd-couple pairing of Schwarzenegger and DeVito, that doesn't seem quite as important this time. The two actors have a fine rapport, and we get a few of the expected amusements, like when they're mistaken for a gay couple, but Reitman is far more interested in Arnie's delicate condition than expanding upon the characters he's surrounded him with.DeVito just falls into his usual likable huckster persona that he's honed to perfection. But there's not much more to Larry beyond that. We do get a very funny supporting turn from Emma Thompson as a klutzy, scatterbrained scientist who accidentally 'contributes' to Larry's experiment. Thompson's talents as a comedienne have always been undervalued. The different facial expressions she pulls at Arnie's condition are priceless. But again she is underdeveloped too.I do feel Junior sometimes goes too far in its search for laughs. Alex disguised as a woman at a pregnant mothers retreat probably sounded funnier on paper. But Alex's explanation for his appearance is priceless.Nevertheless, it all ends quite satisfyingly. The actual birth is surprisingly touching considering the circumstances. Especially when the concept is so difficult to swallow. Junior has faults it never completely surmounts, but its got laughs aplenty, thanks in no small part to the surprisingly radiant Arnie!

The premise is absolutely ridiculous. Fine, you might say, but the film is just not funny, at any stage. Arnie is a screen legend, his action films generally hitting the spot and providing plenty of laughs. This so-called comedy falls terribly flat. The story sees Arnie become pregnant in the name of science. Cue some gender swapping traits etc and the sight of Arnie in a dress. But as I said, it just isn't funny. There are some nauseating scenes in this, with endless morals and moaning. Arnie by 1994 was worth trillions. He didn't need the cash, so I can only assume that his greed was at its peak when he signed the contract to star in this sorry mess. Junior should be deleted from memory.

I don't think there is another actor in Hollywood who could carry off the role of a pregnant man with more panache than Arnold Schwartzenegger. I give him so much credit for taking this role, but he has always taken roles in which he makes fun of his own macho image -- that's what I like best about him. In fact, movies like this one and Twins and Jingle All the Way and Kindergarden Cop (It's nod a tumah!) demonstrate that Arnold has been wasted on silly action films -- his true genius is for silly comedy! And who would have thought that classically-trained Emma Thompson, serious heroine of Jane Austen stories, could be such a fantastic slap-stick klutz comedienne! When her shoe flies across the room with the toilet paper stuck to it, I couldn't stop laughing. She definitely does not stand on her dignity in this movie! I really give her credit too for taking this role. And Danny DeVito is, of course, always great.

Isn't it funny how, in Hollywood, all geeks of the fairer sex are either perfectly beautiful, or, you know, television ugly, meaning, basically a pretty girl, just with unflattering clothes, glasses and/or bad hair? It's not a poorly done flick. It's shot, edited and scored just fine. Pacing is reasonable. The plot develops nicely, though it is entirely predictable.
