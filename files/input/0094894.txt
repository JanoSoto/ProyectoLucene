[{"Title":"Classic","Date":"24 April 2006","Score":"42 out of 49 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Crime, Drama","Review":" Consider the range and the capture of characters in one movie, Colors delivers multiple plot lines from a number of sides. I remember when this movie first came out I was in Jr. high school. Colors was a controversial movie talked about by teachers, principles and parents because, believe it or not, it had a tendency for glorification and encouraging gang membership. To my surprise, the movie has little glorification in it and was a grim summary of Los Angeles gang life (and even that of law enforcement.) The movie does not spoon feed its audience, save for a few minor comments that were cheesy at their worst and cleverly woven in at their best. In some cases the portrayal of gang life in LA might have been TOO broad and sophisticated for many viewers. The title COLORS and its implication was meant to explain the rival Crip and Blood gangs but in fact that was merely a pretext. Soon into the movie the viewer is taken into various other neighborhoods as well as other gangs, including WHITE FENCE and 21st Street. For those that denounce this movie as being outdated, cheesy or otherwise, it's hard for me to understand what you are paying attention to. If you remember the 80's in the slightest, it was a time of decadent and flamboyant neon glow ala Prince, Michael Jackson and various other nonsense. The irony is that COLORS portrays a world that was virtually isolated and separate from the 80's because that is what it was MEANT to point out. This was gang life at its peak, before any of the gangster rap hit white suburbia and became a marketable fad. This was BEFORE white folks thought it was cool. It was isolated from the look and feel of the rest of the 80's because this world was isolated from the general population.For this reason I am surprised that anyone would call the movie outdated in any way. Timeless is the word I use to describe it.Despite all this, Hopper manages to incorporate the storyline between Duval and Penn. Not only is this a brilliant interaction between two great actors, it also has a more marketable value to a white audience that would otherwise have been turned off by the subject matter and considered it, unfairly, as a blacksploitation film. Let's face it, Hollywood is big business. The ability to market this movie with ANY semblance of a good plot line but making it even remotely realistic is an amazing achievement. Hopper goes beyond doing both. I would not be surprised to see this movie in the classics section, someday.

Back then, urban gang warfare was comfortably distant. This is before cell phones, bling, rims, before the thug life became a marketable commodity.Colors is distinctive for Hopper's tight focus, his honest approach and complete lack of sentimentality. The world depicted here is horizontal, and filmed horizontally; it is ugly and unironic, and in a way egalitarian; there are NO courts or lawyers, every introduction of ethics is literally shot down. It's hard to imagine anything being made like this in today's multiculti/PC world, any such attempt would immediately provoke shrieking and clutching of skirts at the sight of 'racism'. This paradigm of movie-making didn't survive, it disappeared like Duvall's soul in that departing helicopter shot. Unfortunately, the trend went the way of Boyz n the Hood.

This movie is the original article in urban-street dramas that spawned many followers in the 90's. But like those films it is an intense, powerful movie that takes you to the streets in an extremely realistic way. The caption on the VHS cover says something like two gangs at war(Bloods & Crips)with the police caught in between. Well, that is pretty misleading. Although most films like this would stick with the gang war as the main focus, COLORS has many different plot levels that all come together very nicely. Sean Penn & Robert Duvall are right on the mark as the two officers on the beat. The film ultimately succeeds through its perspectives, giving points of view from all sides and fully expresses the harsh reality that everyone involved faces. When the film first came out, it was bashed for its extreme violence and portrayal of gang members. Well, I definitely think Dennis Hopper did an excellent job and I feel that violence is crucial in a film like this to add to its strong sense of reality which some people may not be too familiar with.

It's a pretty realistic view (again, I'm not a gang banger, so maybe my view is skewed) of the gang life in L.A. And it was the first to really portray it... I'm still a big fan of Boyz in the Hood (not for excitement, but for a good story about a tough life). But this was the first (as I recall) and Hopper deserves a great deal of credit for that.

Colors is a mature work from a filmmaker who knows what he's doing, and will let the actors and the mood of the streets and the temperament of the current events (which were practically untenable in the late 80s and early 90s in gang-banger) LA.Matter of fact, this should have been Hopper's professional calling-card, showing that he can make a film that isn't an art-film or too experimental (Last Movie) or under the radar (Out of the Blue). Indeed you'd have to remind most people that Hopper even directed it since, frankly, he lets his stars steal the show, and rightfully so. There's not a solid plot to speak of, more-so a character study of two cops, one older one younger, who are partnered up and have to tackle the ghettos and slums, loaded with Blue (Crips) and Red) (Bloods), and also the various Hispanic gangs that are not as notorious but still as powerful and dangerous.It's a series of pieces that soon take shape into a story, but it's not even about that. It's just about following these gangs and being true to their nature of their rites of passage (beating up the new kids and setting them off to prove themselves), their bond and codes, their can-do attitude even when they're behind bars or in hand-cuffs, and the collective wisdom that you can either talk to a cop or just run... or, another alternative, shoot. It's also about a value system and class differences; the former relating, of course, to Hodges (Duvall) and Penn, who don't see eye to eye on how to apprehend suspects or treat them. Penn's younger guy isn't a crooked cop or corrupted, but he's a hot-head, a junkie for adrenaline, while Duvall's been around the block way too many times (and even admits that he had a higher post before and is still on the streets for reasons not totally made clear) to put up with being like a gangster as he says.And the class part relates to the difference between McGavin (Penn) and his supposed girlfriend, who comes from the Latino parts of the hood and has family that Hodges has come in contact with as a cop, putting them up against the wall. It's through this that we see the split between the people in Lost Angeles, and while it's not a subtle point really (and may even be one of the more clich√© things in the picture), it still goes a way to try and add immediacy to the drama, and McGain's own personal conflicts on the streets. And, again, those gangs, some played by actors (Don Cheadle and Damon Wayans in early roles, Sy Richardson), others by I would assume real gang-bangers and people 'from the streets' (another thing Hopper is good at, casting real people, which he doesn't get enough credit for), that are allowed to be fleshed out and made into real people, or as real as they can be in this movie.The filmmakers don't make us feel sympathy for the gang members, but through making them human beings as opposed to just targets and caricatures, it adds to the whole experience of being about something. Nothing here is exploited; it's a well-researched time-capsule that still holds its own years later, least as long as there are crips and bloods and other gangs and, you know, hot-headed cops with old-timer veterans. Very solid, professional film-making.

This film, along with the rise of gangster rap were probably my first exposure to this culture. And its safe to say that if anything, the problem has only gotten worse in the past two decades. Gangs are still killing each other, and they seldom need a reason to do so.Colors is a fairly daring film directed by Dennis Hopper. The story wishes to point out the plight of inner-city youths caught up in gangs as well as the futility of law enforcement in dealing with them. Robert Duvall and Sean Penn play basically the timeless good cop/bad cop duo out to learn what they can on the street and help prevent as much gang crime as possible. The film starts out strongly detailing the differences in their respective approaches to the job. Both men are a joy to watch, and continue to be so to this day. There are few American actors as talented as either man. However, as the story progresses, these two main characters seem to get kind of lost in the shuffle, and the story becomes more about the gang members. They are mostly interesting people, but you're going to find yourself wishing for more of the two leads.The film is packed with shootouts and car chases.... perhaps a few too many. A lot of thought went into stunt work, fight scenes, and explosions. Most are not needed. Had Colors stayed more of a thoughtful drama instead of an action pic, it would have had a much bigger impact. The Los Angeles we see here is well filmed, and seems off limits to those who don't live there. This was certainly the intention. There are some wonderful little details that project the local flare. In one scene for example, while Penn and Duvall are questioning a group of Hispanic suspects in the Barrio, you can hear a rooster crowing just off screen. The cast is teeming with soon-to-be famous folks like Damon Wayans, Don Cheadle, Glen Plummer and many others. Look out for a young Mario Lopez as a young gang member. But what on earth was Malakai from Children of the Corn doing in the Barrio???? 7 of 10 stars.The Hound.

The streets of Los Angeles are currently overrun by two of the most violent gangs around The Crips who dress in blue and the Bloods who dress in red. And these gangs are always at war with each other. The LAPD has created a group of 24 cops called C.R.A.S.H Community Resistance Against Street Hoodlums. One cop in this group was rough, gruff Officer Ben Hodges. This morning Hodges is assigned a new partner rookie cop Daniel McGavin with a violent attitude. They go out to investigate a drive-by shooting that occurred the previous night. The Crips, lead by Rocket, and consisted of T-Bone and Dog-Man, shot Blood member Robert Craig. Hodges and McGavin are able to stop a few gang members who are suspected of drug posession. McGavin just wants to bust them but Hodges just lets them off with a warning. Just then, they witness suspects driving away at high speeds so they jump in their car and give chase. The suspects, Crips, had gunned down the house where Robert Craig's funeral services were taking place. They race through traffic and finally the suspect's car comes to a crashing halt. Literally. Unfortunately, thanks to McGavin's driving, their car turns upside down. At that point, Hodges invites McGavin over for dinner and says he can bring a date. McGavin brings over Louisa, whom he met at a burger joint. Louisa was crazy about Hodges' kids and would love some of her own the next day.        McGavin and Louisa get real close. They even do the horizontal mambo the next night; A young man was seen spray painting over some names on a graffiti mural. Hodges tried to talk to him when McGavin decided the right approach was to spray paint the kid's face. Hodges wasn't pleased about that and after that, Louisa got mad at McGavin because that kid was her cousin. Apparently she was in on the gangs. Hodges and McGavin got a new car that was bright yellow, so McGavin's new street name was PacMan. C.R.A.S.H then proceeds to jail the Crips and Bloods. Local Crip, High Top, is jailed and beaten up by the Bloods. Dr. Feelgood, another vile gangster, is arrested too. Then the cops get some leads on Rocket by going to one of his girlfriends', Sharon Robbins, and catches her fornicating with Killer Bee. Officer Baines guns down Killer Bee because he thought he was reaching for a gun, but he was actually reaching for his pants. The Crips blame McGavin for what happened and put a hit out for him. As for Officer Baines, he was tried and his case did not look good.         The Bloods throw a big party that night, but just then Rocket and his Crip friends drive-by and gun the place down. That did it. The Bloods regroup and decide to get the Crips once and for all. They first drive by a house where the Crips hang out. The Bloods loaded their guns and began firing. Some Crips came outside and all were gunned down. Finally Rocket came out and he too was gunned down dead. The Bloods celebrate after that, but then the cops show up. Just as they were cuffing the gang members, one of them grabbed a gun and gunned down Hodges! Well, after that, McGavin got a new partner and was still on the beat. He would not rest until the Crips and the Bloods were both brought to justice. It's obsurd to think of people getting killed over something as frivilous as...Colors.         This film was pretty good. A gripping drama. It's a little like Lethal Weapon. Sean Penn and Mel Gibson are alot alike, so are Robert Duvall and Danny Glover. Sean Penn and Robert Duvall were very good in their parts. These aren't your typical lazy, coffee slurping, doughnut scarfing cops, these are rough, tough cops who don't take nothing from nobody. If you like Robert Duvall, I also recommend Falling Down. That features gangs and Robert plays an LAPD detective. Michael Douglas is in it. Also in the Colors cast were Maria Conchita Alonso as Louisa, Don Cheadle as Rocket, Damon Wayans as T-Bone, Glenn Plummer as High Top, and Grand Bush as Larry Sylvester. So if you like gripping action/dramas about police vs. the war on crime, then Colors is for you.

Like 1969's 'Easy Rider', this film was notable for its real life write the plot elements by screenwriters Michael Schiffer & Richard Di Lello. However, do to that standard of writing. It's somewhat slow in paced. There are tons of pointless boring filler, in this film. The violence action in this film is also very random, just as much as it's nudity. It really comes out of nowhere, and has little bearing to the main plot. While, most of the action scenes, are somewhat realistic in tone, however, there was at least, one scene at the beach front that really went over the top. It felt like, I was watching a different movie with its 'Lethal Weapon' style bike chase. Because of that, I couldn't say, this movie was a great film. It was too uneven. Still, the film was fine for the most part. Made in the era, before the 1992 South Central riots & many years before 2000 Rampart scandal destroy the CRASH (Community Resources Against Street Hoodlums) special operations unit of the Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD). The film tells the story of two CRASH cops, experienced season veteran, Officer Bob Hodges (Robert Duvall) and rookie partner, and hot-head, Officer Danny McGavin (Sean Penn) patrolling the streets of East Los Angeles, trying hard to keep the gang violence between the Bloods, the Crips, and the Hispanic street gangs under control. Without spoiling the American police procedural action crime film, too much, this movie was infamous for its highly dangerous production, as film producer Robert H. Solo hired real gang members as guardians as well as actors. Two of them were shot during filming of this film. If that wasn't enough, according to the filmmakers, shortly after the church shooting scene wrapped, a church service a short distance away actually was disrupted by gang gunfire. Things got worse for the production, as reportedly, Sean Penn was arrested on 2nd April 1987 and spent close to a month (33 days) in jail for assault after hitting an extra on the set of this film who was taking snapshots of Penn without his permission. It also didn't help that he was going through a nasty public divorce with singer/actor Madonna, where the newspapers stated allegations of domestic abuse. Despite what happen behind closed doors and his private life, Sean Penn did pretty well in this role. Although, it wasn't much of a stretch, since Penn was a total angry wild-man at this time. Robert Duvall is also alright, but his role wasn't as superb to me, as other critics saw it. I just seen it, as average at best. However, he does fully earns the hallowed term actor's actor. Anyways, both of the main actors work well with each other, even if the whole 'bull and cows' (good cop/bad cop) gimmick seem to run them, as very unrealistic cops at the time. The supporting cast is just meh. Nothing much. It kinda sucks that they got Don Cheadle in this film, and barely used him. All, he does, is look menacing to the camera, and hardly speaks. He totally got wasted in his limited role as arch-gang leader, Rocket. I can also do, without Damon Wayans as Rocket's gang-member, T-Bone. All the comedy scenes with him, felt a little bit out of place like Courtney Gains's character, Whitey. If anybody, really shine in this film, it had to be Trinidad Silva as 21th Street gang leader, Leo 'Frog' Lopez. He was amazing as the informer. He really look like he belong in a real-life gang. It's too bad, that the actor died in 1988 in a car accident involving a collision with a drunken driver in Whittier, California, after filming this movie. I really hope for more from him. One thing that really made this film, very interesting is the odd mixer of gangsta rap music with that of classic 1960s country hits. It's weird, hearing Jaynett's 'Sally Go Around the Roses' & Willie Nelson 'Bloody Mary Morning' with the intense rap songs of Ice T's 'Colors' and Big Daddy Kane 'Raw'. It was so jarring to me. I guess, it's supposed to represented the large different between those, living in the white community and those living in the black projects of Los Angeles County in Color. However, the movie's music also shows the weird unionize of multiply ethnicities under the banner of those who choose to live, under the colors of law enforcement and those who choose to wear the colors of the street gangs. No matter what, the music for this film, kinda works for its plot; just as much as the location of LA, works for the soundtrack. You really do get the sense of gang-life and how it was like to be in the CRASH force. Nevertheless, I would love to see, how the original script that took place in Chicago and was more about drug dealing than gang members. It's just seems, more interesting. In addition to that, there is a version of the film that has an extended ending that is somewhat not checking out. Just don't watch that version, if you haven't saw the film, yet. Watch the theatrical cut. The new scenes are not that satisfying. Overall If you love movies like 2012's 'End of Watch' or 2001's 'Training Day', you will probably love this movie. While, it's not the best cop movie out there. This somewhat excellent, powerful and gripping crime drama is still worth checking out.

It was not only my first encounter (aside of Easy Rider) with a Dennis Hopper film but also my first encounter (aside of Fast Times at Ridgemont High) with a film from the 80s with Sean Penn in it. And I must say Penn is truly remarkable here as Officer Danny McGavin (aka Pac-man). I also must say that aside of few elements I liked Hopper's fourth directorial effort, it's good enough for a Saturday night. Set in Los Angeles the film show us the gangs, there's certainly Low Rider and revenges and killings. There are certainly some important plot points dealing with the gangs but this is the cops' show, this is the show of Robert Duvall and Sean Penn. We see them doing their daily work activities, the film takes the typical formula of having a veteran cop (certainly played by Robert Duvall) dealing with a rookie that acts as wild as he once acted and is mostly about Sean Penn's character and how it changes. The ending (with Pac-man taking the role of the experimented cop of Robert Duvall's character Bob Hodges) is the expected and the only possible one since we have a generic main story line. And certainly it may sound as a bad thing the word generic but pretty much while the film has a formula it still delivers interesting things and exciting moments. It also works because both Duvall and Penn are nothing less than great; it's really good and entertaining to see these couple of cops. But not all the acting is good. For instance, Maria Conchita Alonso is pretty bad as the love interest of Pac-man; her character, Louisa Gomez, is from the gang world and of course the fact that she is dating a cop will bring the typical plot points of having Pac-man being rejected because he is affecting Louisa's familiars by doing his job. It may not work the love part of the film but some other parts work perfectly like for instance the whole thing when Pac-man finally changes it may not be a total surprise of a plot point but having a character like Pac-man (for a reason I must say Penn was perfectly cast here) acting finally a bit more reasonable and still getting the blame (that in this world means being in dire straits) was a really good part for me.

A 'true account' about crime and life in the streets and how violence ripples through the social surface. It seems a little stale now, but only because the same clich√©s were repeated elsewhere, probably because true to begin with. But whereas the Japanese often cast actual yakuzas in their films, Noboru Ando for example was a yakuza underboss turned famous actor, here we get Sean Penn and Robert Duvall. They have some chemistry, one playing a James Dean wild child who always fusses about his hair, the other playing a snarling Robert DeNiro with a good heart, but they go a long way to ruin whatever attempts at stark realism.Which was a limited prospect to begin with. The various gangbangers look a short step away from the cartoonish punks that populate the Death Wish films. Actors dressed up as hoodlums. It doesn't help that Don Cheadle plays the gang leader.The first half is enjoyable for what it is, a buddy cop romp through the barrios where now and then we stop to mingle with suspect characters. By the end however, so many unimaginative scenarios have piled upon it in so little visual space to breathe that it doesn't matter much who lives or dies.

For those raised in the crime-infested atmosphere, could easily relate to the settings and the characters that are portrayed here. For those with knowledge about the Crypts and Bloods gang, this film gives an accurate almost nostalgic preview of these two rival gangs and what they faced everyday in their lives. But it's the humanity that this film offers that makes this film perfectly nuanced as opposed to the clich√©d gangster movies that makes them look like evil, deadbeat junkies. Though not primed as a director, Dennis Hopper does an exceptional job giving a grim reality of what the streets of Los Angeles looked like during the late 1980's to the early 1990's. Acting wise, Robert Duvall and Sean Penn work together as the old-cop/young cop duo as they try to control the streets of Los Angeles from these two feuding gangs. The contrasting mannerisms of these two cops is a great struggle within themselves. The laid-back Duvall can't seem to equal up to the uptight and determined Penn need to find trust between both of them if they wish to put a stop to these powerful gangs, which ends in a tragic finale. Though a bit dated, it still exceeds from those other stupid gangsters films these days. It remains the pinnacle to other gangster-related films like Menace to Society among others. What makes this movie special, is that it equals police life and gang life equally and doesn't go one-sided about it either.

C.R.A.S.H. unit that patrols gangland caused many a sensation when it was released in 1988. Community groups across the city of angels called the film controversial and even irresponsible, claiming that it was likely to stir up trouble and fighting due to its subject matter, and it did! At one of the premier screenings in Los Angeles suburbia, rioting broke out between two rival gangs.On the other end of the scale were those who praised the film for its bravery and honesty, saying that Colors was a powerful statement concerning the violence on the streets of LA I for one certainly can't dispute the film's controversy, however I would argue that often these type of movies sometimes have to be made before anybody will do anything about the situation. Take the 1978 film Midnight Express, about American Billy Hayes who was imprisoned in a Turkish jail. Both governments took immediate action after viewing that movie. And even if nothing comes of Colors, perhaps the population of the world will have benefited from the education it offers.While I would disagree that Colors is a powerful picture, it certainly is honest, and both screen writers Michael Schiffer and Richard Dilello, along with director Dennis Hopper, should be credited for broaching such a touchy subject.Sean Penn and Robert Duvall both give strong performances as the cops who find themselves at odds when it comes to handling the street hoodlums who poison the town with drugs and rule it with machine guns. Backing the two leads is a fine support cast, great hip hop music from Herbie Hancock, and sharp cinematography from Haskell Wexler.Colors is an accurate and often damning film about street gang violence which seems to suggest that trying to help these kids at their level may be more effective than fighting them head on.Sunday, July 17, 1994 - Video "}{"Title":"perhaps it isn't so cliched after all","Date":"28 January 2004","Score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Crime, Drama","Review":"  Perhaps that what seems like a very cliched film to some of you, wasn't all that cliched in........

The two officers are constantly butting heads over the proper way to handle the situations of the street and things don't get any better once the gangs start fighting back. COLORS was a very popular movie in the day but it's not really a great film. I think there are many very good and many great things in the film but I think a major re-write on the screenplay could have really helped things because no matter how many times I watch the film I can't help but think they're trying to do way too much and end up missing a lot of stuff that should have been simple. On one hand you're looking at a cop-buddy picture and then you have a film trying to show people the law of the streets. I'm sure many were seeing these type of gangs for the first time and director Hopper certainly tries to make one understand why they're in these gangs and why they're willing to lay down their blood for their cause. What doesn't work overly well are a couple side plots dealing with Penn and his relationship with a Mexican woman (Maria Conchita Alonso) with connections to the street. Another thing that doesn't work overly well are all sorts of other subplots dealing with lower entry gang members that never really add up to much. I think there are some moments where the film goes away from the two leads for too long, which certainly makes the film drag in spots. What does work however are the performances by those two leads with both actors doing a great job and even better is the chemistry they have together. The old school Duvall and the new school Penn were the perfect selection for partners here because their acting styles are just so different that they end up mixing together so well. No actor can sell a veteran as great as Duvall and Penn was certainly starting to come into his own around this point in his career and that hot-tempered manor of his was nailed perfectly. The supporting players add some nice performances including Ron Delaney, Larry Sylvester, Don Cheadle and Marlon Wayans in a small role. I've read some reviews that say COLORS is nothing more than a blaxploitation flick for white people but I think this is a tad bit unfair. I think Hopper did a very good job at showing this gang life without glamorizing it and I also think the film does a good job at making the members humans and not just some sort of targets. Hopper certainly seemed to know the material quite well and his direction gets the job done but I think less could have been more.

No, it doesn't glorify gang violence, but it does romanticize the thrill of the chase, with cars careening off each other while the boom boxes pound on the soundtrack. Sean Penn and Robert Duvall make a formidable acting team, playing two LA policemen battling each other as well as the gangs, each of them bringing a measure of depth to their stereotypical macho cop characters with typically intense performances. Meanwhile the script wanders all over the east LA barrios before finally pausing for a suitably tragic conclusion; screenwriter Michael Schiffer wisely passes no judgment and makes no attempt to put the problem of gang warfare into perspective, which is probably why some people were worried that the film itself might incite violence (it didn't).

Just seeing Robert Duvall and Sean Penn on the cover tempted me into purchasing it.  This is a gritty, realistic urban drama that escapes from Hollywood conventions.  Dennis Hopper wasn't concerned about grabbing the audience's attention with loads of intense action sequences and cheap melodrama.  There are indeed some truly violent scenes in this movie, but they are all necessary.  The characters are well-developed, and I can honestly classify this as a character-driven film.  We are familiar with the good cop/bad cop scenario in many police dramas.  I guess Duvall would be the good cop and Penn the bad cop.  But this is not meant simply to create conflict, but to bring out the richness of each character.  Duvall is an over-the-hill cop, who may not have the energy to run a half-a-mile to nab his perps, but he possesses great knowledge from being on the force for so long and he knows how to handle these gangsters in a disciplined, psychological manner without laying a finger on them.  There's a great monologue, in which he interacts with Penn during a cookout.  I don't remember the exact lines, but he tells him not to go too far, trying to beat the crap out of every perp he comes into contact with because he's gonna gain such a violent temper that God forbid he might even take out his aggression out on everyone he meets, including his wife.  Penn is a rookie cop who thinks the way to take care of these violent thugs is through violence and violence only.  He's a decent person; he just needs to realize that being Robocop is not in his job description.There are some moments that drag, but ultimately I admire Hopper from presenting this story from all angles  not just from the cops, but also from the gangs themselves.  This is an exciting, powerful film that works on many levels.  Robert Duvall is extraordinary, as always, but this must be one of his best performances.  He truly disappears into his multi-faceted character, as so does Penn.  I can tell they both researched their roles thoroughly, and they have a great chemistry together.  Of course, it's always a joy to watch two fine actors share the screen, but even two fine actors can have bad chemistry and that's not true in this case.  The old school rap music causes the film to be just a tad dated, but it didn't bother me too much.*************SPOILER AHEAD******************The ending, in which Duvall dies, is sad though somewhat predictable.  But even that wasn't handled in a Hollywood fashion.  And I especially admired the very last scene, where Penn takes Duvall's place as the experienced cop, training the new loose-cannon rookie cop.  Earlier in the film, Duvall tells Penn a story about a young bull, an old bull and a bunch of cows.  When Penn tells the story, he hesitates, forgetting exactly how the story goes and he gets the timing wrong.  In a more melodramatic film, Penn would've told the story flawlessly and the pretentious mood music would rise in the background.  But once again, Hopper went for realism.Colors is brutal, violent and packed with 4-letter words.  So if you're expecting a happy, feel-good movie--this definitely won't brighten your day. But if you want to be emotionally riveted, this is definitely the film for you.My score  8 (out of 10)  "},{"Title":"fantastic movie on gangs","Date":"26 April 2005","Score":"6 out of 12 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Crime, Drama","Review":" Strangely I had never heard of this movie until yesterday.I thought it was a great depiction of gang life in L.A. and I rank it up high with the other gang movies like Boyz N the Hood and Menace II Society.

All of those elements make Colors an unforgettable film that is Dennis Hopper.Sean Penn and Robert DuVall at their best.Set in Los Angeles,California,Colors tells the story of veteran LAPD cop Bob Hodges(Robert DuVall)who is teamed up with young hot shot cop Danny McGavin(Sean Penn)to patrol the streets and deal with local gangs such as the Crips,Bloods and Latino gangs while dealing with each other as partners.Before there was Boyz N The Hood(1991)and Menace II Society(1993)set the standard for Urban Drama in LA there was Colors a brilliant and intense Crime Drama that set the table and was also a mixture of amazing talents such as director Dennis Hopper and actors Sean Penn and Robert DuVall who all collaborated on this great film that was not only a critical and Box Office success but was also the right movie at the right time for Los Angeles in 1988. During the 1980s Los Angeles was known for being seen as such a beautiful place that was filled with glitz and glamour and the rich and famous,but Colors gave audiences a different side and look to Los Angeles that wasn't seen during the 1980s where parts of the city were not very pretty and gang violence was out of control with the cops trying to stop it but with little success. And while Colors is a obviously a more conventional movie than Dennis Hopper's landmark classic Easy Rider(1969)Colors is still an incredible film that is very underrated. Powerful,violent and at times shocking from beginning to end Colors is a film that punches viewers in the face with tons of grit and intensity that just never stops until the end credits roll. Colors is movie that combines elements of not only Crime Drama but also Action film,Gang movie and Cop drama into fascinating study of Gang life and violence seen from the points of view from both the cops and the gangs from the LAPD to the Crips and Bloods in South Central to the Latino gangs in East LA with tons of characters getting enough screen time. There is certain scenes with the gangs and cops that some will find a little over the top(and there is some funny moments in the film despite the serious subject matter)I think some of the scenes were pretty accurate about what was going on at the time on the mean streets of LA. The film while a study of gangs and gang violence is also a look at the partnership between McGavin and Hodges and how the two deal with gang bangers where as Hodges is more calm and friendly being the veteran,young McGavin while not a bad guy or a bad cop is more brutal and wants to busts all the criminals with an iron hand which Hodges doesn't agree with which makes them clash on how they do things. While it's the kind of thing people would see in a another movie(like in a Buddy Cop film)the dynamic and partnership between the two characters I think adds to the film. The violence in Colors is shocking and not for the weak at heart but is fitting for the tone and feel of the movie showing the harshness of being a Cop and a Gang banger. There is also a few scenes of Action that keeps the story moving and even an exciting car chase that gives the movie an energy. The ending of Colors is effective and powerful but brings the film full circle in many ways. A fantastic ending.The cast is great. Sean Penn and Robert DuVall are excellent as Danny McGavin and Bob Hodges,with Penn and DuVall showing great chemistry. Maria Conchita Alonzo is great and sexy as Louisa,Danny's girlfriend. Randy Brooks is sensational as Ron,a guy who works with gangs. Trinidad Silva is wonderful as Frog,the leader of 21st street gang. Grand L. Bush is good as Looney Tunes,Frog's friend. Glenn Plummer is fantastic as High-Top,a Blood gang member. Don Cheadle is effective as Rocket,a Crip gang member. Damon Wayans is funny as T-Bone,a member of the Crips.

I like how the film is ahead of its time, because only a few years later will gang brutality reach the headlines. But this is a well-acted and well- directed film that has an ordinary screenplay but ends up being a fun watch. Dennis Hopper's film is about a veteran cop named Bob Hodges who works as a member of the LAPD Crash Department which specializes in gang violence. He is charged with showing the much younger Danny McGavin the ropes of how the department operates. The acting is pretty good. Robert Duvall is always a steady veteran presence and he does a good job. Sean Penn, who always seem near breaking point, also does a good job complimenting Duvall. Don Cheadle, in one of his earlier roles, also manages to do a good job as the leader of one of the gangs. Overall, Colors may seem like an ordinary buddy cop film and in a sense it is, but the unique aspect is how it depicts gang violence and how it brings that issue to light.

This is the truest depiction of gangland L.A. you'll ever see. Sometimes it's too close for comfort. Aging, veteran L.A cop, Duvall and his new hot headed partner Mcgavin, nickname Pacman (a great written character for Penn-suitably brilliant, one would say) are after a killer, Rocket (a young Don Cheadle before he moved into more serious straight arrow characters) who's smoked a homie from another gang. Violence shown is occasional, sometimes heavy, but really when only necessary. Penn and Duvall form a great team, part of a unit called CRASH, crimes only related to gangland. Unlike Riggs and Murtaugh, they're always disagreeing, or getting into some heated arguments. It was great, the family scene, where Duvall invited Penn and his new date over for lunch after a quite thrilling car chase, where their squad car has just upturned. But too, one of my favourite scenes, was Duvall lecturing Penn in his backyard, about the hang ups Penn's future has in law enforcement, where Penn defends himself, arguing his points, totally the opposite of Duvall, who's like the mediator of the duo. Penn's points about not buttering up these homies, and not getting respect is true, but then again you have to gain respect, where Penn's character would have zero tolerance on that one. When Penn goes too far, like a cop having a bad day with these nemesis's, Duvall's retaliation, knocking Penn back in line, was truly something unexpected. It then has Penn, balking. This was truly a powerful moment. Damon Wayans was a hoot as a gang member parading shirtless, in a stereo place, bunny uniform and all, until his act is brought to a standstill. The whole near two hour movie has our dynamic duo, and other enforcers, trying to track down Rocket, that lead to interrogations, where we take delight in watching Mr Macho Penn, do his thing, one scene I would love to acted out. Also we have a sub plot, an accidental shooting that puts one cop on the stand, but also in an earlier scene we have one full frontal beaver shot, after a place is raided, Penn just stilted by the beautiful sight. The tragic finale is memorable in a great slow zoom upward shot, where not every cop tale ends well. This film is no doubt Hopper's piece of resistance, an undying portrait of L.A. how it should of really been shown. I highly advise you to give this 88 pic a viewing over. It's reality will hit you in the face.

It made me a bit uncomfortable at times, in a good way. It has some great chase scenes, and it's not overly violent, but it is violent. We get a pretty controversial scene which involves a drive by shooting at a church. That to me is really pushing the limit, and it made for a very effective scene. I did feel that the intensity could have been amped up a little more at times, than it was, despite a bit of a somber & clever ending. I also felt the subplot between Penn & Maria Conchita Alonso was otiose, and lacked any real emotion. It just felt like they wanted a quick romance in this film, without any proper thought. It was a major misfire, and ended up getting on my nerves. Casting Penn & Duvall as partners was a great choice. Their contrast of styles meshed together wonderfully. Sean Penn is excellent as the hotshot cop who is brash with all of the pent up anger. He comes close to being unsympathetic at times, but thankfully Penn doesn't overdo it.

Music is by Herbie Hancock and cinematography by Haskell Wexler.Danny McGavin (Penn) transfers to the LAPD C.R.A.S.H. unit and is teamed with wise old veteran Bob Hodges (Duvall). Thrust in the middle of the gang wars of L.A., McGavin finds his hot head approach to policing may not be the way forward.Causing a bit of a stir upon release, with its depiction of gang life and violence, Colors is not as incendiary as that early reputation suggests. It's solidly put together, has the odd throat grabbing scene and the message is loud and clear without banging us over the head. It's also note worthy that a deal of authenticity comes out in the script. However, were it not for the lead performances of Penn and Duvall then much of Colors would be rendered as significantly restrained.The two actors find great and believable chemistry whilst never resorting to twee buddy-buddy histrionics. It's this relationship that keeps Colors pulsing, their contrasting styles of policing keeping the character study interesting as the gang life axis fizzles to a near non event. Unfortunately, because the cop pairing is so strong, it means that a romance thread between McGavin and Louisa Gomez (Alonso) feels tacked on and the actress just isn't good enough to lift it away from pointless irritation.With the lead gang players too thinly drawn, it's hard to get a handle on what is meant to be bubbling under the surface of Colors. A shame because there's some good actors spread out in the cast. It's like Hopper set off to make a potent police procedural in the hot-bed of L.A. (filmed on location), but as Duvall and Penn (also making headlines off screen at this time!) began to hold court, he encouraged and stayed with that angle, thus it's not all it can be as intelligent filmic entertainment. Lead actors, a stunningly poignant finale and the sight of Damon Wayans in his underwear dancing with a giant cuddly bunny, ensure it's never dull!

Duvall is the experienced cop, still working the streets and counting the days to retirement. Penn, his rookie partner with a mean streak that borders on sadistic. Forced to work together, the two LAPD uniforms butt heads as they struggle to keep L.A.'s streets safe from the ever-worsening gang warfare.Colors shares similarities with To Live and Die in L.A. Though far less taut than Friedkin's signature cop film, Hopper's filming on the streets of inner-city L.A. brings loads of authenticity to the proceedings. And like Friedkin, Hopper puts the audience in the front seat during a great car chase, while the busts are in-your-face and manage to excite, even after so many intervening years. The result is a gritty cop movie that seeks to address the gang problems from both sides. Showcasing several familiar faces in their pre-fame days (Leon, Don Cheadle and Damon Wayans), and boasting a surprisingly effective Herbie Hancock score, Hopper's understated cop drama is a solid effort.7/10 "},{"Title":"An Introduction To The Gangs of LA.","Date":"18 February 2012","Score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Crime, Drama","Review":" Dennis Hopper has directed a thoroughly exoteric movie, accessible to anyone, with not a sign of any psychedelic trappings. An occasional line sounds improvised but otherwise it's conventionally done. It's not bad, either, and might be especially illuminating for people who live in isolated little towns like Deming, New Mexico.It's a story of two cops -- a youngish hothead and hard charger (Penn) and the more laid-back and experienced man on the brink of retirement (Duvall). Both of them get the job done.The plot has Bloods and Crips prominent in the first half. That's to introduce the good folk of Deming to the idea of rival gangs in Los Angeles. But the emphasis shifts to an unnamed barrio gang of Mexican youths led by Trinidad Silva, who calls everyone Homes, as short for home boy or home boys. It doesn't matter to Silva whether the term of address is used as a singular or plural. Everybody is Homes. Silva is fine in the role. He has an ambiguous relationship with Duvall's cop. He helps keep the barrio relatively peaceful, seeing to it that his Homes don't do much more than smoke some grass, do some crack, maybe boost things once in a while, and run up more than a dozen parking tickets. He keeps Duvall informed of what's up, while Duvall occasionally does him a favor in return. Trinidad Silva is fine in the role, but it's hard to tell how much range he had. (He's gone now.) He may have been a one-shot deal like Alfonso Bedoya, Gold Hat in The Treasure of the Sierra Madre. The production design is outstanding. This isn't downtown LA. Nobody drinks cocktails and lives in Malibu. These are seedy, shabby, desolate neighborhoods, alive with people in the way that some kitchen cabinets seem to be alive with cockroaches. And the graffiti is everywhere and in a multiplicity of form. Some is nicely organized into epic murals, if obvious. These are, after all, in the tradition of Diego Rivera and Jose Orozco, and David Siqueiros.Maria Conchita Alonso, a Cuban singer, is pretty, vivacious, and dispensable. There is a black preacher, Troy Curvey, Jr., who mightily deplores the drugs and violence that affect the neighborhood. He and the audience at the funeral have the call-and-response pattern down pat. The ritual is interrupted by a drive-by machine gunning. There is one other drive-by shooting and one or two climactic shoot outs. As I said, this movie is commercially oriented.Not as bad as I'd expected but I hope by now we don't really need this Introduction to Gang Warfare 101, not even in Deming. And, it's a little sad -- watching this, seeing the hills and the palms and the warm sunny climate -- I kept thinking of how tranquil and accommodating the Los Angeles basin was before the city got there. The Chumash Indians lived in nearby Santa Barbara. If you dig through their ancient garbage dumps, you find that they didn't change their way of life for more than three thousand years. Why should they? They had everything they needed. Now we couldn't do without a fleet of patrol cars, that palladium of civilization.

For those under say 30 in the 80s the urban (read non-white) areas in Los Angeles were beset by crime, both petty and more serious. Two rival gangs rose up and at their peaks had many thousand members each who despised any members of the rival gangs&#x85; all of them despised the cops even worse.A brief preamble shows that the gangs numbered greater than 70,000, the cops 250. Not good odds.The two gangs were called the Crips and the Bloods and were distinguishable by the Colours that they worse, Crips were blue, the Bloods were obviously Red. As Ice T says in the theme song Wear the wrong colour and your life might end&#x85; The gang members even had to be kept separate in prison or else they would kill each other there! In the midst of all this were simply not enough cops charged with maintaining the peace, keeping drugs off the streets and preventing the two gangs from killing each other. Drive by shootings were a constant threat and violent crime was rife.Colours mostly follows two cops. The experienced and soon to retire McGavin (Robert Duvall) and new gung-ho, hotheaded rookie Hodges (Sean Penn). McGavin knows the streets and the right people on both sides of the law, Hodges just wants results quickly, and thinks McGavin is past it and should get out of his way. In the early scenes this tense dynamic comes to a head on more than one occasion as they jostle for control. Each of the two have their own moments of success and failure, they bicker and fight at times, each thinking the other has a lot to learn.Colours is less about a series of defined events than it is a month or two in the life of a couple of cops, they perform the normal duties that I must assume were required in the era, patrols, raids, questioning suspects and generally striving to keep the peace when all around resent them &#x96; even those they are trying to protect. McGavin has a strong relationship, almost a friendship with certain known gang members who give him snippets of information, in return he seems to leave them alone to take care of themselves.Eventually though the partners find themselves on the wrong side of some particularly naughty gang bangers (who include Don Cheadle and Damon Wayans), and they are subsequently targeted. Again this is not so much built up as a major plot development but handled as a logical outcome to providing resistance to violent criminals.The same thing that makes Colours hard to describe is actually its strength, this is not a car-chase&#x85; shootout&#x85; manhunt&#x85; shootout&#x85; big explosion film with snappy one-liners and a huge bodycount, but a more realistic imagining of a period in time as seen by a couple of cops. By necessity it does contain elements as mentioned above but they never seem forced or simply there for entertainment value.Colours is reasonably low key, gritty at times and deliberately paced. It is by no means the definitive LA Gang's film (Boyz in the Hood) but it is an interesting couple of house with solid performances and a fairly believable plot. You could do a lot worse.And to think Dennis Hopper made it!!! Final Rating &#x96; 6 / 10. Nothing mind-blowing, but a solid urban cop drama that is never boring.

It is as close to capturing the essence of desperate, dead-end life on the streets of the big city as it gets. In today's times, with increased cultural sensitivity and zero tolerance for racism, it is unlikely that this film would be made. Perhaps we as a society see things differently today, but the sad truth is that nothing has changed on these same streets. Death, brutality, intimidation, drugs, and gangs are alive and well on the streets of L.A. and other locales. Perhaps policing has changed also, with the no-nonsense brutality represented by Sean Penn's character seen today as an arcane thing of the past...But maybe not... Officers still have to navigate places where their lives mean nothing and there is no respect for the job.The film wrestles with a number of timeless issues on both sides of the badge, is accurate in portraying the codes that exist between and among gangs and cops, and conveys the sense of revolving door justice still present throughout the judicial system. Good job by Dennis Hopper.

There is action, drama and funny scenes. But what makes it so good, is that it is realist (I think, i'm not a LA cop !), not like classic cops movies like Tango and Cash or Lethal Weapon (even if they're good) The pursuit (after the church battle) is totally perfect, everything seems calculated. The arrestations are excellent too, you see a lot of techniques used by the cops (like the chopper or the radio com) And it's not a good vs bad movie, you see the life of the gangs, creeps and bloods, and you understand their problems.My favorite scene is when Danny and Hodges try to arrest High top for the second time, the moto ride is crazy and the fight in the restaurant , very good too.Now, what about the actors ? Well, they are just amazing ! Robert Duval is perfect in his role of an old cop who've seen everything and try to avoid gunshots. Sean Penn is excellent in his role of young violent cop. The two characters are totally different, but they must work together, they will learn from each other.

One of the original gang films, extremely realistic (which can only be a good thing in this genre), unrelenting, starring Sean Penn and Robert Duvall, directed by the great Dennis Hopper, and even one of Don Cheadle's earlier roles. Unfortunately, there is almost nothing at all great about this film. Robert Duvall delivers a powerful performance as the aging and disillusioned gang-beat cop, but even Sean Penn didn't do anything memorable with his role. Don Cheadle, similarly, had nothing to do in the his role but sit around and look depressed. Penn is a great actor, as is Duvall, but he just wasn't given much to work with. Consider, for example, the purely one-dimensional character that Penn is partnered with at the end of the film. Purposely meant to look one-sided and simple-minded, and this is the exact character that Penn was supposed to play for the majority of the film. He has a little transformation at the end of the film where he recites an old adage that Hodges (Duvall) once told him, but the very little character change that occurs in him takes place all at once and not until the last 3 minutes or so of the film.Hopper's direction is less than spectacular. Dennis Hopper has acted vastly more than he has directed, but even his stunning success with Easy Rider would make me expect more than this from him. The direction is routine and nothing more, and there are even several points in the film where the editing is downright bad. I realize that editing is not directing, but in my own experience as a professional filmmaker, editing and directing are VERY closely related, if not the same thing. The director is completely powerless unless he has some influence on the editing process, which was badly botched at several points in the film. Colors is an exercise in gangland clich√©s rather than a truly moving and affecting film. There is a thin plot strung along a series of scenes with Officers Hodges and McGavin (Penn) patting down long lines of gang members on their knees or in cuffs. It seemed like every 10 minutes of the movie had 3-5 scenes of a lot of gangsters getting searched or stopped or questioned or thrown into a police car or jail cell. Yes, I understand that this is a gangland movie and altercations between the police and the gangs are expected, but there comes a point where there are so many of these scenes that you just stop caring and they stop having any affect on you.There's a scene in this movie where a young gang member screams WHY? WHY? after a girl gets killed in a drive-by shooting at a gang party. In another scene, a young kid decides after seeing a friend killed that that's it, he's had it, he just has to join a gang in order to get revenge. A veteran gang member then turns to his fellow gangbangers, thoughtfully asking them if they should allow him in, and then dramatically tells the kid that first they have to see how much heart he has. This kid's grown up in this atmosphere his entire life and was on a track that lead nowhere other than to a gang (isn't that the point of the whole movie? That these people join gangs because it's the only thing available to them?), so three guys start beating on him, as is the standard Hollywood clich√©. Afterward, the older gang member puts his arm around the kid like a proud father, telling him that it's done, there's no turning back now. I understand that a movie like this has to have some amount of dramatic impact, but could they not have come up with a way to accomplish this other than with the usual gang movie fodder? You know, it's true that this movie came before many of the more famous gang movies, but Stand and Deliver came out before Colors, and that film was able to be vastly more powerful, and it completely avoided all of the gang movie clich√©s, it even went completely the other way in a lot of ways. Some of the stuff in this movie (such as in the paragraph above) reminded me of the fact that Hollywood has popularized the notion that in Roman times, fallen Gladiators were killed or given mercy depending on a thumbs up or thumbs down signal. This is purely an invention of Hollywood, as is much of the gangland content of this film. I'll be the first to admit that I have never lived in such an intensely gang-infested area as is depicted in the movie, but it's not hard to tell which scenes are completely contrived by Hollywood. Colors could very well have been a much better movie than it is, and maybe it was received a lot better by audiences in 1988 than it would be today, but it does not stand the test of time very well at all. The soundtrack alone is just about enough to reduce the film to a cheesy comedy, but even with the strong cast it is not able to come off as more than a mildly interesting crime film.

Originally scripted by Richard Di le Lello changes were demanded by the director who brought in screenwriter Michael Schiffer who changed the location and emphasised gang life in the ghetto . In many ways it's a precursor to the  anti-gangster  films of the early 1990s like BOYZ IN DA HOOD and MENACE TO SOCIETY . Unfortunatetly by trying to make a realist film this works against the movie One of the fundamental aspects of realist cinema is casting unknowns . Hopper prided himself on casting real LA gang members in walk on parts , but this is negated by having two very well known actors in the lead roles as beat cops both of whom are written as the old clich√©d  hard bitten cop who knows how the streets work  and  young cop who doesn't but he still wants to make a name for himself  . Duvall does of course do the best with the material he's given but Penn is distracting . Watching the film more than 20 years after it was released might actually improve your opinion of Penn since he's a double Oscar winning actor who's considered amongst the best actors of his generation . Not so in 1988 when his only real claims to fame was that he would often assault anyone who annoyed him and was married to Madonna There is another another aspect that stops the film from being realist cinema and that is the soundtrack . Usually a realist film has no incidental score but here we get an often intrusive in your face music soundtrack . It's interesting how so many films from the 1980s give the impression that the most important aspect to a movie was the music which dates COLORS along with making it difficult to describe it as being either realist or a star vehicle commercial film "},{"Title":"Lame and unengaging by today's standards","Date":"3 June 2004","Score":"9 out of 20 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Crime, Drama","Review":" Colors has surprisingly little to say. 90% of the film reel is spent on repetitive incidents (split between drive-by shootings and interrogations) interspersed with clich√©d conflicts between Old Wise Cop and Young Smartass Cop.
