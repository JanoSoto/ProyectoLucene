I've read about him before, and from memory, he was an exceptional martial artist (he practiced Hung-Gar) and became a folk-hero to the people of China, much like his father, Wong Kei Ying. So there is the true story, and then there is the 200 or so movies made about him. 'Drunken Master' is one of these.I haven't seen most of those 200 movies, except for the Drunken Master movies, Jet Li's 'Once Upon a Time in China' series, and 'Iron Monkey'. The 'Once Upon a Time in China' movies and 'Iron Monkey' may be somewhat over-the-top wu xia movies, but they portray Wong Fei Hung as a serious hero. 'Drunken Master' features a very different take on the character.Jackie Chan's Wong Fei Hung is a rebellious trouble-maker. His father, Wong Kei Ying, has given up on disciplining him, and sends him to his uncle, So Hai, the master of drunken boxing, hoping that a year of training with So Hai will sort Fei Hung out. Fei doesn't seem to learn his lesson until a chance encounter with Thunderfoot (Hwang Jang Lee)...Story-wise, it is a bit of a standard kung-fu plot. However, in a documentary on Jackie Chan (I can't remember the name, I know that as of this review, it isn't listed on IMDb, but it was shown on SBS in 2003), 'Drunken Master' was mentioned as his breakthrough hit that nearly killed his career Apparently Chinese viewers were insulted by Jackie's portrayal of Wong Fei Hung and nearly boycotted him when he was just gaining fame as an actor.Onto more important matters. Like kung-fu. 'Drunken Master' is one of the kung-fu classics. Boosted by the presence of martial-arts star Hwang Jang Lee, this pretty much made or solidified the careers of Jackie Chan and Yuen Woo Ping (in his directorial debut). 'Drunken Master' features some very well choreographed fights and training scenes. 'Drunken Master' is very funny too, and is one of two movies I know where a young main-character gets beaten by an older middle-aged lady (which is always funny, more movies need a scene like this) - the other movie is Battlefield Baseball.As a matter of interest for Jackie Chan fans 'Drunken Master' signaled the end of Jackie Chan's work with director Wei Lo. Yay. In fact, the Columbia Tristar DVD release of 'Drunken Master' includes audio commentary by experts on Hong Kong cinema. I will check that out sometime, but it sounds like it would appeal to fans of kung-fu movies. Some more trivia - the latest release doesn't have the complete Cantonese sound track, and so the English dub is used where the Cantonese track is incomplete.'Drunken Master' features awesome kung-fu scenes, and has some interesting historical perspectives. Ah, kung-fu movies and history, some of my favourite hobbies together at last - 10/10, a must see for any fans of Jackie Chan or kung-fu movies, 'Drunken Master' is kung-fu perfection.

One way we know this is that there are some two dozen films made in the late '70s- early'80's designed to imitate Snake in Eagle's Shadow, and only a couple imitate this film. By the time Drunken Master had become legendary world-wide, the chop-socky cycle (to which it still belongs, to an extent) had passed into history, and Chan himself had abandoned historical 'fu films for contemporary comedy-thrillers.It should be noted that the idea of making a film based on the early years of Wong Fei Hong was not original to Chan; at roughly the same time this film was being made, well-known martial arts choreographer Liu Chia Leung made a straight (non-comic) version of the story (without drunken boxing) over at Shaw Brothers, Challenge of the Masters, with Gordon Liu as Wong Fei Hung.The defining moment for the Chan-Yuen version of the film is the use of Drunken Boxing. There is no real evidence that the historical Wong Fei Hung was a master of this style; his more famous innovations involved the development of the shadowless hand technique and the no-shadow kick. Interestingly, in order to highlight Chan's use of Drunken Boxing, these other two techniques, better identified with Wong, are assigned in the film to the villain, Thunderlegs played by Hwang Jen Lee.At any rate, it would not be clear that one could consider this a Wong Fei Hung film at all - if it weren't for the fact that this film effectively redefined the Wong legend, so that it has since become pro-forma to assume that Wong was a bit wild in his youth. (Just to set that record straight, Wong was actually extremely studious, and recognized as a real child-prodigy in the martial arts, winning his first major public duel at the age of thirteen.) Drunken Master is solid martial arts entertainment. There are decided weaknesses in the plot and over-all staging of the film, but these can easily be ignored, as the film thrusts us along with kung fu and comedy to the grand final fight at the end. It must also be noted that these characters - even the villain - are well acted and quite likable and familiar, and thus add a credibility to the film. And Yuen's direction is also very professional and a couple notches above the average for a Hong Kong genre film of the time.Lives up to its own legend, and well-worth the viewing.

That loud whip-cracking noise whenever someone threw a blow, or got it blocked or hit someone. And there was also that wind cutting noise whenever someone threw a strike or moved their hands or feet. Besides these little annoyances, this was a great movie.I actually tried to see if there were teachers that could teach me Drunken Boxing, but I found out the style can take many years to learn as it requires much former training in previous martial arts.

Jackie Chan paid his dues many times over and nowhere is it more evident than here, in one of his earliest efforts. While he would go on to do the spectacular LEGEND OF THE DRUNKEN MASTER (in which he literally brought the house down), DRUNKEN MASTER also showcases his many and varied talents to great effect. Watching him being put through his (often excruciating) paces makes one aware of the years of preparation that had to go into his training. And while his characters are more often than not put through the proverbial ringer physically, it's the mental and emotional pounding they take that makes them so sympathetic (see NEW POLICE STORY, in which Chan and his young co-stars go through the tortures of the damned before the final showdown).

DRUNKEN MASTER is the perfect balance between action and humor, and the story is pure fun from start to finish.SPOILER WARNING!!!Sort of a remake of the previous year's SNAKE IN THE EAGLE'S SHADOW (which was again sort-of-remade right after this one as THE FEARLESS HYENA), DRUNKEN MASTER tells the story of Freddy Wong (Wong Fei Hung in the original Chinese), the troublemaking son of a martial arts teacher, who is simply incapable of not getting into fights. At his wits' end, his father calls in his Freddy's uncle, the infamous Sam Tse, to discipline the boy. Sam Tse also happens to be a master of the eight drunk gods technique, which is fueled by Herculean ingestion of wine. When a drunken master gets loose, God help anyone foolish enough to fight him!!!Freddy's training is so harsh that it could be seen as torture, so Freddy runs away because he is too lazy to learn it. Besides, he already knows his dad's style of kung fu, right? He promptly runs into a killer-for-hire who teaches the kid a humiliating lesson in the art of ass-whuppin'. He also engages Freddy in one of the all-time classic exchanges in a genre that is replete with classic exchangesBAD GUY- Hmmph! Who teaches you that kung fu? FREDDY (proudly)- My dad does! BAD GUY- Hmmph! Judging by your kung fu, he's useless! I wouldn't hire him to wipe my ass!!! (He then seriously kicks Freddy's sorry butt)After that, Freddy trains hard in the eight drunk gods, and his transformation is a joy to behold. The sequence in which Jackie demonstrates seven of the eight forms is a jaw-dropping display of what a highly-trained martial artist/acrobat can do. YOU WILL BE AMAZED. Highly recommended, and whatever  you do, don't miss Jackie's fight with an old lady in the middle of the street (old school kung fu fans, you know the rule if the person is really old, DO NOT FIGHT THEM!!!), and his drunken-style fight with the king of sticks.

This movie will have you rolling in your seat with laughter. Seriously, it has elements of The Three Stooges and balletic Keaton-like stunt-work so that in essence, Drunken Master is the perfect action-comedy.Directed by Yuen Wo Ping, who would later become well-known to American audiences for his work on the Matrix films and the Kill Bill flicks, Chan stars as an undisciplined troublemaker who happens to be an expert martial artist. When his father disowns him following an incident with a close relative, Chan goes and finds apprenticeship with a drunkard hermit, who teaches him the ancient kung-fu fighting style of drunken boxing.For those that don't know, drunken boxing (a.k.a. drunken fist or drunken master), as the title would imply, is a martial arts style that utilizes the staggering, unfocused movements of the typical drunkard. Chan exercises the movements gracefully in one training sequence, and it's one of the most effective fighting techniques though one may need to have an incredibly flexible body to master it. Because of the apparently unfocused posture of the fighter, his movements are concealed from the opponent, making it nearly impossible to anticipate his strikes. (To be able to use the style though, I'm not sure if one needs to be genuinely intoxicated to master its movements.)Chan eventually masters the techniques taught to him, and then uses his newfound skills to battle a lethal assassin who has since arrived to collect a price on his father's head.I don't know what it is exactly that made me enjoy this picture so much. The character Chan plays has been the object of Chinese folklore for nearly two centuries, but he would later find more serious film characteristics in the Once Upon a Time in China movies with Jet Li. Drunken Master shows why Chan is the star he is today. The film captures his talents masterfully and is forthright in its execution of his hyper-active skills in the many fighting sequences.I guess time has been good to Drunken Master, since it's appeared on several all-time favorite lists for martial arts movies.10/10 "},{"Title":"One of the Quintissential Martial Arts Movies","Date":"30 July 2015","Score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Comedy","Review":" When I was a kid, I watched the animated TV show Jackie Chan Adventures everyday before school.

Beggar Su's techniques are harsh but very effective, so when an assassin named Thunderfoot (Hwang Jang Lee) is hired to kill Fei-Hung's father, the young man is able to step in and save the day.Jackie Chan's comedic style is very much in evidence here, with buffoonery, slapstick action, and fart and poo gags, plus quite a few characters with peculiar facial features (a hairy mole, a red nose, drawn on freckles and goofy teeth), and the humour will not appeal to all (I nearly always struggle with Chinese comedy). Thankfully, the excellent fighting more than makes up for the silliness, with Jackie performing some mind-bogglingly amazing feats of physical prowess, making the absolute most of his Chinese Circus training. He leaps, he flips, he tumbles, he kicks, and he punches, performing snake style, monkey style and&#x97;of course&#x97;drunken style, all with incredible energy, speed and split second timing; it's absolutely breathtaking to behold.Naturally, Beggar Su and Thunderfoot are no slouches in the chop socky department either, the old drunken beggar pulling off some very cool moves against a baddie called The Stick King (Hsia Hsu) and Thunderfoot more than living up to his title with his technique 30% hands and 70% legs, Hwang Jang Lee is given plenty of opportunity to show off his legendary kicking skills. Also very impressive in her small role as Wong Fei Hung's auntie is Linda Lin Ying I don't know much about her, but the one fight scene she shares with Jackie is quite stunning&#x97;her flexibility and leg control made my jaw drop (I must check out some of the other titles in her filmography&#x97;Dance of the Drunk Mantis also stars Hwang Jang Lee, so that would seem like an obvious place to start).

The star features of the movie, however, are Jackie Chan and the fight sequences. Chan is in great form here, and goes all out in his fights, fights that are simply amazing (and amusing) to behold.

I'd love to be able to find a subtitled copy, but no sense in carping. The fight scenes are not only very exciting, but innovative as well. Some of the training sequences had me in awe. It makes Jean-Claude Van Damme looks a bit tame in comparison. I was especially impressed with Jackie's incredible ability to maintain his balance, while acting as a drunk. It was very convincing. Jackie's charm is undeniable, even when he's grossly pigging out on food. Some may find his arrogance a bit overbearing, but I didn't. I wouldn't call it a great performance, but he's fun. Siu Tin Yuen is absolutely tremendous and great fun. His chemistry with Chan was just excellent. The villain is rather plain, but he fits the bill, and is there to be menacing. The end fight is lengthy and absolutely marvelous. Final Thoughts It's just a lot of fun for a martial arts film at this stage. If you're a big Jackie fan, or a martial arts fan there is no excuse. You must see it.

The plot's pretty basic - Chan's undisciplined young future folk hero Wong Fei-Hung has to learn 'Drunken' kung fu to take on a killer - but it's just there to provide enough of a excuse to allow a comic action scene every reel or so, most of them wonderfully ingeniously choreographed and just great fun. It's not a deep film or a deathless masterpiece, even though it is almost perfectly directed by Yuen Woo-Ping it's just a pure entertainment that manages to be purely entertaining in the very best way.the DVD releases, sadly, are problematic. Sony's release doesn't have the plethora of extras from Hong Kong Legends' original UK released, but unlike that version is in the right widescreen ratio - 2.351 instead of HKL's 1.851. The opening fight is still cut due to negative damage and parts of the original Cantonese soundtrack are missing (replaced by the odd bit of English), but the film really benefits from being seen in the right ratio, showing off the stunts much more comfortably. The only real extra is a commentary from Ric Mayers and Jeff Yang carried over from Sony's Region 4 Astralian disc (which also included the similarly entertaining Snake in the Eagle's Shadow), but it's still the best version of the film itself available to date.

The first major martial arts film since the great Enter the Dragon.Set in Hong Kong, Freddie Wong (Jackie Chan) is a skilled material artists, but a young man who often gets in trouble, fighting with his instructor, flirting with a young woman and beating up a young thug. His father a kung-fu school owner tries to install discipline on his son but fails, so recruits the services of So Chan (Siu Tien Yuen), a notorious instructor who forces Freddie into a tough regime. Freddie even attempts to run away from So Chan, but ends up running into Thunderleg (Jang Lee Hwang), a skilled assassin and insults Freddie's father and his teaching techniques. After that Freddie goes back to So Chan and demanded to work hard with material arts, and learn So Chan's techniques. The two even form a friendship and work together whilst fighting.After the unfortunate death of Bruce Lee, Hong Kong cinema entered into the brief period of Bruceploitation where lookalikes attempted to make martial arts films, many failed. Jackie Chan did martial arts very differently, he made them comic, and the fights in Drunken Master were slapstick in nature. Some are very comical, but they are all well done and exciting to watch. Like Bruce Lee, Jackie Chan is a skilled Martial Artist and possibly the man closest to him in the film world in skill terms. Like any film they is a villain in the piece, Thunderleg who gives Jackie Chan a good challenge at the end. That scene in itself is worth watching. The plot is pretty simple, but who cares? Its still stronger then some of what Hollywood can product.The major problem with the film is some of dubbing. I hate dubbing and the fact that when the characters do speak in English they sound American, not Chinese. Also some of the humour is not to my taste.But Drunken Master is a worthy film for Martial Arts fans, especially during the golden period of the 70s.

The story fits well with the character, although it is nothing new even at that time and somewhat redundant if you come to your senses, that is if you can. This film barely gives you time to think as one fighting scene leads to another and the next thing you know you're already watching the final fight.Yuen Woo Ping makes alibis for every action sequence by having Fei Hung walk into situations and starting a fight. It's not a deduction in my criteria, in fact I find it amusing how come up with these things.The characters in the film are in no way uninteresting either. From the supporting actors to the main cast they deliver the effect that is needed for a particular scene. The only problem I had with this was that Fei Hung's aunt should have played a bigger role in Fei Hung's lessons. Maybe she could have made an appearance at the climax.Jackie really showed a lot of promise in this movie and look at him during the 80's and 90's. It's just sad to see him doing mediocre-rated movies nowadays. "},{"Title":"Martial Art Classic","Date":"4 August 2005","Score":"","Genre":"Action, Comedy","Review":" After the local success of Snake in the Eagle's Shadow, Seasonal Studios decided to follow it up with another kung fu comedy. The new film would use much of the same plot, director (Yuen Woo-ping) actors and, of course, Jackie Chan. The difference would be an irreverent look at the growing up of the legendary Wong Fei Hung a famous herbalist, teacher, physician and kung fu practitioner of Hung Gar. This character has been portrayed in a plethora of films and would continue to be though for many this character is synonymous with Kwan Tak-hing and the original series of 99 films he portrayed him in. According to Jackie, ...rather than show him as a heroic adult, we would explore what he was like as a young man before he grew into his legend &#150; lazy, naive, ignorant, and rebellious. This humanizing of a legend, immensely popular in Chinese culture, allowed people to relate to this story and it was a gigantic hit. It is one of my favorite Kung Fu comedies and along with Fist of Fury (American title The Chinese Connection) one of the most beloved of the Hong Kong Kung Fu films.Jackie stars as Wong Fei Hung a troublesome teenager who cannot please his father the venerable Wong Chi-Ying (played by the venerable Lam Kau who seems more like his father than Ti Lung in Drunken Master II), the master of the Po Chi Lam studio and clinic. He goofs off, picks on Dean Shek (in a familiar role) and attacks his Aunt. The fight scene where he takes on actress Linda Ling Ying (unknowingly his Aunt at the time) is excellent because of her flexibility and martial art skill. Too bad it is so short. But this confrontation and other misgivings eventually leads to Chi-Ying hiring Su Hua-Chi to train, a nomadic and curmudgeon man who has been rumored to maim and destroy his students. Hua-Chi was played by Simon Yuen, the director's father, who was nearing the end of his career though rising in popularity. He brought a sadistic yet comedic touch to the role of the elder master of the drunken style.Wong did not want to train under such a wicked man, so he ran away from home. Unfortunately, Su saved him from a massive beating after Jackie could not pay for the food he ate at a restaurant. Fei Hung later realized that the old beggar who saved him was the old man who was supposed to torture and school him in the martial arts. Wong did not like the initial training so he ran away after tricking Sifu Su into a water container. While trying to dry his clothes he ran into Thunderleg (the awesome Korean kicker Hwang Jang Lee) who mercilessly beat him and made him crawl between his legs for being impertinent and not leaving his dingy area. This upset him, but what angered him the most (this seemed funny) was that he burnt his clothes. After being destroyed physically and emotionally he went back to Master Su to train some more.Like many of the earlier Kung Fu films Chan's training sequences are awesome to behold. Jackie being in excellent shape and having masochistic tendencies brought on from his younger days under Yu Jim-yuen, would be tortured by Sifu Su by being his puppet, doing upside down sit-ups while bringing small water cups from barrels below to barrels above and a variety of evil exercises to get him into excellent shape. Though Kung Fu columnist Ric Meyers has stated that the training scenes, and other scenes from this film especially the beginning fight scene between Thunderleg and Chen Kuo-Wei, were originally a lot longer but the original print has possibly been lost.This training was so Wong Fei Hung could learn the secret of the Eight Drunken Gods. Wong learnt all of these fluently, while being inebriated, (along with the snake and crane forms he already knew) except the Miss Ho forms which he felt was sissy, though in later films Jackie would have no problems fighting as a woman --Young Master.All of the training, scenery and Cantonese comedy is fun to watch, but the main reason most people love this film is because of the awesomely choreographed and directed martial art scenes. The highlight is the sublime showdown with Thunderleg. It is Chan's Drunken style versus Hwang's Tae Kwon Do (Jackie calls this his fourth favorite fight scene in I am Jackie Chan. Hwang's use of the Devil's Kick and the Devil's Shadowless Hands is superb with his adroitness. I also like the fight scene with the Bamboo King (Hsu Hsia) and, well, just about all of them and there is a lot in this nonstop action film (yes I even like the fight with Bolo look alike Lee Chun Wa).This film was so successful that it helped ignite Jackie's career (made him 50,000 HK dollars) and gave more recognition to Yuen Woo-ping whose contribution to this film is Titanic. Drunken Master influenced many future HK films (of course Drunken Master's plot was not original either) and helped HK get over it post-Bruce depression. This film also influenced directors such as Quentin Tarantino who made his actors on Kill Bill watch scenes from this movie. It is also responsible for another great martial art film &#150; its sequel. Though the irony is that this film was only initially seen in grindhouse theaters and occasionally mentioned in martial art magazines; it was not seen as much by western audiences until Legend of Drunken Master (Drunken Master II) came out.

Wong Fei Hung (Jackie Chan's character) was a very popular character to feature in martial arts films. I know I have seen at least ten or so movies where Wong Fei Hung was mentioned or the lead role. The difference in this movie is what kind of character Wong Fei Hung was portrayed as. Usually Wong Fei Hung is portrayed as a noble fighter or a great doctor or both; a character deserving of much respect. In this film, he is seen as a wise-cracking prankster who has little regard for his kung fu training. This was unheard of when is came out and is probably one of if not the only film Wong Fei Hung is portrayed as such. As far as the comedy, one really has to have a love of Martial Arts comedy to enjoy this film. I personally love it. It may be just slapstick comedy to some, but I'd give it three out of five stars.

Shaming his family, Wong is driven from the nest to suffer under the tutelage of a drunken uncle who happens to be a master of the fighting styles of the Eight Drunken Gods.Enduring excruciating exercises does not prove worth it to young Wong until he encounters Thunderfoot who beats the daylights out of him in a fight. Returning to his uncle, or Drunken Master, Wong finishes his training just in time to face Thunderfoot again, this time for keeps.As a casual watcher of Kung Fu films as opposed to a true devotee, I would highly recommend this movie for its humor, interesting fights, and often hilarious English Dub Track. The current DVD Release available through Amazon and other outlets (I found my copy for 9.99 in the big bin at Wal-mart) has a few flaws. Portions of the original soundtrack are missing, so dubbed-in english is substituted. Some of the renderings are just hilarious. However, the print is much improved over the old VHS release from 6 or 7 years ago.At this point I have to comment on Jackie Chan's performance. The guy is simply a master of physical comedy. Chan is easily the equal of Harold Lloyd or Buster Keaton -- every bit as daring and imaginative. Couple that with his martial arts skills and engaging personality and you have a modern marvel of cinema. I think Jackie Chan could well be the most accomplished master of physical comedy in movie history. He is THAT good.Add to this the fact that Yuen Wo Ping directed this film. This is the same Wo Ping who later choreographed fight scenes for The Matrix series, as well as Crouching Dragon and Kill Bill.No, Drunken Master is not, of itself, a masterpiece. It is a flawed but honest low-budget kung-fu flick with a load of good humor thrown in. I give it a solid 3.5/4 stars, and heartily recommend it for an enjoyable evening of good-hearted movie thrills and laughs, as well as for an early look at the work of a couple of real masters.

Its famous fancy gun play and choreographed flight scenes attracted a huge amount of attention from international viewers. Bruce Lee effectively established Asian martial art films back in 1970s, it was the reboot of the Hong Kong film industry and soon the martial art films became very popular. Then Kung Fu films are stamped Oriental identity. The Hong Kong film industry reached its golden time between 1986 and 1992. It had the third largest film production after India and the United States. Many of us get to know Jackie Chan in the Hollywood action comedy blockbuster Rush Hour in 1998. This film made a star of Jackie Chan internationally. Jackie Chan entered Hollywood after he succeeded in the Hong Kong film market by his martial art/ Kung Fu performances. Many western viewers were introduced by Bruce Lee to Chinese Kung Fu - Asian martial art films. Hence a lot of people compare Jackie Chan with Bruce Lee's performances. In earlier days Jackie Chan was not actually doing much acting in the action films. He was a stuntman in Bruce Lee's film New Fist of the Fury and Enter the Dragon. Later on he was discovered by a film maker and tried to promote his Kung Fu performance which differentiated him from Bruce Lee's This is Chinese Kung fu image. His first breakthrough &#x96; Drunken Master in the Hong Kong film market earned him high ratings from Chinese audiences. It is one of the earliest action comedies that stared Jackie Chan. This film is no exception to his other action comedies &#x96; hilarious and loads of fun. It has to be a Kung Fu fans' favorite movie. The fights are inspiring for the ordinary viewers like me. Silly jokes make this film work. It involves many different and difficult Kung Fu styles and techniques. It can be classified as one of Chan's pure martial art performance films. The story is based on a Chinese hero Wong Fei Hung. What we do know about him is that he is born in Guangdong Fo Shang in Qing Dynasty and he is a Kung Fu master. There are at least 200 films made in China based on this man. Drunken Master is more like a fiction movie with a comedy twist. It is set in later Qing dynasty before the Japanese invasion. As we know, Qing government is pretty corrupt and the poor get bullied by the rich. Therefore a hero is created to save the poor and the weak. Wong's dad is also a Kung Fu Master, different from the style that Wong was taught. He is kind and brave and he teaches young men in the village to protect themselves. He wants his own son to be the same as him, but Wong Fei Hung is too naughty to be taught by his own dad. The story is mainly about the young Wong Fei Hung played by Jackie Chan and how he is transformed by his master Su Hua Zi and becomes successful in this particular sort of Kung Fu &#x96; being drunk and unbeatable at the same time. He saves his dad from being killed at the end. It is a typical story that all Chinese loves - naughty boy turn out to be a good man. Confucian tenet is still part of the guideline for these older films &#x96; respect the seniors and be a good man. Many of us have heard of this particular Kung Fu style a lot but never actually seen it. Jackie Chan has provided us a full demonstration of it with style. The film maker also captures how hard Jackie Chan was made to practice again and again on the same basics techniques. It was overwhelming to watch. It is similar to a scene in Farewell, My concubine &#x96; Kids are made to practice on basics, otherwise they will get punished for their laziness. There are lots of Chinese movie showing this traditional belief &#x96; the harder you practice, the more you get from it. No doubt Jackie Chan was young and had been trained; still, doing pushups with the wrists turning up and down at the same time as the legs up the air are not easy. I just cannot bear to think how much damage it causes to the hands for the sake of the film. The director, Yuen Woo-ping, has been actively involved in Hollywood blockbusters in recent years, for example, The Matrix series (1999-2003), Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon (2000) and the Kill Bill volumes (2003-2004). This film is his second film as a director. It is also a corner stone, establishing his career as an action movie director in the Hong Kong filming industry. He was a martial arts choreographer turned director. Hence he was keen to prove his knowledge of different and difficult Kung Fu styles to the audience. Unlike Bruce Lee's films, his film doesn't involve much political elements. So it is easy to watch. I personally think his way of shooting this film is rather raw, more like jumping one chapter to another without much connection. The screen resolution of the movie was low and the colour quality was dull back in 1978. Generally the acting is stiff, and the conversions are predictable except his martial art performance is spotless from my personal point of view. Comparing this earlier film with the films he did in recent years, there is a lot more Kung Fu and less talking in these earlier films. This film is also known as a low budget film. Not much had been invested on sets, makeup or costumes; its success comes from the witty dialogue and plenty of Kung Fu.

Fei-hung tries to get away from this fate but it is not long till his drunken teacher tracks him down and teaches him, whether he likes it or not. However, when he is humbled by the mighty killer Thunderleg, he decides to train to be better no matter what it takes.I've not given up on modern releases totally but a real death-march of uninspiring films of late has seen me using my DVD rental subscription to get in touch with older films and also genres that do not often show up on my basic TV package. Recently this has seen me getting some old-school martial arts films and of course Drunken Master had to be one of the first to be seen. When watching it, it is important that you keep your genre frame of reference because as a film (with no riders or expectations) it could be dismissed as having no substance to speak of - an accusation that I myself level at many blockbusters that offer me nothing to engage with. In this case though one does have to wonder if it matters because in terms of pure entertainment value there is just about sufficient story to pull a basic frame together for an amusing and exciting film.I say this because the plot doesn't do much other than set up the many fight sequences that the film has and really these are the reason why we are all here. Without exception, these are technically and visually impressive. The physical strength and control of the actors is just as impressive as the choreography and, unlike modern films, the camera sits back so we can see and doesn't get into the close and frantic editing which reveal the actor perhaps could only do one short movement at a time and needed lots of help from the camera. Speaking of camera movement, one of the joys of the film is to see what has now become the genre-defining zooms in on faces and other such clichés.Speaking of which, the acting also fits this mould as it is the wonderful OTT style of acting, with big hair and exaggerated performances that owe a debt to silent cinema. Chan is not at his funniest here (partly because his character necessitates a degree of arrogance that takes away a little) but he is still very comic and self-effacing in his comedy. He is well supported by Yuen, who is also very skilled and able to do comedy, while Hwang's villain is wonderfully 1970's martial arts and full of camp menace. The support cast features some familiar faces who bring stuff to the table such as the high-kicking Linda Lin and the amusing Dean Shek.Drunken Master is very much a genre film and those who do not like the conventions of the genre should not be too shocked to find that they don't like it here. However for martial arts fans and the casual viewer, this is a great film with plenty of brilliant action blended with a genial and comic tone that allows it to be solid good fun.

But even for his movie, this one somehow is a notch funnier because the timing is so quick and action so raw. Back in the '70s people made no apologies about beating scoundrels up, and this strait forwardness in beating the opponent adds extra humor to the action.This was before Jacky Chan had a family, and 24 year young Jack Chan's moves although not as refined as his later movies, have edge that's refreshing to watch. For the first of its kind, this movie is so well made, and it still stands as one of the best kung-fu action comedy.If you've missed seeing this movie, you really owe it to yourself to see it at least once.History of Hong Kong cinema being made right in front of your eyes, that started the fantastic entertainment industry that is Jacky Chan and his movies, spanning the next 30 years and still counting.

The comedy is unbearably stupid at times, the dialogue is hokey and the sound effects are too silly for a live-action film. The fight scenes seem too rehearsed, too choreographed; they look less like real fights than like shows that have been carefully set up to demonstrate the various kung-fu techniques. Nevertheless, it is a fine showcase for the skills (comedic and otherwise) of Jackie Chan, and he remains funny and likable throughout.

Drunken Master (Zui quan) may be considered as one of these very good movies.

Was it worth it? Well, yeah it was, but at the same time it wasn't all that I had expected.The story was fun and well-thought through, about Wong Fei-Hung who is a rascal, dishonoring his father who is a Kung Fu master. As a punishment he is to train with his uncle who is said to be ruthless and mean. The young Fei-Hung is in for some rough training, but eventually comes to see the meaning of the tough training.Drunken Master is more of a comedy (or Comedy Fu, if you will) than it is an actual Kung Fu movie. There is a lot of slapstick comedy in this movie, as is to be expected from a Chan movie. But it also shows off the grace, dexterity and skills of Jackie Chan quite well. However, for the Kung Fu, well it was fun to watch, lots of great movies and funny situations, but wow it was so horribly staged that it was painful to watch at times. It just lacked that natural flow to it, to make it seem realistic and natural. I am not saying that it wasn't enjoyable, far from it, just don't expect it to be all that and a bucket of chicken, because it was really staged from start till end.This Jackie Chan movie is a definite must have in any DVD collection of any Jackie Chan fan, just don't do the mistake that I did that compare this movie with the movies from the last two decades.I got a Sony DVD release of the movie from Amazon, and despite playing the original Cantonese language track, it kept changing between Cantonese and some seriously doubtful English dubbing. The dubbing was so bad it was beyond belief, they were even doing racial, stereotypical slur at the dubbing - it was just horrible. Luckily the DVD was in Cantonese most of the time, but when it changed to English dub (by its own will) it was just painful to listen to. These movies are meant to be watched with the original language track. English dubbing always has, and always will, be a horrible experience.And the ending of the movie, well I was stunned at that. It just ended immediately after the final showdown. It was the most abrupt and sudden ending to any movie that I have ever witnessed.

There is a lot of comedy in Chan's film and that, together with the good acting by the cast made a great beginning of the film.

After that the film just never got back on his feet and even some of the supposedly funny scenes and comments made a somewhat cheesy impression on me.

To truly enjoy this film, you should purchase the DVD-version. The only flaw comes during the dubbing between the English and Chinese/Cantonese. For me, I much prefer watching films like these in its original language, but even if you set up for Catonese, some of the scenes are still in English. Doesn't matter, it sure won't kill the fun of Drunken Master. Besides all the kung-fu action going on, Drunken Master is simply hilarious with Chan showing that he is a talented actor, both stunt coordinated and comedic. Never mind his horrible US films such as The Tuxedo and Rush Hour 2, Drunken Master is Jackie Chan's best performance ever.And you know what? Drunken Master has a pretty damn strong supporting cast as well. Yuen Hsiao Tien is absolutely wonderful playing So Hi, or known as Sam Seed in the English version. His ragged persona helps bring character to his drunken kung-fu style. There's also great and funny characters such as Bullet Head, Mr. Stick, and Gorilla who happen to play as Fei-Hong's nemesis.I must admit, Drunken Master lives up to be one of the movies that deserves classic status. You have to understand that this movie is part of the Hong Kong film industry which focuses on kung-fu movies. But to me, Drunken Master is way much more than a kung-fu flick. It's unfortunate that this film isn't a cult hit because it easily could have made a following. It's rare to see a film such as Drunken Master to have an emphasis on both martial arts and comedy. Bruce Lee would be turning in his grave if he witnessed Drunken Master, but amazingly, that's what the highlight of the movie is. Don't let this one pass you by, this is a title you would want to keep for a long time.

Snake in the Eagle's Shadow (1978) by the same people was also a huge hit and popular and gave signs of the forthcoming Chan phenomenon. There's hardly any plot in Drunken Master, but Jackie plays the hero Wong Fei-Hong, a wild and young boy whose father sends him away from home to the torturous training of Beggar Su/Sam Seed, played again by Siu Tien Yuen, the father of director Woo Ping. He played the same role of the sympathetic old man also in Snake in the Eagle's Shadow. Jackie soon learns the drunken kung fu style, a unique fighting technique, which he eventually uses against those who are planning to kill his father. To be honest, the plot isn't necessary in this film, it is even more unnecessary than in Snake.The fight choreography and techniques are great to say the least, and those this film definitely delivers! There's hardly any boring moments and there's always something going on. The training sequences are painful looking but also look effective and thus understandable in order to learn the martial art. The fights are very imaginative and funny, and what makes this film even more enjoyable is that it is genuinely funny in most cases and made me laugh or smile, which isn't always the case with Hong Kong comedies. The humor works, but I think the jokes involving eating and/or puking aren't really funny but tasteless and unnecessary, as well as those stupid face expressions of Jackie's and some others' as they just try to make the film more entertaining and lighter, which I don't think is necessary, because they are too EASY ways and surely appeal to the audience which doesn't really like any more challenging cinema or something more serious.Drunken Master is not as serious or impressive as Tsui Hark's Wong Fei Hong films Once Upon a Time in China (starring Jet Li), but still I like Drunken Master very much due to the fact that it is funny for most of the time and irritating just occasionally. This film hasn't got many things to say and depict like Tsui's films, for instance, but rarely these comic kung fu films do. They have marvellous martial art fights and choreographies, and on this level, Drunken Master isn't an exception.8/10 "},{"Title":"One of the best ever!","Date":"5 February 2001","Score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Comedy","Review":"  Generally, I don't think of martial arts films as being spectacular entertainment for everyone.

Blame Drunken Master. Yes, it's a continuation of the direction the genre was heading--the identically casted Snake in the Eagle's Shadow was basically the prototype to this movie--but this one takes that formula to such kinetic, physically generous and poetic levels that it has to mark the middle of that U-turn from chivalry to scrappy underdog stuff. It's the little things that make it work Yuen Woo-ping's sudden fearlessness about injuring his actors. The film's embrace of nature, capturing vast coves and dragonflies buzzing about during fights. The three-dimensional love-hate relationships between Jackie and his father & master. Tasteful music selection, ranging from traditional Chinese stuff (not the faux-ethnic Panda Express kind!) to a sort of cool, understated funk, to a tastefully ominous orchestral motif accompanying drunken boxing shapes that invoke gods. Also, the directing is surprisingly experimental for this sorta thing note spacial gags like when Jackie secretly uses a bench in horse stance, and the camera sees it instead of the characters due to its position. Also, that part where the image of Hwang Jang Lee reflects off the surface of a closeup of Jackie's eye (!!!) while delivering a flurry of misdirecting hand movements. While some of the physical comedy surprisingly hits its mark, it can admittedly get rather painful, but it's sort of a matter of degrees with old kung-fu movies; it's never really obtrusive here, which counts a lot.While the 90s sequel Drunken Master II (known in the US as Legend of Drunken Master) has a more iconic, distinctly aged Jackie pushing himself even further physically, it's disastrously plotted and lacks the bustling energy & pure archetypal oldschool vibe of this one. I'd say it shows Golden Harvest on their last leg creatively speaking, but no one seems to notice because IT HAS JAKKY CHEN. Anyway. The more I see this one, the fewer peers I realize it has.

He stars as the legendary Wong Fei-hung in this outstanding example of a kung fu comedy, which would later become Chan's unique trademark. It is was his best film to date. Wong is an undisciplined, mischievous young man that is sent to learn maturity and discipline in the form of a special variety of the martial arts. His teacher is an old master Yuen Siu Tin, the director's father. The training and discipline sequences are simultaneously grueling and comic. Director Yuen Woo Ping expertly blends the fight sequences with the comedy in a manner, which had previously not been seen. For example, note the scene where Jackie does the sit-ups suspended upside down, while having to fill a bucket with water using sake cups! It's very impressive physically as well as being funny. The fight choreography is outstanding from Yuen Ho Ping and Hsu Hsia, who both are in the film as well. In particular, the Eight Drunk styles of fighting training sequence and the final fight with Huang Cheng-Li as Thunderfoot are highlights. However, the acting is mostly below average, as usual in kung fu films. The dialog isn't very good either at times. There is no real plot development to speak of, just an endless barrage of fantastic fight sequences. What is unique is the execution of the formula in conjunction with comedy a strong indicator of what was to come in Chan's career. This film also marked the end of Jackie's association with legendary hack director Lo Wei. He was on loan to Seasonal Films for this production and the film became a huge box office success. **1/2 of 4 stars.

The movie has very little plot relying instead on Jackie Chan's low-brow, Three Stooges-esquire comedic timing, and his acrobatic ability.It begins with an action scene and really doesn't let up until the very end of the film. The plot concerns a feckless kung fu student (Chan) whose father forces him to study the fighting style of the Eight Drunken Gods. Of course, this means that Jackie fights his many opponents acting as if he is drunk. His physical comedy is impressive, such as his drunken stagger, his slapstick demeanor, and his acrobatic artistry is breathtaking. Chan was raised in the Peking opera, where he learned acrobatics and dancing in addition to the martial arts. This gives his fighting style a unique fluidity, as he tumbles, falls, and leaps out of the way of opponent's blows rather than confronting them head on, fist-to-fist. Most of the movie is really just him using his acrobatics to escape from superior enemies rather than actually fighting them. As impressive physically as this is, few fights actually seem to have any resolution, meaning that the fights do little to advance the narrative, functioning similarly to Busby Berkeley show-stoppers in his 1930 musicals. Most of Chan's comedy is low humor, involving bodily functions, vomiting, hitting other people a la the Three Stooges, drunkenness, and harassing the opposite sex. The action scenes become monumentally repetitive, having a mind-numbing effect on the viewer by the time you reach the end of the movie. The acting is distorted and exaggerated for comedic effect, but becomes shamelessly boring when combined with the redundant action scenes. The only reason why I give this movie a 5 is for Chan's acrobatic ability. Really, that is the only thing going for this movie, since Yuen Wo-Ping doesn't concentrate at all on mastering the film's formal qualities. The editing is choppy with poor coverage of the individual scenes. Clearly all the fight scenes were edited in camera, so the emphasis is more on the choreography of the fights rather than the filming of them, making them seem rather static and lifeless actually. The movie fails in its formal, textual qualities, so its only draw is Jackie Chan's childish humor and acrobatics. "}]
