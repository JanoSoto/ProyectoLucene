[{"Title":"A great horror thriller in the style of Eric Red","Date":"29 May 2002","Score":"57 out of 75 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Thriller","Review":"  Dead Calm is directed by Australian film maker Philip Noyce (Patriot Games, Clear and Present Danger) and he is very talented director. This film stars young Nicole Kidman (21-22 years old in this film!) as a wife to Sam Neill and they have lost their son in a horrible car accident. They want to get over it and so they go to the sea with their boat and spend several weeks there. All is going fine and they are going to get over the loss of their son, but soon they discover an abandoned looking ship in the horizon and a man (Billy Zane) paddling desperately towards them. The man reaches the ship and the couple helps him on the board. He is little confusing and suspicious and soon his real nature is revealed...This is extremely pleasant thriller and reminds me of films written by Eric Red (The Hitcher, Near Dark, Blue Steel) and these four films are very similar. The atmosphere in Dead Calm is very haunting and incredibly restrained. The atmosphere is also very similar to David Lynch and Lost Highway and Twin Peaks. The music is very important element in Dead Calm (as is in The Hitcher and Near Dark, too) and the overall feeling is very threatening and ominous. There are many exciting and breath taking scenes such as the one in which Sam Neill is trapped in a boat that is sinking and filling with water. With music, the photography is great and there are definitely no technical flaws in this great and surprisingly effective flick.The young Nicole Kidman is so talented and acts perfectly. No one can say she can't act. Just look at her face and expressions she is the main character in here and she is almost in every scene and she does nothing wrong or never acts over the top. The other actor's are also great, Sam Neill and Bill Zane, even though Zane goes little too far in couple of scenes and is not too believable. But overall, because there are so many great elements here, these little flaws and illogical plot turns can be forgiven.Philip Noyce is worth watching director and he has done also other effective thrillers, but I think this will be one of his greatest achievements. Dead Calm is highly recommended.8/10 "},{"Title":"A Full-Blooded Thriller","Date":"21 December 1998","Score":"37 out of 50 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Thriller","Review":"  This great suspense, thriller will have you gripping your seat in every scene.

Nicole Kidman is faced with recovering from the loss of her child; shown, in the start of the film, being thrown out of the front of a car windshield. There, in the dead calm of an open sea, she must resurrect her abilities of courage and strength.

They are having fun sailing through the ocean when they come to a sinking schooner with a man paddling frantically towards their boat in a lifeboat.

They are in the fight of their life.Nicole Kidman is both beautiful and talented. She doesn't say much in the movie, but her expressions and actions are well portrayed. Billy Zane is a convincing psychopath and Sam Neill is a good actor also. The cinematography is great and the scenery is really beautiful. The only real problem with the movie is the plot.The movie's conflict could've easily been resolved had it not been for stupid mistakes. The script relies too heavily on these stupid mistakes. Nicole's character gets numerous chances to kill the psychopath, but she never takes them. And anyone in their right mind wouldn't leave their wife with a stranger to check out a strange ship. The characters' lack of common sense is really what keeps the story moving.But, these plot holes can be forgiven. The acting is great, the direction is great, the cinematography is great.

I was always on the edge of my seat, anxious to know what would happen next and terrified for the characters in their respective situations, but there was much less violence than I was expecting. And I'm not complaining. Most of the violence is implied rather than shown, and the movie not only deals with physical abuse but emotional and mental abuse as well. The story is basically that this couple goes out to sea on a getaway to forget about a recent tragedy, and while they're out in the middle of the ocean they encounter a strange boat and a strange man who claims that his crew was killed by food poisoning. The way the pieces come together is very satisfying, especially when the truth slowly reveals itself and both the husband and wife are going through equally scary dilemmas as this stranger is roaming freely around their boat.The acting is really what sells this movie. A boat movie with only three characters can get boring quickly, but thanks to the cast, I was totally in it. Sam Neil is separated from the others for a good amount of the film, but when he needs to shine, he does. The anchors of this movie are Nicole Kidman and Billy Zane. Kidman is excellent as the emotionally distraught wife who is doing everything she can to keep it together while desperately trying outsmart the stranger. Billy Zane had me worried for a bit - I could tell he was acting, and at times he was a bit cartoonish, but by the end you come to realize that the character is an absolute nutcase so his erratic acting makes sense. You're not sure if he's just a guy who had a rough week, or a sympathetic victim of circumstance, or a straight up maniacal psychopath. This uncertainty helps keep the thriller afloat (yeah) and keeps you anxious to see whatever happens next.The only real complaint I have about Dead Calm is that it does get a little slow at times. It's very atmospheric and moody for a majority of the film and there's no problem with that, but I couldn't help but be distracted during some of the longer quiet moments. Regardless, it all builds up to the movie's exciting climax which doesn't disappoint. The music is great as well - haunting and subtle. Keep in mind Dead Calm is not a jump-scare type of horror thriller. It's slow-paced, grounded and completely plausible, which for me is the scariest kind.

You won't be disappointed.OK. Now, the start of the review. I just watched this film for the first time last night and I was truly blow-away. I expected just another generic thriller, but I was thankfully very wrong.This film has everything working in it's favor and working together. The directing is very good. Each shot serves it's particular purpose and does not draw too much stylistic attention to itself. The script was very well-structured and develops each of the 3 main characters just enough before the film kicks into high gear. And when the action/thrills start, they don't stop. The film has an excellent pace and never drags on at any point like most films do in general.One thing that deserves special attention is the use of sound and music. The beginning is literally a dead calm. Not much music at all, just ambient sounds that ratchet up the tension little by little. The cinematography is also very clean and colorful. Doesn't look dated at all, except for a few scenes in the very beginning of the movie. But once the story moves onto the boat(s), it looks like it was filmed yesterday.One thing that I liked about this film is, like all great thrillers...just when you think it can't get any worse, it does. It gets much worse.But of course this film has it's share of minor questionable actions, particularly by Sam Neill's character, who gets stranded on a sinking ship. Instead of wasting time trying to pump the water out of the room he's trapped inside, why not just break through the weak bottom like he ends up doing anyway? Oh well, I can forgive that. A character in a life and death situation like that probably won't be thinking as clearly as someone who is sitting in the comfortable safety of their living room, so it's easy to forget about.I almost was going to complain about the friday the 13th ending (see Fatal Attraction), but when I saw how the situation was dealt with, I instantly forgave them. Very shocking way of disposing of a character if I do say so myself.I highly recommend this film for all thriller fans. This is one of the most suspenseful movies I have seen in a very long time. It's a shame that they don't make them like this any more.

It stars Sam Neill, Nicole Kidman and Billy Zane. Music is by Graeme Revell and cinematography by Dean Semler.After losing their young son in a car accident, John (Neill) and Rae Ingram (Kidman) head out alone on their yacht for an ocean vacation. Whilst taking in some R&R, the couple spy a ship drifting in the distance, then a man in a dinghy hurriedly rows towards them. He boards their yacht, frantic and panicked, he tells them the ship is sinking and that all on board are dead, killed by food poisoning. His name is Hughie Warriner (Billy Zane), and the Ingram's are about to wish they had never met him...The Saracen and The Orpheus.It's so refreshing to find a thriller that works without tricks or elaborate plotting, where the narrative is stripped down to the bare bones and played out purely by three characters. Dead Calm, whilst not exactly the most credible of thrillers from the 80s, contains genuine suspense, a pot boiling heart and production value of some distinction. Director Noyce deals in psychological studies, primarily that of a lunatic and that of a woman beset with grief having to use her mental fortitude to hopefully save herself and her husband.Noyce and his team get the maximum amount of edge of the seat thrills from a small isolated yacht in the middle of a vast ocean, with tight camera work and nifty editing, it's a film of quality that belies its pared back production. Even ace Aussie photographer Semler (previously Mad Max 2/Razorback, latterly Dances With Wolves/Waterworld) creates beauty out of such a sparse set up, where the blues and greens of the ocean warm the soul and the red sunsets please the eyes. They be glimpses of Mother Earth that give the Ingram's something tangible to fight for.With the plot requiring Neill to be in his own isolated hell, he turns in a more measured performance, perfect in fact, but it's Zane and Kidman who steal the show. This would prove to be the launching point of Kidman's career, and it hints at the top actress she would become. She gives Rae Ingram a real strength through adversity, with energy in abundance, intelligence and a simmering sexuality, she's a lady character earning respect by film lovers because of Kidman's performance. Zane is suitably edgy, very much giving Hughie a man-child persona, he too exudes a dangerous sexuality, and when it inevitably kicks off, he is scary into the bargain.A couple of daft character decisions within the story, and a WTF finale, stop it from being near the top of the thriller movie pantheon. But it's not far off from sitting with the best and it remains fresh and entertaining as the decades roll by. 8/10 "},{"Title":"An exceptional thriller that will stand the test of time.","Date":"12 March 2007","Score":"10 out of 14 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Thriller","Review":" Dead calm is an 'edge of your seat' thriller with above-average acting from Kidman, Neil and Zane.

It's well paced and constructed (except for the tacked on ending), beautifully shot, and extremely lean and economical. There is a ton of tension and dread to be found in all the usual places, of course, but the director also does a great job of building atmosphere and adding telling details that give the film that extra wallop. To me, the mark of the director and screenwriter's real intelligence and plotting savvy can be found when Neill's character is playing the recorded events on the VCR of the sinking boat. It's a brilliant plot device - it lets us know, without exposition or wasted time exactly what happened previously, while simultaneously building a sense of dread, paranoia, claustrophobia, and madness that prefigures an awful fate for his wife in the present. That's really good film making, IMO. I've never been Kidman's biggest fan (though I admit she has done good work in many films); it's not that she isn't good, it's just that she's overrated (ie, at least a dozen other actresses could have done just as well in films like Moulin Rouge and The Others) . But I liked her a lot in Dead Calm; she essentially carried the film - with able assists from Sam Neill and Billy Zane - quite an accomplishment for any young actress. The only real beef I have with the film is the weak ending, which was obviously tacked on to meet audience expectations of how a terror flick is supposed to end. But in spite of its technical excellence, Dead Calm is a very conventional, conservative suspense film - it plays with the rules extremely well, but it doesn't break or extend the boundaries of the genre, so my feeling is that I can live with the ending if that's what it took for the film to make some money.

It is one of those films like Deliverance (1972) that make you never want to go on a boating trip again. Dead Calm works as a great suspense film in many of the same ways as Alien (1979) did, and many comparisons can be drawn. Dead Calm's tag-line is In the middle of nowhere there is nowhere to hide. Alien's tag-line is In space, no one can hear you scream. The feeling of isolation and helplessness in the vast open ocean, or outer space in Alien, adds to the terror of this film. Also like Alien, Dead Calm is a story about an uninvited guest that wreaks havoc on a cramped ship. On the boat there is a limited amount of space, so there is an element of claustrophobia. Dead Calm is also similar to Alien because the film is centered mainly around a strong and oppressed female character. Sigourney Weaver relied upon her wits and courage to survive, similar to Kidman's role in this film. Also like Alien, Dead Calm features a lot of silence which adds to the drama, reality and tension.All things considered, Dead Calm is truly a well made and entertaining suspense film. The performances by the then unknown Sam Neill, Nichole Kidman and Billy Zane, are quite impressive. Billy Zane's performance as Hughie Warriner, the charming yet psychotic stowaway, is the best of his career. The direction by Phillip Noyce is quite impressive also. Dead Calm features perhaps some of the best photography on the high seas. The musical score featuring a primal, exhausted and guttural breathing sound is quite chilling and is used very effectively. Though I have made comparisons to Alien, Dead Calm is original and stands well on its own. There is nothing 'Calm' about Dead Calm, it is truly a great suspense film. The story never drags, there is plenty of mystery and heart pounding action. Highly recommended.

This year seems to have seen an enormous increase in the number of films that I like being seen. Perhaps I'm being softer on films in the New Year or maybe I'm getting better at sorting out the dross from the candy-floss as time goes on. Some films you know are going to be better than others - either because you've seen them before or they have a reputation about them. Dead Calm is one of the latter, a traditional thriller in every sense but with only three characters. They don't write them like this any more.If any couple could do with a break then it's the Ingrams. John (Sam Neill) is a naval officer who returns from a tour of duty to find that his wife is in hospital after an apparent suicide attempt. Rae (a young Nicole Kidman) is still distraught at the death of their son so John proposes a quiet trip on their private yacht. After a while sunning themselves in calm blue waters, they come across an apparently sinking ship and a lone survivor, Hughie (Billy Zane). After rescuing Hughie, they take him on board but the castaway is far and above their worst fears, confirmed when John is stranded on the sinking ship and Rae is stuck on the yacht with Hughie who, it is fair to say, has bad intentions on his mind.Dead Calm is a superbly written film, simple and effective at gripping the viewer and ratcheting the tension towards the end. All three actors are superb - Zane has never been better than here - but Kidman shows her potential here in arguably her breakthrough role. Neill is dependable, as always, a fine actor giving a solid performance although I felt he was an odd choice for an action hero. Together with the yacht and the dog, there really is nothing else to distract you from the story and this is why it works - because there is absolutely no escape from the terrible situation these people are in.I do have one or two niggles, though. Firstly, the ending was weak and predictable and left me with a strange sense of disappointment, even though I had enjoyed the film. Also, the interaction between Hughie and Rae get increasingly unlikely as the film goes on. Rae's character undergoes a quite staggering transformation from an emotionally-drained grieving mother to a hard-nosed bitch with a harpoon. Not to mention the fact that she can pilot the boat just as well as Neill's naval officer. It all felt a little too convenient for me but like I said, this shouldn't detract from what is a great thriller, gripping you from the off and refusing to let go until the last second. Cracking tale, wonderful acting and strangely beautiful scenery (it's the sea but Hell, it's bluer than what we get here) all combine to make one masterful movie with tension as tight as a main sail.

The opening one, about Nicole Kidman's and Sam Neil's loss of their son, could have easily been explained with dialogue - or not, since it never really comes back up again and only serves to slightly inform the audience of their emotional state. It compromises the rest of the film, though, which is set at sea. Kidman and Neil are on a long sailing trip when they come upon a stalled yacht. Before they even have much of a thought about it, a young man (Billy Zane) rows over to their boat as quick as his muscles will guide him. He claims that everyone else on the boat died of food poisoning and that it's now sinking, but Neil doesn't buy it. When Zane falls asleep, he rows over there himself and finds that everyone else has been murdered. Zane wakes up while Neil is gone and commandeers his own boat - and kidnaps his wife. Neil, an experienced sailor, fixes the other yacht and chases after them. Man, this is tense stuff, and all three of the actors are brilliant. It's too bad about that final sequence, which harms the movie far more than the unnecessary opening sequence.

There is a purity in Noyce's economical approach that makes everything seem so real; even the use of music is sparing, the haunting score reserved for key scenes where it is at its most effective.Dead Calm also benefits from a superb cast. It's not often one can say that everyone in a film is superb, but it is most definitely the case here. Admittedly, there are only three characters to speak of, but Kidman, Neill and Zane are perfect in their respective roles Zane, a most under-rated actor in my opinion, is utterly convincing as a deranged lunatic; the always excellent Neill adds yet another great performance to his résumé; and the fresh-faced and very sexy Kidman gives a memorable and credible turn as a fragile woman forced to find an inner strength if she and her husband are to survive their ordeal.Although this film isn't quite a 'Perfect 10' (to borrow a phrase from Sea Trial, which I highly recommend, BTW) thanks to a rather silly ending that feels at odds with the rest of the film, it is a solid 9 &#x97; a rating that I'll happily bump up to a 10 anyway for getting the lovely Kidman in the altogether for a steamy sex scene.

Rae (a young Nicole Kidman) suffers a horrific car accident that kills her son. To recover from this incident she boards a yacht with her husband (played by a much older Sam Neil) and goes sailing on the Pacific. The tension builds when they pick up Hughie (a young Billy Zane). All in all, this is a good ocean suspense thriller. Zane delivers an emotional performance as the villain. His last appearance on the boat at the very end is pure classic.  Kidman is great and very beautiful. In fact I almost didn't recognize her. This film substitutes the traditional car chase with a yacht chase too. However, it lacks a variety of scenes which makes it quite repetitive at some points. The bulk of the movie takes places on the yacht and as the title would suggest we go from the calming and soothing ocean to mounting tension and vice versa. Worth watching though.

First Dead Calm, then Titanic. Every time this guy gets out on water, he turns into Mr. Hyde. Somebody keep this guy on dry land! Maybe on dry land he'll behave himself and won't annoy nice people like John and Rae Ingram (Sam Neill and Nicole Kidman). What did they ever do to him? They're a couple who are off on a lengthy sea cruise to try to overcome a recent tragedy, the loss of their toddler son in a car crash.So, there they are, somewhere -- nowhere -- in the vast Pacific. In ..... dead calm. Suddenly! -- along comes a spider that sits down beside her ..... I mean, along comes Hughie -- what a name for a bad guy ... Hughie! -- who is escaping, alone, from his (allegedly) sinking nearby schooner. John decides that Hughie might not be quite right -- duh! -- and sneaks away to investigate the mysterious schooner. When Hughie discovers this, he takes control of the Sloop John B and he and Rae are off to the races for multiple rounds of blood-curdling fun. Poor John, meanwhile, is left behind aboard the schooner, there to do battle with the nasty demons that Hughie left behind.For all intensive porpoises, Dead Calm is a three-character thriller played out almost entirely on the water. And more than a little of it even IN the water. Besides Billy turning into a waterwolf every time he gets out on the choppy brine, Sam Neill himself has had his own problems on H2O mit NaCl. Besides Dead Calm, consider Sam's roles in the problematic-water movies The Hunt for Red October, The Rainbow Warrior and the recent TV movie Submerged. Maybe he should consider sticking to dry land, too. Such as in the classic 1983 mini-series (about a 10-parter, as I recall) Reilly Ace of Spies, which I loved.And then there's Nicole Kidman. EVEN SHE has bad luck with water. In an effort to recover from her horrifying encounter with Hughie in Dead Calm, she decided to go on a 10-year Cruise, which ALSO came to a bad end. Oh, the woe.Some people, applying that ridiculous concept known as logic, question why Rae did not do away with Hughie at her first opportunity once he'd taken her for a ride on the thrill-a-chill-with-Bill wheel. What would have been the point of that? Had she done so, what would we have then had? About a 30-minute short! And 30 minutes does not a movie make. Rather, director Phillip Noyce had to give her at least 10 such opportunities in order to fill up a good 90 minutes, at which point he could then bring on the dénouement.So, here's the deal. If any of you are planning a future cruise, before actually boarding the vessel, I recommend that you take a close look at all boarding passengers. If any one of them looks suspiciously like Billy Zane, then I STRONGLY suggest a quick change in travel plans. You know. Just to be on the safe side. Why tempt fate? As my elderly uncle always reminded me, it is better to watch a movie than to actually BE IN a movie. To which I would add, ESPECIALLY if it's a movie with Billy Zane in it and if the word water is mentioned but once in the script!

I don't even plan a cruise on a huge liner, much-less on a yacht. During unexpected situations, oceans and seas (even lakes) don't give you any place to run. Yet, I AM attracted to sea-stories - younger people should take a look at Lifeboat, with Tallulah Bankhead. Because the whole film is shot in the lifeboat, character-development is its plot.Dead Calm develops its characters - except for Billy Zane (Hughie Warriner) very quickly. I liked that it didn't take-up half the picture before the story began. Terry Haryes (screenwriter) quickly defines how a fragilely weepy woman becomes a fighter, when it is necessary. There isn't a handbook that lists just what to do, and such desperate situations quickly confuse almost anyone on action to take.Director Phillips Noyce (never heard of him) certainly produced a carefully thought-out plot. I found fault with none of it, except I agree John Ingram (Sam Neil) set-out for The Orpheum just a tad hastily, leaving his wife with a nutty-acting guy - I'd have thrown him back and sailed out of there. But, we need silly action to give the story more frightening scenes. Although John's actions on The Orpheum were thrilling and seemed to be what an experienced sailor would do, I'd have gotten right back in my dinghy and left that ship. I also wondered what happened to the lifeboat seen trailing the ship. after he gets it to sailing. Why build a raft ? Again, after a harrowing attempt to get off the ship would cause almost anyone not to think rationally.Nicole Kidman (Rae Ingram) played her role skillfully. The cinematography was gorgeous and grotesque. Although Neil was stellar in his role, Zane stole the picture. Bravo! I liked every scene in Dead Calm - I own the DVD and watch it often - even liked the tacked-on ending that so many thought was unnecessary. I recommend it to any audience - I get so caught-up in the story, I don't try to make any reasonable explanations for its few weaknesses. It's a 10-er....

I mean, it's one of the most stupid things I've seen in a loooong time, it makes no sense at all. Let's start from the beginning why was the introductive event of the car accident and the child's death necessary? I mean, what logical basis does it give to the rest of the plot? The reason why the couple goes off to sea on the boat, to forget the past and relax? What the hell, is a son's death the only reason why a married couple would go for a boat trip on the ocean, and without it would there be no way to develop such a story? Let's go on basically, everything goes unexplained. Who is the bad guy? What happened on his boat? What does he want from the couple? We don't know, we can only guess, no explanation is given. From the very moment he steps on the boat, the couple seems to throw their brains into the deep blue sea, and not one single logical action takes place from their side.Man goes off to sea with a small boat to climb into a sinking ship, wife gets kidnapped and their boat taken away. Of course. The guy struggles with death on the sinking ship with the expressiveness and the emotional communication of a grouper fish swimming in its sea spot in its everyday boring grouper fish life, the bad guy keeps stalking the woman, rapes her (and she doesn't even seem to dislike it that much), tries to kill her, with her knowing that there is a goddamn rifle lying in a drawer, which she never thinks about taking to defend herself. When she finally manages to, she just falls into the bad guy's arms handing the rifle to him. She throws the boat key into the sea and her stupid dog fetches it back. Finally she seems to prevail over the bad guy, leaves him off to sea on an inflatable boat, rejoins with her husband, and you can just see them nice and clean talking about what they would like to have for breakfast, like everything - both of them risking their lives, she being raped, their boat being ruined and so on - never happened. But of course, like even my 4-years-old nephew could predict, the bad guy just gets out of nowhere again and attacks her. And here we have the grand finale husband gets signal rocket, points it towards the bad guy's head while he is struggling with his wife behind a goddamn sail, you can only see their silhouettes projected on it, moving frantically, and guess what? He hits the target at first shot, darting the rocket through the sail exactly into the bad guy's mouth, about 30 cm from his wife's head. Superman is nothing by comparison, man.Really stay away from this unbearable piece of crap.

The two main characters are sensible and intelligent people who just happen to be at the wrong place at the wrong time. Like with every thriller their are a few minor loopholes, but overall the situations are done in a believable fashion with no extreme jumps in logic. The script is tight and the suspense consistent. The action comes naturally through the scenarios and is not forced or played out too long. Having it take place at sea gives it a very distinct flavor. The limitations of the setting actually makes it even more creative. It also hits on one of the main ingredients of fear which is isolation.The only minor liability is the Zane character. At times he seems like a very believable and even fascinating psychotic. He is definitely no machine like slasher. There are times when he seems very calm and complacent. His disturbed traits only surface sporadically thus giving him a much more multi-faceted presence. Unfortunately he is also very careless and sometimes even amazingly dumb. This hurts the tension because it seems to be telegraphing his own demise.The Neill character makes a good counterpoint. He is savvy and no- nonsense. He takes action into his own hands and doesn't just fall into the helpless victim mode of other thrillers. The Kidman character is another refreshing change of pace. She is not the standard 'screaming lady in a bikini', but instead shows equal resourcefulness.The film does resort to the modern day slasher trend of having a 'double' ending.

While out at sea they rescue Hughie Warriner, a young man from another yacht who claims that all his crewmates have died from food poisoning. The couple's holiday turns into a nightmare when they discover that Hughie's story is untrue and that he is in fact a psychopath who has murdered his crewmates.The idea for a thriller set on board a boat in the middle of the ocean was probably borrowed from Hitchcock's Lifeboat, and Dead Calm clearly owes something to the great director's style. When John travels to Hughie's yacht, which has started to sink, Rae finds herself in a classic thriller situation, that of the woman alone in a confined space with a murderous criminal. Most films which rely upon this plot device, such as the Audrey Hepburn vehicle Wait Until Dark or the more recent Panic Room, are dark and claustrophobic in tone, but the tone of Dead Calm is precisely the opposite- light and open, with plenty of shots of a vast, empty sea and sky. Rae, however, faces the same problem as the heroines of those films- she has nowhere to run to and must therefore try and outwit her assailant.The recent British film Donkey Punch, another example of a thriller set on board a yacht, shows the influence of Dead Calm, with one particular detail being a distinct piece of plagiarism from the earlier film. Dead Calm, however, is by far the better film. With its seedy, gratuitous sex scenes, Donkey Punch is a particularly tawdry piece of film-making which declines into a game of guess which character will be the next one to be killed, and how. Unlike Oliver Blackburn, however, Phillip Noyce clearly realised that, in a thriller, tension works better than do graphic depictions of sex and gruesome violence.The three main roles are all well played, especially by a young Nicole Kidman as Rae (this was the film which first brought her to international notice)and Billy Zane as the maniacal Hughie. Zane is probably best known today for Titanic, another film about a vessel sinking in mid-ocean and in which he also played a villain. The film does suffer from one plot hole; it is never explained why John should have left his wife alone on the yacht with Hughie, even though it is quite clear that he suspects that the young man may not be telling the truth. (The answer is presumably that if John had remained on the yacht all along there would not have been much of a film). Noyce's direction, however, generates genuine tension and that one point apart this is a pretty good thriller. 7/10 "},{"Title":"It Ain't  a Pleasure Cruise","Date":"27 August 2009","Score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Thriller","Review":" You've got three actors, two old boats, a big ocean, and ninety minutes to fill. So you better have your ducks in a row, otherwise the package is going to sink faster than the proverbial lead balloon. Fortunately, the folks in charge here know what to do, and the void turns into a real nail-biter. Darn near everything but the kitchen sink is thrown into the action, and I may have even seen that float by.After a 100+ reviews, two comments might be helpful. Note that in the struggle to survive, Hughie's (Zane) main adversary is not the expected other male, John (Neill), Rae's husband. Instead, John spends his time trying to keep his head above water in that broken-down old schooner, a long way from the malevolent Hughie. No, it's up to the girl Rae (Kidman) to save the day any way she can, without the expected masculine help. Good thing, Hughie's got an eye for her fine-boned head and certain other features, otherwise she's a dead duck in the first five minutes. Thus, the real contest is a resourceful woman versus an unpredictable man that breaks with the long-established convention of combat mano y mano. And this departure, I take, to be a reflection of a surging feminist movement then making its way into popular screenplays.Another sign of the times is the anti-climax add-on. In the old studio days, killing a guy once was usually enough. Then, after the bad guy was dispatched, the audience could relax and await a return to normalcy for the good guys. However, clever modern filmmakers found they could supply a surprise extra jolt by breaking with convention and bringing the menace back from the apparent dead. That way, the audience can never feel secure enough to relax, and suspense is kept on high right up to fade-out.The price they pay, however, is moving from a semblance of reality into the realm of cartoon violence. Here, Rae hits Hughie with everything but a laser blast. So how does Hughie, who appears to be a mere mortal like the rest of us, survive to provide that extra jolt. As you might guess, only by departing from reality as the rest of us know it. Thus, the structure of the screenplay migrates from what could happen into what happens only in the movies. And, for me, at least, I'm reminded that this is, after all, only make-believe. Nonetheless, the movie really does accomplish a whole lot with a surprisingly very little.

I mean, I expected Billy Zane's character to be very psychotic and senile, not as conservative as he was, which actually turned out for the better anyway, and he was very intimidating as he was, calm and preserved, not being over-the-top aggressive and in the end unbelievable.He did a very great job in his performance, with a subtle but frightening character, as did Nicole Kidman and Sam Neill who delivered very well. Especially Nicole Kidman; This is one of her greatest early performances that I found her so enjoyable and entertaining to watch; she did a fantastic job. I thought it was very suspenseful too, like, I was expecting it to be just entertaining and great fun, not as thrilling as it was with nail-biting tension between her character and Billy Zane's; I never looked away. This movie was excellently constructed, for that matter. The only reason I didn't give it a higher rating is because it's just one of those movies I feel overall there are much better movies, such as it got a little boring and uninteresting at times, and it of course is no masterpiece, but overall just a very satisfying thriller that anyone can get enjoyment out of.It's ending was cliché and mediocre, as did the movie become a little predictable at times, but hey, the rest of the movie with it's performances and excellent build-up anticipation, and the way Billy Zane is killed *claps*, make up for it's predictable ending and minor parts of banal irk. Overall, this was a really delightful treat and I plan on seeing it again very soon because I feel I would even enjoy it a lot more a second time around. Wonderful performances, great suspense, superbly constructed and definitely worth the watch!

The young couple are out on a yacht on the coasts of Australia, enjoying their escape from everything after a horrible accident in which they lost their child. But one day, they come across another vessel, and a man named Hughie (Billy Zane) boards their yacht, claiming the entire crew of his vessel are dead and that the boat is sinking. John heads to the vessel, and ends up trapped inside as it begins to slowly sink. But Hughie isn't what he seems to be - he is in fact a serial killer, and he now has free reigns over the Ingram yacht, while Rae attempts to save John from drowning while trying to battle the psychotic murderer.I hadn't heard of Dead Calm, and happened to catch it on a movie channel one night, interested after reading the plot synopsis. From the beginning I was hooked, and knew that this was going to be a pretty good flick. It's an original story, and has the perfect set-ups for a great thriller. Suspense is present throughout, and stays consistent as the movie runs it's course. The film is never uninteresting and I was held in it's grip, which is obviously always a good thing, especially when it comes to thrillers. One admirable thing about this movie is it's characters. They're intelligent, believable, and seem like genuinely real people, and this adds to the audience's sympathy for them (well, the two main characters, at least) and gives them a certain credibility. The cinematography is nice and the entire movie really looks good (the ocean setting is really beautiful), so all in all the film was shot well.Above all things, I was really pleased with the setting of the film, and it's probably the most notable thing about this movie. The yacht-at-sea setting is a perfect place for this type of horror/thriller to unfold, mainly because this particular setting hasn't been taken advantage of much before, and it's also quite claustrophobic. Where do you run from a killer when you're in the middle of the ocean on a small vessel? There is nowhere to run, nowhere to hide - you have to face the monster, and that's what is so interesting. This premise gives plenty of way for interaction between the villain and the victim, and these scenes are quite engaging. There are a few frightening moments, but most of the film's power is in it's suspense, tension, and atmosphere, which is respectable.A younger Nicole Kidman plays Rae, the soft-spoken and likable young woman who is trapped with a psychotic murderer in the middle of the ocean. Her character is in quite the debacle, and she plays the strong-willed damsel in distress perfectly. At first I thought Billy Zane was an odd choice for a psychopathic serial killer, but, to my surprise, he works. He's not typically the kind of guy that you'd find as scary, but he knew how to turn that on in this movie, because he was quite menacing. Kidman and Zane have good chemistry together, and their interactions (between the bad guy and the heroine) are really well done. Sam Neill is strong as well as Rae's husband, although most of the screen time is given over to Kidman and Zane, but overall everyone carries the film well. Now, as for the ending, well, sure it was a little bit of a disappointment. It was clever but almost too far-fetched, but everything that led up to it (including the extremely well-done bit where Billy Zane's bloody hands are posing as Sam Neill's as he's washing Rae's hair) is just great.Overall, Dead Calm is a unique and immensely entertaining horror/thriller that is worth a watch. It's a truly different story with an excellent setting. The acting is strong, the atmosphere and scripting is all solid, and it's quite suspenseful to boot. Surely recommended to any fans of good thrillers, it's one you won't want to miss out on. The ending is a bit of a let down, but everything else was done very, very well. 8/10.

It offers plenty of tension and scares and thrills without the need for a crazy, maniacal monster. I was lucky enough to catch it on AMC a couple of days ago. I had heard of this movie but had never gotten the chance to see it. And I'm glad I did. I love films like this. You don't need a lot of blood and gore and crazy monsters or zombies to get scared. I think just normal people with mental issues make the best villains. Sam Neill and Nicole Kidman play John and Rae, a married couple who have just been in a tragic car accident that claimed the life of their only son and critically injured Rae. Once she is recovered, John and Rae decide to take a vacation on their new boat. They come across a ship in the middle of the ocean and it's only surviving passenger, Hughie Warner, played by Billy Zane, is swimming towards John and Rae's boat on a lifeboat. John and Rae pull him to safety and after Hughie explains to them what happened, John decides to go check out the ship himself. And leaves his wife Rae alone on the boat with this stranger Hughie. Once John leaves, another side of Hughie is revealed and he kidnaps Rae and steals their boat, leaving John on the other ship to fend for himself.The movie becomes highly entertaining once Hughie kidnaps Rae. I love the scenes where she thinks Hughie is knocked out or asleep and he appears unexpectedly. I love the scenes where she's trying to get away from him as he's attempting to kill her and there aren't many places to go and hide since they're on a boat! That's one of the main reasons why this movie is so exciting and thrilling. It's taking place on a boat on the middle of the ocean and there's a crazed killer on the loose! On a boat! And jumping off the boat isn't an option because you'll drown, obviously. And you most certainly don't' want to kill yourself! Billy Zane was excellent as the psychotic killer. He has those piercing eyes that make you know that he's capable of doing harm to someone and he showed up just when you think he's done away with. Certainly not a bad performance from one of his early film roles. Nicole Kidman, also in one of her early film roles, was pleasant as Rae, who was willing to do anything for or with Hughie to stay alive and save herself and her beloved husband. She was a true heroine and her character was likable. And Sam Neill is always a brilliant actor as John, who went to great lengths to find his beloved wife and make sure she's alive and well.Dead Calm had plenty of thrilling moments and it will certainly keep you on the edge of your seat. There's plenty of tension in between all the characters and fans of the genre will not be disappointed. Certainly an unknown little gem that should be viewed by any thriller fans. I'm glad I was able to see it. Thanks for reading my review!

She even goes to the extent of sacrificing her female honour to this man, all with the intention of both keeping herself alive and saving her husband. In this respect we can forgive her for this because I don't think anyone else in the same situation would possibly have acted much differently. This film has intense mood.

These include some measure of predictability that is usually inherent in the genre, and a couple of large plot holes. For example, I can't imagine an Australian naval officer having the wherewithal to own, or even rent a yacht like that. Also there was a gun on board, but it takes Rae almost half of the movie to start trying to get it, when I should think that would have been her focus from the moment Huey broke out of the cabin. She also had a large knife in her hand at one point and never tried to use it, or get to it before or after that point. Also the ending was the kind of thing everyone's seen before. But, hey, it's a movie. Now, here is what was done well. You have to hand it to all three of the main actors for their performances. Sam Neill does his character in a kind of understated, British sort of way. (Yes, I know he's a kiwi) A lot of actors would have taken this role over the top. Billy Zane was as creepy as always. He can really play a nut case. You've got to wonder about him. And Nicole Kidman. Her character finds great reserves of inner strength at a point in her life when many women might just give up, and Kidman makes it believable. Her fresh, blue-eyed beauty is a joy to watch. (Nice buns, too!) Also the photography of the vast empty ocean brings home the fact that there will be no external help, no rescue, that John and Rae must rely upon their own resourcefulness to survive.

The genre is woman in jeopardy. You've seen thousands of them and this one incorporates many of the familiar clichés.Here we have Nicole Kidman and her dog, Benjie. She and her husband, Sam Neil, are aboard their sloop in the Pacific in a dead calm. A schooner is sighted nearby and a man, Billy Zane, furiously rows a dinghy from the immobile schooner to the immobile sloop. The schooner turns out to be a rotting, evil ship, while the immaculate sloop is manned by two hopefuls and a playful dog. The evil schooner is black and the immaculate sloops is white. (I think this is called symbolism.) Zane climbs aboard the sloop, looking as if he's just swum through a vat of schmaltz, and relates this improbable tale of botulism poisoning that left everyone else dead. While he rests, Neil rows the dinghy over to investigate and finds evidence of a journey that ended in chaos and murder.Following the conventions of the genre, Zane wakes up, throws Kidman to the side, and commandeers the boat, leaving Neil aboard the filthy rotten miserable ship of doom. The man in these films must be wounded or too distant to help or, as in this case, both. Nothing Kidman does enables her to outwit or harm Zane. She tries all her wiles including seduction. No dice. That's the genre for you -- the woman in jep must be unable to find safety for herself and her child. There's no child in this movie. That's Benjie the dog's role.Three things happen that not only strain credulity but draw and quarter it. (1) A lightning bolt topples the mast on the evil boat so that it plunges head first into what is perhaps the only critical spot on the boat if you want to trap Sam Neill below decks with water rising to his chin. (2) Kidman tries to shotgun Zane but of course is foiled, so the resourceful babe puts a locked door between herself and the madman while she loads a spear gun. With Zane shrieking and banging on the other side of the door, she pops a spear through it. There is a cry of pain and a trickle of blood through the hole. The pounding stops. What does she do next? Not what YOU would do next. She cautiously opens the punctured hatch and steps through it to look into things. (3) This allows Zane's supposedly dead body to spring back to life. He does it again later. Let me be entirely clear about this -- the same dead body springs back to life two times.I guess I've made enough fun out of this. The criticism is mainly aimed at the clichés that the genre commands, not at this movie, because the movie makes perhaps the most skillful use of these formulaic incidents that a viewer can imagine. The plot misses not a single opportunity to ratchet up the tension and it all works pretty well. A lesser director and less inventive writers could easily have turned out a Dead Clam.Nicole Kidman isn't glamorized. Her beauty is earthy rather than supernal. Her hair is an unsightly mop of long red curls. She doesn't wear any noticeable make up and looks like the fresh-faced eighteen-year-old Australian girl that she was, cherubically plump. Sam Neill has a face that's trustworthy and intelligent. (He was fine as a brooding churchman in A Cry in the Dark.) He's well cast. Try to imagine John WAYNE in this role. Billy Zane is properly maniacal, with his greaseball presence and toothy smile and his adolescent whining about how nothing is HIS fault.The photography is memorable, especially considering the limitations of the setting -- two boats in a calm sea. Only the musical score disappoints. Sometimes it's effectively understated but at other times we get the emetic demonic chanting that could have been ripped off from a dozen other less notable movies. One of the things I like most about this story is that it has no supernatural element. Everything that happens could actually have happened. No devils required. Let's deep six that chanting, shall we? Nicely done and recommended.

It's the confined location of the open sea and the cut-off-from-the-world atmosphere that make Dead Calm great, along with all-around excellent filmmaking, including the breathtaking cinematography and magnificent score by Graeme Revell.Neill shows that he has the gravitas to carry a film as the male protagonist, which is why he was snagged for 1993's Jurassic Park. Kidman similarly shines as the female protagonist in her first major motion picture. Incidentally, Neill was 41 and Kidman 21 at the time of filming. Likewise, Zane de-shines as the antagonist and shows why he was picked for the villain of 1997's Titanic. There's not much dialogue because this is a visually/musically based film and not dialogue-driven.

Why hasn't it been done more often? Well, sea or mountains are not the best friends for shooting fast and cheap. What's more, a yacht is too much upper-class for the hero to be a common Joe.Dead Calm was somewhere in my list of movies I'd like to watch for years. Now I eventually saw it I'm definitely not disappointed my expectations (based on the one-line synopsis 1 couple on a sailing boat, then a strange newcomer from a wrecked ship joins) were not deceived.Yet, since a yacht seems so great a suspense setup in itself, it is not perfect. Especially the part where we have a double-suspense and we have to intercut between the two boats is not well edited, perhaps not well written to begin with. There is no sense of the same urgency, of a common rhythm; the concurrent actions build their own suspense but each one runs against the other one's rhythm. The end (studio cold feet) is close to a slasher movie cliché, but that didn't change my general view on it. It's not as if I'd been cheated after all the movie started in maximum pathos (actually a shrewd lazy way to start a story characters hardly talk to each other) and ends up kinda over-the-top. Characters are really not well written, they only serve the purpose of this suspense on those boats, and their story works pretty well.

Out on the Dead Calm Pacific Ocean waters, they find handsome Billy Zane (as Hughie Warriner) in distress. He claims his boat is sinking and everyone else on board has died from food poisoning. As this seems a likely story, they rescue the attractively shirtless and suspicious-looking Mr. Zane. This leads to the problems you'd expect, under these circumstances. This situation, probably done best by Roman Polanski in Knife in the Water (1962), is built on the supposition that the handsome newcomer may be dangerous and will reveal an aggressive sexual interest in the pretty woman. The cast is attractive, the formula works and the photography (by Dean Semler) is beautiful.****** Dead Calm (4/7/89) Phillip Noyce ~ Nicole Kidman, Billy Zane, Sam Neill, Rod Mullinar "},{"Title":"Suspense at its best","Date":"19 January 2014","Score":"","Genre":"Thriller","Review":" Nicole Kidman and Sam Neill play Rae and John, a couple on a sailing vacation to help them recover after a major tragedy. When they spot a schooner dead in the water, and a man, Hughie (Billy Zane), rowing towards them, they pick him up and listen to his story of an entire crew killed by food poisoning. John doesn't trust Hughie's story so he rows over to the schooner to investigate, leaving his wife alone with Hughie. What follows is a suspenseful game of cat and mouse between the two staged within the cramped confines of the sailboat. Meanwhile John discovers the truth behind the deaths of the crew, and things go from bad to worse as he becomes trapped on the sinking ship. Billy Zane is almost pitch perfect as the semi-lovable Zane-y psychotic trying to seduce Rae. Kidman also puts in a great performance, and looks gorgeous doing it. Neill is great as always. The lighting is effective and the haunting score by Graeme Revell adds just the right finishing touch. This film has just the right balance of drama and suspense with a dash of horror thrown in.

Not just concentrating on the plot about to ensue, we deal with the two characters (Kidman and his much older husband, Neill) and the tragic situation prefore, the catalyst for this trip, and I'm not gonna go into that. These performers don't outperform each others. They're two great actors, living their situation that their suspense. They take off on a beautiful big boat out onto the placid and sparkling waters of the Pacific. You almost wanna be there swimming. The plot builds up, when a lone seaman, Zane, in a dingy comes rowing towards them. He harvests a dark secret. He's a psychopath. And when he boards Neil's boat, Neil takes off to check out the other boat who's engine died, as Zane's story sounds suss. What follows is a great suspense through story and situation. Zane, the mostly calm, other times exploding psychopath is like something I've never seem. He brings such normalcy and humanity to the role, where underneath he's got problem. Just ask the whole dead crew on the only ship that's slowly flooding, and a big storm is forecast. Apart from a stupid improbable after ending with Zane's character, Dead Calm is thrilling entertainment, a lot of fun I can imagine for it's writers. There's a nice little sex scene with Zane and Kidman too. Newcomer Zane does steal the show, another good star that faded out. This is one movie you wouldn't wanna sea, see remade.

The claustrophobic setting also adds a terrifying element to the film, the feeling that you cannot escape the situation you are in.

A few things stand out above the critical reviews. There is an odd relationship between the two protagonists. They are recovering from the death of a child in an auto accident by taking their sailing yacht for a cruise. Their  attachment to each other is profound, but reticent. They don't have a great need to articulate their grief or their love for each other. It just exists.It kind of roughly reminds me of the man and wife in Hemingway's Snows of Kiljmanjaro. If too much is said it just goes away. They are separated by circumstances that could not have been predicted. Once they are there, they are attracted back to each other in an almost primal desire to be together. The need to be reunited overcomes any other need, except that of survival, which exists only to reunite. It kind of surpasses romanticism and delves into a primitive, almost feral need for each other. Both  have great skills at seamanship. The wife has the ability to sail, equal to her husband, a naval officer. She uses all those skills to find him. She has a repugnance for physical violence but is willing to do whatever is necessary to reunite. She is more remorseless then the adversary aboard her boat, who is insane. If I have any criticism it is the ending. This must have been the era of Fatal Attraction where you could not kill the evildoer just once, but twice. Just when it seems they are dead they rise again. This kind of stuff gets boring and predictable real fast. This movie should have ended when the Nicole Kidman character punched holes in the empty life raft with a flare gun.  She placed the villain's wounded body in the raft and set it afloat.  They then ran across the raft on their way home. This is the first film in which that I had seen Niclole Kidman and I was impressed then, and continued to be impressed by this excellent and versatile actress. Soon, I think, Tom Cruise should be known as they guy that was once married to Nicole Kidman. Let's face it, she has more range, more skills as an actor, and she taller.

I am pleased to state that it has lost none of its power.This is surely a classic suspense film. Actually it is one of the best suspense films of the 80s. The storyline is basic yet gripping in the extreme. Even if the mechanisms of the plot bear some usual cliches (the fragile heroine suddenly becomes a tough survivor; she has to seduce and sleep with the bad guy to divert his attention; the hero leaves the heroine alone with a total stranger in the middle of nowhere without even thinking of the possible consequences; the psychopathic bad guy rises once again for a final messy ending and so on) the film has such a unique set-up and atmosphere that it becomes easy to forgive its weaknesses. It is interesting to note that dialogue is actually sparse which consequently necessitates some style for the film to become effective. Director Philip Noyce certainly succeeded in this task. He was clearly very ambitious while making this and he injected everything he could in terms of style. His efforts were amply rewarded since he continued with a highly prolific Hollywood career. However none of his later films had much distinction (including the much overrated Tom Clancy adaptations) and Dead Calm is still his best film do date. The sea, the sky, the two boats and the isolation resulting from being on the wide open sea are eerily combined and as a result the viewer is completely drawn into the story. Working on sea is always a hard thing as demonstrated with widely reported on-set troubles of recent water-pics such as Waterworld, Cutthroat Island and Deep Blue Sea; however, the makers of this film manage to make it look all so easy. The changes in the sea and weather conditions are so smoothly integrated into the film that most of the time you forget this was filmed and feel as if this really took place and those people are alone by themselves at sea.The three leads, all major stars nowadays, are fine and interesting to watch. When I first saw it, I was aware that Nicole Kidman was a rising star in her home country and that this became her international breakthrough. She had striked me with her otherworldly beauty as well as her acting ability. Watching her tonight, I once again admired her determination which made her a big star in her own right despite the always looming presence of her fantastically famous husband. Her ability to attain important roles in major movies was most of the time attributed to her spouse's links and the couple's spiritual affiliations. While some of this may be true, it is also very clear that she is a very talented actress (just remember To Die For) and one of the few noble-looking stars around, in the best tradition of legends such as Grace Kelly and Audrey Hepburn. She is always a delight to watch and has academical training to boot. It is no surprise that 12 years after the making of Dead Calm, she is on the Hollywood A-list.Sam Neill was more famous than his co-stars during that time following his starring roles in many British television series in early Eighties. He has become a household name now in many different genres, be it a big-budget extravaganza such as Jurassic Park or an arthouse period picture such as The Piano and the conviction he brings to his scenes alone on the sinking boat and his performance during the calculated survival tactics makes you realize the reason why. Billy Zane was an immediate center of attention in this film due to his extremely good looks and it is nice to see that he has not followed the usual Hollywood path of becoming the bland leading man in the intervening years. He made different acting choices instead and alternated supporting roles in big films-see Titanic- with more indie-oriented low budget pictures. He even made a credible comic hero in the much-maligned The Phantom. However it is apparent that being a bad guy suits him more, considering his performances here and in Titanic.On the more technical side, the cinematography is simply a joy to watch; production design, which here naturally consists mainly of the design of the ship is effective and makes good use of the limited space indoors and outdoors; sound design is simple albeit effective in reflecting the natural sounds of a ship sailing at sea. The opening car accident is very realistic and gives you the creeps. An honourable mention also goes to composer Graeme Revell whose first big assignment this film was. His pulsating and breathing score makes the viewer literally breathless and in the later scenes the use of a solo soprano voice brings a definitely haunting quality to the proceedings. A sparkling Hollywood career was in the waiting and he created memorable music for many distinguished Hollywood films, mainly in the action-suspense-fantasy genres.And finally, a real surprise the dog dies.Overall rating 8 out of 10 "},{"Title":"Not bad but silly finale","Date":"2 June 2000","Score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Thriller","Review":"  Sam Neill did his usual credible job and Nicole Kidman held her own.

Dead Calm however is a movie that stands out in originality, due to having a simple yet original and effective concept.Greatest strength of this movie is the fact that it's set almost entirely on the open sea. For most part, the movie has just 3 characters in it (not counting in the dog). It gives the movie a certain sense of claustrophobia, paranoia and tension, without having feature too many thriller moments. The atmosphere and settings are enough for this movie to become a tense thriller.Of course it's not a movie without its flaws. The movie perhaps could held on to its mystery a bit longer for instance. The movie now reveals things pretty early on already, while it perhaps could had been better and more effective if things got build up a bit more steady. Despite its originality it's still foremost pretty much a predictable movie, due to the way it's progressing. Still it remains the best Phillip Noyce movie till date and I'm far from a fan of his thriller-work normally. Still it's disappointing that the movie ends so poorly. The movie deserved a much better ending really.A movie with mainly just 3 characters in it of course also needs to mostly rely on its actors. This movie is fortunate enough to feature 3 more than great actors, who were still fairly much unknown at the time of this movie. It stars Nicole Kidman, Sam Neill and Billy Zane before the world knew them as stars. All give away fine performance but I think it's fair to say that Zane gives away the best performance out of the movie. It's possibly the best role he ever played and it's what makes the movie work out as a tense thriller. He's a memorable psychopath and most of the the movie its tension comes from his character.It's nice to see that such a simple movie, with such a simple concept and limited resources and settings can be such an effective one.

John rows back to the Orpheus and tries to fix the radio so he could get help while on the yacht there's a deadly cat and mouse game being played between Rae and Hughie in the middle of nowhere in the vast Pacific Ocean. The film started with John, an officer in the Australian Navy, coming home for the Christmas holidays only to find out that both Rae and his 4 year-old son Danny were in a car accident, the the boy died on impact and Rae ended up in a coma. Rae needing a lot of medical treatment and rest later decided, together with John, to take a sea cruise on their yacht the Saracen that in the end almost coast them both their lives. Some of the scenes in the movie were very hard to believe with Rae always seeming to get away and having the upper hand when it came to fighting off the dangerous Hughie. Yet she never manages, or wants, to kill him even though Hughie is a mass murderer who would think nothing of killing her. Dead Clam has more then it's share of suspense and the brilliant photography in the way that director, Philip Noyce, uses colors in the movie is so striking that at some point in the film you stop caring what the story is all about and just sit back and watch the scenery. Billy Zane was very hard to gage as the psycho killer Hughie Warriner because he came across more clownish then anything else, even the Ingrem's pet dog Benji liked him. Dead Clam has more then it's share of heavy breathing too with both the actions of Rae and Hughie on the yacht and with John on the Orpheus when he was trying to keep from drowning in a below deck compartment. To keep from going under John sucks on an underwater pipe to get air. Even the movie's theme song at the end had heavy breathing in it mixed with the music. The ending was a bit too much with the movie making Hughie into someone like Michael Myers of Halloween where no matter what you did to him you couldn't kill him!

The film is based on a 1963 novel by Charles F. Williams, which was the basis for the unreleased film The Deep (by Orson Welles) and the later film Dead Calm (by Phillip Noyce). Director Phillip Noyce has made some good films over the years Blind Fury 1989, Patriot Games (1992), Sliver (1993), Clear and Present Danger (1994), The Saint (1997), The Bone Collector (1999).The thriller Dead Calm brought Noyce his greatest acclaim in the United States and turned Nicole Kidman into a star. This film adaptation of the film is much more darker than the novel and a new script was written by Terry Hayes to incorporate the role played by Billy Zane's character. Apart from the sea setting and a mentally disturbed/psychotic individual called Hughie, there is no similarity between the original novel's plot and the film. Seasoned actor Sam Neil adds some class to film and does Nicole Kidmna and Billy Zane. I'm a fan of Billy Zane and this film is his best one.Plot of film A couple, Australian naval officer John Ingram (Neill) and his wife Rae (Kidman), lose their son in a car crash. John hopes that some time alone will help Rae cope (she was driving the car) and the couple head out for a vacation alone on their yacht. In the middle of the Pacific they encounter a drifting boat that seems to be taking on water. A man, Hughie Warriner (Zane), rows over to the Ingrams' boat for help. He claims that the boat is sinking and that his companions have all died of food poisoning.Well is Hughie telling the truth? Watch this masterpiece by Noyce and find out what happens next. The sound effects in the film enhances it immensely and add its atmosphere.Verdict What are you waiting for, BUY IT!Some great thrillers to see/buy The Hitcher (1986), The Nature Of The Beast (1995), When The Bough Breaks (1994), The Hand That Rocks The Cradle (1992), The Stepfather Trilogy Of Films 1987-1989-1992), The Hannibal Lector films Manhunter, Red Dragon, Silence Of The Lambs, Hannibal and Hannibal Rising.

The movie begins with a happy couple in their ship, until one nuts guy comes out of nowhere through a boat in the water and enters in their ship without even asking. I don't know if Australian culture in 90's is much different from mine, since it would be extremely uneducated to do such thing; more than that, the invader goes straight to a bedroom, and the owners of the ship (Kidman and Neill) don't think it's any problem. The whole story is pretty odd and so is the directing; Billy Zane is the best actor in this picture and he resembles Timothy Olyphant in many scenes. The scenario is beautiful at times, Australia is full of beautiful oceans. In the end, thought the movie isn't any masterpiece, it's a good entertainment with a fresh subject to the time it was released.

From then on, our hitchhiker (Billy Zane), an attractive scoundrel, takes control of the couple and of the plot, in a story filled with contrived situations and stupid decisions.Except for the first seven minutes, which are largely irrelevant to the rest of the story, the plot consists of just those three characters the man, his wife, and a maniacal hitcher. With an absence of civilization, there should have been plenty of tension. Yet strangely, I never sensed any, mostly owing to a curious lack of twists and surprises. Nor is there any subtext. What you see here is what you get. Indeed, the shallow plot continues only because both the man and his wife make a number of idiotic decisions.Even though the plot sinks the film, the high seas visuals are beautiful. A couple of sunset shots in the second half combined with exotic background music render a nice atmosphere. Lots of close-ups, even extreme close-ups, convey a claustrophobic feel.Sam Neill and Billy Zane are well cast. But I could have wished for another actress to replace annoying Nicole Kidman and her long straggly hair. The only character I cared anything about was Ben, the little dog on the yacht.Dead Calm, despite some pleasant visuals, lacks tension. The plot comes across as perfunctory and contrived, with an ending that is totally not credible. The viewer can find similar, but more satisfying, films.

First, the introduction is useless, except that it points out that Neil's character has had some training. Unless there's some deeper meaning to the movie that I haven't picked up on. Second, the tacked on ending was not a problem in itself, it was the way that they handled it. I would have much rather seen a short fight, a little hand-to-hand combat, rather than the simplistic, silly quick end to it.However, this film is remarkable, because boat-themed movies generally don't do it for me. In every genre, when it takes place on a boat, I usually have a hard time paying attention. But this movie managed to do it reasonably well.It's a good rent, and it's a bit more tense than I would expect from a psychofilm.

Also, Nicole has the killer with a harpoon to his throat (after he tried to kill her), but does she kill him?  Of course not.

But as fate would have it, the only boat they come across for weeks just happens to be sinking, and the only survivor of a food poisoning epidemic on board is now their new passenger (Billy Zane). Neill soon discovers that poisoning is the last thing that killed the passengers on that doomed boat, and that he has just left his wife on board their yacht with a murderer. The rest of the movie revolves between Neill and Kidman, as both try to reach each other -- he to save her from the madman, and she to save him from drowning. I rented this movie because the plot is just one of those where it sounds really interesting, and most reviews on the film were positive. While it's not a perfect movie, for once, I was not disappointed when I finally saw it. In fact, it delivered more than I had expected. There is very little dialogue, strictly enough to keep the movie going. And the music is almost absent, but when it comes, it feels just right. The acting is also great, mainly Kidman and Zane. For these reasons, this thriller delivers the goods. However, Neill's character is seriously underdeveloped and uninteresting, while Kidman is given nothing to do but play nice to Zane, who has the best role in the film. Many situations in the movie are forced on us, asking us to throw logic out the window for the sake of keeping the movie afloat. Kidman waits so long to attack, even when the opportunity is right in front of her. There are many times over that she could have knocked Zane out or even killed him, but she never takes the plunge. Instead, she fakes sexual interest in him, while he, a bit too trusting of his victims, constantly leaves her alone below decks, and lets her run around as if nothing were even wrong. The movie really needed a better villain, because Zane never hurts Kidman unless she becomes a problem, and even then, he just pulls her hair and shouts. To think that this guy just slaughtered everyone aboard his last voyage seems almost unlikely. He doesn't seem to pose a threat. Besides that, there's some confusing subplot involving video footage of Zane's last mission and his abuse by the other people that almost makes you feel sorry for him. But the whole story is never fleshed out. For this movie's great acting, ability to carry on many action scenes with no music (and when the music plays it is beautiful), superb setting (the open sea never looked better), and skillful use of characters and tension, I give this film *** stars out of ****. It is better than most thrillers I have seen in my life and I certainly haven't seen one like it in a long time. I was not disappointed, for once. But if only they could have scrapped the ending, it did not do justice to the rest of the picture. Great atmosphere, though. Big kudos to this film for keeping the whole thing going with only three actors and two sets. Terrific. See this film, you might not find one like it for a long time.

While he is asleep, John takes his rowing boat and rows over to the other ship to see for himself.This is the rather promising start of this thriller. The setting is perfect. The ocean is seemingly endless and completely empty (with the exception of the deserted ship). One really feels that these people are alone in this world.Of course, John detects something very unpleasant on the deserted ship and of course, the hitcher is not exactly a good guy. That is predictable but forgivable, since most thrillers are predictable to a certain extent. However, as the story unfolds it seems that the director slowly looses his grip. I won't describe this in detail, but just let me mention one thing. Towards the end of the movie Rae is sailing the yacht alone apparently for the first time through pretty heavy sea. (The magnitude of the waves varies ridiculously between cuts, by the way.) I would have thought she would have had more than enough with sailing the boat, but no. She first stands in the front of the sea staring out over the ocean before she enters the mast (which is at least 30 feet high!). I may be no seaman, but this looks just plain silly and unbelievable. However, this is nothing compared to the final scene, which must be one of the silliest in movie history.

Get it at Amazon.)The first few minutes suggest Polanski's Knife in the Water with harbingers of the Coleridge poem, The Rime of the Ancient Mariner. But this is a film with its intent squarely on the box office; and, aside from the riveting Nicole Kidman, whose sensual vitality dominates the film, nothing so interesting materializes. Nonetheless the tension is nearly unbearable even though it's all predictable the idyllic couple aboard their yacht alone on the open ocean take on a psychopath whose ship is sinking. Well, we can see he's a nut case from the first grin, and our first thought is, keep him away from your wife! So naturally the husband, played with leading man true grit by Sam Neill, leaves her alone with him while he pokes around in the other vessel with anticipated horrific consequences.The close ups on Nicole Kidman's face are so intense you can feel her skin and almost smell her breath. She proves to be quite an actress as she wrestles with the psycho, played with such fidelity by Billy Zane that I found myself repeatedly urging her to shoot the sickie.As the situation rapidly becomes impossible for our heroic couple, we realize that it's all very stagy, and upon further thought, fake; yet the intense photography, the seemingly veracious nautical business, and the fine acting by all, plus all that water, make it almost real. Very far out from reality however is the final scene where psycho-boy comes back to life, so to speak, and then takes a flare right in the-well, watch it and see.Incidentally, it is interesting to compare this Nicole Kidman with the one seen nowadays. Clearly she has matured and become more shapely; but I wonder, did she also have some work done on her mouth? Her lips seem fuller and more perfectly shaped. Regardless, she is a charismatic, hard-working, very serious actress who may eventually have a career to match, say, Jane Fonda or even Shirley MacLaine.

Although I have to admit that the beginning of the film had captivated my attention. The mood was good and then I did a little research on the film, since it is Australian, then I must say it is an Aussie gothic flick, which reminds me of Jane Champion and Peter Wier. The beginning of the film is suspenseful, but the Nicole driving and accident part was not too convincing. Then when I saw them on the water, I immediately thought of Polanski's Knife in the water.  (Maybe I watched too many art films and the commercial versions just don't seem to match it?)  Anyway, as the film goes on, the suspense of Zane haunting Nicole while Neils is trapped in the other dead ship, then we see how Nicole turns from a weak woman into a determine heroine just doesn't work. I think it is because Nicole's expressionless face which also was in The portrait of a lady  but, at least she has nice blue eyes and a featureless face to match.  I would probably give credit to the music and the pace of the film if anything. I guess it is in the Australian blood to make creepy atmospheric films.  The ending was a Carrie effect if anyone remembers the end of that famous movie, you know, you seen it all in Friday the 13..... Except this one is done with a bit more style.  No wonder average Americans liked it.  We seen too much horror garbage and since this thriller with a bit of class came along... everyone praised it.

I guess it tries hard to be a serious thriller, yet I can't take anything very seriously on a sailboat in the middle of nowhere. Phillip Noyce directed it, and, besides the two Jack Ryan movies he directed, he's made a couple of seriously flawed films (The Saint, Sliver). Maybe this movie takes itself a little too seriously.I far prefer a campier version, like Kill Cruise (with Jurgen Prochnow, Jennifer Rubin, and Patsy Kensit) There the captain is a drunk, and his two passengers are the lowest form of party girls. When the crap starts to hit the fan there, you expect it. You've waited for it. You want it. You love it.Here it's hard to imagine why Nicole Kidman didn't just kill Billy Zane any of the 1st  50 or so opportunities she had. The sort of needless and forced tension her hesitancy produces tends to lose my interest quickly. In the film's so called climax, she performs the Herculean task of driving the boat, and shining the light, and pulling her husband-200lbs of wet, exhausted man-to safety from a fast-moving boat.

In this version Australian Navy Captain Kidman comes home on leave to find Mrs Kidman has had a road accident in which their young son has died. To come to terms with this, they go sailing in the pacific on a yacht. Thirty days from nowhere they sight an elderly barque dead in the water. A bronzed and handsome young man rows frenziedly over to them. He claims that the others on board have died of food poisoning, and the ship is sinking. Rather than report this to the authorities, Captain Kidman rows over to investigate. Our psycho knocks Mrs K unconscious and drives off. Captain K finds traces of murder and sexual mayhem on the barque, then gets trapped below decks as it sinks. Meanwhile Mrs K has trouble dealing with the psycho. In an attempt to disarm him she apparently agrees to have sex with him, but her plan (to blow his brains out with the ship's shotgun) goes wrong and she ends up under him. There is some but not much ambiguity about whether she enjoyed the experience. But afterwards, she redoubles her efforts to get rid of him. After many a chase through the yacht, she skewers him with a harpoon gun (having previously skewered the ship's dog) and throws him overboard onto a liferaft. She then heads off across the ocean to find hubby, picking him up just as he is about to drown. Next morning all is sweetness and light on the calm bosom of the ocean. Captain K goes down to the galley to make breakfast (given the earlier damage to the yacht, it is unclear how). Psycho of course reappears (he had only been playing dead) and is about to throw Mrs K overboard when the captain reappears and with a well-aimed distress rocket to the mouth, knocks the frying psycho into the sea. Now for a happy ending. It was all quite pacey and well put together, though the scenes on the barque of the captain escaping from drowning were a bit far fetched. The young Ms Kidman acted and sailed her socks off, and there was clearly some (implausible) chemistry between her and the psycho. However, the whole thing fell down because there was no substantial explanation of the psycho's motives.

After the death of their son, Rae and John Ingram take a sailing trip to calm their nerves. One day they rescues a young artist named Hughie Warriner, from a wrecked schooner. He claims that the crew is dead and the ship is sinking. When John goes on board to investigate he discovers that no only is the crew dead but they were murdered. Leaving him to go down with the ship, Hughie then takes off in The Ingram's boat with Rae. How is she gonna get back to her husband across miles of open water?Dead Calm is another case of good premise with mediocre execution. The problem is quite simple, there is not enough tension. Despite being in the middle of the ocean with a killer, it never feels like Rae is in dire trouble. Part of it has to do with the character of Hughie who is too far from menacing to provoke fear. Billy Zane, in his first decent sized role, does not really know what he is doing. He plays the role too quirky with no sense of menace. Nichole Kidman isn't very convincing either, and doesn't show the slightest bit of fearful emotion in her role. Quite frequently, she even delivers her lines as if nothing is happening. (there is a killer on board for crying out loud!)The only part of the movie which generates some tension are the scenes with John on board the sinking schooner. fighting to survive as the water level is rising, poses much more of a threat, in my opinion. One of Dead Calm better qualities is its music, creative and abstract. the film is nicely photographed too. I think we take the spectacle of sea pictures for granted, It is hard enough to set up a camera on a rocking boat let alone set it up and get a good shot.In the end Dead Calm is not a bad film, but it's kind of dull and it didn't scare me, and if you've already seen Misery, I doubt it will scare you too.

Without the dresses and the tresses and the machine-tooled makeup, she looked--and sounded--just wonderful, something like her appearance in the first movie in which I saw her, Dead Calm. In that 1988 thriller, at the just-past-her-teens age of 21, Kidman was able to show enough screen presence to avoid being just eye candy and to move on to bigger and better projects. She was a lovely girl and that backside of hers was proof that God is an artistic God.I remember the movie for three things It was good to see Sam Neill again after many years, Kidman was breathtaking, and, although the film was suspenseful through much of its running time, it fell apart at the end because--I think--it had some sort of illogical climax.Yet, almost twenty years later, I still am astonished by how much physically-stimulating beauty Kidman had. In Billy Bathgate, she's totally nude and you're thinking that you're looking at one of the most naturally beautiful women on the planet, this with the big brain and not the little one. In To Die For, she's as old school movie-beautiful as is possible. Eyes Wide Shut is just over the top with the little brain and the big brain getting into a shouting match over which is more important--physical sexiness or beauty.Now, with Kidman a few months shy of forty, she has attacked her own beauty with what appears to be the use of Botox and little bags of silicone. The diva-esquire hair, the fright-mask make-up, and the fashionista clothing are taking a toll.Nicole Kidman is a fine actress. She's has been proving that for two decades. Looking like a Hollyweirdo is a sin against the god that created her. In Dead Calm, she was a breath of fresh air.As she enters her forties, I hope she doesn't let that air go stale.

I wasn't sure what to expect when I watched it, but let me tell you it was one of the first films that I have seen that would not allow me to pinpoint a direct love or hate. At the beginning, when the plot was taking it's time to take off, I was not enjoying this film. I felt that I was having trouble really understanding John and Rae and the relationship that they have. I think this stayed with me throughout the film, and when they finally split up I finally began to enjoy it. I thought that there were some really wild scenes in this film. The infamous rape scene was intense. I never saw that coming at all. The chemistry between Zane and Kidman was perfect, while the connection between Rae and John was not. I think, honestly, Sam Neill was miscast in this film, or he was trying to play too deeply into his character. At first I felt that we were watching a film about robots, but then I saw our characters go into the water and I knew that technology wasn't around in the 80s (for fear of other crew being shocked). I also had trouble distinguishing the ethnic background of the characters. Kidman was heavy on the Australian accent, but Neill and Zane seemed almost American. Not that this normally makes any difference, but I think it would have put these characters on sturdier ground. I don't know my exact feelings on this film. It was good, it was bad, then it somehow seemed good again. The ending was completely laughable. I really thought they should have just ended with the two of them in each other's arms, but instead they had toss in there a classic clichéd Hollywood moment. It was a well rounded film, but somehow some edges were getting dull. It is almost like having a flat spot on your tire. You hear the noise, but know that you can continue driving if you want to. For those of you out there that are considering watching this film because you are a fan of Kidman, I would have you look at both sides of the story. This is not the best work from her, but it does give us a good indication on where she is going with her acting career. Second, she does get naked. So, if acting doesn't matter and you would rather see Kidman naked, than Dead Calm may be the film for you. I don't know why I am so wishy-washy with this film, but I can't seem to want to say if it was bad or good. Rather, more of a combination of both. The scenes with Kidman and Zane are the best, while Neill is what brought this film down. Nothing was revealed prior about him (or rather about anyone), so it is hard to connect with the characters, but it does carry some decent suspense. Overall, if you find this film for free somewhere, I think you should get it, but I wouldn't spend more than a penny on this film.Grade *** out of *****  "},{"Title":"Dead calm?","Date":"11 October 2003","Score":"1 out of 4 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Thriller","Review":"  Dead angry more like.

Back then; it scared the hell out of me! Re-watching it now, about sixteen years later, it really isn't such a shocking film but still some sequences &#150; one involving the family dog and the fiery climax &#150; are burnt on my retina forever. Just to say Dead Calm can be experienced as a pretty intense thriller by sensitive viewers! Anyway, this Aussie thriller by Phillip Noyce is rather similar to the 1986 classic The Hitcher, with its limited cast of characters and a villain who seemly has no real motivations for his brutal homicidal behavior. Both films are ordinary serial killer flicks without groundbreaking plots, but they work extremely well due to their uniquely isolated filming locations. The Hitcher took place in the rural outback, where hardly any car ever passes by, and the setting of Noyce's thriller is even more inescapable since we're out in the ocean. Recuperating from a recently occurred family tragedy in which they lost their son, John and Rae Ingram go for an extended sailing trip in the lonely Pacific Ocean. Enter Hughie Warriner, a clearly confused sailor who climbs aboard and pretends to be the only survivor of a food poisoning bacteria that eliminated the entire crew of the schooner he worked on. John takes the sloop out to investigate this story, only to spot how Hughie boat-jacks him and sails the opposite direction with his wife & dog still aboard. The rest of the film shows Hughie terrorizing Rae, occasionally intercut by images of John discovering the truth about Hughie's maniacal personality in the slowly sinking schooner. Dead Calm is a fairly slow-paced thriller that especially benefices from the sublime camera-work (by Deam Semler) and the carefully elaborated character drawings. Philip Noyce's main objective clearly was the emphasizing of Nicole Kidman's character Rae, more particularly her metamorphosis from a docile and vulnerable wife into a strong and independent woman. The overall tone of the film is quite chilling, with one or two sequences that stand out, but it's nevertheless a little too long and drags from time to time. Nicole Kidman clearly wasn't the great actress she is nowadays, but her performance is adequate and Billy Zane overacts slightly &#150; just slightly &#150; as the psychopath.

The opening of the movie, revolving around the death of John and Rae's young son in a car accident, was startling and grabbed me right away, and the introduction of Hughie - the survivor from the stricken boat - added a solid amount of mystery, both about him and about what happened on the broken down boat. The environment (except for the very opening the action in the movie was entirely on either of the two boats) was appropriately claustrophobic, which added to the tension.Having said those things, there were a couple of weaknesses. In addition to the lack of originality in the story line, I have to say that I detected no real chemistry between Sam Neill and Nicole Kidman as John and Rae (thankfully, that problem was somewhat compensated for by the fact that, in spite of the fact that their characters were married they actually had very few scenes together, since the characters spent most of the movie on the different boats.) The ending went on one scene too long, as we were forced to deal once again with the bad guy who just won't die, in spite of the fact that all the evidence says he should be dead. (That's just become too standard in this kind of movie. There would be greater surprise if the bad guy was actually dead!)

They rescue a young man named Hughie Warriner (Billy Zane) from the sinking ship & he says that the rest of the crew died from food poisoning. John is suspicious & decides to take a look for himself & rows over to the schooner, while there he discovers the rest of the crew were actually murdered by the psychotic Hughie who back on-board the Saracen has overpowered Rae, started the engines & disappeared into the distance leaving John stranded on a sinking boat & Rae a helpless prisoner...This Australian American co-production was directed by Phillip Noyce & I have to say that I thought Dead Calm was a rather dull psycho thriller that didn't really grab my attention. The script by Terry Hayes was based on the novel 'Dead Calm' by Charles Williams which by all accounts is actually very different from this filmed adaptation, while the basic plot is quite good with the isolated Ocean setting, the psychotic villain who kidnaps a woman & steals a boat while the hero is left stranded on a sinking ship I found the scripting to be quite poor at times. For instance why didn't Rae use the radio to call the mainland for help? She clearly has plenty of time as she communicates with her husband John on several occasions, why not call the coastguard & say they were sinking & needed immediate assistance? Also I couldn't buy Hughie as the psycho at all, why did he let Rae run around the boat on her own? Did he not think she might do something to try & escape? I mean keep her in your line of sight at the very least surely? Hughie is never given any motivation for anything he does, he doesn't seem to have any sort of clear plan or need or idea what he's going to do. The sex scene between Rae & Hughie just comes out of nowhere & seems totally unnecessary & I just thought the character's were really poorly written. I did like the aspect of the script which turned the idea of John having to rescue Rae on it's head & actually have Rae need to rescue John instead but I just felt the film could have been a lot better, a lot more tense & a lot more gripping.One really should try to watch Dead Calm in it's full 2351 widescreen ratio as Noyce often fills the extreme edges of the frame (like the Saracen at one edge with the schooner on the other to give some sense of distance for instance) with images & using the full width of the frame to portray the vastness & emptiness of the Ocean which is lost on horrible pan and scan editions of the film. At almost 100 minutes in length I actually though Dead Calm was a fairly slow moving film considering not that much happens & there's only ever three people in it. The 'Plot' outline on the IMDb main page for Dead Calm makes it sound a lot more exciting, interesting & action packed than it actually is. This was the second time Charles Williams novel had been adapted into a film the first being The Deep (1970) written & directed by Orson Welles although it was never actually finished & remains uncompleted & unreleased to this day.The film looks nice enough & the widescreen cinematography is pleasing although shots of the Ocean do tend to get a little bit repetitive after 90 odd minutes of them. Actually filmed in Australia around the likes of the Gold Coast & the Great Barrier Reef. Dead Calm was Nicole Kidman's first leading role & afterwards went to the US & became a huge star, here she puts in a fairly bland performance although she does get her breasts out & bares her bum. Billy Zane as the psycho also gets to show off his bare bum & also puts in a fairly poor performance for me, he has no threat about him whatsoever. Sam Neill does alright & puts in the best performance out of the three.Dead Calm is a film which has a pretty good basic plot but suffers from a bad script with poor character's who you can't care about & a lack of dramatic incident which ultimately sinks the film without trace much like the Orpheus. Could have been great in the right hands as it is it's no better than average.

First of all, it puzzles me why John left his wife all alone with a total stranger whom he didn't trust as he went to inspect the other boat. And we don't really know what happened to the passengers of that boat. John freaked out when he saw them dead but he still didn't have proof that Hughie killed them. And Hughie must have trusted Rae very much as he didn't tie her up or lock her in a room or something. She was free to walk around the boat and radio her husband. Of course it had to take so much time for her to realize that she might try to kill that guy who had prevented her husband from getting back on board. And of course Hughie, being a trusting man, decided to have sex with Rae as she must have forgotten all about her husband when she saw how handsome Hughie was. Finally Rae remembered she had a gun on the boat but it was of no use to her as she didn't know what to do with it once she saw Hughie who didn't make any use of the gun as well since the drugs she had given him started to kick in just when he was about to shoot her. Finally of course it was so logical for indecisive Rae to bash Hughie with the gun and shove him into the ocean. No! She didn't just push him out, she had laid out a lifeboat for him first. She cared for him so much I guess. The ending is just as bad when we see Hughie miraculously emerge from dead and tries to kill Rae who doesn't even scream. Of course he's not quick enough because John shoots him straight in the head. 'Dead Calm' isn't a boring movie, it's just the inconsistencies what makes it suck.

He's soon aware that something involving deliberate murder is what has happened to one of the poor victims, a dead woman whose body emerges from a container. On his way back to his own yacht, he sees the man has gotten out of the locked room and appears to be struggling with his wife.The suspense at this point goes into high gear. Kidman and Zane are alone on the boat and she starts probing about whatever happened on the other vessel. Meantime, her hubby is still aboard the ghost ship looking for clues. Very slowly, some revelations occur but at this point the plotting is mainly a matter of mind games between Zane and his captive, Kidman. He forms a romantic attachment to her and she has to pretend to go along with it to save her life.To give any more of the plot away would be foolish. Let's just say it keeps you in suspense until the dangerous situations are resolved and all three actors have very physically demanding roles.SAM NEILL is excellent as the husband trying to get back to his wife and BILLY ZANE is convincing enough as the lowdown heel with a bogus story about what really happened aboard the boat. NICOLE KIDMAN plays the trapped wife with her usual skill.Manages to be a taut thriller most of the time, although it's pretty manipulative in the way it forces some foolish choices on its characters.

While this doesn't give the film much credibility, it does at least ensure that it is entertaining for its duration. Claustrophobic thrillers set about a ship have been great in the past; Roman Polanski's Knife in the Water being the benchmark. I don't know if director Phillip Noyce used the sixties film as an inspiration, but I actually hope he didn't; as characters were the most important element in Polanski's film, whereas they're nonexistent here. The plot follows a couple - Rae and John Ingram - who are recovering from an automobile accident that claimed the life of their young son. They've taken to the seas to take in the relaxed atmosphere, but they don't get what they came for when they pick up Hughie Warriner; the only survivor from another ship. When Warriner's story doesn't check out, John boards the boat; and finds his own ship and his wife sailing off into the sunset without him.My main reason for seeing this film was the fact that it stars Nicole Kidman. I'm actually a big fan of Kidman's, but here she isn't given much to do and her complete lack of chemistry with the two male leads is a huge disappointment. Sam Neill has impressed me in the likes of Andrzej Zulawski's Possession, but here he's given even less to do than Kidman and doesn't even have that much screen time. Billy Zane would be the pick of the cast if he could do anything at all with maniac psycho role. He merely looks like some guy acting mental for the duration, and to be honest I'm not sure how he ended up being typecast in this sort of role. Unfortunately, all this stuff actually makes Kidman the pick of the cast, despite the fact that she's sub-par. The plot does play out rather well, however, and while it's clear that nothing completely out of the ordinary (for this sort of film) is going to happen, and several 'twists' such as the ending are far too easy to see coming; I will say that this film just about does it's job in the entertainment stakes, and comes recommended to anyone that simply wants something to watch.

Anyway, this aired during the night on TV, so I decided to tape it and see if it was any good. Let me beat around the bush no longer. It isn't. Not at all. The only interesting thing about the film is that it tries to pull off the same thing Alien did; a secluded and limited space, with only a few characters and no interaction from the outside. Unfortunately, it fails this attempt miserably. The plot is basically a lift of Alien, with some minor changes to remove the science fiction and bring it down to earth. Even worse, at the end, the film throws away any remaining bit of sense it had left from the rest of the film. The pacing is horrid; I was falling asleep most of the time. Nothing ever seemed to happen. Now, don't think this is the opinion of some teenager with a short attention span; I've seen and thoroughly enjoyed a fair bit of Alfred Hitchcock's films. That man knew how to create tension and suspense, a sense of ever-present danger; Philip Noyce, the director of this mess doesn't. The danger, the fear never seems to be there. It was predictable as well, but that wasn't the problem. The thing is, we never get the perspective. Allow me to draw a comparison to recent thriller, Panic Room. We get to see the house the rest of the film takes place in as the very first thing; we get a guided tour, literally. That makes every following scene that much more tense, because we know exactly where the characters are, how far away from each other they are. Heck, we could probably even count the steps on the staircase between them, if we wanted to. No such luck here. I never got a good idea of how big the boat was, how many rooms, how far there was from any one place on the boat to another. The acting is fair, but nothing impressive. The characters are poorly developed, particularly the villain. Who is this guy? What is his past? And what in the world happened on the other boat? These questions are just some of the ones the viewer presents the film fairly early on, and they are never answered. The only positive thing in this film, the one thing that made me sit up and take notice was around the middle-to-near-end where Nicole gets naked on top of Billy Zane(lucky bastard!). Apart from that, there's nothing in this film that would make me even consider sparing it a glance, now that I've seen it. I urge anyone who thinks the plot outline sounds intriguing, go find the novel instead. It can't possibly be any worse than this. I recommend this only to huge fans of the three leads, and guys who are willing to sit through about an hour of pointless film to see Kidman shed her clothes and bare her beautiful body for the camera. Everyone else, avoid this like the plague. 5/10 "},{"Title":"Why is nicole kidman wearing a fright wig??","Date":"7 March 2005","Score":"1 out of 6 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Thriller","Review":" This is one of my pet peeves with movies. They take a beauty like kidman and give her a grotesque hairstyle!!!! What is the point in that? Other than that, the show is OK. A psycho, played very well by billy zane, gets on board a yacht with kidman and her hubby (played by sam neill) on board. The hub ends up on another ship and then it's just kidman and zane battling it out. There's also a dog who has a great scene when kidman steals the keys to the engine. I won't tell you what happened, but just when you're sure that kidman finally has the upper hand, the dog fouls everything up and we're back to square one.Sam Neill is appropriately cast as the boring husband. How he got to be a star is beyond me, though i must admit i love his voice. Anyone that sounds exactly like the great james mason can't be all bad.

Maybe, even a CBC movie. The style, budget, and story is lame. Lame idea and the tension is not there. Kidman did her best, as well as Neil and Zane. I guess these people had to eat and took the job. This movie you watch on TV when you are bored.Hockey and Football season is over and this is what you have left. Stay away from this one. It not the worse, but it not worth wasting your time. Maybe they should have added Elvis too the story. This movie isn't a one but I would give it a three out of ten. If you got to wash your hair or take a walk. Even, wash your car etc. Do it! Nothing you have not seen before. The movie doesn't get better, and the climax is a wimper. I think I would vacuum before I watch this stinker again. Hey this craper will be forgotten in time. I know I will for get about it.

I didn't think it was really all that suspenseful and the background music was intrusive. It reminded me of a bad mixture of Vangelis and Jan Hammer. Thank heavens electronic incidental music for movies has improved dramatically over the years. This music was too insistent on its own importance rather than subtly enhancing the mood. I thought that Nicole Kidman was attractive when her huge mop of hair wasn't getting in the way. Billy Zane was okay as a psychotic killer, but not really all that thrilling. Sam Neill was handsome, and that is about all. I thought that their clever use of flares was a bit overdone. I Really couldn't suggest someone bother with this unless they were really bored.

I can't remember the meaning of the title, probably something to do with Titanic's Billy Zane, or all the film being in the ocean. Basically Rae (Kidman) and John (Sam Neill) Ingram and are on a boat, probably on vacation, and they break down, I think. When they see a ship up ahead they obviously try to get help. Instead they have a survivor in a boat come one their boat. The bad news is that they guy, Hughie Warriner (Zane) chucks John off the boat and kidnaps Rae. John is trying everything he can to find his boat and wife. Some slight disturbing moments, but a good film. Worth watching! "},{"Title":"Brain dead...","Date":"2 December 2007","Score":"2 out of 10 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Thriller","Review":" Nicole Kidman, young and very green (and surprisingly demure) in her first prominent role, playing a wife and mother who suffers a terrible loss while driving on the road, only to recover enough to take a boating trip with her husband which turns deadly after they let aboard a psychotic stranger. Charles Williams' novel becomes a flashy yet standard thriller-at-sea, with a derivative premise so calculated and contrived it seems programmed to follow the basic format for cinematic clichés. The dynamics of the situation (married couple battling a nutcase, as well as the elements of nature) are gripping enough to keep one watching, however director Phillip Noyce brings no subtext to the table--and the cast is kept so inexpressive, we hardly even know what they are thinking. Technically, the film is quite sound, with an interesting use of mood music and songs underlining the action; but Dead Calm is a failure on both a logical and an emotional level, and the personalities of the characters are vanquished by an apparent need to top (or mimic) other films in this genre. ** from **** "}]
