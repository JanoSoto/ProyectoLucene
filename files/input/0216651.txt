The soundtrack also bears mentioning and is right up there with the Hollywood's best.Story-wise, its an eclectic mixture of Gothic horror, Science fiction, Westerns and Samurai, apparently based on a novel I've never read. Its genre cannot be classified simply horror, and while there are plenty of great action scenes, the near-perfect pacing allows for quiet moments of conversation between the characters.Its full of great moments, but the best is the climactic finale - absolutely unforgettable.

From the opening scene, watching the crosses twist and crumble as the dark carriage passes by, you know you're in for something good. VHDB doesn't disappoint.First off, D has been given a major upgrade. He looks more vampire like, he looks stronger and badder than ever before. The new art helps much, of course. D is hired to find a girl named Charlotte, dead or alive, who has been taken by a vampire from her home. Adding to the mix is a bounty team already has a head start on D, and each member of this team could well have his/her own anime. These are no second rate fill-ins, these folks are every bit as interesting as D. The vampire in question doesn't disappoint either, showing the full force of his powers from the very first scenes.All in all, if you're looking for something darker and blood filled, watch this show. It looks dang good, the english voices are much better than you'd expect, and things just simply click. It's well worthy of the VHD name, and surpasses the original in nearly every way.- Rirath_com "},{"Title":"Gripping and gorgeous Vampire D Bloodlust  is a must-see for anime lovers","Date":"15 July 2005","Score":"25 out of 26 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Animation, Action, Adventure","Review":" It is a beautifully created anime!

Meijer Link, a vampire with noble intentions with a human girl, is the first decent vampire we see in the D movies.  You root for him, yet D never loses in battle, so it's really tough watching them fight. We see again D's constant struggle with his self and the life that he leads.  He's stuck between a human life and a vampire's life, never truly fitting into either.  He meets a bounty hunter, Leyla, who finds something truly magnetic about D and his loneliness in that she has felt the same way in her life.

On this quest he's hired for 20 millions dollars by a father of a young girl who was kidnapped by a powerful vampire who plans to take her with him to the stars.

So now the two are in competition to who can get their hands the on the girl (dead or alive) before they get to their destination. But D also suspects that maybe the girl went by her own accord, which throws a spanner into the mix.I used to always watch anime when I was a kid, but it kinda died off me when I got into my late teens. Well, that was until it picked up momentum again when I caught the brilliant 'Neo Genesis Evangelion' anime series a couple years ago. So, now I'm a on and off viewer, but I was glad that I was switched on for this particular one. Being a horror fan and reading the synopsis for the film I thought it sounded great and it was most definitely. But I also learned it was a sequel, which I was worried that I wouldn't have a clue what was going, but that's the not the case here with certain things about our protagonist being explained because they crop up into where the story is heading. It does feels kinda different, especially in the terms of violence by keeping it within the story's limits then going out fall ball with a pointless mess. The stimulating violence is done rather graciously with the easy-going pace suddenly moving like a speeding train when the action occurs. The animation is breath-taking, it's simply eye-candy with distinguishable details and sharp imagination that's pure film-craft at its best. The heavy blanket of Gothic atmosphere that's created breaths down on you with it's dark, grimy apocalyptic feel where there's a wonderful mix of ghoulish terror and sweet innocence. While, this anime has terrifically, garnished up visuals. The story was not to be forgotten, as it's a lyrically, thoughtful tale that's richly developed with an emotional pull that's truly enticing. You could call it a hybrid with a galore of ingredients worked into the story's structure; Horror, Medieval, Western, Fantasy and Sci-fi. These adventurous aspects truly made sure that there were plenty of nifty surprises and a range of highly spirited standoffs between foes with a kicking soundtrack to boot. The moralistic tale builds up an allegory you could say about racism and that of never trusting that of perception, but to look on the inside to find the person's true meaning. The smooth dialogue is quite meaningful and there's patches of dry humour sprinkled across it. The fruitful characters are well-rounded and they add their own little parts to the story. But the star here is the quietly spoken, but extremely deadly D; who's dressed up in his black overcoat and wide-brimmed hat that hides his face. He's not alone as his accompanied by his black horse and that of a talking parasite embedded in his hand.A really compelling and exciting anime piece that delivers all the goods in a marvellous blend.

The illustrative quality is awesome the colors, the character details, the backgrounds&#133;such all round attention, including character development and storyline. There are action sequences to match Hollywood productions, and a love story, too.

Enter, D - A soft-spoken freelance tracker, half-vampire half-human, who makes a living as one of the most feared monster-hunters and Vampire slayers in the world. Though greatly feared by both monster and human alike, his reputation earns him the attention of a rich nobleman, who decides to hire D's services to bring back his beloved and beautiful daughter, Charlotte. In a fantastic display of his unholy power and influence, the powerful and charismatic Vampire Count known as Meier Link has taken Charlotte from her very bedroom, back to his castle to be his bride. However, the plot thickens intensely as the Marcus Brothers (a highly and diversely skilled band of monster slayers), the powerful supernatural creatures of Barbaroi, and an ancient evil force all try to impede D's progress, suggesting that far more is at stake than a young girl's mortality. Before long, D realizes that the abduction is not what it seems, nor is little else. A sinister and world-shaking plot begins to loom over D's seemingly-direct task.As D goes about his hunt, his journey takes him through fantastic landscapes, crossing fascinating creatures, meeting interesting friends and foes, and ultimately reveals a sliver of his own mysterious past. From beautiful ancient ruins to the most incredible Baroque castles, from savage lands ruled by monsters to pleasant villages at the edge of humanity's reach, Bloodlust is an adventure that will leave most Fantasy/Sci-Fi fans hungry for more. The action is nothing short of dynamic and sharp, separated with moments of genuine pathos and depth, this story is well-told with fine voice acting (great English dubbing) and some of the most fluid animation ever seen. This is not so much a movie as it is moving art (a concept that few studios 'remember'). Granted this is in a heavy Fantasy setting, it is so well done that even those who detest such fiction, should be able to appreciate this on at least one level - wonderful animation with an interesting story.If this movie has a failing, it is that it had to end, and that there is no official word of another in the franchise.

Unlike the traditional vampire movie where all the characters are horribly stereotyped and one-dimensional Vampire Hunter D avoids all such clichÃ©s. Although the film does use some of the traditional pure-good characters and pure-evil villains most of them manage to achieve a level of depth that is uncommon among horror or action movies.

But the moment the DVD menu loaded up, I knew I was in for a treat.  This is another film from the director of Ninja Scroll, arguably one of the most amazing animated films in existence, and this one continues in the same vein.  It is sad that anime is regarded as either child's fare or the bastion of geeks and nerds.  But if any movie could change that opinion, it is this one. ** Spoiler Alert** The protagonist/anti-hero of the film is D, the half-vampire/half-human bounty hunter.  He's as dark and brooding as you can get, but I suppose you wouldn't talk much if your father was Dracula (only learned in the first film) and you had lived for thousands upon thousands of years.  Our hero is hired by a wealthy land owner to rescue his daughter who was abducted by the vampire Meier Link.  But all is not as it seems, and villains aren't always evil.  Also hired to rescue her is a family of bounty hunters known as the Markus Brothers. In the movie's big plot twist, the hunters realize that the one pulling all the strings is the vampire Carmila, dead for centuries and now plotting her own resurrection from beyond the grave.  For those with a taste for history, Carmila was actually a real person.  In fact, the vampire legend is based in part on her.  She was a countess back in the day who bathed in the blood of virgins, believing it would make her beauty endless.  The film does not explain this, but if you already know, there are some hints which make the end of the film more understandable and more interesting.  But enough about plot, on to the good stuff. The most obvious thing that one will notice when watching this film is the animation.  It's phenomenal.  No more low frame rate animation from Japan.  This can stand toe-to-toe with Disney, and is far more interesting to watch.  There aren't any saucer-shaped eyes and ridiculous expressions to put yourself through.  The designers did a great job, and the attention to detail shows.  It is very, very easy to forget this is a cartoon.  The scene with the arrow flying towards D when he first meets the Marcus Brothers jumps to mind.  Oh, and let's not forget the bridge scene, with Meier burning in the fading sunlight.  Visually provocative and actually quite affecting. In short, even if you dislike anime, please give this one a try.  I'm not saying you'll become a fan of anime, but I dread the thought that this truly engrossing and beautiful movie will be passed over simply because it is animated.

The movie is different from standard hollywood animated fare which is often too syrupy and rarely tries to push the envelope. This film does that. The animation is gorgeous and very fluid. Unlike many other anime films the translation into english makes perfect sense and you get a better feel of the character's emotions. The story focuses on a half man half vampire hero named D. Because of his strange ancestory D is a loner. He reminds one of the Clint Eastwood lone cowboy types. The film has a few references to Clint Eastwood's classic westerns too. The film centers on a plot to rescue a wealthy man's daughter from a vampire. From scene to scene everything makes sense and it is visually beautiful. I remember this film originally beared the exact title of the original Vampire Hunter which caused great confusion. The producers thankfully changed the name of this a bit to avoid confusion between this film and the original. It was definitely entertaining and bit macabre. One thing, even though this is an animated cartoon IT IS NOT FOR YOUNG CHILDREN. The themes and some of the scenes are too intense for young kids SO PLEASE DO NOT TAKE ANY KIDS TO THIS MOVIE.

It's not that I have anything against animated films; I just don't tend to like them very much. Still, there's a couple that I like and, considering plot, I figured it must be worth a go anyway, and it was. The problem with animation these days, especially when it's coming from Asia is that it is extremely likely to receive high praise regardless of how good it actually is, and this makes it very difficult to decide whether or not certain films are worth seeing. While Vampire Hunter D definitely is worth seeing, I get the feeling that a lot of it's high praise is coming from the fact that Asian cinema is in vogue right now. The plot is classic vampire fodder, which is why it instantly appealed to me, and it follows the story of a young rich girl who is apparently kidnapped by a vampire. The vampire population is dwindling, thanks to the bounty hunters, and our story picks up when the girl's father hires a hunter - Vampire Hunter D - to find his daughter. He hires another crew as well, but they soon find out that the girl may have gone with the vampire of her own free will...One of the reasons why anime continually gets high ratings is because, unlike other types of animation, the adult orientation allows for more developed characters; and some of the characters and exchanges in this movie are truly spectacular considering that it's animated. Vampire Hunter D manages to enthral the viewer by way of action and emotion, both of which are extremely well done. The characters are much more complex than in most live action vampire films with the central half-human, half-vampire figure providing most of the intrigue. I didn't like the design of the vampire hunter much, but like the lone figures across cinema; D's presence is enough to ensure that all of his scenes are a highlight. The film's adult orientation allows it to be more gratuitous in it's action sequences than most animated films, and the vast majority of them are really well done. The real star of the show for me was the horror atmosphere, which serves the film really well. The animation helps Vampire Hunter D massively in that respect as the filmmaker's only limit is their imagination, which means that the atmosphere is allowed to be laid on more thickly than a lot of horror movies have means to do. On the whole, this is a very good film, and while I would have preferred live action; Vampire Hunter D shows that animation is an adequate base for a horror movie.

However, while it's true that Marvel first published the Blade, Vampire Hunter comic in 1973, and this was clearly an influence on this character, Vampire Hunter D first made it to the big screen in 1985 -- over ten years before it's predecessor got the Hollywood / Wesley Snipes treatment. And besides, this is actually a lot better.Great visuals, lots of blood, plenty of weirdness ... what more do you want in an anime? The first thing you'll notice is how great this movie looks. Compare this with the original, and it just goes to show how new technology is best put to use in animation. There are times when you want to pause the movie simply to marvel at how great a particular frame looks. And everything, the characters, the creatures, and the world itself, is brilliantly designed. This is the main advantage of animation, that you can design pretty much anything and have it realised without concern for cost. But this on it's own does not make a good film, of course ... it's helped along by an engaging storyline and interesting characters, resulting in an eastern Gothic masterpiece. The ending inparticular is notable for an anime since it focuses strongly on the characters rather than on some crazy monster design, which is the usual approach.There are those who would argue that this is among the greatest anime movies of all time, and it's certainly one of the very best that I've seen.

While it strayed a bit from the original story (Mashira wasn't some kind of werewolf, but rather a carbuncle that took form in people's stomachs, and Caroline was a dhampir that could control anything she drank from, whether its a tree or a machine) it's still a good story. I laughed a bit when they changed up Leila's relationship with the Markus brothers, as in the book, they are referred to as the Markus Clan, as Leila is their sister. This doesn't stop Kyle from making several lewd comments (fmi, read the book).One thing i didn't like, IIRC, they added Carmilla to the movie. She wasn't in the book, but, that's IIRC. And they didn't use D's pendant, although there was ample opportunity.This time around, though, they really hit home on how long D's been around, in the scene with the old man, and the end when he's at the funeral.

Im hoping they make more movies, as the books continue to get better and better, and are great reads, no matter how many times you've read them previously.

There have been many vampire movies over the ages, many which I've seen, and this probably stands atop my list. The animation is good, and the music is non existent where required, and light and sublime otherwise and that blended beautifully. The Dunpeal Hunter, or 'D', has an almost 'Man with no name' Clint Eastwood feel &#150; silent, mysterious, and exceptionally good at what he does. Every character has been given some thought, from Meir Link the Vampire, the Barbarroy creatures to the Marcus Brothers. All these characters stand out on their own, even the minions. The movie is not only stylish but innovative, and this makes it very enjoyable. The fight scenes are exemplary, the story well written and fast paced. Various weapons from crossbows, swords to guns make an appearance, all taking part in fascinating skirmishes. A definite watch, whether you are a fan of vampire movies or not.

A couple of weeks ago I bought it on DVD and couldn't stop telling myself that it is probably one of the best movies I've ever seen.First of all, the story. Although it's rather simple (The search for a kidnapped girl by bounty hunters) it is still well worked in various aspects such as amalgamating the classical vampire story with a post-Apocalyptic future, two plot lines very difficult to combine, yet it has been done in a marvelous way.Then the characters. Since it's an anime, the entire work of giving life to a character is entirely at the hands of the director and the artists, while a lesser weight is put by the dubbing cast. I am not trying to take credit from the dubbing cast since their work is very, very good (I can't stop laughing every time I hear the voice of the Old Barbaroi while the expression put into Leila's and Left Hand's voice is not even voice but PURE FEELING). As I said, the work done by the crew in everything that involved CHARACTER AND PSYCHOLOGICAL DEVELOPMENT is the best I've ever seen in any animes, sadly even better than the great Lupin III. By the end of the film you won't have any doubts on the characters and it will seem to you as if you've known them for your whole life.The animation....by far the best I've experienced. I cannot describe it with words, since nothing would make justice to it, but in case you have had the luck to see the film I'm sure that scenes such as the attack to the Barbarois by Grove and the SUPERB arrow sequence (This I believe to be the finest scene I've ever seen on an anime feature) of the graveyard have been stuck in your head since then.Again, the characters are extremely done. The idea of inserting Left Hand's character (Although the parasite has been there since the first Vampire Hunter D) is excellent since it gives someone the chance to say certain phrases (She's out of her mind!, The spirit of Carmilla!) without which lots of tension and action would be inevitably lost.And finally, the soundtrack. Mr D'Ambrosio with few simple notes has given a soundtrack to the anime like few I'd ever listened to before a march as the Markus Borther's theme, Carmilla's Theme (Regina della Notte) and a few trumpets to introduce the grandia of D to the public are few examples of the magnificiency of this composer, who, if he has the luck and keeps it up will become the next John Williams or Ennio Morricone.I suppose the best words that can describe this film are the ones by Derek Elley for Variety, who says ...a visual poetry that's refreshing.This film is in fact, pure poetry.

Western audiences, much of what gets made is overly cutesy-poo. Silly comic relief, wacky, saucer eyed characters with mouths that go from the size of a pencil eraser to the size of a pie tin whenever they get agitated, etc. (Think 'Fushigi Yugi'). Any trip to a place where they have a big selection of Anime DVDs will attest to this. One of the few oasis' of ultimate coolness in Anime has always been the films that come from the animation house 'Madhouse'. Ninja Scroll and Wicked City being the two best examples this. Films with characters that have cruel, angular features and packed with stunning, outrageous violent action.But the problem is that these types of films are few and far between. They are obviously not very popular in Japan (There was never even a real Ninja Scroll or Wicked City 2). American home video audiences made Ninja Scroll and Wicked City two of the most popular cult Anime films here in the states, granted, there ARE alot of American anime freaks that actually like the saucer eyed cutesy poo girly characters of more traditional Anime, but the desire for more of the ultra-super-mega cool Madhouse stuff was a thirst rarely slaked.In steps Vampire Hunter D Bloodlust.......This film is EXACTLY what American audiences have been craving for years. This is Madhouse at their finest. This anime is full of the exceptionally cool, wickedly designed characters and unbelievable, fast paced action of their previous masterworks (The aforementioned Ninja Scroll and Wicked City) but with fantastic, more technologically advanced animation work.Everything about the look and action in this film is absolute solid gold. I actually got a tingle up my spine during a few of the action scenes. These characters (Even the Humans) are all endowed with superhuman power, they fight each other with a wide array of gimmicky weapons and kill each other with heaps of gory goodness. My only complaints are that it got a bit sappy at points, and that D was much too obviously the 'hero' of the story. I say that because the bounty hunters in this film are EXTREMELY COOL. I liked the bounty hunters more than I like D. They were sooo very cool, and when they won a fight it actually seemed like an accomplishment (Unlike D, who is so powerful you just expect him to win every time he fights).The bottom line is this If you like anime like Ninja Scroll, and have always felt that more films of that type should have been made, then THIS FILM WAS MADE FOR YOU.

I sat glued to the screen till the very end. Since I just found out this was a sequel I will not write much since I have not seen the first part, however I might write a few pointers as to what you're about to experience if you let yourself get into this adventure, love story type of vampiristic action and in some parts comedy and drama.The Vampire Hunter D is a bounty hunter, by all means it means he kills for money. He is also half-human, half-vampire which gives him the power to walk outside during the day but it also means he has less strength than the real vampire right? Nope! Here he might be able to walk outside during the day but he is also as strong as the next full pledged vampire. After a rich man's daughter is kidnapped he is assigned for the mission along with another team whom he is competing against for the bounty money. Apparently a vampire has kidnapped the daughter and as for there, probably the last vampire left. There is no need to mention that the plot is only that skin deep, there is much more to it but then again you'd have to watch the movie to understand and see it cause I am not gonna be a movie pooper, so there. Along the lines of getting the money, there are beautiful fighting scenes, a lot of action and yes, as I said earlier, love involved. So please don't miss this movie, rent it, buy it, borrow it, but see it for it is a must see, a movie that you'll remember.

Though here, agony is music and death is a masterpiece, but some of the little children might not appreciate that (or appreciate a little too much ;-)). As for everyone else... enjoy the vicious dance.The setting is a mix of cyberpunk (see Ghost in the Shell, Akira) and Middle Ages mystics (see Vampire Hunter, Demon City, perhaps Vampire princess Miyu), but the styles do not clash, rather producing an engaging synthesis, unique imagery and feeling.Perhaps the weakest point is the plot - and that's only because it is good, while everything else is excellent. Personally I found it a tiny bit disappointing that an anime produced otherwise as a peak of artistry didn't rise too high above cliches. On the other hand, though it might not be as much a feast for the brain as the likes of Neon Genesis Evangelion or Serial Experiments Lain, it has certainly avoided confusing the viewers (a la Akira) while still maintaining a good storyline.The plot even manages to be unpredictable at times.(The following might be considered a SPOILER).The main figures of shaded fate are Meier Link, a powerful vampire and the most notable antagonist, and his human beloved (her name eludes me for the moment). Personally, I didn't know whether they'll survive until the very end. (END SPOILER).The ending seemed a bit rushed, though. But maybe it was just because I wanted to see more of this beautiful, amazing movie, which I highly recommend to everyone. Watch it in theatre for maximum effect, and get the DVD as soon as it hits the shelves.I can't even rate it - this movie is THE BEST.

Vampire Hunter D began his life as an early 80's sketch by Yoshito something or other (Sandman Endless Nights and Final Fantasy IIX & IX), and then became a film of the same title.  Then in the early nineties when Anime began to flourish as it had in the eighties talk began of resurrecting the sleeping immortal and the flame was passed to a quite capable team.  Bloodlust is D's quest to return a seemingly abducted woman to her rich family.  Complications begin to arise when the family also hire the Borghoff and his crew, a collection of vampire hunters with different and amazing abilities quite reminiscent of the mutants in the original.  As D quests to find the woman he begins to uncover a trail that may lead him directly into not only Barboroi, but even to the castle of Carmila - wife of Dracula  himself.  His path wrought with danger and demons of all sorts D must battle his way to saving the young woman, and he never fails at his job.... he can not fail or rest until he dies. Drawn beautiful and well dubbed I see very little to complain about here.  There is a little bit of mystery left to D's character, but not nearly as much as with the original title.  You learn a great deal more about D's life and his parents, not too mention he shows emotion once or twice in this one which is nice too see, no one's perfect except in paintings.  A little to computer assisted for my taste at some points, I love the art style that is used. It remains very true to the original feel.  Likewise they DON'T trample on the character that was originally set up rather they work with and expand it. 9 out of 10.

The first being that I really enjoy the characters. Especially the Barbarois Elder, Meier Link, Left hand, and of coarse D. Each character has a unique attitude and view on everything. And each character has a fresh and fascinating twist. Something that we should see more often in Anime. Another thing would be the era and all the stuff that comes along with that. Without saying it you could tell that the world went through a depression, and so they had to start from square-one. And from there came the mixture of the past with he future. We see this in costumes, technology, etc. For instance, mechanical horses. No evolved automobiles. A great look at what the future could be like. Unlike the recurring future ideas we see too often.

The romance between the main villain and the woman he loves isn't really explained or developed that well and at the end I don't understand why D thinks he will still get the reward if he just takes the ring, but those are the only flaws I can remember about this film. The visuals are absolutely gorgeous, so if nothing else about this film works for you your eyes will be entertained from beginning to end. The action is absolutely spectacular. The fights are two-sided, have great suspense, a variety of cool attack and weapons, and are just nice to look at. The characters all have some sort of morals and reason for doing what they do as well as having human flaws which makes all of them very interesting. There are also several great tear jerking moments and this film doesn't insult its audience by making sure all of the good guys get out alive. One common complaint I have heard is that in the original manga the vampire hunters kept the female vampire hunter as a sex slave, but I thought that was a good change because this would probably make them generic terrible people and I genuinely enjoy their characters in this movie. If this was the best film ever, which it isn't, I would be okay with that because it just does so many thing so perfectly.

It's a far-out universe full of weird-looking monsters (including vampires, of course, but also werewolves, some lady that turns into a tree, giant stingrays that fly over deserts, zombies, and other freaky creatures of the night). It's a world full of imaginative settings and locations, and of cool-looking weapons and technology. The whole thing is like what you get if Blade was cross-bred with Book of Eli, and it's awesome that way.Above all, the movie runs fast, loaded with great-looking action, fights, and great visuals. The film is never dull, it's never repetitive, and it's rarely clichÃ©d (not even by anime standards). I've always found it to be a perfect mix of style and excitement, the likes of which is pretty much on the same level (though not nearly as shockingly graphic) as Kawajiri's past work with The Ninja Scroll.Above all, I think this tale of Vampire Hunter D is pretty decent. The older film from 1985 is a little more intimate in a way, but Bloodlust broadens the scope and scale tremendously. It includes a pretty big cast of cool characters, some of which are not what they initially seem (the film's ending does a decent job of challenging the notion of good and evil in spite of this). It's a twisty and action-laden plot with bounty hunters and monsters galore; maybe nothing terribly deep, but it is a fun thrill ride, and I think it's really cool stuff.This film uses great-looking animation, with smooth and refined movements, well-detailed backgrounds, and some really neat light and shadow effects. Character designs are top-notch. Most everything else features good-looking designs too. Voice-acting (for both English and Japanese) is decent. The music score is okay, but has some strong moments too.Vampire Hunter D Bloodlust is still one of the coolest and funnest anime films I've seen, and should be a must-see for fans of the medium.5/5 (Entertainment Perfect | Story Very Good | Film Very Good) "},{"Title":"My favorite animated film.","Date":"5 August 2012","Score":"","Genre":"Animation, Action, Adventure","Review":" Yoshiaki Kawajiri is one of those directors that I marvel at.

One hunter is especially feared, a dunpeal half breed both Vampire and Human yet something much more. His name is D. As our story opens, a powerful vampire lord named Meier Link kidnaps Charlotte, the daughter of a wealthy family and Vampire Hunter D is hired to get her back. This time however, he's got some serious competition in the form of The Marcus Brothers, a team of cybernetic enhanced vampire hunters who are determined to get the bounty even if it means taking out the competition. But as D learns more about his quarry and his competitors, he starts to see that things might be much more than they seem.Based on the 3rd book of in the Vampire Hunter D novel series Demon Deathchase, Vampire Hunter D Bloodlust(which is the 2nd Vampire Hunter D anime film following the 1985 Vampire Hunter D movie), is a beautifully piece of work. Through the magic of animation, the world as envisioned by novelist Hideyuki Kikuchi, with its foreboding castle spires, post-apocalyptic deserts, hauntingly dark jungles and rundown villages, is given form. With Yoshiaki Kawajiri, the master Director behind Ninja Scroll and Highlander The Search for Vengeance, at the helm, this anime film establishes a new benchmark of excellence in terms of both animation and art. From the opening scene all the way to the end credits, this movie captivates with its stunning visuals. Everything from the realistic looking backgrounds to the attractive character designs is vividly and painstakingly detailed with heavy blacks and rich shadows lending to a dark Gothic feel for the whole movie. Madhouse has pulled out all the stops with the animation, giving a fluidity the likes of which is rare among Japanese anime and a high frame-rate movements to the characters on screen despite the great amount of detail per frame. At no point in the entire movie are there any visible money-saving short cuts so common in most anime.The story presented in Vampire Hunter D Bloodlust is straight forward and easy to understand, more an action thriller chase movie with romance than a horror movie, going from intense fight sequences to the more subdued character centered moments seamlessly and without losing its sense of pace.It is weird however that in a movie titled Vampire Hunter D, its eponymous character, D, is easily the most uninteresting of the main cast. We do get some insights into his inner struggle with regard to killing his own vampiric kin and the forsaking of his own happiness to lead the lonely life of an immortal Hunter, but that is about it. Meier Link and Charlotte's character arc comes across as a little clichÃ© (see Romeo and Juliet/ forbidden love) but I do appreciate the twist which lent a whole new emotional level to the powerful vampire prince stereotype. Even the Marcus Brothers (who are actually 4 brothers and 1 sister) are not your typical Kawajiri wise-cracking band of freaks to fight the main character(see Ninja scroll for an example of what I mean). They are portrayed as very human with a strong sense of loyalty and care toward each other, a stark contrast to the distant and stoic D, despite their numerous cybernetic enhancements. This is actually a big change from how they were portrayed in the original novel (in the novel, the Marcus brothers were cold blooded sadistic degenerates who had an incestuous relationship with their sister), and in my opinion, it is a change for the better.Add in some great acting (I applaud the decision to have this movie's primary language in English as the setting and the characters have western names and appearances.), on par with even live action movies, and a script that even manages to throw in some well placed witty humor(usually in the form of D's talking left hand) without affecting the grim atmosphere of the show, and you have one of the most enjoyable animated movies of its genre. Vampire Hunter D Bloodlust delivers the goods and would exceed any expectations one would have from a movie of the horror/action genre. An excellent blend of action, violence and science fiction with well developed characters, awesome animation and a strong plot. A definite must have for the animated movie enthusiast, Vampire Hunter D Bloodlust has all the makings of a true classic.

My initial reaction to this film was that it was boring, disappointing, and clichÃ©d, and I just didn't like it one bit. So I just hid the DVD in a secluded corner because one look at the cover made me remember that I'd wasted money and a little over an hour of my time for something that failed to entertain me.Nearly two years later, I had a sudden urge to watch the film again. Strangely enough, I really liked it this time. I don't know what had changed, but my opinion of it isn't as harsh as it originally was anymore. I guess I just learned to appreciate things I'd overlooked the firs time I watched it. Or maybe it just took some time for it to grow on me.So, anyways, this movie is based on Hideyuki Kikuchi's series of novels about a brooding half-vampire, half-human vampire hunter known simply as D. Set in a time thousands of years ahead in the future, the lonely rider D hunts down creatures of the underworld for a fee in a world once ruled by a race of elite vampires, who have originally overthrown humans after a nuclear war swept the earth but are now falling into extinction, thanks to merciless hunters such as D himself. The plot isn't hugely original. In fact, it's nothing anyone familiar with half-decent modern vampire fiction hasn't already heard a hundred times. The deadpan D - and a rivaling group of tough vampire hunters - is hired to chase down a powerful vampire by the name of Meier Link, who has kidnapped a human girl called Charlotte. Halfway through the hunt, however, D begins to suspect that the girl has ran away with the vampire out of her own free will, though this doesn't stop D from carrying on with his mission. Enter sword-clanging, gore, big-busted anime babes, monsters, and endless musings about the existential anxiety of being a blood-lusting vampire.Though I quite enjoyed this film on the second viewing, the plot still failed to impress me. However, the charm of this movie isn't in the plot, but in the exquisite animation, and in the mythology of this movie. If anyone ever said that combining Western, Gothic horror, Science Fiction and Fantasy was impossible... well, they were wrong. Not only does Vampire Hunter D bring all this sub-genres of pulp fiction together in a convincing manner, it also manages to do it entirely without the aid of parody or self-irony. That's a real achievement, and I failed to appreciate it on the first viewing.I think there is a lot of potential in the whole concept of Vampire Hunter D, though the plot of this particular film is overdone. I gave it quite high a rating mainly because of its visual merits. However, of they ever decide to do another as beautifully animated film based on the series, I'd be sure to check it out.

I should know, I nearly fell asleep several times while struggling not to turn off the DVD player.  D is just as boring and uninteresting as he was in the previous movie.  Great anime does not a good movie make.  THe entire movie was arranged so that the producers would hope that the fantastic animation (or lack thereof) would distract from the lame storyline, and overused plot of a vampire falling in love with a human (like Dracula, for instance).  And an extreme disappointment that Lefthand, the only interesting character from the first movie, is now as dull as the person he is attached to.The only good thing about this movie is that I borrowed this movie from a friend of mine...I didn't waste a single dime.

The previews for this thing looked fantastic, sort of a goth version of Ninja Scroll.  The problem is that the movie itself just doesn't measure up.  The storyline is anime-mainstream garbage on the level of Pet Shop of Horrors or Sin, and while the fight scenes are alright, they just come across as watered-down Ninja Scroll.  America got the added bonus of one of the worst English-language dubs this side of Ghost in the Shell, and the DVD doesn't have language options.

I was told that I didn't need to watch the first film to understand this one, and I found that to be true enough.  But this didn't even come close to living up to the hype.SPOILERS!!!!!Great animation involves more than watching some hair blow in the ever-present wind.  Great acting is complimented by close-ups; still drawings of faces (with the few strands of hair blowing, of course) is not the same as watching an actor's face.  The climactic battle involves still shots of our hero and nemesis facing each other, a sword locked against a cape/shield.  They stare at each other and eventually where they touch begins to glow red.  Ooooooh, really great action scene.  In fact, most of the action scenes weren't much more than a still shot of our hero holding his sword while he is suspended in the air.  One swipe was usually enough to kill anything he faced.Also, I don't get this goth thing about Vampires being misunderstood, persecuted, blah blah blah.  Vampires kill humans in order to survive, right? End of story; no negotiating.  It's not like we walk around saying man, those homicidal maniacs have a bad rap!  Maybe we could just treat them like everyone else and all live in peace...  No.The movie is set in the far future, where there are bridges that apparently span hundreds of miles, yet the fastest thing on the road is a carriage drawn by four horses.  Our hero uses a sword, not a gun. WTF?And I can't say enough about how annoying it is to have a disembodied voice (in this case, coming from a demon-thingy face in our hero's palm) give advice and offer humourous commentary.  Lame.  Stupid.The good thing was the art itself.  The drawings are excellent.  The backgrounds, particularly, were a constant bright spot, done in a stunning neo-realistic style.  The character art is good, although I could was surprised to find that our hero is male.  From the art, I thought we had a female vampire hunter, and I found that I never could quite reconcile the hero's voice (masculine) with his decidedly feminine look.The story is filled with elements of Romeo & Juliet (tragic star-crossed lovers), racism (vampires are just misunderstood), and is at least coherent enough that it seems to make sense (as long as you don't think too hard about it (if his rivals wanted our hero dead & out of the way, why destroy the mob about to attack him, eh? but like i said, don't think too hard about it)).To sum up, if you think that lots of still art (i mean that little if anything in the frame is in motion), like watching each frame of a comic book, is how an animated feature should be, and yer really into goth-y/sci-fi stuff, you'll love this movie.  If you want people who move, scenery that does more than move from a perspective, and a story that doesn't throw a lot of trite misunderstood monster/Romeo & Juliet/racism crap at you, you might want to keep looking.Oh yeah, it does have a happy ending, tho.Snowboarder Bo Snoarder "},{"Title":"Disappointing at Best","Date":"8 October 2003","Score":"4 out of 9 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Animation, Action, Adventure","Review":"  A lot of people really like this film, and, no offense to them, but I can only conclude they haven't seen much in the way of vampire films, or TV shows, or anime, or books . . . .  And they probably haven't seen the marginal but better 1985 original Vampire Hunter D.Bloodlust has some very nice art, especially the backgrounds, and a few cute ideas.  Unfortunately, it's drowning in exhausted cliches, poor character design, cutesy and unsatisfying action scenes, and unbearably awful dialogue.  What's worse is that it's the unoriginal elements that get the most emphasis and most airtime.The English-language version actually came first . . . which makes the extreme poorness of that version's dialogue peculiar.  Characters repeat themselves, over-explain, belabor the obvious, and generally wax stupid. Normally, you could blame this on a lazy or rushed dubber trying to make the English track match the Japanese original.  Here, it's just inexcusable. I've seen both the English and Japanese versions, and the dialogue is bad in both.But the thing that really hurts my teeth is the way they keep saying dunpeal.  No such thing -- the word is dhampyre, pronounced like vampire is supposed to be pronounced (rhymes with romp here).  It's a real word, not made up for the anime -- a Romany word meaning the son of a woman impregnated by a vampire (usually her former husband).  Dhampyres are, indeed, usually vampire hunters in Gypsy legends.The word was obviously transliterated into Japanese (daampiru, or something like that) . . . and then an English translator who didn't know much about vampires and didn't do any research re-transliterated it as dunpeal.  Ugh.  The word comes up a lot in the script, and they might as well have said vunpeal for vampire.Still, this is a film that appeals to an audience that isn't familiar with the material the film draws on . . . so not many fans will notice.  But the film is dull, dumb, overlong, and rarely makes much sense.  The lack of continuity alone is a big handicap, but there's so much else wrong with the movie that I can't give it a passing grade.

Overall it isn't much to my taste. The imagination strikes me as arbitrary and shapeless, one minute we are in a hillside nature fighting zombies, the next in a desert with giant mantas flying out of the sand. I get more enjoyment from inhabiting an internally shaped world. Bladerunner instead of Dune.It has no limits to its fantasy, literally anything happens, and yet very simple limits to its story forbidden love and revenge both tied to damnation. A Byronic antihero with a sword is our navigator. I find that it takes more work and more imagination in trying to envision ambiguous story limits, showing how this world is otherworldly and eerily cosmic. Mulholland Dr. instead of L'Ange.What's interesting is that the villains here embody all the structural elements missing from the actual fabric of the film. One of them can move in shadows, weaves illusions out of fabric and is himself that fabric of nothingness; in a marvelous scene he traps our hero inside an actual fabric. Another can take apparently any structure. A third creates illusions out of peoples' memory, and is also herself a spectral entity made up from illusion.So we have an unfathomable world where unfathomable beings embody extreme structural powers, a strange thing that ever so slightly charms.

I miss the music though - the original had some really nice music to add to the atmosphere of the bizarre futuristic vampire land...Stay away from the dubbed version!

D himself is a halfling half man half vampire he can live in the daylight, but not for too long or else he will break down completely. His bloodlust is also better controlled than that of 100% vampires. His character is brought to life very well in the movie, as well as the characters of a competing vampire-hunter gang.The main element of the story is about love between the abducting vampire and the girl Charlotte. Charlotte says she loves him, which contradicts the abduction-part of the story. They want to get out (both) to the Night City, where it is always dark. This is where it gets to the second part of the story a castle owned by Barbarois, a vicious vampire that uses deception as a powerful weapon. In that castle some sort of spaceship is located with which they are able to leave in the end, leaving D and Leia (one of the competing group's members) behind.As far as flow, storytelling and animation go, it's OK, up to good in some scenes. But still something is lacking with this potential theme. Not the best in the world, but definitely not the worst.As a comparison, the motion picture Blade which contains the same half vampire half human theme, is much more about action and violence in Vampire Hunter D, there is a lot more story(telling) and background, as well as a lot of symbolism.Worth a look if you like anime, vampire-storytelling and a bit of violence.
