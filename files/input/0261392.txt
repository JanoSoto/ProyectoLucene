A fitting conclusion to his New Jersey Trilogy (that now consists of five films instead of the originally planned three) forgoes the serious religious overtones of Dogma and the Sexuality issues brought forth in Chasing Amy to go for pure Laughs...............and it succeeds.The film's main plot revolves around the familiar duo of Jay (Jason Mewes) and his Heterosexual Life mate Silent Bob and their attempts to thwart a movie based on a comic book about Jay and Bob.  It's essentially a road picture as the guys make their way from Leonardo, New Jersey to Hollywood. Along the way they meet international Jewel Thieves, Steal a Monkey,  Meet The Scooby Doo gang,  Try and Beat up Ben Affleck and Matt Damon, and much more.As Silly as all this sounds it's done in such a way that's smart, witty, and still has a touch of class about it.  And that's pretty hard to do considering I can't even tell you some of the content of the movie without being censored heavily.If you are at all familiar with Smith's movies (Clerks, Mallrats, Chasing Amy, and Dogma) you will get a kick out of the countless cameos and connections to his other films.  For Example, Jason Lee reprises two roles (one from Mallrats and one from Chasing Amy) as does Ben Affleck.  Matt Damon appears as himself playing Will Hunting in a fictitious sequel to Good Will Hunting entitled `Good Will Hunting II Hunting Season. There are two highlights of this movie that I need to talk about.  First Being Jason Mewes as Jay.  This guy is for real, by far and away he has put in the best performance of all his five film appearances  as Jay  He carries the picture and is side splittingly funny.  It is my hope that he can now get other roles in movies besides the loveable Dope smoking Jay. Secondly I want to address Kevin Smith's Directing.  To all the people who say Smith can't direct need to see Jay and Silent Bob. His use of motion should silence everyone who claims there are no moving shots in a Smith film!!!  It's almost become fashionable to blast Smiths direction because that's the Thing to do. With all the great action and movement in Jay and Silent Bob'  Smith can finally shrug off all the criticisms of the past.What can I say to sum up? It's a brilliant movie for everyone, not just Smith fans. You will laugh and laugh some more. Do yourself a favour and go see it as soon as you can!

I, for one, think the guy is a genius.  If you don't mind my lauding his name, read on. First, a little background for the uninitiated.Kevin Smith's movies (Clerks, Mallrats, Chasing Amy, Dogma, and now JSBSB) are a world created by the director himself, in the sense that all are interconnected by characters, plot points, and subtle references. The one constant, though, is the entity known as Jay and Silent Bob, a pair of pot dealers who have more or less spent their entire lives standing in front of the Quik-Stop convenience store.  Jay (Jason Mewes) is the long-haired guy we all knew in high school, his endless stream of four-letter epithets almost endearing because the goofy guy just doesn't know any better.  Silent Bob (played by director Kevin Smith), Jay's self-described `hetero life-mate' stands by without speaking a word and provides some sort of moral counterpoint for the duo. In Smith's `Chasing Amy,' Banky and Holden (Jason Lee and Ben Affleck, respectively) created a comic book entitled `Bluntman and Chronic,' based on their real-life buddies Jay and Silent Bob.  Fast-forward to `Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back.'Banky has sold the rights to his comic to Miramax pictures, leaving Jay and Silent Bob in the dark about the business deal.  Jay and Bob, with help from Holden, discover via the Internet (`What's the Internet?' asks Jay) that a movie based on them is about to start production. Realizing that they won't see a dime of the money, and even more upset by their defamation on Internet message boards, they decide to truck across the country to stop the film from being produced.It's important to note that while the comedy is crude, slapstick, and even resorts to fart jokes, it's not dumb comedy, it's satire at it's finest, reminiscent of such self-deprecating masterpieces as `Pee-Wee's Big Adventure' and `Blazing Saddles.' After the fairly serious `Chasing Amy' and the spiritually overtoned `Dogma,' we see that Smith has decided to get together with his buddies and put together one big inside joke. Fortunately, he's decided to let a few of us in on it.  The viewer's enjoyment of the movie is going to depend completely on his or her knowledge of Smith's previous films and characters. Smith's friends show up in cameos, from Chris Rock to Will Ferrell to Alanis Morrissette to Carrie Fisher to Mark Hamill (Smith is an infamous Star Wars fanatic). You can literally see a man's childhood dream coming true when at one point, Smith's Bob gets to carry on a lightsaber duel with Hamill.Local interest In one of the many subplots, a group of female jewel thieves bring Jay and Silent Bob to our very own Boulder, Colorado, to steal a monkey from a medical testing facility. `Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back' is a comedy, and doesn't try to be anything else.  The only thing I felt was missing was one of Jason Lee's  inspired monologues bitterly bemoaning the state of society.  Some of Shannon Elizabeth's screen time could have been cut, I felt, in favor of some trademark Smith dialogue.Smith now intends to focus his time on more dramatic pursuits, and we are given this as the fifth and last film in his so-called `Jersey Trilogy.' The bottom line is, Smith loves his fans, and this film was created for the loyal.  A fitting send-off for Jay and Silent Bob, this film gets an `A-.'

He couldn't have come up with a better send-off for them. True, there's no big ideas behind this film like there were in Dogma or Chasing Amy, but really, the grand ideas in those movies came from the main characters, not Jay and Silent Bob. They were there for comic relief mainly. Therefore, it makes sense that Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back would be pure slapstick comedy. Think about it, do you really want a foul-mouthed, over-sexed stoner telling you how to live your life?So anyway, it's a pure slapstick humor road movie. But unlike most slapstick comedies of late, this one's actually funny...extremely funny. Jay and Silent Bob find out that a movie is being made from a comic book (Bluntman & Chronic) that was based on them. They set off for Hollywood intending to stop it. Kevin Smith manages to pack so many jokes into what could have been another predictable, boring road comedy, that it's head and shoulders above the competition. I'm gonna have to go see it again, to make sure I didn't miss any jokes. Smith once again is showing off his incredible writing skills. Some people may not believe that any movie full of crude, R-rated humor is well written, but it is. Not only is it incredibly funny, but there's an intelligence and wit behind it that is unmistakably Kevin Smith's.I was also pleased with the quality of acting in the movie, especially Jason Mewes (Jay). In past View Askew movies, Mewes has been funny, despite not doing a particularly good job of acting. The one thing I was worried about was whether or not he'd be able to carry a film mostly by himself (since Silent Bob is mostly, well, silent). But he definitely proved that he has grown enough as an actor to be able to head up a movie. Kevin Smith (Silent Bob) does his usual decent job. Since he doesn't say much, mainly just reacts, he can't to a great job, but he's still very funny. He's the perfect companion (or should I say, hetero life mate for Jay, who's the complete opposite. There are no real other big parts in the movie, but there are tons of little cameos. Really, I think it'd be easier to list the people who DON'T appear in it. Some of the highlights include a scene with Ben Affleck and Matt Damon playing themselves, on the set of Good Will Hunting 2 Hunting Season, a scene with Jason Biggs and James Van Der Beek, as themselves, playing the stars of the Bluntman and Chronic movie, and a scene with Mark Hamill parodying Star Wars. But really, almost all of the jokes are highlights.For people who have seen the other films in Smith's New Jersey Chronicles series (Clerks, Mallrats, Chasing Amy, & Dogma), there are quite a few in-jokes that you will find hilarious. In addition to playing himself, Affleck also reprises his role as Holden from Chasing Amy, Jason Lee reprises his roles from Chasing Amy and Mallrats, and Jeff Anderson and Brian O'Halloran reprise their Clerks roles. Many others from the View Askewniverse appear as well. However, this movie is not only for fanboys. I saw it with a friend who hadn't seen any of the other four movies, and he thought it was hilarious too. The majority of the jokes will be understood by anyone. The in-jokes are like a little bonus from Smith to his fans, but they are not the focus of the movie.Kevin Smith also does a good job directing. Lately, it seems to have become popular to attack Smith's directing ability, but I think he did a good job. In his earlier movies, his directing was simply decent, not good, not bad. But he has made a lot of progress. This is one of the better directed comedies I've seen. Not Academy Award stuff, but most other comedy directors are pretty boring it seems.I want to briefly comment on the GLAAD protests of the film, citing large amounts of homophobia. I am gay, and I didn't find the film offensive. I think a lot of people are just taking the film way to seriously. It's not a serious film. People forget that Jay is, basically, a moron, so you can exactly take everything he says as the truth. Smith has said it's supposed to be a satire, and it works. Especially considering that in past films, Jay has admitted to sometimes fantasizing about guys. It's a satire, lighten up people. There's actually a funny scene where James Van Der Beek chastises Jason Biggs for calling something gay, and also there's a funny disclaimer at the end.Which reminds me, stay for the credits. There's plenty of funny stuff, and Alanis Morissette shows up at the very end. All in all, Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back is an extremely funny movie, plain and simple. Just don't take it seriously, because again, it's not a serious movie. There's still a few months to go, but I think this will prove to be the funniest movie of the year...actually, of the last many years.

I say this because it is the only movie I have ever laughed out loud at in a theater. I know a lot of people complain because the movie is toilet humor, vulgar language, and sex jokes. But so what? Kevin Smith took on serious topics before, this is his chance to kick back. If you go into this movie expecting to be enlightened, then there is something seriously wrong with you.In the film, Jay and Silent Bob discover that Miramax will be making a movie based on Bluntman & Chronic, the comic based on themselves. Soon after discovering the insults people are slinging about the movie on the internet, Jay and Silent Bob head to Hollywood to shut the movie down and protect their good names. This movie ties together all of Smith's other Jersey crew films, with appearances by characters from Clerks through Chasing Amy.While it is true that you won't get all the jokes unless you've seen Smith's other movies, that won't stop a person from enjoying it if they haven't. When I first saw Jay & Silent Bob Strikes Back in theaters, I had only seen Dogma beforehand and I thought it was hilarious. Everyone in this movie puts on an awesome comedic performance, though I think my favorite comes from Will Ferrell as an inept wildlife marshal. If you don't mind some distasteful humor, you've got to see this movie.

In past films, Kevin Smith seemed to have a limited appeal, mostly among arm-chair directors (such as myself)who had become jaded with the Hollywood film industry, but with his slap-stick-like middle finger to the movie industry he seems to have branched out and struck a note with the MTV audience (10 to 16 year olds).  Smith's grade-school humor, delivered mostly by Jay, is nothing new to previous movies, but with  the focus on Jay & Silent Bob this humor became more evident AND more inviting to a younger audience.Nonetheless, Smith has not alienated his core audience who are, ...over and underweight guys who can't get laid. (See Holden McNeil in Chasing Amy). The simple visual affects, as in his past movies, are FAR  overshadowed by the fantastic dialogue he writes which has Hollywood stars chomping at the bit to deliver.  If anything, the only disappointment was a  very thin plot (OK, Mallrats Had a plot, no one ever said it was a good one).  But as he did in Mallrats, for what J.S.B.S.B. is lacking in plot, Smith sure as hell made up for it in laughs.This movie junkie gives Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back a 9 out of 10.. .let's just hope what Chris Rock says in the movie doesn't come true.

When the get a restraining order, they find out that the comic starring their likenesses Bluntman and Chronic is being turned into a Miramax movie. However, they aren't being paid for it, so what to do? Travel cross-country to Hollywood from New Jersey to stop the movie from getting made, what else?Crude, inappropriate, and extremely funny. If there's ever a movie that you should watch with your drinking friends and not with a date or family, this is the one! It has jokes about genetalia, bodily functions, innuendoes, and more, and I haven't laughed this hard at a movie for a long time. Call me immature, but I like this type of stuff, ones that actually have substance behind the crude jokes (not like Old School).Mewes was f-ing hilarious, when he f-ing say the f-ing f-word every f-ing word. It has over 230 f-words along in this movie, with the total number of curses probably around 300. I have never heard so many, but I laughed. I'm not ashamed to admit it Mewes cracked me up, with his stylish arrogance and foul mouth. Smith, who was laconic for almost the entire film, expressed everything with his eyes, which were funny. There were more cameos than a movie of The Simpsons, with Ben Affleck, Matt Damon, George Carlin, Jamie Kennedy, Chris Rock, Tracy Morgan, Joey Lauren Adams, and many, many more.There were many pot-shots of American movies. For instance, when Jay and Silent Bob meet a drug dealer played by Tracy Morgan, he says that Miramax accounts for about 75% of his income. Also, everyone on-screen looks at the camera when they mention, `No one would pay to see a Jay and Silent Bob movie,' and when Ben Affleck says that one reason you do a picture is because you owe a friend a favor. As the Bluntman and Chronic movies premieres, someone says, `Well, it was better than Mallrats.'Are you easily offended? Does the mention of various body parts upset you? If you answered yes to either question, Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back is not your movie. If you answered no, sit back and enjoy the ride!My rating 7/10Rated R for nonstop crude and sexual humor, pervasive strong language, and drug content.

Whether ambitious thematically, (Dogma, Chasing Amy), or outright comedy, (Mallrats), the movies as a whole were less satisfactory than their many very funny parts. The sporadic appearances of the second string character duo of Jay and Silent Bob were always a welcome event.The big question was whether this 2001 styled Laurel and Hardy, when promoted to center stage, could carry a movie. The answer much to my surprise was a resounding yes. Smith outdoes himself, producing an exceptional comedy. It's consistently inventive, with surprises, in jokes and many cameos from Smith regulars, all who seem to be genuinely having a ball. Never has irreverence and bad language been done with so much charm.Those who disliked Smith's previous works would do well to stay away, they are unlikely to be converted. But for fans, Smith really does deliver the goods, in a big way.I was totally baffled by reading that certain gay groups took offence to this movie. It would seem to me a total misreading as well as a great deficiency in the humor department. Apart from the fact that Smith lampoons all and sundry, it actually struck me as a particularly gay friendly movie. The fact that a gay character sums the movie up as one big gay joke should be taken as a compliment more than anything else.It's clear that this brings Smith's cycle to a close. He couldn't have wished for a better ending.

This movie is especially weak considering that it followed CHASING AMY and DOGMA--2 of the best (and funniest) American films of the past five years.If this flick was something that Kevin Smith just had to get out of his system, then I'm willing to forgive him.  I think he's got a lot more to offer than fart and stoner jokes.  There's little proof of that in this film, though.  If you're a Smith fan, you can wait for this movie to hit the discount theatres (or video).  If you haven't seen any previous KS films, by all means skip J & SB SB.

Maybe I'm just getting older but swearing, gay jokes and farting just kind of get old after 3-4 films, you know? At least the series is finally over and we'll see if Smith has any talent or not. Judging from this fluff I have extreme doubt.What ever happened to the clever sharp dialogue? That's all his film's had before. None of them (sans Chasing Amy) had any plot but were full of juicy monologues and one-liners, not to mention plenty of satire and on-target observations of our society.

Gone is the biting wit and odd charm of that film, and in its place, big-budget pointlessness and a dozen more dick jokes. The many cameo appearances of characters from the other movies which comprise the extended 'New Jersey Trilogy' (Clerks, Mallrats, Chasing Amy and the woeful Dogma) serve only to remind the viewer just how good - or even average - Smith used to be. Indeed, whatever it was that made his work so individual and enjoyable was clearly lost some time ago.Directorially, the 'post-modern' elements (several actors playing dual roles) are fairly well-handled, though presumably quite confusing for those who haven't seen earlier entries in the series. Unfortunately, however, Smith's usual lack of visual awareness and style is once more in evidence. In Clerks it didn't matter the script was so tight that the primitive direction was irrelevant, but here, with hardly any gags hitting the mark (special mention for Mark Hamill's spectacularly unfunny cameo) it's extremely noticeable.The acting too, is of a poor standard with too many lines and jokes fluffed, though Jason Mewes' usual one-note performance (essentially playing a toned-down version of himself, by all accounts) works well here. All in all, more puerile and less funny than its predecessors, though foul-mouthed children, stoners and idiots may take to it more than most. "},{"Title":"Hollywood had it coming?

I even loved Mallrats, which was heavily criticized. The movie started off on a pretty good note, the Scooby sequence ranks with the best Smith moments, but that's exactly what this movie is an all around crappy film with some good, even memorable scenes injected every now and then.I think the main reason this movie failed was that it was EXTREMELY pretentious. I've never met Smith and I've only seen a few interviews. I love the guy as a filmmaker and NO ONE loves Clerks, Mallrats, Chasing Amy or Dogma more than me. I connected with those four films big time. But with THIS film, it's as if the fame has gone to View Askew's head. There's a sort of we're so cool feel to a lot of the characters, but none more so than Silent Bob. When SB started shouting in Jay's face, I cringed and sank in my seat because it was SUPPOSED to be funny and it was supposed to make us think, Wow, Silent Bob is not only talking, but he's also shouting. But instead, I just thought to myself, Oh, come ON! I'm no mindreader, but I definitely sensed that the film was done with an underlying, albeit probably unintentional arrogance about it.I heard this was going to be the last of the Jay & Silent Bob series. I was bummed about that until I saw this. This fragmented film, although it's supposed to be silly, proves that the Jay & Silent Bob series was running on fumes. It was as if Smith ran out of things to do or say. Mind you, I'm not saying it should've had a serious message. There wasn't a really dramatic message in Mallrats, yet I loved it. Jay & Silent Bob Strike Back is not a total crap film, but it's definitely the one and only View Askew film I was really disappointed with, and I think the film's pretentiousness has a lot to do with why it failed.

Now in 2001, Kevin Smith devotes ninety-five minutes of film to himself. Any negative reviews you may read are surely written by critics who weren't big fans of Smith's previous efforts (especially Mallrats). J&SBSB is a movie for the View Askew fans. The film contains many references to Clerks (1994), Mallrats (1995), Chasing Amy (1997), and Dogma (1999) as well as the Clerks comic books and the Jay and Silent Bob comic book, Chasing Dogma, that bridges the gap between Chasing Amy and Dogma (actually, a great deal of the film's road trip comes directly from this book).J&SBSB (the fifth film in the New Jersey Trilogy, much like The Hitchhiker's Guide five-part trilogy) is filled to the brim with crude humor that usually turns off most movie critics, but it's crude humor with Kevin Smith's familiar wit. It's written for Jason Mewes to really shine in his performance (I never thought I'd say that).The major part of this film that stood out for me is the craft. The craft?! What the hell could I be talking about? As many know, Kevin Smith's movies are notorious for having almost zero camera moves. This is Kevin Smith's most technically superior film (probably because it's his highest budget). There are camera moves and excellent camera angles. In Smith's last film, Dogma, as well as this one, he utilizes the 2.351 aspect ratio. Why in the world he feels that he needs to use such scope in these films is beyond me.Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back is not a real movie. Chasing Amy is the closest Smith has come to that. For the View Askew/Kevin Smith fans, this is his best film. It will certainly be interesting to see what kind of movies Smith decides to make now that his New Jersey Trilogy has come to a close and he doesn't have the familiar characters to fall back on.

I thought clerks and chasing amy were great movies from a brilliant director.  Superb acting, great jokes, and great characters.Unfortunately, his newest movie, Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back, has none of those things.  First of all, let me point out that these characters are not the same Jay and Silent Bob many of you will remember from Clerks.  They were annoying, drug-dealing losers who played a small role in the movie.  Somewhere along the way, however, they became lovable goons that are the center of a movie.  I'm not sure these characters are well developed enough to be the main characters.Anyways, on to the movie.  This movie starts out SLLLOOOOWWWWW...It was too bad that they bring back lots of great characters like Randall, Dante, and Brody, but only for quick cameo shots.  None of them offer anything to this movie.  It takes a while, but finally the jokes start rolling.  Sadly, Kevin Smith kind of gave in to the American Pie movie style, which is just making lewd comments and sexual jokes.  There is no intelligent, insightful dialogue, as you are used to from his other movies.I think that the one bright spot of the movie was Chris Rock's character.  He displays the charm and wittiness that you have come to know from characters like Banky, Randall, Hooper X, etc.Overall, i would give this movie 4 stars out of 10.  There are some funny spots, but they do not really start until about halfway through the movie.

His acting is a series of silly gesture and mimic expression that remind me of a Disney movie. I liked Jay and Silent Bob in all of Smith's movies, because they were  so different from any other character. Most importantly Smith didn't overdo it, they only appeared for a few minutes. This time, Kevin Smith tries to build a whole movie around them, and it just doesn't work. Silent Bob's refusal to speak is hilarious if his appearance is limited, but having to see a lead role make an idiot out of himself makes you mad. At the end I really wanted to smack this guy up. Jason Mewes is way better, but his character is also too shallow for a lead role. The other known characters only give cameo appearances of about 30 seconds to two minutes. I had really looked forward to seeing Hooper, Alyssa and especially Dante and Randal again, so seeing them limited to a scene or two was a big disappointment.But what really sucked the most about this movie was that there was absolutely no intelligence in the dialogues. Dogma was at least intelligent, but it was boring. This movie is a series of dumb events tied together by obscenities, yes I know, there's been a lot of them in Smith's previous movies (particularly in `Clerks'), but there was always an intelligent story that justified them. `Jay and Silent Bob strike back' has no story at all, at least nothing you should call a story. In fact, this `story' is so bad, I assume he had an 8-year-old write it for him. As a replacement for a proper story he comes up with many references to other movies (`Planet of the Apes' being the best of them), but they are just nice, I expect a lot more from Smith. So after I've seen this movie I have to say that Kevin Smith is clearly on the way down. I loved all his movies until Dogma, but it seems as if he's lost all of his creativity since he got more money. The bigger the budget the worse the movie.After all that bashing I have to admit that there were a few bright spots even in this flick 1)Shannon Elizabeth is simply gorgeous, even with glasses ... 1 point2)Eliza Dushku is just ...wow ... 1 point3)Jeff Anderson is fantastic (why didn't he get more than 2 minutes ???) ... 1 point4)The orang-utan is cute ... 1 point5)At least it's not as boring as Dogma ... 1 pointUnfortunately that's about it.Dear reader, if you want to see Kevin Smith's best movie, go and get `Clerks', if you don't like independent movies, get `Chasing Amy', but please stay away from this one. I only recommend this if you get to see it for free (just so you can witness a pure genius hit rock bottom).Please don't waste any money on it.5/10  "},{"Title":"After watching this last night, it is not that good","Date":"5 September 2013","Score":"2 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy","Review":" So here I am looking at a comedy that I liked when I was 13 and 14.

The leading characters are a big problem, why? they work as side characters for the movies but in here... It doesn't work. Jay has potential to be a funny side character but not as a lead. He is on the verge of irritating as he chews the scenery of this movie. I did laugh at a few jokes, don't get me wrong but for every 1 joke that works there are about 5 more that fall flat. When a joke falls flat in this movie it falls REALLY FLAT.Not to mention they overuse the F word. I know, I might come across as an idiot for complaining about bad language in a Kevin Smith movie and it might be as stupid as complaining about the use of Amber in a Guillermo Del Toro film. But it is used in EVERY SINGLE SENTENCE. This might entertain a 14 year old for an hour and a half but not to a 17 year old looking for something more.Not to mention the plot is just awful. I get what Smith was trying to do with this movie. Basically a stupid comedy with a ridiculous premise. First of all the premise is sort of a boo-hoo situation (trying to stop a movie because of haters? Really?). Not to mention that It almost is like he ran out of material and crammed in subplots and love relationships that are more forced than Hayden Christensen's and Natalie Portman's in the Star Wars prequels. The plots are just NOT FUNNY.So will I give Kevin Smith films a re-watch? Yes. I considered this man to be my favourite comedy director when I was 13 and want to see out of curiosity if any of his other films hold up. One of my biggest problems with this movie is the fact that the focus of the film should be supporting characters and doing that might actually work if you change it to a character that can entertain people who AREN'T fourteen years old.

This not only dehumanizes them, but it strips away almost all of the material that Smith is capable of turning into either plot or humor. The film is consequently lacking both in plot, character, and humor. Smith cannot write based purely upon fantasy without that connection to reality and to human experience. It seems very odd to see that Smith has failed to get under the skin of Jay and Silent Bob, considering how much these characters have added to other films that Smith has made, and for that matter, considering that Smith plays Silent Bob himself, but apparently Jay and Silent Bob are 'spice' characters in the 'dish' of Kevin Smith movies; seemingly vital and adding an enormous amount, but utterly incomplete on their own. Instead of a tasty meal, the viewer of this film is presented with a set of salt and pepper shakers!The film is so lacking in plot that Smith has apparently attempted to make it a spoof of Hollywood, but this attempt fails miserably. Rather than spoofing Hollywood, the film effectively refers to it. This film contains the worst spoof elements that I have seen in any commercial film, up to and including the atrocious Date Movie.

When they are introduced to the world of the internet they discover that a film version is being made of the comic book that they were the inspiration for.  Not only that but people are on the message boards insulting and slandering them.  In order to stop the slander Jay and Bob decide to travel to Hollywood to stop the filming and therefore stop the internet discussions.  A cross-country adventure ensues that includes stolen monkeys, international jewel thieves, the scooby-doo gang, a star wars confrontation, many many cameos and a million rude jokes.The plot for this film is very, very weak.  However for the most part you're laughing so hard you don't care how thin it is.  It's only the middle section where the Scooby Doo bit and the jewel thief bit come in, where the jokes are less funny and the plot is more silly where you feel it.  That said it's still really funny - Jay's desire to steal/liberate a monkey in order to get a woman to sleep with him is hilarious (we steal monkeys all the time in Jersey If I'd known stealing monkeys would get me sex, I'd have been doing it since I was 7!) as is his rant on behalf of C.L.I.T.!The humour is all of one type.  If you know these characters from the other Red Bank films then you'll know if you'll like them or not.  If you don't know them already then some of the jokes here will go over your head - there's lots of in-jokes and references to actions and characters in the other films that you won't understand (although some are still funny).  Some of the references go too far and aren't funny - one joke in particular where the characters say something like who'd pay to see a movie like that? or I hate it when you get roped into a movie by a friend and then look out at the audience, isn't funny the first time or the 5th time.  However most of the jokes are really funny thanks to a) Mewes's wonderfully un-PC, obscene dealer and b) Smith's great writing.As I said some of the scenes are funny for 5 seconds but soon die out (the scooby doo bit gets dry pretty quick) but the majority is great.  Standout bits include the monkey stuff, the whole Miramax-ribbing climax, the Phantom Menace skit and Chris Rock's angry black director (very similar to Hooper in Chasing Amy).  The focus on sex related jokes makes for a film you're either going like or hate - and I loved it.  Yes too many characters from other film are shoved in unfunny scenes (Affleck's Holden is poor and Lee is given nothing to work with in the role of Brodie that he was fantastic in in Mallrats), but the majority of it is great.There are too many cameos to mention but nearly all of them are funny - high points include Chris Rock who missed out on making a black Sesame Street (he was going to call it N.W.P. - you work it out!), Carrie Fisher as the nun who lives by the book, Jason Biggs lamenting his pie-humping typecasting, Mark Hamill in the star wars spoof, the director and cast of Good Will Hunting poking major fun at Miramax and money grabbing sequels and Wes Craven directing Shannon Doherty in Scream 4 in a bang-on swipe at the Scream movies.  The main acting pressure was all on Mewes as Jay, as Bob doesn't speak enough to carry the film, and he succeeds.  Here his dirty mouth is given plenty of funny situations and good lines to work with and it ensures that his good performance carries through the whole thing and stops him getting annoying.Overall this is one funny film and a very good way to say goodbye to these characters.  Dry is some places, brilliant in others this isn't to everyone's taste but will please Smith fans easily.  It's not The Godfather but it does what it's supposed to and does it well.

It's definitely impressive to see what he has achieved already so far but that just doesn't make me a fan of his work as well.With this movie, Kevin Smith is doing what he knows best; being a geek and being proud of it. He makes lots of geek references in this movie, both with movies and comics. It's however one thing to make references, it's a totally different thing to be clever, original and funny with it. In this movie he has some hits and misses with that but overall the movie is being far too simplistic with its story.The humor of the movie is mostly very immature (yes, there are even fart jokes in it) and this movie is obviously not one to take serious, since it defies all logic. This is of course an OK thing for a comedy to do but it seemed to me that the story was being far too simplistically written and could had basically been written by any random geek, attempting for a first time to write a movie and put as many geeky stuff in it as possible. This goes for the story, as well as for most of its jokes and references. It's just not really a movie that really made me laugh. It instead more often made me cringe.Having said that, I do have to admit that the movie has some really great dialog in, which still uplifts this movie.It's a movie that is not only handing together from its references but also from its many cameos. I don't mind cameos as long as they somewhat serve a (comical) purpose and there aren't too many of them. In this movie there are obviously very many, which can get really distracting at times. Some of them are good and fun and do work out though, though that all is still really a matter of taste. I mean, some people will find the Will Ferrell part bad and annoying, while others (like myself) probably find it to be the most funny thing about the entire movie.Not really a good or funny movie by my taste and judgment, though I can still see that this movie might be really 'the' thing for some people. 5/10http//bobafett1138.blogspot.com/ "},{"Title":"An example of excess","Date":"3 April 2009","Score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy","Review":" I'm always torn about this film. On one hand, I loved some of the humor, notably the references to Smith's other creations, reviving Dante, Randall, Holden, and Banky into one picture. The humor at the Quick Stop that started it all is golden. Then there's moments from Will Ferrel, who's humor is foolproof and at home with Smith's crafted dialogue in spite of Ferrel's many improvisations. But Smith's films seem to reflect where he is at that moment in his life. Clerks was great, and while Mallrats suffered, they garnered a sizable cult following. Chasing Amy was a critical success and helped make a star out of Ben Affleck. It also succeeded because, like Clerks, it was very personal. Dogma, despite how outlandish the plot was, also had personal ties, as they addressed his feelings toward religion.So what does that make Jay And Silent Bob Strike Back? Besides revisiting the characters we love, it seemed like an exercise in excess. There's nothing to relate to in the film. The film is too self referential for its own good that there's nothing original or new in here. The humor is sporadic - in the very beginning and in the very end, it's hilarious. But it seems more like a bunch of cameos than in an honest movie. Smith was becoming more recognizable at this time and, if anything, the film seems to be about fame. But it's too much excess for me. It lacks the humanity of his previous efforts, which however perverse, had a heart at their core. That's why I liked Clerks, loved Chasing Amy, and liked Dogma in a special kinda way. This movie doesn't say anything and the dialogue is not nearly as sharp as it could be. If you like Smith's characters, you'll be amused to see them again, but Smith doesn't explore their dimensions as he had in prior movies. Jay and Bob, maybe, but let's face - there's not much too them. The movie's very slapstick, which isn't Smith's niche.

However, this film seemed to indicate that the series was running on fumes. True, this film probably didn't intend to have any serious message, but the material seems forced and just didn't seem to have the fresh appeal that Mallrats had. A monumental drawback, and this is what I think sealed the film's doom, is the enormous aura of pretentiousness given by the characters. The characters are all well-loved, the problem is that now they're ACTING like they KNOW they're well-loved. The film is not a total loss. There are a few memorable moments, particularly the Scooby-Doo sequence ranks with the best View Askew movie moments. Jay also has his biggest part in any of the 5 View Askew films, but even that isn't enough to save the film.

Kevin Smith writes and directs these masterpieces for the Mall deprived and for the more discerning cinema goer. Smith certainly doesn't aim for intellectual heights, but as well as being often very funny, the Jay character is fascinating.Jay is utterly self obsessed and abusive even to his close friend Silent Bob. He's utterly shallow towards women. He's the Clit Master and vulgar in the extreme.

She's a pretty stupid stereotype I'd say.The movie is full of running jokes, often from Kevin Smith's previous films, and also references to Star Wars (Mark Hamill and Carrie Fisher appear).

Some of the other jokes are such easy, stale humor that I was flabbergasted Smith actually expected us to find it interesting or funny.  The soundtrack, which accompanies every single line with a little twist of music, is this movie's lack of subtlety in a nutshell.  The millions of famous actors seem completely lost, with nothing to do except dutifully deliver their token lines.  Smith, a good writer, painfully overdoes Bob's expressions.  Only Jay seems natural, in his own surreal way.  I really like this character and it's amazing that he's able to survive that absolute dung that is put in his mouth for lines. He comes through the movie intact, but little else does.The plot is contrived and stale and near the end completely ceases to make any kind of sense.

In this movie, those characters only had cameos-- they played the roles which Jay and Silent Bob normally play and should have been playing in this movie, the Greek Chorus.So now our curiosity is satisfied as to what an entire movie devoted to Jay's warped brain looks like-- it ain't pretty.

"}{"Title":"An absolutely hilarious film","Date":"23 November 2015","Score":"","Genre":"Comedy","Review":" The fifth film in Kevin Smith's View Askewniverse, this is an absolutely hilarious film which very effectively parodies Hollywood. It tells the story of Jay and Silent Bob's rather eventful trip to Tinseltown to stop the production of the film adaptation of the comic Bluntman and Chronic based on their lives. As it was originally going to be the final View Askewniverse film, Smith decided to make his two signature characters the focus of the storyline for the first time. It features numerous references to the earlier films, though only a handful to Dogma, and includes at least one character (other than the eponymous drug dealers / prophets) from each of them. It does not make any allowances for those who have not seen the first four films and as such it is doubtful that people not familiar with them would be able to fully appreciate it. Smith's writing and direction are both very strong. Rather than dealing with serious topics as was the case with Chasing Amy and Dogma, the film is simply an excuse to have some fun. For my money, it is Smith's funniest film since Clerks.As it is to be expected, Jason Mewes is hysterical as Jay, who remains as foulmouthed and idiotic as ever. One of the funniest parts of the film is when he imagines a devil on each shoulder - and later a battered and bruised angel - when he considers whether he or not he should drop his trousers in front of Justice, whom he has only known for a few hours. He eventually decides against it, which is perhaps for the best. What makes the scene works as well as it does is that all the time that he is receiving advice from these imaginary spirits, Justice is getting increasingly freaked out, if not downright frightened, by the fact that he keeps looking at his shoulders and reacting to nothing. Justice, a sexy international jewel thief - is there any other kind? - with whom he quickly falls in love, is played very well by Shannon Elizabeth and she has great chemistry with Mewes. When it comes to his relationship with Justice, Jay displays a softer side, after a fashion, and even stops calling her a bitch at her request. He instead calls her boom boom kitty f***. He becomes so gallant and debonair as the film progresses that he could easily be mistaken for David Niven. Although he has far more screen time than in the previous films, Silent Bob has only two lines - perhaps he fell out with the writer-director - but his facial expressions communicate a great deal throughout. Smith's use of the film to mock his online critics may not have been the most mature thing in the world to do but, by God, it was funny.The film is basically an exercise in self-indulgence on the one hand and breaking the fourth wall on the other. And I love it for that! For instance, Ben Affleck reprises his role as Holden McNeil from Chasing Amy in the early part of the film and praises the talents of the talented young actor Ben Affleck, though he was not too fond of Good Will Hunting. Later in the film, he plays himself and is depicted filming a scene of the considerably more violent Good Will Hunting 2 Hunting Season with Matt Damon, who is still annoyed that Affleck convinced him to do Dogma. Gus Van Sant has a cameo as the uninterested director, who spends his entire time leafing through a script, seemingly that of another film. Perhaps he was contemplating doing a shot-for-shot remake of Clerks. I would love to see the fictional Scream 4 in which Jay and Silent Bob's orangutan friend Suzanne is revealed to be Ghostface! Jason Lee reprises his role as both Brodie Bruce and Banky Edwards from Mallrats and Chasing Amy respectively. Even though he has only one scene as Brodie, he manages to be funnier than he was at any point in Mallrats as he was given much better material. If there is one thing that I have learned from the View Askewniverse films, it is that New Jersey has a surprisingly small gene pool for a place with almost nine million people. Will Ferrell is good as Marshal Willenholly but he could have been considerably better. Eliza Dushku, Ali Larter and Smith's wife Jennifer Schwalbach are great fun as Sissy, Chrissy and Missy, Justice's partners in crime who are basically evil versions of Charlie's Angels. In skintight black leather. Chris Rock is incredibly funny as the Bluntman and Chronic director Chaka Luther King. Any resemblance to Spike Lee is purely coincidental. The film is full to the brim with great cameos but my favourites other than those I have already mentioned are Carrie Fisher as a nun, George Carlin as a hitchhiker, Mark Hamill as himself playing Bluntman and Chronic's arch-nemesis Cocknocker, Judd Nelson as a sheriff, Joey Lauren Adams as Alyssa Jones, Dwight Ewell as Hooper X (who is seemingly Banky's boyfriend these days), Jason Biggs and James Van Der Beek as themselves and, of course, Brian O'Halloran as Dante and Jeff Anderson as Randal.Overall, this is a laugh riot from start to finish.

Come on whites get called racists because of this how come black people could get away with this?! Anyway the movie was very good it had a very good cast, with the exception of Chris rock. Overall I think the funniest scene was when the orangutan likely kills Jason Biggs and the other guy dressed up as Jay. I mean wasn't expecting it, that was ingenious. I give it a 7 out of 10.

Jay and Silent Bob is by far one of the funniest, most memorable comedy films ever. You have two hilarious characters, Jay (Jason Mewes), and Silent Bob (Kevin Smith) two potheads who seek revenge because they earn no money for their creation. The film has many different roles from huge, major actors - including appearances from Chris Rock, Jason Lee, Ben Affleck and Shannon Elizabeth. The film is not a hit-and-miss, one-time-viewing kinda film. It's one of those films you can watch over and over and it still has the same effect on you every time you watch it. Its impact is fantastic, the comedy is always very funny, the characters are always great to watch over and over again, it just never gets old. Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back is by far one of the most incredibly funny and comical films ever made. The iconic characters make the film superb! 10/10.

Clerks, Dogma, and Mallrats I really like, even Chasing Amy is decent enough. So going in, I didn't know what to expect. Jay and Silent Bob had always been kind of in the background, so I was glad to hear that they were stretching this into a feature.There are a lot of good laughs throughout and I really liked it. Of course, the plot isn't supposed to be taken seriously and the characters are quirky. Even though Jay can be obnoxious, this character still has a lot of heart to him. Kevin Smith as Silent Bob is enjoyable to watch and when he finally says something, it's like a breath of fresh air. This movie is full of satire, endless cameos, and so many cross references to Smith's other films.It's one of those funny comedies that you watch with some friends late on a Saturday night. This was a pleasant surprise and I wasn't disappointed. I recommended it to anyone who like Kevin Smith's work and isn't easily offended!

This film is definitely for the latter - those who have watched writer/director/star's previous work, i.e. Clerks, Mallrats, Chasing Amy and Dogma - all of which are set in the same timeline (or 'Askewniverse' to use the technical term). In other words, you'll get the most out of Jay and Silent Bob's movie if you've seen what's gone before (in the correct order).If you're the former, you may like it, but it'll be a bit of a fluke it you do - it'll mean that you're probably into immature, smutty gags and smoke pot - which is mainly what's contained within the movie.You really have to put your brain on hold, or at least move it down into your boots because the humour here is as low-brow as you're going to get. It's mainly a case of 'know what you're getting' with this film. If you're prepared for one of the daftest, smuttiest, stupidest road trip movies ever made, which follows the exploits of two pot-heads who want to stop a movie about their life being made in Hollywood, then you'll probably enjoy this. If you're looking for something a little more intellectual then steer well clear.Bonus points to the film-makers for getting what must be one of the longest lists of celebrity cameos ever assembled for a movie - every one sends themselves up beautifully.I enjoyed it tremendously - in all it's low brow glory.

Now, objectively, it is not particularly that great of a film, relying heavily on potty humor and celebrity cameos. But it has a self-referential style that has to be appreciated.The first three films remain the strongest, and I think Dogma was a step down (a view that few people agree with). I blame this on the characters being more mobile -- the style switched from being conversation and dialogue-based to being much more active. This film is also quite active, but that almost seems like part of the joke -- it is, after all, something of a road movie.The jokes with Brodie, Dante and others were a bit too easy... but Ben Affleck joking about himself makes it all worth it.

A following roadtrip ensures.

They are unfunny and can't act ass poop; but so all of the other people around. Especially the all star cameos showcased. They were gathered for nothing; because the direction, script and plot were so weak, that no-one could save this ridiculous mess; not even collectively. &BTW, they're fugly and metrogay too; but that won't matter to their minions.

The best parts of 'Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back' are the 'Hollywood' sequences and the scene where the spandex clad women steal diamonds. This movie spoofily spins off Smith's earlier works (except 'Dogma') and it brilliantly parodies numerous Hollywood flicks. There are plenty of cameos where the actors are spoofing themselves. The first hour or so, is loaded with toilet humour but much of it is quite boring mostly because of Jason Mewes's poor acting. Kevin Smith, Ben Affleck and Will Ferrell are brilliant. Shannon Elizabeth is quite a treat as the sexy nerdy jewel thief who is voluptuously supported by lesbian sidekicks played hilariously by Eliza Dushku and Ali Larter. Needless to say, while the humour is crude, vulgar and slapstick, there's also plenty of satire. Obviously Kevin Smith has made this movie for people who loved his earlier works and even though 'Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back' does not hold a candle to them, it offers plenty for laughs.

I was really excited with this one and while it didn't turn out to be a Kevin Smith movie that I would like to re-visit, it did have some truly genius moments. Not a disappointment, to be clear. I saw it last night by myself, and at some point my cousin walked in the living room. He had never seen any Kevin Smith movie and saw a scene that was totally unrelated with our main characters Jay and Silent Bob. I mean, sure every scene here is related with them but what my cousin saw was a scene that could be from any parody of an action movie. He even said to me so it's one of those movies, referring to the not very clever kind of parody movies. But I said to him, it's really about other really funny characters. And is all clichéd certainly, that's the idea since the beginning with the big our main characters are GOING TO Hollywood kind of thing. Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back is sometimes a real mess, and by that I just mean that it is a not very funny movie. It's the over-the-top kind of thing that becomes really ridiculous instead of just plain f****** hilarious. But the other times, this movie is plain f****** hilarious and clever. And it's really stuff that is a must for anyone who has enjoyed the other Kevin Smith movies. We have Jay and Silent Bob, so there are really great laughs indeed. On the other hand, we have the cameos of people like George Carlin, Wes Craven, Matt Damon, Mark Hamill and Gus Van Sant. It's clever stuff. And, for example, the Gus Van Sant cameo is enough for me to call this worth watching material, as the cameo is as plain hilarious as surprising. I just love when you find guys like Van Sant or Craven playing the game. And here you'll find lots of this. Thankfully. So, this is Kevin Smith doing just about everything he wanted to, from having the band The Time playing, kicking the asses of angry nerds (who threw s*** on the Internet to Jay and Silent Bob) to have Ben Affleck as himself after having Ben Affleck as Holden talking about Ben Affleck. Worth watching, like I said.

The comic-book was turned into a film without their knowledge or consent, so Jay and Silent Bob decide to forego any potential cash from the project in favour of canning the thing entirely. Rather than make a phone call or send an email they decide to set off from one coast of the United States to the other.There are gay jokes / poo jokes / clit jokes / d*ck jokes / fart jokes / masturbation jokes and more, including much mugging towards camera and plenty of in-jokes for Smith fans.For Smith there are internet jokes / a Star Wars rip off sequence / a billion pop culture references / and a monkey...There are cameos galore George Carlin / Carrie Fisher / Mark Hamill / Ben Affleck & Matt Damon (& Gus Van Sant) / John Stewart / Jason Biggs & James Van Der Beek / Judd Nelson / Diedrich Bader / Tracey Morgan / Sean William Scott / Wes Craven & Shannon Doherty / Chris Rock / and Will Ferrell... The best laughs from the cameos? Bader (Oh what a lovely tea party) and Damon / Affleck / Van Sant in the Good Will Hunting sequel (Applesauce bitch!).And if you don't understand it all there are three hotties in tight outfits... and Kevin Smith's missus who tags along with them (sorry Kev).I think it is more a by-product of making a film with a massive cast but this film has the best performances by Sean William Scott, Ferrell, Morgan and Chris Rock in many years, only because none is asked to be on screen for more than 20 minutes at most, as they are all equally tiresome when you realize that their initial shtick is all that they have. Ferrell has already started to feel the backlash at his tired antics, Chris Rock hasn't been a draw for... ever aside from stand up and Morgan's drop is rapidly approaching.Ask Kevin himself, he cast Morgan in Cop Out and said Action which helped me prove just that.Final Rating - 7 / 10.

Along the way, they pick up a baby orangutan when they release animals from a lab. With the orangutan in tow, they become the Three Stooges of stoner humor. Many, many familiar faces show up in big and small roles, including Will Ferrell as a hapless federal wildlife official trying to recover the orangutan and Carrie Fisher as a nun, of all things. Directors Wes Craven an Gus Van Sant make brief appearances, God knows why. Matt Damon and Ben Affleck play themselves as a couple of preening imbeciles shooting GOOD WILL HUNTING 2, in which Damon makes like Rambo. Jason Biggs and James Van der Beek play the Hollywood version of our intrepid duo, called Bluntman and Chronic, and Mark Hamill has a funny bit as a supervillain in that bizarre movie.

The characters worked so brilliantly as supporting characters in Clerks, Chasing Amy, and Dogma, but even when given significant screen time in Mallrats they kind of outstayed their welcome. Silent Bob is alright but Jay's schoolboy humor works fine in small doses but include too much of it and it just makes the film too generally juvenile and ludicrous to take seriously (which, on some level, Mallrats wanted to be). How do you side-step this problem when making the big Jay and Silent Bob flick? You make the whole thing completely ludicrous. Not a hint of the intelligent scripts Dogma and Chasing Amy had here, just a deliberately ludicrous plot and plenty of dick and fart jokes.So, is this any good? Surprisingly, Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back is fairly entertaining throughout with some scenes standing out as hopelessly bad (Mooby's, Shannon Elizabeth, and Mewes= lethal combination, not in a good way) and some working pretty well. No comment on the plot, it's pretty wacky but it works fine I guess, with Will Ferrell and the always good and always gorgeous Eliza Dushku shining in the ensemble.Kevin Smith's highest-budgeted film to date by some margin, Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back goes for the mass appeal, and while it is significantly worse than Dogma, Chasing Amy, or Clerks (thus far the only really good films Smith has made) it is not the huge misfire Mallrats was and doesn't for a second waste time on hopelessly sappy moments like Jersey Girl and Clerks II did.The best portion of the film comes towards the end as Jay and Silent Bob arrive in Hollywood. I didn't stop giggling at the Gus Van Sant cameo for a long time. Basically, this portion of the film is a bunch of self-referential gags aimed mostly at Smith's fanbase. Being 'in the know' helps. All in all this is as good as it was ever going to be. We do, of course, get 90+ minutes mostly comprised of juvenile humor and if that works for you great, but I found it tiresome in spots.

When given the leading roles, they manage to be funny but they also manage to overdo it.Jay (Jason Mewes) is a character I like, however, of all the movies he's been in, I like him the least in this one and it's mostly because he doesn't work as a leading man. He was very good in Clerks, Mallrats, Chasing Amy (that one scene) and Dogma. But in this one, his humor got tiring and got a little repetitive. It's a good thing that in Clerks II he returned to the supporting part and was as great as I remembered.Silent Bob (Kevin Smith) is such a fun character for a guy who says so little. In Clerks he was like Jay's shadow, he was very introverted and hardly given a personality. In Mallrats the new Silent Bob was born, the lovable guy who was more extroverted and way funnier. This version was seen again in Chasing Amy and Dogma. In this movie, he's my favorite character. Like I said, Jay's humor got a bit repetitive, but it's a good thing that The Bob was there to even it out.The supporting characters are a laugh riot. Cameos everywhere featuring Shannen Doherty, Wes Craven, Carrie Fisher and more. My favorites would have to be Ben Affleck and Matt Damon playing themselves in one of the funniest parts of the movie. Chris Rock was very funny and Mark Hamill was hilarious as well.Overall, a weak but decent movie.

The others being Clerks., Mallrats, Chasing Amy and Dogma. It's not like that should be a big deal, seeing as they are all awesome movies. I will admit to this, I saw this movie before I watched the other movies. To be honest, I still enjoyed the movie a whole lot. So I would say it can be enjoyable in many ways on its own, but I will also say this- The second time I watched the movie, which was after seeing the others, this movie went from being a pretty funny comedy to being one of my favourite movies.It's a crazy storyline fitting for Jay and Silent Bob. I guess you could sort of compare the whole movie to their scenes in Mallrats. Monkeys, sexy girls and Will Ferrell... what more could you want from a movie like this? Don't watch the movie if you're looking for something like Chasing Amy, as this movie differs from it in many ways. Actually, on second thought scratch that. You should watch it, because even though it is different, it's still awesome on many different levels. It's not a serious movie in any sense of the word. It's just a whole lot of fun.Jay and Silent Bob are great characters, and though only seen in small doses in previous movies, (save for Dogma) they are able to make do as the main characters with flying colours. I don't really know what else to say, except that the jokes are awesome, it has great references to its own universe and basically the film industry as a whole, and it's full of more awesome celebrity appearances than you can poke a stick at. Awesome movie, and one I can watch again and again. "},{"Title":"Absurdity at its best","Date":"11 April 2008","Score":"","Genre":"Comedy","Review":" This film is absurdity at its best.

For some reason it was fairly easy on Dogma references, the only reference to it I can think of being '...passed down by god herself...' I thought this film would be mostly terrible, but it wasn't at all, the self-loving brings it down, but Jay And Silent Bob are great as usual, the plot is throwaway, and could be replaced with anything to just make Jay and Bob run around, but not too many complaints about it. Any references to previous View Askew films later on in the film, were scattered around well enough to not make them cringe-worthy, although it's too heavy on them right at the end. One thing I really disliked about the film, although I forgive it is Jason Mewes' fart near the beginning of the movie, that was the most cringe-worthy thing to do with Kevin Smith ever, and not because of the vulgarity, like I'd cringe at 'it was like sticking my dick in battery acid', because of the sheer thoughtlessness of it, I can forgive it though as in the commentary Kevin Smith admitted to it being his least favourite shot in anything he's ever done, although he did also say he was proud of the fart joke with Ali Larter, which was something I definitely could've done without in the film. Smith took a risk by returning to his low-brow roots of Mallrats (and taking it further), after doing the more thoughtful (for his standards) Dogma and Chasing Amy, he also took a risk by putting Will Ferrel in a semi-major role in the film, many Smith fans may dislike his inclusion, but me personally, I enjoyed his performance a lot, despite not really being a fan. Could've been an 8/10 without all the self indulgent rubbish. Smith denies sitting at home thinking 'I am a f**king comic genius' on his DVD An Evening With Kevin Smith 2, but I'm not so sure. So I took this time to address all the negatives about this film, what about all the positives? The positives of this film were...everything else I hadn't mentioned! I was expecting a return to low brow humour and was expecting a lot worse. Was the worst of the VA films but after Clerks 2, he is back on form.

The proliferation of gay gags may be a worrying trend, (most of the jokes seems to be about guys giving as well as receiving blow-jobs). Maybe not this may be as daring as Smith gets.

It was essentially one of hope. Clerks is excellent but under it all is a undercurrent of promise that Smith will return with a bigger budget, better actors and a more accomplished directorial flair to create his masterwork. That Clerks is still his best film provokes a feeling of disappointment in me. Mallrats was a bit rubbish and while Dogma and in particular Chassing Amy had some strokes of genius they didn't provide the emotional sucker punch of Clerks to go with the belly laughs.And that's my problem with Jay & Silent Bob Strike Back Still not Smith's master work. It is however very very funny. You remember the bit in Dogma when Jay & Bob are on the train and you can overhear them talking to Loci about the bit in Mallrats? Well this film is basically those kind of in-jokes from start to finish. The film requires not only that you have seen all of Smith's earlier films, but that you have seen them multiple time and regularly say THIRTY-SEVEN!!! to your friends when you are surprised. Witness people asking Dante Are you even supposed to be hear today? and so on. If you know Smith's work you will howl. But other than the in-jokes there's really nothing much to sink your teeth into. In the opinion of this reviewer Will Ferrel is simply not funny. I was enraptured to hear later that Simth had left about 70% of Ferrel's performance on the cutting-room floor. There is still too much of his gawking stupidity which wouldn't be so bad if he didn't commit the cardinal sin of not been funny when he's supposed to be the comic relief.The plot, while not important contrives the eponymous characters going on a road trip to Hollywood to stop production of the Blunt Man and Chronic film. This after Ben Affleck shows them all the mean stuff people had been saying about them and... no I won't tell you because the scene where Affleck shows Jay and Bob the internet is one of the best scenes.The other thing that made this film for me was all the cameos. Carrie Fisher turns up as a nun (complete with buddy Christ on her dash-board) Silent Bob has a light sabre fight with Mark Hammil (usually such obvious self-indulgence would annoy me, especially with regard to Star Wars, but hey it's really Mark Hammil) Gus Van Saint appears as the money-counting uber-hack director of Good Will Hunting 2 Hunting Season; Was Craven shows up directing his latest Scream cash-in; Even Chris Rock appears as a Black director only to give the best line in the film.So get some friends round, drink some beers, shmoke some weed and enjoy Kevin Smith apparently closing the book on his beloved View Askunivers.

The 'plot' (If you could call it that) is that Jay and Silent Bob are given a restraining order due to their actions while standing around the quick stop all day. While trying to find a new place they find out they haven't been payed for a movie being based off a comic that is at the same time based off them. After learning about the internet, they hear lots of people bad mouthing them and their movie. So they try to head to Hollywood to stop the movie from being made. Along the way, they make so many attacks on Hollywood, as well as well known characters, and best of all, well known actors and comedians appear as themselves (Or at least reference themselves as a separate character) and take a s*** all over themselves. One of my personal favorites is when they are in Hollywood, they are looking for a monkey that was taken too Hollywood to be an actor (That they were keeping because Jay was under the impression a girl he met, who wanted to 'liberate' the monkey, was blown up, so he wanted to keep the monkey as a reminder of her) and they end up on the set of another scream movie. When she unmasks the villain, it is the monkey, and she walks over to Wes Craven and tells him 'Wes, what's happening!? Your not even trying anymore!' 'Well, everyones gonna love the monkey!' and Jay and Silent Bob come in and say 'We LOVE the monkey (While taking it)' and then Craven says 'See?' It's not perfect, but it's unique, and while it is extremely crude (And in many places, very stupid, but it was meant to be) it has a very intelligent form of humor (Beleive it or not!)

Replete with what it considers 'movie in-jokes' and extremely liberal use of the 'F-word' and other more imaginative swearing. The simple plot revolves around the eponymous duo's journey to Hollywood to prevent a movie being made based on their lives, and the adventures they have on the way across the USA. But instead of putting effort into plot, everything goes into creating ways of crowbarring in as many star cameos and movie references as possible. For a film rated 18, its juvenile nature is quite staggering. Whereas Dogma and Clerks were extremely original in their aim, Jay and Silent Bob is crude and generally aimless beyond boobs and f-bombs.Yet there are a few laughs to be had from the numerous stars happy to poke fun at themselves, including Ben Affleck, Matt Damon, Mark Hamill, Jason Biggs and James Van Der Beek. The sheer volume of guest stars to spot almost makes the film worth watching on its own. And no doubt the target audience (15-18 year old boys, never mind the film being rated 18!) will enjoy the constant swearing and fart jokes, not to mention seeing Ali Larter, Eliza Dushku and Shannen Elizabeth in skin-tight PVC outfits.But please Kevin Smith, let your pride and joy creations that were once a welcome side-act rest.

Not so much Dogma - I know still a part of his New Jersey Trilogy, but that actually had an apocalyptic plot with characters outside the usual framework of Smith's stories. I'm sure Smith wanted to wrap up things for himself as well, but this is strictly for those who remember the 1st 3 pictures, with an intensity ranging from fondness (me) to fanaticism (who, them?). Not that it's not funny for strangers to the saga. It most resembles Mallrats - my personal favorite since it was the most plot less; the key was that you, the viewer, are just hanging out with the characters, who are essentially time-wasters and idiots, but remind you of yourself in your less than impressive moments. You're not just watching, as in an ordinary movie, you're involved with these slackers, especially if you can relate to all the super-hero references and movie homages. Also, if you don't mind the constant fart & sex joking, and the cussing. Yes, it's juvenile, but there is a lot of charm there, as well. Some may turn their noses up on the material but usually snicker to themselves when in private.Some of the humor is pretty inspired. You find out that Jay & Silent Bob didn't know anything about the Internet until an early scene in this movie; then you see they're unaware you have to pay for a bus ride. This is naivety taken to the nth degree, a commentary on someone who's never been out of a New Jersey area, I guess. So these two know-nothings, babes in the woods, embark on a Hobbit-like odyssey cross-country, an ultimate road-trip, if you will. And whatta cast. Smith brings back almost everyone from those first 3 movies, and adds in Ferrell as the stupidest cop, plus a few young actresses as lethal criminals. The picture moves along very quickly. Once in Hollywood, other familiar faces show up, notably Hamill as a super-villain (Smith can't get enuff Star Wars references in). There's a really amusing scene with Biggs & van der Beek, discussing the gay issue. Some of the actors play more than one character - you get to see Affleck in two roles, the one true abomination in an essentially inoffensive flic. I'm also curious as to how Smith talked Damon into this; it's refreshing in this day and age to see certain 'high-level' actors willing to make asses of themselves. The biggest role is by Mewes and he pulls it off. Again, all of this is less confusing if you've seen the earlier movies and you get to see Mewes evolve through this latest one. What, Mewes - evolve?

But that doesn't mean you won't like it if you aren't one of the legions of fans.When this movie came out, I was ten years old. A friend of mine saw it, having not seen any of the previous View Askew movies. As soon as he saw it, he was singing it's praises for a month. As he reviewed the movie to me, I though to myself My parents are never going to allow me to watch this. Flash forward four years, and a friend of my mom's shows me Dogma. Loved it. When I told her that I wanted to see Strike Back, she said no, not until I watch the other four films. I did that, and loved it.This movie is vulgar, it is crass, it may offend you. But most likely, it will have you rolling on the floor laughing. Yes, it is a 30 million dollar monument to View Askew, but it's funny as Hell.

Jay n Silent Bob allow us to laugh at ourselves, others, Hollywood, themselves and everyone else in this light hearted comedy clearly directed at the heart of Hollywood's establishment, its disconnect with reality and it's inane lack of vision. While the fart, dick and gay puns would seem to have grown old long before this flick even went to production, nothing seems stale at all in the delivery, possibly due to the colorful cast loaded with entertaining and often surprising cameos. Gus makes a great joke of himself and the entire industry from his director's chair. Doherty slams Miramax even further. While all of the industry's protests pile throughout the movie, the lighthearted x-country romp never loses pace.

That said then, does he hit his intended targets?Yes, but not nearly enough of the time. What is essentially sketch comedy is forced into a (dumb) linear plot and stretched out far too long. Jay and Silent Bob could thrive within the confines of a 30-minute TV program, albeit it would have to be on cable. But trying to tell a movie-length story? Nope.

But a few things are annoying... maybe cause Jay doesn't smoke enough dope and he seems too clear headed- and since the boys are the main 'men' here... it's as if Silent & Jay are trying too hard to make the plot have a real druggie dimension until it gets lost in its own reflection. Which is a pity... cause I wanted to like this movie- but nup!And this was one of those flix where perfection isn't necessary- there are lots of continuity gaffs that make the movie funny too -like when the four girls run out of the diamond exchange before they could have got those ugly high-heel shoes on, but they get into their car wearing shoes again- but this all added to my enjoyment.The main problem for me was the way Silent Bob twisted his face- so he's frowning or shrugging his shoulders in time to what Jay says- which becomes totally naff. The thing about Silent Bob is that he has the potential to be really funny if he does nothing. Still, one good thing was Bob's affair with the orangutan- it was very sweet- truly touching and believable. Sometimes the action gets a bit bogged down in all the stars who pop in and out of scenes- but I liked the Scooby Doo/ Josie & the Pussycat psychedelia in the van with Justice, Sissy, Missy & Chrissy. SO what went awry? Maybe they tried too hard to be funny? Not sure- but I won't watch it again- even to see that cute orangutan tonguing Bob.

The main problem i had with this was, the lack of laughs , most of the time it failed to amuse me, however, i had an okay time watching this, as there are plenty of gorgeous women, and a cool story to keep you watching. Jason Mewes is quite annoying, and rather unfunny, however Kevin Smith is hilarious, and steals the show in my opinion. Ben Affleck was actually funny in his 2 roles, and i really liked some of the spoofs, especially the one with Jason Biggs and James Vandeerbeek. While this was okay entertainment, this really didn't do anything for me, while i say it's worth a rent, it's nothing special what so ever. The Direction is decent.Kevin Smith does a decent job here, keeping the film at a decent pace for the most part, and doing a solid job. The Acting is terrible, but some of it was fun to watch. Jason mews is terrible here, and found him very unfunny, he was too stupid for me, plus his character was annoying, he had great chemistry with Kevin Smith though. Kevin Smith is terrible here, he is unfunny and he is funnier then Mewes but that isn't saying much, I can't stand this guy. Ben Affleck is actually funny here, normally a terrible actor, he is quite funny here and was fun to watch in both his roles. Shannon Elizabeth is STUNNINGLY GORGEOUS!, and is fine here, with what she had to do, she was funny, and had decent chemistry with Mewes, but really all she need to be was eye candy and it worked VERY well!. Eliza Dushku is also STUNNINGLY GORGEOUS, and played her stuck up bitch part well!. Ali Larter is GORGEOUS, and did fine with what she had to do, which was not much. Will Ferrell is always a mixed bag to me, on one hand, he annoys the crap out of me on the other hand, he makes me laugh at times, here he is terribly unfunny, and totally over did it in my opinion.George Carlin,Judd Nelson,Carrie Fisher,Seann William Scott,Gus Van Sant,Chris Rock,Jamie Kennedy,Wes Craven,Shannen Doherty,Mark Hamill,Joey Lauren Adams,Alanis Morissette,Jason Biggs,Matt Damon,James Van Der Beek, all do good in there short roles/cameos.

Or at least a fan of other Kevin Smith movies. If haven't seen allot of movies, then most of the jokes will go right over your head. Check out Good Will Hunting, Scream, Planet of the apes, and many many others. Well heres my review As you might expect from a film carrying the title Jay And Silent Bob Strike Back, the film centers on those lovable stoner's who have popped up in all of Kevin Smith's movies to date. Unlike those movies, Jay and Bob are no longer just supporting characters, but now have the whole film to themselves. The gist of the plot is as follows. Jay and Silent Bob discover that Miramax pictures are making a live action adaptation of Bluntman and Chronic, the comic book heroes they form the character basis for (see Smith's Chasing Amy for further details). Around this time they also discover the Internet, or more specifically that the Internet has been used to roundly slate the upcoming film, and both the characters of Bluntman and Chronic.Nearly everyone who has appeared in a Smith movie return in a cameo, including Jason Lee, Ben Affleck, Matt Damon, Joey Lauren Adams, Renee Humphreys, Dwight Ewell, George Carlin, Chris Rock and even Shannen Doherty. There is also a huge cast of new characters, with some fine comedic performances from Will Ferrell, Eliza Dushku, Ali Larter, Jason Biggs, James Van Der Beek and Sean William Scott. The real star of the show is Jason Mewes, who manages to carry off the role of leading man quite admirably considering he's not a 'real' actor. He may be a foul-mouthed little smack head, but he also happens to be very amusing.Like all Kevin Smith movies this is very vulgar and not for everyone, but I gotta say I love it!

And if you aren't an avid cinema fan you won't get much of the other half either.Featuring various characters from all his previous flicks combined and constantly referencing other movies while taking a stab at popular culture, courtesy of his excellent skills as a writer. This is probably not a film your mother would care much about thanks to it's extremely crude tone. However if you are one of the people it was made for chances are you will have a riot here. Ever since Clerk's (smiths first film) it was pretty obvious that the character's of JAY and Silent Bob should get their own film. And they don't disappoint from Jay's hilarious delivery of his outrageous brand of toilet humour to Silent Bob's light sabre duel with Mark Hamill at the films brilliant climax its a movie that fan's could not help but adore.What of the none Smith followers though?. Well there could still be just enough here to entertain those people too. Being smith's most mainstream film to date and actually his most mature as director. JASBSB contains none of the indie quirk and limited direction associated with Clerks, Mallrats and Chasing Amy . This is a bigger budgeted, star packed feature, that has as good a screenplay as any of his other work and will probably also find an audience with anyone who likes a well made comedy or simply anyone who likes to hear people making fun of Ben Affleck's career.

While J&SBSB is not the best comedy ever, it would definitely go into my top five favorite comedy movies.  I especially like the countless references to Smith's previous films, of which there are many, and the numerous spoofs on other movies, such as Star Wars (duh), Batman, Star Trek (perhaps not the movie, I just know there's some in there), Jaws, etc etc.  Having also enjoyed said movies (with exception of Star Trek, never seen it), I was happy to see them in a satiric light (especially Star Wars, I thought the Bluntman and Chronic scene was classic).  The acting was agreeably not exceptional, but often comedies are not about the acting (many of you will probably disagree with me on this but, oh well), but who can deliver a punch-line, and do it in a funny manner, hence, the comedy genre classification.  As was aforementioned, this, to me, was a nice wrap up for a series of five films, including Clerks (1994), Mallrats (1995), Chasing Amy (1997 I believe), Dogma (1999), and said movie, Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back (2001).  Jay and Silent Bob were always my favorite characters in the movies (Brodie was hysterical in Mallrats, however), and I can relate to Jay, since he uses my type of humor, which is crude, vulgar, and explicit.  No, I do not smoke weed, but I still understand the references (but then again who doesn't).  I saw Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back first of the five movies (as backwards as that is), but it made me want to see its predecessors, which is saying something, as most fifth movies in a series suck and tire the subject.  Conclusively, this is a movie that I would recommend to anyone to watch, who hasn't seen it and likes crude comedies.P.S. Countless numbers of Jay's lines were classic to me, including the scene in Mooby's on the computer, his rap at the beginning, the ever-present Snootchie Bootchies, and his complete overuse of the F-bomb.

I thought it was the best of the whole series, until I saw View Askew, Part 5.Just as I made the mistake of passing over Shaft for Scary Movie in 2000, I passed over this movie to see Ghost World in 2001, and I now realize I made a huge mistake, because although I like both, J & SB was much funnier.In the final Jay and Silent Bob movie, the dope dealers of Red Bank are finally thrown in jail and legally kept away from the Quick Stop & RST Video(Clerks). Somehow, a conversation with Brodie Bruce(Mallrats) leads to the fact that they are the inspiration for a comic book by Holden McNeil and Banky Edwards(Chasing Amy), which leads them on a quest for money they were promised for likeness rights. A brief trip on the internet at Holden's place shows various net-nerds criticizing the comic book, the movie, and the two dirt merchants themselves, and makes Jay think the movie should be stopped. From there the movie really takes off.After being kicked off a bus(one of the deleted scenes), they try hitchhiking, when they meet a man who's more successful at it, apparently because he's willing to turn gay for rides. I've hitchhiked before and I've never given up my sexuality for a ride. From there they meet a nun, a group of cartoon characters, four refugees from Switchblade Sisters; all of whom are bisexual babes who pretend to be animal rights extremists, one of which Jay falls in love with. If you think Shannon Elizabeth was hot in the first two American Pie movies, seeing her as Justice will make you forget those roles, because she's even better looking here. Unfortunately they also run into a lame protest song writer who loves animals a little too much, a bumbling US Wildlife Marshall, a sheriff played by, of all people Judd Nelson, two Hollywood-based dopplegangers of the self-proclaimed Mac Daddies of Jersey, and Mirimax's cast and crew.As for one of the comments on this board made on April 19, 2003, I don't think I'll have to worry about a real-life character from Endless Love(1981) coming to my house to beat the living sh** out of me...do I? Be sure to get a copy of the DVD for the deleted scenes, many of which really should have been left in the original movie, like their time on the bus, and the encounter with the two Hollywood Hookers. The fact that these scenes were cut is the most unfortunate hack job on a movie since It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World(1963). Reminiscing and missing scenes aside, Kevin Smith salutes his characters and audience with a movie that wraps everything up an a funny-looking bow that will be enjoyed and remembered for years to come. "},{"Title":"Who would watch a Jay & Bob movie?","Date":"16 October 2003","Score":"","Genre":"Comedy","Review":"  Ben Affleck really captures the spirit of this film with that statement in more ways than I believe Kevin Smith intended.  It's weird because I like the Jay and Silent Bob characters, but I think they're a lot funnier in the smaller sub-plot roles a la Clerks.  In Mall Rats Jay started to get on my nerves, but the duo's ridiculous (yet hilarious) antics were performed with just enough moderation to keep things at a reasonably sane (for Kevin Smith) level.  Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back lets that restraint go and gives the pair the limelight so the audience can see for the first time how retarded these two characters really are . . . and they're not funny anymore.  Like the little kid who gets himself all hyped up and into the joke to force the humor upon all those listening.  Sure, Jay and Silent Bob are funny in other movies, but giving them their own movie?  It has its moments . . . its own chuckles, but overall it's just too much.Still a Kevin Smith film, still fun to look for Smith's usual trademarks and his satirical commentary on other films and the world around him with fun cameos . . . still a stupid plot (not a complaint . . . I mean, what kind of plot do you give to Jay and Silent Bob?).  I like Kevin Smith and I like his dynamic duo; I really do.  Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back is everything I like about Kevin Smith thrown into overdrive . . . and it's not entertaining to me in such excess.  Hardcore fans will probably really go for it, but it's just too much for me.

"},{"Title":"It may be hardly clerkin' - but it's still a blast","Date":"20 September 2003","Score":"","Genre":"Comedy","Review":"  Final Score 7.9 (out of 10)After reaching a carrier high with the realization of his dream project, the sure-to-be-classic Dogma, Kevin Smith sends off his fireplug mascots Jay and Silent Bob with their own film. A relatively unnecessary, anti-climactic collage of self-indulgent, self referential gags where Smith basically pats himself on the back for creating such a cash cow out of two foul mouthed stoners. Sounds like I'm complaining doesn't it? Actually, despite a pretty useless story, some beaten-to-death parodies and occasional patches of groan inducing humor, when it's all said and done 'Jay and Silent Bob' manages to be a rare crude studio comedy that doesn't compromise on it's simple vision and escapes with it's base intact. While it's hardly the grand finale that Smith promised, 'Strike Back' is a novelty movie at it's ballsiest.Made to give background muppets Jay and Silent Bob their own feature, it creates an interesting narrative role-reversal. This time instead of J & SB wandering into other people's stories as the comic relief, these two (both the preverbal R2-D2 and C-3P0 sidekick figures) become the axis at which all the other actors, who would normally be the stars, revolve around. Now it's people like Ben Affleck, Jason Lee, Joey Lauren Adams, Jason Biggs, James Van Der Beek and Mark Hamell all at the mercy of the Jay and Silent Bob universe. All to be cast off to the periphery of the screen whenever they no longer serve a purpose for the two new leads. Still, Kevin Smith also seems to know that Jay and Silent Bob aren't exactly 3 dimensional enough to hang an entire movie on... and that's really the way we like it anyway. So without changing them, he turns the movie into a non-stop barrage of cameos and parodies for our heroes to walk in and out of. But with Jay and Silent Bob at the helm you can guarantee that this movie isn't going to have the well thought-out philosophizing of 'Clerks', 'Chasing Amy' or 'Dogma', so this marks Kev's first pure comedy - a d**k and fart joke movie without the intelligent subtext. Problem? Na, just variety. It's a fun thing to see Jay (Jason Mewes, doing that thing he does so well) and Silent Bob (Kevin Smith himself getting laughs with bulged out eyes and the token showstopper scene where Bob speaks) in command of the action. The movie is funny enough and gleefully fun enough to elevate the rest of the movie and keep this tight-rope walk from falling off the fence.The story, as it were, finds Smith in his usual element - jokes abide surrounding comic books, movies, homosexuals, Star Wars and, of course, internet geeks - an all along the way Smith winks at the camera and gives us explanations and references to his previous 4 movies. Jay and Silent Bob travel from the QuickStop (a joy to see in living color) to Hollywood to sabotage a movie production. How? They aren't quite sure until it - like most everything - falls in their dim-witted laps. Along the way they meet a gang of hot lesbian jewel thieves (Eliza Dushku, Shannon Elizabeth and Ali Larter; cranking up the film's already off-the-meter guilty pleasure ratio) and a whole host of celebrities in strange roles.  So many stars walk in and out of frame it seems Smith doesn't quite know where to put everybody or how much screen time any of them should get. He usually decides on `as little as possible'. Smith even gets his camera moving nicely (although I've never complained about his static visual style) with a slick gravity defying jewel heist scene.It's inspired moments like when Jay and SB stumble on the set of Good Will Hunting 2 Hunting Season or Jason Biggs complaining to Dietrich Bader that he is only known as the pie f**ker, that make one laugh so hard we are able to slack Smith's lazy arrogance and the movie's slow plot-driven moments. One thing that truly does hamper the movie beyond forgiveness is Smith's embarrassing mis-use of comic pro Will Ferrell. Otherwise, Smith keeps the pace tight and the gags popping long past when most comedies would have run out of gas and turn into mush towards the third act. Actually, 'Jay and Silent Bob' gets better as it goes. How can I not like a movie that contains a 3rd act montage just for the sake of it where our heroes go door-to-door beating the snot out of every 12 year old punk that said a bad thing about their movie on the internet. Now, that's pure comedy! On a side note...The only way to see this movie is on DVD. God bless it, 'Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back' boasts one of the best deleted scenes ever.

"},{"Title":"Kevin Smith gets 2nd big budget","Date":"2 September 2003","Score":"","Genre":"Comedy","Review":"  This would be my favorite Kevin Smith release, minus Clerks, which is in a league of its own.  This is one big budget laughfest full of cameos, weed references, and dick/fart jokes.  Not for the kids, I must say upfront.  The movie is made up of a journey to get a movie stopped, based on the two characters, Bluntman and Chronic.  Going hand in hand w/Chasing Amy, these characters are based on a comic book written by characters played by Ben Affleck and Jason Lee.  They get consultation fees for the comic book, but are stiffed when the strip makes the big screen.  So our heroes set out on a journey to track down the makers and make them pay.  This movie is full of great one liners and big name cameos.  Some are Matt Damon, Ben Affleck, Carrie Fisher, Mark Hamill, George Carlin, Wes Craven, Shannen Doherty, Gus Van Zant, Chris Rock, Tracey Morgan, Judd Nelson, and so on...Most are people who have either been involved in a former view askew production, or just admirers of this genius comic.  Don't be expecting a big, drawn out plot in this one.  Just expect laugh a minute jokes and antics that you thought you would never hear.  Some include A drug induced ride in the mystery machine w/Scooby and the gang, a mock Star Wars skit including none other than Mark Hamill, and a full out version of Jungle Love by Morris Day and The Time.  Don't feel left out if you don't get all the jokes in this one.  A lot are personal jokes that only the view askew members will catch.  And I must say that you have to see all the Smith movies to get the full effect of this one.  A few of my personal favorite parts are Jason Mewes visioning laying on a bed of ice after his kidneys have been yanked to be sold on the black market, A Smithesque rendition of Mission Impossible, and the ending sequence starring Morris Day and The Time.  Don't miss out on this one.  Very crude but very, very funny.  I rate this one 4/5 for comic brilliance and the fact that it stars Jay and Silent Bob.  And please see the directors cut for the hilarious bonus footage.  You can get the 2 dvd set for like 15 bucks.  Probably the 2nd best Smith film, falling right behind Dogma.

The in-jokes are great and the cameos (even more in the second half) are terrific (especially Matt Damon, Ben Affleck and Jason Biggs).It could of done with less swearing, I don't usually mind swearing but this movie went overboard, you just don't care about them after the first 15 minutes...Nevertheless, what a funny movie. 8/10 "},{"Title":"Hilariously crude mockery/indulge on Hollywood.","Date":"1 August 2003","Score":"","Genre":"Comedy","Review":"  You have to hand it to directors when they bite from the hand that feeds, especially when they do it in such a blunt way. Case in point Robert Altman (The Player). And now avant-garde writer/director Kevin Smith does so with delightful relish. `Jay & Silent Bob Strike Back' is by far the funniest, though not the best, film I've seen in a while. The main characters- Jay & Silent Bob- have featured in all of Smith's movies to date. But the question is, can they carry the film by themselves? The answer is an enthusiastic yes. While it is rib-ticklingly funny, `'Strike Back' is just laughing gas. In past efforts such as `Chasing Amy' and the ingenious `Dogma', there was a tremendous number of crude jokes, but also an emotional core that made it all worthwhile. On the contrary, this movie is done strictly for laughs which makes it good in some respects (no tedious love side plots) but overall doesn't make it match up to previous outings. In fairness, the title is very misleading. With a name like `Jay & Silent Bob Strike Back', this sounds like some grotesque teen sex comedy starring Tara Reid. Instead, this is a very funny, though totally unrealistic, indulge on Hollywood. In order to view the film, you must have seen at least one of Kevin Smith's other movies in order to know what to expect. Plenty of racist/sexist jokes lurk within so this is not one for the easily offended. While some of the jokes are completely over-the-top, films don't come less serious than this. Performances are all okay from a big cast, but the most memorable parts come from the range of cameos. The funniest is Chris Rock's notoriously racist director- Chaka Luther King. Other funny parts go to Carrie Fisher, Mark Hamill, James Van Der Beek, Wes Craven, Jason Biggs, Sean William Scott (going against type, but nonetheless hilarious) and of course Ben Affleck and Matt Damon superbly bickering about their career on the set of `Good Will Hunting 2 Hunting Season'. Several others seem out of place, the best example being Judd Nelson's unfunny police sheriff. This certainly wouldn't win any awards (unless there's a trophy for bravery), but this is crude, rude and blunt entertainment at its best. If you're expecting an epic of cinematic proportions, then look the other way. But if you want some good pointless, superficial fun, then `Jay & Silent Bob Strike Back' is an inauspicious laugh riot. My IMDb rating 6.6/10.

Along the way, they encounter an ape, a nun (Carrie Fisher), the cast of Scooby Doo, a Charlie's Angels style band of sexy women who use them as stool pigeons in a diamond heist, and an unhinged wildlife ranger (Will Ferrell).

Large groups of us used to get together and watch, Clerks, Chasing Amy, and even Mallrats.  When I saw Dogma, however, I became slightly less enamored with the idea of Kevin Smith.  Now, after watching, Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back, I fear that his best work is way behind him.What has always separated Kevin Smith from most other writer/directors is the realism of his dialogue.  You can watch any of the early portion of the New Jersey trilogy and see the characters as slacker everymen who you might know in your own life.  This was even the case with the caricatures of Jay and Silent Bob.In this movie, that realism is completely lost in an attempt to be an over-the-top comedy.  There are very few, if any quotable lines.  It's as if the complaints of becoming too Hollywood that fans voiced after Mallrats have finally come to fruiting in Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back.There are too many cameos (including a dual role for Ben Affleck which should have been kicked to the curb in the editing room) and too much affection for the very Hollywood system that Kevin Smith tries to parody in this movie.  He attempts too hard to distance himself from it, using nudges and winks to the camera when he's trying to be obviously post-modern, but even this comic effect seems stale by about ten minutes into the movie.I'm trying to think of a single truly funny performance and I can't do it. The jokes still come through for die-hard Kevin Smith fans, but this movie has lost the innocence which made Kevin Smith great.  Perhaps the upside is that next time around the studio will cut his budget and he'll have to rely on wit again as opposed to cliches.

It wasn't just some of the mediocre or cliche jokes that weren't funny, or Bob being silent all the time which is getting kind of old(or his acting is), it was the tone of the movie. I had a feeling like I was watching a bad John Hughes family comedy because every time something important would happen or there was a punch line on the way you'd hear that lame musical score that is only suitable for PG movies about monkeys that can talk(whatever). But besides this, if you have even the slightest idea what I'm talking about, the movie provides entertainment. Jason Mewes is his usual self, brilliant and drop dead funny, Seann William Scott and the Affleck/Damon spoof provide some of the funniest moments, there's loads of cameos and Shannon Elisabeth proves yet again why she's the hottest thing in Hollywood.

Everything with Jay & Bob got a little tiresome after only a couple minutes of movie, and I started watching for whatever the next interesting diversion would be. Fortunately, that's one of the things that improves over the course of the movie. Unfortunately, that leaves you with half-hour long stretches of boredom nearer the beginning.That's not to say I didn't leave feeling I enjoyed it, but the second watching wasn't nearly as nice.

This movie starts out very funny and entertaining and from the start you see many classic reappearances, like the athletic trainer who is now a cop. If this movie would have focused more on Jay and Silent Bob's real personal lives and their common dwellings in their small town this movie would have very much rivaled Friday which is one of the best urban comedies of all time. From what you can see from most of this movie it seems like this is mainly a look back at all of Kevin Smith's creations of characters and ideas, along with his hilarious views on other classic icons of pop culture like Scooby Doo and Star Wars. As intelligent and witty as Kevin Smith is, he has a very funny wise ass tone to his films constantly making fun of other bad films and always pointing out constant lame cliches in the film industry yet this film imbodies one of the worst of all. The plots main cliche is the same old 'two buddies stumble and bumble throughout the country , then buddies accidently do something stupid, then the stupid thing they did becomes a huge misconception and now they are on tv and the police and fbi want them, then finally in the end everything gets cleared up and both or one of the buddies gets the girl, and everything is supposed to be ok', geez    that was disappointing!As soon as I noticed the way the plot shifted to a road movie I got a little bored, but I was still very much entertained. The road trip had many dull unfunny parts and also there was a ton of celebs crammed into the movie who were hilarious sometimes, and made you want to fast forward your player at other times. I hope Kevin Smith ignores the bad reviews and gives Jay and Silent Bob another chance, but this time make the film about the real drug dealing J&SB and focus on their hilarious free cheese sandwich eating life style rather than a phony, adventurous, travel the world, type of one. Hopefully Clerks 2 will come to light and we will get more of the real J&SB and not the phony merchandise junk selling ones from the cartoon series either.

So when I watched it I wasn't expecting much. But I found it alright, but it should've been better. The cameos were on the whole very good (particularly the crowd walking out of the movie at the end), and it had some good ideas but it felt kind of flat. Perhaps if it had ended with notes on what happened to all the characters like in Mallrats. After all the movies you'd have thought they could have gone out in style, like in a parody of Butch Cassidy and The Sundance Kid or something like that. But like the ending to Dogma it was kind of a let down. But it could have been much,much worse couldn't it. It was OK but as the finale to the Viewaskewniverse, it was kind of anticlimactic. I can see why he ended it though, noone wants to get labelled so early on. Plus he can always go back if nothing else works out.But I reckon Jersey Girl will work because it does look kind of cool, I heard it described as Smith's Annie Hall, as before Annie Hall Woody Allen had only made a few slapsticky films. It looks to be more mature than his other work although Chasing Amy has its grown up moments. And he hasn't sold out, in Dogma he bought in heavy hitters Alan Rickman, Chris Rock and Salma Hayek, and no one calls that a sell out.

Acting that is less than great, dialog that is just weak and jokes that clank like a broken sink. To me, Smith has always tried to perpetrate this in thing. Like you are either in with what is going on, or you don't get it. Be it Clerks, Mallrats, or Strikes Back, I have never found his movies to be that clever. That is not to say that they are not funny. I loved Clerks and laughed a lot at Jay and Silent Bob. However, I also did groan a lot at a lot of very weak points in this film. Moreover, the female actresses in this film are terrible, but they look good. Which, I guess, is what Smith is all about. He makes films that are nice to look at, but should not be studied.

"},{"Title":"Kevin Smith's worst film, but not totally without merit.","Date":"20 March 2003","Score":"","Genre":"Comedy","Review":"  Kevin Smith has had a pretty varied career in terms of quality product. His first feature Clerks, which is my own personal favourite of his and something that I think he's never matched since, was brilliant because it was razor sharp, superbly written and actually quite insightful. It tapped into a gen-x underside to small town life, made up of people who are too intelligent to waste away their time in low-rent, boring jobs but find that's what they choose to do rather than make the attempt to really better themselves. More than anything it demonstrated that you don't NEED special effects and egotistical A-list stars to make a good movie, you just need raw talent and ingenuity. Mallrats is much more of a fan-boy picture. It's funny, hilarious at times, but the humour felt somehow stretched, as though Kevin had simply been asked to do more of the same on a bigger budgeted, studio outing with better actors. It's really just an escapist, feel good romantic comedy. Chasing Amy on the other hand, made for only about 250,000 dollars, was superb, a funny yet poignant and acutely observed film about contemporary sexuality and relationships. Dogma an interesting failure, good ideas and intelligence let down by excess and sloppy direction.All of which leads you to conclude that Kevin Smith is a genuinely good filmaker, but his talents lie best in writing, and if he must direct, then he should limit himself to low-maintenance, understated indie movies. Give him a huge budget and he tries to cram in too much, too many visuals and too many inconsequential details. He doesn't have any real sense of cinema aesthetics or mise-en-scene which means his films can look badly shot and put together. But he's a very funny guy, with a knack for realistic and erudite dialogue and situations. It's a shame therefore that as far as most people were concerned his major contribution to contemporary cinema was the creation of Jay and Silent Bob. As most people have noted the guys are fine in small amounts, as comic characters designed to temper the more normal people we meet in Kevin's films (lets face it, they could have been left out of Chasing Amy without any major repercussions) but too much of them and we begin to see that they really can't carry 90 minutes of screen time on their own.Not that they're forced to. At least Kevin managed to secure the talents of many quality actors for this film, including cameos from just about everyone who's been in a previous View Askew production Chris Rock, Jason lee, George Carlin, Ben Affleck, Matt Damon, Joey Lauren Adams, Brian O'Halloran, Jeff Anderson, Carmen Lee etc. He even manages to dredge up Carrie Fisher and Mark Hamill for a couple of scenes (Mark Hamill has to have, amusingly, a onscreen caption with his name when he appears, due to the fact that he hasn't done anything noteworthy for about 20 years and is therefore unrecognisable to Star Wars fans). Unfortunatly that's one of the movies most signifigant drawbacks. It's very much an insider film, full of self-referencing and in-jokes from other films by the director, and if you haven't seen these movies then you might be a bit non-plussed at times. Then again, if you haven't seen these movies you're unlikely to be rushing to see this one. People say he made it for the fans, and that's fair enough, but I think the fans deserve better.That's the second problem and probably, now I come to think of it, a more important one the movie isn't actually very funny. Oh it has its moments, it is Kevin Smith after all, but nothing like the volume of quality gags we saw in any of the earlier films. There's an amusing Scooby Doo parody which, to be fair, gets more laughs in about 5 minutes than the recent feature did in an hour and a half. There's Jay's impassioned speech on behalf of the Coalition for the Liberation of Itinerant Treedwellers (geddit?). There's even a very welcome 'Good Will Hunting' sequel 'Hunting Season', and it's nice to see Ben and Matt send themselves up so freely. But a lot of the movie grates. Jay isn't a marvellous character to listen to for over an hour, some of the material is obviously recycled from the comic books (which fans will presumably have read), then there's a lot of redundant dick and fart jokes and profanity just for the sake of being profane i.e. that swearing alone is somehow inherently amusing.It's not a total disaster, and the quickfire approach to the gags means that while little is set up or developed sufficiently to make the jokes really funny, if a line or visual hook falls flat, there'll be another one along in about 15 seconds, so you ought to be able to find something amusing in there. By the way the film, I noticed, came under a lot of fire from certain pressure groups due to accusations of obscenity, homophobia etc, but if you actually watch it you'll realise that it in no way condones anything Jay says; he's like a five year old with tourrettes and it's funny because he has no idea how stupid and offensive he comes off.Flawed, but Kevin Smith is now working on a more mature and intellectualy challenging project, so hopefully this kind of low-brow, juvenile slapstick is behind him now.

It's as simple as that.This was a movie made for the fans.  It was made for people who like locker room humor with a liberal sprinkling of profanity.  It was made for people who use the internet to find out about movies, and to poke fun at those who complain about movies before they're ever released.It is a comedy, and one that utterly fails to take itself seriously at any moment.  The title characters work best in reaction to normal people, and the drift from scene to scene interacting with such characters.

Jason Mewes and director Kevin Smith rehash their roles as the two title characters-one a foulmouthed stringbean and the other a short, stocky dude who doesn't say all that much. Packed with hysterical short almost-Laurel and Hardy-type comedy bits and sly celebrity cameos (plus ample support from Sean William Scott, Shannon Elizabeth, and the incomparable Will Ferrell), Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back is not Kevin Smith's most artistically sound achievement (Chasing Amy or Dogma fits that description), but it is the type of movie that makes you smile when you think about it-an hour and a half of escapism that goes a bit beyond what you were expecting. Recommended.P.S. I have a question-why does it seem, in the movie universe created by this film, that the film Dogma didn't happen? All of Smith's other films from Clerks to Chasing Amy are presented as solid fact in the film world, but at one point you see Matt Damon (playing himself) telling Ben Affleck (playing himself) hey, you convinced me to do 'Dogma'. We know Dogma couldn't just be a movie in Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back's universe because Jay and Bob were both major characters in that film-and we know from Strike Back that they have never been a part of Hollywood. Why is Dogma a work of fiction while all of the other Kevin Smith films are presented as fact in this film?

In fact, Clerks was fantastic, and he's never matched it. Jay & Silent Bob Strike Back has only one or two funny moments in it, and these are delivered by the other stars who make cameos in the film... so go figure. As a parody, Jay & Silent Bob Strike Back doesn't work because most of the parodies fall completely flat, or else are horribly self-indulgent. Chris Rock delivers the funniest line in the film when he says he thought up the idea of Sesame Street first and he called it NWP - Niggas with Puppets. Now THAT was funny, but little else in the movie is, sadly. Definitely a turkey, and I tried to enjoy it because I think Kevin Smith has talent. Too bad he didn't pull it off with Jay & Silent Bob Strike Back, but hey, he can probably make a dick joke about that comment anyway.

Before seeing the movie, there were quite a few actors who I felt would prove to be candidates for this honor (Shannon Elizabeth, Jason Biggs/James Van Der Beek, etc.), but none of them lived up to my expectations. Shannon Elizabeth was actually somewhat endearing as the innocent Justice (not to mention she looked better than she ever had before). James Van Der Beek was Good. Jason Biggs was stupid, but he was supposed to be stupid so it was OK. Will Ferrell, on the other hand, was just terrible. Nothing he said in this movie was funny at all. In fact, the ONLY funny thing he has ever said is It's a frigging hammer! during a Celebrity Jeopardy sketch on Saturday Night Live. Everything he says sounds forced and artificial, which causes it to lose all meaning (if it had any to begin with). Some people think he's amazing because he can say anything with a straight face and not start laughing, but the reason why is because NOTHING HE SAYS IS FUNNY! Don't get me wrong, I love Kevin Smith, and I thought the movie was hilarious (Mewes really DID do a good job), but Will Ferrell is a waste of space.

There are erection jokes. Fart jokes. Sewage jokes. Characters swear and shout. Dozens of celebrities appear to grin and gurn and say look ma! I'm appearing in a hip and trendy film! Some of them get beaten up.Yeah, this is a fun film. Of Smith's four preceding New Jersey movies (Clerks, Mallrats, Chasing Amy and Dogma) its tone is most similar to Mallrats cartoonish action, bright colours and adolescent humour. Like that film, it's rambling and plotless. Unlike that film, it never really stops being entertaining long enough for the audience to notice.Jay and Silent Bob are drug dealers who hang around outside a New Jersey convenience store. In Chasing Amy their likenesses were used in a gross-out comic book for which they wound up recieving royalty payments. On discovering that a film is to be made of the now-defunct comic, they decide to head for Hollywood and stop the movie's production. On the way, they meet a super-intelligent ape being chased by an idiot ranger (a plot recycled from Smith's Chasing Dogma comic book), a band of sexy jewel thieves and virtually every major character from Smith's preceding films.The only problem is that Smith has come to rely too much on fourth-wall bashing and post-modern reference gags rather than on the witty observations and conversations that got him noticed in the first place. Characters from the previous New Jersey movies rely on their catchphrases for cheap laughs even when there's no applicable context (why are we supposed to laugh at the pretzel quote in the comic book shop? Smith knows we watch his films, we know he watches his films. Where's the joke here?) and the look out at the audience joke is used <i>twice</i> for crying out loud. This is the swansong for Smith's NJ movies, so one might expect a little bit of referencing - but does there really have to be this much? Ben Affleck plays about three hundred characters during the couse of this movie - including himself.But I'm being too anal. This is a good, silly movie. If you like Smith's other films then you'll no doubt be renting this. If you haven't seen them it's best to check them out in order. And if you hate them, why are you reading this comment at all?

Some have criticised it for being a no-brainer of a film, no more then a series of stoner and fart jokes. Admittedly, it does contain one of the worst fart jokes ever committed to celluloid but, strangely, it also contains one of the most elaborate! But I can forgive Kevin Smith for opting for the no-brainer option after the heavy subject matter he dealt with in Dogma, as well as the resulting criticism. Also, I have to admit to being quite partial to the occasional dumb-ass comedy!

The constant parody of hollywood and its films might seem to veer away from Kevin Smith's usual movies of other subjects, and parodying films seems to be too enticing subject to do, often being overdone and too easy to make it very simplistic and imitative.

Jay and Silent Bob have only ever had bit parts, and only got a true role in Dogma, and here the jokes keep on flying at constant speed. Its true that many of the films jokes center around gay jokes, but this film was never meant to be offensive, and you have to remember that many jokes like this have been carried through all of Smiths films.The plot, ah yes the plot, is a little thin, but reunites us with many old friends, such as Holden & Brodie. It basicly center's around Jay & Silent Bob finding out that a film is being made about the superhero's that they are the basis for, and worse still, they're not getting the likeness rights they are owned. but it gets worse for the stoners, they then find out that they (or their characters are being bad-mouthed on a internet chat room), so then its off to Hollywood to stop the movie. The plot expands from this point onwards. It gets a little confusing after an hour, and you ask yourself why are they really going to Hollywood, but it all blends together in the end.This really is a good, funny movie.

The reason this film is clever in spite of that, as you wouldexpect from a great dialogue writer and quirky concept writer asSmith is, is that it follows the Mallrats tradition of taking thehomage genre to an innovative place.This movie is not great, even for Smith, but the idea is.  Smithloves to make films that reference the genres he grew up on(Mallrats is his tribute to John Hughes and John Landis), so this issimply his Naked Gun or Hot Shots.  The difference is that,where those movies parodied the popular films of their time, Jay &SB references Smith's own films and the films of his starsexclusively.  That alone makes this film hilarious!

Want to take a shot atthe teen genre as it has progressed since you did it with Mallrats?- Get James Vanderbeek to poke fun at Dawson's Creek!This movie is funny because of the realization of Smith's concept.

Jay (Jason Mewes) and Silent Bob (Smith) discover that a movie is being made from a comic book titled Bluntman and Chronic, from which they were the inspiration for.  In addition to that, there's a lot of trash talking about them on the internet.  So what are they to do?  They decide to go to Hollywood and stop production of the movie and end the online slander.  Along the way, they run into jewel thieves, obnoxious cops, gay jokes, movie references (too many of those), and many (funny) cameo appearances.  Look for George Carlin, Ben Affleck, Matt Damon, Jason Biggs, James Van Der Beek, Shannon Elizabeth, Chris Rock, Alanis Morissette, and Star Wars veterans Carrie Fisher and Mark Hamill.

Half of the jokes seems to revolve around saying the F-word, and the other half is related to jokes about gay people. OK, that's pushing it a bit, but after the often quite intellectual jokes in Dogma, it's a shame that this movie is filled with such a lot of immature humour. The movie also spoofs some well-known movies like Star Wars, ET, the Fugitive, Scream etc. Most of these spoofs aren't very good either, but at least it's fun to look for them. Most interesting part of this movie are the very frequent cameos..Carry Fisher as a nun, Mark Hamill as a super-villain called Cock Knocker, Shannon Doherty (aaaaaaaaaargh) and of course Ben Affleck and Matt Damon.  Overall, I think this movie is watchable, although it's filled with predictable and immature jokes. Looking for spoofs and cameos should keep you busy, and to be fair, there are some very good jokes.

This comparison is probably the main reason that Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back, (JSBSB) fell short of the mark in my opinion. The problem is when people try to frantically push the envelope too hard and end up going from radical to raunch ( a very thin line). Like The Blair Witch Project, JSBSB could have been rated MPAA PG and cut down to 60 minutes if a certain four-letter word was removed. The best line of the film was near the beginning of the film when Jay was upstaged by his lower half and from then on the dialog and plot went downhill. Many of the jokes, in a blatant attempt to shock the audience, were predictable and painful to watch. Not wanting to have a totally bad review, there were some islands of interest in JSBSB. Good Will Hunting 2 Hunting Season, was somewhat funny and Mark Hamill parodying Star Wars was fair. I recommend that people should watch Dogma then JSBSB to experience two extremes of movie quality.

I was worried that would make this movie less funny than if I'd seen all of the View Askew movies.  Luckily, most of the humor in the movie can be understood by anyone.  You just need to know basic info, like the main characters, and a main idea or two, in Clerks, Mallrats, Chasing Amy, and Dogma.  As everybody has mentioned, this is a very vulgar movie.  If you don't like hearing constant vulgarity, then don't watch this movie.  But if you enjoy movies like South Park Bigger, Longer, and Uncut, and you remember the fact that the vulgar language isn't much worse than what you and your friends usually say to each other, then you'll find this movie to be hilarious.  But, it's not just another movie filled with swearing, like Freddy Got Fingered.  Instead, it's a brilliant in-joke of a movie that pays tribute (and parodies) such movies and shows as Land of the Lost, Moonraker, E.T., Good Will Hunting, the Star Wars series (obviously), among many other examples, and filled with countless cameos by well-known faces.  The two leads in the movie are hilarious.  While Jay gets all of the lines, just watching some of Silent Bob's schtick is great, like the subtle joke in the movie of Bob trying to be a gentleman and helping out some ladies, but having little success (after seeing the movie, you'll know what I mean).  The rest of the main actors do an admirable job, and don't mail in their performances.If you are the type who blanches at vulgar language, or are easily offended, then don't watch this movie.  But for the rest of us, you'll get to see a great flick that is fun to watch, doesn't take itself too seriously, and is just entertaining.  By the way, rent the DVD version, because it is filled with extras, and many deleted and changed scenes.

It's not an intelligent story like Kevin Smith's Dogma or a romantic one like Kevin Smith's Chasing Amy (Which are both great movies!), but it's a truly funny, slapstick like comedy full of profanity, stupidity and so on...The two main characters (well the only main characters really) are Jay (portrayed by Jason Mewes) and Silent Bob (portrayed by Kevin Smith). For people who aren't familiar with these two characters I'll try to give a short summary of these characters.Jay and Silent Bob are two stupid stoners who spent their entire lives selling weed in front of a local convenience store in Jersey. Jay talks fast and filthy... and a lot. Silent Bob is... the silent one. He's clearly the smarter one although he is not too smart himself either.The story line (if it needs one) is simple. Jay and Silent Bob find out there is a movie being made about Bluntman and Chronic, two comic heroes who are based on them. The result of this being that people on the internet are badmouthing Jay and Silent Bob because they are... well, stupid. This makes them pretty angry and they decide to go to Holywood to stop this movie from being made.The acting in this movie is pretty good. The main characters (portrayed by Jason Mewes and Kevin Smith) are well played and it surprised me to see that Jason Mewes was able to carry the weight of a complete movie on his shoulders. Kevin Smith played excellent too. The subtlety of his character is just plain funny. There are a lot of great smaller parts too. I especially liked Ben Affleck. By playing the parts he plays in this movie he is showing that he isn't taking himself too serious (which is a good thing, especially for an actor). There are a lot of great cameos in this movie too and they are simply too much too mention but I'll name a few Mark Hamill (in a great Star Wars parody), Carry Fisher (Princess Leia as a nun!) and Jason Biggs (Hey aren't you the guy who f***ed the pie?).It's well directed too and this movie is especially great for Kevin Smith fans. It will recognize all sorts of characters from previous movies and some places too (like seeing the Mooby-restaurants!).All in all this is probably the funniest movie for years.

But I think I would have enjoyed it much much more if I had seen it before any of the other Kevin Smith movies. Clerks and Mallrats were so much better in terms of intellectual humor. I didn't expect much from this movie, but I feel like a little more could have gone into it. I thought that Smith went for way too many cheap laughs. Maybe this is what happens when independent films go mainstream. Dante's repeated I wasn't supposed to be here today. Got old very fast. It looked as though all the repeat characters except Brodie (who I would have liked to have seen more of) became caricatures of their former selves. Dante and Randall really p***ed me off in this one. There were many points such as the We're walking talking bad-girl cliches bit were pure crap. But I loved the Clit master bit. It's sad though, that Jay who even hinted once that he may be a bit on the gay side, would become so homophobic. It also seems as though Jay is always working against Silent Bob rather than working with him. And the references to how much this movie sucked didn't help. All in all, it's best enjoyed by someone who hasn't seen the others and likes cheap gay jokes.

Cameos from Wes Craven, Ben Affleck, Matt Damon, Will Ferrell, Chris Rock and Mark Hamill (amongst others) fits perfectly into the film and give it that little bit of edge over its competition. Shannon 'Nadia' Elizabeth is the eye-candy in this film and is Jay's love interest in this film (Shannon plays Justice, one of the sexy leather clad diamond thieves). There was a lot of controversy over this film, but come on, this is brilliant.

Slowly I discovered the underrated and too-oft maligned genius of Smith. When JSBSB came out, I was hooked for good.  While not the best movie I've ever seen, for its genre it's exceptional - the wit, satire, and of course writing are masterful and ultimately hilarious because all of it is TRUE.  Earlier this week I went to the video store to rent Clerks. At the checkout, the well--er, CLERK (a surfer type with an enviably long, beautiful black ponytail and what appeared to be a lazy eye, but no matter) said,Oh man, are you a Kevin Smith fan? Because this ROCKS. You will so love this. One of his other cohorts, intrigued by our conversation, asked,I've never seen that, is it good? The young man turned to her and with admirable patience said,Ohman, you are SO fired!  How can you work in a video store and never have seen Clerks?!  It quickly devolved into a near-transcendental discussion sprinkled with stream of conscious references to Bruce Lee, Denzel Washington, Spiderman, and Charlton Heston -- and expletives of course. The whole thing was so damn bizarre, I kept waiting for Jay and Silent Bob to roll in.Needless to say, I am now a devotee of Kevin Smith--he's a brilliant talent. So some of the comments here don't exactly agree--to the extent that a few reviewers swear they will never see another Smith movie again--and that's okay. It's not for me to try to convince anyone otherwise. It is what it is.  For my part, I don't plan to miss out on any future ViewAskiew projects--I'd like to watch Smith continue to grow as an artist, offend and delight, be innovative and original, and most of all, never play it safe.  If his work offends or angers people, they're missing the point.  It's not about being above selling out to big Hollywood money, being right, or having to something to prove. It's about telling or better yet SHOWWING it like it is, the human condition, warts and all.  That apparently takes courage in today's uptight, hyper-politically correct if hypocritically moral climate. Don't kill the messenger, ya know? From now on, I will never be able to walk into a video/convenience/record/etc. store, argue with my significant other, hang out in the breakroom and talk about nothing with my friends and coworkers, without sometimes thinking about one of Smith's movies.

But on the way, they encounter everybody and everything from international jewel thieves, an orangutan, and an inept federal wildlife marshall, all in their inevitable quest.The Review Every filmmaker always pours something personal into a film that is small and meaningful. Kevin Smith put his experiences behind the counter in Clerks, and himself with a different name in Chasing Amy, and his views on religion in Dogma, and I have no idea what he put in the unfairly underrated Mallrats but there must've been something. In JASBSB, Smith puts something of major relevance today- the internet with our two protagonists learn that they're the subject of much ridicule from the likes of cruel movie nerds as teenagers and guys who can't even get laid. Smith himself has said that he was angered by comments made by his past films by such anonymous characters. But he gives fair justice to those in an end too good to spoil. Anyway, people say that if you haven't seen any of his previous films, you will not understand the flick, but honestly, Smith's film is a diehard summer flick, with every scene that chooses not to dissect, but to entertain it's viewers. Every part of the film any person could easily walk in on and still be entertained with the exception of any kind of reference to his previous films. Granted you may be thrown off, but Smith's film is an entertaining summer movie meant to be enjoyed and not analyzed unless you're a View Askew fan much like myself. JASBSB is the movie that Jay and Silent Bob finally deserve, with every dick and fart joke that was ever taken from his previous flicks and put to full use here with Smith finally tailoring the humor to his two characters. If you're a View Askew fan, but yet you haven't seen JASBSB, then you clearly need to catch up on your information. There are even references to Smith's cancelled Clerks cartoon series. Very much different from any View Askew film from before, Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back is an entertaining summer flick that is never short on the laughs, and heavy on the cameos (from the likes of anybody ever associated with View Askew to Matt Damon, directors Wes Craven and Gus Van Sant, and practically everybody else).Grade B+ "},{"Title":"A Great way to spend a Sunday afternoon!","Date":"9 June 2002","Score":"","Genre":"Comedy","Review":"  It is 2002 as I write this.

However I was plesently surprised on viewing this. Okay it's more Mallrats than Chasing Amy but Jay and Silent Bob is a Light hearted attack on the Hollywood system. Often the film labels itself as a bad stoner movie as Characters ask who would want to see a bad stoner movie2 and then stare and smile directly into the camera. Jay and Bob stumble their may into Hollywood in order to prevent a bad movie about their comic book alter egos Bluntman and Chronic being made. It's easy to see why critics not fimilar with the Kevin Smith series would want to hate this. Jay is a no brain stoner who flukes his way through life. But Jay and Bobs real appeal comes from performances of Ben Affleck and Jason Lee. Now I wouldn't normally approve of Affleck but he uses Jay and Bob to constuct a parody of himself and the hollywood system. Afflect and Damon pair up for a bloody action sequel to Good Will Hunting (Hunting Sequel) In which he over hears the film crew discussing the previous appearences of Dead hookers in his caravan. He screams out Ah ha! I wasn't even with a Hooker today!. Even Gus Van Saint gets in on the action as the disinterested director of Hunting Season. What an Artist, Afflect and Damon croon.

But I had seen Dogma and liked it immensely, and I was aware of Smith's excellent reputation as an independent film-maker, so my expectations were quite high. However, this film is a disappointment. As the characters themselves admit, it's nothing but a gay joke stretched to movie length. There are a few (but far too few) genuine laughs along the way, and Shannon Elizabeth, Ali Larter and Eliza Dushku are easy on the eyes, but not even the hilarious, self-ironic cameos of stars like Ben Affleck or Jason Biggs can save the film.

All that Smith (writer, director) had to do to attract this demographic was present a trash talking, sex crazed, juvenile delinquent (Jay), along with a quartet of attractive actresses whose only purpose is to arouse all the idiots who look at Jay as their idol.  Oh, I almost forgot all the homosexual jokes.  At one point, (during an argument between Biggs and Van Der Beek) you get the feeling that Smith may be mocking the teenage homophobes out there that use this kind of humor in there day to day lives.  However I don't think they'll realize that they're being mocked. There is also the idiotic references to smoking pot.  Congratulations Kevin Smith - you just expanded your target audience.Am I the only one who got a bit tired of the endless profanity, which was funny for about the first 20 minutes.  It was as if Smith was trying to see how creative he could be in this respect - in between all the f**ks was c**k knocker, ball licker, and s**t eater.And does anyone seriously think it's clever to spoof Star Wars after all these years.What's with that Orangatan.  I guess Smith thought the little ape would be good for back up humor just in case you got tired of Jay talking about how he is the king of clit.  Oh yeah, it also gives Smith an excuse to spoof Planet of the Apes.Before you e-mail me, calling me an uptight loser, let me verify that I did laugh quite a bit during this movie.  There is a spoof in it that most folks probably won't catch.  Will Ferrel is a wildlife marshal that takes over the investigation of Jay & Bob, from the higher powers. I can't stand it in movies when the LAPD argues with the FBI over who is in charge.  Mark Hamil was laughable, if only for a few seconds, as C**k Knocker and Chris Rock was great as a militant, black filmaker.This movie is filled with stupid humor, sometimes intertwined with intelligent humor.  Either way, you will most likely laugh.  It is presented in two confusing ways.  As one big, self-referential joke and as a spoof on Hollywood.  Smith should have put a little more brain time into this so it might have worked better.  However if your looking for more than a few laughs, this movie should do it for you.

Perhaps it's just that I don't particularly like the two characters all that much in leading roles, and they're just better as occasional comic relief, as they do in Clerks, Mallrats, and others.  But mainly I think my hatred for this movie is due to Kevin Smith's strong potential, which he does not use in this movie.  This movie is uninspired, constantly bringing out overdone spoofs of scenes like lightsabre fights in Star Wars and the gutter scene in The Fugitive.  This film also brings out stupid lines and random scenes of extreme stupidity.

He's a wild, manic cartoon character, but actually has the good sense to be an enjoyable character.

Writer-director Smith wants you to believe he has a grudge against Hollywood big budget extravaganzas and he sets his most bankable creations, obscene stoner Jay (Jason Mewes) and his sidekick Silent Bob (Smith), out on a cross-country mission to disrupt a blockbuster being made about comic book characters based on them. But Smith's attention span is somewhat limited and he moves into a middle section about four beautiful jewel thieves who set up the main characters that drags the film down in a hurry. (And the introduction of Will Ferrell as a forest ranger on their trail is just plain bad slapstick.) Once the film gets to California, there are some very funny swipes at the crassness of the product and the large cameo cast is quite willing to poke fun at themselves.

It got some real bad critics and when I watched Chasing Amy, my thoughts on that one wereMan, he learned something from the bad critics and now he's making some REAL movies! He's gonna be the next Woody Allen!. Next came Dogma. When I first saw it, I found it too trashy and maybe Smith is someone that can't handle big loads of money being available. Then I saw it a second time and...yes, it has a lot of good thoughts on religion and there really is a message in it(though it could be some more subtle).It was not as funny as the other ones, but it had a message, some good ideas and I finally found my idea of what the Kevin-Smith-style is in it. Then I REALLY waited on Jay & Silent Bob Strike Back with pleasant anticipation also because I read how many stars would be in it. The movie started pretty nice with the Randall-and-Dante-insider-jokes but then came Jay's a** and fart. I mean this is not classy, this is not funny at all and somehow it's even a little disgusting. Do you remember the chocolate-covered-bretzel-scene in Mallrats? I really hated this scene! Jay & Silent Bob Strike Back has a whole LOTTA these scenes where it is no longer talked in a funny way about those things but some of it is shown or heard and everybody in the audience is(maybe not even aware) torn between being disgusted and laughing out loudly. In my brain either both sides cancel each other off or I'm disgusted. Maybe this works different with YOUR brain... I have no problems with troma films, they are tasteless because they WANT to be tasteless, but Jay & Silent Bob Strike Back is tasteless because it doesn't know where taste ends and tastelessness begins!!! Another example for Jay & Silent Bob Strike Back crossing the line You can't make a L.A. crack-dealer a good ol' friend of Jay! It's CRACK man, no longer weed, CRACK! This is NOT OK!

I know a lot of people prefer his more in depth efforts in Chasing Amy and Dogma, but to me, Smith is a comedian first and foremost, and a message filmmaker second.That said, Smith decided to give his stoner duo top billing for the first time, after having them fill a peripheral role in his other movies. He cooks up a hokey plot device (hey, it's a comedy - who cares about plot?) that sends Jay and Silent Bob off to Hollywood to kill a movie which features their comic book likenesses, Bluntman and Chronic. This, among numerous others, is a reference to a previous Kevin Smith movie. Anyway, along the way, they meet Shannon Elizabeth and her three partners in crime who persuade them to liberate an ape in a test lab as cover for a diamond theft. They end up with the monkey, but not the girls, then proceed to Hollywood with a demented, dim, Federal agent in hot pursuit. In the process, much fun is poked at the movie industry, animal rights nuts, Internet movie geeks, fast food joints, as well as the usual Star Wars references. In this film, Ben Affleck, Matt Damon, Mark Hamill, Wes Craven, Shannen Doherty, and other Hollywood hotshots are willing to put their egos aside and willingly poke fun at their own work. What doesn't work? Chris Rock and his angry black man shtick. Unlike wine, it's not getting better with age. He's a Johnny one note in desperate need of a new tune to play. And George Carlin ceased being funny many years ago. He used to have a cerebral wit, now he's reduced to doing gross-out humor in this film that is decidedly unfunny. What does work? Pretty much everything else. Jason Mewes, to his credit, is able to play the co-lead effectively throughout the entire movie. Smith is solid as his partner. Smith must also be given credit for multi-tasking, i.e., serving as both director and co-star. Shannon Elizabeth positively sizzles. It's not hard to see how Jay falls for her like a ton of bricks. There's tons of in-jokes concerning both Hollywood and previous Kevin Smith movies (it definitely helps to have seen his films in order). In short, this marks Smith's return from the world of issue movies to pure comedy, where, IMHO, he is best suited.8/10 "},{"Title":"Extremely funny.

I've only seen two of his movies, namely his original Clerks film and Dogma and I must be honest, I didn't like either of them that much.  But there was one aspect in both the movies that I thoroughly enjoyed, and that was the characters of Jay and Silent Bob.  There is a very charming stupidity about Jay that is simply hilarious.  He is extremely potty-mouthed, possibly mentally-retarded, and morally bereft, but every single line out of this kid's mouth is pure comedy gold.  I found myself laughing out loud more times than I can count on my fingers and toes.  The Clit Commander home video is reason enough to rent this movie.  Now that I've finally fallen in love with Smith's View Askew galaxy, I am so sad to see them go.  But I guess this was definitely a superb swan song for the entire cast of characters.. I also REALLY enjoyed Will Ferrell's performance in this movie.  Will Ferrell is a comedic genius, and I've felt that way since his first season on Saturday Night Live.  He has the unique ability to improv the absolute funniest lines, and this shows through if you watch the bonus material from Jay and Silent Bob and another recent, but not as funny, movie with Ferrell -- Zoolander.  Mark my words, there will be big things to come for Will Ferrell, and I can't wait to see what he he's going to do next. Some of the things I did NOT like about the movie1.) The acknowledgements of the clever, little inside jokes.  They really didn't have to turn to the camera and wiggle their eyebrows knowingly for the audience to get it.  If you didn't get it, then you're not going to get it regardless of the acknowledgement.2.) Kevin Smith's interpretation of Silent Bob in this film was way over the top and bordering on hammy.  Too many emphatic facial gestures and stuff.  Didn't need it. 3.) Ben Affleck is so lame.But thats it, I was willing to overlook all of the flaws of this movie, because of the large helping of Jay's hilarity, which trumps everything.  I must warn you that this movie is extremely trashy, and if you are the type that cringes every time someone utters the f-word or the s-word, then I would suggest looking elsewhere such as Harry Potter or a Disney animation.

Watch out for the hot looking ladies, you can't miss them!The direction is pretty good, this is Smith's biggest film to date and he does take care of things very well here.Jay and Silent Bob is fun, forget the plot, it's not important. Just enjoy the adventure. "},{"Title":"Good, not as good as Clerks","Date":"23 March 2002","Score":"","Genre":"Comedy","Review":"  I would have to agree with others that this film was a good laugh.  There were a few times where it was funny, but I think nearing the end half of the movie most of the jokes became a bit dull and routine.  Also, something annoyed me with the sound effects and other aesthetic details to the filming.  It's funny, but a movie like Clerks which had NO budget at all stands out in comparison to this one.  The main thing I noticed most about this movie was lack of good ideas or dialogue in the second half.  Clerks had some great dialogue, and sheer zaniness which worked because it was subtle yet, at the same time, completely outrageous.  Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back could have been better, but really, how long can the stoner duo retain their freshness on celluloid?  I would rate this film a 7/10.  Pretty funny, worth seeing, not as good as the original.Oh, and I agree with Ben Stiller that Greedo shooting first was the worst idea in film history.  George Lucas?  What hit you on the head?

I showed the first 10 minutes of the film to my mom and she was shocked. If you like juvenile humor, see this movie. There really are no redeeming factors in this movie -- short of Smith's talent as a writer and director -- but it's an all out comedy it doesn't need any redeeming qualities.So long as you keep in mind this movie doesn't even take itself seriously and it's all in fun, and you're not easily offended, you can enjoy this movie.

My favorites are Mallrats (in the category of pure but better-honed fun and silliness) and Chasing Amy (in the category of The sort of films Kevin Smith would make if he were grown up).  Clerks is good as a first film, but too much a first film.  Dogma would have been better as a Chris Rock standup routine, which it basically was, but Smith billed it as a movie, so he had to stick in a bunch of scenes and characters and so on to pull off the con.To say goodbye to all the characters in the Askewinverse, especially Jay and Bob, in one goofy film, is perfectly kosher with me.  And given the main/title characters, we shouldn't expect anything with gravitas.  And the movie is funny.  It's just not as funny when this material was fresh.Should we really be surprised?  The film feels like the homage that it is, and a self-absorbed homage (both because Jay and Bob are self-absorbed, but because Smith himself seems to have been driven to adopt the same persona--maybe indicating his reason for ending the Jersey Chronicles). Jay and Bob go to Hollywood to stop their movie NOT because they weren't given a cut of the proceeds, but because they are incensed by the internet chatroom and BBS posters making fun of...Jay and Bob.  That's wholly in character for our dynamic duo (to care more about the opinions of pimply nobodies on the WWW than about their foregone riches), but as a plot device, it seems as much about Smith's own frustration toward the 'net's movie reviewers as it is a plausible course for Jay and Bob.The inside jokes referencing Smith cast members and their careers are the funniest elements, meaning that the movie can't be as successful if you haven't spent significant time in the Askewniverse.  The cameos only reiterate the feeling of self-absorption--Smith has enlisted all his old pals in this masturbatory fantasy.  Masturbation is all good and well, but it supports a finite number of jokes, and it's really not long sustainable as a spectator sport.  Smith's movies start with Clerks (a movie he got to make), then to Mallrats (a movie he made right for the genre), then to Amy (a movie of quality that stands on its own), and then to Dogma and J&SBSB (movies he made just because he could).  Gratuitous.Smith seems to have rejected the idea that his filmmaking should grow and opted instead to seal it off in a time-capsule.  Certainly that's his prerogative--I understand that he doesn't conceive of himself as a filmmaker, at least not simply as a filmmaker--but he showed enough talent with words and ideas that it would have been nice to see where he ended up. "},{"Title":"Sometimes, a movie this offensive has to be made (and that is always)","Date":"16 March 2002","Score":"","Genre":"Comedy","Review":"  You might say of Kevin Smith that he is a stoner, comic book geek that was blessed into being allowed to write and direct his own films, riding on the coattails of his first film Clerks and his much more famous friends Matt Damon and Ben Affleck.  He puts out the most vile and sophomoric films that are made with the sole purpose of getting high schoolers to laugh at pubic hair and weed jokes.  You might say that he needs to take off that raggy hooded jacket and get away from anything resembling a camera.  You might say he is just not funny.  I, however, might say I think he is a comedy mastermind. (And I do.)In Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back we find the ultra-baked duo setting out to Hollywood to defend their good (?) names after being repeatedly slammed on an internet movie guide (kind of like this one, just not for the whole family) after a movie is set to be made of in their image.  Along the way they hitch a ride with a sexy group of diamond thieves who set them up for an orangutan kidnapping and they cross paths with characters played by some of the finest comedy people of all time. (George Carlin, Wil Ferrel, Jon Stewart, Chris Rock, etc.)That's about the long short of the the plot. (it really is.)  This, however, allows Smith to not only satire his own films, but everthing else Hollywood. And most of the fun is poked at decent films!  For example, Matt Damon, Ben Affleck, and director Gus Van Sant doing a quick poke at Good Will Hunting, (a very outstanding film,) when Jay and Silent Bob stumble upon the filming of Good Will Hunting 2, Hunting Season.  They not only take stabs at the movie, but at each other's fame.  (Grip on bullhorn to set extras if you make any eye contact with Mr. Damon or Mr. Affleck, you will be fired!)  And, yes there is the Star Wars rips, too.  (Keep an eye open for Mark Hamill and Carrie Fisher cameos.)  Satires of Hollywood is exactly the kind of thing we need more of, trust me.So you must understand, Mr. Smith was not out to create an intellectual movie here.  Of coarse it's beyond silly.  This is his most slapstick and profanity-filled film to date... and I for one enjoyed every minute of it. As soon as the movie begun, I found myself laughing with tenth-grader glee until the end, all the while my wife looked on in shame, yet trying not to laugh, herself.  I felt no guilt in this nor did I feel that I should have spent my time watching some smart arthouse film like Waking Life or something.  (Hey, you're talking to a longtime fan of Bevis and Butthead here!)I watch the subtle brilliance of Kevin Smith and have always recommended his movies to friends.  Plus, the DVD came with a bonus disc were you may watch deleted scenes(some kept out to miss a NC-17 rating)with introductions by Smith and others.  I dug this too, as it left me with a more personal touch on the film.  Kevin Smith never comes off as some misunderstood genius who belongs to some kind of higher order like alot of directors. (Tim Burton?) I saw him and Jason Mewes as guys who like movies and like making movies. They came off as if they were talking to me directly, as if I might have even been hanging out with them.  Now, alot of you complained but I propose quite simply this movie wasn't for you.  And I bet all the complainers normally like fart and sex jokes any other time.  And if that's the case, go rent the foul and unfunny There's Someting About Mary and leave the good times to people like Kevin Smith and us.Seth's Rating A-P.S.

And it's sad to think that it's the last one. It still amazes me that after all four movies, the jokes are still hilarious and the cast is still superb, along with the screenplay that never really lets up. Kevin Smith, writer-director-star, pretty much does quadruple time on this film, since he is in just about every scene. Plus, he even makes one of the boldest decisions anybody has ever made. He moves Jay and Silent Bob out of New Jersey and into Hollywood. In this movie, his Silent Bob character pretty much talks as much as he did in Chasing Amy. Also, how could there be a Silent Bob movie without Jay, who never stops talking throughout the entire film. Not that it's a bad thing. But the best thing about this movie is the way they connect all the previous View Askew movies. Smith ties in all the characters we have previously met, and puts them in the movie in which they are all essential to the plot. (Excluding Dogma, where most of the characters couldn't be in this movie for obvious reasons. Although there is a reference or two to Dogma) Anyway, Smith does a magnificent job tying in the other movies, knowing exactly when and where to put them in. Also, a lot of the cast does double duty in this playing characters from the other View Askew movies. For example, Jason Lee plays Brodie and Banky. Ben Affleck plays Holden and well, Ben Affleck. And there is also a plethora of cameo appearances in this film. Including Chris Rock, George Carlin, Matt Damon, Judd Nelson, Wes Craven, and dozens of others.

Therefore, I laughed my ass of at Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back. These characters are rock solid comic cornerstones the slapstick pair, one is smart, one is not. Evidence Laurel and Hardy, Abbot and Costello, Martin and Lewis, Fred and Barney, the list goes on. So from that standpoint, the movie should have no problems, provided the plot works, which this one does, and well. Jay and Bob are slapped with a restraining order keeping them away from the Quickstop. Where to now? On a trek across the country to L.A. to keep a movie about characters based on Jay and Silent Bob from being made. Simple enough, right? Well, Smith's brilliant writing keeps this from being anything but simple. There are more cameos in this movie than ever, and the inside jokes about Hollywood, Miramax, Ben Affleck and Matt Damon, as well as walk ons by every other character from Kevin Smith's View Askew-niverse, this script is absolutly dripping with clever wit. The tie ins with Star Wars are always held in high favor (yes, I am a fanboy). And as always, I can never watch Jay's scathing insults to anyone or anything without busting a gut. Great supporting parts by Will Ferrell, and one liners by every cameo celebrity keep this one a laugh riot until the very end. I do admit, however, that this movie is not going to be for everyone. I can see how some people can be offended by such constant profanity, sexual vulgarity, and drug references. That is fine. Those people have thier own movies that they can cling to, and the world is a happy place. (Frankly, I hate the movies those people watch. Ever see Magnolia? Man! What a hot steaming pile of peanut encrusted crap cleverly disguised as a movie! But I digress.) In conclusion, if you like lots of profanity, vulgarity, and razor sharp inside humour, watch Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back. Also, get this one on DVD if possible. It is absolutely loaded to the gills with outtakes, deleted scenes, trailers, videos, etc,etc,etc, all introduced by Kevin Smith, Jason Mewes, and a handful of others from Kevin Smiths world.

The movie actually gets better as it progresses and many of the cameos are hilarious in and of themselves...but wasn't thrilled with the acting from Affleck, Damon, or Lee -- whose acting seem stilted and too self-conscious (maybe they didn't read the script ahead of time either) -- charges I can't level at Mewes or Smith.  I wasn't offended by the anti-gay parody/slurs, though I do wonder what Kevin Smith was thinking as he wrote this stuff.  I mean, this material is getting a bit tired but it worked 90% of the time in this film. In summary  Lots better than expected and even better if you're familiar with Kevin Smith's other films, esp.

After all of the New Jersey Triology references we were taken on a nonsensical ride that had a few laughs but lacked the true Kevin Smith flare. The cameos were also neat but with the plot they really couldn't add too much. I think this movie dropped the ball when the whole diamond heist subplot was introduced. If Smith had kept this movie as a Hollywood satire and an homage to himself I would have been a lot more satisfied. Clerks was innovative, Mallrats was mediocre, Chasing Amy was genius, Dogma was edgy, and J&SBSB is decent. As you can tell this ranks last on my Kevin Smith List (1. Chasing Amy 2. Dogma 3.

Those who enjoy dick and fart jokes and those who appreciate his true wit and talent. The former think that Mallrats was genius and think that J&SBSB is right up there. The latter feel that Smith hit his creative peek with Chasing Amy and followed up with Dogma. I am one of the latter. Chasing Amy had some of the best dialogue ever written and acted with some of the most brilliant performances. Kevin Smith made a love story that trancends all love stories because it was honest and real. Any other love story would have had the boy get the girl, but not Chasing Amy. Dogma had some more of his effective dialogue and equally great performances. Then we get a movie like Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back. This movie hurts Kevin Smith more than it helps him because it drops him back down to the lowbrow level that he achieved with Mallrats (a movie that has been blasted by critics till this day). I like Kevin Smith, he's a genius. But I would have liked a better send off than this movie.

He has done, for 5th time, an incredible job with Jay & Silent Bob Strike Back, his last creation and the funniest in my opinion.Focusing on the film, JSBSB centers the action in Jay and Silent Bob at all time, different from the previous View Askew productions (Clerks, Mallrats, Chasing Amy, Dogma). In the other films, they appeared occasionally, but not as the main characters. Luckily, they made an excellent job, both Jason Mewes and Kevin Smith. Before commenting the plot, I suggest you to see ALL THE 4 PREVIOUS FILMS BEFORE GOING TO THE THEATERS, because there're lots of funny references from the other productions that you wouldn't like to miss. Let's see the plot briefly Jay & Silent Bob hear that there's a movie going to be made based on Bluntman & Chronic, the comic book based on them ) So they decide to go to Hollywood to stop the production of the film, in order to save their good names.Kevin Smith has used JSBSB to remember all the characters appeared in the other films. It appears Dante Hicks and Randal Graves from Clerks; Brodie from Mallrats; Holden McNeil, Banky Edwards and Alyssa Jones from Chasing Amy and many many others. Very talented people to create a brilliant film. You should see it as if you were reading a comic. You'll find lots of hilarious characters, incredibly funny situations, and beautiful girls too!

I liked them all, but they've gotta be in an order-- and this one's #5, any way you slice it.What we'd all like to see, whether we admit it or not, is for Kevin Smith to write one of his trademark witty, dialogue-driven scripts, and hand it off to a more experienced director with more visual flair.  J&SB was just giving the audience what it wanted to see.And there's nothing wrong with that.  I'm just more interested in what SMITH wants to see.  This one looks and feels like the script was written in 20 minutes, and then the studio threw money at it.  It's funny, but humor fades, and all that's left behind is substance-- of which this movie has much less than any one of Smith's previous movies.Still, like the inferior Return of the Jedi, the series is incomplete without it.

It was so funny I saw it three times in the theaters all in 2 weeks. The characters of Jay and Bob deserve their own movie, because they have been the added bonus of Kevin Smith's previous 4 films. Jason Mewes shows his great talent for comedy and really brings Jay to life. Every class in high school has one of those kids who is vulgar as anything, and not afraid to say whatever he's thinking at any moment, that is Jay in a nutshell. Line after line of his vulgar, sexist, New Jersey dialog was hilarious. And Silent Bob was there to bring hilarious silent comedy to the table. The film also makes a great satire of Hollywood, and brings the entire View Askew universe together. My only complaint, other than Will Ferrel, is that this is the last movie we will be seeing with Jay & Bob in it, right when we can all revel in what glorious characters they are.

As with most Kevin Smith movies, there no subtext or subtlety here; what you see is what you get.  If you're seeing deeper messages, you're deluding yourself.  The one possible exception is Chris Rock's rampantly racist performance, which *might* be intended to be so overblown as to be pastiche.  But placed in the context of his previous performances, and the single mindedness of Jay, it's genuinely hard to tell.So, given that there's no hidden depths, is this film funny enough to be enjoyed as pure entertainment?Well... maybe.  It largely depends on the viewer.For a start, you have to be able to empathise with the utterly amoral and misogynistic Jay and Silent Bob, which kind of presupposes that you are a guy.  Let's make this clear, the women in this film are there only to be mentally undressed by Jay, Silent Bob and the audience.  Sure, Kevin makes capital from this by pointing it out, but it doesn't make it less true; this is a guy's film.Then there's Jay himself.  Jason Mewes is outstanding in the role and carries the movie, but the strength of Jay in Kevin's previous films is that he's a disjoint, a break from the norm.  The relentless Jay-isms here can grow a little tired, even though Mewes manages to find ever more explosive ways to ejaculate his expletives.And some scenes just fall flat and are completely predictable.  Again, Kevin tries to turn this into a positive by involving the audience in the joke, but he does it two or three times too many.  Kevin, we GET it, you don't have to beat us over the head with it every time.On balance, I loved Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back - because I saw it for free and on my own.  If I'd seen it in a cinema with friends who might not have thrown themselves into it as whole heartedly, I think that it would have been a disappointing and awkward experience.

In Mallrats, he showed much improvement, but I still wasn't terribly impressed.  In Strike Back, his acting was light years ahead of where I ever would have expected it to be. Much of his role was physical comedy, and I thought he did a spectacular job.  He was the reason this movie was so funny. Ben Affleck was very funny in his role of Holden McNeil (from Chasing Amy), and, despite the many people who have disagreed with me on this, I thought that Will Ferrell was funny, also (someone said he was this movie's equivalent of Jar Jar Binks).

This film is the culmination of all of the previous, using jokes and every major character from these films.  This one is, by far, the most hilarious of them all.  The film begins when Jay and Silent Bob are on the curb of their convenience store hangout, and gives the origin of them being there.  Jay (Jason Mewes) spews profanity from birth and Silent Bob (Kevin Smith) earns his name.  This segues into a bit where the main characters are briefed on a comic that was sold on the idea of them as superheroes.  It was then sold for movie rights, unbeknownst to them. Therefore, they must stop the movie from being made.The rest of the film deals with oral sex on nuns, a comically inept wildlife agent (Will Ferrell), a monkey who beats the stuffing out of James Van Der Beek and Jason Biggs, and a laser sword fight between Jay and Mark Hamill.  Needless to say, all of this is woven into ridiculously crass jokes about various sexual positions, the distribution of marijuana, and Charlie's Angels parodies.  What makes the movie truly hilarious is Mewes' performance.  He carries the movie like he should have in all of the previous, and makes it worth the $8.00.  His sexual jokes are laced with unexpected wit, and lets Smith lay in the background as the hood ornament he was meant to be.  This is an absolutely phenomenal movie.  Watch this one today!

I can only think of three excellent movies that have been released this summer.  First is Steven Spielberg's dark underrated classic A.I. a movie that has much more depth than people believe.  Second is Tim Burton's PLANET OF THE APES which did a good job retelling the 1968 classic with Burton giving his usual style to the tale. Now Kevin Smith does his part by adding JAY & SILENT BOB STRIKE BACK to the small list of excellent films that were released this summer. I've seen JAY & SILENT BOB three times already being that I am a Kevin Smith fan and that it's so darn funny!  But, be aware, in order to get a real kick out of this film you MUST see Smith's other works first (CLERKS, MALLRATS, CHASING AMY, & DOGMA), since this film has connections to Smith's previous films.  Quick Stop regulars Jay and Silent Bob (Jason Mewes and Kevin Smith) are given a restraining order from the Quick Stop after Randall and Dante (Jason Anderson and Brian o' Hollaran from CLERKS) are tired of Jay and Bob selling dope in front of the stores.  So when Jay and Bob now hang out at their friend's Brodie (Jason Lee from MALLRATS) Brodie tells Jay and Bob that they should have a lot of money since a movie about comic characters Bluntman and Chronic (which were based on Jay and Bob) is being made, and they should get likeness royalties.  Jay and Bob are upset since they haven't gotten a red cent, so they visit Bluntman and Chronic creator Holden (Ben Affleck from CHASING AMY) and want their money.  Holden tells them that he sold the comic rights to his partner Banky (also Jason Lee from CHASING AMY) and has no control over the comic.  But what gets Jay and Bob upset (especially Jay) is that computer internet geeks have been saying bad things about the two of them.  So Jay and Silent Bob head off to Hollywood to stop the film from being made so these internet *%&$ can stop saying anything else bad about them.  While on their way, Jay and Bob meet a quartet or international jewel thieves Sissy (Eliza Dushku), Chrissy (Ali Larter), Missy (Jennifer Schwalbach Smith) and Justice (Shannon Elizabeth). Of the four, only Justice is the friendly one to Jay and Bob, causing Jay to fall in love with her.  Jay would do anything for Justice, including stealing a monkey with Deputy Wildlife Marshall Willenholly (Will Ferrall) after them.  From there on is one funny scene after another until the credtis are over. I would place this movie along with such comic classics as STRIPES, GHOSTBUSTERS, TRADING PLACES, ANIMAL HOUSE, and VACATION.  It's a movie that you can watch over and over and laugh just as much the eighth time watching it as you did the first.  The jokes are witty, clever, and very very funny! And the film does a excellent job building up the laughter that the last thirty minutes are hysterical as Jay and Bob wander the studio backlot of Miramax Studios. People for the next few months will argue and debate on which Kevin Smith film is the best CHASING AMY or JAY & SILENT BOB STRIKE BACK.  I would lean more towards this film since it's faster, funnier, and more exciting.  I still enjoy CHASING AMY, but as a romantic-comedy, JAY & SILENT BOB is a excellent comedy, flat-out comedy, nothing more, nothing less. Smith does a brilliant job adding in jokes from his previous films (such as having character cameos from Smith's previous films) as well as other popular films (GOOD WILL HUNTING 2 HUNTING SEASON is one of the film's highlights).  And for this, this will have the audience entertained throughout the film.  And the acting is also good,  Jason Mewes does a very good job as dim-witted, foul mouth Jay.  Mewes is energetic and always very obscene yet funny, unlike other comedians Mewes uses his profanity with humor.  And Smith also does a great job with his facial reactions and gestures using the comic talent that Buster Keaton and Charles Chaplin used in the silent-era. One more thing, the international jewel thieves are very very sexy! When watching the film, all three times, the male hormones rose as the theater got very very steamy.  Seeing four sexy females in skin-tight leather outfits make the women from last years CHARLIE'S ANGELS look dull and plain.  Plus their screen time which is about 40% of the film is better than all of CHARLIE'S ANGELS. This is a comedy that is funny, but not for everyone.  Those who enjoyed AMERICAN PIE, THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT MARY, even ANIMAL HOUSE, STRIPES, MALLRATS and THE SIMPSONS will find this movie to be very funny and one of the best films this year.  But for those phonies out there who prefer to watch comedy from NBC must see Thursdays, MISS CONGENALITY, RUNAWAY BRIDE, AMERICAN SWEETHEARTS, CHOCOLATE, and other touchy and sappy feel good movies will hate this movie with a passion.  I get around five to ten people a day complain how many times does the F-word have to be said in this film? Well the people need to relize that is Smith's style.  Every director has a unique style and direction (that is why they direct big budget films). And Kevin Smith style is the reality talk with profanity mixed into it. I just hope Jay and Silent Bob are reading this, because if they are this is what I would like to say to them THANK YOU DUDES VERY MUCH!

Don't expect anything more profound than Up In Smoke or Clueless - this is just good ol' fashioned silly fun (age appropriate unfortunately, due to Jay's foul mouth).

Smith creates a comedy full of obscenities, full of sex jokes, and full of underground movie hints. And still, it's a COMEDY in the sense of the word created by Monty Python, Mel Brooks, and recently by the Farelli brothers. I must say I haven't enjoyed myself in such a way since i saw Airplane! (and that was a long time ago). The numerous appearances by gods in the business (George Carlin, Chris Rock, and Smith himself) make this movie even more worthwhile.However, Jay and Silent Bob... is an example of a comedy with an age limit no one under 17 and no one over 27. That's what creates Smith's problem. Almost every critic that rated this comedy ranged in the ages 40-60 and those people see things in a rather different way (not necessarily bad but different). That is why you may find reviews that give that movie one star out of five. Please, don't become biased and see Smith's piece for yourself. In the age limit, it's a masterpiece, over the age limit, it's anything from back when i was a kid to What the f*** is he trying to say.That's what makes Smith brilliant his never-ending ability to make controversy.

This movie was great to anyone who loves Kevin Smith films and who understands Jay and Silent Bob. Jay and Silent Bob, or Jay in particular, represent the guys in life who have high school way past them in years, but still want to go back. This is the dilemma for the guys in the movies in Clerks, Mallrats, and Chasing Amy. All these guys were in need of growing up, but they couldn't, they wanted to stay in the past. But as so many years go by, they are forced to grow up...leaving the only two males in the Askewniverse who haven't...Jay and Silent Bob. So in the last chapter of the Askewniverse, we are forced to see how Jay and Silent Bob handle the real world. And they can't. They are like a pair of junior high kids stuck in a thirty year old's body. They make fart jokes, offend people, and say what is on their mind because they don't know any better. Or any worse? They speak their minds and they don't care about the consequences. That is why Jay and Silent Bob are celebrated. Why the characters in Chasing Amy made them into comic book characters. The reason Kevin Smith focused on them for once is because they are the last children of the Askewniverse. So, Jay and Silent Bob head off to Hollywood because some kids on the internet are dissing their comic book and soon-to-be movie alter egos Bluntman and Chronic. As they head off to Hollywood, they steal a orangatan named Suzanne. But really, they were scape goats for a jewel heist. Anywho...unlike the male characters of Clerks, Mallrats, and Chasing Amy they don't have a catharsis where they learn for the worst. They just become famous because they haven't any concerns. They don't need to learn about life, they have their own unique grasp of it. Besides, aren't they the ones offering the guys advice in the previously mentioned movies? Well, this is how I see Jay and Silent Bob. Maybe I thought about it too hard and developed this analyzation of them. But I think they're wonderful. This movie is wonderful.

It was very well-written, and it was like one joke after another. Most of the gags rallied against the entertainment industry, but it was enjoyable nonetheless.

"},{"Title":"Funny...in parts","Date":"7 September 2001","Score":"","Genre":"Comedy","Review":"  I thought the main problem with this movie is that it seemed like there was a lot of filler.  Unlike Mallrats, there is no plot driving this movie -- instead, it is essentially Jay (Jason Mewes) who carries the film through. If you've seen any other films with Jay and Silent Bob, you know that they are extremely one-dimensional, one-line comic relief.  Well, Kevin Smith did his best trying to make that one joke funny for an entire movie...unfortunately, it just didn't make it IMO.  Most of the movie are fairly stupid gay jokes or piss'n'fart style comedy.  This style of comedy has become extremely popular recently, and while some of the jokes used here were funny, most of it was just plain stupid.  Yeah, people will laugh at the stupid stuff if that's your thing, but if you're used to the clever comedy of Clerks, Mallrats, and Dogma, this movie just doesn't have the stuff.  There are some really, really funny scenes in the movie (Good Will Hunting 2, the Mark Hamill fight scene, even the Charlie's Angels rip-off scenes), and that's what made this movie so frustrating for me.  Kevin Smith has a brilliant sense of humor, but for this film he wanted to make a Jay and Silent Bob movie, the antithesis of all his other films.  Well, he certainly accomplished creating a movie fitting for the title characters, but there's no way it holds its own against the far more witty and intelligent comedies he's known for.  5/10 "},{"Title":"Get a life, and you might get this movie","Date":"7 September 2001","Score":"","Genre":"Comedy","Review":" For the couple of reviewers who did not stay till the end of the credits, roughly a minute after her name appears in the cast list, THAT is where you will see view askew's God.  And that is not a spoiler in any way, just a bonus.The logic works like this  if you look at the title and you think who are Jay and Silent Bob? you shouldn't see the movie.  There is a chance you might still find it funny, but you'll be on the outside of an inside joke.  If you like Richard Roeper's review style and you think he is just as valid a critic as the late Gene Siskel, then you don't have to see this movie.  Roeper didn't like it.  He was very upset by Jay's profanity and his attitude.  Ebert, however, got the movie and liked it.Before hurrying out and renting the prerequisite movies Star Wars, Good Will Hunting, Clerks, Mall Rats, Chasing Amy, Dogma and maybe ten seconds of Scream 3, take some time to look around and enjoy life and explore pop culture in general so you won't wend up sounding like some of the twerps who have posted astoundingly irrelevant comments here.The world of the film is weird, and reality is the straight man.

But, most people who want to see a comedy movie, care nothing of plot.  This explains past movies such as Scary Movie, American Pie, Hot Shots, the National Lampoon series, Monty Python etc...  Usually, intense comedy gets in the way of any kind of a plot.This movie kind of ties up Kevin Smith's entire series of movies, so being a big Kevin Smith fan, I'll give you a brief description of the others, in orderClerks One guy works at a convenient store, the other works at a neighboring video rental store.  They get bored at work and end up hanging out together and talking, even playing street hockey on the roof of the convenient store.  Very dialogue intensive, lots of gags, absolutely no plot to speak of, don't watch this one if you have no attention span.  (Jay and Silent Bob are drug dealers that hang out in front of the convenient store in this flick)Mallrats Two guys get dumped by their girlfriends, and decide to go to the mall.  One guy finds out that his girl is participating in a dating game show being filmed at the mall, and wants to put an end to it.  He finds the troublemakers (Jay and Silent Bob) in the mall, and assigns them the task of ruining the game show, so he can get his girl back.  Decent plot, lots of humor...this and Dogma are tied to be my favorite.Chasing Amy This movie doesn't truly fit in to the series very well, other than its obsession with comic books.  It has a very good plot, but is low on the comedy bits.  This movie is typically a big disappointment to most Smith fans.  As for the plot, basically a guy falls in love with a girl, then finds out she's a lesbo.  The highlight of the movie is when the heartbroken guy turns to Jay and Silent Bob for advice, if you laugh at this movie, it will most likely be during this scene.Dogma This movie is very plot intensive, and is hands-down Smith's funniest movie ever.  Basically two fallen angels find out a loophole in the Catholic dogma that allows them to get back into heaven.  God decides to send his top angel down to earth and get a woman to stop these bad dudes.  This woman somehow gets help from two guys (Jay and Silent Bob) despite Jay's constant attempts to get into her pants.  This movie moves very fast, and if you don't pay attention, you may get lost in all the commotion.  This movie may take 3-4 viewings before you get all of the jokes, and truly understand everything going on in the plot.  Yes, it's that intricate.I love movies that make you think, and Kevin Smith's movies are famous for that.  Jay And Silent Bob Strike Back isn't as intensive in that aspect in some ways, but in other ways, it's even more so.  It has lots of cameos, and references to other movies.  A lot of famous people make cameos on the movie, reference their own movie in some way, and make fun of it.  For example, there is a part where Ben Affleck is playing a character who refers to Ben Affleck as an actor.  Who knows how many people that joke slipped by, because they didn't recognize that person was, in fact, Ben Affleck. That's the whole thing about Kevin Smith movies.  You have to be quick witted, and be able to catch jokes without having them spelled out to you.  Anybody can laugh at Mr. Bean when he accidentally stuffs his head into a turkey, but to catch all of the jokes in a Kevin Smith movie, that takes some intelligence.So, to sum it up, if you see this movie, and don't think it's funny... You're stupid.  Try doing some studying, then watch it again, you imbecile.

Kevin Smith","Date":"2 September 2001","Score":"","Genre":"Comedy","Review":"  There's a running gag in Kevin Smith's new film in which the director pokes fun at people who go on the internet and criticize his movies. At first, it's funny, but then, as Smith returns to the bit over and over, he seems to reveal himself as a tad obsessive. It's as if he has a problem with anyone using this new medium of free expression to do anything but praise his movies. So, Kevin, I hope you're reading this...Ever since his first ultra low-budget breakthrough, Clerks, I've recognized a great filmmaker inside Kevin Smith, a great filmmaker who's constantly being stifled by his own immature tendency toward self-indulgence. It's a fault that is best personified in each of his films by the recurring characters of Jay and Silent Bob, played by Jason Mewes and -- speaking of self-indulgence -- Smith himself.These two stoners, never have much to offer and each of their appearances have generally detracted from Smith's efforts. In Dogma, for example, the pair's vaguely Wayne-and-Garthish act largely took away from what was otherwise a clever, interesting take on a serious subject. When that movie came out, I complained the duo were a habit Smith needed to grow out of. Instead of growing beyond the characters, he's now gone and devoted an entire film to them.The movie is Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back, and Smith claims it's the last of his Askewniverse movies -- the Askewniverse being the ever-growing cadre of New Jersey-based characters around whom all of his films have revolved. But in fact, let's hope it's the last we see of Smith's aforementioned self-absorbtion. If it is the end, then it's only because he's overdosed this time.The tagline on the poster may suggest this is a comedy about Hollywood, but it's really a movie about Smith himself. The plot sends our weed enthusiasts west to Tinsletown in order to sabotage production of a movie based on a comic book that's based on them (for which they're not getting paid). But it's really just an excuse to make references to movies Smith has made, movies that Smith's friends have made, or, on a couple of rare ocassions, movies that Smith simply likes. And I say references, because that's all he really does -- reference his past films. He doesn't joke about the films or do anything clever. He expects us to be thrilled by the mere mention of past projects. It's like he keeps winking and nudging us in the ribs as he plunges deeper and deeper into the center of his own personal galaxy.Simply being self-referential isn't interesting anymore. Been there, done that. Seeing Ben Affleck's character acknowledge the existence of an actor named Ben Affleck as he stares knowingly into the camera just isn't enough of a punchline.As the movie goes on, Smith continues to make increasingly obscure references to his own movies. These jokes may reward his large cult of fans, but those fans would probably be better rewarded if he gave them a decent film instead.There are some funny madcap bits as Jay and Bob traverse the nation, and Smith for once actually shows some visual flair, but it's usually not long until the next lame film reference. One of the few times he manages to do something clever with these allusions is when Affleck and Matt Damon pop-up in an funny riff on Good Will Hunting. But too often, Smith is merely reveling in the work of others without contributing anything worthy of his own. I'm sure it's always been Kevin Smith's dream to get in a light saber duel with Mark Hamill, but that does not mean anyone but Kevin Smith will be entertained by it. If someone ever gives me a budget to make a movie, I won't use it to subject other people to my own personal fantasies.When we're not being subjected to tepid film parodies, we have to listen to Jay's incessantly annoying catch phrases. As a film tandem, Jay and Silent Bob have never really worked, mainly because Bob is, well, silent. Smith actually does a lot with pantomime and facial expressions, but it's hard to contribute to the comedy when you can't say anything. There's also very little original about them. Cheech and Chong did the drug thing better, Beavis and Butthead did the dumb thing better, and Penn and Teller did the silent-partner thing better. Worse, they're just not likable. Jay isn't just a doofus -- he's a creep. Smith asks us to believe that a hottie like Shannon Elizabeth would fall for Jay because she can see that deep down, he's innocent and well-meaning. But Smith offers no evidence to support her contention.Much of Jay and Bob's banter, as it were, consists of fart jokes and gay jokes. When I heard that GLAAD was protesting the film, I figured they were overreacting. But, having seen the movie, I can see why they're upset. It's not that any of the gay jokes are particularly heinous, it's just the sheer quantity of gay jokes that's disturbing (count on one at least every five minutes).Aside from all the homophobia and self-glorification, Smith does contribute one original element to his Askewniverse in the form of Will Ferrell, who does his usual blithering idiot routine as a Federal Wildlife Marshall. Ferrell provides the same schtick you see every week on SNL, but the sad thing is, he's the funniest thing in the whole movie.I guess the joke is on me for bashing Jay and Bob in the past, then paying to see a movie about them. But maybe I'm just optimistic. I keep hoping Kevin Smith will fulfill his potential and make a great movie. This isn't it.

Humor is best achieved with simplicity few characters with a very clear plot.  Only a few of the characters should be a bit odd,not empty-headed potheads, but simply odd.

This movie isn't filled with the half-giggle thought provoking jokes that make more sense the more you think about them. Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back (JSBSB) is full of the kind of humor found in your last hustler magazine.Jay and Silent Bob are two friends whose life consists of hanging around outside a grocery story until they find out a comic book they've made is being turned into a movie. In hopes to stop the movie from being made (and stop the internet bad-mouthing), they head to Mirimax Studios. Hell, that's it. Characters are cardboard, sex is gratuitious, humor is toilet-level (how else do you explain George Carlin giving road head), plot is dumb. But then if that's the case, why is this movie so good? simple, it's because that's exactly what they were looking for! This movie is basically a collection of funny things happening all loosely tied together by Jay and Bob's plan to stop the movie from being made. And that's how this movie should be taken. Jay trying to give head to a nun, Affleck and Damon reliving a classic scene in Good Will Hunting, Jay recognizing Jason Biggs as the pie f***** guy in American pie, Chris Rock playing a variation his Nat X SNL role. Movie scene parodies from The Fugitive, Charlie's Angels, Scream, Star Wars. Some scenes are subtle, others smack you in the face, but they're all funny. Note Not having seen any of Kevin Smith's movies yet (Dogma, Chasing Amy, Mallrats, Clerks), I'm sure I missed some inside jokes, but I still found JSBSB incredibly funny. Eye watering funny (though not stomach-hurting funny). If you haven't seen those other movies, it really doesn't matter much -- watch this movie anyway.Bottom Line don't watch this as a movie, but a collection of hilarious scenes. May need multiple viewings since there were so many funny scenes, I've already forgotten most of them. 8/10.

Many things would have been funnier if the humor was made a little more subtle. For example, at one point Jay and S.B. ask something along the lines of Who would waste their money on seeing a movie about us?. This would be funny, but they then look directly at the camera, obviously looking at the audience. However, this is only stupid and could have been edited out to make the joke better.

Let me start by saying that this was my most highly anticipated movie of the summer.  I love all of Kevin Smith's previous movies (even Mallrats) and couldn't wait to see what he would do for the finale of the View Askewniverse.  There is a thin line between funny and completely distasteful, and Kevin Smih finally crossed it with this movie.The thing is, Jay and Silent Bob are characters who are good in small doses.  Their supporting roles in Smith's previous films kept them fresh and funny.  Unfortunately, two hours of Jay's mouth running is a little too much to handle.  Thought maybe these characters might be a little deeper than was let on in previous movies?  Nope, not a chance.  The entire movie talks about having sex, farting, doing drugs, etc.  Literally every other sentence contains some kind of expletive.  I should be used to it--after all, all of Smith's movies are like that, but in the past it's been done well.  It felt natural.  Here, it feels forced and becomes completely annoying, and it saddens me to see Smith joining the likes of the Wayons brothers with his writing skills and search for humor.    What's been so good about Smith's other movies is his amazing, quick, bantering dialogue.  You see very little of that in this movie.  After all, Jay is the one talking most of the time and he's not the sharpest knife in the drawer.  We rely on slapstick humor, and d*** and fart jokes.  THere are a few scenes that I found extremely funny, but in the end I was disappointed with this one.  It could have been awesome.  It's not.

What did make the movie, I felt was Silent Bob (Kevin Smith).  While Jay could get annoying with all his talking and toilet humor, this was the first movie of Kevin's where Silent Bob actually had more of a role, and it really seemed to work.  Still, I am glad that this is the end of the road for the Jersey movies by hi as I am not sure if I could find Jay much more funny after this.  So, if you have been at least a casual fan of Kevin Smith, go and see the movie.  If you are the type that gets offended very easily, it may be best to stay away.

Whaddya expect?","Date":"31 August 2001","Score":"","Genre":"Comedy","Review":"  I am amazed at how far Kevin Smith has come since he shocked the industry with Clerks.  That was a film made on a shoestring budget, filmed in black and white with what can only be surmised as Smith's friends in the lead parts.  Smith went onto make a 5 million dollar film with Mallrats and then made probably his best film with Chasing Amy.  Next came Dogma, where it seems Smith made many friends and they all seemed to show up in J&SBSB.  Along the way, Smith executive produced Good Will Hunting and must have gotten to know the Miramax boys quite well because many of the principal players appear in this film as well.  This is a film that is a feast for the eyes and if nothing else, it will keep you entertained just by counting the amount of Hollywood starlets that make cameos only to poke fun at themselves.  Some of the best ones are Matt Damon, Ben Affleck, Gus Van Sant, Wes Craven, Jason Biggs and James Van Der Beek.  Giving away what their cameos are all about would illicit a spoiler warning and it would also take away from some of the fun of the film.  So I will refrain and just say that even if you have never seen a Smith film before, this one will make you laugh.The film begins back in New Jersey at the Quick Stop convenience store where Dante and Randall are still working their jobs which they hate.  And even though it is seven or eight years after Clerks, it is somehow believable that these two miscreants would still be working here.  They are the kind of people that are quite knowledgable yet lack the drive or the ambition to really succeed at anything in life.  Everything is still the same inside the store as well.  The one shutter is still closed, the same sign is hanging from the cash register and Jay and Silent Bob are dealing weed outside the store.  Dante and Randall still look relatively the same as well.  But one thing has changed and that is Dante's finally become tired the two idiots standing outside his store.  He slaps a restraining order on the laconic Bob and the scurrilous Jay.  They flee and seek out other characters from other movies that they were in and one thing leads to another and they are off on a road trip to Hollywood to stop a film that is being made about them.Though it pains me to do so, I have to say that the first hour of this film was lacking in some areas.  It had some very funny bits but it also fell short in some areas.  That is all I'm going to say about that because once our two idiots/heroes get to Hollywood, the hilarity never stops.  Smith has convinced some of his cronies to appear as themselves and poke fun at themselves and this turns into some of the funniest bits I have seen in any Smith film.  I can truly say that if you are a Kevin Smith fan then you are going to love the final half hour of this film, and as I stated earlier, even if you are not much of a fan, there is still enough in here to make you chuckle.  There are those of you out there that will look at Smith innuendo as being perfunctory and see his shelf life as being ephemeral, and I'll tell you straight up that this film is not for you.  But I would in turn accuse you of being myopic and tell you that there is much more to this film than just fart and puke jokes.  Kevin Smith is one of the best writers working today and he is insightful and pensive in more scenes than it appears.  Jay and Silent Bob is a great way to end the series as it sums up everything that we may or may not have wanted to know from the other four films.I guess a good way to sum this up is just by saying that if you are one of the cult followers of everything that is Kevin Smith, then this is a perfect film for you you.  If however you think Smith is a sanctimonious, dogmatic blip on the map, then stay away.  I happen to think he is anything but prosaic and this is one film that will at least keep you smiling as you leave the theater.  After all ( small spoiler alert ahead) when Gus Van Sant is too busy counting his money to yell ACTION and Ben Affleck looks strung out from too many nights of boozing and whoring, that is funny.8 out of 10-- If you want my opinion on how this ranks with his other Jersey films, it would be Clerks, Chasing Amy, Dogma, Jay and Silent Strike Back and then Mallrats.  Still, it worth an eight, only because three of the four films rank at a 9 or better.

In this movie, however, there were, maybe two, of those scenes.  I know that it's tough to have dialog at all with Jay and Silent Bob as lead characters, but I wish they could get some in anyways.Fans of previous viewaskew films will enjoy this as a farewell to Jay and Silent Bob.

The gags--both visual and auditory--come fast and furious, and beg for repeat viewings. Even I, as a fan who has actually seen the other chapters of the VA saga (CLERKS, MALLRATS, CHASING AMY and DOGMA), could not catch every in-joke, role-reprisal and cameo in the first viewing. (I didn't even catch that the blonde in the jeep that drops Jay & Bob in Hollywood was---well, YOU read the credits next time you watch.)The story, like the previous movies, flows continuously and relatively smoothly. Smith proves he knows what it takes to make a movie that people will want to watch, and watch, and watch again. Not just for the connections to the rest of the Askewniverse, but also the great topical referencesto and commentary on STAR WARS, PLANET OF THE APES, GOOD WILL HUNTING, law enforcement, animal rights, and Hollywood in general.For those of you who have not seen this movie yet--WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU WAITING FOR? You don't have to have seen ANY of the other Smith films to enjoy JSBSB. Newcomers and Smith fans alike will enjoy the antics of Jay & Bob's cross-country quest to sabotage the BLUNTMAN & CHRONIC movie. I know I did. In fact, seeing this movie made me go and re-watch all four of the film's predecessors with a new appreciation.SNOOTCH TO THE MOTHER----ING NOOTCH!

Not only was this movie the funniest of all 5 of Smith's films, it was one of the funniest I have seen in a very long time.  I'll be the first one to admit that (especially compared to its predecessors) the plot and main storyline are pretty thin, but it doesn't take long to realize that that is kinda the point.  Its pretty obvious that after the first 4 films in the trilogy, Smith finally had the freedom to do whatever he wanted when making this movie, and takes full advantage of it.  Jason Mewes is at his best as the in your face Jay and his comments are made that much funnier when you are looking at Silent Bob's facial expressions & body language whenever Jay goes on one of his rants.  I was a bit disappointed that Dante & Randall had such small parts, but at the same time, I can't imagine this movie being any funnier.  And any movie with even a brief appearance by George Carlin is worth watching.  George is the king of comedy, and his short part is one of the most hilarious parts of this movie.

It was armed to the teeth with comedy from start to finish. Furthermore, non-drug users (like myself) can still get the full punch of the comedy in this film.(MINOR SPOILER ALERT)Jay and Silent Bob go on a noble quest to stop a movie being made based on their comic book alter-egos, because everyone on the internet are trashing them left and right.  That's the long and the short of the of the plot. The rest is filled up by the antics of Bluntman and Chronic and the colorful mess of character that they encounter.In addition to the returning favorites from the universe of the Jersey trilogy mythos (Dante ,Randel ,Holden etc) the story is stocked with new additions to add to the motley crew.  True that some of the jokes and inside refferences don't sell if you haven't seen Clerk ,Mallrats ,Chasing Amy or Dogma the average movie watcher can still find the movie funny as Hell. There's even a parody to Raiders of the Lost Ark that I don't think too many fans well notice.This film does have crude humor, which is consistant to a tipical Jay and Silent Bob event, but the crudeness is tame by todays standards as opposed to a film like American Pie or There's Something About Mary.  No one who plans to see this film should be harping about it's blue humor.No film is perfect, one of the problems with this film is the character that Chris Rock played.  He's character was more annoying then funny.  Even Jar Jar Binks pails by comparison.Other then ,that this movie ROCKS!  The paradies are awesome, the cameos are great and there's a psuedo-sequel that is so good, I couldn't even think to spill the beans.The rather unique and modern love story between Jay and Justice was also a big plus with this movie.I'm sure that Kevin Smith fans and new fans will love this ray of light in this lack-luster summer season.

He knows who is audience is; he knows how to write dialogue; and he's a wonderful director, as well as promoter.  Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back is no exception from his tradition of Mallrats, Clerks, Dogma, and Chasing Amy.The whole idea of a movie being connected with four other movies, all with very different plotlines, is rather outlandish -- but Smith conquers the challenge with no problem.  If you haven't seen those four, it's best to see them before you see the new movie.  If you're a fan of d*ck and fart jokes, it will still make you laugh till you cry; however, seeing those four prior to this one, the movie will make tons more sense (plus, you'll even catch some great one-liners that are in reference to the previous flicks).I won't lie and tell you that this movie is for everyone, but if you are a fan of Kevin Smith movies, like a lot of crude humor, you don't take life too seriously, or you just want to laugh at a couple of guys making the world seem like such a simple place, then JSBSB is for you!!

If you haven't seen at least one of the following Clerks, Mallrats, Chasing Amy, or Dogma - you will probably think this movie to be pointless.  Kevin Smith claims that this is the last time you will see Jay and Silent Bob together.  Due to this fact Smith has revisited each of his movies, taking the characters and locations (including all of his t.v. and movie heroes) and throwing them all into the mix, creating the motherload which is Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back.I've heard people complaining about the language and sex jokes, but these are the people who are not familiar with Smith's world.  Basically he doesn't discriminate, he insults everyone!  Do yourself a favor - go and rent Clerks and Mallrats at the very least before seeing this movie.  These two movies will introduce you to the wacky mind of Kevin Smith.  Jay and Silent Bob is funny from the start and is one of the few where you will actually sit through all of the credits.

Even `Mallrats' isn't as bad as you've heard, and is still a heck of a lot better than 85% of subversive comedies out there. But `Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back' is far from Kevin Smith's finest hour.If you don't know what I'm talking about in regards to any of these films, you might want to head to the video shop, or give `Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back' a miss. This is Smith's personal valentine to himself - it's an audacious director who films his own loving retrospective only ten years into his career. Numerous characters from his previous movies reappear, and you'd have to be pretty well acquainted with his output to catch all the self-referential jokes. It's a film that assumes you're in the club - to the point of characters looking out into the audience to see if you got the joke. If you're not in the club, you're going to be wondering what the hell's going on, unlike such films as `Waynes World', which do not require foreknowledge of the characters to be enjoyable. That's pretty alienating. In fact, Smith demonstrates exactly the `we're in the club' hauteur that he professes to be attacking.The conflict at the centre of the movie - Jay and Silent Bob want to get back at all the dopey teenage netheads who have dissed them on internet discussion groups - does actually have an element of truth to it. In his previous movies, Jay and his rotund pal (played by Smith himself) were comic relief, and their schtick is too thin as main characters. There are some funny pop culture refernces, but in the end you'll feel as if you've been at Kevin Smith's house with his video collection, and he's been saying `Wait - guys - watch this bit. Oh, this bit was SOOO funny. C'mon! Hahaha!'. This should have been a 15 minute download from his website, not something you pay good money to see in a cinema.

All right - full confession here - I still do.  There's something fascinating about a person that communicates with profanity, especially when it seems to take on a certain hypnotic rhythm of its own.  The success of 'Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back' is mostly due to the performance of Jason Mewes as Jay, who throws bad words around like confetti while giving the impression that he doesn't really know what they mean.  Sound familiar?  It's like you're thrown back to those grade school days when the class clown would toss out the f-word and then roll on the ground in devastated laughter.Kevin Smith is a very smart guy, but he has a weakness for the crude stuff, and God bless him.  There are dick jokes and fart jokes and gay jokes and sexist jokes and all those other kinds of jokes that you never hear on 'Frasier'.  Humor is humor, whether it's sophisticated or low-brow, but you know the low-brow material is what gets those belly-laughs.The cleanest jokes are the ones making fun of Hollywood and its relentless self-obsession.  Matt Damon and Ben Affleck ragging on each others' career choices, for example.  The only place the movie steps wrong is with the character Chris Rock plays, a virulent white-hating movie director.  Chris, buddy, you've done this.  We get it.  White people are bad.  Move on.It helps to be a Kevin Smith fan, because there are tons of in-jokes about previous Smith movies, but it's not necessary.  Being an internet hound will help, though.

After that, Jay and Silent Bob Strike was a downward spiral of unoriginality. Everything was ripped of in this move from Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon to The Fugitive to Charlie's Angels. It looked like Smith had lost every ounce of creativity in his mind and just decided to jump on the movie bandwagon and affiliate every popular movie into this one. And what's with all the celebrity cameos. I can understand having Matt Damon and Ben Affleck because they have been associated with most of Smith's movies. But why the hell is Smith trying to appeal to college generation so much? He grabbed nearly half the cast of American Pie and threw them into some of the most ridiculous meaningless characters he has ever had. Seann William Scott, actually pretty talented at playing a dumbass in every movie, played a character that did not have to be in the movie at all. Shannon Elizabeth played a nice girl in this film. And my question is how many nice girls do you know that look like Shannon Elizabeth? Jason Biggs, who with the exception of the American Pie's has done some of the worst films ever created, was another useless character just thrown in there to try and make sure guys and girls ages 16-25 would see this movie. Smith might as well have gotten Freddie Prinze, Jr. to fill out this awful mid 20's cast. One thing about this movie that could have been good but was ruined was how Smith would poke fun at other actors involved and even his own other movies. It was funny the first time they said something about it. But by the end when Joey Lauren Adams popped up and poked fun at Smith's movie Chasing Amy, which she starred in, it was way overused. The creativity that Smith showed in Clerks and Dogma is beyond compare. The dialogue, although long, was all very meaningful and used quite well in his other films. But what happened to that creativity? The best he could come up with for his last movie was beating up little kids for writing bad stuff on the Internet?All of the characters Smith had in Jay and Silent Bob strike back were put there not because he wanted them there. They were brought into this movie to try and get every possible person at this movie. Wil Ferrell, once again, played an awful movie character but people will come see the movie if they are a fan of his and/or SNL. There had to be someone to appeal to the African American audience. So smith brings in the very talented Chris Rock to play an anti-white person director who has been oppressed by just about everyone. And that character was funny the first couple hundred times we saw one like it. But it's unoriginal and annoying now. Smith also had to make sure males would like the movie. So he brings in 4 beautiful women headed by Elizabeth and Ali Larter from Varsity Blues. He then put them in the tightest possible clothing they could wear. And finally, he made them into dumb bimbo's. Something most guys would want to see. He throws talented actors in so they're fans will come and see a movie with them but turns them into shit characters. George Carlin plays a dick sucking hitchhiker. Carrie Fisher an extremely naive nun. It's just stupid. And it's sad. It's unfortunate that after this movie, no one will even want to see Jay or Silent Bob in another movie. They are two of the greatest characters created, and they went out badly. Smith even managed to rip off Scooby Doo and still couldn't make it good. All of Smith's loyal fans will see this movie. All the true one's will feel betrayed by his last installment. It was a total Hollywodized movie. And as most of us know, those ones always suck.

As in, you'll feel like you lost several IQ points after only a few minutes watching the movie.  That said, it's also funny, laugh-out-loud hysterically funny, destined to be to 2001 what SOUTH PARKBIGGER, LONGER, AND UNCUT was to 1999--the film of choice if you like your comedies on the raw side with absolutely nothing held sacred.First, let's get the disclaimers out of the way  This movie is NOT for kids.  AT ALL.  I did not think it was possible for a film to push the envelope of the R rating further than SPBLU, but this movie does it. How bad is it?  I found myself wondering, around the time Silent Bob had to put a cup over a strategic spot on Jay's pants, how much Smith must have had to cut to get the R because I couldn't believe so many obviously adult-only moments got past the ratings board.Also, if you're easily offended by (1) gay bashing, (2) d*ck and f*rt jokes (that's duck and fort, for those of you playing along at home), (3) overt sexual references, and/or (4) more variations of the F bomb than you can possibly imagine, stay away.  This movie contains all of the above, in so many permutations that after you're through being shocked, you might actually be intrigued by how in the world Smith came up with all of them.Finally, if you've not seen at least one Kevin Smith movie, you either need to rent one or find someone to fill you in on the characters in the View Askewniverse.  You'll enjoy this movie a whole lot more if you do.  My husband is a big Kevin Smith fan and has seen every one of his movies, so I went in with the equivalent of an encyclopedia for when I didn't quite get a reference or two.  If you've seen Smith's movies and hated them (especially if you hated Jay and Silent Bob), you will NOT like this movie AT ALL and should probably go see RUSH HOUR 2 instead.So, after everyone gets warned away by the disclaimers, who's left?  People who love Smith's movies.  Or people who have liked at least one of Smith's films and thought the characters of Jay and Silent Bob were at least entertaining (I fall into the latter category).  This movie, as one could guess from the title, centers around stoners/slackers par excellence Jay and Silent Bob and follows their efforts to strike back at the people bashing them (or rather, their comic book equivalents, Bluntman and Chronic, from CHASING AMY) on the internet by stopping production on the movie based on the comic book stolen from their lives.  Really, though, the plot is just an excuse for Smith to string a whole batch of non-sequitor sketches together, some of which work (the van of teenagers that picks them up hitchhiking is a scream) and some of which don't (Chris Rock's militant film director, a rip on Spike Lee, which should be funny but just comes off as hateful instead). The film is one gigantic in-joke--which is why it helps to have seen at least one Smith film previously--in which many of Smith's characters from previous films appear (including CLERKS' Dante and Randall, MALLRATS' Brody, CHASING AMY's Holden and Banky, all played by the same actors who played them in the films) as well as actors he's either cast in his films (Matt Damon, George Carlin, and the aforementioned Chris Rock are among the more easily spotted) or always wanted to cast in his films (Mark Hamill being the most notable of the latter).  And then there are the people who Smith cast just for the heck of it--AMERICAN PIE's Jason Biggs and DAWSON'S CREEK's James Van Der Beek, the two actors playing Bluntman and Chronic; Smith's wife Jennifer Schwalbach and daughter Harley Quinn Smith; directors Gus Van Zant and Wes Craven; 80's funk band The Time; E! news anchor Steve Kmetko and Comedy Central's Jon Stewart.  And, like most Smith films, it's peppered with pop culture touchstones; count all the way-cool references and win a case of Rice A Roni.  But against all odds, it works.  It's funny.  It's puerile, it's juvenile, it's obscene, it's guaranteed to be offensive to SOMEBODY, but it's FUNNY.  Stick around for the closing credits to be really amused by the right-on-target rap satire from Afroman, Because I Got High. Smith even puts credit cookies in for those hardcore fans watching the smallest details (including an exhortation to shop at Jay And Silent Bob's Secret Stash comic shop in Red Bank, NJ).Bottom line  Funny if you're a Smith/J&SB fan.

This is supposedly the last big screen adventure of Jay and Silent Bob, played by Jason Mewes and Kevin Smith, and he pulls out an almost non-stop laugh out loud comedy.The movie follows the two as they find out Bluntman and Chronic, comic book superheroes based on them, are about to be turned into a big budget movie by Miramax.  At first, they want to track down the creators to get their movie check, but soon learn that on the Internet many people are anonymously trashing them. This soon sets them upon a road trip to stop the movie from being made.This movie brings back many of the characters from Smith's other films (Clerks, Mallrats, Chasing Amy and Dogma), and will be enjoyed more by fans of them.  It is littered with inside jokes about these movies. Though you don't have to be a View Askew, Smith's production company, fan to enjoy it.The film is also filled with some very funny cameos, George Carlin and Chris Rock to name just a couple.  There are many more, but I only referred to the actors advertised, so not to ruin any moments.Mewes brings out his best performance as Jay in this movie.  Smith makes up for the lack of lines with his hilarious reaction shots; Rock has called him the `white Buckwheat.'  One of his funniest moments though is when he mimics John Belushi from Animal House trying to `stealthily' sneak across the campus courtyard.I was also really surprised by Shannon Elizabeth's performance.  Smith has brought out her best acting I have seen her do.The movie does have a few story discrepancies; some of the past films are referred to as `movies' while others aren't. But who cares this wasn't intended to be an intelligent comedy, no this was meant to be a take no prisoners slapstick comedy, laced with dick, fart and dope jokes.All in all, if you are in the mood for an evening of laughter, go and see Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back. 9 out of 10- HeathSp.s.   After the movie ends, sit back listen to Afroman's `Because I Got High,' read the credits and watch for one last cameo.

Kevin Smith needed closure to his fictional characters of Jay and his alter ego Silent Bob.  Like two lifelong friends finally graduating from high (and I do mean HIGH) school, even buddies need to go their separate ways.  This movie was, in a way, their graduation.  No more joint smoking outside of Quik Stop.  No more feuding with Randall from RST Video. No more diatribes about chicks that they aren't getting laid with.  In short, no more of their clever yet tired humor.  It was really funny in 'Clerks', pretty good in 'Mallrats', really intelligent in 'Chasing Amy'(a shock), and really mainstream in 'Dogma'.  Smith's newest installment 'Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back' simply REEKS of being a movie where the main characters simply wear out their welcome. These guys are just not funny anymore.  Just how many times can I hear Jay say the word F*ck and find it amusing? How many times can Silent Bob give his 'amusing' facial expressions to convey a point?  Now don't get me wrong, I'm not some prude who has grown to love AOR radio or Gordon Lightfoot songs.  It's just that Smith's movies have taken an intellectual dive since the release of 'Amy'.  I thought that the natural progression of a director was to churn out movies that better their previous works (see Tarantino and Coppola, for example).  In this one, Smith seems to pull out all the stops to go for the cheap laugh, especially with all the aforementioned cameos and pop-culture references.  Was I the only one who caught the reference to 'Land of The Lost' with the character name of Marshall Willenholly? I did laugh at this movie when I saw it, if only because I was viewing it knowing that it was a pure self-indulgent movie and Smith's his last attempt at throwing the characters of Jay and Silent Bob at us.  I hope Jason Mewes finds work elsewhere, because he is actually a pretty good actor (gasp!) who can make you laugh.  Kevin Smith will undoubtedly show up in a movie in the next year or two because he has presence and can be funny (plus he now has numerous Hollywood connections...)  But J&SBSB simply seemed to me like a mainstream attempt at cashing in for one last time on two guys who seemed to have reached their peak 4 years ago with 'Chasing Amy'.  If the world mourns the loss of these two characters, it's a shame.  I will be looking forward to Smith's next movie that features an INTELLIGENT plot and dialogue.  It was time to put these two guys to bed (not together...)  I hope that Smith will see his Jersey Trilogy (actually a 5 movie set) as a stepping stone to bigger and brighter things.  Until then, Kevin, I will look back at the movies that you have brought us and laugh...knowing that your best work is yet to come.

Why would they do such a thing?  To save their reputation from militant, foul-mouthed Hollywood movie haters on internet messageboards around the world...and to collect their much-deserved royalty money.

I can get behind a movie with Smith and Mewes as the stars (Wind 'em up and watch 'em go). It's that the entire middle of the movie is taken up by a malignant subplot involving Shannon Elizabeth and an Orangutan.

Although I was slightly concerned from the trailers, I still had high expectations of the movie.  I knew that it would be a lot different, but I'm glad to say that, it certainly did not disappoint.  The plot (I'm sure everyone has an idea by now) concerns our worthless heros getting word that there's being a movie made about them without their consent.  So what do they do? Well, in order to stop internet geeks (like myself) from trashing them online, they set out to throw a monkey wrench into the whole production.  What ensues is a the funniest road trip since Smokey and the Bandit.  We even get the smokey equivelent in one Will Farrell as a forest ranger guy who's hot on their trail.  I really can't give too much away here but I will say that literally EVERYBODY and their brother makes a cameo in this.  These aren't just cookie-cutter cameos either.  Every single one is used perfectly and they're all memorable.  Mark Hamill is quite hilarious as the comic book version of the role he is so well known for.  My personal favorite was Chris Rock (who I just couldn't get enough of) as the director.  Some more favs are Ben Affleck and Matt Damon as themselves and did I mention how good Will Farrel (I think I spelled that wrong) as the game warden/forest ranger/whatever. It's all tied together perfectly and Smith's favorite characters go out with a bang.  I'm almost saddened that this is supposedly their last movie, but if there had to be a last one,  I can't imagine it getting any better.Jay and Silent Bob Strikes Back runs at a lightning fast hour and a half. The movie lags nowhere and there is never a dull moment.  It's a good thing the rest of the theatre was laughing just as loud as I was because I might have gotten embarrassed.

They sold drugs in front of the liquor store in Clerks, They hung out at the mall in Mallrats, They were the basis of the Bluntman & Chronic comic book in Chasing Amy, and were modern day prophets in Dogma. (They even popped up for a few seconds in Armageddon and a couple independent films). Always minor characters in each of these films, this is the first film where it is ALL Jay & Silent Bob ALL the time.In this film, which is supposed to wrap up all the loose ends from the other films, Jay (played by Jason Mewes) & Silent Bob (played by the writer, director, etc...Kevin Smith) find out from their friend Brodie (from Mallrats) that the Bluntman & Chronic comic book (from Chasing Amy) which is based on their likenesses is being made into a movie and they aren't getting paid. When they track down Ben Affleck's character (from Chasing Amy) they learn about the internet and that people (who don't realize that the comic characters are based on J. & S.B.) are trashing them online. They decide to go to Hollywood to stop the movie from being made. Still with me? Well, try....Anyway, they meet up with 4 dangerously thin (seriously... one of the girls looks like you could use her to pick a lock) Anti-Charlie's Angels types who use Jay & Bob as patsies in a plot to steal diamonds. From there everything goes even more crazy.So there is a lot going on in this movie...the problem is that there is TOO much going on in this movie. Jokes are thrown away left and right. I think I think they could have taken the time to make 1 good joke per each 5 jokes the they just throw away. Plus there are 2 fart jokes that totally just turned me off to this movie.

I found maybe 2 short scenes really funny and the rest just fell flat.There are cameo appearances everywhere, but the only two that make you laugh are Will Ferrell (of Saturday Night Live) as a Federal Wildlife agent (who luckly got to improvise many of his scenes) and Chris Rock as an angry movie director (but even his character gets old fast). Other cameos include cast members of American Pie (warning sign right there), that blonde guy from Dawson's Creek, Morris Day & The Time, Matt Damon (as himself), Scooby Doo and the Mystery Machine (no joke), and tons of characters from Smith's other films. Too many ingredients can make a bad soup....and it did.What's sad is that this was a terrible way to end Smith's great New Jersey Chronicles.

This dialog is what made all of Smith's movies so funny, not raunchy swears.  Listen to the dialog thrown around by Jason Lee or Ben Affleck, or Dante or Randall, or even Matt Damon, and then listen to the dialog in this movie.  Notice the difference?  Unfortunately, with moving Jay and Silent Bob to the forefront, the dialog is limited to a guy who does nothing but swear and a guy who rarely ever speaks.  The dialog is simply lacking.

What's made Jay and Bob so funny in the past has been their interaction with the more serious characters of the movie (ie. the diner scene in 'Amy'). By making the supporting characters in JASBSB more silly and stupid than them eliminates any intelligence from the movie at all. The Wildlife Ranger, the Scooby Doo gang, the girl gang, the racist movie director ... all non-funny. Here's a hint. If you want to make a movie where swearing, d*ck jokes, and gay bashing, are the main focus of getting laughes, then direct the swearing, d*ck jokes, and gay bashing to the people that will be most offended by them, not to the people that are into it. For example the hitch-hiking scene with Carrie Fisher as a nun, works very well, because SHES A NUN, it wouldn't be funny if she was a whore. But what would have been even better, would be for her to be into it. That's pushing the envelope, that's being cutting edge. As far as the references to Smith's past movies. It's cute for the people that are familiar, but not funny to the people that are not (IE. the Buddy Christ statue on the dashboard of the nuns car).What I wanted was biting, squirming in my seat, brutal-humor and all I got was dumb-cops and monkeys.

Clerks and Mallrats are fun and funny movies that stick with you.  Strikes Back had all the makings for another classic but falls just short.  there were moments where i couldnt stop laughing and there were moments where i was just staring blank at the screen.  seems after the first 30 minutes the movie lost some steam but picked up again for the ending.  ill start with the good.  There were some damn funny one-liners in this movie.  What The F#*k Is The Internet?  still has me rolling, as does the small part when Will Ferrell attempts to jump over his car.  Jason Biggs is great and so is Mark Hammil.  problem is there are too many cameos that dont make the cut. George Carlin is the funniest man ever put on this earth, or any other planet, but that doesnt mean you get pure comedy.  his part may have looked funny on paper but failed to get one chuckle from the crowed.  Shannon Elizibeth may be Jay's dream but her nerdy ways envoked deep R.E.M. sleep for me.  the jewel hiest seemed forced and only worked to muddy up story, this movie didnt need a bigger plot.  trying to stop Bluntman and Chronic was enough, what came after that wasnt needed and is where i find fault with this movie.  while the other Askew flicks were direct and to the point, this one trailed off at times.  with that said, i did enjoy this, i look forward to seeing it again when blockbuster gets it.  im sure it will be enjoyed in my house for years to come, but too much buildup and just a tad disappointment makes me give this movie 6 stars out of 10.  could and should have been better.  but works because Jason Lea is too funny!

He created a movie with virtually no plot holding it together and, more importantly, made it work. Though heavy on offensive material, there is no doubting Smith's work as writer/director of Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back. Skit after skit is played out and held together loosely by Smith's staple pushers, loud mouth, trash-talking pothead Jay (Jason Mewes) and aptly named Silent Bob (Smith himself), and Wildlife Marshall Wilenholly (Saturday Night Live's Will Ferrell) who is chasing the duo for stealing a monkey (don't ask). While there are a few underlying stories to make the movie have some point, this movie is so heavily skit oriented that you'd think it was an episode of Mr. Show starring Bob and Dave only because they continue without so much as a break.Tackling serious subject matter in his last two films, Smith decided to try something lighter. Still heavy with his pop culture references, though, comes Smith with a great supporting cast and so many jabs at the film industry and the geeks on the internet that you can't help but love this movie... especially if you've watched and enjoyed Smith's previous films.Without a doubt (and without a plot), this was the funniest movie out so far this year and looks to stay that way.

With your pop culture saavy friends, this movie is an funny satire into current popular movies, actors, directors, music, and even the Napster controversey.

I was looking forward to seeing this, as I'm a huge fan of Kevin's films, but I was a little worried I was going to be disappointed. I love Jay and Silent Bob, but I wasn't exactly sure how they were going to carry the weight as the stars for two solid hours.I needn't have worried. This is, without a doubt, one of the funniest films I've seen in ages, and a fitting end to what is now a five-film trilogy. Of course, having the foresight that comes from repeated viewings of the other four films, while not required, is highly recommended. Smith's characters have had a way of cross-pollinating in his movies, and JSBSB is hardly the exception.To fill you in on what little plot you have to worry about Jay (Jason Mewes) and Silent Bob (Director Kevin Smith) discover that the rights to Bluntman and Chronic, a comic-book super-duo based on themselves, have been sold to Miramax and filming is underway on a feature movie. After learning that they were becoming the brunt of criticism on an Internet film site by arm-chair critics, they hitch-hike their way to Hollywood to stop the movie and save their reputations from ruin. On the way, they get picked up by a van of animal-rights activists who are en route to a animal-testing facility with plans to break in and rescue a lab monkey. Through a series of events (and I'm leaving tons out here specifically to avoid spoiling it for anyone), Jay and Bob become fugitives on the lam - and monkey-sitters - as they continue their westward journey to put a stop to the movie.Don't worry, it works.This film entertains on so many different levels. Of course, my favorite boneheads are at their profane best - but it's so much more than that. This film is savagely funny as it attacks Miramax (the distributor of three of Smith's films, who backed out on his fourth, Dogma, after protests from the Catholic community), Internet couch-potato critic wannabes, and the corporate film industry itself. It lampoons a good number of Hollywood films, often using the very actors (and directors!) from these films to achieve this. It pulls in plot threads and jokes from all of his other films (a good reason to watch the first four - if you haven't already - before seeing it). This film is scathing, but also self-deprecating. And it's undeniably obvious that everyone had a blast making this picture.Of course, it's foul and tasteless from start to finish. If you think you might be the least bit offended, trust me - you will be. There's something in this film to offend just about everyone. But if you have the intelligence and sense of humor to see it for what it is - and if you've enjoyed any Kevin Smith movie, you probably qualify - you'll have a blast, like I did.I laughed out loud - repeatedly - through this movie.I hate to see the New Jersey Trilogy draw to a close, but if it has to end, I doubt it could have ended on a more satisfying note than it did (for me, at least) with JSBSB.

Jason Lee (in two roles), Ben Affleck, Joey Lauren Adams, Renée Humphrey (*sigh* Trish the Dish!), Brian O'Halloran, and many others reprise their previous roles, while Shannen Doherty (Mallrats), Matt Damon (Chasing Amy, Dogma), Chris Rock (Dogma), and George Carlin (Dogma) return in new roles.Eliza Dushka and Ali Larter keep the hornballs enthused, while Shannon Elizabeth stands as a saving grace for bombshells everywhere by playing a caring, glasses-wearing teddy bear. Her relationship with Jay surprisingly enough makes J&SB a love story as well.Not only does the movie reuse old jokes that nod to previous films, such as the Dante working on his day off in `Clerks,' but it also acknowledges the audience three times, such as with Ben Affleck asking `who would pay to see a movie about Jay and Silent Bob,' then looking at the camera.Playing off TV shows and other summer movies (and ones from the recent past), J&SB pokes fun at Scream, The Matrix, Barney, The Fugitive, Dawson's Creek, American Pie (drawing heavily from that cast as well), Planet of the Apes, Good Will Hunting, and, as the title suggests, Stars Wars The Empire Strikes Back. Even Carrie Fisher and Mark Hamill appear. Hamill says that someone is going to sue George Lucas when Silent Bob uses the force (à la Mallrats) to retrieve a bong lightsabre. As with his roles as The Joker on Batman TAS, Hobgoblin from the Spider-Man cartoon, and The Trickster from The Flash television series, Hamill (who won't let James van der Beek upstage him) excellently portrays the Bluntman & Chronic villain known as the Cock-knocker.As for using Good Will Hunting, J&SB appear on the set of GWH2 Hunting Season, which takes quite a violent turn from the original's more intellectual tone (as the title suggests).All in all, the entire movie has been long in the planning. Smith fans may recall how Mallrats ended with J&SB walking away with an orang utan saying that it was another story. This movie IS that story. Because of these kinds of allusions to Smith's previous films, I suggest for anyone who has yet to see J&SB that they watch Good Will Hunting and the previous four View Askew films (Dogma, while hilarious, is not as pertinent, for it is only mentioned once by Matt Damon). And for those who have already seen J&SB, watch the other movies anyway &#150; it will make J&SB so much more understandable and thus funnier.PS &#150; Will Ferrell is his usual humorously annoying self.

Granted, I'd driven a hundred miles to see this movie.  Granted, I'd gotten six hours of sleep instead of seven. Granted, I was broke and needed entertainment.  But throughout all this, I decided I needed to enjoy this movie. I had to. As a recent fan of Kevin Smith's work, I couldn't help it.It hurt a little.  Not a lot, but a little.The first five minutes were rapidfire plot development.  So quick in fact, that I felt like I was watching a teaser.  By the time the movie was halfway over, I was still having doubts as to whether the actual movie itself had begun.  As usual, the characters were all incredibly well written. Smith's dialogue is excellent, and he plays Mewes like a musical instrument. (Insert the expected 'flute' joke here.) The various cameos ranging from Askewiverse classics to recent crowd favorites such as Jon Stewart and Wes Craven, however, made this movie come across almost too much like a fantasy home video for Smith.Pretty much the moment the monkey was introduced, I felt like it was too much.  Too many injokes, too much self-gratification in casting and plot. I almost felt like I was watching something too personal, like I was invading Smith's privacy.  Granted, for the price of admission, I was allowed this little spot of voyeurism.  But I had hoped for maybe a little less oral sex in my humor.  It was funny about four of the twenty or so times it was used to make a joke, the other times, it seemed to come across as expected, simply because that's how Jay's mouth works.I enjoyed this movie, but left feeling a bit left out.  I hope to see Jay and Silent Bob cameos in the future, but perhaps Kevin ought to try and thank Jason Mewes for his excellent work in five Askewiverse films by writing something in a totally non-Jay style for Mewes to do.  Give him something to show his stuff. "},{"Title":"Well It finally has come.","Date":"26 August 2001","Score":"","Genre":"Comedy","Review":"  The end of the Viewaskewniverse. I've seen all five movies now. This one in my opinion was uneven at parts. For example the Chaka Luther King stuff to me was not funny and Marshall Willenholly really wasn't that funny at the beginning either also the second half of the movie was pretty hit and miss for example the Miramax stuff was Gold but the clumsiness stuff and the Cat Fight at the end were not. I really enjoyed the beginning though and the cameos, especially Dante and Randall's. I knew everyone who was going to be in this movie but I had no idea about Judd Nelson since I heard he opted off the movie he obviously didn't and his scenes were kind of funny. Also Paul Dini is a Lot taller then I thought I have only seen him in pictures and interviews but he looked stocky in those. Overall it is definitely a must see for the fans and I will see it again but it's not the best of the bunch in my opinion because it has certain problems unlike Clerks and Amy which flow very well. This one is in tone the sequel to Mallrats and fans of that movie alone will enjoy this but this was definitely a treat for us fans it's just that it could've been trimmed a bit and where was Alyssa's other sister Heather? . I can't wait for the DVD though since I know it will be jammed packed with stuff the only problems I really had was that like I mentioned before it could've been edited a bit more. I did see a bit of change in Smith's direction though he has obviously matured over the years. I'm glad he is finally able to move on from these character and tackle new and challenging projects. I can't wait to see his next whatever it might be. "},{"Title":"Jay and Bob go out...","Date":"26 August 2001","Score":"","Genre":"Comedy","Review":"  Well..

Surely some hardcore statistician out there can let us know the top 5 F-movies of all time; JSBSB could be the new number one.To this viewer, it appears that Smith exercises his increasingly impressive movie making skills in what has almost become a trademark humble and self-deprecating manner, by filling the screen with absurdly moronic idiotically juvenile content.  In other words, Perfection for what appears to me as the film's desired outcome.  What I mean is, Smith's expertise in the art and science of making a movie reaches an all time high, while he makes fun of himself (almost as much as he makes fun of Affleck) with the absurdity of the images and dialog on the screen.  You mean there's a script for this?  Absutively Posilutely Hilarious.  The movie delivers everything Smith could have possibly promised, both to the studio and to the millions of loyal, if rather demented, Smithereens.  I hereby nominate Smithereens as the official name of Kevin Smith cultists everywhere; let's hear some Smithereens theme music in Return of Jay and Silent Bob. Moreover, anyone who can package and sell The Great White Buckwheat as a 21st century star of DVD and screen has definitely blown the naysayers and MoviePoopShooters (aka AintItCoolers) to Smithereens.That said, if you go off this film with the intent of some high-brow deconstruction, I can only say one thing Make sure you pay full ticket price to exercise your manifest literary rights, and F yous up yous stupid a$$es.

Oh my god, is the story ever dumb.  Read the plot summary from any review and ask yourself if it sounds dumb.  Does it sound dumb?  Oh, *it is*. It is dumb, it is trite, it is downright boring at times.But Kevin Smith did not make this film to prove to the film industry that he is a serious and reckonable screenwriter, director, and film maker (which he is).  True to advance billing, the script is overflowing at both ends with inside joke after after inside joke from the previous four films.  Some of them work very well and others are so contrived, you wish to have your ears lopped off (Banky Chocolate covered pretzel?... *groan*).  The ones that work, however, more than make up for the ones that do not.

The movie appealed to me in a way I did not expect it too, even coming off as sickly romantic at times, a la Buffalo 66 (but in a different way) or, more true to life Free Enterprise.

Jay and Bob does all that, as well as fill in the abhorrent dialogue with f&@!-f@^@!-FW*W*! every chance they get. It got to the point where I couldn't even follow where a scene was going because I was busy being hit with every obsenity ten times in the space of five seconds. Come on, people, that's not quality film. That's trash. OK? And I'm shocked George Carlin lent his face to this, and even more so Carrie Fisher and Mark Hamill. Others had cameos from previous Smith films, but I noticed the great Linda Fiorentino did not, no doubt wanting nothing to do with this filth.The film was filled annoyingly with pop culture references and oh, I get it, they're making fun of themselves jokes. COme on, this doesn't make me laugh. You gotta come up with something a little more inventive and witty to make me even remotely laugh. Shannon Elizabeth dancing crazy in glasses and falling down does not make me laugh, because I'm not five years old. Ok? But it appears that's the level of humor the cast and crew share who made this absolutely, simple awful film. You know what's even more sad?? There are hundreds, no, thousands of scripts locked in volts with some intelligence that will never see the light of celluloid. And something like this gets made and sells out seats everywhere. Sad.

People obviously keep demanding more of these characters and while they may be dear to his heart, and pocketbook, he probably wants to move on.  Of all the View Askew productions so far, this is by far the funniest.  The smart thing Kevin did though, was to shove so much of Jay and Bob down our throats in this latest installment, that you may never want to see them in anything else again.  I know I don't (Except for the animated movie).  There are almost as many cleche's and movie rip offs as there are utterances of the word F**k.  Some of the best are The Fugitive, Plannet of the Apes, and The Phantom Menace.  And speaking of Star Wars, look out for not only Mark Hammil, but Carrie Fisher.  Judd Nelson is unrecognizable.

He burst onto the indie film scene with the itsy-bitsy budgeted, big splash reaction anticlimax film Clerks. He went on to make a few more day in the life of your average-American- population-is-like-this- lackluster person films that, each involved strong oddly likable average characters doing oddly enjoyable average things. They are a collection of hip quazi-Seinfeldesque films geared towards the 18 to 25 year olds if you will. Smith had the comic book store society, lots-o-pot, alluring yet unobtainable chick babes, and these brilliantly profane verbal ballets by a particularly funny and perverse stoner-dude named Jay (Jason Mewes). Jay's a bellow the radar type who always manages to offend or spew words that continually back up the assumption of his general uselessness to society&#133;other than being a supplier of a well-needed bag of blunts (Maryjane-joints-doobies-dimebag) to the locals of course.With J&SBSB you get the feeling Smith sat at his desk, or commode, and thought I'm gonna make this final hurrah as out there as possible, throw in every gag I can think of, stay true to my pop culture references and cynicisms and get some big stars, whom I have incriminating pictures of, to rag on themselves, in the funniest ways imaginable...He's called in a troughful of these stars in delectable cameos. Including a few household names, like the mega-edible (in a toasted blueberry muffin with full fat butter dripping down the edges way), Ben Affleck and Ivy League looking cutey (aka Boston Choppers), Matt Damon, he's enlisted the actor forever linked to fornication with a pie, Jason Biggs, called on a big Blunt smit- Mr. Will Farrell - who shows up to steal scenes away from his fellow actors, and parlayed that just -has-to-glance-your -way-and-you-laugh chocolate delicacy Chris Rock. Smith's also brought back a bevy of characters his past audience will cheer for as they prance across the frames too like; charming Jason Lee and annoying voiced Joey Lauren Adams, and the original pot comic George Carlin in a brief but funny appearance.Story goes Hollywood is making a movie about Bluntman & Chronic, a comic book based on New Jerseyians Jay (Jason Mewes) and Silent Bob's (Kevin Smith) life as stoners turned action heroes. Jay and Silent Bob had no idea. Not to mention, what about a little dough to parade one's life? That's not what really upsets them though. They're all worked up into a revengeful tizzy because the Internet buzz that developed around the soon-to-be-made movie is all about what losers the real Jay and Silent Bob are. They're being called names, and that is just unacceptable dude! And as boys will be boys the answer is simple to Jay; they've got to stop the film from being made, that's the only way to end the gossip and save their sterling reputations. Simple enough...so the cashless, clueless palookas hit the road, off to California to battle the studio.Thumbing across the states, their road trip is the body of the film. Jay and Silent Bob encounter all sorts of wacky people, and some that border on hallucinogenic. They burn a few blunts with Scooby Doo and the gang. Meet up with a gang of gals ala an every guy's fantasy sequence who turn out to be less then what the boys had expected. This gets the boys involved with the law, a secret organization, and ads an Orangutan to their posse. Which sets the law on their trail, well, a dimwitted wildlife ranger (Will Farrell) a few plays on some famous films like the original Planet of the Apes, The Fugitive, Star Wars- including a bit part by Luke Skywalker himself, and bingo you've got the plot and about 5000 laughs a minute.Being versed in Smith's past works and in on the joke here, I say J&SBSB is a f*&^%in' hysterical flick! Smith's managed to spoof himself and Hollywood in so many ways, you may have to see it twice to truly enjoy and savor every oozing juvenile word. Sure, some people are going to be offended&#133;There's already hoopla boiling around the opening from GLAAD about the bombardment of gay jokes that run through out the film. Jay and Silent Bob, have always been an ambiguously gay duo no? And it is done in a what an idiot these guys are way. To me, Smith seems to be making fun of people that homophobic, and ignorant, more than glorifying them.Smith can handle the latest wave of large wave mayhem surfing, he's probably sitting back and drinking in that cool refreshing controversy tea his so famous for. Controversy you say? You may recall his last film noir Dogma the religious spoof received a verbal lashing from the Catholic Church folks. He was labeled a heathen working for Lucifer or some such nonsense. Did they see the movie was a thought that sprang into this God-fearing reviewer's mind instantly...Dogma wasn't that great and certainly wasn't going to start springing up cults of anti-Catholics across the continental divide. Though Smith will have to 'splain himself to the almighty later for the Alana Morrissey casting&#133;J&SBSB is not an academy award-winning venture; don't think Smith intended it to be. The film work looks like a high school student's dad gave him a movie making kit for graduation. But, it's still very funny. Yes, those familiar with Smith's prior works are the targeted audience and will laugh harder since he's made a celluloid stew of in-the-know references, certainly that was his intention.J&SBSB is juvenile, and be warned, often crude. It would be a big mistake to take your youngins'. And, I triple double warn you if you're a PBS subscribing suburbanite who's only joy in life is getting in the shortest teller line at your bank's branch or the New York Times Crossword puzzle gets you sexually stimulated- you should skip this.

It was really a great way to say goodbye to these characters that have been with us for going on eight years now.That's not to say that it would have been bad under other circumstances.

Glutted on a budget of ten million dollars and a thick rolodex of Hollywood friends, the movie adopts the uneven form of the Road Movie early on, and does its damndest to stuff as many pop culture references as it can (a large majority of which revolve around Smith's own pop culture creation, the `View Askewniverse') into its hundred minute running time.  This would be fine if the movie could somehow find a balance between a coherent narrative and the rapid-fire string of gags, but it never does, and the smirking inanity that Kevin Smith has always prided himself in finally begins to seem gratuitous.  As the titular duo, Jason Mewes and writer-director Smith's journey from Red Bank, New Jersey to Hollywood, California (on a mission to stop the production of a Miramax movie about characters that are based on their own pot-smoking existence) often seems like what it very well may be  the most irresponsible possible edit of itself.  Although it contains a bear's share of rewarding sequences for Smith's die-hard fan base, subplots and secondary characters are either given way too much screen time or not enough, with an almost tactical emphasis placed on what's most unimportant.  Many may be quick to forgive the basic fundamental mistakes Kevin Smith has made here in exchange for a few cheap laughs, but I believe that any movie that wastes the presence of both George Carlin *and* a reasonably well-trained orangutan is simply unforgivable.

Don't get me wrong - J&SBSB is an excellent movie, (Probably one of their best) but I don't feel that it was a good way to close out the series. This is the last movie View Askew is doing with Jay and Silent Bob.The thing about this movie is the fact that unless you've seen every other VA movie, you won't get any of the in-jokes, and there are a lot of in-jokes. For instance, there is one scene where Brodie asks Jay and Silent Bob if they'd like a chocolate covered pretzel. I was laughing my head off, realising the in-joke from Mallrats, but my friend (Who hadn't seen any previous VA flicks) didn't get the joke.Basically, if you haven't seen Clerks, Mallrats, Chasing Amy, or Dogma, then I reccomend you see the four of them before seeing J&SBSB, but make sure you see J&SBSB.Other than that, the movie is actually very well crafted. It never gets boring, has a laugh around every corner, and always keeps you in suspense for what's going to happen next. There is one thing missing from J&SBSB though, and that is the conversations. Nowhere in this movie will you find the insane debates about insane subjects we've seen in Clerks or Dogma. (Even Mallrats had one) I guess Kevin Smith left that out to help the movie flow better for Newbies, but I think it would have been better with something in there. (For instance, a discussion on idiocy with Brodie - that would've been fun)There are lots of funny cameos in the movie that you wouldn't expect. People like Carrie Fisher, George Carlin, Mark Hamill, James Van Der Beek, Jason Biggs, the list goes on. Some of them are quick so make sure you catch them all, and remember to stay after the credits for a 5 second shot of - well, you'll see.I reccomend this movie to VA Newbies, on the condition that you've seen at least one of the movies or have a friend with you. But for VA fans, that reccomendation becomes a full fledged scream. SEE THIS MOVIE!!! Kudos to Kevin Smith for pulling off such a great job, but next time he should work on including some more of the classic View Askew formula. After all, a bigger budget doesn't mean less work.

At worst, Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back is a cameo-intensive, self-indulgent film filled ENTIRELY of off-color sexual humor and inside jokes that tie in with Smith's other movies (including Good Will Hunting and Scream 3).  So which is it?  Well, it really depends on how big a fan of Smith you are.  Now, I've seen all the other films Smith has written/directed, and even regularly buy the excellent comics Smith writes.  I also own DVD editions of his previous films.  I think that makes me a pretty loyal fan.  This film really caters to people like me, who love Smith's work.  Unfortunately, that's pretty much all it does.  Without the constant cameos (and I do mean CONSTANT) and inside jokes the movie would be about 10 minutes long.  Imagine someone who has never seen another Smith movie trying to make sense of this film!   Even to me, a fan of everything Smith does, this movie grew tiresome. (Look, kids!  Mark Hamill.  Thanks.)  This movie was Smith's Phantom Menace, the film that only the most ultra-hardcore fan could possibly enjoy, and then only out of pure sense of loyalty.

They were trying to sabotage the movie because they were getting blasted online.

For those people that are still reading and wondering what I thought about the movie well it was fantastic! I really enjoyed it. I speculated as to wether a movie souly featuring a guy who never speaks and a guy who speaks way too much would work-those speculations were pleasingly shattered after about 5 minutes of film time. Smith fans go see this film. I have no doubt in my mind that you will all understand and fully appreciate what he tries to do with JASBSB. Casual and non-fans, this may or may not be your film, it depends on you. I guess that was Smith's intentions the whole time.

It's fantastic, his imagination really runs wild, and you're never left with a moment's piece from all the jokes. If the dialog isn't making you laugh, then something in the background is. You just want to see this movie again and again. Buy all day tickets and live in that room. Every scene that's ever made you want to be in the movie biz because it would be just so damn fun to do is in this movie. It's like stepping into Jay and Silent Bob's world. The turn out of people with cameo's just goes to show how popular Smith is to this industry. Bob and Jay's duel with Mark Hamill is a mixture of Star Wars with 60's Batman and gave me the burning desire to see Sam Raimi's Spider-Man or anything comic related on the planet. His love of these movies and comics just rubs right off on you and you walk out of the flick just wanting to grab your girl/guy/pal and watch 24 hours of View Askew movies with some other classics in-between.The very intro clued people into just how damn silly this movie will be. If you have any worries, they'll be put to rest within the very first few moments of the film. Jason Mewes never becomes tiring, and Kevin Smith's Silent Bob is one of the most underrated acts. Smith's facial expressions, hand movements and background movement do more than words ever could. Mewes's full personality shines, as we're given the full perspective of Jay's character. Every word he says is well crafted and is given with an Oscar winning performance. Smith light-heartedly makes fun of the film industry, the internet, comics and everything else while still being as sadistic about it as possible.Some downfalls 1) If anyone's read the comics, you'll notice that some scenes are taken right out of the books. They're all great ideas, but this is a shame for some because it's like watching something all over again. This is great for those of you haven't read the comic books, but is a drag for others. Unless of course you want nothing better than to see the comics in live action. 2) Casting Will Ferrell (Federal Wildlife Marshall Wilenholly) was a mistake. His style really clashes with Smith's and takes away from the movie. He breaks your concentration, and is the type of stupid silly that people who watch Smith flicks try to stray away from. 3) The parody of other movies reminded me so much of other REALLY bad movies that I found them almost out of taste. Smith pulls them off as best as they can ever been done, and are as funny as hell, but I still get Scary Movie flash backs just thinking about it. 4) Not enough of the oldies were in it. I was hoping for more from Dante and Randle especially. Since they got Smith where he is today, I wanted to see more screen time devoted to them. And I could always do with more Jason Lee.Those are all just knit-pickings, and I think J&SBSB is Smith's best effort to date. It's fast paced, never leaves you wishing a certain scene was over and done with, and allows you to laugh at the very things you love and walk away reminding you just what great flicks those were too. His direction has really grown, and the camera takes a much more active role in the film. Smith is the biggest movie fan to become director, and has some of the greatest senses of humor a human has to offer our race.

Most of Kevin Smith's previous films in the New Jersey Chronicles series have had some sort of message, be it about religion (Dogma), sexuality (Chasing Amy), or anything else. But Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back is just pure comedy. But it is great comedy. Definitely one of the funniest movies I have seen in a very long time. Any moral in the film would just take away from the laughs, so it's better off.I don't want to give too many of the jokes away, but take my word for it, the film is absolutely hilarious. I'm not generally a fan of gross out/sex comedies like this, but Kevin Smith does a such a great job of writing the jokes that J&SBSB is infinitely funnier than all of those other movies combined. There's tons of hilarious cameos in the movie. I swear, it'd be easier to list all of the people who AREN'T in the movie. Some of the highlights include a bit with Matt Damon and Ben Affleck playing themselves, a bit with Jason Biggs and James Van Der Beek playing themselves, and a bit with Mark Hamill (Luke Skywalker) spoofing Star Wars. Actually, the entire movie is like a highlight reel. Other movies would be lucky to have 1 or 2 jokes this good.A lot of the characters from the View Askew/New Jersey Chronicles family also make return appearances in Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back. Ben Affleck, in addition to playing himself, also reprises his role from Chasing Amy. Jason Lee reprises his roles from both Chasing Amy and Mallrats. There are numerous others as well. There are quite a few in-jokes that will be lost on people who haven't seen the other movies. But most of the jokes will be understood by anyone. I saw the movie with a friend who hadn't seem any of the previous ones, and he thought it was hilarious. The little in-jokes are like an added bonus in film that is, otherwise, still extremely funny.Of course, I can't talk about Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back without talking about Jay and Silent Bob (Jason Mewes and Kevin Smith). For the first time in the series, they have a movie all their own. And they carry it very well. Jason Mewes shows that he has come a long way as an actor, and is more than capable of carrying a film. And Kevin Smith as Silent Bob is the perfect companion (or should I say, hetero life mate) for the foul-mouthed, over-sexed Jay.While I'm talking about Kevin Smith, I should mention his directing. His writing skills have always been great, but some people have criticized his directing. I never thought he was a bad director, but he has definitely improved since Clerks, his first film. He's gone from being a pretty good director, to a very good one. It's uncommon to see direction this good in a slapstick comedy movie.On a slightly serious note, I want to briefly mention the GLAAD protests of this movie, saying it is overly homophobic. I'm gay, and I didn't find it at all offensive. I think they forget that Jay is, basically, a moron, so anything he says can't be taken seriously. Smith has said that he intended it as a satire, and I think he succeeds. There's actually a point in the film where a character is chastised for calling something gay. There's also a funny disclaimer about it in the credits.Actually, there's lots of funny stuff in the credits, including a cameo by Alanis Morissette at the very end, so stick around. Overall, there's really no way Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back could be any funnier. Congratulations to Kevin Smith for creating a movie that is extremely crude, but extremely funny.Rating 10/10 "}{"Title":"A treat for Kevin Smith fans","Date":"22 August 2001","Score":"","Genre":"Comedy","Review":"  Kevin Smith offers up a treat for his fans with this hysterical sendoff of his cast of players.  The film is a wonderfully self-indulgent adventure that makes no apologies for failing to explain its humor to the uninitiated. In short, this is the feature film that you would make for your buddies if you had the resources.  It is also hands-down the funniest picture of the year and the movie which introduces us to one of the sexist girl-gangs in Hollywood history Shannon Eliazbeth, Eliza Dushku, Ali Larter, and newcomer Jennifer Schwalbach-Smith.

He has made a film not just for himself as a filmmaker, but for the fans. This film is constantly reminding us of where he's been, and possibly where he's going. From the very opening, where we find the origins of Jay and Bob, to the final frame of the film, (SPOILER ALERT!) where God, herself (credited as That Woman) closes the book, literally, on the View Askewniverse... possibly forever. For fans of the Jersey films, this film will serve as a true testament of growth. From the 16mm, shot in black-and-white Clerks to the Super 35, color-saturated widescreen vista of J&SBSB, we see how far Kevin Smith has come as a writer and director. He may complain about his deficiency as a visual stylist (ref. the Dogma screenplay), but he does a terrific job with handling the many things this movie throws at you.Jason Mewes turns in a great performance as everyone's favorite foul-mouthed drug dealer. Several times, I caught myself being amazed at how far he, too, has come as an actor. And Kevin Smith's performance as Silent Bob really hearkens back to some of the great silent performers of the last century--Buster Keaton, Charlie Chaplin--his facial expressions and gestures are well worth the price of admission. And when Silent Bob speaks, the world not only listens, but laughs their collective asses off as well. And this marks the first (and perhaps the last) time we will hear an enraged Silent Bob. The cameos by the cast of thousands is also another great reason to see this movie. From the hilarious turn by Mark Hamill (trust me, you can't miss the cartoon-like HEY KIDS! IT'S MARK HAMILL!! (applause) supertitle), to the sublime George Carlin, you'll recognize many different actors from all walks of the entertainment world. Diedrich Bader is hilarious as the security guard who just LOVES to watch (seriously!), and Will Ferrell is extremely funny as Federal Wildlife Marshal Willenholly. On the whole, this is a great film for the fans of the series. If you're not a View Askew nerd, you'll still enjoy it, but miss out on most of the in-jokes. Oh, and yes... Mallrats closes with Jay and Silent Bob walking away with an orangutan named Suzanne. This is that whole other story that they were talking about!!

Those who are unfamiliar with Smith's past work as well as current movies may find themselves missing quite a few of the jokes. I hate reading long reviews, so I'll wrap it up now and elaborate some other time. All in all, J&SB SB is a great wrap up to Jay and Bob's adventures, as well as a nice jab at Hollywood- not so much cynical and unappreciative, but more of a good-natured teasing. It's sad to see them go, but I'll be happy to watch this Jay & Silent Bob movie over and over again when I'm missing their inane antics.

Unlike his earlier efforts, which dealt with such taboo topics as religion and sexual identity, Jay & Silent Bob Strike Back holds aloft no moral statutes.  At best the movie contains a kernel of a plot in the idea that everyone everywhere gets criticized by someone in one way or another, so you shouldn't let it bother you.  Not quite the religious ponderings of Dogma.  But that's not to say that Jay & Silent Bob doesn't deliver exactly what it intends to.  It's funny. Damned funny.  And if you've seen at least one or two of his other films, it's an even bigger treat.  By the way, if substance is lacking in this flick (although it doesn't really need any), style more than makes up for it.  Smith's visual direction has been maligned more than once for being flat, but J&SB comes through with some classy, Hollywood-style visual effects.  One that immediately comes to mind is the diamond heist scene where four female thieves traverse a ridiculously complex web of laser-beams in order to steal some jewels.  Expect tons of laughs and more curse-words, fart jokes and Jay-isms in this outing than all of  the Jersey films put together.  I recall Smith once mentioning in a commentary that he received harsh criticism for shooting Dogma in wide-screen because the film's content didn't warrant such a dramatic and expressive format.  I can't wait to hear what they think of this one.

The story goes that the duo, played by Jason Mewes and director Kevin Smith, has recently discovered that a movie is being made based on the comic book `Bluntman and Chronic,' which happens to be a fictional representation of their real life personas, a la Chasing Amy.  After discovering the Internet and reading bad comments about the movie's characters posted on a website, they go on a cross-country mission to stop its production to avoid further negative comments about their alter egos and, ultimately, themselves.However, the strength of the film lies not with the plot, but rather with the cameos, the rips of other better known movies, and the tie-ins from all four prior Askewniverse pictures.  When more than a handful of Hollywood stars get together to make a movie, the result is oftentimes regrettable. This is not the case with Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back, with appearances by everyone from current teen heartthrobs to screen legends.  Stars appearing in the film include James Van Der Beek, Carrie Fisher, Wes Craven, Alanis Morissette, Scooby Doo and the Gang, Jon Stewart, George Carlin, Gus Van Sant, Morris Day and the Time, and Shannen Doherty just to name a few.Apart from calling in favors from seemingly every actor, actress, and director in Hollywood, Kevin Smith does his best to pick at films that have marked the movie industry since the late 1970's.  Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back takes aim at both classics, such as Star Wars and E.T., and more recent movies, such as Charlie's Angels, Good Will Hunting, and Scream.  As not to forget his faithful Askewniverse fans, Smith does an excellent job tying in images, characters, places, and ideas from his first four films.While it isn't necessary to see Smith's other movies first to enjoy this one, some of the dialogue makes a lot more sense and many of the jokes are a lot funnier because they flow right from the other films, a skill that many of today's directors have trouble with when doing sequels.  Although Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back is littered with the types of foul language and crude sexual humor that has become common to movies such as American Pie and Scary Movie, Smith does not depend solely on these things as a source of entertainment for his audiences.  Smith's final Askewniverse film not only lives up to the standards set by its predecessors, but it also completes a series that will be admired and enjoyed for many years to come, without a feeling of loose ends still needing to be tied.

Not like a Jerry Zucker haha, but they actually make sense within the context of the story and the quips and jabs are part of the plot. The pacing reminds me of old Marx brothers movies. Well, that's the craft of the script. It's a relatively simple plot but the execution is pretty flawless with a healthy dose of genitalia, gay, and sex jokes.Both Jay (Jason Mewes) and Bob (Kevin Smith) play off each other and everyone else well enough to keep the movement going. Like Bond or Superman (or any other franchise), after four films playing the same character, you pretty much know how to do it and what works for a character (unless you're George Lucas). There are plenty of cameos, which I think says something about the way Kevin Smith works and how others respect him.An interesting bit is how big this movie is (or seems with a $15M budget). Complete with digital effects (bullets like in Saving Private Ryan, Charlie's Angels and animals) and explosions and eye-candy, it has the best look of any View Askew film, even lighting! But they also just help serve the story and frolick. From a technical side, it's sort of View Askew grows up. Lots more production value, stunts, visuals, even a decent score from Powerpuffs and Clerks the Animated Series composer James Venable.In the words of Chaka, this movie makes House Party seem like House Party 2. It is a party. A party for fans of Clerks, Chasing Amy, Dogma, and even Mallrats. With one good laugh, seeing old friends, one good time after another, and tons of references for film lovers abound. And even the most precious moment the origin of Jay and Silent Bob, in case you ever wondered.It should be noted that in some ways, Kevin Smith is very much a Shakespeare of the stoner gen. Within tawdry jokes and adult gags that appeal to the basest viewer, there often is an intelligent, poignant message. In Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back, the message is clear Kevin Smith loves his fans and this movie is his gift to them.  It is a unique ability to create characters that others consider friends. Smith knows this, appreciates and rewards.

Well, I left the theater a bit let down at what I had seen. While the first third of the movie is hysterical, the rest of the movie gets real hit or miss as it goes along. It's almost like writer/director Kevin Smith spent a great deal of time working out the first third or so of the movie, and then started filming without knowing what he was going to do next.But, the one thing that carries this movie are the terrific performances by Jason Mewes (a.k.a Jay) and Kevin Smith (a.k.a. Silent Bob). These guys are just so clue-less and total losers, but you just can't help but like 'em. Whenever they are on screen the movie is great (with the exception of a couple of small scenes) but around the midway mark the focus starts focusing on a bunch of jewel theives and a forced romantic subplot starts getting in the way. The movie does manage to end with a bang, but I just couldn't help but feel a bit disappointed with the results.Another mention should be that Chris Rock proves once again that he is easily one of the most annoying, talentless and unfunny actors working today.....yet he still keeps getting tons of work. I noticed that not one person in the audience laughing at his pointless tirade.But for the most part the movie is for the most part a love letter from Kevin Smith to fans of his other films (specifically Clerks, Chasing Amy and Mallrates) and any movie that has the unbelievably hot Eliza Dushku in panties and a bra (and a leather body suit with ample cleavage!) is all-right in my book.Good but could have been much better.Rating7.0      "},{"Title":"A-875-b6","Date":"20 August 2001","Score":"","Genre":"Comedy","Review":"  It is not without serious consideration that I sit down and write a review of Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back. I stall, just because of the fact that I don't want to be part of his lame joke. You see, in the latest Kevin Smith fiasco he tries to make us (his audience) feel ashamed for not liking his films or his style of filmmaking.  So since I don't want to be one of the people Jay and Silent Bob beat up at the end of the movie, I won't review it, I'll simply give him some advise. Who am I to give advice? Well, I am a fan. And I have been very pleased with his earlier films but lately he just seems distracted and un-focused. He has lost his touch. He had, and still has from time to time, a talent for telling stories about the mundane things in life, Clerks and even Mallrats (which he hates so much for making) completely take place in everyday events. He makes it interesting. And that's a gift, but is a gift he seems to be neglecting. The past two films Jay and Bob and Dogma have been driven by a plot that is so ridiculous that they seem to be written by another man. So my first advice is stick to the mundane, you make it great.Secondly, Stop using Ben Affleck in your movies the man sucks! There's a particular painful scene in Jay and Bob where they go to see Holden McNeil, played by Affleck, then man can't even play a character he has played before. The Holden that Jay and Silent Bob go to see is not the same from Chasing Amy, in fact I'm convinced that Jay and Silent bob ran into Ben Affleck in New Jersey. And from that scene advice three comes in from his own voice, Holden says I'm not interested in making money off Dick and Fart jokes&#133; Follow you own advise man. You can make movies that matter. People still talk about Chasing Amy and about how great and how honest it is. We love honesty; we can take a story about heartbreak a lot more than another joke about pot.Advice number four, We can never take enough Jason Lee. Give us more. Your Two best characters Brodie and Banky both played by Lee should have their own chance to shine, specially Banky who is such a endearing character. Mad is funny and Lee is the Olivier of Mad acting.Five and the most important advice I can give, believe in yourself. Jay and Bob reeks of insecurity. All of the jokes fall flat on its face just because you apologize for the fact that is not the greatest joke in the world. Just like you apologize for Mallrats what the f@(k is that about. F*(k them if they can take a joke. Just be funny, quote Star Wars, tell it from the heart and don't get involve in silly plots, they're unnecessary.And last, don't hate us for not being the most sophisticated audience out there. We can't help it.Lo  "},{"Title":"Review your library before seeing this film.","Date":"20 August 2001","Score":"","Genre":"Comedy","Review":"  There are way too many references, cameos and subtle jokes in this movie to not be intricately familiar with the previous four Smith films.

First of all, it focuses on our main characters throughout the entire movie, which are Mewes, Smith, Elizabeth, and Farrell. These four are fantastic together, especially Farrell who shows his versatility outside of the SNL audience and does a fantastic job.  Mewes is also top-notch as you see he finally reaches his peak as his performances have gotten significantly better throughout these movies.  Smith's facial expressions are funnier than any words he could utter, and Elizabeth is charming, yet sometimes awkward but fills her role to a tee.I think the one of the best things about this movie are the guest appearences.  Not only is every former character represented (except Caitlin Bree and Veronica), but the parts they are given are well suited.  Some characters have one liners and some, such as Affleck and Lee, are given entire scenes.Kevin Smith, in my opinion, is the next Scorcese.  Even though he plans on veering away from the New Jersey flicks, I will continue to watch his work. In the meantime, see this movie.

Others believed their movies were getting better and better. Still others said Chasing Amy was the closest they got to a real movie. All of us were at the premiere, and here's what we saw.First, this movie isn't for kids. There's more profanity than in South Park or an 80's Eddie Murphy standup routine. There're also more homosexual-bashing jokes than I expected, to the point that I cannot remember a single scene that didn't have one.That being said, this is also one of the funniest movies since American Pie or Road Trip, with good reason. Kevin Smith has asked, begged, cajoled, and blackmailed his friends into appearing in the film, and several times they actually poked fun at themselves about it. Cameos include actors from both American Pie & Road Trip, as well as all the previous J&SB movies, some playing multiple roles. Smith lets himself laugh at Hollywood in general and some of his favorite movies in particular. The good thing is that almost all of his humor can be taken strictly as jokes, with very little of it possibly being taken as insulting or offensive.The performances were incredible. Everyone really got into their roles and seemed to have a lot of fun with this film, especially as evidenced by the closing scenes. And as with all Smith movies, wait through the credits - you don't want to miss anything.Overall, while I thought Chasing Amy & Dogma had better stories, J&SB Strike Back definitely makes you laugh from start to finish.

When that day comes, I would be the first in line to support it, but it definitely wouldn't be for movies like this.  I suppose that if you keep making movies long enough, a really bad one is doomed to happen, but Kevin Smith should know better than this, and it's pretty sad to see something this stupid come from such a creative mind. While the plot involves Jay (Jason Mewes) and Silent Bob (Kevin Smith) traveling to Hollywood to keep a new movie about them from being made, it seemed like the plot was more of an elaborate excuse to throw in all of the old characters from Smith's previous movies.  Don't get me wrong now, Smith has had some great characters in the past, but cramming them all into one movie just isn't the right way to go about creating another good movie. Smith used just about every bad movie technique ever conceived of, except copying the fight scene from the Matrix, and it gets a little depressing at times.Perhaps the most ironic portion of the entire movie is that Jay and Silent Bob get very upset when they learn that people all over the world are writing nasty things about them on the internet.  If they thought there were a lot of bad things going around before, I can't wait to see what people are saying about them after this gets seen by a few people.  This is really one case where it seemed that Smith needed to make another movie but had no real good ideas for one.  He relied far too heavily on old characters instead of creating new ones, and far too much on Jason Mewes' potty mouth to carry them through a tough scene.  Instead of creating another memorable scene for the ages, he often relied on stupid one-liners or a celebrity cameo by one of his old friends.  There were quite a few funny moments scattered throughout the movie, but it didn't have quite the same feeling that Clerks or Dogma had going for them.  That said, it definitely made me want to watch Clerks again, and there was a very classic scene from Good Will Hunting 2, but there just wasn't enough to justify a whole movie.  I would like to say that Smith did an excellent of job of getting Ali Larter, Eliza Dushku and Shannon Elizabeth into tight leather, which would make for some excellent wallpaper on your computer.  For that we can be eternally grateful, but again, there just wasn't enough for a whole movie.  It was nice seeing Jason Biggs talk about his American Pie days, seeing what Scooby Doo has been up to lately, seeing Mark Hamill in a new role, and Shannon Elizabeth being referred to as Booboo Kitty F-ck, but there were just way too many things done wrong to compete with Smith's earlier work.  If you are new to the Jay and Silent Bob movies, this is definitely not the place to start as it feels more like a sequel to all of their other movies, rather than a movie of it's own.  If you absolutely love Kevin Smith, then you will easily find enough to keep you laughing, but it's nowhere near as good as his older stuff.

The lengthy monologues are cut down a bit (mostly due to the main characters--**Silent** Bob and Jay, who can't speak a sentence above an eighth-grade level), leaving the space to be filled by humor. Not that Smith's rambling style is gone, every main character gets at least one chance to rant a bit, even to the point of Holden McNeil (Ben Affleck) taking the words out of Smith the real life director's mouth.

I have seen all his movies over 10 times, listened to the commentaries multiple times, and have spent hundreds of dollars on Askew related merchandise.

Along the way they meet Jewel Thieves, a monkey named Suzanne, a wildlife marshal, and the most celebrity cameos I have ever seen in a movie.  What one has to realize going into this movie though, is that the plot is there only to give purpose.  This movie is basically laugh after laugh after laugh.  And the audience was just loving it.  I missed about half the lines in the movie due to the audiences laughter and my own.  I won't spoil any of the jokes in the movie, because then the movie won't be as fun.  It does help a lot if you have seen the first three Smith movies (Clerks, Mallrats, and Chasing Amy), because there are many many many references to them, and seeing all the characters on the screen together for one last movie was a joy.

If I need to introduce these characters any further, do NOT see this movie.The humor in this film is, in typical Smith fashion, pretty evenly split between foul and smart; most of it is either good-natured roasting of Miramax Studios and Smith & his films, or in-jokes between the characters of all of Smith's films, all of whom make at least a cameo in the film.  The entire film is just oozing with pop-culture, featuring references and parodies of films ranging from E.T. to American Pie; music references include everything from N.W.A. to Morris Day & The Time.The film quickly allows itself to become a game of counting pop-culture references, which is more fun than keeping up with the story, because there really isn't any.  What little plot there is concerns Jay and Silent Bob's discovery of a movie being made about them, and them going to Hollywood to stop it, wanting to get paid and, when they find out about the Internet and people on film site message boards talking trash, protect their reputation.  The plot goes all over the place from there, and everywhere our heros go, the pop-culture references are sure to follow, and the game of keeping track of them continues.As much as I enjoyed this film, only a few people were laughing at what I thought were the best jokes, and the reason for this is simple they don't get it.  Kevin Smith made this film for his rabid fans and fellow film geeks.  There is a little bit of slapstick and bathroom humor, but not enough to appease a mainstream audience.  Smith's use of self-parody is especially great, but if one doesn't have intimate knowledge of all of Smith's movies, the tons of in-jokes simply won't make any sense to them, and they'll end up disappointed.

It had the genius timing of Clerks, the hilarious slapstick from Mallrats, the abundance of gay jokes (which will be criticized) as from Chasing Amy, and a large cast of superstars inspired by Dogma.  This is indeed the ultimate Kevin Smith Movie.However, you may realize that by referencing all of his previous films, much of the Humor of Jay and Silent Bob may be lost.  So do not see this movie and say how stupid it was, because you will have no frame of reference. Please see Clerks, and Mallrats, etc. first.From the opening to closing credits, I stayed right in my seat.  The film keeps you on a constant high of laughs and gags.  This is the first movie that I've seen in a long time that kept me laughing for 2 straight hours. Remember how Jay would always interrupt a serious conversation with a great line in the previous films.  Every conversation is set up like that.I was even happy to see elements of the excellent, but under acclaimed, Clerks the Animated series tied into this film.  Especially Jay getting himself wound up in his own stupidity.Please see this excellent film, it is worth it just for a brief but hilarious Mark Hamil Cameo.

You don't need to have seen the previous films to enjoy the movie, but it will boost the laughs another 33%.  It also helps if you've seen Good Will Hunting, watched the Cartoon Network, and have a passing acquaintance with Star Wars, teen tv and movies and most of the box office hits of the past 30 years.  I lost count of how many of them Kevin lampoons, sweetly, of course.  Despite the obvious front layer of scatological humor, Kevin's films really are pretty sweet deep down.  As my significant other said it's a guy flick - but she was laughing almost  as often and hard as I was, and hasn't yet seen Clerks, Amy or Dogma - I managed to cram in synopses on the drive over.  The characters are all then need to be to feed situations and straight lines to Jay and Silent Bob, in that respect it's a sort of Blues Brothers, but substitute a couple of aimless stoners for Jake & Elwood.  Like a true comic book maven, Kevin includes an origins piece, and much to his credit - this tells you how much respect he's garnered - some very self-effacing cameos from all corners of media.  Don't know what he'll do next, but it's hard to imagine another production without Kevin/Silent Bob mugging it up under his own direction - and realize what a feat that is - to direct a coherent film that you yourself are in 90% of the shots! Thanks, Kevin - for this graduation present!

Also, Jason Mewes' performance was hilarious. if you watch clerks before this, you'll be able to see two totally different actors who just happen to have the same name. i didn't give it a 10 because a couple scenes were a little more cliched then you would expect from a writer as good as Smith.

But he's one of the most hilariously off-beat writers to come along in a long while, and it's still refreshing to see Jay & Silent Bob on the big screen.  The real paradox is that Smith manages to write some of the most verbally complex and even philosophically astute dialogue in Hollywood today, while still tossing out countless, as he puts it, d**k & fart jokes.  If you go for a bathroom break during this flick, you'll probably miss at least two cameos by very recognizable Hollywood stars, so make sure you've taken care of business before the previews start. There are also plenty of tributes to other movies, including references to each of Smith's first four New Jersey Chronicles.  For those unfamiliar with Jay & Silent Bob, some of those references will go unnoticed, but even newbies will bust a gut watching this movie.

The film is about the antics of their getting to Hollywood.This is probably one of the funniest movies I've seen in ages.  It has jokes throughout, and more jokes if you are familiar with the Kevin Smith's other films (Clerks, Mallrats, Chasing Amy, and Dogma).  There are, however, enough jokes that even if you haven't seen his other works, you should get a lot of the jokes.Perhaps one of the funniest things is the use of breaking the 4th wall. It is only done a couple times in the movie, but they are so funny, that you almost wish there were more.  For instance, near the beginning, Holden McNeil (played by Ben Affleck) says A Jay and Silent Bob movie?

In fact, I'd recommend that you see the previous four movies before seeing this film, otherwise you may be missing out on many jokes.  It can be likened to seeing the last episode of Seinfeld without watching any of episodes beforehand.  The best thing about this movie was how it incorporated gags and characters from the other movies (e.g.- Matt Damon complaining to Ben Aflek that he dragged him into acting in Dogma, Dante shouting I wasn't even supposed to be here today! while being tortured by apes, a Buddy Jesus statue in a nun's car).

I am first saddend because this is the finally of the Jersey series, and the final time we will actually see some of our favorite characters. In a way the fact that this is a finally to a series, eliminates those who had not faollowed the series to begin with. JaSBSB was so packed full of in jokes that the average viewer may feel lost. A Kevin Smith fan like myself was able to enjoy the movie much more thoroughly than my girlfriend who had only seen Clerks and Dogma. She still enjoyed the movie, but left without the full appreciation I had. What I must say about kevin Smith is that he has matured so much in his directing skills that This was probably his best directed film to date. It is a shame most of the movie was a ploy to fit in guest stars and in jokes rather than the thought provoking dialouge Smith is known for. The guest stars and in jokes worked though. I was suprised at the fact that certain celebs actually had cameos (I am not going to spoil who). The plot actually works as an old fashioned buddy movie, and Smith is great at exploring the man to man relationship, just in JaSBSB it is not explored as deeply. It is an ending though, and unlike Seinfeld, The Jersey Series ends on a note which would fans leaving with a smile, but the average man scratching his head. Do you think your a fan? if so..... 7=.... did you laugh if yes you'll love it. If no watch all the Kevin Smith cannon then go see it.

I saw the movie tonight at an advance screening in Indianapolis.  All I have to say is that WE should be thanking Kevin...AGAIN.  From the beginning to the very end (and I do mean very, after the credits is a little P.S.), I laughed so hard.  The story, as we all know, is that Jay and Silent Bob are trying to defend their good names by shutting down a movie version of Bluntman and Chronic.  That's as much of a story as you are going to get.  But let me tell you that if there was more of a story, it would only get in the way.  Kevin and Jason Mewes are absolutely hilarious in their final outing.  And the film does make a few jokes at Smith other movies, but a lot of the humor is based so that a complete idiot to the Askewniverse would kill themselves laughing.  So, Kevin Smith, from here on out, I'll be at every one of your films.  You are the best and freshest voices in cinema today.

Lots great guest appearances... But I've just lost my sense of humor for juvenile $%&#, and I (may be the only one who) thought this movie was full of it.It really isn't just Jay doing all the tits and fart/gay jokes- all the characters do. The only redemption occurs in a moment where James Van Der Beek accuses Jason Biggs of being a homophobe cause he always says that's so gay- but the scene ends with them both laughing about come on you know he likes his salami smoked or something. That's seriously the only moment in the movie a character is called on gay jokes.And women-objectifying- only once a character (Shannon Elizabeth) says (to Jay) you know women don't like to be called that, call them something more respectful and he says what, like Boo boo kitty f**k? and she smiles and goes that's a start! and for the rest of the movie that's her name.I think all Smith's movies were well-written, but he gives his voice to more or less every character (besides Jay, they have the same manner of speaking, adding SAT vocab words here and there).I wouldn't see it again, I can't say the same for Smith's dick and fart joke-loving fans.

Don't get the wrong idea, it's more than 'dick & fart' jokes -- it's also gay jokes -- lots of gay jokes.  More than that, it's a total send-up of Hollywood, particularly Miramax and it's image.  (I half expected cameos from the Weinsteins.)  The inside Hollywood jokes (which outnumber the crude jokes 51) will resonate with anyone who has seen any of the dozen movies they skewer during the course of J&SBSB.The movie should stand up to (and almost REQUIRES) multiple viewings, due to the pace of the dialog once the not-so-dynamic-duo actually get to hollywood -- which does take too long (my only complaint).IMHO, the funniest moments are provided by Matt Damon & Ben Affleck, as themselves making fun of each other's movie role choices, Chris Rock as the director of the Bluntman & Chronic movie, most of the cameos, and the several instances when the actors 'break the 4th wall' to question the intelligence of the audience or, in a particularly hilarious sequence, wreak vengence upon Internet geeks to would dare to say something negative about J&SB.Pretty much anyone with a decent sense of humor, or a humorous sense of decency, should see this movie.

I am a HUGE Kevin Smith fan, and expected another instant classic from the writer/director of Clerks, Mallrats, Chasing Amy, and Dogma.  I was not disappointed.  What makes Kevin Smith's movies so good is that he doesn't rely on cheap sight gags like other teen comedies, he writes brilliantly clever dialogue that leaves everyone rolling in the aisles with laughter.  Along with the rest of the fans at the sneak preview, I laughed for two hours straight.  In this road comedy, every scene is packed with laughter and one great cameo after another.  This movie follows two stoners, Jay and Silent Bob, on a trek to stop a movie about them from being made. With unforgettable stops along the way, especially smoking up in the Scooby Doo Mystery Van, this is the funniest movie in years! The cast in this movie is so packed, its hard to think of anyone that isn't in it.  With EVERYONE from all of Kevin Smith's past movies there are so many great characters that are woven into the story.  Thankfully many loose ends are tied up from past movies, like the monkey in the end of Mallrats.

Kevin Smith's Clerks was an unconventional low budget film whose insightful views, offbeat characters, and bizarre storyline enshrined him within the pantheon of independent moviemaking and spawned a legion of fans.  Smith's follow-up films, though unrelated, did have two low-key characters made cameos and provided comic relief   Jay the foul mouthed hormonally charged slacker and Silent Bob the mute sidekick (played by Smith himself).  The question is whether it is possible to construct an entire film around this dynamic duo.****************Caution  Possible Spoilers Ahead *********************Things are not going well for Jay and Silent Bob soon after being banned from hangin around the Quik Stop, they discover that Hollywood is making a movie based on characters based on them.  Their outrage is twofold  first because they've been cut out of the cash, but more importantly, a website devoted to movie gossip is predicting miserable failure for the film and is defaming them in particular.  Determined to save their names, they set out for Hollywood to stop the film from being made, and encounter some severely dysfunctional people along the way.After being deluged with hate mail for making  Dogma, Kevin Smith decided to return to his roots, and make another caustic, funny movie that people wouldn't take seriously and gave his two favorite characters center stage. The entire movie is essentially an in-joke - he specifically references his earlier movies dozens of times, lampoons Hollywood on every level, and has a great time doing it.  Smith makes no attempt to create a cohesive plot, as that would defeat the entire purpose of film which is to be as absurd as possible (in what other world would Shannon Elizabeth be attracted to a four letter spewing stoner?).  Adding to the fun are the numerous cameos - Chris Rock was my favorite - of which I quickly lost count.Although this is a watered down version of his earlier films, Smith's fans (I count myself among them) will enjoy this movie.  That said, I feel its necessary to issue this caveat - if you're not familiar with his films, or are sensitive to coarse or homophobic dialogue (done to show the ignorance of the character, but potentially offensive), check out America's Sweethearts instead.  This is not a movie for everyone.

More than that, I'm a fan of almost everything else he's done.  Comics, commentaries, soundtracks, even the Clerks cartoon.  (It was a lot better then anyone gave it credit for.)Many internet critics, even fans, have decided that Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back will only be found funny by those who are accquantied with other View Askew films; i.e. only hardcore fanboys (what we call ourselves) will get a kick out of this film.  After seeing an advance screening last night, though, I'd have to disagree whole-heartedly.True, many of the jokes and scenes in the flick have their basis in Smith's previous films but they are so simple, so basic that anyone can understand them.  Anyone can get them.  That's not to say everyone'll like them. Smith's brand of comedy does require a certain taste, but after you try it you're hooked.  There's no way a person can't laugh during this movie.The movie centers around Jay and Silent Bob, for the first time in any of Smith's films.  The two find out Miramax is making a movie based on their comic book alter-egos and that the royalties they usually recieve are not part of the deal.  They've been cut out completely.  On top of that, the duo discover the Internet and that opinionated youngsters are writing all sorts of crap about them.  Needless to say they're upset.  So they decide that the only logical thing to do is head for Hollywood and stop the production of the movie.Jay and Silent Bob are off and the audience settles in for a classic road movie, full of interesting characters and funnier situations the likes of which Hollywood hasn't seen in quite a while.  Some critics have decided that the plot is thin and maybe it is, but despite it's lack of substance the plot is always right there, ever-moving the picture forward.I have to say again that this movie is, from start to finish, the most most hilarious you'll see this summer; if not in the past few years.  Who am I kidding?  The past decade.  True, some of the jokes are gay related, the whole movie is, but those who chastise Smith for gay-bashing don't realize that the majority of the time the jokes are at the expense of the two main characters, even more often directed at Smith's Silent Bob.  So take it in stride.  Get the joke.I higly recommend seeing this picture.  It's great.  You'll never laugh as hard.  Even if you've never seen a View Askew movie or if you've seen them all and hate them all, see this movie.  It's a breath of fresh air in this summer of comedies that just don't live up to the original and action blockbusters that are so void they make the Grand Canyon look like an empty Dixey cup.

Even _Clerks_, for all its snarky witticisms, had something to say. You could also tell that Kevin Smith knows his fans are mostly young guys, judging by the overly-long Charlie's Angels-style segments.

It's not that funny.  Jay and Silent Bob are really getting old. I thought they were funny in high school, and their continued reappearance on the big screen would always provide a good amount of actual comedy.  But there's no excitement left.  Jason Mewes has a lot of energy, and that's fun to watch, but it would be nice to see him play off some real personalities like he did in their other movies.

This was nothing new for me, when I saw American Pie 2 last week, the credits were not on that one either. I will try and not spoil this too much, but the movie starts with Jay and Silent Bob as kids outside their favorite convenience store.  One of their mothers starts cussing like crazy because a guy gives her a hard time for leaving her kids by themselves for a few minutes.  Kid Jay starts to cuss as soon as the mom walks away.  Then we jump to the present, again, in front of the convenience store and Jay and Silent Bob are hanging out and eventually get kicked off the property and arrested.  They find out that a movie is being made about their very successful comic, Bluntman and Chronic, and they have to find a way to get from New Jersey to Hollywood to stop the movie from being made.  Along the way of hitchhiking, we meet Justice (Shannon Elizabeth) and her gang of girls.  They turn out not to be who we think they really are.  When they end up in Colorado, Justice talks the guys into breaking into a place to steal a monkey.  The girls have another agenda which I won't spoil.  The guys make their way to Hollywood and the cops are out to find them because of this monkey they took.  They work their way into the set of their movie, and get themselves in the movie.  The funny part is they are shooting this movie without a script.  This leads to a fairly predicable ending but it was still hilarious.There are so many cameo's in this movie, I won't list them all because it would spoil it.  Silent Bob does speak a few lines.  There were times I was laughing so hard I almost cried.  The movie is 1 hr. 41 minutes long but it didn't seem like it.

This is a comedy that guys between 15-30 will enjoy the most. Sex and drug jokes come from all directions ranging from slightly harmless to highly offensive. Think of it as a Mallrats 2, since Smith is already planning an animated Clerks film. The part of the movie that made me enjoy it so thoroughly was the hilarious Jason Mewes.

No issues. Just a big joke, a big laugh.' Judging by the enthusiasm of the crowd in the press screening in LA on June 27th, he has succeeded. The familiar characters are all greeted like old friends. Laughs abound. The film has only a thin plot-line, but who cares. Jay and Silent Bob find out their alter egos 'Bluntman and Chronic' will be used in a movie without their consent, and they set off from New Jersey to Hollywood to sabotage the project. On the way, they hitch rides from a nun (Carrie Fisher), the cast from 'Scooby Doo', and four 'Charlie's Angels'-like girls who use the guys as patsy's for a diamond heist. Smith digresses from the story at will. He introduces a mad Wildlife Ranger, who pursues them; he used a monkey (pardon an ape) in his comics and so hey there's a urangutan in J&SBSB. If their is a more laid-back film I haven't seen it. Smith does what he pleases, sticks to a very simple style of directing and lets his actors have fun. All cameos are funny; all gags seem to have to do with oral sex and Jay, especially, has no 'moral barometer' to keep him from saying the most outrageous and 'incendiary' s***. Even when the film is not funny, it is still a peg or two above your average adolescent jerk-off summer movie (American Pie, Legally Blonde, Scary Movie 2). Why? Because every detail of the film, however crude or obscene, proves that Smith is a man who is thoroughly in love with the world, the world of Quick Stops and comics and Star Wars. This love is unusual. It can be felt; it proves that Smiths film are not really frivolous or camp. He really cares. In my book, that puts him on a page with Woody Allen, or Warhol, or Lenny Bruce. Undoubtedly, Smith will now 'grow up'. Heaven knows what he'll do next. He mentioned 'a serious Woody Allen-September movie', a film without the Jay and Silent Bob safety net. I'll be there.

I will not deny that Clerks. is a good film that is witty and realistic but at the same time careful and unpredictable. Then came Mallrats which made me think that if Smith wants to make films about nothing in particular that aren't funny then so be it. Dogma was about something but still rubbish and although I'm yet to see Chasing Amy, Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back suggests to me that it'll just be more of the same garbage.The film is an absolute no-go zone in terms of anything. I will go so far to say that the only interesting thing to come out of this film is the way the Miramax studio idea towards the end is played with &#150; other than that, Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back is an unnecessary and unfunny film that was probably the inspiration for Epic Movie (2007) in fact it's sort of Epic Movie meets Last Action Hero. I find it fitting that the song playing over the end credits is 'Because I got High' by Afroman because the film is a total trip for all the wrong reasons. Smith starts off his journey of disaster that is Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back by breaking the fourth wall (a tiresome gag) and mixing up real life characters with fictional characters within the film. He even makes the genius, genius decision of actually insulting his viewers very early on by reminding them just what lousy humour they've all been laughing at for the last seven years. Yes Kevin, many people have but you know what?

The film was rated 'R' in America and '18' here in England which suggests who it's aimed at &#150; they were going for an adult audience. However, watching a deluded drug dealer's sexual fantasy as he dreams about kissing a random girl as she walks into a burger joint and then publicly re-enacts a sex act as he's still dreaming is perhaps the worst example of brainless, sexist comedy. His accomplice places a cup over his groin but he still manages to 'fill it'. Smith also thinks that including multiple scenes of swearing and toilet humour as well as getting girls to appear in flashes of their bras as well as in PVC catsuits will get bums on seats and he's right; only to a very, very premature and basic audience. It's sad when a filmmaker has to stoop so low in order to get a fan following going.The word 'needless' is pretty much applicable to most of this film. It's plot about Jay and Bob travelling to Hollywood to stop a piracy production is average enough but the whole detour involving the 'animal rights activists' is just an excuse to include more failed humour. It was needless to have all three girls leap over the security beams once at the warehouse and of course, there's no CCTV watching them or alarms to go off once a window or a glass case has been broken. Was the film even thought through or does Smith really think that less of his audience. There is a reason to smile once Jay and Bob get to the film studio with numerous film stars being upstaged and previous films being mocked &#150; American Pie and Reindeer Games my favourites but at this point in the film the damage has already been done and the horrible, horrible climax will leave a very bad taste in the mouth as will the way everybody finishes the film (wait for it)........dancing!? I tell you, if anybody else other than Smith made this film everybody and I mean everybody would just laugh AT him and ignore him for the rest of his career &#150; two things I am now having to contemplate.

Now, they get their own movie, and from the start you get an idea of how it's gonna be we learn they were abandoned outside the infamous Quick Stop store as kids, which explains why they've been hanging there ever since (we also find out Jay inherited his foul mouth from his mom). Until Randal (Jeff Anderson) and Dante (Brian O'Halloran) file a restraining order against them. What could have been a bad day turns even worse when comic book geek Brodie Bruce (Jason Lee) tells them Miramax, no longer making just good movies, is adapting Bluntman and Chronic, which is based on them. The bad thing about it is, not only won't they be paid a cent, but a lot of people are posting offensive stuff about them on the Internet. What else can they do, if not go to Hollywood and stop the filming?Well, they could ignore the whole thing, since, according to Holden McNeil (Ben Affleck), no one is gonna watch a movie called Jay and Silent Bob (as soon as he says it, all three of them look straight into the camera, causing a few laughs), but since Jay is incredibly stubborn, they're gonna attack Miramax anyway. And steal a monkey on the way, with a federal wildlife marshal (Will Ferrell) coming after them. And get accused of being terrorists, so no one will bother four female jewel thieves the two idiots inadvertently helped.The plot is a bit more complex than usual, considering who's directing the film, and that's actually the movie's main weakness (the other being the unnecessary presence of certain actors, like Jason Lee, whose material isn't juicy enough) had Smith left out the monkey and thieves subplot (although Ferrell is undeniably funny, especially in the Fugitive spoof) and focused on the main story alone, the film would have been more accessible and enjoyable. In fact, once Jay and Bob reach Hollywood, there's a lot of fun to be had. Highlights include Ben Affleck and Matt Damon shooting Will Hunting 2 (oh my God), a priceless Star Wars parody with Mark Hamill playing a Sith with an unwritable name (arguably the film's best scene), and much, much more, all given more poignancy by Smith's trademark profane dialogue. Those looking for intelligent movie-mocking (not Scary Movie) will be very satisfied by this comedy.So, who is this movie aimed at? Well, Smith fans, certainly. Film buffs, of course. Oh, and anyone wondering why a studio would finance a comedy which makes fun of that very same studio (that's actually kind of weird). "},{"Title":"Hilarious Dialogue","Date":"9 March 2006","Score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy","Review":" In Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back, director Kevin Smith manages a better Scream spoof than any of the Scary Movie films, more references to Star Wars than a Star Wars film, and a better performance by Ben Affleck than any other film he has starred in. What's even more amazing is that each of these triumphs are no more than a scene each. What this goes to show is that Kevin Smith is as witty and sharp as ever. On the Surface, Jay and Silent Bob... may look like a brainless parade of coarse language and silly facial expressions, but it is far more intelligent than that. The film is a clever parade of View Askew in jokes, movie references and a complete bashing of Hollywood. The pairing of Jay and Silent Bob is stronger than it has been in any of Smith's previous films, and their relationship is pure classic comedy, which is amazing considering that one of them barely speaks. After the controversial but brilliant Dogma, Smith wanted to make a controversy free caper starring the most prominent characters of his franchise, at the same time burying the characters of Jay and Silent Bob. This film is the first chance that Jason Mewes, after years of criticism by movie distributors, gets to display what he is capable of to full effect. There is very little dialogue of his that isn't hilarious at the very least. The clever narrative makes for a wonderful comic caper, with the hilarious slapstick of a more extreme Laurel and Hardy or Blazing Saddles. Jay and Silent Bob's most enjoyable scene is the self - berating Matt Damon and Ben Affleck making a sequel to Good Will Hunting, whilst criticising each other's films between takes. It is Hollywood spoofs like this, with big names like Ben and Matt, Jason Biggs and even Wes Craven playfully making jokes of their own work, that makes Jay and Silent Bob... an impeccable piece of film making from Smith. The performances by Jason Mewes, Will Ferrel and Chris Rock are some of the funniest you'll ever see, and to top it all off, the return of Clerk's Randall and Dante, and Jason Lee's character from Mallrats make for charming nostalgia. Thank God Jay and Silent Bob are back for Clerks 2!

It's also the most comedic. Jay and Silent Bob finally have their own movie, and as a Smith fan, I ate it up. I was really excited to see this. I died laughing, even though it is one of Smith's weaker films. But saying that a Kevin Smith comedy is bad, is basically saying that it's a hilarious movie, that's better than many comedies out there. This movie, happens to deliver more big laughs per minute than most of those Adam Sandler comedies.In this one, Jay (Jason Mewes) and Silent Bob (Kevin Smith) discover that a movie based on their superhero likenesses, Blumtman and Chronic, is being made, and they're not being paid a dime. To make matters worse, they are being bashed on the internet. In an attempt to stop the movie, the dim-witted duo hit the road for Hollywood to stop the movie from being made.That's the only plot there is. They encounter various misadventures, including a band of diamond thieves, including Justice (Shannon Elizabeth), who Jay falls for, and she naively fails to notice that all Jay talks about is having sex with her and she finds him sweet. She is a good girl type, who you couldn't imagine doing all the things Jay says he wants to do to her. They also encounter a hitchhiker played by George Carlin, who's philosophy about hitchhiking is a perfect setup for a joyously vulgar gag involving a nun. Jay and Silent Bob also steal a monkey. This movie is far more stupid than Kevin's other movies. While many will find his other movies boring, this one is one that everyone will enjoy. Everyone who's old enough to see it, at least. This movie features literally constant use of the f-word, and has many obscene sexual gags. It's all really funny. The movie is also one that probably shouldn't be seen if you haven't seen Kevin Smith's first four movies, as several of the jokes involve references to the previous works. Fans will eat this up. Characters from the first four show up frequently. Jason Lee shows up in this movie as Brodie Bruce from Mallrats, and Banky Edwards from Chasing Amy. Ben Affleck shows up as Holden McNeil from Chasing Amy (Holden actually mentions Ben Affleck at one moment), and then he shows up later as himself, where he and Matt Damon are making fun of each other's careers. Jason Biggs shows up in a hysterical cameo, and truly sums up his career in a hilarious reference to American Pie. Jay is still one of the funniest characters ever, and with his mouth that is so filthy it would have Cartman telling him to watch his mouth, makes me hope for a sequel where Jay goes to meet Justice's uptight parents. While it will never happen, Jay is a great character for a situation like that.One thing should also be put out there. This is Will Ferrell's most underrated performance ever. He plays a silly role that's minor and significant at the same time, as a federal wildlife Marshall, who is after the monkey that Jay and Silent Bob stole. Hearing Will Ferrell deliver Kevin Smith's traditional vulgar dialogue is a nice change from those other comedies he's done. If you like Will Ferrell's brand of humor, and aren't easily offended, then this movie is an absolute must see.So if you're a fan of Kevin Smith (or Will Ferrell), then I highly recommend this It is rated R for Non-Stop Crude and Sexual Humor, Pervasive Strong Language, and Drug Content.

There's no big religious message here, like in Dogma. No big picture relationship truths like in Chasing Amy. The action sequences aren't even as fun as the disappointing Mallrats, and nothing can touch the simple brilliance of Clerks. As a stand-alone film, Jay and Silent Bob Strikes back can't possibly compare.I won't bother going into the ludicrous plot, and the acting isn't meant to be good here. But it's in the endless cameos, references, connections and inter-connections that the humour is truly born here. This is a funny movie that's made for the inside group of fans who have followed these characters through four movies, and it's the perfect sign-off to the rude, crude View Askewniverse before Smith hangs up his trench coat and moves on.

Instead of writing thoughtful, funny stories about human relations, he's become part of the pathetically self-referential and self-absorbed world of hip Hollywood.  Some of the defining characteristics of this group are insular neuroticism, obsession with image and media-friendly vapidness.  I wasn't surprised to see SNL members in this movie, SNL long ago stopped being original and creative and is now just a bankrupt, cynical and stupid venue for untalented people performing mean spirited parody.  Unfortunately, Smith seems to be following suit.  The formula seems to be get a bunch of stars, make some ass jokes, fire off incessant homophobic slurs (offensive not necessarily because of their intent but because of their Pavlovian frequency as a tool to get a cheap laugh), get some busty babes, smoke some weed, and you've got yourself a movie that goes over big with prepubescent boys, which is the only thing nearly anyone in movies these days cares about anyway.

There have been countless contenders for worst film of the year as to date, but do any of them compare with this movie? Even Pootie Tang, Joe Dirt, and Saving Silverman displayed a greater level of intelligence than this worthless, pointless sack of cow dung. They portrayed human beings and showbiz as harmless, sweet nature elements of modern culture.Jay and Silent Bob doesn't even do that. Kevin Smith, director of such overrated raunchy comedies like Chasing Amy, Clerks, and Dogma, have directed a movie here beyond average human comprehension. It is not possible for any mature, civilized member of society to connect with such a brainless mess of dirty jokes and crude humor. No intellectual moviegoer will laugh at the mind-numbing array of insults and circumstances that transpire on screen.I guess you can call this a movie, but it's more like an experiment of immature filmmakers mocking themselves. You would get the same quality of filmmaking if you gave a bunch of eighth graders a professional movie camera and sound equipment, and told them to run off and have fun. The only difference is that these guys are big stars with big bucks-and the eighth graders might be smarter.Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back contains many, many familiar names in the cast list-shame on all of them. Famous, appreciated actors, directors, writers, and singers show their faces to these moronic filmmakers who simply want to exploit their unfunny, dysfunctional sense of humor to American masses.  Some of the material has satirical potential; it's fun to watch these celebrities making fun of their own cinematic body of work. Unfortunately the needless foulness and inanity of this movie destroy any fun ironies or effective moments. Not even fans of Smith's previous work will appreciate this ugly, unpleasant trash.The plot Jay (Jason Mewes), a puke-inducing, profanity spewing pothead, and his friend Silent Bob (Kevin Smith), who seldom says a word, learn that a Bluntman and Chronic movie is in the production process. The movie contains characters based on their comic book counterparts, and they have not received a dime in royalties yet. The two drug buddies venture across America to sabotage the movie at all costs. Along with way, they try to give a nun oral sex, make friends with an orangutan, fall in love with beautiful jewel thieves, smoke some joints with Scooby Doo and friends, interrupt various movies in the making, and even fight Mark Hamill in a retarded Star Wars spoof.The characters recite their dialogue as if they are detached to everything around them. They need to wake up and realize they're on planet earth. I am not immune to laughing at dirty jokes about sex and drugs, but they need to be funny. Acting stupid on camera is not funny. We learned that after Freddie Got Fingered. Humor can evolve from sex, drugs, nudity, and parody, but actors pretending to be stupid people who discuss such things in front of a camera operator just doesn't  tickle our funny bones. The humor in this concept would be in Jay and Bob's realization of social maturity-there is potential in a well-written script on these ideas. Too bad the movie simply introduces more stupid characters, time and time again, providing us with more and more unfunny, wasted material.  It takes the wrong approach entirely.What's with Kevin Smith's obsession with the f word? Does he think it's funny to say the f word. This movie contains nonstop usage of the notorious phrase, in every conceivable style and sentence, probably over three hundred times. It serves no purpose here. Profanity can be beneficial to movies, especially during moments of extreme tension or anger, for character development, or if given the perfect comic timing. The f word itself does not evoke laughs. In Jay and Silent Bob, a baby, probably not even a year old, utters several of those expletives. That's not funny. It's alarming, unsettling that we, as a society, have come so low that our sense of humor now revolves around four letter words projected from the mouths of infants. How sad to laugh at such disturbing material.I could go on and on about this movie. My warnings go out to you all nobody deserves to sit through this movie. However, here's the funny thing. The screening where I saw Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back was a sellout performance. Fans of Jay and Bob were literally standing in the aisles because there were not enough seats for those who decided they would sneak into the showing. Throughout the film, the entire audience was in stitches-laughing hysterically. Did I miss the joke. I don't think so-I was watching the same movie. I just have a higher standard of humor for myself than laughing at a movie that insults me and its own kind. If your idea of a good time is to do drugs and frankly discuss sexuality with others, than this might just be your movie. I left the theater feeling sad and angry.

It was mildly funny the first time it was done, but by the THIRD time they do it, you just want to cry.  Kevin Smith maintains his love of dirty humor, something I've felt has always detracted from his otherwise hilarious films.  This time around though, nothing is shocking and it adds to the sense of dated humor seen already in teen gross-out comedies.  Hell, he even has 2 American Pie stars in the film.

Jay and Silent Bob, the ever-present stoners from Kevin Smith's four New Jersey films, are back and in fine form in Smith's fifth film, `Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back.'When they find out that they are not getting royalties on a movie called `Bluntman and Chronic,' a comic book they inspired, they go to Hollywood to stop the film's production. Along the way they hook up with a foursome of diamond-stealing girls, a nun, Scooby-Doo and the Gang, and an orangutan named Susanne (you'll remember her from the last scene of `Mallrats.') Many old characters return, including Dante, Randal, Holden, Brodie, and Banky (Jason Lee in a double role). It's got the feel of the last episode of `Seinfeld,' and will certainly be funnier if you've seen the previous four movies. Kevin Smith has taken the old saying `Half the fun of the trip is getting there' to the extreme, as some scenes have no bearing on the film's outcome, but are just fun. The film doesn't deal with relationships, homosexuality, or religion, or any other topic from the other films. Instead it sets out on being fun from the first scene to the last. It pays homage to the series' characters, mocks Hollywood, and gives Jay and Silent Bob a forum for their comic skills. Fans of the duo will get their fill of `nooch,' `snoogins,' and `fatty-boom-batty blunts,' something they haven't gotten since `Mallrats.'`J&SBSB' is the final chapter for Jay and Silent Bob, as Smith is retiring the characters. Jay was out of control in `Clerks,' but has been tamed (relatively speaking) since then. However, Smith held nothing back in writing Jay's lines this time around, as he let Jason Mewes go to the ceiling with his alter ego. Almost every word out of his mouth is dirty, and we even see in the first scene that his mother was no speech saint herself. The movie can be shocking at times, but not to anyone who loves and know Smith's work. The reintroduction of old characters, especially Dante and Randal from `Clerks,' receives loud cheers and applause from the audience, and each joke from a previous film is treated like a favorite uncle you haven't seen in a while. That is one of the beauties of the film the more you like Smith, the more you like this movie.

Whatever takes the attention off Kevin Smith and his own creations. Hence the problem is that this picture is a complete nothing aside from a few admittedly funny cameos performed by Matt Damon, Ben Affleck and Chris Rock.

I can not imagine being paid enough to participate in it.  If I were to quote the anti-gay terms used in the film, they would be censored by imdb.com, yet they saw fit to condone use of these terms.The film's plot involves a cross-country trip to avenge Miramax for using characters inspired by them in a film.  So naturally they have to (1) ridicule the concept of gays marrying, (2) call gays every evil name in the book every 5 minutes along the way, (3) tell everyone along the way that they are NOT gay, God forbid, (4) use the phrase That was so GAY every 5 minutes, and (5) also glorify drugs along the way.

It takes place in the same world as Clerks., Mallrats, Chasing Amy and Dogma. It features, besides Jay and Silent Bob, many of the characters that feature in those previous films as well as featuring cameos from a slew of other famous names and faces.After watching Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back (I'm just going to call it Strike Back from now on), I just wasn't sure how I felt about this film. On one hand, it's hilarious; from start to finish, Strike Back features some true gems of comedy.. Even better, the film features Jay and Silent Bob in the leads and after four films where they were featured in the sidelines, its great to see them again where they do a great job throughout as the leads of the film. Ben Affleck, Matt Damon, Carrie Fisher, George Carlin, Chris Rock and Mark Hamill amongst many others make some really amusing cameos. And I can't not mention how sexy both Eliza Dushku and Shannon Elizabeth look in this film.Smith's dialogue really is great in this film. With in-jokes about Hollywood, celebrities making fun of themselves, and some real obscure situations that Strike Back puts the characters in, the viewer is sure to have a good time. Now I say that the writing is fantastic and the humour is laugh out loud funny and it is true, but like Dogma and Mallrats, Smith throws in some real juvenile humour that just doesn't fit into the rest of the film. His tendency to include an over abundance of poop jokes really brings down the level of his films (which is one of the main reasons why Chasing Amy shines over all other Kevin Smith productions).Unlike Dogma, the poop jokes aren't the only thing that brings down Strike Back. With Chasing Amy, Smith showed a maturity that wasn't in his two films. He showed he was growing as a director. Then with Dogma, he bloomed. Dogma looked phenomenal, was striking in it's colours and sets and special effects, and the camera no longer just shot the scenes it became an integral part of the film bringing the viewer into the story and making them feel for the characters. But his direction here seems to revert back to his Mallrats days, and after watching Dogma, it is such a disappointment. The static photography that I hoped was gone was back, and with so much action and movement in the story, it really made the film feel flat. It should have looked and felt like Dogma, but instead we the viewer are kept at a distance from everything that we experience on screen. It makes the film feel choppy, as if we are watching a bunch of scenes haphazardly put together, instead of a well made cohesive story.But, I digress. Poop jokes and shoddy direction aside, Strike Back is well worth watching if you want to laugh straight for just shy of two hours. If you take the funniest parts of Clerks., Mallrats, Chasing Amy and Dogma and string them together, you still won't laugh as hard as you do in this movie.

If you don't like Jay and Silent Bob or dumb stoner comedies, then this movie is not for you. If you do, it's the best of them all. This movie follows the plot of Mallrats and Chasing Amy, which are also funny movies with nearly the same cast.Once Jay and Silent Bob set out, to stop the Bluntman and Chronic movie at Miramax studios, you know their going to cause chaos. Then they meet with group of sexy diamond thieves, which only means one thing Snoochie Boochies.During the film they make a lot of references to how a movie with Jay and Silent Bob would be horrible, and nobody would spend their money to see it. At the same time their looking back at the camera and audience, which is ironic and kinda funny. Kevin Smith or Silent Bob hit gold, by making this low production film so damn funny. This is my favorite Jay and Silent Bob film, and a hope one day Kevin Smith decides to make another.

You know who you are.Our heroes are Jay (played by Jason Mewes, a real life stoner), an archetypal pot-head moulded after Sean Penn's character in Fast Times at Richmond High, and Silent Bob, his chubby hetero life-mate. Our duo get into crazy adventures, run into equally odd characters, and of course eventually emerge victorious. Smith satirizes his Miramax financiers (via many Ben Affleck and Matt Damon jokes), Hollywood conventions (a monkey subplot pokes fun at Hollywood market researchers and dumb Going to Hollywood parables), treats his geeky audience to much female eye-candy, and of course many Star Wars, superhero, comic-book and filmdom in-jokes (everything from Scooby Doo to American Pie), all the while rolling out a string of big Hollywood cameos (including directors like Wes Craven and Gus Van Sant), the best of whom is probably Chris Rock, who plays an angry movie director (modelled on Spike Lee) who advocates pro-white slavery. The film is consistently funny if you like this type of humour, but lacks the gravity of Smith's best films (Chasing Amy and Dogma).The buddy/stoner comedy has been around since the 1970s (the Cheech and Chong movies), but few have any artistic merit. Robert Altman tried to make a high-brow stoner movie with O.C and Stiggs, but that misfired completely. Perhaps the classiest films in this genre are The Big Lebowski and Bad Santa, both written by the Coen brothers. These ultra low-brow genres are typically avoided by auteurs.Unlike Smith's other films, Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back flows well, seems less dialogue/monologue heavy, has about a thousand more jokes and keeps these jokes flowing hard and fast. The film's last act in particular, inspired by Pee-wee's Big Adventure, offers a barrage of giggles.8.5/10 &#x96; Worth multiple viewings.

I consider this the last, original and yet superb Kevin Smith movie. While some of his later work impresses me, he seems now to do what he thinks would sell rather than the original, catchy, and low budget stuff he wants to make. The best Kevin Smith movies are easily Clerks, Mallrats, and Chasing Amy his first three films all having a small budget and all being extremely well written with dialog and various scenes that are very funny. There's also a love story in everyone of those movies, while different, with the most unique story being in Chasing Amy all the stories are very original and not anything you would see made nowadays. They have a very original and true feel to them. Its like people actually talking not acting.While the f word is uttered more time in this movie than a bar, it has very humorous and clever moments in the film as well as enjoyable and unexpected cameo scenes that fit nicely in the plot. I enjoyed seeing Dante Hicks, Randal Graves, Holden McNeil, and Brodie Bruce all return in this film. Even for a brief moment, I still enjoyed seeing their faces. I love all the characters and was happy to see Smith finally decided to bring them back in another movie. It was like an apology in 2001 for not having a Clerks or Chasing Amy sequel at the time.Jay and Silent Bob (played by Jason Mewes and director Kevin Smith) are infuriated to find out that a movie based on the comic book characters they were the basis for is being made by Miramax and they haven't received a movie check or credit for the characters (Bluntman and Chronic). They both set out to Hollywood to collect there mother...movie check and teach those Miramax.... a thing or too. Jay meets Justice (Shannon Elizabeth) who he falls for, but is unaware she is on the hunt to steal diamond from a diamond depositary with her girlfriends Sissy (Eliza Dushku), Missy (Jennifer Schwalbach), and Chrissy (Ali Larter). Jay and Silent Bob now become deeper in hot water then they've ever been at the Quick Stop.Notably by the top notch cameras being improved (rather than the Super16 and cheapo cameras Smith had shot Clerks and Chasing Amy with) have vanished and now we have a solid budget of $22 million and a cast of cameos like Ali Larter, Sean William Scott, and Will Ferrell we can say that Mr. Kevin Smith is not the low budget film director we knew, he's changed his ways and his now on to do other newer and more pricey things. Nothing wrong with a filmmaker improving on his films, but doesn't any else find it funny that the movies he makes nowadays like the pricey hits we know as Cop Out, Jersey Girl, and Zack and Miri Make a Porno aren't as brought up and praised as much as the classics like Clerks, Mallrats, and Chasing Amy? Its like that the stuff he did with a rock bottom, nowhere budget works are ten times better than the things with a bigger budget.Still, Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back is well played and well acted. There are some scenes that haven't sat right with me since the first viewing, like mainly the homosexual humor and other little things, but without a doubt, Kevin Smith impresses here, and really goes all out to show the stoners we love on the big screen. The jokes are funny and most fit nicely. Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back maybe the last classic, but it comes off as a respectable close to the View Askew bests.Starring Jason Mewes, Kevin Smith, Shannon Elizabeth, Will Ferrell, Eliza Dushku, Ali Larter, Jennifer Schwalbach Smith, Brian O'Halloran, Jeff Anderson, Ben Affleck, and Jason Lee.

Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back is here and as funny as can be. Portraying the title characters (Jason Mewes and Kevin Smith) trying to stop Hollywood from making an illegal movie based on their lives, the movie is basically a joke every minute. Probably the funniest aspect is the way that various people appear in the movie making fun of their roles in other movies (check out Matt Damon's and Ben Affleck's appearance).I should warn you that this is not a movie for prudes. The George Carlin scene will particularly rile such people, as will the whole part about the clit. But Kevin Smith's fans are sure to love this movie. Also starring in hilarious roles are Will Ferrell, Shannon Elizabeth, Carrie Fisher, Chris Rock, and several others (I did what the movie commanded when a certain Star Wars cast member appeared).

The movie will entertain fans of Smith's work - non-fans will find it to be rather crude (too crude, perhaps) but I nevertheless found it to be quite entertaining.Plus, you get to stare at Shannon Elizabeth in a tight leather suit for a majority of the film's runtime, which can't be TOO bad.

Mostly, it focused around incredibly socially acceptable behavior framed by pretty well written dialog. i might not find it that great today, but i know why i liked it a few years ago.unfortunately, that is exactly what JASBSB seems to lack. by the time it came out, everyone knew about Kevin Smith, Jay and Silent Bob, and who they were. this was in every sense a mainstream movie, and you could clearly tell. unlike directors like Charlie Kaufman who keep the originality that made them famous, Smith seemed to have lost that in JASBSB.i can't think of any specific examples right now, because I don't like being in Nebraska - it makes my head hurt - except, i suppose the role of Will Farrell. there's just no way to lay claim to the role of underground, socially divergent humor when you've got the latest SNL comedy spawn in your movie. Water Boy and the upcoming Taxi definitely aren't the most novel concepts - neither was Jay and Silent Bob.My point is, with this movie, Smith lost what made him good to begin with - a movie that runs against the current of what is normal and expected. a sort of counterculture comedy that rejects what we take for granted to create humor. on that front JASBSB doesn't challenge the mainstream any more than Ace Ventura (which actually is very funny by the way). The point is...he's not naughty anymore - just kind of blah.but that's just my opinion.

It is a pity that he besmirched himself with this scatological trash.  Smith has included vignettes with Jay (Jason Mewes) and Silent Bob (Kevin Smith himself) in most of his films to add comic relief.  These characters became his trademark and they developed a cult following.  Smith was inundated with requests to expand the characters and feature them in a film.  Unfortunately, he capitulated, and this fatuous film is the result.This film is targeted at boys 14 to 19 years old, most of whom were precluded from seeing it because of its R rating.  As a result, the box office was disappointing.  Most of the film is jejune, with occasional glimpses of Smith's comedic genius peeking out from the imbecilic slapstick humor and the tsunami of profane language and crude sex jokes.Smith has given us insightful comedies such as `Chasing Amy' and `Dogma' that are both thoughtful and funny.  In this film, he is a good sport and pokes fun at himself and the actors, particularly Ben Affleck who berates himself constantly.  The movie parodies sprinkled throughout the film are innovative and humorous, taking pot shots and his films and other blockbusters such as `Star Wars', `Scream', `ET', and `Batman'.  However, whatever comedic value these skits had was negated by the completely pointless script and the vulgar and boorish behavior of Jason Mewes, who spewed profanity literally every other word.From an acting perspective this ensemble cast is nothing more than a Kevin Smith reunion party, with most of the actors having worked with him before.  Cameos abound.  As for the main characters, Kevin Smith is always excellent as Silent Bob.  He is a master of facial expressions and physical comedy.  Jason Mewes is not really an actor.  He has little on his resume other than playing Jay for Kevin Smith.  All that can really be said of him is that he has an incredible ability to behave like a foul-mouth teenager, despite the fact that he is approaching 30.This film is a temptation that Kevin Smith should have resisted.  It is puerile and disjointed with little redeeming value other than the movie parodies.  I rated it a 3/10.  It will have appeal to certain pubescent boys, but to anyone else it is likely to be a vile and offensive experience.

The basic plotline for his breakthrough hit Clerks was a lot like this short play I wrote in the late eighties. No, he didn't steal it from me (although we're both Jersey boys!), but still they were eerily similar. Oh, and he's a huge movie buff, too - check out all of his in-jokes and clever casting. There's a decided New Jersey edge to his movies, which is always cool.The characters of Jay and Silent Bob have appeared in each of Smith's movies, played by Jason Mewes and Smith himself. They're great characters, because while the plots of the movies change, they don't. And they're well characterized, too; even though Jay's coarse language would put a longshoreman to shame, he's caustically funny, obscene but hilarious. And Bob - well, he's silent, except for one soliloquy in each movie. He's the conscience of the picture, y'see. And Smith's perfect for his own role.So finally the two get their own movie, begging the question Are the characters strong enough to warrant their own film? Could they carry it?Answer Hell, yeah.Jay and Silent Bob, who have been barred via restraining order from hanging out in front of the convenience store in Clerks, find out that a comic book based on them is being made into a movie. Now, you and I might want a piece of that movie pie, but Jay and Silent Bob are more concerned with the plethora of insults being hurled at them on the Internet, mainly by overactive teenagers. So they set off on a cross-country crusade to stop the film at all costs.Actors who have appeared in previous Smith films, including Ben Affleck, Matt Damon, George Carlin, Joey Lauren Adams, Brian O'Halloran, and Jeff Anderson have roles in this one - in fact, Affleck and Damon play themselves (Affleck has two roles). Other stars, like Carrie Fisher, Judd Nelson, Mark Hamill, and Will Ferrell, have small roles as well. It's a fast-paced road movie, as the duo run into myriad characters, including the gang from Scooby Doo and a band of female jewel thieves. Smith tosses everything in here he could think of, although there's probably more on the cutting room floor that didn't make it. As I said, there are plenty of inside jokes that reference previous Smith films and parody countless other Hollywood movies (Star Wars, The Fugitive).Having watched all of Kevin Smith's movies (and being from New Jersey, which doesn't hurt in this case), I hardly ever stopped laughing during this entire film!

Kevin Smith's ability to maintain these two layers at the same time is awesome. And he makes it look easy.The movie feels very much like one continous stream of thought.

Some one who has never tredged the askew universe will find this hilarious, and as a stand alone comedy it's definetly up there with some of the best.  Kevin smith fans however will look at this film completely differently, comapring it to his previous offerings and needlessly disecting a pretty good film.'Strike back' doesn't set out to give the brilliantly written, humorous and insightful dialogue of the past smith films, or provide the same intricate plots, but instead relies on what jay and silent bob do best -  fast running, non stop, low brow comedy.  And in that respect it can't be faulted, the movie is hilarious.  it contains plenty of straight out jokes, inside humour and silly slapstick to make anyone laugh continuously for the full hour and a half.The plot line is a little thin, and could definetly have been improved to give the movie some more substance, and i would have loved to have seen more of jeff anderson in this movie.  His role in clerks secures it as my favorite of the kevin smith films and i was disappointed he and brian o' halloran didn't get a bigger slice of the plot to reproduce their fantastic chemistry on the big screen.  That said, many of the familiar faces are back again with some great lines, full marks going to chris rock who made me laugh my head off.The only other glitch i can give the film is at times it does have a rather sell out feel to it, particularly with some of the sound track and the projection of jay and bob.  In past films jay loves himself and it was funny, because however much he believes it, he isn't.  But in this film jay gets respect from other sensible players and it takes away from the realism of his character, he's still doing the same 'i am gods gift to the earth' routine, but this time the film and the other characters actually treat him like he is.  Jay starts rapping -  music plays along.  jay trys to outsmart the police force - he gets away with it.  jay is his usual asshole self - a beautiful woman falls in love with him.  we lose all sense that he is god in his own little stoner world and he gets projected as if you really can be that moronic and get ahead in life.That said, although this is by no means the best smith film ever, it's a fantastic comedy and a nice touch to see something a little different. Kevin smith has managed to produce a saga spanning five films, three comics and even his own action figures all linked with little inside jokes and crossovers but still making everything totally different so your never digesting the same thing again.  if you've never heard of kevin smith then you'll love this movie to bits, if you are a smith fan then you should just switch off your expectations and watch it for what it is.  The film knows it isn't clerks or chasing amy (it even takes shots at itself throughout) so you shouldn't think of it in the same light.  A great film and a brilliant comedy, and to all the smith fans who badmouthed it, you KNOW your gonna buy it as soon as it comes out on video.

However while some slacker duo's get there own movies, (eg Bill and Ted, Wayne and Garth, Beavis and Butthead) Kevin Smith's creation never got treated with one. While you people will not have to wait for any longer, here is Jay and Silent Bob Strikes Back.The movie revolves around the two darkly dressed stoners/drug dealers who finds out that a movie is being made about them, and they want to stop the movie from being made. So from New Jersey, they hitchhike a lift to Hollywood. But on the way to L.A., their plans are interrupted by a bunch of bisexual, leather clad, foxy jewel thieves, an orangutan and some guy called Cock-Knocker. This is to name a few of the characthers. The movie is a great tribute to one of the great post modern comedy duos. It concides all of Kevin Smith movies, and takes the p*** of some movies, especially Miramax movies. Also the funniest part is when Ben Affleck and Matt Damon takes the p*** out of each other for their bad movie choices to be in.This movie is the funniest that i have seen all year, but it is a pity that not many people in Britain does not notice how funny Kevin Smith's movies are.

Sure, the moral majority may baulk at certain elements of the film (just like with Dogma), but who cares about them? This film is great.SPOILERS are here, by the way. The GWH2 scene is possibly the best, although the Star Wars parody is equally as funny.All the cameos are great, especially Ben Affleck and Jason Lee, reprising their previous Smith roles as Holden, and Bankie/Brodie respectively.It does come off as a kind of rip-off of Cheech & Chong's Next Movie (also highly recommended), but this is much better, and does actually have a cohesive storyline behind it, although it is forgotten at various points during the film, but that doesn't matter when you get to see Shannon Elizabeth and co in cat suits.I would say that to get the best out of this film, you would have to have seen the other Smith films, as it is heavily self-referential, and all the better for it.

When they don't get any of the profit from the film, they head to Hollywood to prevent the silly movie from getting made. Along the way they meet a variety of characters from dumb*ssses to ultra-cools.Let me say right off the bat this far funnier than your American Pie 2, Rat Race, and Rush Hour 2.  The reason I'm saying this is because this movie is filled with great guffaws. It include fart jokes, hollywood in-jokes, physical humor, hot babes, kool movie references and a great romance angle.Jason Mewes, Jay, steals the show with his obnoxious, arrogant personality. While Kevin Smith, Silent Bob, gives us more of his looks he expands on the acting with of few of his quirks.  Rest of the cast  performs solid.

Once again this movie is not merely a repeat or extension of another; it is distinctive in that it focusses on Jay and Silent Bob as no other movie has before, and thus, will appeal to a wider (and younger) audience.I have read on this board that GLAAD is protesting this film, and have searched the Internet (including GLAAD's website) for some confirmation, and have found none. Indeed, I support the work of GLAAD and would have been disappointed if they had labelled this movie as 'homophobic'.Yes, there are many references to homosexuality, homosexual acts, and so forth- and they are often for comic relief- but Kevin Smith does so not to attack gay people (after all, his films feature a relatively large proportion of gay characters, who have all been interesting and largely non-stereotypical); instead, he is poking fun at homophobes/heterosexists, and contemporary society's fixation on and stereotyping of sexual orientation.There were parts of the movie I did not like. I found the overuse of sexualizing the female characters redunant and boring (i.e. the two minute wannabe porno shots, which I am guessing, is also making fun of our society's treatment of women). And sometimes I too get tired of fart jokes.But all in all, this movie will please individuals who have enjoyed Kevin Smith's previous movies, and is well worth the $8 to go see it.

The parody is more obvious and include movies like 'Batman & Robin', 'Star Wars','E.T' and more. But the strength of the movie lie in its satiric side. The film mocks the way Hollywood make films, especially how Miramax makes movies(and praises go to the Weinstein brothers who agreed to produce this film). It mocks the way Hollywood choose the film it produce, its way of making sequels, the way the directors act on the set,casting decision(somewhere towards the end there is a remark about the fact that Miramax have Dame Judi Dench in any of their films,no matter what role it is and for how long. Sarcastic but true) and charcters changes due to casting decisions.Writer/director/star Kevin Smith has always strike me as someone who is strong with words and there is no exception here. He use the parody and the satire to convey some nice ideas. Like the power of the Internet, the fact that Hollywood has a problem to find good original ideas and therefore go to any source availible, even if it is of mediocre origin and more which the place here is too short to list them all. He add to that a directing that give the film the fast track it needs to become as hilarious as the film is.One last point is the accusation that the film is Homophobic. As a gay man I didn't feel that the film was Homophobic. Actually I think is been critic of the homophobia the exist in Hollywood and the fact that stars will do anything to hide their been gay, and some of them will turn Homophobic if it serve their purpose.In short, this is an hilarious film which should be seen by anyone and can be enjoyed in any level.

He has a knack for witty dialogue, which shows in his previous four films.  I wasn't a big fan of Dogma, but I loved Clerks, Mallrats and Chasing Amy.  Three out of four ain't bad at all.  Many criticize Kevin's films for being utterly tasteless, but I still disagree.  Though the characters in his movies use a good deal of profanity and the humor is pretty racy, the vulgarity's often handled in a mature, non-gratuitous manner.  The most tasteless gag I've seen in one of his movies was the s**t monster in Dogma.  We have now concluded the Jersey Trilogy (though this is the fifth installment) with this mindless filthfest which contradicts all of Kevin's ingenious work. All of the characters from the previous chapters of the Trilogy are brought together and satirized in the most lazy, disappointing way.  Jay and Silent Bob is simply a juvenile, profane, immature comedy that tries to disguise itself with Hollywood satire and a cast of multi-talented actors.  Why they actually approved of this dumber-than-dumb script?  I don't know.For all those people who believed the characters of Jay and Silent Bob wouldn't be able to carry a feature-length movie all on their own--this is where you're permitted to tell me I told you so.  Yes, I had faith in the two (previously) beloved characters.  The reason why they were beloved? Because we only had to see them for a total of 10-25 minutes.  The character of Silent Bob doesn't annoy me for obvious reasons, but I found out that Jay proves to be one of the MOST ANNOYING CHARACTERS IN MOVIE HISTORY!!!  He has Tom Green Syndrome.  He's hysterical all right...if taken in small doses. Was anybody laughing the millionth-or-so time he asked Shannon Elizabeth if she wanted to f**k?  It was funny in Dogma when he kept putting the moves on Linda Fiorentino, because the joke didn't run its course.  Here...it ran WAYYYY pass its course!  For 110 whole minutes Jay would not once shut the f**k up!!!!!!  In the scene where Silent Bob finally raises his voice and tells him off--I WAS LITERALLY APPLAUDING!!  I was ready for Silent Bob to stuff a sock down Jay's throat, so the film can be re-titled Bob and Silent Jay Strike Back.I've seen millions of R-rated movies in my lifetime.  I can watch Pulp Fiction over and over again without a flinch.  But everything in life has its boundaries.  As far as profanity goes, this film went way past the boundary, proclaiming it the filthiest movie of all time!  I've never heard more frequent, graphic uses of foul language in my life!  Not to mention an abundance of absolutely tasteless sex jokes with not a bit of structure. Watch the snowballing scene from Clerks and that'll prove to you that sexual humor can be handled with great structure.  Kevin decided to sacrifice his knack for dialogue, and simply riddle the whole film with four-letter words--LITERALLY!!  Oh no, my mistake.  C**ksucker has ten letters and p**sy has five letters.  Sorry I spoiled it for you guys.  I just gave away all the film's dialogue.  As for the satirical gags...Kevin totally misses the mark with such cheap shots.  We're reduced to watching Matt Damon and Ben Affleck insult each other's films.  The only one who actually made me laugh in this comedic lemon is SNL's Will Ferell, a highly-skilled comic actor who makes the most of whatever material's handed to him.  Aren't you the lucky one, Will?  Out of the cast of, like, a hundred big-time stars you're the one saving grace.I'll just give you a sample of the film's intellectual humor  In one scene this group of hot chicks--Shannon Elizabeth, Eliza Dushku and Ali Larter--get into skintight, Bond girl-type outfits and do backflips over a series of laser security lights.  Sounds great, so far.  Then, out of the blue, the beautiful Ali Larter rips a huge fart.  First of all  girls farting--not funny; disturbing, yes.  Second of all, the gag was totally uncalled for and simply an excuse to smother us with more fart jokes.  And here's another sample  After reading an angry letter, critizing the characters of Jay and Silent Bob, Jay replies with a letter telling them to eat their s**t, then s**t out their s**t and so on and so on.  The point is the s words is used over and over and over again in the most sickening, tasteless manner.  That definitely wins the award for Most Tasteless Monologue in Movie History.I've seen tons of profane movies in my life, but this is one I actually find horribly offensive.  A comedy like this makes Dude Where's My Car look like Shakespeare.  I understand that there are films out there that aren't meant to be deep and sophisticated, but even shallow films need a good dose of wit and originality to make them worth watching.  In the Bill and Ted movies, the characters may have been stupid, but the writing wasn't.  This is an example of filth for the sake of filth.  Stupidity for the sake of stupidity.  There's only one element missing  THE LAUGHS!  Unless you find ANYTHING having to do with sex or bodily functions funny and have a mind that's stuck in the gutter, this is no more than a complete yuckfest.  Go see American Pie 2!  That's an example of crude and sexual humor handled very nicely, perfectly timed and perfectly delivered.  The way it's supposed to be.  The way John Landis did it back when we were introduced to our first gross-out comedy classic, Animal House.  As I said, as these gross-out comedies increase in popularity, writers/directors have lost their sense of structure and pretty much feel if it's dirty, it's funny.  But I never thought Kevin Smith would sink that low.  Shame on you!This is a first.  The movie I most anticipated this summer turned out to be the worst movie I've seen this summer.  I've gotten disappointed by movies before, but never this much.  After seeing Kevin's first three films and getting introduced to this disastrous finale, who wouldn't?  Don't start using the excuse this movie is strictly for Kevin Smith fans.  True, if you've never seen a Kevin Smith movie before, you won't get the in-jokes. And if you have, you will get the in-jokes; you just won't laugh at them. This is not intended for fans only; this is intended for the most immature audience out there.

Kevin Smith breaks the oldest Hollywood rule (no looking at the camera!) about a half-dozen times during this film, because he knows who YOU are! And we, the audience, know who HE is, and we love his work. If you don't know who the heck Kevin Smith is, why are you even reading this? Well, if you really want to know, rent Clerks and Mallrats and proceed from there.Now, let me talk to those of you who are familiar with the ViewAskew Universe. Go and see this flick, okay? Sure, it's not as slacker/intellectual as Clerks, or as focused on tortured relationships as Chasing Amy. But it has the spark of Mallrats - the movie most  people hated because it was so juvenile. That was exactly why I loved it. It was a return to those cheesy 80's movies that were pure entertainment. Hey, I loved Memento and Pi, but I also loved Dazed & Confused and Big Trouble in Little China! Jay & Silent Bob is in the latter category; it's just for fun! Don't take it too seriously, just sit back and enjoy the ride.As for the gay & lesbian, etc. people who are ripping on this movie Come on. This is the guy who gave you (and all of us) Chasing Amy. Chill. Besides, it's obvious that Jay has some latent homosexual issues to deal with, as was touched on in Dogma with Chris Rock's insights into Jay's mastabatory habits. Now, onto the fun stuff! It's a Cameo-fest! All those old characters are back, like Dante, Randall (my personal fave) and Brodie. It was like seeing old friends again (don't I sound like a loser?), if only briefly. But that's what this movie is about; friends and fun. Also, as I said earlier, this movie is all about establishing a connection between the audience and the fans (and the detractors!). Jay & Silent Bob read some losers'  disparaging comments about them, and decide to put the smack down. At the end of the movie, it's implied that if you write a bad review (on this site, no doubt) about this  movie, Jay & Silent Bob will come to your house and beat you up! How cool is that?! ) In fact, there's a good chance, Kevin and Jason will read this review, which is so weird! The internet has truly brought us all together - and allowed us to say things we wouldn't say to peoples' faces. This movie is a pioneer in the changing dynamics of the audience/filmmaker relationship - and it's basically cutting out the professional movie critic (woohoo!). I could write a dissertation on how this will alter the movie-going/making landscape forever, but screw that. Just go see the movie and when you're not laughing at Jay's foulmouthed antics, think about how the internet is changing our lives in every conceivable way. The movie itself can be uneven. In fact, some parts drag on and seem a little unnecessary, like the monkey. I mean, I understand what you were thinking, Kevin; monkeys are pure cinematic gold, like midgets ) but the monkey wasn't that charming. Regardless, 2001 will be remembered as the year of the monkey. At other times, the rough-cut vibe of this flick really works. Like when Jay is fantasizing about kissing Justice (Shannon Elizabeth) the first time he sees her. Jay is totally licking her face and for a brief second you can see Shannon roll her eyes! Funny stuff! I imagine that Jason Mewes talked Kevin into scoring a hot babe for the roll of Justice. I wonder if Jason got to make the final pick. If so, he chose wisely! Chris Rock crackered me up once again as Shaka Luther King. The way he tortured that poor white boy who kept trying to give him coffee was hilarious. And Kevin paid even more homage to Star Wars by featuring cameos by both Carrie Fisher (as a nun) and Mark Hamill, as The CockKnocker, who is apparently a villain in the BluntMan & Chronic comic series.Anyway, the cameos really helped make this movie cool. George Carlin's was good, and Tracy Morgan's was excellent! It was also good to see Matt Damon and Ben Affleck making fun of themselves and each other. I could go on and on. The point being, this movie is star-studded, full of hilarity and stupidity (Jay and Silent Bob are really portrayed as idiots, probably for plot reasons - ganja doesn't make you stupid, just relaxed). Oh, and the Scooby Doo parody was extremely psychotic!Anyway, if you ever read this, drop me a line and tell me what you thought of the movie and my review. Might as well keep the information flowing back & forth. Like in the movie, I believe in breaking down the walls between the audience and the filmmaker. Viva la Revolution!

The plot bears striking resemblance to the hilarious Beavis & Butt-Head Do America, but this doesn't take away from the film as a whole or make it seem redundant or even unoriginal because the plot is actually a very small part of the film. It is no secret that Jay and Silent Bob are the reason that we keep getting treated to more films from Kevin Smith (you think he would have gotten any corporate sponsors after that mess Chasing Amy if it weren't for them?), so it's nice that they finally decided to dedicate an entire film to them.The movie as a whole is composed of a series of dirty jokes and a goofball plot that is squashed into obscurity under the hilarious presence of Jay and his famous silent sidekick. Sadly, this is virtually the only thing that the film has going for it. On the nother hand, it's unfortunately ironic that the very thing that made this movie interesting is also the most disappointing part of it - the casting. Obviously, Jay and Silent Bob could never be played by anyone else, but the casting director seems to have gone a little bit overboard with more than a couple of the cameos. I loved seeing James Van der Beek and that idiot Jason Biggs, I thought they both played great roles in this movie (probably because they were making fun of themselves during most of their screen time). These are some of the most recognizable of the recent proliferation of actors who can't act and who have made it into Hollywood by some mysterious manipulation of reality. Van der Beek I can't explain, but I imagine Biggs was found because he was hired to play a part in what could not have been thought to be more than a goofy b-movie comedy, American Pie, and it turned out to be a huge hit, so the producers erroneously thought that he was suddenly a huge star. Whoops.Then you have a great cameo from Matt Damon and Ben Affleck. Yeah, these guys proved themselves with Good Will Hunting, which was so good that Affleck can even be forgiven for the ridiculous Armageddon. The best part of Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back, the way that it pokes fun at Hollywood, comes especially into play into this cameo, as we are treated to a scene from the sequel to Good Will Hunting (`Applesauce!'). Carrie Fisher plays an unenviable role as the nun who picks Jay and Silent Bob when an unfortunate turn of events leaves them stuck as hitchhikers. Seann William Scott, the real comedic source that made movies like American Pie and Road Trip at least slightly amusing, is completely wasted in a role that makes no sense to have him in. He plays a hopeless geek who happens to be traveling with a bunch of hotties (as Roger Ebert would say, no prizes for guessing why he took the role), and there is no reason for him to be in this role other than to put him in the preview and make people think that he will actually do something funny in it, and we are totally disappointed. He is literally thrown out of a moving van and out of the movie before anything even happens.However, it is poor Mark Hamill who is really to be felt sorry for after watching this movie. It is clear from the minute you hear the title that there is going to be some serious Star Wars bashing going on here, but the best spoofs are the ones that make fun of films themselves, not the deflated state of the old stars (if you want to see a brilliant Star Wars spoof, watch Spaceballs). Poor Mark Hamill was one of the main stars of the most successful science fiction series of all time, and a couple decades later he's stuck playing a character called `Cock-knocker' in a goofball comedy with virtually no redeeming values. They even had to put up a huge title card to make sure that people notice that the poor guy underneath all that ridiculous make-up is the fallen sci fi hero. Kevin Smith has NOT earned enough respect to justify smacking Star Wars like that.Jay and Silent Bob is not a movie that is going to be remembered as a great comedy. It's a huge success because the characters have become so famous with junior high school and high school kids all over the world, but there is no content in the film. It fits snugly among movies like the Scary Movies and American Pie and Road Trip and Dude, Where's My Car? With some effort, some amusement and possibly an occasional nervous laugh can be derived from these slopfests (okay, not the Scary Movies, but the rest had their moments), so luckily Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back is one of the better films in this ludicrous category (thanks in no small part to the wonderful contribution from Ben Affleck and Matt Damon), but the film is likely to be reduced to bottom shelf oblivion faster than you can say, `For God's sake, Kevin, no more!'

The jokes are on a par with those in, say, Not Another Teen Movie, but way above those of, say, Scary Movie 2.) The real winning aspect of this film were the faultless performances by the second tier cast. In particular, Eliza Dushku shines as Sissy, the no-nonsense leader of a team of female jewel thieves - in many ways a role similar to a cruder version of her Buffy the Vampire Slayer persona, Faith. Will Ferrell is almost as good as Wildlife Ranger Willenholly, brilliantly pulling off his ineptitude, and delivering the film's best line 'Fuckbeans! That was them, wasn't it?' Chris Rock is the typically reverse-racist African American director of 'Bluntman and Chronic,' and gleefully makes a scene. Shannon Elizabeth is finally given a good role (as opposed to American Pie's eastern European bombshell, Nadia) and shows that she doesn't have to be type-casted into personality-free roles. 'As himself' cameos from Jason Biggs, James van der Beek, Ben Affleck and Matt Damon also go down a treat, and in the end it's only Seann William Scott whose secondary character annoys.

Remember that name from 'The Fugitive'?), the 'experiment' detailed under Suzannes name tag on her cage, the posturing of Mooby the Cow which mirrors Buddy Christ from Dogma, and countless more.Speaking of Dogma The cross references to all the other View Askew movies are so ubiquitous that you hardly can catch them all, right down to the poses and props of the 'clerks' which are 100% in sync with those of the movie of the same name. Every name and every reference is there for a purpose. Try to spot any movie name or similar said as an aside, and you will notice that they are all references to things said in earlier movies of the 'Jersey Trilogy' So why do I like this move? I'm not a fan of fart or gay jokes. Neither am I a fan of 'stupid buddy' movies like 'Dumb and dumber' or 'Bill and Ted' or 'Dude, where's my car?'. But this movie is unique. It's for the fan. For the person who looks for the detail. For the person who gets sick at 'Greedo shooting first' and all the other small things that make movies either a hit or a flop. It's for he fan who enjoys the recollection of fun moments by a gesture, a quote or an outright homage to another movie. It's for the fan who likes to have his brain activated while watching - this is why this movie is surprisingly mentally stimulating even though its content is mostly inane.Ultimately it's not the story, nor the cast that make a movie a hit - it's the depth of the picture. It's how much you get the feeling that this is not just 'make believe' to get you to shell out a few bucks, but the feeling that here are people having fun by doing what they want to do - and letting you in on it. This is why Star Wars worked, and this is why this movie works. There is depth here (No, I am not comparing the quality of Star Wars to this movie - don't even think that for a second). But in Star Wars it was the feeling that the characters have lived in this universe for a long time, and here it's similar. Through the other movies we get the feeling that here is a background community. A history from which the action unfolds. We as fans are privy to that history - and the fact that this history isn't spelled out to any schmuck who wanders into this movie makes it all the more sweet.Of course the cast must meet minimum standards, and I am surprised at how excellent Jason Mewes plays his part (from life). At no point do you get the feeling that he is being played to the wall by the big names around him. All 'round they do a pretty good job of it (as most of them have done in the other Kevin Smith movies).The story? Not important. It's just a vehicle for shuffling our heroes from one goofy situation to the next - and it does this exceedingly well. There's no lengths, no parts you want to skip upon rewatching, and that is very rare these days. Everywhere you have Smith's trademark long, convoluted and vocabulary laden monologues and dialogs going on, which I have fallen in love with since his treatise on 'subcontractors on the Death Star' in 'Clerks'.I recommended this to a friend who hadn't seen any of the other movies in the series, and he loved it.

I will give credit to the Good Will Hunting 2 scene, that is hysterical, and it's fun seeing so many big name actors (Matt Damon, Ben Affleck) and actresses (Shannon Elizabeth, Elize Dushku) make appearances but even this ensemble of characters couldn't save this dud. It seemed like Kevin Smith had an ambitious vision for this project, trying to sum up the stories of Jay and Silent Bob, while also attempting to do a spoof on Hollywood. Noble ideas, wretched execution. Honestly, watching the Star Wars scene was one of the most painful experiences in my life, I couldn't believe how bad it was. Not to mention the non-stop bathroom humor. Look, I found the vile language to be hilarious in the first Kevin Smith movies, but man, how about a little bit of balance? How many jokes about the male anatomy can one make? Overall, I was horribly let down by this movie and after seeing how unsuccessful Jersey Girl was, I hope Kevin Smith isn't slipping into oblivion. His first couple of movies were awesome, but this was a sad way to end the saga of Jay and Silent Bob.

That wouldn't be so bad, if only the movie were funny. Or interesting.  Or entertaining.  Unfortunately, it's none of the above. This isn't even a movie, it's a bunch of half-baked ideas thrown together, geared directly at rabid Kevin Smith fans, and no one else.  Again, that would be okay if the movie was the least bit enjoyable.  But it just plain isn't.What is it?  Well, let me go down the list.  I found this movie to be stupid, patronizing, obnoxious, boring, obvious, self-satisfied, arrogant, unimaginative, trite, insulting, and, above all else, spectacularly unfunny.Smith's satirical jokes about Hollywood, the internet and pop culture are made with all the subtlety of a thermonuclear explosion. In one scene, Jay and Bob hitch a ride in the Mystery Machine with the Scooby Doo gang.  I groaned.  Apparently, I, being a Gen-Xer, am supposed to go, Ha ha! Scooby Doo!  I get it!  Then, the whole gang get high and Daphne and Velma take their tops off.  I groaned again.  Yeah.  Shaggy's a pot head, Daphne's hot, Velma's a lesbian.  I've heard it.  It was funny once.  Now, for the zillionth time, it's kind of lost it's humor.Other jokes drop dreadfully dead.  Jay has a light saber battle with Mark Hammill in one scene.  Okay, cameo by a pop culture icon, fine.  Then Jay slices off Hammill's hand, at which Hammill wails, Oh no, not again! Give me a break!  Mel Brooks developed a bad habit in his later movies of feeling he needed to point out the punchlines to his jokes.  Smith has the same problem here, only his jokes aren't funny.  The movie is full of these wink-wink cameos, most of which are uninspired and pointless.  Only George Carlin, as a hitch hiker with a unique style of getting rides, and Seann William Scott, as a sensitive milquetoast, provide any real laughs. The gifted Will Ferrell tries hard, but cannot overcome the leaden weight of Smith's lifeless dialogue.And, though they are listed prominently in the movie's advertising, Ben Affleck, Jason Lee and Chris Rock have little more than cameo appearances themselves.But the biggest problem with JAY AND SILENT BOB STRIKE BACK are Jay and Silent Bob.  The characters are okay in short spurts, as in Smith's previous films, but they simply cannot carry an entire movie.  As Jay, Jason Mewes grows more and more irritating, until the sight of him made me want to kick in the TV.  I have no problem with profanity or crudity, but enough is enough!  Hearing him say the F word or talk about farting and wanting to get laid over and over and over again becomes worse than figernails on a chalkboard after a while.  Not because it's offensive, but because it's tiresome and sophomoric in the extreme.  And Smith's Silent Bob is equally irritating, in that the bugging out the eyes/pantomiming instead of talking joke has seriously worn off, and by the time he gives his obligatory speech at the movie's finale, I've ceased to care.This is Smith's only major misfire to date.  I enjoyed CLERKS and CHASING AMY.  MALLRATS was flawed, but it held my attention.  I thought DOGMA was close to brilliant.  I was expecting J&SBSB to at least be amusing.  I was gravely disappointed.  The only people who appear to be having a good time are the actors.  I just sat there, dumbfounded, marveling at the fact that Smith got such a mind-numbingly moronic movie produced and released by a major studio.More power to him--unfortunately for us.

I will buy the next movie that he bases on Jay & Silent Bob (if he does so ?), as i think they are great films really funny as well ).I dont know if anyone knows or has spotted this but(they probably have spotted it though), when Matt Damon is lying on the road dead in Dogma we see his foot move in one shot ? a mistake ? who knows.This movie has many MANY witty one liners, some are funny and some are really funny like for instance ``Super Monkey F**k`` as spoken by Jay, you`ll know what i mean if you`ve seen the movie.then there`s Shannon Elizabeth & Eliza Dushku both are extremely beautiful women pure eye candy, especially in the leather outfits  they wear later in the movie ).Will Ferrall (correct spelling for surname ?), he was funny as a kind of Animal Detective of sorts, you first see him arrive on a Harley ) and crash into a van and leave the bike where it crashes.Seann William Scott makes an appearance (as do quite a few Celeb`s in the movie), and it is funny how his character makes a departure thanx to Jay and what Jay shouts at him as he goes.The Jay & Silent Bob movies are as follows in terms of being funny *my opinion only folks*Jay & Silent Bob Strike Back #1. Mallrats & Dogma, both #2.these are the only Kevin Smith movies i like so far and hopefully will add the next J&SB movie if he`s so kind enough to make one ?, come on Mr Smith you know you want to as do most of us want you to as well ).There was a really funny moment where Scooby Doo was worked into the movie, Daphney looked really nice and the funny part was where Fred threatened to feed Shaggy to Scooby ), and the mention of Dooby Snacks as well which warrents a medal for funniness.If your looking for a movie with quite a few laff`s in it then watch this but beware it has strong language thanx to Jay running his mouth off all the time (but that is all part of the comedy )).rating for this movie - 10/10, rating for the comedy in it 10/10, rating for Shannon Elizabeth 12/10, rating for Eliza Dushku 12/10, rating for Ali Larter 10/10, rating for that other chick with Shannon & Eliza & Ali, 9 and a half/10.

Basically the star slackers, dope-smoking, jive-talking Jay (Jason Mewes) and Silent Bob (Smith himself, only uttering a few words somewhere in the middle) have discovered their book alter egos Bluntman and Chronic are having a movie made about them by Miramax, but they are getting bad hate mail (about the characters, and their real names), and they are now heading from Jersey to Hollywood to stop the movie being made. On the way, Jay meets the love of his life with Justice (American Pie's Shannon Elizabeth), who along with Missy (Jennifer Schwalbach Smith, Kevin's wife), Sissy (True Lies' Eliza Dushku) and Chrissy (Final Destination and Heroes' Ali Larter) plan to steal a bunch of diamonds. The cops are on their tails, including Federal Wildlife Marshal Willenholly (Will Ferrell), who is only brought in when a primate/monkey (whatever) is stolen, and The Clit, lol. One of the reasons this film is fun to watch, besides the in-jokes, small spoofs and bad language (yes, the swearing is very funny) is because of the numerous cameo appearances of well-known actors who aren't afraid to send themselves up. These include Ben Affleck, My Name Is Earl's Jason Lee, The Breakfast Club's Judd Nelson, George Carlin, Star Wars' Carrie Fisher, American Pie's Seann William Scott, Tracy Morgan, Good Will Hunting director Gus Van Sant, Chris Rock, Jamie Kennedy, Scream director Wes Craven, Shannen Doherty, Mark Hamill, American Pie's Jason Biggs, Matt Damon and Dawson's Creek star James Van Der Beek. It also featuring the number one single from Afroman, Because I Got High, Jay and Silent Bob naturally feature in the music video. Good!
