[{"Title":"Whoever said this was the worst Star Trek film is so wrong!","Date":"30 September 2006","Score":"67 out of 99 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi","Review":" In my personal opinion, and as an avid Next Generation fan, without a doubt Insurrection is one of the best Star Trek films, and the third outing for Picard, Riker, Deanna and the rest of the Next Generation crew stays most true to their esteemed television series. This time round, the crew are faced with a violation of the Prime Directive and whether or not the 600 people who live on a literal planet-of-youth are more important than the millions of other people that could benefit from the planet's regenerative powers. Action, drama, comedy and romance follow in true Star Trek spectacular.As always Patrick Stewart is in top form as Captain Picard who leads the Star Trek resistance to save the innocents from one of his own corrupt superiors Vice Admiral Dougherty (played terrifically by Anthony Zerbe) who are involved with some aliens (including F. Murray Abraham's Ad'har). Along the way Picard finds a new friend in Anij (played by the lovely Donna Murphy), one of the Ba'ku, and a little romance follows.Jonathan Frakes once again directs and does an outstanding job, though it does mean his character Commander Riker gets a bit less screen time, though he is always a pleasure to watch. Riker's relationship with Commander / Counsellor Deanna Troi heats up in this film (and it's about time too!) Marina Sirtis of course returns as the lovely Troi and gets a fairly good amount of screen time this time round, and certainly most of the comical moments. Frakes and Sirtis have great chemistry together.Brent Spinter's Data gets (as usual) too much screen time, again his story consists of his quest to become more human and the like, though he does befriend a Ba'ku child which was done quite well. As usual Gates McFadden (Dr. Beverly Crusher), Michael Dorn (Lt. Commander Worf) and LeVar Burton (Lt. Commander LaForge) are given very little to do in the Star Trek films, and this one is no exception, though at least Worf and LaForge got their own small story lines - Worf had to go through puberty again and LaForge found himself with the ability to see. Beverly however only gets a storyline involving her boobs firming up. Terrific. Poor Gates must be the most under-appreciated actress in all of Star Trek, but also the most gracious for returning each time.The special effects of Star Trek Insurrection are above average, and the music score is really well done. Often its the small moments in the Next Generation films that are the best, and this one is no different, but at least the big moments are good too. I think the Star Trek the Next Generation films are probably the only action-type films in which the heroes are all (with the exception of Marina Sirtis) in their 50's and people still want to watch them. Quite interesting too that a main theme of the movie was the eternal youth. At least when the sad time comes that the Next Generation cast are no longer alive, they will be immortalised in history by their much loved characters and beautiful stories, just like Insurrection.

How useless we are; we contribute nothing to our society. Here is my contribution; the film bombed for one reason. Even non philosophers have a God given sense of right and wrong that tells them whether something is intrinsically wrong. No, Anij if you possess something that would help billions of people who are suffering you are not entitled to your own little narcissistic paradise, sorry. The total moral revulsion at self love, this deep, with Picard babbling about how, because these reasonings can be difficult, it somehow follows that we are not entitled to make them. NON SEQUITUR Sorry, chrome dome, doctors, nurses, firemen and policemen make these decisions every day. We know you are too cowardly to allow reality within your little, narcissistic dreamland, where you hide, like the cowards you are, from the harsh truths of life. They were not even indigenous to that planet, not that it would have made any difference.Frakes had hit a home run with First Contact, why I never know, this took care of his career as a director. The thing about psychotic narcissism it really does not notice that any other living beings or their boundless suffering exists. No, just so Anij can live within the beats of her heart; she simply never hears the screams of the suffering around her. What little children they are happy in their safe little playhouse. Pity the two great actors working in this pile of crap Zerbe and Abraham. Poor F. Murray, it is a long way from Salieri!!The film features cringe worthy moments even for Star Trek and that is saying something. The Gilbert and Sullivan sing a long made me see if there were any sharp edges on the seat I could slash my wrists with. TNG crew here is a news flash for you; you cannot act and your movies suck as bad as your overrated TV show. Their humanism is always so taxing; the philosophy requires a historical lobotomy all the horrors present and past humans have and are perpetrating must be expunged. Fear, fear of the truth always haunts them as they run into Disneyland never to return to reality again. Imagine, you could relieve the suffering of trillions but this handful of self loving pigs are entitled. Gee, do you think that might reflect people in 1997? Actually, no the film was a huge bomb; I applaud the common American people, who while not philosophers, know disgusting selfishness when they hear and see it. Q.E.D.

What a movie!","Date":"7 January 1999","Score":"62 out of 103 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi","Review":"  I would say that this movie rivals the skill of the first Next Generation movie, First Contact. If anything, the dialogue is more refined and the humour, of which there is a great deal, is well timed and raised smiles at suitable points in the movie. Many have criticised the writers for either making the humour too silly or, for not daring to take the jokes to the belly-laugh level. Personally, I think the film is richer for the homour, which seems natural, not forced, and generally hit its targets. After all though, it's not a comedy.Insurrection is a movie which displays far more humanity than the cold, but nevertheless enthralling, First Contact. To compare the movies is difficult, as they are very different, and opinions will inevitably clash. Both movies have a different agenda, I think.I would dare to say that Insurrection would do a better job at converting people to the Star Trek cause than would any of the other films. Before watching, I knew little about Star Trek, and it really stoked my interest in the series. In evaluating Insurrection I realised that the film has several outstanding set-pieces, some of which are very memorable, such as the high-speed chase between Picard and Data through the cloud layers, with The Captain trying to coax Data into performing a scene from Gilbert and Sullivan's HMS Pinafore. The scene is outrageous, and very surreal, and extremely well done. Another example would be the attack of the flying miniature transporter robots, where Worf really gets to prove how brave, and violent, he really is.Finally, the acting is universally good, and Stewart puts in a performance of depth, although not as impressive as in First Contact. The plot of Insurrection is slight, and alone doesn't manage to hold the attention. But the other elements that go into producing a good movie, such as the script, acting, directing, and, dare I say it, special effects, add up to an entertaining whole.I think that free of the limitations imposed by the classic trek rules, and the campy acting that dogged the earlier Trek flicks, the Star Trek franchise will flourish, and this movie shows how much a cast enjoying what they are doing adds to the fun and feel-good factor of watching the film with a cinema full of enthralled viewers. Well done Jonathan Frakes!

Honestly, I don't know why many people don't like it when production wise, it couldn't have been any better. Each scene is nicely constructed and utilizes all the necessary ingredients of film making.OK, the story was simple but for what the story was, screen writer Michael Piller, wrote a screenplay that is so polished, that every one-liner was perfectly timed and the dialogue was very sharp. The drama and story unfolded not too slowly and not too fast. The characterization was fantastic particularly the conflict between Piracy and Admiral Ross. It's a story about fighting for what you believe in, which every character in the film, even the bad guys, does until the bitter end.There is no rules that says a science fiction film or Star Trek must have a complex storyline, but a storyline that tells a story and tells it well is what Insurrection does perfectlyI don't enjoy action films and I think 'Star Trek First Contact' is one of the most overrated sci-fi actioneers in years. Insurrection had a very human story and is also very audience friendly for those who have never seen Star Trek.I think people need to take another look at this film and ask what is wrong with it apart from the story being too simple? Production design looks great, the film is beautifully shot, Jerry Goldsmith's score was perfect, and the energy from performances from the entire cast comes off in the film like no other Star Trek movie.'Star Trek Insurrection' is a very underrated film, and a film that deserves way more credit.SCORE 9 out of 10  "},{"Title":"The worst TNG movie ever!!!","Date":"17 January 2007","Score":"16 out of 23 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi","Review":" So let's get this straight The Federation has partnered with an alien race to harness the power of a planet's rings, adding years of lifespan to literally trillions of beings throughout the galaxy...the only thing they need do is re-locate 600 squatters (who have no more legal right to the planet as anyone else).This seems like a good deal, right? Isn't this what Spock taught? The needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few? Apparently not, because Picard mounts an insurrection to stop the deal, after calculating that a forced relocation was more of a moral outrage than the squatter's hording of life-extending powers, denying trillions of federation members additional years of life.So what does he do? He leads the squatters (a bunch of pacifist hippie beatniks who've rejected technology to embrace blissed ignorance) into a series of collapsing mountain caves to thwart efforts by the bad guys to beam the squatters to safety. Picard figures that the bad guys won't tap this fountain of youth until the squatters are off the surface (which will be scorched during the process).I don't know what's worse...(a) the fact that Picard is naive enough to use the squatters as human shields in hopes that the bad guys aren't really bad enough to kill them, or (b) the fact that we have bad guys who aren't really bad enough to kill the squatters. Either way, this is easily the worst Star Trek plot ever conceived.I haven't even discussed the nonsense with the chick that can inexplicably slow down time when she feels like it, or the plot demands.

However, Paramount are in really bad shape if no-one there has the power to say STOP even when presented with this load of rubbish.By far the biggest irritant is that the alleged good guys are actually some of the most hateful people ever filmed. While these people, known as Baku, have been leading drippy and unproductive lives for centuries their own children have been banished to grow old and infirm on another planet. When these now technologically advanced Sona return, close to death, in an attempt to benefit from their home planet's natural regenerative radiation, the Baku hoodwink Picard and his crew into thinking that they are infact the victims. This is mainly because the Baku, basking in regenerative radiation all day long, have remained relatively pretty while the Sona are now very ugly as the film takes pains to point out. It's been thankfully a long time since I have seen a totally white cast in a film, but black people are conspicuous by there absence from the Baku. Additionally Picard takes up with a Baku who has spent her last 300 odd years learning how to look like a pouting airhead even when tons of rubble are falling on her head, yet cannot row a boat or swim when she needs to. This even though she lived next to a lake all that time!Goodness knows what sort of point Jonathan Frakes is trying to make with this film.I would recommend that anyone considering watching this film does so on DVD/video with the remote control never far away from their grasp.

It still has the action and adventure of a Star Trek movie, but it's at a much slower pace and it has the morality that I love about Star Trek.What I found truly interesting about this movie is the fact that there is more character development then in most Star Trek films--Captain Picard falls in love and Data furthers his understanding of what it means to be human through a friendship with a young boy on the Baku planet.All in all, what's not to like?

Sure, there are all the typical elements that there should be in a Star Trek movie, the sense of wonder and exploration and the big space battles. But none of the common enemies like the Borg, Dominion or others appear. Instead the crew of Enterprise is thrown into a secret research mission aiming to steal an entire planet from a small population because of the miraculous healing properties it has.The tempo is a little different, actually more harmonic than many others. And the story is just as good as any other Star Trek movie. Not surprisingly, the cast is as good as always. That is one of the best part of the Star Trek movies, they have managed to keep the crew of the different Enterprises together and you feel like you get to know them. And you know them even before the movie has started.For the Star Trek fans this is a must see, even though it is a little different from the others.

I even felt a little ripped off, because the whole affair felt to me like a pretty standard Star Trek episode stretched like the skin of the alien villains in the film well past the point of integrity. I also felt disappointed that Berman and the other Paramount decision makers had further abandoned any attempt at character development or continuity between films in the series.There just seems to be a lack of ambition and imagination surrounding the entire project. Although I definitely enjoyed it much more this time around &#150; maybe it's just that an extended STTNG episode is more appealing now in 2007 than it was in 1998&#133; the show has been off the air for a few years now and is barely syndicated at this point. But I also noticed some positive qualities &#150; Geordi LaForge was always my favorite supporting character in the show and he gets his best scene in the series here watching a sunset with Picard after gaining his vision. F. Murray Abraham is as good as the script will let him be and the makeup effect is pretty striking (I love how he starts bleeding from pores in his face when he gets angry). There are some excellent set pieces like the bit with Picard and Worf chasing down a renegade Data and singing Gilbert and Sullivan to pacify him. The first time I saw it I was confused by the characters departing so much from their established personalities, but this time I realized it was due to the sci-fi element, the effects of the planet's healing properties on the crew. From that perspective it's very nice to see characters reverting back to earlier behavior and I like seeing the clean-shaven Riker again though I never bought his relationship to Troi.But the essential reality hasn't changed. The sets and locations look and feel exactly like a dozen episodes of the Next Generation show, and the costumes for the aliens are downright mundane. It's impossible not to be reminded of little Wesley Crusher (thank the gods of ST that he and Alexander did not make film appearances) getting in trouble for throwing a ball in the bushes, when you see these perfect and mellow people in their paradise. The direction by Frakes is standard TV direction just like in First Contact. Too much of the story revolves around the 2 central plot twists, and you can almost feel the commercial break coming on. Abraham's villain is fun to look at and the concept is good, but he never really confronts Picard or the Enterprise in such a way that the conflict feels personal. Donna Murphy is a fine actress and it's great to see Picard hook up, but their love affair is too gentle to be believable, totally lacking in drama, and then it's dispensed with at the conclusion far too easily&#133;. Again, just like a TV episode in which the consequences of the episode cannot intrude into the flow of the series.One thing I did like, however, was the central concept &#150; the search for immortality is universal and compelling, and tying it into the history of forced relocations adds the kind of real-world resonance that First Contact and the first 3 films in the original series were lacking. The fact that members of the Federation are in a conspiracy and that their motives remain ambiguous even after the conspiracy is uncovered is also very much in the spirit of the best qualities of the Next Generation show with its increased emphasis on political intrigue, another element missing from previous Star Trek films (with the notable exception of The Undiscovered Country. Another interesting story element of note &#150; on the commentary for 1st Contact regular series writers Brannon Braga and Ronald Moore discuss an original draft in which Picard remains on the planet and is involved in a love affair while Riker fights the aliens in space as a B plot (btw, it's telling how even now the screenwriters discuss plot mechanics exactly like a TV episode). Here we have a different credited writer, but the resulting plot is very similar to what was originally conceived for First Contact but changed apparently on Patrick Stewart's request.In the final analysis, I feel the film is actually more pleasing to me as a fan because it's more true to the tradition of Star Trek than First Contact. At least this one actually utilizes science-fiction ideas, as opposed to simply doing an action movie in space. But the film isn't as ambitious as it should be, and I feel the central problem is that the alien culture was made too simple and earth-bound, the melodrama between Picard and his love interest was non-existent, and overall there's just not enough meat on this story's bones. But what we do get is pretty well done and pleases me as a fan of the show.

Jean-Luc, answers his superior, Admiral Dougherty, We're only moving six-hundred people. How many people does it take, Admiral, before it becomes wrong, asks Picard in return, A thousand. Fifty Thousand. A million? The above exchange occurs during Insurrection's key scene. The entire first half of the film meticulously builds to this conversation between Starfleet officers. Dougherty (Anthony Derbe) justified his actions because the needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few. Picard (Patrick Stewart) sights the Prime Directive, which prohibits interference with other cultures or their natural development. The two officers had remained on a collision course until the moment when something had to give.The conflict begins during a routine survey. Insurrection opens with a gorgeous panorama of an agrarian village. Children frolic about in the tall grass outside the perimeter. Farmers lift gates to aqueducts, women laugh pleasantly as they slam down their bread dough for kneading and the blacksmith works away. We are treated to long panoramic looks at the restful town and its benign inhabitants, the Ba'ku. Members of a culture survey walk about unnoticed in their isolation suits, invisible to the eye. Director Jonathan Frakes' willingness to take so much time introducing the audience to the setting demonstrates an unusual amount of focus for a movie like this.The peace is shattered when Data (Brent Spiner) begins acting wildly. He exposes the survey and follows with many more bizarre and aggressive actions. The architects of survey, Admiral Dougherty and the So'na leader Ad'har Ru'afo (F. Murray Abraham) orbit above the planet. Data's behavior puzzles and scares them, and they ask Picard how to destroy him.Delaying his orders, Picard (Patrick Stewart) arrives and successfully captures Data. Against the wishes of Dougherty, Picard stays to determine why his android became a loose cannon. Picard acquaints himself with Anij (Donna Murphy), a Ba'ku woman who informs him that Data told the Ba'ku that the survey team was their enemy. A short investigation uncovers a conspiracy to forcibly remove the Ba'ku from their planet.The planet, buried deep in a gaseous cloud called the Briar Patch, has rings that act as a fountain of youth to its inhabitants. Dougherty and Ru'afo believe that the planet must be used for medical reasons, and Picard is forced to make the choice to abandon the Ba'ku or violate his orders.It is at this point when the film accelerates. The conflict becomes a proverbial chess match between grand masters as the Enterprise crew tries to keep the planet inhabited. Both sides devise as many solutions as they can think of to accomplish their missions. The audience is almost invited to participate as the movie keeps them wondering what the next move will be.The script shines with an abnormal level of polish. It deftly handles the question of whether an officer should obey orders or stand up for what is right. Almost every line flawlessly captures the writers' intent and communicates them to the viewers with beautiful yet easily understood diction. Every character sounds expressive and well educated. The dialogue is free-flowing and enjoyable. There is even a scene where Picard calms Data with a rousing rendition of A British Tar. I imagine the production staff had a good laugh when they thought of that one.The acting is of the highest Trek standards. Abraham, one of the true gentlemen in Hollywood, is exceptionally good as Ru'afo. He is so superior that he has every subtlety mastered. The way his face sneers when he says Eliminate them, his vocal inflections, his different postures, his mannerisms, the passion and disdain in his voice all point to the work of a true master. Hatred seems to perspire from his every pore. A blood vessel bursts in his face and we can almost see hate flowing out of it. His friend Gellatin (Gregg Henry) is constantly talking him out of more extreme decisions. For Ru'afo, it is personal, but we do not find out why until the final act. He tops it all off with the best scream of anguish and frustration ever captured on film. Ru'afo may not quite be the most effective Star Trek villain, but Abraham's acting is the best in the series. He is not the most prolific actor, but he is arguably one of the best ever.Sadly, some of the story devices fall flat. In First Contact, the Enterprise was the most advanced starship ever made. Its quantum torpedoes were so powerful that it seemed nigh invincible. Here, however, it is too weak. There is one exchange where it is fighting with two So'na ships and seems badly overmatched. The Enterprise-E was designed to take on small fleets and win. If the Federation could defeat the Borg, the Cardassians, the Dominion, why can't the crown jewel of its fleet defeat two So'na cruisers? It is even controlled at one point by simple joystick. I never knew flying a 700-meter starcraft was so simple. Redemption does come with the ingenious denouement of the fight. There are also other moments that do not work, and some jokes fall flat.In the end, Insurrection shoots itself in the foot. It also suffers from following First Contact and the Borg. It is an entirely different production with different goals. It may hurt itself, but in the end it is solid enough entertainment to rate a seven out of ten.

Star Wars started my lifelong love for the sci-fi and fantasy genres. However, until a couple of years ago I never bothered with Star Trek because it didn't look that interesting to me. However, J.J. Abrams' two Trek movies encouraged me to check out the other 10 and I am very glad that I did. Star Trek is a brilliant franchise, even with its weaker installments - it's a vehicle for creative and interesting ideas and great characters. Even at its worst (namely The Motion Picture and The Final Frontier), it has something good to offer. Or so I thought until I saw Star Trek Insurrection. This is not only the worst Star Trek movie, but one of the worst movies ever made, period. A lot of people are criticizing Star Trek Into Darkness, but at least that movie had a plot. The Final Frontier rightfully deserves all the flak it's getting too, but at least the villain had clear motivations. Insurrection has no plot, no intriguing ideas, no heart and no interesting characters. The story (if you can even call it that) is all over the place - it feels like it's being made up as it goes along. From the opening scene I was completely lost and had no idea what was going on, what the people in this movie were fighting for or why I should care at all. The inhabitants of the planet whose name I can't even remember are underdeveloped, have (apparently) magical powers that are never explained, and therefore it is impossible for me to feel a connection to them. The same goes for the crew of the Enterprise - the previous two Trek movies gave them character development, which was non-existent here and half the time they feel like over-the-top caricatures of themselves - even more so than the characters in Final Frontier. In fact, I'll go a step further - the opening titles of the film are lazy and bland. Every single Trek movie before that had grand opening titles accompanied by amazing music. The title of this movie just flashes by and that's it. The villains of the movie are one-dimensional, their motivations are impossible to understand and are impossible to take seriously. If you've seen the movie, you know what I'm talking about. And that's another thing that makes this movie fail all the villains in the previous movies - VGER, Khan, Kruge, Sybok, Chang, Soran, the Borg Queen - had clear motivations and were a legitimate threat - something the villains in this movie are not. I am astounded that Jonathan Frakes, who directed the brilliant First Contact, looked at the script for this movie and thought it was good. In conclusion, unless you are curious or are a completionist like myself, avoid this movie like the Plague. It is not worth your time. Final rating 1/10 (But in reality it deserves a 0).

I'm not one of those unconditional trekkies, but I liked this movie a lot.And this one, by actor/director Jonathan Frakes, is a good piece of entertainment. It's intelligent, sometimes surprising, has good action (albeit the tactics and manoeuvres  of Star Trek ships are quite ridiculous - whatever the movie) and the actors chosen for this one are good performers.The Star Trek Universe is complex, rich, but not my favourite. There seem to be holes in its consistency - technology seems to be less advanced in fields where it should have been far ahead, politics seems too much like politics on any country on Earth, and society a replica of USA's, Europe's or Japan's society, military tactics seem no different of manouvering battleships like Submarines, Frigates, Air Carriers, etc. At least, there is some effort to put some science into Star Trek - even if we do not know what metaphase is or why the explosion of metronium gas is so destructive in space.The script is too simple, I grant that. But the way Insurrection was shot, the special moments achieved, a couple of twists in the plot, a reasonable dose of uncertainty and humour, leads me to say we are in the presence of a Star Trek masterpiece.It's a pity that the main motor of events isn't some larger than life quest or fight (or is it?). Those of us who grew up familiar with the grand scale of events of the Star Wars saga, the details and realism of Blade Runner and Twelve Monkeys, the ingenuity of Batman, Dark City, The Matrix, expect of movies like Insurrection something that tops or equals these other masterpieces, and when that doesn't happen, something seems to fail.But Insurrection ends up being a good work by someone that had only directed some episodes of Star Trek - The next Generation.Well, the special effects are good, the acting is good (Patrick Stewart, Donna Murphy, Zerbe, Murray Abraham, Frakes, Levar Burton, Brent Spinner - they know exactly what to do and give this movie the extra-consistency), the soundtrack is ok.If mr. Jonathan Frakes read this, I would advise him to continue his good work but to seek more complex and elaborated scripts for Star Trek. If he chooses to direct other types of movies, he does have the talent.I hope you all enjoy this.

Patrick Stewart, Jonathan Frakes, Brent Spiner, LeVar Burton, Michael Dorn, Gates McFadden and Marina Sirtis once again give an awesome performance and bring more life to these characters we've grown to love over these past 12 years.This movie cost 50 million to produce and still lacked the intensity we've seen on Star Trek First Contact and Star Trek Generations. I guess it was time to produce a light hearted movie for a change.This movie and its story can be displayed as a light hearted story in the midst of a galaxy enveloped in chaos, war and tragedy. With the events of Star Trek Deep Space Nine and Star Trek Voyager making the timeline of the Star Trek universe, Star Trek has been changing dramatically ever since The Next Generation's 3rd or 4th Season.This movie was even funnier than Star Trek IV The Voyage Home. Picard, Riker and Data were more funny than ever! The story and action scenes mix perfectly as well as the comedy and the story. I loved the scene where Picard and Worf chase Data in the planet's atmosphere and begin singing that hilarious song.Jonathan Frakes takes the director's chair for the second time in a row. Already a veteran directing Next Generation episodes he truly knows how to make a movie come to life. I only hated seeing Michael Piller writing the movie. He took off Data's emotion chip! I don't want to see another Star Trek movie written by him. Bring Brannon Braga and Ronald D. Moore back to the writing!This movie also marks the first direct violation of the Prime Directive by Picard himself! I never believed he would actually break the chain of command. Sadly however, the movie's ending was just not worth it. Picard should still have been arrested on the charges of treason and insurrection. That happened to Sheridan on the end of the 4th Season on Babylon 5 after he took back Earth.But it's still a movie worth watching! I only hope the next Star Trek movie comes packed with lots of action and intensity like we've seen on First Contact!Great job Paramount!

After the fantastic film that was 'Star Trek First Contact', the director and writer to decided to create a ninth installment to this franchise that would fail, just to what..keep the pattern going? All the bad Star Trek films suffer in the same way. They have bad direction, lousy writing, poor explanation of the plot, uninteresting characters and have extremely uninteresting special effects and cinematography. When we look at the previous installment, there were some fantastic special effects and good action sequences, had great writing and directing and had an interesting plot. This film, is Star Trek First Contact or even Star Trek Wrath of Khan done horribly.During this film, Captain Picard played by Patrick Stewart, learns that there is a Federation dispute between the Ba'ku and the Son'a. Apparently the Son'a have begun a plot to wipe out the Ba'ku in order to regenerate the city from scrap. Hearing about this, following a malfunction of the often frustrating Data, Captain Picard and his Enterprise must prevent this Federation dispute from being completed.The plot to the film was rather difficult for me to follow simply because there wasn't enough explanation of the plot. This film is close to unbearable for me, almost topping Generations in its horribility factor. The characters are extremely uninteresting, even the ones we already know about and the romance plot in this film with Picard and the Ba'ku is extremely stupid and it made me want to grab a phaser and kill myself! The plot itself nearly made me kill myself, it was that frustrating. If these Star Trek odd numbered films do one thing, it is that they nearly make me want to commit suicide- that is all about Star Trek III Search for Spock.The special effects were truly bad in my opinion, in this film. First Contact had some great effects and an interesting story. It had fine cinematography but this film throws aside all the great things about First Contact. Apparently this film was the first to use CGI effects but boy, does everything look cheaper than ever before. It is clearly evident that when it comes to an odd numbered Star Trek film, that the director and writer completely ignore everything good about the predecessor. Let us pray that Star Trek Into Darkness, being the twelfth installment can live up to the hype...and the bloody PATTERN The reason that the New Generations films do not work well, except for First Contact which was something miraculous, is the fact that the characters simply cannot measure about to those of the original crew. They aren't interesting.Star Trek Insurrection is everything horrible about the odd numbered Star Trek films and suffers considerably from lousy writing, bad direction, horrid special effects, uninteresting cinematography and most importantly, a terrible plot. If the plan of the film was to simply follow the pattern of the odd numbered films, then this film certainly did its job but I simply don't understand.

I understand that Frakes himself now concedes this film was a flawed endeavor. (At least that's what I've read.) Fundamentally, this movie presents as a mediocre two hour episode of the television series. What little plot there is, is lifted straight from several classic episodes, especially one where Data must convince a bunch of colonists to evacuate.The fatal flaw is the ridiculous premise that several hundred settlers are more important than a war which affects billions of people. Picard's motives are never remotely convincing, and everything seems forced, which it is.All too predictably, the enemy has a doomsday weapon which Picard must transport over to, and deactivate, during the climax.The rest of the movie is similarly cliché'd.

The movies has so many magical moments and it very clearly dismisses the myth that the odd-numbered movies are worse than the others. It is not so much an action science fiction as First Contact, but Star Trek is NOT about action. I guess this is why I like the episodes with virtually no action and much character development and tests on the characters and how they cope with different situations the best. The movies does have some cliché dialog, like when Data saying 'Sattle up.

Here it is, in a nutshell- A tiny number of space colonists (called the Baku) land on a planet and find a fountain of youth there. None of them age or die or even get ill. They stay on the planet for a couple of centuries and there's now a population of 600 there (gosh, either they're VERY inbred or they don't have kids very often!).- The Federation (within whose territory the planet lies) would like everyone in the galaxy to have access to this fountain, and not just the 600 space colonists. To do this they want to move the colonists to another similar planet while they set up equipment to make the fountain available to everyone (including the 600 space colonists).- Picard & co think the space colonists should be entitled to stay on the planet as long as they like, with the planet to themselves, and no one else is allowed to touch the planet.Now, in case you can't spot the flaw in this already, allow me to assistWhy are the 600 Baku colonists entitled to the ENTIRE PLANET FOREVER while the rest of the Galaxy shouldn't set foot there? I could at least understand the moral argument if the Baku were native to the planet, but they're not, they're interstellar colonists (many of them first generation settlers) just like the people trying to evict them. What is the moral argument for Picard taking sides in what's clearly a straightforward turf war?Worse than that, why are the 600 Baku entitled to ETERNAL LIFE (having already enjoyed several illness-free centuries of bonus time) while countless millions suffering elsewhere (including the supposed villains of the whole film!) aren't given access to the fountain?Now, I know the Federation is meant to be an idealistic vision, but it's not meant to be an absurd parody. Even if the Baku had been native to the planet (which they're not), the 600 figure is just way way way too small to sound plausible as a reason for Picard's rebellion (goodness me, there are more people on board the Enterprise!).Yes, I know Picard gives a speech where he says how many before it becomes immoral?, but by that logic he would have rebelled against the federation even if there was just 1 colonist. Can you imagine how plausible the film would have seemed then? (Don't worry, Mr Baku, we and our entire crew of hundreds will die to protect your illness-free immortal lifestyle on your own private planet!)To sum up, this film supposedly tries to make a point about ethnic cleansing in Bosnia and elsewhere, but by removing all traces of the horror (the murders, the death camps, the torture, the rapes, the mass graves, the genocide, the bloodfeuds, the poisonous nationalists on *all* sides) and by making the Baku first-generation colonists rather than natives, what you have left is a comparatively minor, questionable and extremely boring treatise on international property rights.It's like watching a film discussing Norway's claim to Antarctica.

I even enjoy movies that aren't necessarily well made, that might even have gaping plot holes, but those have to give me something to like them. Here, it's just a bland, 100 minute movie filled with uninteresting side characters and some really forgettable villains. I know there's the whole, this is just like an episode of the TV series, but the two-part episodes in TNG were way better than this. This movie is more like a two-part episode of Voyager. While it is fun to see the crew behaving a little more&#x85;young, it more or less just feels like an excuse to have them act out of character. The Son'a aren't overly interesting either, which doesn't help matters, though their back-story felt like it had potential. They just kind of have a dull plain and they never get much personality of their own, aside from their obsession with immortality. Seriously, this is only worth watching if you're a trekkie, and even then, this isn't a movie you want to re-watch too much.

The lion's share of the movie centers on Picard most of the senior staff fighting for the Ba'ku, but the real excitement was with Riker and LaForge aboard the Enterprise. Things actually happened in those scenes, but the enjoyment was short-lived before cutting back to the condescending wine country people. There's a lot to be said here for Jonathan Frakes' direction, but this story goes down like flavorless gruel.5/10*It's not every day you can write something up about Star Trek and quote Last Action Hero.

There's little more I can add to that. And, if you liked The Next Generation's small-screen outings, then you should enjoy this.However, the films were always supposed to appeal to a wider audience, therefore they were expected to be bigger, bolder and louder. Plus Insurrection follows the excellent Star Trek 8 Fist Contact, which really took 'Trek' in a new, more action-orientated direction. Therefore Insurrection always felt like a step backwards.There's nothing wrong with this film, in fact, it's actually quite enjoyable. However, unless you're a die hard fan, you probably won't find it that interesting and there are certainly better Trek movies than this one.

This is most certainly true, but in some ways it's one of the film's strengths.For better or worse, the 'Next Generation' TV series fully embraced the utopist, secular-humanistic philosophy of Gene Roddenberry that was always bubbling below the surface of its more adventure oriented predecessor. It was very much a reflection of the Clinton Era. Touchy-feely, activist and slightly smug and condescending in an I know better than you. sort of way. But it was also very sincere in its intentions, and I for one believe 'Insurrection' benefits by embracing this and staying true to its roots.The cast all seem to genuinely be having fun, a testament to their real life friendship and the presence of fellow cast mate Jonathan Frakes behind the camera. The story and plot are full of holes you could fly the Enterprise through, but the spirit and tone here absolutely nail what the 'Next Generation' was in its very soul. Because of this, I believe 'Star Trek Insurrection' comes the closest of any of the 12 theatrically released 'Trek' films of capturing the spirit of its TV incarnation. That itself is noteworthy and commendable.

INSURRECTION feels like nothing more than a strung-out episode of STAR TREK THE NEXT GENERATION, with the actors going through their paces and finding themselves challenged by a thoroughly small-scale drama.The villain of the piece is an almost unrecognisable F. Murray Abraham, who's wasted as one of a race of plastic surgery-obsessed aliens who plan to strip a planet of its nature resources. Anthony Zerbe shows up as a stuffy officious type, while the crew of THE NEXT GENERATION are all present and correct. And for fans of the show, it's not particularly bad either; there's the requisite romance, drama and special effects. It's just that, to me, nothing particularly stands out.

However, it feels like a very good two-part TNG story and, since TNG is one of my favourite series, it's not a major problem for me. That said, I don't think that it has the same appeal to fans and non-fans alike as the best films in the series such as The Wrath of Khan, First Contact and The Voyage Home. Jonathan Frakes does an excellent job in directing the film and he should have been retained for Nemesis. The fact that he shaves his beard, however, disproves my theory that his powers come from his facial hair in much the same way as Samson's came from his locks.Oscar winner F. Murray Abraham makes for a very compelling villain as Ru'afo. Donna Murphy is absolutely enchanting as Anij, Picard's third and final serious love interest, and she has great chemistry with Patrick Stewart. Anthony Zerbe is very good as Admiral Dougherty, who hearkens back to the TOS tradition of admirals and other senior people being antagonists! Given their significant screen time, I was surprised that Daniel Hugh Kelly, Gregg Henry and Michael Welch's names aren't mentioned in the opening credits. The then 11-year-old Welch, who has gone on to have a good film and TV career, is very natural as Artim, whose relationship with Data is very sweet. He's a very good young actor who was excellent as Jack O'Neill's clone in Stargate SG-1's Fragile Balance, one of my favourite episodes of that series. DS9 actors Armin Shimerman and Max Grodénchik were to have cameos - the former as Quark and the latter as a Trill ensign - but both scenes were cut. Had Quark's scene been included, he would have been the only DS9 regular character besides Worf to appear in a Star Trek film.Michael Piller's final contribution to Star Trek before his untimely death in 2005, it has a strong storyline with some great social commentary regarding the forced relocation of people and the ways in which imperialism and colonialism have led to larger cultures destroying smaller ones. Picard is one of my favourite television characters as he is a man of honour and integrity who can always be relied upon to do the right thing. He knows when to take a stand and always places morality above rules and regulations. Stewart is wonderful as ever as Picard. The crew's behaviour succeeds in shaming Dougherty but it is too late as he is murdered by Ru'afo in a rather gruesome scene - particularly by Star Trek standards - which recalls the death of Zerbe's character Milton Krest in Licence to Kill. Their efforts to shame the Federation Council into changing their decision, however, are more successful. The actions of the Federation in this film highlight the problem with Spock's maxim, The needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few. Or the one. it only works if it is the few who are doing the deciding. Otherwise, it can be used to justify anything from a tiny tax increase to genocide.Overall, I think that this is a very good, sorely underrated film and the strongest of the odd numbered films.

There's seem to be little or no attempt to broaden the movie's appeal outside dedicated fans without a big name actor to square off against Picard and co (all we get are a heavily made-up F Murray Abraham and rent-a-face Antjony Zerbe) and a story that looks and feels like a two-parter from the TV series presented on the big screen and a not very good two-parter at that.It doesn't help that you can see old father time catching up on our favourite crew members apart from the Captain, who of course never looked young in the first place. Even Data looks older and that of course should be impossible, although Brent Spiner seems to have filled out a little less than Geordi or Riker. The story-line leaves little for the two main female cast members, Troi and Dr Crusher, to do plus just where was wunderkind Wesley.I sort of get the allusions to contemporary events in the world at around this time over the Serbia / Bosnia conflict in the old Yugoslavia and of course laudable that Picard jettisons the Starfleet Prime Directive of non-interference to save the native species, but even then his noble action appears to be as much about wooing an attractive female he encounters on the planet surface as being a big humanitarian.As a film too it moves too slowly and unexcitingly. There are attempts at humour, as ever, involving Data, but these fall flat especially when he joins his captain in bellowing out an old Gilbert and Sullivan tune for some desperately important reason I can't even remember just now while director Frakes gets the awkward job of filming himself and Troi getting frisky with each other. This is nothing however compared to the cringe-worthy scene when Picard briefly attempts to dance the samba in a bid to recapture his youth.There was also no big race-against-time cliffhanging finish which I felt the film needed, indeed, as said earlier, I found the pacing, dialogue and editing to be poor throughout.

The natives have a tremendously valuable resource that everyone else wants. Immortality -- that's a pretty valuable resource.Plot Flaw... How could any altruistic race not offer immortality to anyone who wanted it? The natives never, ever offer their gift to anyone, in the entire film. They're jerks -- but the film treats them like perfect angels throughout.That minor point aside, however... the basic point is that you cannot force even a small number of people to sacrifice themselves for the greater good. Once again, the plot device is poorly conceived, but the concept is valid. It's a Star Trek morality play in pretty good form.Plot Flaw #2... The Starfleet Admiral (Dougherty), the Commander of the Whosits (Son'a) -- Ru'afo -- and many of the Son'a men are held in custody aboard the Enterprise. Picard should have thrown them all in the brig -- Clear Violation of several laws and regulations. As the next-senior Starfleet officer at the scene, he had the authority, and the obligation, to do that. Any officer can toss his senior in jail for a direct violation of regulations. It's true today, and it's true in that theoretical future.However, we'd then be left with a 70-minute movie and no action. So, Picard flagrantly disregards his responsibilities and decides to go renegade instead. He gives up the power of the Enterprise and all of its resources to go it alone, with the supposed hope of an ultimately unsuccessful attempt to contact Starfleet through the Enterprise and its remaining crew. It almost Costs him his ship.It was an honest attempt at a morality play, that went horribly wrong.

It certainly has flaws, but holds up as great entertainment and takes a different approach from the previous two films. It actually feels more like a cinematic episode of the series, the focus slightly less on action, and more on ideas and character. Lighter in tone than First Contact (the Borg and the implications they bring have always made them one of science fiction's best villains), the film follows the Enterprise crew as an investigation into the malfunction of Data which leads to a hilarious musical number leads them to the discovery of a race of ancient people who don't age due to the...stuff in the planet's rings (this film is particularly heavy of the Trek technobabble). They then discover a conspiracy between the federation and an interstellar race known as the Sorn to relocate the B'aku so they can mine the...stuff that prevents ageing and makes you go back to puberty. I don't know. It makes about as much sense as any of the pseudo-science from the show. So it doesn't really matter, it's up to the crew to save the B'aku (who can't save themselves because they rejected the use of technology despite using a fully functioning irrigation system, go figure), by any means necessary between being shaved in the tub by Deanna Troi and talking about the firmness of their breasts. Picard seems strangely adamant about protecting the rights of the B'aku despite having relocated a group of Native Americans in season 7 of the show. So despite the many nods to the show that'll make fans cream themselves, it's best not to approach this with a rigid sense of continuity in regards to the canon. One of the strongest points of the film for me was the beautiful photography and outstanding effects. The first computer-generated Enterprise looks magnificent battling it out in nebulae while the magic anti-aging planet looks like a paradise.So it's an excellent adventure film, just not on the level of First Contact. The performances are as you'd expect, the Enterprise crew still undoubtedly the Enterprise crew many years past the show. F. Murray Abraham also makes a cool villain. Now the only TNG film I have to see is Nemesis.

Even so, when a Star Trek movie comes to the screen, I do drag myself out simply to see what it is like. My brother also wanted to see it so I decided that I would, and I am glad that I did because it was far better than the other two.Insurrection is a plot that twists and invites the viewer to work out what is going on. As well as being science fiction, it takes a far better approach that simply flashing Borg in front of us hoping to impress us. Instead it opens up with a problem and everything slowly unravels as the movie goes on.The movie begins on a planet among a peaceful society and the Federation, using personal cloaking devices, are monitoring these people. Suddenly Data malfunctions and reveals these spies to the village. The Enterprise is asked for the schematics and instead of simply giving it to Star Fleet, they travel to the planet to see what the problem is. The planet happens to be located in the middle of a large nebula and as such no communication out is possible, thus what is going on on the planet is hidden from the Federation, even though one of the admirals is involved.The thing about the planet is that the rings produce rejuvenating rays which restores body tissue. This is the secret of eternal youth which everybody is looking for. Such a benefit always comes with a disadvantage &#x96; and this seems to be a common plot in Star Trek &#x96; all other problems have been solved but people still die, so what can we do about it.This mimics humanities fear of death. They take everything away but there is still death so they decide to create a way in which to eliminate that as well. What Star Trek really is is humanities desire to live in a better world without having to submit to a supreme authority &#x96; God. I have had arguments regarding the morality of Star Trek with numerous trekkie friends and will always remain firm that the reason that I hate Star Trek is that they are openly against religion and claim that humanity can solve all of the world's problems itself. This I just cannot believe because in 6000 years of recorded human history we may have advanced technologically and culturally, but the same problems that faced our ancient ancestors face us today, so what makes us think we can solve them in a few hundred years. Maybe we argue that we have been evolving, but all we have to do is look at the social decay within America as everybody becomes hyper-individualistic to realise that this is not the case.I did like this movie and was suitably impressed, even with one that Jonathon Frakes directed. I was not suitably impressed with some of Frakes' directions as they generally seem nice and idealistic and generally sickening, but this was good.

I really feel that nothing was done. No step forward was made for the characters. Even in the worst Star Trek movie, The Final Frontier, something was accomplished. This film has no reason to exist.The crew of the U. S. S. Enterprise discover a planet inhabited by a people called the Ba'ku, who have lived on this planet for 300 years. The planet has some kind of scientific explanation (don't ask me exactly what, I'm not a scientist) that keeps the inhabitants from getting old. However, the Federation wants to put them in a holographic representation of their home on another planet because they want to use the planet to heal billions. Captain Picard (Patrick Stewart) and the rest of the crew want to stop this because they want the Ba'ku to stay on their planet.Now here is our first problem the premise is ridiculous. Picard wants to move the Ba'ku, even though billions could be healed by the planet. But there was a Star Trek line that really summed this situation up. Remember that line Spock had in The Wrath of Khan? For those of you who don't know, the needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few. Wow. The writers went against their own franchise lessons. Also, why does the Federation need to move the colony? Can't the Ba'ku stay with other immigrants there as well?And the film takes so long to get to the point. The first hour is just the Enterprise crew getting to know the Ba'ku and the Federation planning their supposedly EVIL yet logical plan.Then there are the characters. There's no real focus on them, and no real development. A Ba'ku woman named Anij (Donna Murphy) gets a lot of screen time, yet she is utterly boring and plays no part. The villain, an alien named Ru'afo (F. Murray Abraham) is also boring, and doesn't really accomplish much.There are so many awkward, pointless, and stupid moments. There's a scene where a blue alien asks Picard if he read his paper on some techno babble, and he's never seen again. There is also a scene where android Data (Brent Spiner) loses control, and Picard tries to bring back his mind by singing Gilbert and Sullivan, because he is familiar with those two. No kidding. Singing Picard, Data, and Klingon crew member Worf (Michael Dorn) is so dumb I actually laughed.The one idea I like is the planet that heals and stops age. That is a neat idea.

The Federation, down on allies, are getting Captain Picard to persuade new species to join and down on the planet of the Ba'ku, Data has a malfunctioning problem and takes the inhabitants, and the Federation members investigating it, hostage. From here Captain Picard is sent to retrieve Data and find out his problem. What follows is one of the most cringing moments I have seen in film history. By singing the song 'A British Tar' to him, Picard manages to hypnotise Data and the pair along with Michael Dorn's Worf, begin to sing at the top of their voices. Luckily this is one of the very few problems I have with this film. Although it does seem like a lengthened version of a TV episode, it is such a charming and pleasant film that I found it impossible not to like.The film's plot revolves around the planet of Ba'Ku, which has extremely exclusive minerals and nutrients that make you younger. The Federation, under pressure from the So'na race, wants to evacuate the planet so that the So'na can take control of the planet's resources. However, after viewing the small, but beautiful planet and falling in love with one of its inhabitants, Captain Jean-Luc Picard of the U.S.S Enterprise begins a rebellion to save the planet of six hundred citizens. In First Contact, the crew were saving the world, so saving six hundred people in the sequel may seem like a step down. However, First Contact came across very flat, whereas Insurrection retains the old crew's human elements and the need to do something for the greater good &#x96; not because they have to. In the Next Generation's previous instalments, there was little focus on characters apart from Picard and Data. However, Insurrection focuses on other crew-members and from this, comes a wonderful and well-matched relationship between director Jonathan Frakes and Marina Sirtis' Riker and Troi. Patrick Stewart gives a calming performance on screen and develops a wonderful bond and chemistry with love interest Donna Murphy. F.Murray Abraham also gives a good performance as the main So'na villain. The cinematography on the supposed 'paradise' planet is very nice and the action scenes both on the planet and in space are mixed with good visuals. The third act does drag on but the excitement is re-submitted successfully as a great secret is revealed towards the film's finale.

It was actually the Excelsior that was on the cataloging mission, not the Enterprise. Similarly, very few people seem to question the character of Zefram Cochrane in First Contact. How can a drunken fool like him build such an advanced ship with only a handful of people and no money?When it comes to the odd numbered movies such as Insurrection, I have seen people looking for the smallest little plot holes and making a big deal about it. If people can overlook errors such as the ones in Star Trek VI or First Contact, who really cares why Worf was on the Enterprise or if Counselor Troi had really kissed Riker with a beard before! Even Star Trek III The Search For Spock was a reasonable movie. If it had been an even numbered one, I'm sure many people would look back more favourably at it.Many reviews of Insurrection will automatically mark it down simply because they expect an odd numbered Star Trek movie to be a bad one. Instead of looking for the good points, many people only look for the bad points in the odd numbered ones. When I first saw this movie I had read a number of very negative reviews.

To a seasoned Trekker, Insurrection looked like a real rip-off nothing more than a Captain Kirk plot (leading a one-ship rebellion against the injust decision of the Federation) with the Next Generation pasted into it.  Wrong!  Insurrection was an incredibly original and thrilling film, combining the depth of thought present in all Star Trek series and films, the humor that was found to be a success in Generations and First Contact, and special effects and action that will please the modern audience.Warning!  Semi-Spoiler!  (Nothing that's not in the IMDb summary, though).The movie's premise is one that harkens back to the political symbolism that has been used successfully throughout TOS, TNG, the movies, and is used slightly in DS9 and VOY.  The most successful Star Trek stories are those that are actual historical events thrown into the 24th century; this is no exception.  The Federation is determined to force-relocate the population of a planet out in the wilderness of space.  Their cause is noble enough the planet has a special metaphysical property that can reverse the aging process, which would double lifespans, cure diseases, heal injuries, and be an all-around good thing.  Their methods, however, are despicable they plan to abduct these 600 people in their sleep and move them out of their homes, onto a holodeck recreation.  This parallels the frontier expansion into Native American territories of the 1800s, particularly the Trail of Tears. Captain Picard, obviously the voice that speaks out for justice, will not allow this to happen, and decides to risk himself, his ship, and his crew to save these people.  The movie progresses from there.Now, take this excellent plot and moral debate, and throw in more quality humor than you can possibly expect from a sci-fi film, and you've got a rockin' good time!  Ranging from diplomatic guests who eat floral arrangements to performances of Gilbert and Sullivan in the midst of a battle to Klingon pimples, I was rolling in the aisles every second that I wasn't on the edge of my seat.  You simply can't beat Data comparing Riker's shaved face to an android's bottom, or Worf re-entering Klingon adolescence and feeling aggressive tendencies.  It's just too good to be true.Overall, this film congealed into the epitome of excellence, scoring a solid 9.8 (that tough Romulan judge gave it a 9.6).

But every time it has been used, it wasn't a true fountain of youth. In Star Trek Insurrection it is genuine.Rick Berman and the other cast members have the audacity to say that this film was the best Star Trek film since Star Trek The Motion Picture.

In Star Trek Generations he is a total wimp. In Star Trek First Contact we see for the first time, a sign of bitter rage from Captain Picard. Unfortunately, he has dropped it for the more role model look for humanity in this film.Data's character has changed dramatically since Star Trek The Next Generation. But what is unsettling about this film, is that Data never even sets foot on the bridge!Riker's character has reverted back to it's boyish character from season one of TNG.

Or someone else.Counselor Troi has changed for the better since Star Trek The Next Generation. I can remember in Disaster she didn't know a sensor array from a tricorder. In Star Trek Insurrection she uses a tricorder and wants to vaporize things with her phaser! A good film for her.Worf needs to find a place and stay there. It was very un Trek-Like to have Worf's reason for being on the U.S.S. Enterprise interrupted by Riker and Geordi. Since he left Deep Space Nine to be the ambassador to Kronos, it is doubtful he will return in Star Trek XGeordi has returned to the bridge. In the first season of Star Trek The Next Generation, he was the pilot for the ship, but then becomes the chief engineer. In Star Trek Insurrection, we don't know if he is the pilot or the engineer.Ru'Afo is definately not up to par as a villian. He has every chance to evilliy take the planet, but he just sits in his office and pouts. When he kills Admiral Dougherty, it is just to re-assure us that he is the bad guy.Anij is not any Lily Sloane. Lily was a better love interest for Captain Picard because she could relate to our time, but Anij seems like she is from the 17th century, but she is more attractive that Lily.And finally Admiral Dougherty. Anthony Zerbe?! I can think of a few more people that would play him better. Like Robert DeNiro, or Sean Connery.In summary, Star Trek Insurrection may be a disappointment, but it depends on what genre of Star Trek fan you are. If you liked the Dominion War saga from Star Trek Deep Space Nine this movie isn't for you. But if you were a person who watched Star Trek because of its optimistic outlook of the future, than you'd like it. It's like Captain Picard said Can anyone remember when we used to be explorers?Besides, if they used this film for character development, just imagine what Star Trek X will be like.

When TNG ran on television, Worf was one of my favorite characters.  When he moved to DS9, however, he quickly became my most hated Trek character (even above Chakotay and Neelix, both of whom kept me from ever enjoying a single Voyager episode).  He's on DS9 now, why the **** is he here?  At least in the last movie, his appearance almost made sense.  Even Sulu had *reasons* for showing up after he got his own command in the last few TOS movies! On the other hand, this movie is, for the first time in a long time, a step in the right direction for Trek in general.  Since Roddenberry's death, Trek in general has gone downhill, and I'd almost be happy to see the whole franchise fall than put up with any more movies like First Contact.Those of you who're calling for the next movie to be the last TNG movie -- well, it's better than the alternative; DS9 or Voyager movies.

First Contact was a lot of fun and had plenty of action, but the plot was full of holes.  Insurrection has a tight plot and a story that knows its bounds.   This movie's strength is that it knows the story is not large enough in scope to warrant excessive dramatics and epic subplots (the weakness that killed Generations).  The storyline, which shows an alien race trying to harness (and deplete) the natural resources of an inhabited planet with the blessing of the Federation, is tighter than it first appears to be.  The most commonly asked question is, Why don't the aliens just find someplace to live on the planet?  Then they will receive the benefit of the fountain of youth rings without relocating anyone.  But the aliens want to live in space.  They want to live as explorers, so they are trying to have the best of both worlds.   Still, it's not a grand plot, so it's not a grand movie.  The entire movie (except when we first see the Enterprise) takes place in a single solar system.  The trek across the planet's surface is given sufficient treatment, but Frakes, as director, knows when to cut it short.  I will admit that there are a couple of weak scenes, but only a couple.  The rest of the movie moves at a good pace with solid performances all around.  What more do you need?

The story and character development are really not sufficiently grand or large scale enough for a movie. Of course, the special effects are definitely theatre quality, but sfx alone do not a good Star Trek make. The plot alone is just not big enough. We've seen prime directive motivated stories many times through most of the franchise shows (from original series through to Voyager). We've seen utopia-type cultures many times, too. Even the fountain-of-youth kinda plot has been used a few times before. Okay, this was an interesting mix of the three, but there just wasn't anything different enough about this one to really make it work. Star Trek motion picture plots should - in my opinion at least - be painted on a much broader canvas. Take 'Undiscovered Country', for example - despite it's reliance on a murder mystery, some pretty corny Kirk-jokes, and an anti-climactic ending, at least we were talking about a big, large-canvas issue.The relationships between the crew are not working as well in this one, I feel. Certainly the renewed romance between Troi and Riker comes across as forced and unimaginative - the dialogue is trite, and the performances just don't carry it off. Data is, yet again, wasted (except, perhaps, for the firm boobs line...). Worf had something of a contribution to make to the humour (Definitely experiencing aggressive tendencies, Sir!), but was otherwise underused. But some of the wink-wink, buddy-buddy stuff was excruciating, and reminiscent of the worst of Wesley Crusher.Picard's relationship with Anij could have been better developed and explored. It's becoming a little cliched to have the captain (any captain) find romance with the first good-looking support character that comes along - it was often one of the worst aspects of the original series. There were a few little differences in this one, but they weren't fully explored, and Donna Murphy was certainly underutilised.Whilst this one was good, I won't be placing it at the top of my ordered list of Star Trek movies. It's not the worst, but it's not the best.If this franchise is going to last at the cinemas, then the producers are going to have to start thinking BIG. Not only was there little visually in this one (other than the superior effects) that wouldn't have worked on the smaller screen (even the colonist's village seemed like a set from the TV show), but the opportunity to explore bigger issues and more complex plots was also wasted.  "},{"Title":"Not very good","Date":"31 December 2000","Score":"","Genre":"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi","Review":"  Star Trek has been the inspiration for what is arguably one of the best ongoing movie series ever, right up there with James Bond.  For more than twenty years, the Enterprise has graced the silver screen.  While many of these films have been very entertaining, the odd-numbered ones have always been somewhat lacking.  This has caused many people to say that there is an odd-number curse plaguing the Trek film series.For the most part, I'd have to say that's true, but Star Trek III is a strong argument against the curse theory.  It's certainly not a classic, but it is a good and entertaining film.Insurrection, on the other hand, is a strong argument supporting the curse theory.  I would have to say that this is one of the worst Trek features to date.  Don't get me wrong, it's not nearly as bad as Star Trek V. But at times it gets dangerously close.The biggest problem is the script.  In a nutshell, here is the plot  There is an implausible alien race called the Ba'ku that live peacefully all alone on a planet whose rings provide a fountain of youth-like effect on these people, keeping them youthful for all eternity.  The Ba'ku do not believe in using any sort of advanced technology unless it suits their needs, so they're really in trouble when another race called the So'na wants to relocate them so they can benefit from the effects of the planet's rings. And they'll do this without the Ba'ku even knowing about it, because the Federation is helping them, and they have a holodeck spaceship that will allow the Ba'ku to be transported away from their homeworld without ever realizing they have left their village?Confused?It makes slightly more sense if you see the movie, but the plot is still pretty confusing.  It's also pretty stupid.  I don't get why the Federation would be helping the So'na with this.  Non-Trekkies probably could care less, but any Star Trek fan could tell you that the Federation is all about peace, and this just doesn't seem like a very peaceful pursuit.One of the most annoying things about this movie was the effects.  This film had a generous budget, and that shows through some of the time.  Some cases in point are the CGI creatures a hummingbird and a pocket-walrus thingie that are both pretty cool, but put together they couldn't have more than thirty seconds of screen time.  What really gets me are all the space sequences.  Supposedly, they were done all on computers by the company that does the effects for the Star Trek TV shows.  All-CG spaceships are fine for TV shows, but in a big-screen feature you expect more.  The ships in this film look all right when they're farther away from the camera. But when they are closer to the screen, they look like CGI.  The new Enterprise-E, which looked so beautiful in First Contact, looks like a reject from Star Trek Voyager in this one.There are many other things wrong with this movie, but I doubt I can hold your attention long enough.  I just hope Star Trek X is better.  Even if it does turn out to be the last Trek film (for the Next Generation crew, anyway) it would have to be a much better send-off than this crud.After all, it'll be an even-numbered film.

Then I wanted to say, it is not a bad movie, but it is simply no blockbuster, but a tv show like adventure, which does not fit to the big screen.Firstly, the acting was not bad, but it also was not very good. Patrick Stewart gave his usual good performance as Picard.(not as good as in First Contact) Brent Spiner and the rest of the regular cast did also very well, too. As a fan I certainly liked the scenes between Riker and Troi. (Marina Sirtis looks better than ever)Secondly, the direction. I think you cannot blame the direction (Jonathan Frakes), if the writing is this bad, because Jonathan Frakes already showed us that he is a capable director,just think of First Contact or various Star Trek tv shows.Next, the biggest disappointment of the movie, the sets and visual effects. The Enterprise-E is about 700 meters in length, 100 meters longer than the old one. The old Enterprise-D had ten forward as a location for festivals , and what does the Enterprise-E have? An altered version of the observation lounge set, smaller and less impressive as ten forward, and certainly not the scale for a 60 million dollar movie. Why did not they enlarge the set by computer images? Then, the Bakoo village, same as the interior of the Enterprise, too small, or do you believe 600 people have enough living space in ten huts? You certainly do not, because it is unbelievable. Again my question. Why did not the producers just build up three huts and create the rest by computer images and mate paintings, instead of building an expansive full scale village. Don´t tell me it is not possible today by using computers, because I know it is and because George Lucas did it without computers in 1976, by using paintings to enlarge the death star sets. The visual effects of the space scenes did not convince me either. They looked faked and computer like clean and they have (forgive me the expression) no soul. The producers had better got ILM for the job, because their effects are always fantastic ( forget Spawn) and have a soul.(frankly I prefer models, because you know at least they blew something up,  not just computer animated graphics.) At last , the action in Insurrection. (the rhyme is a coincidence) Let´s talk about the action. Which action you might ask and you are right, there is no action. All I saw was a bid of fighting against boring flying drones and photon torpedos impacting on the planet´s surface just causing minor damages. (remember, they once could destroy whole star ships with shields)Okay, that´s the end.

It's visually astonishing. Along with Jerry Goldsmith's outstanding soundtrack, this movie takes us in an unbelievable journey. Insurrection displays the best location filming ever featured in Star Trek history. The Ba'Ku homeworld has spetacular features and visuals.The movie's 3 bottom lines are1.Bad Screenplay2.Excessive use of humor coupled with unreal reactions of the actors.3.100 minutes of duration (too short for the movie's storyline)The movie's screenplay was written by Michael Piller based upon his and Rick Berman's story. Michael Piller is an excellent writer if this were to be a TV episode or movie. Piller's skills aren't good for the big screen. I have no doubt Insurrection would have pulled high ratings along the best Deep Space Nine episodes if it were broadcast directly on TV, instead of opening it on movie theatres.It was a mistake from Frakes and Piller to attempt overshadowing First Contact and The Voyage Home in the humor arena. It was forced. Some scenes were outstanding such as when Picard and Worf sing A British Tar and Worf surrendering the So'Na claiming they want to negotiate a cease-fire because they only have three minutes of air left aboard their ship. There were also extremely awful scenes such as Beverly and Deanna commenting about boobs.Even without Industrial Light and Magic, the movie's visual and special effects were still outstanding. Star Trek always holds its own in that area.If it weren't for Michael Piller's screenplay, this could have been the best Star Trek story to date. Rick Berman did an excellent job in creating a very dramatic and insightful story about the Ba'Ku and the So'Na with the Enterprise crew caught in the middle of the story. This story was perfectly crafted to concide in the very middle of the Dominion War taking place during DS9's 6th and 7th seasons. It was a light-hearted story in the middle of highly dramatic stories taking place throughout the Alpha Quadrant.I loved Picard's moments with Anij. But it should have been more explored. There wasn't even a single kiss! On the other hand, it was great to see Riker and Deanna finally get together. The return of Geordi's sight turned out to be one of the best parts in the movie. Insurrection was great storytelling featuring intense character development.It was awful however to see Worf's puberty or his gorch. He should have never been brought to this movie on the first place. His visit on the Enterprise isn't even explained. He should be on Deep Space Nine following his own storyline (grieving the loss of his wife and eventually the events which would make him the ambassador of Kronos in the end of DS9).Data's performance wasn't affected and it was interesting to see his scenes with the young Ba'Ku boy, Artim. I only wish he had brought his emotion chip with him. I understand it was Michael Piller's decision not to feature the chip again. I hope to see an emotional Data on the next Star Trek movie.The villain Ru'Afo was badly developed. He could have been more menacing. Not as menacing as the Borg were in the previous movie, but as menacing as Khan or Soran.The cast is outstanding! I just don't want to see another forced comedy in the next movie. Brannon Braga and Ronald D Moore are the truly excellent writers of Star Trek movies.The space battles were a disappointment, but I loved that subspace weapon used by the So'Na. What would have happened if the subspace tear had caught the Enterprise?Overall, it was an almost fantastic movie like First Contact! Jerry Goldsmith's soundtrack really set the mood for Insurrection. This was the second best TNG movie and the third best Star Trek movie after First Contact and The Undiscovered Country.Congratulations Paramount Pictures!

For the first time ever with a Trek movie, I was bored to death in the theatre. At least in Generations, the second worst film, I could await the much anticipated appearance of Kirk. Insurrection fails, I think, because the storyline lags behind with virtually no action.  The cutsie little attempts at making this movie entertaining with the Next Generation crew is simply terrible---the writers of Star Trek need to think some things through before they depend on Riker's beard-shaving, a navigation joystick, and Data's playing to carry a Star Trek film. In my own opinion, the plot fails because the storyline is not far-reaching enough---most viewers I presume want to see Earth in danger, then the Enterprise (or whatever ship they'll use later) swoops in to save the day. The Star Trek shows that get the worst reviews (V, Gen., Insurrection) were event driven in some remote corner of the galaxy that was virtually unimportant. First Contact, The Undiscovered Country, and the rest create an Armaggeddon of a storyline, then our heros swoop in to save the day.

Insurrection suffers from a double-edged plot line inadequately unfolded in a mere 90 minutes, the lack of a definite lead villain (though I enjoyed Ru'afa, he's no Kahn Noonian Singh), and the absence of a satisfying and fulfilling ending. Insurrection would be the perfect Next Generation flick if it had only posessed these things.Now's the point where I second-guess my own review so far the plotline was not designed for a feature film; it was designed to be used in a series episode, perhaps a two-parter. So Insurrection had that going against it from the start. The Federation-Sona' conspiracy was too complex already to have room for a definitive villain (even General Chang in Undiscovered Country just missed it). And the dramatic elements never built up enough to have the material for a slam-bang ending.Now on to the primary element that made alone Insurrection worth watching... The extended on-location shooting and the human element of slavery and ethics gave the characters a real chance to shine, specifically Picard and Data. In Insurrection, we see Data in the way that we grew to love him; inquisitive, selfless and innocent, the Data who saw things with the wonder of a child, which Tasha Yar once said, makes him more human than any of us.I'm afraid if I said anything about Picard's shining moments, I would give away too much of the plot. Just see it and find out. Suffice it to say that Patrick Stewart did his usual wonderful job throughout the movie. Although his character was the unfortunate victim of a slightly-corny romantic element (that's ALL I'll say hehehe), it is easy to ignore in light of Picard's many shining moments.Some other little tidbits, good and bad- The shuttlecraft chase between Picard, Worf and Data would be worth double the admission EVEN if that was all we saw. Priceless. Absolutely priceless. - How the Tribble did Worf get back there AGAIN?! Geordi starts babbling just when we're about to find out!! Ahhh!!- Worf enters puberty. It's arguable that Worf was just here in Insurrection to be made fun of, but admit Trekkies you LOVED it. -)- We're beginning to see a definite pattern in Jonathan Frakes' directing style - fresh, heroic, and light-hearted even during dramatic moments. I must say I wouldn't mind if he began a directing career.- Paramount needs to lock Jerry Goldmith in a room and only feed him if he contractually agrees to score every Star Trek film for all eternity. Speaking bluntly, no one does it better. (If you need more proof, be reminded that both the Next Generation theme music and the Klingon theme originated with Goldsmith).I believe it to be overall the best of the TNG movies, the greatest reason being that the characters have always been the most interesting part of Roddenberry's original vision, and here we TNG fans, for the first time since the series, really got to see our beloved characters shine.

While the film certainly puts on an entertaining show, I can't help but feel that the plot is banal and full of cliches.  Star Trek Insurrection tries to be one of those hip, rockin' sci-fi films like Independence Day with catchy phrases saddle up, lock and load, but we all heard that a dozen times in the commercials.  To be fair, Star Trek Insurrection revives the old plot where the hero in the white hat comes to town to save some poor widow's farm from cattle rustlers--a warming nostalgia--which gives the movie a kind of good ol' feeling.  The villains are unmistakable in this film although its puzzling that something as liberal as Star Trek employs hired goons who are African-American aliens. And can someone tell me why the a world that is called paradise is only inhabited by Caucasians nonetheless?  Star Trek Insurrection certainly brushes on the displacement of American-Indians with a preachy lecture by the hereo--Captain Picard.  That's Insurrection's greatest problem it tries to be intellectual yet action packed simultaneously.  Consequently, the plot involves a lot of juvenile humor--Aliens with pimples for example--that comes off rather bizarre.  Insurrection is the easiest Star Trek film to understand as charachter development is nil to none, but that's understandable considering the Next Generation series ended six years ago and all personal growth is dead.  What Insurrection does succeed in is positively illuminating sci-fi which, incidentally, is a genre that has been grossly macabre in recent years.  Insurrection is worth watching as entertainment but you won't be musing about it in the shower the next morning.

That is by comparing the Star Trek movies among themselves and not among other mainstream movies. The production, special effects, plot, dialog and acting are well done. Speaking of those who complain about the Insurrection's plot and dialog, I can't wait for the offering of fellow genre series Star Wars I The Phantom Menace;  Let's see, bad guy says, I am here to conquer your solar system, about 10,000 times.  Ruler of planet being attacked responds, I cannot allow you to subjugate my helpless citizens, about 500 times, while Jedi Knights repeat the phrase, May the Force Be With Us, about 9 million times.  Yep, great plot and dialog in those Star Wars movies.  No wonder so many people criticize Star Trek movies. There ARE flaws aplenty  Joy stick navigation, the enemy blown up just in time, Picard inducing Data to sing opera, having to hover over a space-station to Picard aboard.  But I enjoyed the breeziness of the characters interactions and finally some sexual situations! Picard's romance is handled beautifully. Troi is underused but luscious! I am annoyed that Worf, Giordi and Dr. Crusher are ignored. I understand Riker being under used;  Jonathan Frakes has expressed his concern over the difficulty of directing and acting in a pressure cooker environment. In some ways, TNG is becoming more like Classic Trek by concentrating on just Picard and Data.  It's almost as insulting as The Adventures Of 7 Of 9. Jonathan Frakes's direction, independent of the script, is superb.  I think adults will enjoy this movie more than teenagers because it centers more on inter-character banter than explosions. Anyway, Paramount and Jonathan Frakes have announced no more Star Trek movies until after the new Star Wars Trilogy is completed.  Translate that as no more movies since the Trilogy will probably take about 10 years to play out its financial course. Unfortunately, the Star Trek dynasty, which never really translated successfully into the commercial market place of movie theaters is dead.  Sad.

The curse of the odd numbered movies lives on.","Date":"28 February 1999","Score":"","Genre":"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi","Review":"  For me, Insurrection was not a good film. It seems the odd numbered Star Trek films continue to be a let down in comparison to the even numbered films.Insurrection's plot is one of the oldest science-fiction plots in history. That is not a bad thing, but what is bad is the fact that with such a plot, there is an enormous amount of potential, of which Insurrection doesn't follow through on.Even the name Insurrection doesn't fit the context of the film, because Picard and his crew's so-called rebellion isn't against Starfleet or the Federation, but it is against one Admiral, and what the Son'a plan to do to the helpless Ba'ku race.Also, the fact that Picard's actions are so blatantly one-sided that NO ONE in the Federation would ever view his actions as wrong or even controversial, so the Insurrection itself does not exist.The humour in the film was hammered in too hard, so instead of being funny, it was being annoying and forced.The thing that annoyed me the most about this film, especially being a huge Star Trek fan, was the ending. I've read about the original ending, and would've found that more satisfying, even though it wasn't too great either.In First Contact, we had a really great ending, but in Insurrection, we had a Hollywood Safe ending, where Captain Picard is beamed out at the Last Possible Moment. This not only lacked suspense (because there was no doubt that he was going to survive and Ru'afo was going to get blown up real good) but it lacked imagination and thought. It sounded like it was thought up in a few minutes (and seeing as though the original ending was changed, it probably was!)In fact, what annoyed me the most was what the writers did with Data. Michael Piller said that he didn't like the fact that Data had an emotion chip, so he decided to regress his character. Aparently, Data just didn't bring the emotion chip, and spent the entire movie as a socially inept naivete, which is how he was around 5th or 6th season Next Generation. He took such a leap forward and grew so much in First Contact, and in Insurrection, he took about six or seven steps backwards.The plot of finding the fountain of youth was not dealt with well. This discovery has to potential to have massive repercussions throughout the entire Federation, especially since the planet is in THEIR space. However, instead of showing us this, the film gives us ONE representative (Admiral Dougherty, who is in leage with the Son'a), who dies, is not enough. It was a waste of the plot if all it meant was that it would be logged as Another Day At The Office.Furthermore, the Picard romance with Anij was not very good. Anij was a peaceful character and was very slow-paced and tame. Picard has always gone after fresh, vibant women, and now he finds himself in love with this woman who, because she is so at peace with herself, becomes infuriatingly dull and annoying.The scene where she ALMOST died was completely unnecessary, as it added nothing to the plot of the movie.Overall, I was extremely disappointed with Insurrection. I hope that with the Next Generation's next (and probably final) film, they do a better job. They tried to give us a light-hearted story and it came across as ill-conceived and dull. The humour was forced out of the characters, unlike in Star Trek IV The Voyage Home, when it naturally grew out of the characters.Here's hoping for a better STAR TREK X "},{"Title":"Why I ask, Why?","Date":"27 February 1999","Score":"","Genre":"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi","Review":"  Why did they make this movie?

It certainly left us all wanting more, basically because it didn't really end well, but Star Trek isn't exactly famed for its amazing finishes, is it?

Riker loses his beard halfway through &#150; is that a hint that something bad is looming? (1st series STTNG). Anthony Zerbe (Shark-owning bloke in The Living Daylights) is not bad either as the misguided Starfleet Admiral.It was quite clear that Industrial Light and Magic were too busy doing &#145;The Phantom Menace' as there was a new style to the SFX. I thought the space shots were a bit too smooth, except the impressive Riker manoeuvre, which cost slightly more than tugging at the bottom of your tunic. However, the Son'a tagging devices on the Baku planet made up for it.As always, Jerry Goldsmith wrote an excellent musical score which matched the mood of the film throughout. The opening theme was a gentle tune introducing us to the Planet Bak'u over the credits. Much more effective than the usual fanfare over stars nonsense.Once again Crusher hardly features and Brent Spiner is underused.All in all I guess Insurrection was quite good &#150; it dragged on a bit &#150; but in the end it stayed true to the Star Trek tradition and was fun to watch.

The acting was good, it was well-paced, the images were very beautifully conceived, none of the dialogues were rusty, there was a lot of sentiment but it was convincing. Second, it was (I felt) more personal than the usual TNG stuff; I felt as if the characters in the movie stood a fair chance of actually changing. Riker and Picard get to have very pleasing love affairs, which for once, I found beautiful instead of plastic. And for once, their women don't die by the end of the movie. Data actually gets crazy. Worf restarts his puberty... I loved the humour of the film as well.Comparing 'Insurrection' to the other TNG movies I thought 'Generations' was really bad.

The movie contains two different story lines. One concerning (spoilers) an out of control Data. And the second being (Spoilers) the Baku(a new alien race that has just become a member of the Federation)which are trying to acquire a Fountion Of Youth planet from the Sona(a race of people who are related to the Baku, but chose different path in life) with the help of the Federation. The main plot of the film has Picard and his crew committing Insurrection to try and stop the Baku and Federation from stealing the Sona's Planet Of Youth properties with a giant collector. Although this movie is no First Contact(meaning no great space battles or Borg element) it does have its moments. The planet action scenes are great along with the comedy and it does have some space battles with the Baku(which I felt was missing some footage or was just added on at the last minute to the film). So with all that said  I found Insurrection to be more of a family/Trek Fan film rather than a hard core action adventure film like First Contact was.  But by no means is this movie a failure it does deliver some great moments in character development and comedy. 7 out of 10 Stars  "},{"Title":"Nice looking film","Date":"12 December 1998","Score":"","Genre":"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi","Review":"  I've only seen the Star Trek movies from VI on.

Besides, they needed a lighter approach after the dark and grim Star Trek  First Contact (my personal favorite).  Besides, Insurrection has its own fair share of sinister evil in the form of the Son'a and their leader Ru'afo.In all, Star Trek  Insurrection is one of the best Trek films to grace the silver screen, and a nice two-hour escape from the real world.

It lives up to the hype, and delivers, and although this film provides more drama and less action, it doesn't hold back when it counts.The plot is simple, but the underlying ramifications and story will remind you of the classic moral plays that Gene Roddenberry was famous for.  The question  Is it acceptable to relocate a race of beings (in this case only 600 people) to a different world in order to steal the planet's secret to eternal youth?  To Picard and others, the answer is NO, but Starfleet command, particularly Admiral Dougerty think differently.  Picard and crew must violate orders to save these people and fight for the cause of righteousness.All in all, a well done film, even if the story could have been stronger.

Well not to beat around the bush no it doesn't, its a full strike if you ask me.I'm not gonna sugar coat it, gotta be cold here. For me this was easily the weakest Trek film so far, even worse than 'Star Trek V'. I know I have used the term 'outstretched TV episode' a few times in previous reviews with Star Trek but this one term really sums up this film to a tee.Apart from the quite dreadful grey scale shaded tone that accompanies every scene on board the Enterprise which somehow now seems more intrusive than in the previous two films, the plot is utterly non-engaging or even remotely interesting. A planet which harbours immortal regeneration powers that Starfleet and the alien race Son'a wish to keep for themselves whilst at the same time evicting the local hippie population. Say what now?? yes that's right, its basically all about evicting some perfect happy go lucky boring blonde haired blue eyed farm folk off their planet...and that's it. I'm not even sure if there were any bad guys in this! I suppose they were naughty, not really much of a threat though, it was just a few groups fighting amongst themselves really, nothing more.The whole film is so so utterly pointless and dull for virtually the entire run time! It only kicks into action for a small segment near the finale and even that was very mediocre stuff. Everything looks exactly as it does on the TV show, there is nothing that would make you think this is a big budget movie. The effects are no better! you would think they might be getting better but no, this film actually goes a step backwards.There is just something about the next generation design, even though these are movies they just can't seem to shake the look and feel of the TV series. The classic crew movies didn't always look tremendous but they were always much better looking than the original show, they always had real silver screen moments. I'm afraid to say this entry has none what so ever.It seems as though everything is now fully CGI here, I'm not a fan of computer generated effects and I think this is a good example why. The only thing that looks good and realistic in this film are the space panoramas, nebulae, planets etc...which is exactly what CGI is good at. Starships can be done well but here they are no better than their TV counterparts, satisfactory at best. There are still the age old issues of dodgy bluescreen going on but now they also have the added downside of completely fake CGI sequences on top.So apart from the dreadful plot and god awful CGI are there any plus points? I guess F. Murray Abraham does add a sprinkle of class onto the proceedings, its just a shame he does completely nothing of interest for the whole film. The alien race he portrays (Son'a) are such a generic concept with little to no imagination in design, their faces are simply plain grey just like all the uniforms of the Enterprise cre...zzzzz.So the film ticks along with tonnes of dialog including so much space jargon I felt completely bewildered and detached. I'm sure this one film has more Trek technical mumbo jumbo speeches than any other, by the end of the film I had actually lost how or what they were all suppose to be doing.Add to this some really vomit inducing romance with Picard, really hokey sets, really fake plastic looking props, hokey fights and the very annoying practically perfect farm civilisation in their typically 'I'm a goodie' beige/white loose fit garments. Yeah I know its a Star Trek film and you come to expect this kinda stuff but by this point I think certain aspects of this really should be better. The classic Trek crew were loved for their quirky comedic like adventures and Shatner's fluffy fist fights. The next generation crew just can't pull that off, they are too serious and too dull basically. For me they can't get away with the charming nonsense that the classic crew got away with.This film lacks punch and energy, its a complete non entity and in my opinion will only please Trekkies. For fans it basically has all you need as its pretty much a very long TV episode so you can't go wrong. For neutral non-fan folk it will be a slow arduous slog through some heavy dialog that will probably leave you dizzy whilst offering no reward at the end.3/10 "},{"Title":"You can't go home again","Date":"13 December 2014","Score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi","Review":" ***Warning!

The plot attempts to tackle a series of serious ethical and moral challenges that made TNG, in my opinion, the finest example of scfi drama, and of course with Patrick Stewart on board you known the acting is going to be first class. Unfortunately all this is usurped by two fundamental flaws; the script and the action elements.In terms of the script, its fair to say that the writers definitely had a serious off-day. Trek comedy has always been fairly hit and miss, but whoever thought Data asking Worf 'if his boobs were firming up' or that Picard and Worf distracting Data during a mid-air dogfight with Gilbert and Sullivan was comedy gold was clearing smoking something good. There are just so, so many cringeworthy lines in this film, mostly revolving around Data and so many attempts at a cheap laugh. Quite why the writers felt they needed to spice up a story involving forced relocation, genetic manipulation and insubordination with gags such as Worf getting acne and Data inflating into a buoyancy aid is beyond me.If that were all, then the positives of Insurrection, such as the aforementioned engaging plot and strong acting from Stewart would still come to the fore. But sadly its not.The action elements in this film are sadly as lamentable as its script. Again, it's not as if Trek in general is renowned for its action, especially TNG, undoubtedly the most cerebral and least 'old west in space' of the franchise. If you are going to make a film appealing to the philosophical strenghs of TNG then why do you need so many weak phaser fights and running around? Added to that there's a ludicrous ship-to-ship duel in which Riker pilots the Enterprise with....a joystick.Obviously I recognise there needs to be an element of action if the title of the film is 'Insurrection', but surely it could have been done better than this? The sight of a portly Brent Spiner diving around should have stayed on the cutting room floor. Compared with the fight scenes in 'First Contact', well there is no comparison.This review is ultimately very negative, which is a shame because there are some very touching and brilliantly done moments which temporarily make you forget you're watching a bad film, Geordi watching the sunset without his visor or bionic eyes for instance. But surely enough some five minutes later there's another 'Lock and Load' quality line which makes you despair again. And thats a real pity.

However, Star trek 1 the motion picture and especially insurrection, are actually the only 2 films of the 10 which stand out as proper star trek films. Any genre can do action and conventional story lines, but this is exactly what star trek isn't about, despite how popular it has become. All of the other film stories, with the partial exception of star trek generations (hey! another odd numbered film), are set in 'the world of star trek', they are not 'star trek' as gene roddenberry created it they are spin-offs so to speak. Part of Gene Roddenberry's vision seems to have been the explanation and formulation of potential and alternative realities through science, which lead to unscientifically definable conclusions (i.e. fantasy). This combination made star trek unique. Unfortunately, these stories are very hard to create because their is a limit to human imagination and intelligence. Insurrection is an excellent microcosm of many previous star trek TV episodes. The people who call themselves 'fans' don't seem to understand this, and incidentally tend to be the ones who favour the voyager and/or enterprise series' which says something about the latter. Star trek 1 the motion picture is the most 'star trek' film of the lot. Insurrection suffers from what was probably the producer's decision, i.e. that a significant portion of the film be edited out. The initially slow and involving story is in the second half suppressed by favour of slick editing, which increases the action more in line with what star trek has now become; thanks to all those so called fans who have actually destroyed the idea. If insurrection had been allowed to be the slow and deep story it was surely written as (and written very well, the dialogue is fantastic), then it would have been a real trek success. Star trek has now officially died, thanks to 2 reasons that I can see 1) by law of nature anything that becomes popular, loses its true original meaning, and 2) the people with big money and no talent have ruined it. Nevertheless, insurrection remains a good story, true to gene roddenberry's word. Think about it...

Good flick.So anyway, the movie opens up in a serene and peaceful little village. Then we see that Star Fleet is essentially spying on them while wearing suits that make them invisible to all the villagers. Then Data (Spiner) goes berserk and starts running towards the village while being fired at by other Star Fleet officers. Bwa? So he gets the suit off and exposes the Star Fleet spy base to the villagers.Meanwhile, back on the Enterprise, Captain Picard (Stewart) and Commander Riker (Frakes) are busy welcoming a new race into the Federation family. But they also get news that Commander Data has gone berserk on his current mission. Somewhere in there we have a sloppy scene that inserts Worf (Dorn) into the movie. Picard comes out, sees Worf and says, Mr. Worf! What the hell are you doing here? He may as well have responded, Well, I heard they were making another Star Trek movie, so I thought I'd better show up. Sloppy, sloppy character insertion. Whatever, it needed to be done. I mean, a TNG movie with no Worf? What's the point? Anyway, the Enterprise heads off towards the planet where Data has been stationed and conducting research. They hope to offer their assistance in capturing him and/or subduing him, which they do.When they go down to the surface of the planet to investigate and get the hostages back, they find that they really aren't being held against their will. The inhabitants of the planet are very peaceful, very friendly folks who, despite the fact that they appear to have no technological knowledge, do posses quite a bit. They just choose not to use it.When all the folks get back to the Enterprise, they start to realize that everybody is doing a bit better physically. At least the people who were on the planet. Later, when Picard heads down to the surface to investigate further, he finds out that it's because the planet is essentially the fountain of youth, and if you stay there long enough, well, you get better. Picard really oughta hang out for a few years and grow some hair. He'd look great with a mullet.But then we find out what the real purpose is in Star Fleet spying on this planet.

It falls victim to the curse of the computer generated image- the effects, especially on the small screen, don't differ from anything presented on 'Voyager' or 'Enterprise'. I much prefer the physical models floating around in pursuit of each other in 'The Wrath of Khan' than the generic look of the effects in 'Insurrection'- much in the same way I'd rather see Peter Mayhew in a Wookiee costume than a pixel-generated Jar Jar Binks. In addition, there have been many complaints that this is nothing more than an extended episode, and this is somewhat true. The characters and situations don't expand to fill the big screen in the space opera way they did in First Contact, Wrath of Khan, or even Search for Spock. I was thrilled to see this crew upgraded to true movie heroes in FC; here they return a bit to their small-screen roots, probably due to the film's different writer.

From that point on though, the story picks it up quite nicely and the film remains stable throughout. I must admit, that the story is nothing original, but in my opinion, it is at least much more similar to the stories in the Star Trek films featuring Captain Kirk, than it is with those of Generations and First Contact, which partially did the trick for me as there were more things to think about, maybe even a deeper meaning.Despite the fact that this film has some entertaining value, there is nothing great about this film and I still feel that the new Generation does not measure up to the &#145;old' one.

The effect is then ruined when Riker takes control of the ship using what appears to be a joystick from an 80s Atari console.I must say that while I enjoyed the movie, as I still enjoy the whole premise and idealism of Star Trek in general, it's poor plot and credibility prevent it from making it a worthy addition to the films that precede it. The issues of the plot were far too minor and it failed to excite, with weak turns by the NG cast not helping matters.6/10 "},{"Title":"Not bad, but not a patch on ST6","Date":"10 August 2003","Score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi","Review":"  Not a bad movie, in fact it's one  of my favourite movies of all all ten trek movies.

After catching up and reacquainting ourselves with the crew, it's off to deep space and some minor-league territorial disputes that involve the cliched issue of the Prime Directive, immortality, dual cultures at odds with each other and, of course, Data's search for humanity.Hiding behind the bad guy makeup this time is F. Murray Abraham as skin-peeling Adhar Ru'afowho is ineffective on his own in the same way any other Next Gen villain is due to limitations of screen time and any real sense of danger.The problem with this episode is that it resigns to telling small stories on a big screen and assuming fans or neutral moviegoers will accept something that wouldn't have been greenlit as a film without the Star Trek logo. But since the props were in the closet and wardrobe still warm from the dryers across the lot on Voyager, it was cheap and easy to shell out another episode for the built-in audience, tie it into marketing millions in merchandise, cash a fat check and add another lame, inept story to the increasing library of Star Trek videos.At this rate, Star Trek X could be about the peril confronted when an Enterprise toilet malfunctions, so long as we stop every ten minutes to find out what color hair Dr. Crusher has this time out, hear Worf growl, and give Data ten minutes to explain that he's a puppet without strings dreaming of being a real boy.  It would still make money.  Fans would complain, but they'd still shell out the money for the new insignia patches, the new uniform patterns, soundtracks, action figures and not care a graceful Gideon's damn about the simple fact that there is no longer anything vaguely resembling an adventure story in the Star Trek universe outside the novels.Better scripts are written for ensemble casts of comparable size while incorporating moral and philosophical ideas that seem to make Trek unique in its genre.  I wonder if it's time to look outside the Trek ranch for new ideas and influence to revitalize the franchise.

At this point Star Trek Voyager was doing worse in the ratings and generally considered to not be up with the original two series' and Deep Space Nine was about to go off the air.  With Star Trek on TV looking to falter, as the empire has many times before they turned to a movie.  This movie is just not up to par, and the entire Star Trek genre appeared to be in a spiral.Not that this is a bad movie but as a Star Trek movie this is not very good.  The one thing that stands out in this movie is the special effects.  What little opportunity there is to have special effects they are very good.  It shows people worked a lot on special effects for this movie.The problem with this movie is that there is no grand plot.  The plot looks more like an episode of Star Trek than a big budget movie that is suppose to have all kinds of action thrills, suspense and the like.  The plot is about the fountain of youth, not in Florida as Ponce De Leon thought but on a completely different planet.  There are people on a planet that do not age. Of course there is a plot involved to get rid of the inhabitants of this fountain of youth by a group that is not from the planet.  And Starfleet backs this group.  Captain Picard Realizes that this is against the prime Directive so he decides to rebel against the government, an &#145;Insurrection,' hence the title.There are no great battles, no intrigue the whole affair is really mundane.  The plot is relatively predictable and the writing is not bad in this movie it is just unexciting and uninspiring.  There are no gaping plotholes in the movie but there really is not in any Star Trek movies (except for Star Trek Generations.)  With the plot the movie tries to say something significant about convictions and going against the establishment if you know in your heart of hearts you are right despite the fact authority might be wrong.  Again the message really does not matter in this movie because overall the movie is boring.I can say with confidence this is perhaps the least entertaining Star Trek movie.  It is good but it is not a Star Trek 6 or First Contact.  It is nice to watch only if you are watching a Star Trek marathon.  The most notable thing about the movie is the role of F. Murray Abraham as the head bad guy.  He does a good job in a role that should have had much more depth and purpose.

It's an utterly generic entry into a market saturated with so many more of its ilk that it probably would have flopped if not for the Star Trek name. When we go to see a movie with the word Insurrection in the title, one expects something a bit bigger than a minor skirmish in some obscure blood feud.The worst part it, the film panders to the lowest common denominator for the sake of cheap laughs, some of which are painful to watch. Trek comedy has worked in the past when the humor was a natural outgrowth of the characters and situations. If you don't believe me just catch the original series episode The Trouble With Tribbes, long regarded as one of the highlights of the franchise.Technically, this is the most polished entry in the series. With some fine special effects, set design, and photography, the film always looks great. However, it's just a glossy, empty package.It's pretty well-performed given the circumstances. All the series regulars fall comfortably into their old roles. F. Murray Abraham makes an okay villian, but he can't match Ricardo Montalban in Star Trek II The Wrath of Khan.

From start to finish it works well.I really enjoy the start of the movie, seeing Data go wild and expose the Federation Observation Station spying on the agrarian and peaceful Ba'Ku.  From there we go off to the Enterprise where a ceremony to welcome a new race to the Federation is taking place, and Crusher is berating Picard for having a fatter neck than he used to.  I really enjoy the sense of camaraderie that seems to have built up among these characters over the years, and this is really the first time we've seen it played out on screen.  I also like the references to the Federation's losses to the Borg and the Dominion, making it feel as though these really are dangerous times for the Federation and it's Starfleet.As the movie progresses, the storytelling becomes more whimsical, with the peaceful Ba'Ku being juxtaposed with the aggressive and warlike Son'a.  The scenes that take place on the planet have just the right feel to them, and you can see where the money went, the Ba'Ku village sets look fantastic, although I must say that the Son'a ship sets are diabolical.I'd say that Insurrection is definitely the best of the odd-numbered Trek films, and that the supposed 'curse' may even have been broken.

It tries to be many things at once Funny, action-packed, and thought-provoking.  Unfortunately, it falls short in each of these goals.First time I saw this movie was in the theaters.  I disliked it.  I rented it on DVD a year later --- thinking I might enjoy it more on the second viewing.  I was wrong.  I was so bored, I turned it off near the end during the climax of the story.  And I'm supposed to be the big Startrek fan who has seen all the other Startrek movies at least twice.The movie falls flat in just about every way.  Humor is very forced, unnatural, and unfunny.  Very childish --- from Worf's Big Pimple, to a Video Game Joystick at the ship's helm, to Riker throwing paper balls at an unsuspecting Troi.  When I saw this movie at the theater, the packed audience was deathly silent through these unfunny gags.  Painfully silent.The film tries hard to be thought-provoking.  Incessant (not-so-subtle) attempts to make us cherish each moment, carpe diem, and all that stuff. The film goes as far as actually *lecturing* us several times.  Anji & Picard have several (looooong) monologues.  The writers of the script don't realize that good movies should *show* us these philosphies, not *lecture* us about it.To me, this film ranks with Startrek V as the worst in the Startrek franchise.  The people who like this film do so only because of the words Star Trek are attached to Insurrection.  I enjoyed the other imperfect Startrek movies (STMotion Picture, ST3, STGenerations) because they had several memorable scenes.  Insurrection doesn't have a single memorable moment.

Still, it is not a mindless shoot em up which most sci-fi movies are these days, so overall I enjoyed it.Like all Star Trek movies Insurrection has a convoluted plot that involves various pseudo scientific details and Star Trek concepts and in jokes. Meaning, it helps to have seen the TV shows to better understand what is going on. This is probably the main obstacle to why Star Trek movies have never been blockbusters. Now about the plot. This may be a spoiler so, you have been warned. The basis of the film is greed and robbery. The Ba'ku who live on a beautiful planet are a defenseless culture who have something valuable, a special form of energy called metaphasic energy which reverses aging. The bad guys, the Son'a, want to kill the Ba'ku for it. The Federation proposes a forced evacuation of the Ba'ku so the Federation can share this valuable thing with the Son'a. Captain Picard insists on a compromise that would allow the Ba'ku to continue their life on their planet and for the Son'a and the Federation in cooperation with the Ba'ku to use the metaphasic energy of for an anti-aging treatment.You might have been confused by that paragraph but being a Star Trek fan this was pretty routine. Insurrection is about a Star Trek idea called the prime directive which means the Federation is not supposed to interfere with the cultures of other planets. Is this interesting enough to be a good movie? It could have been if presented in a more clear and unusual way.   Besides the complicated plot, the main problem with Insurrection is that the Ba'ku are pretty boring. They look like people from California living in a hippie commune. If you compare this to the planet Tatooine in Star Wars you can see that the Ba'ku planet could have been more exciting. Another problem is the typical love affair between the Star Trek captain and one of the cute aliens. A pretty worn out plot twist.So, why did I like Insurrection? There was a lot of humor in the film that I enjoyed. The special effects were alright. But the main reason I thought Insurrection was fun was because I kept my expectations low (repeat after me, this is not Star Wars) and I was open to sci-fi that has some thought behind it.

I don't think Frakes would direct as bad as Razzie Award winning Shatner. Added to the fact that Star Trek movies don't have to be about saving Earth or the galaxy from Armageddon each time. And they didn't have time travel, which has been overused in Trek.Now the film did have  a few bad sides to it - the mild use of technobabble. We don't need to hear extreme flux, isolitic, inertial dampers, coupling, blah-blah-blah. This has made the recent Treks, especially Voyager, suffer. At least it wasn't used for solutions.

Oh, yeah, he's breaking some kind of rule -- the problem is, the authority he was rebelling against seemed so distant and unimportant, it was easy to forget that there was any other dimension to the story than the shooting and hide-and-seek between the heroes and the bad guys.  The whole plot was boring and uninvolving, probably because the pastoral Ba'ku who need protection are unbelievable even in a science fiction movie.  A race of hippy immortals who know all about advanced science, but choose not to use it; do we know anyone who prefers to haul their water by hand and lug it to the house if a better method is available? Anything more advanced, it seems, would be corrupting, but they are willing to accept the help of the more advanced weapons Picard and his crew are equipped with when push comes to shove.  The romance between Anij and Picard was merely exasperating; perhaps they thought this movie would be daring and original by showing the captain falling for a mature woman instead of the usual twenty-something who sets her cap for him, but Anij overdoes the Earth-mother bit.  It's hard to believe Picard could have anything to say to this po-faced bore; when they settle down in a glen for her to teach him about slowing down time, I searched in vain for the standard incense sticks and windchimes.  Oh, but I forgot - she's brilliant, too.First Contact was genuinely exciting and engaging; several times during that movie I caught myself wondering how on earth are they going to escape?

Wisely, they resisted this temptation and in the process have delivered a film that doesn't take itself too seriously, which makes for a good thing. I've seen too many sci-fi films attempt to take themselves way too seriously, and as a result, they tend to become bogged down with their own self-importance. These films should take a leaf out of Insurrection's book, because by taking a different approach than normal, we are treated to a thoroughly entertaining two-hour adventure.After 100+ episodes and 2 feature films the crew know their characters like the back of their hands, but they still find the odd occasion to show a different side to what we expect from them - largely due to the plot, which concerns eternal youth. Jonathan Frakes manages to make this the most humorous Trek film yet, and just when you think a scene is becoming boring, he injects some humour and action to move up the tempo. Indeed, most of the highlights come in the more comical scenes; from the opening look at Picard's overly serious approach to things, to Riker's attempts at scoring with Troi - he even manages to lose his beard at one point.Insurrection was never going to be original, but gladly it never becomes boring, something which Generations managed to be. A change of pace is a good thing, and Star Trek manages to be enjoyable for mainstream audiences and for long time Trekkers, who will appreciate the winks and in-jokes that non-trekkers will probably miss.7/10.

When it slips from his grasp, he develops an overwhelming obsession to reclaim it, and becomes a mad alien scientist. An expensive piece of federation hardware breaks less than a week after coming online, leaving everyone very embarrassed. Meanwhile during a formal ceremony on board the Enterprise (which involves dressing up) Captain Picard is interrupted by a disturbing subspace message from starfleet concerning some one very close to him. Picard, Worf & Data sing a raucous song connected with the sea.This is all related to the mad alien scientist's scheme (involving a large cloaked secret device) to regain access to the localised anomalous wotzit, and thereby regain access to eternal life. To aid him in this quest, he is conspiring with a rebel faction of one of the Star Trek super-powers, who has supplied a cloaked ship. In regaining access to the localised anomalous wotzit, the mad alien scientist is willing to sacrifice the (relatively small) pre-industrial population of a nearby planet. Picard finds out about this, nearly falls under the spell of the localised anomalous wotzit and decides to stop the mad alien scientist.One of Picard's crew loses a handicap that he has had since the start of TNG, but this is just used as an excuse for bad puns. Picard beams down to the rocky planet (which resembles the northern United States) while Riker commands the Enterprise in battle (very badly) against a vastly inferior craft that is, in fact, cheating. The confrontation ends in the explosion of the Enterprise's warp core. Eventually, the mad alien scientist powers up a large electric thingamajig to exploit the anomalous immortality wotzit, which will (inexplicably) destroy the pre-industrial civilisation. Picard beams over to a big metal gantry on which the controls for the electric thingamajig are mounted, for the final one-on-one battle to the death with the mad alien scientist. I can't tell you how it ends, because I fell asleep, in spite of the very expensive CGI; and the last time I did that was while watching Batman & Robin.If this sounds like a review of Star Trek Generations, it's not. Given that the plot and excess of technobabble in that particular film were it's most criticised aspects, it's strange to see them recycled wholesale here. And it's not just these things that seem unoriginal. Picard falls in love (again), Data indulges in his obsession with small boys (again) and Picard makes lots of long, boring speeches about the Prime directive (are you seeing a recurring theme here?).Anthony Zerbe as Admiral Doughoty stands out for special mention, for failing to react to anything that happens in any way whatsoever. Not since Barbara Bain in Space1999 has a SF character seemed so completely disinterested or without motivation.Insurrection sums up Gene Rodenberry's vision of Star Trek perfectly. We have here a future world where there is no war, no hunger, no poverty and in which people have evolved to a point where they are concerned only with becoming bettering themselves, spiritually and intellectually. Excuse me, but where's the fun in that? Real Science Fiction has giant wasps in it.And one last bitch why is Worf in this picture, aside from contractual obligations? No mention of his relationship with Troi, no mention of Jadzia, not even an explanation as to why he is on the Enterprise. If he had turned up in the Defiant to aid Picard, as Sulu did in the Undiscovered Country, it would have made much more sense.

Frankly, I was afraid that Insurrection would be a horrible movie. The image that sticks out in my mind as epitomizing the unevenness of those first 20 minutes is the irritating at best and embarrassing at worst head shot of that female Starfleet officer repeatedly screaming Data! Stand down! Thank you, Jonathan Frakes. Not only did it make a longtime Star Trek fan like myself cringe, but I also feared that it did everything to reinforce the perception of non-fans that Star Trek is nothing but people in funny suits barking orders at each other, which, of course, is not the case. I also didn't like the first few minutes the movie spent on the Enterprise during the reception for that new alien race. While I was glad they didn't even attempt to explain away Worf's presence on the ship (I just didn't care how he got there as long as he was there), it just seemed as if Patrick Stewart and his supporting cast were going through the motions.However, once the movie progresses to the point where Picard and Worf go to save Data, it slides into an amazing groove which it rides to its conclusion. The H.M.S. Pinafore bit was very funny, and while it may not have made a lot of sense, it didn't really matter, as Insurrection seems to be all about downplaying the means to reach the ends, which are often very entertaining. Picard's relationship with the Bak'u, the exodus from the village, and the journey to safety are all done very well, with many humorous moments and many toughing ones thrown in. I felt Picard's romance with the Bak'u leader carried much weight and was very well done; it was more resonant than the only other comparable relationship in the Star Trek films, which was between William Shatner and the marine biologist in The Voyage Home. Their relationship was pulled off so well that the sequence at the end of the film when Picard says that he has shore leave coming up and that he's going to spend it there is not empty in the slightest. I enjoyed the mysticism surrounding the planet's fountain-of-youth type qualities; I expected the scenes where time stood still to come off as hollow, but, to my surprise, I found myself instilled with a sense of wonder, which is a credit to the filmmakers. I also enjoyed the Riker scenes, and I felt they were some of the best Riker in command scenes since The Best of Both Worlds II, if not the best scenes. As for the manual steering column that some have mentioned (disparagingly), I felt it was more of a joke than an action sequence device used by the writers. Hey, I laughed.Aside from the first 20 minutes, the things I didn't like about the film were, 1) The lack of Gates McFadden. I felt sorry for her throughout the film that her character has been relegated to such a bit part, and I hope she gets a bigger role (or at least some good moments) in the next film. 2) The under-usage of F. Murray Abraham. Abraham is a wonderful talent, and he is under-used here (perhaps his portrayal of Salieri in Amadeus raised my expectations to an unfair level). He had the potential to be the most interesting Star Trek movie villain yet and the most alien villain yet. It's not as if he was used as a conventional villain; on the contrary, he was most unconventional (except in perhaps the climax). I just wanted to see more of him and I wanted more of the interest he instilled in me when I viewed him. 3) The exploration of the fact that the Son'a and the Bak'u were once one people. In a film that is designed to entertain, this kind of thing is perhaps the greatest casualty. Instead of exploring the insane desire for revenge Ru'afo has or the extreme regret and wanting-to-go-home-again type of feeling of his first-officer guy (and perhaps some of the other Son'a), the fact that the Son'a and Bak'u are genetically the same is cast aside, save until the end when the Son'a guy who helps Picard (the first officer) is reunited with his family. If they had more of that kind of thing, the film would have carried more emotional resonance.In the end, while I think First Contact was a better movie, the sheer entertainment value of Insurrection is greater. I would recommend it to all Star Trek fans and to non-fans who are curious, who feel brave, or who are relegated to seeing it due to the lack of anything better at the theater. Don't worry if you are of the latter, you'll laugh - just disregard the first 20 minutes.

Featuring the cast of Star Trek The Next Generation (1987-94) in their second solo feature film, this ninth entry into the three-decade sci-fi franchise leisurely bounces along, concerned with little more than giving some old characters a fresh, comfortable makeover.The story, concerning an intergalactic struggle over a planet with rings that contain fountain of youth properties, goes down as easy as a glass of lemonade in the summer. It's truly delightful to watch Patrick Stewart dive into Captain Jean-Luc Picard with unusual relish, and although the supporting characters' screen time is frustratingly low (just how many lines did Dr. Crusher have?), they're all in fine form.  Everyone on screen is clearly having a great time, and not trying to turn this relatively ineffectual little outdoor adventure into a space opera.One wonders, however, just how much those behind the scenes cared about the project.  While Jonathan Frakes's direction comes and goes (in many moments, he's on the mark, although his staging of the final confrontation between Picard and Son'a leader F. Murray Abraham - merely nibbling on the scenery), other production values are unbelievably low-grade.  Herman Zimmerman's sets look like they were cobbled together from the leftovers of Star Trek Voyager (and they probably were!), and the visual effects, for the first time in nearly a decade of Star Trek films not by Industrial Light & Magic, are blindingly sub-par (When will Hollywood learn that computer generated images ARE NOT YET ABLE to replace traditional visual effects processes!!).There's a pleasant Jerry Goldsmith score, however, with a theme for the peaceful Bak'u that will haunt memory long after the end credits have finished their roll.  And for the most part, however, Star Trek Insurrection does little to push the franchise in a new direction.  But when the results are this much fun, who wants a push?

I might even consider seeing it again, and it will definitely be a DVD in my collection.I gave the movie a 7 out of 10 because of three problems I found with it. 1.  Way too much technobabble.  Too often, now, Star Trek resolves its problems by coming up with some new technobabble to throw at it.  2.  The Enterprise is treated in the same way that most movies treat 1982 Ford sedans--just fodder for the car chase scenes.  A long time ago, the Enterprise used to be a character on Star Trek.  When the Enterprise died in Star Trek 3, I cried.  When the Enterprise was near destruction in First Contact and Insurrection, I shrugged it off.  3.  Who on earth came up with the Manual Steering Column?!?!  This had to be the most incredibly stupid thing I have ever seen in a Star Trek movie.  Luckily, it was only there for a second (making me ask again why it was needed), so it didn't grate me like other stupid ideas (like Star Trek 5's elevator shaft)...All that being said, I felt that those issues were minor in comparison to how much fun the movie was.  I'd say it broke the odd number curse, but I never believed in such a thing, since I felt that ST8 was trash, and ST1 and 3 were some of the best films ever made.

It did have one interesting twist at the end, but nothing that came close to the ingenious surprises in First Contact.  The movie was constantly having to go to obvious measures to explain itself, and this points to an effort to salvage a hastily written script.  The character development was almost non-existent, including that of the character with which Picard was supposed to be having a romantic relationship.  It is just as well that the evidence of this relationship was also virtually non-existent, because this would have seemed terribly shallow given that we knew next to nothing about this person.  Even the battle scenes, or what semblance of battle scenes there were, relied extensively and repeatedly on a single device the tactical use of the transporter.  The plot developments made such extensive use of this that the movie might instead have been called Textbook examples of the use of the teleporter in tactical situations, as an addendum to a Starfleet manual.

The writing, however, left a lot to be desired.  First, the basic plot is vintage Star Trek from the original series, and the crew's idealism seemed to lack a roughness at the edge that seemed to be mandatory in our more cynical age.  Second, there had been too little character development besides Picard and Data.  Riker seemed to have too little screen time compared with the television series.

By far better than Generations but not as good as First Contact.  I had a tough time understanding some of the parts and what was going on but that is just me. The beginning is somewhat humorous with Data going nuts and Worf and Picard trying to get him back.  The whole story is about the Bak'tu and their homeworld.  They have technology but just don't want to use it.  Their world is a fountain of youth because their cells are being regenerated all the time.  Starfleet, under the direction of their Admiral, is trying to get the Bak'tu off the planet, until the Enterprise finds out.  In one of the greatest scenes ever in a Star Trek film Picard takes off his rank buttons one by one.  This of course to symbolize that he is going against the Federation in an attempt to save the Bak'tu.  I loved seeing this because for the first time Picard turned into Kirk and did not use the diplomatic approach.  After some interesting moves and some space fights the Enterprise, of course, prevails and the Bak'tu are allowed their civilization for eternity.  Patrick Stewart gives another Oscar worthy performance, as always, that really shows he was meant to be Picard.  Brent Spiner (Data), Michael Dorn (Worf), and LaVar Burton (LaForge) are the other main ingredients in the film and offer great performances with Spiner shining as usual in his comic scenes.  The minor characters in this one being Jonathon Frakes (Riker), Gates McFadden (Crusher), and Marina Sirtis (Troi) also do a fine job with Frakes showing that Riker really deserves the captain's chair.  As for Frakes's second try at directing a Star Trek film he does a very nice job.  The special effects are extraordinary and a sight to see.  He deserves the next film as well.  Frakes as proved himself a good director and a good actor.  The only main problem I had with the entire film was some of the jokes.  Some were amazing and as good as some comedies get, while some were just uncalled for and useless.  They attempted to turn the film into another Star Trek 4 and failed at doing that.

Unfortunately, that playfulness was taken to far and went into the silliness, and a couple times into the cheesiness range.  The character of Anij I felt was played so low-key, that I couldn't decide whether she was going for that wizened feel, or whether the character was supposed to be half-asleep.  It is true that Data is back to the Pinocchio type character in this picture, which is kind of cool, though odd considering his character's developments in the last two pictures. The story, dealing with life, youth, etc. was interesting, but I found that to be the McGuffin.  I ended up not caring about that, and waiting for the next funny line or cool effect to pop up on the screen.  The Bak'u are cool, though gratuitously gross; at least they have a passion driving them.  The Starfleet villain didn't really do it for me.  The acting was very fine indeed, but the whole principles of the character and of the whole Federation I didn't quite buy into. I felt that the demise of a certain bad guy really stretched the limits of how much suspension of disbelief we are willing to engage in.

Nimoy used trans-cultural situations to bring his comedy across within the context of a mission that had social impact on both the world of Star Trek, and in our own 20th Century.  The message of saving the whales in that film was not only important to the Earth of Captain Kirk's time, but also stands as an important message to us, in OUR time.  Shatner's directorial debut in Star Trek V attempted to travel the same road, with dismal results.  Star Trek became, in that film, a hokey romp of camp humor that was a black eye to all that Star Trek had stood for.  Beyond the multi-colored uniforms and often unintentionally humorous dialog, Star Trek had always presented itself not as science fiction, but as a future to our race that was not only quite possible, but also quite plausible.Director Frakes, following the huge success of First Contact in his debut, seems to fall into the same trap that ruined Shatner's Final Frontier nine years earlier.  Insurrection's obvious comedy-driven plot is laced with one-liners and gag situations, to the point that the underlying story suffers from it.  Like Final Frontier, the story of the So'na and the B'aku could have been a compelling philosophical masterpiece relevant to the Saxons' relocation of Native Americans upon claiming North America as their own.  Instead, what we get is a jumbled message behind the humor that is difficult to identify with.  Even the often stoic and typically reserved Picard is unfortunately also drawn into this mess, delivering quips from the onset of the film that immediately set the tone.  As for action, so muddled by humor, there is little that in truly entertaining.  The Enterprise, for example, while never intended as the center of any Star Trek story, is hardly present, and is depicted not as the rough and tumble battleship of First Contact, but as an actually rather weak vessel that must resort to trickery to defeat enemies never established as superior.All in all, Insurrection begins with an uncomfortable first act established by Picard's sudden and inexplicable change of persona, during which familiar characters act as they never had before, followed by a second act that is an improvement but never compelling.  The finale is ultimately weak compared to other Trek triumphs of the past, contriving a way to put a principal cast member in grave danger when a more obvious solution would seem more suitable.Star Trek needs to lose the bug of catch phrases established by Nick Meyer in Star Trek VI (Nimoy's Go to hell.), and return to the original vision, which was that of a Wagon Train to the Stars.  Even while the Enterprise was shooting them up in The Wrath of Khan, there was still an underlying philosophical principal, and at least there was a lot of excitement. Insurrection is not as bad as Final Frontier, but perhaps it's time to refuel the Dilithium Crystals and get this ship back on course.** (Below Average) "},{"Title":"Comments on Star Trek Insurrection","Date":"11 December 1998","Score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi","Review":"  A warm, semi-spiritual, yet all too predictable installment of the ST series, Insurrection introduces several intriguing ideas that are never fully explained or explored.

Here is my numerical reasoning.Insurrection (9th) and First Contact (8th) was directed by Jonathan Frakes (who also plays as the first officer in command Cmd. William Riker).If you divide 9 by 3 you get 3rd installment Search for Spock and divide 8 by 2 you get 4th installment Voyage Home.Both 3rd and 4th installment was directed by Leonard Nimoy (1st officer in command, Cmdr. Spock).Voyage Home (ST IV) was commerically and critically successful.First Contact (ST 8) was also commerically and critically successful.ST 3 Search for Spock is a nice movie compared to ST 5 and ST 1.It had good visual effects, and continues off ST 2. I personally liked ST 3 and am waiting for its DVD release.Given that, I have a feeling that ST 9 Insurrection would do well with both Critics and box office. I am sure Frakes realized that this is an odd number and decide to take the director's helm.

And written wholly by Berman and Pillar, no Ron D Moore, no Brannon Braga involved to make argumentative and conflicting (And most important, Canon- Breaking) scenes.This story takes place while The Federation is involved in The Dominion War, shortly after Jadzia Dax had been brutally murdered at the hands of a Kosst Amogen infected Gul Dukat. The Sisko was back On Earth recovering, and Kira Neres had been elevated to Colonel in the Bajoran Militia. So this is a brief pause in Hostilities where Starfleet is recollecting its assets. Starfleet needs Allies, even if they are newly Warp-Capable races, like the short reptilian species Picard must teach how to dance. In this way, it reflects Lord of The Rings, The Two Towers, there will be more about that.Data is on an idyllic planet where he is involved in a secret Starfleet/Son'a alliance, there is a hidden Duckblind overlooking a Baku Village, similar to the one that malfunctioned on Mintaka III in The Next Generation.But only this time, Data apparently Malfucntions and Picard is called to send an Admiral Dougherty (Anthony Zerbe) Data's Schematics. He orders Picard to stay put, but it's DATA and he has to go.When Picard gets to The Briar Patch, he is accosted by Dougherty and a Son'a named Gal'Na/Ru'Afo* (The guy who killed Mozart, F. Murray Abraham). They both want Picard to leave asap, but when Picard and Worf (Who has been visiting from Deep Space Nine, after his wife Jadzia had been killed) use a Runabout-Style Shuttle to chase him down and capture him, Geordi sees right away that Data's damage was caused by a Son'a Disruptor - So Data's Ethical Program had kicked in, and was following Starfleet Procedure.A Huge conspiracy is unraveled involving a forced relocation of The Baku and a huge Cloaked Holodeck Ship - but Dougherty IS Starfleet, and Picard has to form an Insurrection to keep Starfleet's Principles.Not to mention, Geordi's Eyes grow back, Riker shaves his beard, and Worf grows a Huge GORCH on his nose. Had Worf squeezed it, it would have covered Picard's head with Klingon Goo, Klingons never do anything small. Picard visits a Baku Woman he likes, Anij (a very handsome Donna Murphy) revealing she is over 300 years old. So these people are on a Magic Planet that can make old people young and the Son'a and Dougherty both want to develop it's resources which is a political way of saying they want to steal the planet's magic particles.Picard gathers most of the Bridge Crew for a midnight flight in the Captain's Yacht while Riker and Geordi go to have a discussion with Starfleet about that is happening here.So they gather the Baku Villagers, and in a Scene from The Two Towers, they collect their belongings and head to a Baku version of Helms Deep - A rock fortress of Kelbonite and Fistrium that will prevent Gal'Na from beaming them off the planet so they can irradiate it.Mark Deakins is Tournel - A Villager who stands on the rooftops and shouts out words we heard in Two Towers Do not take any treasures, Take only what you need... and The Baku with Picard make their long pilgrimage to the Kelbonite Hills with Wargs and Son'a on either side. Compare this to The Two Towers when Háma (John Leigh) says practically the same thing to the Villagers in Edoras.This is probably the Longest and most Complex Trek film of the whole 20 year run of Films, except for the First Trek Motion Picture Directors Cut at 2 hours, or the two new Reboot offering which are close to 2 hours each. This one is 143 and not one idle minute.Picard/Gandalf has to ensure the safety of The Baku, even if he is to be killed in doing so, which comes very close to almost happening. and there is a secret relationship between the Son'a and The Baku which is a revelation and a Macguffin at the same time.This one took repeated viewings until I finally admitted It is one of the best Next Generation movies.*It will be seen later in the movie how Ru'Afo has two names.

"},{"Title":"No lasting value","Date":"3 April 2011","Score":"2 out of 4 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi","Review":" I was actually led to a book written by Michael Piller about the process of writing the screenplay for 'Insurrection', in a kind of internet garden-path approach which began with Harry S. Plinckett's review of 'Insurrection'.From watching the Plinckett review of 'Insurrection', one gets the idea that 'Insurrection' was written in a single afternoon by someone with little writing credential. For this reason I have found 'Fade In' a fascinating read, though partly in that kind of perverse sense in which you might watch the supplemental material included on a DVD of a movie you didn't enjoy--commentaries, Making Of featurettes, etc. Who was behind this; what went wrong; why did they spend all this time and money on such a mediocre film? I was surprised to learn that the screen writer, Michael Piller, is actually a veteran screenwriter (at least on television) where he wrote many classic STTNG episodes. It appears that he was much more restrained here than he ever was for a TV episode. The screenplay went through hundreds of drafts and tweaks, including significant executive meddling given the comparatively higher investment for a movie. It does seem as though the movie would have been better if he'd been granted greater creative control.There were also some budgetary restraints, which sometimes dictated the story elements. However, I wouldn't say that these justify the story here being sub-par. 'Serenity' was made on a smaller budget and is still a much better sci-fi movie.After watching the Plinckett review, the sheer number of glaring plot holes in 'Insurrection' does call into question whether Piller really knew what he was doing. I noticed that many of Plinckett's criticisms were actually the very same concerns that had been raised while the script was still being written. Paramount raised all of the following questions- How is the Baku race just 600 people, do they have children, and why haven't they died off from inbreeding? (question from Paramount executives)- Why is Starfleet bending to the demands of weird aliens, why are the aliens employing the help of Starfleet? They appear to possess much advanced technology. The Enterprise was poorly matched against their fleet. They probably could have deployed the Collector without ever having gotten Starfleet involved or even registered on Starfleet's radar they indicated that this was a fairly out-of-the-way planet, and it was surrounded in some kind of sensor-jamming ion storm.It seems from 'Fade In' that Piller wanted to write 'Insurrection' as a short, sweet Picard story, with themes of love, regrowth, rejuvenation, old & young. But at each step, he was thwarted by executives who told him that he needed less dialogue, faster pacing, more action, cool weapons, and a big space battle involving a large explosion. Many viewers, including Plickett, complained about how Picard's behavior veers widely from TV Picard; however, Piller had intended this precise change in Picard's outlook on life to be the film's primary arc, his hero's journey as Piller stated it. Earlier versions of the screenplay devoted much dialogue to establishing this change in Picard; however, Piller was forced to minimize this dialogue and much of what *was* filmed of these scenes was later cut. I think that Piller was trying to veer the film into a character-building direction, while everyone else involved was trying to veer it into a big-dumb-action-movie direction, and so the tone of the resultant product is very confused because Piller essentially just can't really write film-grade action.Overall a very dull effort, with nothing of lasting value to Star Trek. Aesthetically, both new alien races are duller than dull, with the Baku not even possessing a single distinctive non-human trait. Their clothing and village set pieces show zero creative effort. Although this was intended as a spiritual companion to The Search For Spock and The Journey Home, people will continue to discuss the latter two movies for decades to come; nothing in 'Insurrection' has similar lasting value.

Nevertheless, the ninth entry in the long-lived but prosperous space odysseys of Captain Jean-Luc Picard and the crew of the Starship Enterprise still has what it takes to boldly go. Director Jonathan Frakes, who helmed First Contact, shifts the emphasis away from the usual swashbuckling heroics in this otherwise predictable but entertaining installment. Instead, Frakes focuses on the camaraderie among the Enterprise crew. Character dominates action in Insurrection. Although younger Star Trek fans may complain about the scarcity of photon torpedo dogfights, the old guard will applaud Insurrection because the entire crew rather than Picard alone influences the outcome. The Rick Berman & Michael Piller scenario has the Enterprise thwarting the forced relocation of 600 helpless colonists from their Eden-like planet whose properties make it a fountain of youth. Picard (Patrick Stewart) and crew find themselves drawn into an interstellar blood feud when android Cmdr. Data (Brent Spiner) runs amok while participating in a Federation mission on the Shangri-La home planet of a gentle people called the Ba'ku. The Ba'ku live simple, uncomplicated lives comparable to the Quakers and the Amish. Shunning technology, these self-sufficient folks grow their own food and produce by hand their own clothes, tools, and art. According to the Ba'ku, when you create a machine to do a Manos work, you take something away from the man. Over 300 years have passed since the Ba'ku encamped on this unique planet in an unstable quadrant of space designated 'the Briar Patch.' Moreover, this Caucasian race of humans has weathered the ravages of centuries. The 'metaphasic radiation' emanating from the planet's rings has given them perpetual youth. Meanwhile, suffering a dire reversal of fortune, the Federation has grown weak. The Borg and other enemy aliens have taken their toll, and the Federation has formed an uneasy alliance with the Son'a, a dying but technologically advanced race of fascists who dress like a cross-between of the Mummy and Marvel Comics' Dr. Strange. You know the Son'a are the bad guys the moment you see them because they look hideous. The Son'a endure constant face-lifts, like the cosmetic surgery in the Terry Gilliam movie Brazil, because they cannot keep their wrinkled and rotting skins wrapped tightly enough. These devious dastards have teamed up with the Federation, and they are observing the unsuspecting Ba'ku before they pack them off the planet. Dressed in orange outfits which enable them to pass sight unseen among the inhabitants, Son'a and Federation scientists both study the planet and plan for the removal of the Ba'ki. When the Son'a fire without provocation on Data, the pale-faced android short-circuits and destroys the cloaking device concealing the expedition from the Ba'ku. Suddenly, the Ba'ku find themselves surrounded by intruders. Hijacking a starship, Data opens fire on the Son'a flagship from which the Son'a chieftain, Ru'afo (F. Murray Abraham, who played the evil Salieri in Amadeus), and Star fleet Admiral Dougherty (Anthony License to Kill Zerbe), coordinate the mission.Dougherty contacts Picard during a diplomatic ceremony and requests Data's schematics. When Picard offers to help, Dougherty politely declines. Pointing out that the Enterprise has been assigned elsewhere, Dougherty assures the inquisitive captain that Ru'afo and he can handle Data. An incredulous Picard decides to check things out for himself; he cannot believe that Data would turn rogue without a good reason. As they chart a course for the far side of the galaxy, Picard invites Worf on Deep Space Nine to accompany them. When Picard's navigator indicates that the Ba'ku planet is in the opposite direction of what they have been ordered, Picard shrugs it off as if it were nothing. When the Enterprise enters the 'Briar Patch,' the age reversal harmonics of the Ba'ku planet affect the crew. Cmdr. Riker (Jonathan Frakes) and Lt. Cmdr. Troi (Marina Sirtis) rekindle a long-dormant romance. Soaking by candle-light in a tubful of bubbles, Troi shaves off Riker's beard. Not only does Cmdr. La Forge (Roots LeVar Burton) regain his sight without the aid of technology, but also he experiences his first sunrise. Lt. Cmdr. Worf (Michael Dorn) suffers an outbreak of Klingon acne as well as a blood lust for combat. Finally, Picard himself dances to mambo music in his own quarters. When he beams down to the planet, Picard falls in love with the sensuous Anij (Donna Murphy), a 350 year old Ba'ku dame who doesn't look a day over 40 thanks to the regenerative particles in the planet's rings. Sadly, Frakes and his writers leave Dr. Crusher (Gates McFadden) hanging without a mini-subplot of her own. Nevertheless, Insurrection qualifies as an ensemble effort with everybody getting into the act, even if they don't have a subplot to distract their actions. The Rick Berman & Michael Pillar script hearkens back to those venerable 1930s' Lone Star westerns with John Wayne where the city slicker bad guys try to steal the mineral rich ranch lands from under the naive pilgrims who don't realize the wealth that lies beneath their lands. Like John Wayne, Capt. Picard decides to intervene. Already deeply in love with Amij, who has shown him the eternal beauty of a single moment in time, Picard disobeys Admiral Dougherty's orders to clear out. Amij reciprocates and supports Picard when he reveals that the Son'a are going to destroy their way of life. As cheery and good-natured as Insurrection is, this Star Trek has its share of problems. Although Insurrection generates warp-speed momentum in story-telling, too many things are left unexplained. The filmmakers rely on the yucky looks of the Saran-wrap-skinned villains who bleed when they become enraged, but Frakes never explains why the Son'a resemble burglars with pantyhose stretched across their faces. No, you neither have to be a Trekkie nor a Trekker to appreciate Insurrection, but it wouldn't hurt. History will record Insurrection as more of a more crew intensive adventure.

The reason is this. Most of the time, when Star Trek does an allegory, it's either dismissed as brainless futurism or allegory on an irrelevant topic. Well, Insurrection has allegory on a very relevant topic and a stinging chapter in American history the removal from native lands of a small group of people in favor of a large group of people. As Picard says himself (one of the best dramatic lines ever issued in a sci-fi film), How many people does it take... before it becomes wrong? Well, a lot of American people view the re-population of America as a good thing. I, even though I live in America, happen to find it repulsive and hideous and disgusting. So the plot line of this film was one I happened to find very intelligent, thought-provoking, necessary, and well-executed. I could talk about the incredible special effects or the phenomenal action sequences, but I believe that the allegory is what really makes this film worthy of a 10 out of 10 rating.

Yes, you can argue this isn't as epic as the great Star Trek films like II, VI, and First Contact, with a localized story which doesn't really put the main characters into any inherent danger, but regardless, this film has its perks. This has to do with the fact that there is a sense of family among The Next Generation crew (with many humorous moments between various cast members - Riker and Troi rekindling their romance as an example - with Riker sporting his Season 1 non-beard look!). This isn't the case in the other Next Generation films in my opinion. This sense of family always brings a smile to my face because it's obvious that this crew has become a close knit group after 9 years together (it also shows how the actors portraying the characters have come to know each other, considering each other as friends).

The Ba'Ku people, represented by actors Donna Murphy and Daniel Hugh Kelley, are intelligent and have knowledge of technology, but have rejected it in favor of a very leisurely pace of simple life. A Federation Admiral argues that removing the Ba'Ku people and mining and prospecting the moon would benefit mankind in millions of ways, and that we are only removing 600 people.

The special effects are average and actually weaker than those in its immediate predecessor, First Contact.  As a result, the action scenes are less than invigorating.

If you haven´t followed the TV-series you will not even be able to understand what the characters are all about.At least the first Star Trek films, with the excellent ´Wrath of Khan´ at the helm, were real movies made for the silver screen.

Murray Abraham Director Jonathan Frakes   103 minutes   Rated PG (for sci-fi violence, mild language, and brief sensuality)By Blake French--Please note this review is coming from an individual who is not a big fan of the titled series/productions, nor against science fiction based movies, including Star Trek.--just thought you'd like to know.The Star Trek series very often appeals to fans of science fiction. And what movie is more true to its genre than Star Trek Insurrection, a film that I highly recommend to people who like Star Trek, but also to individuals who like a smart script and interesting characters; this is not a movie in which you have to be a member of the trekkie club to enjoy-I know this because I'm not one. Watching it with an open mind should be enough.The story is little complicated to explain if you're not familiar with the baseline of events that have propelled the many years of productions. To make a long story short, it takes place in the future. Massive space vessels house the members of elite teams to promote world peace, sort of. There are good and bad guys. The ship in focus in Star Trek Insurrection is called the Enterprise, with a crew including Commander Geordi LaForge (LeVar Burton), Commander Data (Brent Spiner) and Captain Jean-Luc Picard.The plot basically involves one individual planet located in the middle of space. It apparently holds the beloved galaxy mixture that produces eternal youth. The planets' inhabitants are humble and kind, but when the film's villain comes along lusting for revenge to solve past conflicts, it is up to the Enterprise and her crew to save the day for the 600 innocent pedestrians who have been living happily in this world for several hundred years.The film starts out with a pretty solid story, and a relatively interesting though-line of events that connect to each other--and continues its success throughout the production. Although there are few comic elements here and there, Star Trek Insurrection takes itself seriously. It doesn't go over the top with anything, including visual effects. The story has some depth to it, perhaps even enough to interest the anti-science fiction folks as well as the trekkies.The dialogue is smart and focused. The characters stay on task, without too many interruptions distracting them. It does, however, explain some of the plot to us, instead of showing the audience with actions and events. But even then, it keeps us informed on the many confusions accruing in the film.The performances are good, but not great. There isn't a strong supporting cast here, or at least one with major significance. Patrick Stewart comes off as a little overwrought, although I did like his performance. Jonathan Frakes, who also directs this film, is a little different in character here. I suppose you could call him the villain, but not really. See the film, then you'll understand what I mean.The special effects in Star Trek Insurrection aren't anything special, and to some extent, a bit disappointing. The space ships are pervasive and good looking, but not awe-inspiring. There are a few neat explosions and laser wars that are realistic--and the makeup effects are, as always, perplexing. But overall, although the plot is solid, Jonathan Franks focuses a little too much on story here, and not enough on one of the main traditional reasons that many people will see this film for special effects.Brought to you by Paramount Pictures.

Where is the customary urgency, the sense that the crew needs to race time to save humanity? It's missing because the actors make no effort to make us care about the people on this planet that makes them stay youthful.A subplot involving a romance between Riker (Jonathan Frakes) and Counselor Troi (Marina Sirtis) is handled with such an abruptness and awkward timing that it generates no interest.  The comedic moments are so badly timed that they aren't funny, just perplexing.Captain Picard's involvment with one of the planet's inhabitants is sweet but inconsequential.  And other subplots concerning Data are wasted, adding only annoyance to the film.Even the usually adequate special effects and sets are cheesy this time. The magic is not there.Frakes directed the much more confident First Contact a few years ago. That film was suspensful, funny and well-acted.  The story moved with eased and grace, creating a sense of awe and interest in its characters. Insurrection is directly the opposite.  Instead of moving along breezily, it slogs along.

I remember disliking Insurrection when it came out, for all the usual reasons lame comic relief, an ineffectual villain, muddled morals.In The Wrath of Khan we learned that The needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few, which is used here as the villains' justification. The Sona are many, and the Baku are few, so the Sona get the Federation's help to move the Baku off the Fountain of Youth Planet. Picard gets in the way, and adventure and excitement ensue.I like my Star Trek movies to have some kind of meaning to them, so I appreciate that screenwriter Michael Piller tried to make this a story about forced relocation. That's a sensitive subject to Americans, because we don't like to look at the seedier aspects of our collective past, but it's a very good topic for Trek to cover. Too bad it gets swamped by technobabble, pointless details, and hectic action scenes. There's a good story in there somewhere.The other big issue is the attempt to make this movie lighter and more fun than the previous movie, First Contact. The jokes are still as forced and un-funny as the comedy in any other Trek movie, so the real problem is that the writer and producers decided to include so many of them. Most of them are rather juvenile, such as the scene where Worf has a Klingon pimple. Some other groans come from the direction of Data and his mawkish attempts to understand humanity.As usual with Next Gen films, the focus is exclusively on Picard and Data. Everyone else gets little cameos to remind you of their existence Worf gets a zit, Geordi grows new eyes, Riker shaves his beard, etc. Troi and Crusher probably get the smallest parts.So, I can't fault this movie for its aspirations, but I'll have to agree with public opinion on this one.

I really want to like it, because it at least attempts to have a sophisticated philosophical and moral component, but ultimately I find it to be preachy and - worse yet - rather flat.The beginning of the film shows some promise. The sequence when Data goes berserk, though hardly thrilling, is pretty exciting and it rouses the audience's curiosity about what's going on. Unfortunately, I think the screenwriters chickened out a bit and failed to really explore Data's potential as an antagonist (if only a temporary one).There's also some good character development and even some decent humor moments early on. I enjoy the romance scenes between Troi and Riker, and I wish their subplot was given some more screen time and development. (It sure is more interesting than watching Worf re-develop his adolescent acne troubles!) The film starts to fall apart in the second act, when the moral dilemma is introduced. Picard makes a lot of big speeches about how the forced relocation of the Ba'ku is a huge crime - but the film, and its villains, are so tame that I never really feel like the Ba'ku are in any great danger. Also, the Ba'ku society is simply unconvincing; it all seems too idyllic, too perfect. Their village doesn't look like a place where people really live - it's more like a superclean Hollywood set, isn't it? Speaking of the villains, they're unusually weak here, especially by Star Trek standards. F. Murray Abraham may have been great in Amadeus, but he's awful here as Ru'afo, the putty-faced bad guy. Great Star Trek villains of the past were usually either tough and over-the-top (like Khan), or cunning and dignified (like General Chang), but Ru'afo possesses none of these qualities. He's basically a whiny brat. At one point, he even emits a thoroughly childlike and embarrassing shriek of defeat - why should I respect this guy? The film also has other, production-related problems. It's the first Star Trek film to rely exclusively on computer-generated (CGI) special effects, and while some of the effects shots are pretty, others already look rather primitive and cartoon-like, by contemporary standards.Adding to the list of woes, the space battle scenes are distinctly lacking in verve. Part of the problem is the repetitive music, which fails to generate tension. There's also a lot of boring medium and long shots in the battle scenes. By contrast, Wrath of Khan and First Contact generally used close-up shots that were far more effective (the photon torpedoes in those films tend to shoot right toward the viewer's face, for example).I also really hate the fact that Riker needs to contrive a weird gimmick to defeat the Son'a ships, which somehow involves a joystick and lots of incomprehensible techno-babble. Why can't the Enterprise just tear into an enemy ship for a change? Why does there always have to be some stupid angle to the fights? Lest I sound entirely negative, I'd like to point out that Jonathan Frakes' direction in this film is still pretty solid (he also helmed the previous, far more successful Star Trek film, First Contact). He includes lots of lovely panoramic shots of the countryside that occasionally give the film a very poetic and attractive feel. But, by contrast, the interior sets - and I'm thinking chiefly of Ru'afo's ship here - are really ugly and crude-looking.On balance, then, I really believe this is the worst film of the Star Trek stable. There's no way I can accept that Star Trek V could be called worse than this! (Shatner at least had a clear vision for that film, even if its execution was flawed.) Even the often-tedious Star Trek I is better than Insurrection, if only because it has more dignity...

But is that really what we look for in a Star Trek movie? No. At least it isn't what I look for. It's what I would expect from an episode on the series, but not in a full-length feature film. While I found this production to be quite well done, I never expected such low quality to be present in one of the movies. This FELT and played like an over-long episode of the television series. Spiner and Stewart, having the control they do, get to make script changes seemingly at whim, before ever signing into their contracts, guaranteeing them certain assurances of screen time and story line. Both have apparently utilized that option in this production, and with Frakes directing, it seems to have created a serious gap in the production quality.This simply was not of feature film quality and should have been reduced to the weekly series where it belonged. That having been said, there is one other seriously disturbing factor to this installment. The procedures performed upon the So'na were just disgusting. This was an obvious attempt to draw horror fans and teens who had not grown up with the series, into the Star Trek fold. Gore has no place in Star Trek, in my opinion. There are many franchises which offer that feastial eye candy, and Star Trek, until this production, was not one of them. Because of that sole factor, this movie turned off a lot of die-hard fans.Premise the Ba'ku are a nature and peace loving society who live on a planet which is the apparent equivalent of Tuck's Everlasting, in that the environment provides an almost eternal life to its inhabitants. The So'na, lead by Ru'afo, have worked with Star Fleet in establishing a base, secreted in the heart of the Ba'ku village from which they can bear witness to the life of the Ba'ku, run tests on the environment, and attempt to duplicate the effects of the planet's environment on behalf of the So'na who are dying, as a race.However, DATA malfunctions, due to some unknown interference, and exposes the hidden base, and its inhabitants to the Ba'ku, thereby nullifying the entire mission. The mystery is why? The premise is quite good, but as I said, it belonged more as part of the series, rather than this line of feature films.Also, Piccard's love interest was rather disturbing. I expected Kirk to go after every female within a 20 light year radius, but not Piccard. I thought it was well-established that that was Riker's job, anyway. It rates a 7.6/10 from...the Fiend .

One of my biggest complaints was the comedy-too much, too corny, and ultimately, too stupid. The special effects were good, but there were no truly spectacular sequences to show them off. The brief space battle sequence was unexciting, and even a little too cerebral. Why not just fight a ship the old fashioned way, using phasers and photon torpedoes, not meteor gas or whatever it was. And what happened to the good old leading man fights leading bad guy one on one in the finale? I was waiting and hoping for this, but it never happened. In conclusion, the movie was a mess, and definitely the weakest Trek movie to date (yes, I liked Star Trek V better than this).

It's all very light and lacking in oomph, so much so in fact that you've got time to concentrate on the surprisingly cheap looking special effects and Jerry Goldsmith's anonymous score - God knows why they kept hiring him, he hadn't put anything descent together since the beginning of the decade. Dissilusioned fans on horror watch should look out for moments like Data's cringe inducing lock and load line (this is Star Trek not a Jerry Bruckheimer movie) or my all time favourite in which Riker proclaims We're thorough running from these bastards! before pressing a button to reveal a PC joystick to steer the ship.

There is little substance or dimension in it to translate it into a movie. A movie on screen should not feel like a television series. This does.

Picard must stop the nasty Federation and aliens (read invaders) who wish to use the land of some peaceful colonists (read Native Americans). Now was their plan to massacre the settlers there? No. In fact they were going to re-locate them to a nice new home. If the planet had been taken was their objective to harvest the healing properties for latinum? No, it was to help heal thousands of people. So basically it ends up this Picard is risking his life so a bunch of stubborn colonists (yes non-natives) don't have to move to a nice new home rather than potentially helping untold millions live a better life. Star Trek moralising is mostly highly irritating but this must be the zenith of cringe-worthyness.The script? Some of the lines are dreadful.

The most common complaint - yes, let's get the negative crap out of the way first - about Insurrection is that it feels like a drawn-out episode of Next Gen. Yes, this is true, but is that really such a bad thing? The plot structure is certainly reminiscent of some of the moral dilemmas faced by the Enterprise's crew, and the themes of life, death, youth, aging, property rights, and human (and alien) rights permeate this inter-species and intercultural tale, making for an interesting and appealing story that should attract a broad spectrum of viewers - both fans and non-fans alike.The villains, however, do seem to be underwritten and, despite what little material he had to work with, F. Murray Abraham does an excellent job of fleshing out the lead baddie. I feel that it was a good decision on the part of the writers to take us to a whole new world and story with a new species different from all past Trek films, but in doing so, they seem to not have quite as much mythology to fuel the characterizations and the story line, overall.The effects are spectacular, and the Enterprise-E has never been more beautiful. The outer space shots are superb, colorful, and eye-catching. All the rest of the technical aspects of the movie are slick as Hollywood can produce, and the editing, sound, and production design are all top notch. Ultimately, however, Insurrection does fall short of becoming a true- blue classic, if only because of the execution of a story that's, while different and interesting, not exactly involving or even memorable. It's definitely worth it, however, if you happen to purchase all four Next Gen movies in their blu-ray four pack, and there are some cool bonuses involving the making of Insurrection and the direction they took in terms of story and design.All in all great effects, slick production, classic cast, silly humor, beautiful cosmic cinematography, and a story that barely holds it all together. 6.5/10 "},{"Title":"This Star Trek Movie is underrated","Date":"27 March 2013","Score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi","Review":" This TNG film is underrated and it focused on the problem of dislocating a few people to satisfy the demands of a much larger group of people.

They've always been caught between catering to the demands of the fan circuit, and operating as a space adventure to reach mass market appeal. In 1998, The Next Generation had been off the air for four years. And the fans, being the salivating dogs that they are (myself included), have demanded that TNG continues to boldly go where no one has gone before. But this sadly has worked to variable effect on film.ST Generations was completely ill-prepared for the big screen and ended up severely lacking. While First Contact managed to do everything right that the other film did so wrong. But with ST Insurrection, the film series almost looks out of steam. First Contact had an exceptionally involving plot to concentrate on. That isn't the case here.If you are a fan of the series, Insurrection will seem eerily familiar. That's because it resembles one of TNG's two-part stories. But also (for those eagle-eyed ST fans) its a combination of two episodes from the series, Who Watches the Watchers? and Homeward. The themes of a primitive culture being observed in secret by Starfleet, and the idea of forced relocation.After Jonathan Frakes did a superb job directing First Contact, he returns to see out Insurrection. And while his direction is as excellent as ever, he doesn't quite deliver on the promise he showed with First Contact. The film raises a few interesting points about the ethics of humanity in the 24th Century, and the so-called enlightened human race. But it doesn't quite sink its teeth into it the way it ought to. That's the type of self-analysis that Deep Space Nine does so well.But its only skated over in Insurrection. There are quite a few things about the film that bother me actually. For one, the plot Insurrection is graced with hardly seems worthy of a feature film. Like I said, this one really should have been a two-parter in the series. The villains hardly set the world on fire, and barring Patrick Stewart, the regulars are given precious little to do.The film's plot about a planet that promotes immortality is something that Gene Roddenberry might have thought up for The Original Series. Although I'm sure in his hands it would have emerged much more laboured and stilted than it does here. It's to Frakes' credit that he doesn't batter us over the head with heavy-handed moralising. Yes the film does raise a few ethical points, but they never feel strident.The alien culture of the week this time is the Ba'Ku, a peaceful race of technophobes who live on this wondrous planet of youth and beauty. But a militant race the So'Na want the planet and its powers of rejuvenation to ensure the longevity of their own dying race. Even if it means strip-mining the place. So with Federation assistance(!), they plan to relocate the Ba'Ku. Not if Picard has anything to say about it!ST Insurrection feels inconsequential as a major motion picture. Personally I feel ST films are notoriously difficult to get right. They either wind up too overblown or too underwhelming. And the TNG films are especially indicative of that problem. First Contact is the only one that managed to pull everything together, but that's because it was driven by an exceedingly strong story.I just didn't care much for the one that propelled Insurrection. Its a shame that for all the sophistication and confidence Frakes demonstrated with FC, he fails to do the same here. He delivers plenty when it comes to the special effects and action sequences but the cast are a whole different kettle of fish.Frakes sets up little vignettes for each individual cast member (except Gates McFadden's Dr Crusher. Like the preceding entries, she's given criminally little to do), but somehow I found them wanting. Picard gets a romance. Riker rekindles his with Deanna Troi's. Data learns about fun. Geordi regains the use of his eyes. And Worf rediscovers Klingon puberty.Picard comes off OK because his love interest (Donna Murphy) is a worthy match for him. They're romance is fine. But Riker's and Troi's really should have been left on the cutting room floor. As should Data's story. Its nice to see him emotionless again. His character has suffered somewhat of late thanks to that emotion chip, but he's not given anything worthwhile to work with.The scene where Geordi enjoys a sunset with normal vision is nice because of LeVar Burton's natural style of acting, but nothing else is made of it. And as for Worf, ever since he jumped ship to DS9, the writers have had to contrive to outrageous lengths to get him back in the cast. In First Contact, they just about got away with it, but here he makes some vague offhand remark about being in the same star system, which I didn't believe for a second.At least Frakes delivers the requisite thrills and spills. Battles in space and on the ground are pretty exciting, even if the hopping about from place to place does get a bit wearisome. There are some lovely shots of a nebula cloud, the Ba'Ku village makes use of some beautiful location shooting, and the So'Na solar sail is impressive inside and out.But Star Trek Insurrection failed to move me. It opens with a whopper of a shocker. Data goes berserk, attacking his own colleagues in an invisibility suit. But then the film settles into a comfortable ease that feels slack for far too much of the running time. Its a shame it took a further film for the producers to realise TNG had run its course. Galaxy Quest, which emerged the following year, and although a spoof, is actually a far superior film. Its everything a Star Trek film ought to be, and everything Insurrection isn't.

Picard, of course, is the convergence of the two he is wise beyond his years while still a member of a technological society.The story is tight and well-developed. There aren't a lot of forced actions, i.e. Why did he do that? Perhaps Picard and Data have too much screen time, but it does keep the story focused and on track. Jonathan Frakes as Riker has one of his more commanding roles and does a great job of directing as well.There's also a good dose of character development, including romance, friendships new and old, and witty banter.If you like the rock 'em, sock 'em conflicts of Star Trek II and VI, Insurrection is not for you (though I love Star Trek II as well). I think of it more along the lines of Star Trek IV, with great characters and a plot with feeling (minus much of the goofy humor of IV).

But more galactially involved than the others. The last few notable times involved saving Spock. From the Genesis planet (Star Trek 3) and from his ponn far (Amok Time). This time, it involve saving a civilization from the Federation.But there is still some problems with the movie (All will be reveled from interviews and trailers without using spoilers). Like how did Worf get on board the Enterprise when he was stationed at Deep Space 9? That was never really answered. As well as the foreshadowing on who is going to the planet, specifically what the crew are wearing when they decided to start the insurrection.But the movie still maintains a fair amount of continuity and other features that are very appealing. Riker now clean shaved when he sported a beard since the second season of the Next Generation ten years earlier. Discussion of the Dominion war as well as the Borg from Deep Space Nine and Star Trek First Contact. As well as Geordi's eyes.Either way, it's Star Trek at its best. Bring forth the prime directive, the classic decision making, and will be very appealing to many.

In fact, with the benefit of seven years behind me, it seems that this may be the strongest of the Trek movies to feature the Next Generation crew, especially in light of the terrible Nemesis.First and foremost, the thing that separates Star Trek from Star Wars is in play continuously. The Next Generation TV show excelled in its ability to serve up complex moral dilemmas in 45-minute bites, but the previous two movies before this one had not really bothered with these problems. While somewhat underdeveloped, Insurrection does feature a moral issue prominently - a risk that is admirable in light of the Manichean world view that dominates most action films. This is, by the way, most certainly an action movie. There are more shootouts and space battles in Insurrection than in Nemesis and Generations combined, an especially impressive fact considering that there was no other meat to either of the aforementioned Treks.Finally, and perhaps most importantly, this is the only Next Generation movie to show the cast at the height of their chemistry. The last few seasons of the TV show were characterized primarily (in both its best and worst moments) by the friendship between cast members that was so clearly visible in its performances. Neither of the two previous movies or the one after show this as clearly as Insurrection does. All actors seem at ease with their characters and each other.Does Insurrection deliver for non-Trek fans? I would answer with a qualified yes. As all the Next Generation movies do to an inordinate degree, Insurrection relies on prior knowledge of the characters and ideas of the TV show, thus consigning it to a niche market of moviegoers. However, there is still enough wit, complexity, and excitement left to enjoy, even after the prior knowledge is subtracted, to make it a fairly satisfying movie. Recommended with a caveat for non-Trekkies - this may be an acquired taste.

We're led to believe that all of Starfleet is behindthis eco- and relocation-atrocity but by the end the Starfleet villainswere just one or two people who wanted to take the technobabbleradiation and treat people across the Federation with it.

However, Insurrection has it's own good moments, and is still a better movie then many others that are out there.  The story was written by Michael Pillar, who has been a genius in writing Trek for over a decade.  In typical Star Trek genius, the story deals with something that Humans have dealt with since time immortal The Fountain of Youth.  In space, one is found.  It is the Planet Bak'u in the Briar Patch. There is a race known as the Son'a who want to posses it's regenerative effects, and there are several Starfleet Officers who are willing to go along with them.  Included in them is Admiral Mathew Dougherty.  As usual, the Crew of the Starship Enterprise are there to save the defenseless Bak'u from the ruthlessness of the Son'a and their compatriots.  The story itself is strong, and asks many questions, the most obvious is do we have the right to live forever? A question that was also asked in Star Trek Generations, and one in which Trek has left open for debate.  So the question of this film is If we find a fountain of youth, is it morally right to use it?  And at what cost?

As long as the Federation exist, So does 'SECTION 31'.. now thats sounds rhetorical. This division acquires support from lower ranking officers to the very high levels of echelon.During the film you'll hear the Admiral say something along these lines, I'm acting on orders from the Federation Council. This is true but those orders where from high-ranking Starfleet officers in line with 'SECTION 31'. This is what makes the movie more mysterious and how the plot has more interwoven threads then it cares to expose. Why would the Federation do this? And thats what Picard was asking himself. Of course after the films' plot 'Section 31' would no doubt be pulling out and the Federation of course would have no evidence of what actually occurred or what began this all.There is more story to this film that what appears, of course you could read what I've said so far but it barely touches the surfaces.

While it was pretty funny to see Mozart's nemesis Salieri (F.

It was also quite disheartening to see that nearly all of Starfleet, with the exception of the Enterprise crew, were suddenly so corrupt. What happened?!Data managed to be both cool and irritating, and not in the Oh, that wacky Data! way, either. Nearly everytime he was around that little boy, I just wanted to turn it off.

I really enjoy the sense of camaraderie that seems to have built up among these characters over the years, and this is really the first time we've seen it played out on screen.  I also like the references to the Federation's losses to the Borg and the Dominion, making it feel as though these really are dangerous times for the Federation and it's Starfleet.As the movie progresses, the storytelling becomes more whimsical, with the peaceful Ba'Ku being juxtaposed with the aggressive and warlike Son'a.  The scenes that take place on the planet have just the right feel to them, and you can see where the money went, the Ba'Ku village sets look fantastic, although I must say that the Son'a ship sets are diabolical.I'd say that Insurrection is definitely the best of the odd-numbered Trek films, and that the supposed 'curse' may even have been broken.

It is found out later that Data is Malfunctioning.  Picard and crew go to investigate and find something disturbing.  After they capture Data in a spectacular aerial chase.  They find out he was damaged by phaser fire, because he was going to discover the Federation hollow ship, which is sent to remove the Ba´ku. The planet is found out to have regenerative properties, that interest the Federation and the Soná.  Picard finds out about this and realizes that this goes against the Prime Directive.  He confronts the Admiral in charge of the mission, but the Admiral gives him orders to leave.  So Picard and crew go renegade, and stop this removal.The cast in the film shines.  Patrick Stewart is great as Picard.  Picard is a Captain that is loyal to Starfleet ideals.  He believes that those ideals are threatened because starfleet would condone these sort of actions. Riker and Troi´s romance blossomed in this film, and Riker shaves off his beard. I hope there is a follow up to this romance in the next film.  Data was great as usual.  I loved seeing him interact with the Ba´ku boy, and I liked seeing him play in the hay at the end of the film.  It was great that the character was interested in what it is like to be a child.  Data has been a character that has been explored in each of the next generation films. Worf had his moments too, seeing him endure Klingon puberty was hilarious, because of the planet metaphasic properties, and when Georgi regained his sight was a powerful moment in the movie.Insurrection failed to live up to its predecessor.  I believed that Ruáfo played by F. Murray Abraham didn´t live up to Alice Krige´s Borg Queen.  I felt that he was a weak and misguided villain who followed rules, unlike the Borg who don´t care about a planets population.  The film lacked numerous action sequences.

The characters' passions were drawn out of the script, helped along by the superb acting talents of Patrick Stewart (as usual), Brent Spiner and (in a supporting role) Donna Murphy. Even the smaller roles had delightfully appropriate moments, such as Beverly Crusher's (Gates McFadden) derisive snort when Picard (Stewart) claims his collar size is the same now as at the Academy forty years ago.One thing I have found disconcerting is the most common objection to the movie Insurrection that the moral theme of the story is flawed. I believe anyone who thinks this is either ignorant of or is ignoring one of the fundamental tenets of the Star Trek series that is, the basic human (sentient?) rights of an individual are sacrosanct, and to violate them is to devalue those rights for all.I have heard the line the greatest good for the greatest number quoted to argue against what Picard et al did during the movie - that the forcible displacement of 600 people in order to benefit millions was an acceptable moral decision. I'm sorry, but I cannot agree. A more apt aphorism for such an action is the ends justifies the means, and the mere fact that so many people charge Insurrection as being flawed in presenting this position as wrong demonstrates how far we have to go, morally, as a people.The greatest good for the greatest number would apply if, say, limited food resources had to be sent somewhere, and the choice was to a million people on Colony A and 600 people on Colony B. Nothing active is being done to harm the 600, only to try and save the million. The situation in Insurrection, however, was the active and deliberate abrogation of the rights of the 600 in order to gain an additional benefit for the millions.Whichever way you slice it, this boils down to the ends justifying the means, pure and simple. It is no different from saying it was okay for Josef Mengele to experiment on Jewish prisoners during the Holocaust because the fruits of his research have led to cures for many diseases as a result of improved understanding of genetics. Should the research be thrown out? No - that would not bring back those who were sacrificed. Should it be repeated? Not in a million years.The same applies to the moral principle here as Picard so eloquently points out when told it's only six hundred people. When does it become wrong, Admiral? When it's a thousand? Fifty thousand? A million? When does it BECOME wrong?The actions were in the character of Captain Picard (as demonstrated in the The Next Generation episode Journey's End), who despises the concept of forced relocation of people, and they were within the moral framework long-established for Star Trek.The mere fact that so many people today object to this ethical position is ample evidence that we still have a *long* way to go before we can hope to establish a gentle, democratic and rights-respecting government such as the United Federation of Planets.

The fact that they choosea horrible special effects company because they couldn't wait for the good one to be done with Star Wars does not bother me nearly as much as the scrap-pile script. If this film had made as much money as First Contact, then P. Stewart would not have said that he's creatively bored and that the next one should be the last.

This movie is a lot deeper than one would think and does a good job foreshadowing the events.First of all is the small scene near the beginning where Picard notices the slight difference in the ship's vibration.  While many may see this scene as filler, it ties very nicely into Picard's character as well as the Baku's abilities.  Picard is able to have total control of his environment and therefore has attained the peace of mind the Baku talk about.There are several moments in this film that are small like the aforementioned scene, but that tie very nicely into the overall storyline. Things like Worf having a nightmare, which many attribute to the recent loss of his wife on DS9 and Geordi experiencing a headache, which is a prelude to his regaining his sight.  Perhaps the best of these small moments is when Worf arrives.  The producers did a nice job of avoiding the cliché of getting Worf back on the Enterprise with a reasonable explanation by drowning out his answer.  A lot of scenes in this movie neglect trivial details to focus on the larger picture.The film is also full of great dialogue that ties the crew of the Enterprise to the events in DS9, but still keeping them separate.  If you do not watch DS9, you will not miss anything here, but if you do, you'll be able to pick up on these small things.  Perhaps the best of these lines is Picard's lament, `do you remember when we used to be explorers?'The action in this film is well paced and the humor is right on key.  The pace moves quickly and never gets bogged down.  Best of all, the characters, while still staying true to what came before are given more humanized dialogue.  Troi and Crusher discuss what the environmental conditions are doing to their bodies and Worf tries to live down Klingon pimples.Picard shines through in this movie as does Patrick Stewart's acting abilities.  Taking a cue from `First Contact's' dialogue about `the line must be drawn here,' Stewart is given a lot of speeches that he delivers masterfully.  If I were being exploited, I'd want Captain Picard on my side.I recommend this movie wholeheartedly.  Do not see it with preconceived notions, but do see it if you want action, humor, humanized characters, and a little romance.

My hopes weren't all that high for this one because the odd-numbered movies in the series have been weaker than the even-numbered ones and it received mostly lukewarm responses from critics. But to my surprise, it was better than I expected, and it falls right behind Star Trek III as the second best odd-numbered Star Trek movie. Star Trek Insurrection is a more lighthearted movie than the previous film in the series (the much darker Star Trek First Contact). Insurrection takes the Enterprise crew to a planet that seems to be a fountain of youth. The people of this mystical world (known as the Ba'ku) have their lives threatened by a race of baddies (the Son'a) who have one thing in common with these people. Captain Picard (Patrick Stewart) eventually finds out that the Son'a are on orders from the Federation counsel. This gets Picard steaming mad. So he, along with the rest of the Enterprise crew, tries to help out the Ba'ku from getting into the hands of the Son'a. The special effects this time out are not quite top-notch as in the other Star Trek films with the possible exception of Star Trek I and Star Trek V, but the effects are pretty entertaining. Plus this film is nicely paced and never boring. Jonathan Frakes, who plays Riker, stepped behind the cameras for the second straight time to direct a Star Trek film, and once again does an exceptional job. He made this film as well as First Contact fun, and he makes the Enterprise crew look like their having a great time making it. The entire cast of Next Generation is here (Stewart, Frakes, Brent Spiner, LeVar Burton, Michael Dorn, Gates McFadden, and Marina Sirtis) and all do their job well. Guest stars this time out include Tony award winning actress Donna Murphy as Anij, a Ba'ku woman who Picard falls in love with; Oscar winning actor F. Murray Abraham (Amadeus) as Ru'afo, the leader of the Son'a; and Anthony Zerbe as Admiral Dougherty, a member of the Federation who tries to assist the Son'a. Star Trek Insurrection is not a perfect movie. There are a few scenes that are too silly for words, and Abraham is an even sillier villain. But overall, it's an enjoyable film. As far as the Star Trek films to star the Next Generation cast go, it's not as good as First Contact but it's better than Generations.

But I'm getting ahead of myself, since they couldn't sell us the viewer this sketchy premise to begin with.First off, why are the S'ona and B'aku fighting over an entire planet? There are only 300 B'aku, couldn't they share the planet?  I mean, it's a planet!  Oh wait, that's what they end up doing anyway.  Good thing they needed Picard to step in and help them figure that out.While I sat in the theater and watched Picard and Worf singing, Roddenberry's ghost appeared before me and asked, What is this?   What happened to my 'Wagon Train to the Stars' concept?The renegade admiral was a good idea on paper, and could've been executed well, but instead of making a powerful man fall from grace, ADM Dougherty was shifty, weak in his leadership ability and made you wonder how he would get promoted in the first place.Once again, the beautiful and wonderful Gates McFadden had nothing to do but talk about her breasts with Troi.  Hopefully in Star Trek X, she'll get some romance time Picard, instead of some new age guest star.After a lifetime of blindness and computer generated sight, Geordi finally gets to see and Picard couldn't care less.  Everyone else suffers from Chekov Syndrome by proxy, the condition in which the extras get more screen time than the co-stars.  Only Data is spared from this fate, and his emotion chip is turned off the whole film, thankfully, since Data with emotions is like a laughing Vulcan and that worked well didn't it?This movie tried to be funny like Voyage Home but everyone forgot to place the characters in a humorous circumstance.

That honor is between The Motionless Picture and Final Frontier.  Insurrection is a little bit better than Generations also.  So where did this movie go wrong?  I don't know.After the monster success of First Contact, maybe producers felt that people would watch anything dealing with Star Trek.  The movie did have a good premise, protecting a planet that gave eternal youth, from our own Federation!  Good idea, great foundation to start building on, unfortunately the screen writers thought that humor should be involved with this concept as well.  There are an incredible number of jokes in this film, an even split between good ones and bad ones.  Some slapstick here and there also.  A lot of the humor resorts back to Final Frontier where there was an overabundance of it, the nice thing is none of the characters are really being made fun of that much as they were in the film formerly mentioned.  Still, a lot of the humor seems to be painfully out of place, like how Worf and Picard capture Data, Worf's Klingon pimple, and Picard's bead necklace.  The humor is so out of place that it seems our heros have forgotten that a mad man is orbiting the planet and is intent on killing off all of its inhabitants.  Which brings me to my next point, the villain.F. Murray Abraham is an outstanding actor and he does a good job convincing the audience that he is an alien Hitler.  Yet there are so many opportunities the writers never took advantage of in making him that scary of a villain.  We are never given much of a background on him, and are uncertain as to what is his driving motive for wanting to destroy the Baku, is it revenge or the desire to stay healthy and young forever? The screenplay is unforgivably weak, and leaves audiences feeling cheated.  The rekindling of Riker and Troi's relationship is handled so poorly that we are glad to see it so briefly, another missed opportunity by the producers.  This could have been excellent sub-plot to the movie, instead the viewers are treated to Picard developing a possible relationship.Picard meets woman on the planet he is protecting and the two fall of each other.  This handled with a little more care than Riker and Troi were, the chemistry between Stewart and Murphy is commendable, but never really attracts much attention.  (What about Picard and Crusher?  They had more chemistry between them than Picard and Anij)  You never see these two kiss on screen and you are almost glad to see it not happen. The special effects in this film are good, but by no means spectacular as they were in First Contact.  The reason behind this is the fact that producers didn't utilize ILM's wizardry, and it shows, especially when watching this film on television.  Star Trek has not used ILM three times in the past, Insurrection, Final Frontier, and Motion Picture, and all of these films have failed to measure up to their hype.  There is a message there if anyone is listening.  Despite all of its shortcomings, and there are a lot!  Insurrection does offer a nice change of pace for Trekkers, instead of an action packed film, you are given a nice quiet little adventure that will make you laugh along the way.  If you thought First Contact was a little too dark and haunting, then Insurrection is for you.  Even diehard Trekkers will sit through it and find it...amusing.  Although it is no First Contact, it not a Motion Picture, Generation or Final Frontier, either, which makes this the second best of the Odd numbered Treks!

Jerry Goldsmith does another great score.  There was some good drama with Riker & Troy and the Captain with the beautiful lady (forgot her name).

While it does have entertainment value, it really comes off no better than your typical two-part Next Generation TV episode.  The plot is predictable from the beginning of the film (the unknowing race of people being taken advantage of, the starship captain's Damn the Prime Directive declaration, the first we're the bad guy, now we're the good guy opinions that the victims have toward their rescuers, etc.), and the acting no better than what the series had to offer.  Not that it's a BAD film by any means, it just lacks that extra spark that could have ignited this into an exciting blaze of a film.In other words, it would have been a good TV episode.First Contact also suffered from the same problems, but it also managed to dredge up old bits and pieces from the Next Generation TV series, like The Borg as the enemy (we've already HAD a Borg episode, thank you), Data's fully functional sexual status, etc...nothing new is offered in this film, other than to blow everything up on a movie screen instead of the TV.Finally, it still annoys me in these new films that Data now has emotions (when he chooses to use them) and Geordi can now see without his prosthesis; what the producers, directors and storywriters have done is essentially stripped away their uniqueness.  Both had their handicaps, but part of the enjoyment of watching these episodes on TV was watching how Data and Geordi overcame their handicaps as part of the Enterprise team.If this film series is to continue, we need to get beyond the pedestrian plot lines and merely adequate acting.  The high points of the original Star Trek movies were often the guest actors.  Insurrection didn't even have that.  And they all certainly had better plot lines.  All the more reason to pop in a classic Next Generation episode and see how great the television series was, and think of how a good production staff and screenwriting team can give us Trek fans something substantial to bite into.  And silently wish that Gene Roddenberry's death was a bad joke, and that he'll come back to lend his creativity to the franchise.

And that is a shame since The Next Generation movies up to Insurrection were pretty good.Berman and Pillar have written a movie that has elements of a story that Deep Space Nine incorporated into its arc. A moralistic plot that tries to hammer its point to the people watching the movie forced relocating of people, much like what happened to the American Indians, is horrible. No matter what the circumstance, it should be in our moral philosophy that relocating people without their explicit permission is wrong. A variation of Kantian philosophy the ends don't justify the means.As others have mentioned, the plot is flimsy, and the characters of the Enterprise act like buffoons. The romance between Picard and the Baku woman was lacking complete substance. What woman would want to have a relationship with Picard, who has the personality of a door knob? Well, maybe Tipper Gore.Going back to the moral point of view the other Star Trek movies had some moral lesson to teach, but it was hardly as rampant as it was in Insurrection. Oh, sure,  ST4 The Voyage Home wanted us to save the whales, but it was used as background in a time-travel story. However, what Berman and Pillar are trying to say in this movie is that forced deportation no matter the number of people is wrong. Of course, the radiation emanating from the planet had the potential to save trillions of lives in the galaxy, but 600 people would be forced to move! Oh, those poor Baku!Think about this Berman and Pillar. There is something organic that can cure AIDS and it resides only in a certain region on the Earth. On this region contained a village of about 600 people, who would be forced to relocate themselves, because the medical community would need to cultivate the soil for the medication. Who here would be against this policy? A policy that can save millions of lives? It's common sense siding with the 600 persons against millions would be rather stupid, wouldn't it? And yet the writers say that would be totally wrong. Have we forgotten Spock's words in The Wrath of Khan? The needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few?Berman and Pillar better get back on track with the next Star Trek movie. And they will have late 2005 to release due to Episode 3 of Star Wars being released in May of 2005.

The story is meant to have parallels with episodes in our past, the forced relocation of people  for the benefit of larger, more powerful group.  I'm glad to see a more personal Trek that is more character driven than usual, and where its hard to tell the heroes and the villains apart.  Where the movie starts to lose me is with the portrayal of the oppressed people.  We meet this settlement of blonde haired, earnest, white skinned humans who live in paradise.  The planet they live on gives them a special energy that keeps them young-looking,  good-looking, and thin.They knead their bread and weed their gardens under sunny skies  with no hardships, dirty fingernails, nor storm clouds on the horizon.    Apparently the makers of the movie chose non-ethnic extras so the audience wouldn't immediately think of American Indians, Jews, Palestinians, ethnic Albanians.  To me, however this oppressed group comes across more  like affluent and tan Californians in a gated community who want to preserve their way of life from the people who didn't  make it in before the gate closed.  While STNext Generation has always been awfully tidy and utopian, this ends up being too  much like a yuppie Celestine fantasy for me to empathize with these people.    Finally, a couple of sticky points.  Is it realistic to have a group of people who have rejected all machines, yet have warp  capability and can work on an android's positronic brain?  Wouldn't there be tools for android-fixing and something to  practice the tools on?  Wouldn't there also be a space ship somewhere?   If they had let the ship get rusty they wouldn't still have warp  capability, if they kept it running they'd have at least on very complex machine.  Also, considering that there is just one town of 600 people who only travel  on foot and have no interest in starting new little towns, couldn't they let the Federation folks set up a few quiet hospital/spas on the other side of the planet?

I wanted nothing more than to see the beautifully detailed Enterprise E model constructed for First Contact, not the flat CG renderings that appeared throughout the film.  The CG effects produced for Voyager and DS9 hold their own and surpass what was produced for Insurrection (unfortunately when half your budget goes for salaries there's not a lot of money left for top notch effects work).It's been almost a year since the release of Insurrection and Paramount still hasn't green-lighted another feature -- and that's OK.

Any remaining credibility is lost when the killer revelation is revealed that both races are the same, one just called themselves Ragu and the others Prego.To expand on 2a  Why can't the Sona just locate themselves on the other side of the planet and not bring in the Federation (who later tell the Federation how they're a dying breed thanks to breen, romulans, borg, jam heder, etc!) to mess up the planet?Despite a bunch of tests, which convinced the federation and friends but hardly convinced any viewer who appreciates science, anything can happen when piddling about with a planet's atmosphere.There is a lot of silly humor, too, with Data borrowing a Romulan cloak-suit and a dumb shuttle chase by Picard and Word, who merrily break out into song and dance just to confuse Data (and the audience by accident).And if the Federation is now designing ships with cloaks, isn't that violating the treaty of Algeron?  Or was The Pegasus a foreshadow since a lot of the upper eschelon of the Federation were worred about the Pegasus (an experimental ship with cloak) was found near Romulan space...Insurrection is the second of TNG movies to have Picard directly violate Starfleet orders (usually to have Data reply To hell with our orders and getting a loud laugh from the audience).  It was purile in First Contact and now when somebody wants to use the scenario for a serious reason, how many of us are going to really believe it?  personally, I feel that First Contact was never made so the I'm going to violate their direct order routine works for me, but most people love FC to pieces so they won't.Succinctly, they were finally getting back on the right track, but the movie still ends up as being a glossy, sloppily-written TV show story that had plenty of development time to be more.Sorry, but the Trek movie franchise is dying.Maybe Nick Meyer and Harve Bennett will return and save us from the Aged, Old, and Burnt-out Three who have had control of the Trek phenomenon since appx 1988.

I was completely confused by the plot and did not care about the  inhabitants of this planet, nor did I care for the new villains.  If this is supposed to be a franchise Star Trek;  I would suggest that Paramount include more of current and past stories into future Star Trek movies.  There were no tie-ins to the previous Star Trek series, i.e. Deep Space Nine or Voyager. What about all the problems with the Dominion?  What ever happened to the Romulans, what about the Romulan reunification that Spock was working on 7 years ago?  Those are much stronger stories than what Star Trek Insurrection had to serve up.The best, by far of the Star Trek movies, were the Wrath of Khan and The Undiscovered Country.  Because each one of these movies stayed true to stories of past Star Trek episodes and you, as the audiance, cared for the characters because you understood the situations and problems surrounding the story.Paramount needs to stay true with its target audience and not try to meet the demands of over-zealous, but, brilliant actors.  I understand that Patrick Stewart had a lot of say in this movie.Please Paramount give us something more solid instead of trying to put a weak film out every 2 or 3 years, that could best be seen on TV.

The story line was weak, and the action dragged. I used to think I was intelligent, but after watching this movie, twice, I never understood, what the bad guys really wanted to do. How can the villains want to kill their own family. That didn't make much sense.I enjoyed Data's role, but where were the others.

It took a while to adjust to TNG cast, but . . .after two years, I relented, and found the cast to be worthy.  That's what was missing in Insurrection, no cast interplay, or a minor amount.Who ever wrote the script, should go back to writer's school. Who knows, maybe the movie will stand up better on video, in the home. .where we have a great sound system.  Most who say this was a great Star Trek feature haven't paid any attention to the numbers.  Most people, like me, are disappointed. J. Frakes has done better.

It would be great to see perhaps a Deep Space 9 film that details the war with the Dominion, and they pull out all the stops with the space battles.I saw this film with a Trekkie friend, and he loved it.

The writers seem to have tried far too hard to be funny - my fellow movie-goers and I were constantly groaning at the awful jokes made in the movie, including some very ordinary lines from Data. The effects were also lacking somewhat. Whilst the space-based CGI (computer generated images) were spot-on, many of the on-land effects were rather dodgy and reminiscent of old Dr. Who-style effects. Bad blue-screening and unimpressive explosions are just two of the problems seen when the goodies are attacked on land by flying drones.Finally, and this I think is a problem with Star Trek qua futuristic fantasy rather than Star Trek qua a sci-fi film, there is no real action in the film. Try as they might, the film-makers can't make flying a zillion-dollar computer-controlled mega-ship look scary. A shout of Shields are down 60% here, shake the camera there, but that's about it.

We saw that just as the Bond series' controlling personalities (Ian Fleming, Albert Broccoli, Sean Connery, Roger Moore, John Glen, etc.) affected the up-and-down quality of 007 films over the years, so the controlling personalities of Star Trek (Gene Roddenberry, William Shatner, Leonard Nimoy, Nicholas Meyer, Patrick Stewart, Jonathan Frakes, Rick Berman, etc.) have followed the same pattern.And it is during periods of transition, when the old guard fails to depart in a timely fashion, that bad films (or bad sub-plots) get made.  Notice how poor George Lazenby got caught in the middle between Bonds-major in 1969's `On Her Majesty's Secret Service.'  Many 007 fans contend that Lazenby was a terrible James Bond, but that had more to do with uneven support from the controlling personalities, plus a plot--Bond gets married--that was a total departure from the rest of the series.  Additionally, the last two (or three) Roger Moore films were flawed because at fifty-plus years of age, he was forced to use quips more than fisticuffs to defeat his enemies.  These 007 outings also had problems because controlling personality Sean Connery's decision to make 1983's `Never Say Never Again' indicated a desire to compete with--and therefore not give his approval to--Cubby Broccoli's efforts with Roger Moore.  Loyal 007 fans felt torn and did not know who was the `real' James Bond.We've seen similar dilemmas in the Star Trek franchise.  For example, it took SEVEN films for Kirk/Shatner (why quibble?) to resolve his mid-life crisis.  Recall how he elbowed aside Deckard for a command in `Star TrekThe Motion Picture.'  And remember how he bullied his way into the director's chair for the truly abominable `Star Trek VThe Final Frontier'?  No wonder they brought back Nicholas Meyer for `Star Trek VIThe Undiscovered Country.'  Kirk/Shatner's resolution (surprise!) was to go out with a bang, as he should have done ten years before.  Nimoy, too, had to resurrect his character, whose death in `Star Trek IIThe Wrath of Khan' provided the most poignant moment in any of the original Trekkers' films.  As much as I love Spock, he should have stayed dead.  Or simply directed.The past two-and-a-half Star Trek films, using the vastly more talented actors of the Next Generation cast, have blissfully concentrated on ADVANCING THE PLOT, leaving character development riding shotgun.  Or--who woulda thunk it?--making character development a necessary facet of the plot itself.  Recall how, in `Star TrekFirst Contact,' Picard's reluctance to give up his ship stemmed directly from his previous trauma with the Borg. Making plot a priority also helps in those scenes when it is necessary to have long passages of dialogue, those conversations needed to support the story.  The most brilliant use of this notion in the recent `Star TrekInsurrection' was the scene in which Riker has a comlink conversation with the duty officer (which advances the plot), but does it all while in a bathtub with Counselor Troi (which pumps some life into the character development).Even in the worst of the films, Star Trek audiences will enjoy the minutes-long glory shots of the Enterprise, the endless, meaningful glances between characters, and the mellifluous cadence of pseudo-science in Main Engineering, but they will ultimately prefer the movies that put plot first, push the characters ahead, and always keep the franchise moving forward. `Star TrekInsurrection,' around a mere hour and forty minutes, ends with a swift beam-up and a shot of the Enterprise peeling away, and avoids arduous moments of contrived character reaction.  And this is how it should be.

The opening credits of Insurrection provide one example of the latter, the long continuous pan of the Ba'ku complex--an unwarranted and overlong pan (it reveals nothing), this shot was a poor artistic choice for inclusion in the opening credits.To compare films, Insurrection does feel a wee bit more visually opened up and cinema literate than First Contact.  But really, can they not afford a cinematographer?To speak of story flaws, the movie totally lacks a denouement, a conclusion. Boy, is that a glaring technical problem!  You don't just turn up the lights and call that a conclusion!  I could tell the people in the audience were discomfitted by the sudden and inconclusive end to the movie.  Kind of a collective low laugh.I still would like to propose a boycott of this movie.  I posted a suggestion in this forum to boycott this movie, before I had seen it, just judging by a negative Houston Chronicle review I had read and the lame tv ads I had seen.  But then, of course, I went and saw it on the second day. I'm weak!!!The only reason Paramount, or any other studio, keeps cranking out mediocrity, is because they know they can make money.  How do they know they can make money even with a mediocre Star Trek movie?  Because Star Trek has a built-in audience.  That is to say, us suckers.  But we have the power to change that via a boycott.  If we change the money part of the equation, maybe they'll change the quality part.  And I'm not talking about post-production.Yes, the ship is a dud.  Visually uninteresting.  Fake-looking because it is all computer generated.  Guys, go back and look at Star Trek II to see what the Enterprise is supposed to look like.

It sure didn't impress me.  This film was a drama that evolved into a love story that splashed in an anti-climactic finish with a minimal amount of real action.  I was expecting much more action as the previews indicated.I give this movie a rating of 5 which I feel is very generous because it never grabbed me or any of the other people in the audience for that matter. There were some funny moments as the filmmakers tried to make the most of their fountain of youth vs. old age theme.Patrick Stewart provides another fine performance as Captain Jean Luc Picard.  Brent Spiner continues to steal the show with his comic and naive desire to be human. In this case, he wants to know what it's like to be a child.  It's good for a few good laughs.  Another fine performance is provided by Donna Murphy who plays Anij, Picard's romantic interest.  I was, however, disappointed that the filmmakers spent the duration of the film developing this romance between Picard and Anij without Picard making a single attempt to even kiss her.  What was the point?  What we have here is a dramatic love story that never physically materializes.As for action, there was very little.  The crew of the Enterprise gets to shoot their guns and get shot at and chased across the galaxy by the Soma, a desperate band of old men who need their skin stretched and seek to steal a planet from the Bacu.  The action scenes are very laid back.  I felt very relaxed as both sides took aim at each other.  This movie, however, falls way short of the intense, edge of your seat feeling the Star Trek First Contact offered.This is not a must see movie.  However, if you're desperate for action entertainment and you're not interested in seeing one of the kiddie movies that seem to be dominating movie theatres across the country these days, go see it.

All of them keep missing the target of being a film instead of an extended television story.  This is especially true with ST9 (Insurrection), which feels the least cinematic, both visually and story-wise.As part of a greater franchise, this film should have dealt with issues common to at least one of the already established threads, not a totally isolated incident with no bearing on the rest of the series.  Also, there are plenty of established alien races who have never been fully developed (e.g., the Romulans) without creating a totally new race whom we will never see again.This film once again contains a flaw that all the ST films share the Enterprise is the only ship in the entire fleet that can save the day, and it just happens to be there when needed to do so.  It makes one wonder how capable the other ships and their crews are, as well as what they're doing during all of the Enterprise's stories.Speaking of the ship, the Enterprise is no longer a character in the movies, just as the current TV shows' vessels are not.  The Enterprise in the original series and through the first four movies served as an additional character with its own personality and presence.  Now, it is merely a means of conveyance that can be battered, bruised, used, and abused at its masters' wills.  There's no respect for the name (exemplified by Picard's line in ST8, There are plenty more letters in the alphabet), the technology, or the history anymore.To appropriately craft an installment to a franchise as successful and popular as ST, one must look to the internal history of the series.  Which films were the most popular and why?Like any of the ST films with highly conceptual sci-fi devices as the story's focus (1,5,7,9), this film fails to engage the audience and keep them interested in its characters' actions.  In fact about halfway through the film, the pace actually slows and concludes with a very lackluster finale.  The strongest ST films have been those that deal with character- and/or situation-specific plots (2,3,4,6,8).Also, it's important to get away from allowing those skilled in the craft of television production to also create the films, regardless of how talented they are.  With the exception of ST7 (Generations), all of the 'Generation' films have felt like extended television episodes claustrophobic and non-epic.Regarding the special effects, I am saddened to see the complete abandonment of models, miniatures, and explosives to fully rendered computer graphics. Don't get me wrong.  I'm a big proponent of CGI, as a tool, but even I don't think it looks as good or realistic as models do.  Unfortunately, both ST and Star Wars have made these transitions.Though Goldsmith's internal score provides an adequate and melodic background, it still fails to become a presence unto itself like Horner's score did in ST2 (The Wrath of Khan) and ST3 (The Search for Spock). Personally, I am tired of hearing the same score for the films' main themes, as well as the Klingon music every time Worf performs some feat.Speaking of Worf, his inclusion in this film, which was conveniently unexplained, made even less sense (and had even less impact) than his inclusion in the last one.  If their only reason for including him is because he used to be part of that crew, then they need to cut the umbilical cord.  They don't spend enough time as it is giving the other characters (e.g., Crusher, Troi) unique, personal roles.Until the creative team responsible for the ST franchise starts thinking about the films the same way they do about the series--not as isolated episodes but as a continuing saga--the audience will have to weather weakening plots whose success hinges on grandstanding and forced comedy. Regarding the latter, this films harkens very closely to ST5 (The Final Frontier) in both its out-of-place, almost slapstick humor and cutie-pie mentality.  I could have done without the singing and dance segments.Wake up, Rick Berman.  It's high time for some outside blood because your creative inbreeding has already begun to take its toll.

Two years later, the studios looked back on everything that worked with it's previous film and decided to ignore it, and lo...INSURRECTION was created. To ensure action and fun were kept to a minimum, the film centers on a race known as the Ba'ku, who live on a planet where the radiation in it's rings acts as a fountain of youth. The Federation has partnered with another race, the Son'a, to relocate the Ba'ku from their planet to acquire it's youth-giving properties. The Federation, represented by Vice-Admiral Dougherty (Anthony Zerbe), seek to use the planet's powers to aid billions of other people in the galaxy while the Son'a, led by Ad'har Ru'afo (F. Murray Abraham), have their own motives. Captain Picard and the crew of the Enterprise find themselves caught in the middle of this moral quandary and soon side with the Ba'ku, going against Federation orders to see to it the Ba'ku remain on their planet.There really isn't a lot to get excited about with this film. As I'd mentioned, the story finds Picard and his crew faced with a moral question previously approached in STAR TREK II and STAR TREK III do the needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few? Whereas II and III made an exciting multi-feature adventure out of the topic, INSURRECTION gives us two hours that feel as if it could've easily been compressed down to an hour and used as an average episode of the series. Credit is due for the fantastic special effects that continue to evolve with each film, and the space sequences in this movie look better than ever. Some of the ground-based effects don't hold up as well, particularly the Son'a drones used in the middle of the film. One thing can be said for the franchise...they know how to cast a villain. It's one thing that nearly every STAR TREK film (even the bad ones) can seem to do right. F. Murray Abraham, who I'm surprised even agreed to appear in this film, is great as the leader of the Son'a who manipulates the Federation into assisting him in his personal quest against the Ba'ku. Anthony Zerbe does an equally good job as the Starfleet Vice-Admiral whose intentions are good but fails to understand that it's wrong to force an entire race (even if it's only 600 people) to relocate.From the moment the opening credits began rolling, I knew this film was going to be trouble. Whereas the credits of previous films in the franchise have epic music and great visuals as the vast is introduced, the opening credits here look cheap and tacked on as if the budget ran out before they were considered. I was also bothered because the film took on such a light-hearted, goofy tone. Goofiness is all right if used correctly; FIRST CONTACT had some humorous moments in the Cochrane portion of the plot. Here, the laughs are practically center-stage. The film is loaded with corny moments as the crew begins to feel the effects of the planet's radiation Worf has a zit, Riker and Troi act like horny teenagers, and Picard does the mambo. And when the film isn't trying to make us laugh, it's focusing on a romantic subplot between Picard and Anij (Donna Murphy), a 300-year-old Ba'ku who reminds Picard what it is to feel young again. This movie really is a little more than an hour and a half of fighting and fleeing, with a couple good adrenaline moments tossed in to ensure people aren't getting too bored with the movie. I suppose we as the audience earned a space battle for sitting through Picard, Data, and Worf singing a musical number from Gilbert and Sullivan. Speaking of Worf...why is he here? I realize the filmmakers want to try and preserve the full cast of the Enterprise-E for the films and that, with Worf now on DS9, they need to find reasons to cram him in, but they didn't even try here. In the beginning of the film, Picard asks Worf why he's on-board and he begins to explain but it's quickly cut-off and never mentioned again. The screenwriters were too lazy to even come up with a valid reason as to why Worf is on the ship...It's not a terrible film, it's just a major let-down. The story is pretty boring for good portions of the film and the ending isn't exciting enough to make me leave the film with a sense of awe. Everything about this film reeks of episodic television, right down to the bland flat lighting in just about every scene (at least GENERATIONS had some creative lighting from John Alonzo). I hate that Jonathan Frakes, who did so well directing FIRST CONTACT, went out with a fizzle on this movie. The studio could've at least given him a chance to redeem himself again with the next sequel. This film is doubtful to attract any new fans, but it shouldn't run off any die-hards either. It's engaging enough to sit through but certainly not memorable.

After Captain Jean-Luc Picard (Patrick Stewart) and his help manage to get him back to normal, they decide to explore the Ba'ku as well, finding that they are a race that regenerate and live in peace and harmony, rejecting technology, and with long lifespans. The Son'a are also studying the Ba'ku themselves, but leader Ad'har Ru'afo (Amadeus's F.

Rikkers attempt to rekindle an old romance with Counselor Troy comes off as a bit flat which is unfortunate as I wished I was seeing more of her on camera during this sequence and the whole movie.The plot itself is OK, but in my opinion the whiz bang special effects take too much away from the acting. The script for the actors relies too much on the action too. While it is a decent film, it is not good enough at pulling in & engaging the viewer to make it a better effort.

If this is a 10/10, then what would you give the Wrath of Kahn or Nemesis? Objectively, here are some points to consider.1) Film Stock It was shot of video and has the look and feel of a television episode.2) Cinematography The cinematography is poor and there was a good reason why the Oscar committee missed this one. Much of it could have been shot by your local film crew with tight closeups and uninspired pan sweeps.3) Special FX The CGI here is straight out of universal's boiler plate for the TV series. The CGI is cheap and uninspiring, especially for a feature film.4) Dialogue The dialogue is horrid, from the goofy reaction of Worf thoughts on breasts to Data's completely out of place comment on beards. Clearly Data has obtained no sense of style so why would we expect him to comment on it? 5) Story Premise The plot premise of having to remove the planets inhabitants to get access to the life extending radiation is absurd. It's a sparsely inhabited planet and has room for everyone. There would be no need to even settle next to the current inhabitants. Also, if you know about the radiation, why couldn't you reproduce it? Also, we have to believe that the Federation is complicit and that there is little honor among it's ranks. That's a completely cynical break from the whole history of the Federations prime directive and moral superiority. Shame on the writers and the audience who sucked that up without thought. If Picard is the last honorable officer left, then he might as well be Maqui. We might as well toss the whole Federation of planets. Firefly would be an example of a universe with a misguided and corrupt Federation. What makes Star Trek special is its optimism, something not found in most of this cynical plot.6) Screen Play Oh wait, everyone's safe, but we have to go back after the kid! I seriously got nauseated at this point. Was this written by a hack or did they run out of plot and need to talk on 15 minutes? So for all of you that enjoy baloney instead of steak. Eat up!

For seven years, it had been running in a sea of questionable credibility. With the original series creator Gene Roddenberry having died around the time that the sixth film rolled out, it would have been nice if they had just let the Federation ride off into the sunset. Sadly, Paramount and Viacom seem flatly determined to ride Star Trek and all associated with it into the ground.The rest of this comment might give something away regarding the plot.Insurrection, at its heart, concerns a planet where a strange type of radiation keeps the populace young. The Federation keeps a hidden research station on the planet to observe the effects and determine if this strange planetary feature can be used for their benefit. Elements within the Federation want to move the natives to a new place and seize this planet for themselves, regardless of the cost to said natives. I hope you got all of that, because the plot is virtually unrecognisable apart from those elements. At 103 minutes, Insurrection is the shortest Star Trek feature film to date, and it doesn't cope well with that. Padding a story is never a good idea, but then neither is telling a story that needed 120+ minutes to make full sense in 103. It isn't because the scenes are so long that they restrict their own ability to make sense (are you listening, Peter Jackson?). It's because the scenes are clipped to the point where cohesion and transition take a back seat to special effects and uninteresting battles.To the film's credit, the sequences with the refugees being pursued by drones has great dramatic tension. However, combat with warriors that have no personality can only take the impact so far. There is a human face on what Picard and company are fighting, but since it never leaves the starships in order to stand toe to toe with the heroes, it delivers little, if any, real impact. Compared to X-Men 2, where Patrick Stewart and Brian Cox make their sides painfully tangible simply by standing in the same room and having a conversation, Star Trek Insurrection, feels hopelessly flat.Another stretching of credibility on the part of the Star Trek screenwriters this invisible research station is sitting mere feet from the civilisation of these natives for an interminable amount of time. How long do you suppose it would be before a particularly curious or maniacal child climbs it, falls off it, and prompts his elders to start asking questions? To call Data's interference unnecessary is an understatement.The enemy in this film is barely quantifiable, so the battle for paradise seems more like a police action against insurgents. It is mainly for that reason that I felt Star Trek Insurrection, was worthy of a two out of ten.

While not the worst Star Trek film, it does have plenty of problems that stops it being better than it should be.  The main weakness is the plot which, at the start, is morally difficult.  I mean &#150; why wouldn't it make sense to move the Ba'ku and allow them to share the power of the planet with many millions of others and not just keep 500 alive forever?  This is nicely forgotten when the film decides it needs a bad guy and gives things over to the Son'a &#150; a good move in terms of creating a more action packed climax but a poor move in terms of plot logic.  The action is so-so allowing for battles in space and on the planet, but it is not as dramatic as I hoped with the planet based stuff taking away from the film and not being as dramatic as it could have been.The script does allow some witty moments but too often the dialogue is a bit ponderous, and there are no great lines or really memorable spells of dialogue or interaction.  The romance between Picard and Anij is a bit of a distraction, as is the stuff between Riker and Troy &#150; points of the film feel a bit more like a space soap/romance rather than sci-fi as I think of it.The cast are average.

The Baku - this wonderful, peace-loving people, who have such a strong cultural anathema to technology of any kind and who have gone to great lengths to avoid technology - certainly don't seem to have any moral dilemma about accepting Federation technology (replete with weapons and transporter inhibitors, etc.) when it suits their purposes. This culture gets shown to be hypocritical in the extreme. (If that was the point, I'd say it was well done, but I think Rick Berman and the screenwriters really want us to think of the Baku as anti-technology.) The movie would have had a greater sense of drama if Picard et. al. had had to fight against the wishes of the Baku themselves to try to save them (akin to what Kirk did on Organia in the original series.)And speaking of Picard, since when is he a lover of Latin music, to the point of dancing around in his cabin to it?

Let that not sound like a criticism, for it was not so much a film running through of any sort of formulae that induced this reaction; rather, it was the sense I got as to how distant it felt to that of the last entry 1996's wholly disappointing First Contact. For the record, First Contact was the first in this line of Star Trek films I did not especially take to, nor observe much therein to warrant a recommendation; but what director for that film and this one alike, Jonathan Frakes, has done is to correct each and all of both the problems and issues I had rear up in First Contact so as to allow for an enjoyable entry rich in mystery; adventure and that feeling one needs in films such as these that different worlds, times and the-like are actually being explored and engaged with.Granted, the opening sequence for this 1998 entry is straight out of Blue Velvet in tone and general aesthetic, but for all the meek complaints about how familiar it may or may not look, one cannot argue there is more of a sense of cinema at play in those opening few minutes than there was in the whole of 1996's aforementioned damp squib. Secondly, and where I was not at all fond of how Frakes created 2060's Planet Earth in First Contact (at no point did we get the feeling it was unfolding in an age of post-Nuclear War), amends have been made as to Insurrection's authenticity in that regard a genuine feeling that things are playing out on a planet we've never before seen featuring swaths of people undergoing their own cultural possessions authentically and defiantly. Gone too are the lousy Borg villains led by someone who looked more suited to being in Roger Vadim's sci-fi monstrosity Barberella, replaced by proper antagonists this time with principals; political motivations and actual menace. Like the best Star Trek films, this is about the adventures to worlds which exist within the minds of science fiction writers, although are quite fun to think might actually exist out there in the universe when we glance up at the sky on a clear night.The film depicts the on-going adventures of the new Generation of Enterprise commandeering folk, folk who took over from the crew that laid the foundation in the form of Shatner's Kirk et al. We begin with an appetiser featuring android of the series Data (Spiner) running amok during routine observation missions on a charted planet yet to fully bloom into a race of inter-planetary travelling people, events which will eventually lead to stalwart Picard flying out over there with his crew and check the place out. Initially, Patrick Stewart's Jean-Luc Picard is stuck in a procession of having to attend formal functions with other space creatures; forced into adhering to their strange cultures and coerced into being as polite as possible, even if it means donning odd clothing and having to learn alien languages he's never heard of. We used to be explorers, he mutters en route to yet another nullifying, humiliating evening of standing around and holding a glass of whatever in that way that's supposed to make you look cultured.In true Search for Spock fashion (still my favourite entry), after hearing of events involving his close non human-being counterpart that might very well affect their well-being on a grandiose scale, he slinks away illegally and off to the aforementioned planet to check things out. Once there, one of StarFleet's own in Anthony Zerbe's character says all the right things but leaves enough to be doubted, while F. Murray Abraham's bizarre creature Ru'afo reiterates said sensation out of the fact he just looks weird. Picard sticks around, and sure enough uncovers a fiendish plot to do with the eco-makeup of the planet which allows for certain fantastical things. Granted, the film has its roots in cinematic pop-culture (what with the scenes involving Picard and the natives striking us as Dances With Wolves-esque), while the overlying tract about certain people putting aside technological phobias and embracing machines too often reminds us of James Cameron's Terminator 2. Observe, if you will, the film's scenes between boy and machine and how they echo Furlong's own with Schwarzenegger's titular robot. Additionally, recall Sarah Connor's reaction to actually being granted the opportunity to destroy the allied T-800 in said film. Stopped by her own son, she comes to realise (epitomised by that handshake nearer the end) that there was indeed a place in their plight for this machine and that he served his purpose and served it well.In lining these up against First Contact's cinematic roots of inspiration (a sort of poor man's sci-fi Die Hard with a little bit of what constituted as an Alien sequel back then thrown in for bad measure), we observe plateaus of inspiration that are of an ilk requiring substance the bond between a man and a woman; the recognising of technology (or modernity) as an item one can fall back on, and not Grab the gun, run around, defeat the monsters. Frakes atones for the monstrosity that was First Contact with Insurrection, something he does so well that we forgive him for casting himself in a role that sees him get a spaceship dogfight manoeuvre named after him. The film is an enjoyable entry, authentic in its sets and setting; never bogged down like the last one often was and comes complete with a set of decent villains &#x96; recommended.

Picard (Patrick Stewart) and his crew aren't ready to succumb to Vice-Admiral Dougherty's (Anthony Zerbe) orders.While Insurrection is a decent movie, and possibly the most enjoyable Trek film up to this point -- not the best, but most enjoyable, there's a difference -- it feels more like an extended episode than a movie. Especially with Next Generation's habit of doing two-part episodes, there was nothing particularly epic about getting them to have one more mission, no more life-threatening than any other. (No Borg, no Dominion, no Malcolm MacDowell.) With the show over, though, the movies allow us to get updates on our favorite Trekkers, with direction from Jonathan Frakes. Riker (Frakes) with no beard again (showing how whipped he is)? Data's further quest to be human? Geordi (Levar Burton) with no visor (although one still wonders why blindness can't be fully corrected in this time period). I'm thankful for all this, and Nemesis... if they made another film, I'd be there quickly.Like many of the episodes, this one had an interesting question -- is technology harmful or helpful for society? I think the approach is rather black and white. One people have denied technology and another embraces it. But I wouldn't say one is better off than another. Not wishing to have bombs is one thing, but technology as a whole is only as good as those who use it.Insurrection will be enjoyed by the Trek fans, but it may not be the next step forward. Nothing really changes... in fact, you could skip this film and go to the next without having missed out on any plot. It's nice to see Picard with a romantic interest, but it doesn't really last.

It's been some sort of an asset (call it a curse) to the big-screen franchise that most odd-numbered Trek films are usually weak and unsatisfying, or at least fall short of the even-numbered one's that either preceded it or follows it. I wouldn't actually agree that all are bad (STAR TREK III THE SEARCH FOR SPOCK, which was one of these odd-numbered films, actually is among the very best in the series). But many of the films have been affected by this curse. Indeed, STAR TREK V and STAR TREK GENERATIONS, the latter being only disappointing but still.STAR TREK INSURRECTION is the 9th entry in the series (making it the 4th odd-numbered Trek), and the second directorial attempt by star Jonathan Frakes (STAR TREK FIRST CONTACT). And the signature shots of success from FIRST CONTACT are quite visible here. Frakes is still in control, and he still knows what made his previous Trek a wild success. INSURRECTION registers as another enjoyable action-packed entry in the franchise. The special effects, whilst not quite as convincing the likes of STAR WARS, are terrific. The action scenes are enjoyable, there's some decent acting, the scenery and photography are classy and good-looking. What the film lacks, however, is a more cohesive storyline.The plot, whilst confusing at first, turns pedestrian then on. A peaceful planet inhabited by a race of humans called the Ba'ku, living peacefully as an immortal race, is threatened by another alien race called So'na, led by its leader named Ru'afo (F. Murray Abraham), who wants to 'evacuate' the Ba'ku from their planet so that other systems can benefit from the planet's Fountain of Youth. Capt. Picard (Patrick Stewart) leads his crew and risks his career to try and save the Ba'ku from extinction. But the threat itself, the villains, aren't especially as threatening to say the least, not exactly as good as other villains (previously the Borgs from FIRST CONTACT) in the series. There are also a fairly weaker batch of characters that are rarely memorable nor special.Of the series, INSURRECTION is one of the weaker entries in the already long-running series, or the series that could follow. But, although mediocre, STAR TREK INSURRECTION is not without its pluses. Summer audiences could do no wrong with the action scenes and special effects, even of the film boldly goes where every summer audience has gone before. It's weak, but worthy.Rating *** out of 5.

And it may not be Frakes' fault, but some ST regulars have very little to do in this one. They mostly stand around.

There are intriguing plot points early on involving Starfleet's and the Federation's attitude towards relocation of colonists, an obvious parallel to our 19th century approach towards American Indians. It's another take on the oft-used phrase 'the needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few' (or the one), and points out that the Federation is still far from perfect even in the 24th century, riddled with bureaucracy and policies based on expediency. I'm not sure this is what Roddenberry had in mind when he conceived the whole Trek universe, which seemed a bit more evolved in comparison to our current approach on the political front. There are also brief references to other problems plaguing the Federation of this time frame, related to the Borg threat and the Dominion war. These are nice nods to continuity but, again, creates a very unpleasant picture of what we used to think of as a solid framework for near-utopia and the grand notion of exploration. Even actor Stewart's character Capt. Picard addresses this briefly, when he wonders out-loud on whatever happened to their status as explorers. What, indeed.Instead, we are treated to what amounts to a double-length episode of the TNG series - just another standard mission - and not a very exciting one, at that. The plot revolves around two sets of peoples introduced here the pleasant Ba'ku and the unpleasant Son'a. The Ba'ku, which number about 600, have really lucked out they settled a planet about 300 years ago whose planetary rings have extraordinary properties in terms of halting the aging process. Based on the exposition, these Ba'ku kind of sound to me like people who escaped Earth's 3rd World War in the 21st century. They have knowledge of advanced technology such as holograms but choose to spend their time in pre-industrial farming techniques; it's basically a return-to-nature scenario. The Son'a, on the other hand, indulge in grotesquely extreme plastic surgery to fend off advancing years and are understandably temperamental due to all the skin stretching. Their technology is, in some ways, even more advanced than the Federation's and they covet what the Ba'ku have (naturally nice skin). At least one Starfleet admiral agrees with the Son'a that the benefits of these planetary rings should be spread around more and so, an underhanded plan ensues. There's an unintentional amusing tone to this set-up, dark as it is, slipping nearly into satire, almost as bad as the silliness in the 5th film, The Final Frontier. Of course, when Picard learns of this unscrupulous plot against the Ba'ku, he will have none of it, and this at least puts us all back on track in terms of Federation principles and the well-known honor of the TNG crew. There are some nice bits related to the crew becoming somewhat rejuvenated while on this planet, some of it amusing (Worf), some poignant (LaForge's eyes) and some satisfying (Riker & Troi). Some other stuff is just too silly - the extended scene of Picard & Data singing an old Broadway tune (stop, please, stop). There are also very cliché sequences - Data's developing friendship with a Ba'ku boy; the entire 'boy-goes-back-for-pet' scene, resulting in jeopardy for the adults who follow him. Taken together, these add up to a ho-hum adventure, as if the writers were simply caught without any really new ideas. I really wish these Trek films would've concentrated on something unusual and extraordinary happening to the characters, rather than following the week-to-week pattern of an episodic series. Since way back to The Wrath of Khan, the Trek films had pretty much avoided the central theme of the original and Next Generation series, that being seeking out new lifeforms and civilizations. Unfortunately, though there is a limp attempt at this here, what they found here was nothing new, but more of the same. It's a nice, pleasant revisit with the crew, as well as a retread of the issues presented in the original series episode The Omega Glory from 30 years prior and TNG's own Journey's End in its last season.

When considering the essence of these films, a certain degree of formulation can be constructed in regard to the perfect film. Irrelevant of which crew, whether Picard or Kirk led, the truly great films are those which have action, a decent plot, banter amongst the crew, enough scenes involving the ship and an amazing enemy. In Star Trek II The Wrath Of Khan we had all of these points, the same being true of The Undiscovered Country and First Contact. With this ninth encounter however, we are given a film full of crew banter, a decent plot and action, but for the majority of the time the story is set on a planet and the enemy is actually rather pathetic.In Star Trek Insurrection, Captain Picard travels to an area of space known as the Briar Patch to retrieve Commander Data. Data, who's actions are eventually explained, has gone berserk attacking a Federation outpost as they study a supposedly Prewarp society. When Picard arrives however, he is confronted with a conflict between Federation Orders and a peaceful society which simply wishes to exist. Forced to choose between duty and morality, Picard chooses the obvious answer and sets forth to protect the peaceful Baku from the evil Sonar.If the previous formula of plot + banter + ship + enemy + action decent film is correct, then the only way to analyse Star Trek Insurrection is to consider whether it fills these categories.Firstly, this film succeeds because it actually has quite a decent plot. By considering the moral implications of an action and having the Federation being on the negative side, it succeeds in making us support Picard's rebellious tendencies. At the same time as this, we are presented to Riker and Troi's blossoming relationship as the two accept their mistakes and link up again. Returning to where they were when the very first episode of the series was shown, these two characters have always meant to be together and this episode's actions lead on nicely to the wedding in the next film. Finally on a plus point, for one brief spell, the ship and action combine themselves well in the assault by the Sonar. Whilst this scene is slightly ridiculed by Riker's use of a joystick to control an enormous ship, in general the mammoth fight scene with the Enterprise being attacked is monumental in that we finally get to see the ship in action.This film has a decent plot, a lot of banter and the occasional bit of action and starship combat, that's a plus side. Sadly however, Star Trek Insurrection has some key problems.Firstly, and admittedly this isn't on the formula for a successful film, Insurrection is just too nice. The Baku live in a form of paradise, and the way Picard stands up for them is brilliantly written. At the same time though, it feels like they need a dark side. When considering the film viewing audience, everyone loves a hero. We all love that this person will risk their neck to do what's right. At the same time though, we like the hero and the culture they fight for, to have a negative point to them. If you consider films like Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom (1984), the plot is destroyed by the fact that the people Indiana saves are ridiculously nice and appear to have no flaws. In this film the problem is the same. The Baku are a warm, friendly, intelligent, artistic community, but we never learn of their flaws. We never learn of how they were once fools who made countless mistakes and learn from them. Instead of this, we hear that the Baku are just really nice people who want to live a simple life and enjoy themselves. The point is that nobody would deny a happy life to anyone, but it's always nice to hear of a perfect persons failings. If the Baku, or anyone for that matter, is too nice, they just sound pretentious and the viewer looses a sense of connection and develops a desire to kick them in the teeth.Another problem with Star Trek Insurrection is that, as an enemy, the Sonar are just not that good. These whining babies, who have a secret past, spend their entire time trying to steal from the Baku in the meanest possible way. The Sonar remind us of the bully in the school ground who beat up the weakest children out of spite for their parents treating them better than the bully's parents have. They just aren't appealing.To summarise Star Trek Insurrection, it doesn't quite fit the formula. Whilst Rick Berman (writer) has noticed the beauty of the banter between cast and crew, he never really gets the film right with the enemy. If we were to use the potential formula for Star Trek films, then this film has a decent space battle scene, a lot of banter between the crew, and a decent plot. On a downside however, the enemy is a pathetic, waste of space, who needs to grow up, and the Baku, the people Picard tries to save, are just far too nice to really be attached to. Like so many episodes of Star Trek Voyager, this film's peaceful Baku give the impression that they paint their walls pink and ignore the fact that anything bad happens in the world. Star Trek Insurrection could have been good, but it falls hideously short of standards.

For whatever reason, INSURRECTION 'feels' like a minor television episode of 'ST The Next Generation', and is that most unforgivable of faults, a totally forgettable experience.Reviving the old chestnut about the search for 'the Fountain of Youth', the film further erodes the frequently-ignored Prime Directive, as the Federation, influenced by dermatological-challenged alien, Ahdar Ru'afo (F. Murray Abraham, nearly unrecognizable), moves ahead to evict a nearly immortal civilization from their homeworld, just to provide a select few an opportunity to enjoy the planet's unique gifts. A happy, contented species living at peace in a 'Walden'-like setting has always unnerved the Galactic Overloads, ever since the original 'Trek' series of the sixties (as Kirk used to put it, A Society without Ambition will stagnate and die...) Of course, our stalwarts of the Enterprise end up on the planet, with the expected results; Picard gets a girlfriend, Data bonds with a boy, Worf gets zits, Riker and Troi get frisky (and he decides to shave off his signature beard), and Beverly Crusher enjoys her newly swelling breasts. That the characters still look the same as all this is happening might tend to make one feel that the changes are more psychological than actual, but this is an concept we are not supposed to consider. As the 'truth' about Ru'afo is revealed, his nefarious plan becomes obvious, and Picard and Company must stand against the Federation, and protect the inhabitants...which gives the film it's title, but little in the way of dramatic impact. Yes, another Enterprise is trashed and lives are threatened (Riker on a joystick, controlling the remains of the starship, brings unintentional laughs, and Data's butt comment, embarrassed ones), but the end result is neither suspenseful nor exhilarating. This is the kind of film where you check your watch, to see how much time you've wasted...not a good sign for ANY film, and disastrous when viewing a 'Star Trek' movie.As fans again pointed to the 'Odd/Even' theory of 'Star Trek' films, there was the hope that the next film, NEMESIS, being even-numbered, would be great, and renew the series' vision...but this was a standard that was about to collapse...

Focus is spread from the Data/Picard emphasis in the last two films, and we get to see some of the long lost TNG gems re-emerge (The pre emotion-chip Data, Riker/Troi relationship, etc).  Overall, I felt the film made the most of a seemingly less earth shaking storyline (borg invasion, death of Kirk) and in doing so returned us to the softer and more humanitarian side of Star Trek that many have come to know and love.  Make no mistake, though, those who are looking for another action packed, effects-heavy film will find plenty to love in Star Trek VIV.

DULL!!Lord what an inconsequential movie. It seems at times to be leading up to something, but it never does...oh gee, they stop an 'invasion fleet' of 3 ships, peopled by F. Murray Abraham's old farts. Yay. What is it with these guys, can't they come up with something that Moves, or that you care about? Star Trek 8 was at least Kinda interesting(Borg stuff usually is...)but this...they go and save a bunch of over aged Boy Scouts in the mountains. So what? Episodes of Space 1999 had more resonance folks...My thinking is that they should just Let things go for a while, drop the series and films for about 5 years, come up with some New ideas, producers, writers, etc. and then give it another whack then. As it stands right now, it is a tired series, about done its run...what made Babylon Five good was that thew knew when to quit, 5 years, and Trek just won't. And its Showing its age guys, big time; better bring it to a halt before we get another travesty like Star Trek V....

While this film is not a great Star Trek film and quickly fades from your mind after you see it, it is still a well-made movie and is worth a look--especially if you've already invested your time in seeing the other films of the series.In this film, the Federation, very uncharacteristically, makes a dirty deal with one race from one planet to wipe out another on another planet and colonize it for themselves. The crew of the Enterprise is shocked this could have occurred, but since they are the ultimate arbiters of the Prime Directive, they come to the aid of the beleaguered natives.It's nice to see Anthony Zerbe in the film. He was a perennial slime-ball character actor from the 60s and 70s that hasn't been seen very much in recent years. "}{"Title":"I wish they'd stop letting these @#$%! TV writers write movies!","Date":"1 January 1999","Score":"0 out of 4 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi","Review":"  Once again the ST faithful are subjected to a fair-to-middling two-hour television episode. I wish to God they'd stop letting these TV writers write these movies. The movie takes no chances; not for one second do I feel that anyone is in danger. Ugh--I give this one a begrudging 5. Better than Generations, and about as bad as First Contact.At least I'm glad I paid matinee prices. I'd hate this movie a lot if I had paid eight bones to see it. I'll never pay to see it on video though. I've paid my Trekkie dues to keep the franchise going one more time. But I swear, if I smell another TV episode coming in the next one, I won't bother going.
