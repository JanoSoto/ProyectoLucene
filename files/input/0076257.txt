Watching it twenty-five years later, I'm still amazed that any studio actually gave the go-ahead to this shameless eruption of outrageous bad taste, politically incorrect madness and outright lunacy. It's the kind of film everyone would like to make if they had the money and the resources, and then proudly show off to their friends over beer and Pringles whilst beaming Ain't I a genius?! Honestly, it's that good.The Zucker brothers were obviously highly influenced by the Monty Python way of thinking (though without the benefit of an Oxbridge education), and it shows in segments like 'AM Today', 'Death Appeal', the interview where the microphone grabs all the attention, 'Danger Seekers' (not for the easily offended, but it cracks me up every time), the courtroom sketch and the central 'A Fistful Of Yen' spoof, which rips into every chop-socky film ever made, and even finds room to spoof the Wizard Of Oz...like I said, Good GOD! Another unforgettable sketch is the soft-porn parody 'Catholic High School Girls In Trouble', if only for that jaw-dropping scene with Uschi Digart (credited here as Ursula Digard) in the shower, and the corny-but-hysterical Marilyn Chambers recreating her classic role / roll quickie.A barrel full of laughs.

The film is very 70s--some of the references won't make any sense to anyone born after 1977.  Also much of the humor is exceptionally crude and there's a huge overabundance of gratuitious female nudity and fairly graphic sex.  This film wouldn't be made today and would easily have gotten an NC-17 rating if it had.  Still, the film is often hilarious--I laughed myself silly at some of the crudest humor possible.

A string of politically incorrect segments made by the creators of Airplane! and The Naked Gun, KFM is an R-rated romp that today, nearly 30 years after its release, would be too shocking to even warrant the dreaded NC-17 rating. Forget those unfunny amateurs Broken Lizard or the overrated Farrelly Brothers. We're talking naked breasts, oral sex, racial slurs, violence... and yet each segment leaves you delirious from not only laughter but disbelief at the fact that the Zuckers actually go away with all this. I've discovered that it really takes a certain kind of innocence to make a movie like KFM, a naive belief that people will simply laugh at the crude spectacle of it all. Segments include a wholesome couple listening to a 1950s style how-to record on foreplay (wait till you see what the record comes equipped with), a thrill seeker whose trademark stunt is going to a crowd of black men and yelling out the N-word (how bold is this scene? No one has dared imitate it since), and a political debate between two analysts that ends with one of them cheerfully telling the other to blow it out your a** and giving them the finger. The highlight is the mini-movie within the movie, A Fistful of Yen. A parody of all the Bruce Lee films, its hero, Loo, fights the evil Klahn, a one-armed criminal mastermind with a fondness for the phrase extraordinary magnitude. It also pokes fun at the endless fights from the Lee films, as well as the characters' fractured English (little trivia, the actors really were Asian and spoke poor English in real life, so it wasn't intentional on their parts) The twist ending of Yen is one of the goofiest things you ever saw in your life. Despite the often offensive humor of KFM, it's not a mean film by any means. No one is really safe from the wacky chaos it inflicts, and it's just hilarious. In our time of hand-wringing political correctness, KFM offers a cathartic experience of laughing out loud at our fears, prejudices, and, yes, stupidity. This is indeed a finger-lickin' good comedy.

Finally I just picked it up off E-Bay (which I should have done from the start, of course) and watched it for the first time in years last night.In terms of laughs per minute, this one is a strong contender for funniest movie of all time. Written by Zucker Abraham and Zucker, directed by John Landis, and produced by Samuel L Bronkowitz (just kidding), The Kentucky Fried Movie is really nothing more than a collection of skits, barely connected by the convention that they're all things you might see on TV (or at the movies). But, oh, the skits. Let's just say that no single episode of Saturday Night Live was ever this funny.Best of the bunch is the movie's centerpiece, A Fistful of Yen, a dead-on parody of kung fu action movies a la Enter The Dragon. In this bit, the longest in the film, a Bruce Lee type named Loo has to infiltrate a mountain fortress run by the villainous Dr. Klahn, who is building an army of extraordinary magnitude. The martial arts scenes are hilarious; it may be the most staged-looking fighting of all time. Beginning with Loo training other fighters (What was that? This is not a chawade. We need total concen-TWAY-tion, he yells at one student) and ending with Loo finally going home (in a completely out-of-left-field ending having nothing to do with the previous action but seeming somehow fitting anyway), the slapstick jokes come fast and furious, even parodying The Dating Game at one point. This is a direct precursor to ZAZ's later movies like Airplane! and The Naked Gun.Then there's the incredible Catholic High School Girls in Trouble, which aims to parody 70s porno flicks (More shocking than 'Behind the Green Door'... Never before has the beauty of the sexual act been so crassly exploited! the announcer screams.) To get an idea of the kind of humor seen here, picture a hot chick approaching a loser and saying in a breathy voice Show me your nuts! and the guy proceeding to start acting like a total loon. In United Appeal for the Dead Henry Gibson speaks at great length about death, the number one killer in the United States, and what his group can do to help a loved one who has died lead a normal life. That's Armageddon features George Lazenby and parodies every Irwin Allen disaster flick made. A young man and woman discover the pleasures of sex through an instructional record in Sex Record, and Courtroom is a hilarious parody of courtroom melodramas featuring Wally (the real Tony Dow) and the Beav (Jerry Zucker mugging it up in place of Jerry Mathers) as observers. The movie begins and ends with two news-themed skits, AM Today and the racy Eyewitness News, in which the newscasters watch a couple with the TV on having sex. And there's much more.The Kentucky Fried Movie is not for all tastes; I've known people who have watched it and just said This is stupid. It is, indeed, stupid, but within the confines of the genre, it's one of the best. You'll laugh at the stupid jokes and stupid puns and stupid lines and stupid stunts all the way through if you like this sort of thing. The movie is very clever in how it packs the laughs.

He confesses that he really has nothing to say and can't think of anything so he just apologizes to Korean movie fans for not making any sense and just babbling in Korean.

In a panic, he hopped into his limo, and with a few production personnel, drove around the Chinatown and Central City area of Los Angeles looking for extras to round out the shoot. The Chinese he approached on the sidewalks and storefronts of Chinatown all refused his offer of work, and the entourage proceeded westward aimlessly. After a short while, they came upon the Belmont High School football field, which at the time was filled with members of the track team warming down from their workouts. One of the captains of the team, Carlos Mancilla, by coincidence,a Black Belt in Martial Arts, was approached by Landis, who explained his predicament. Carlos, who had helped make and participate in student films at the time, and whose schoolmates at the time were future playwright Lemar Fooks, and the future Rosarita Food Company spokeswoman, Sergia Sanchez, and whose teacher at the time was Tom Waits father, Frank Waits, immediately picked up on the problem. He put the call out to the Chinese Friendship Club, the tennis team, and select members of the track team that had some knowledge of Martial Arts, and within 30 minutes, Landis had his Martial Arts army. Needless to say, the sequence was a success, all because of the fortuitous meeting between John Landis and one of his future extras, Carlos Mancilla. Mancilla later sought out a career in movie production, both as a set-builder and bit player, with which he is still involved in. Incidentally, Mancilla founded a service which helped provide Hollywood productions with Biker and Gang Type extras. Some of the films he provided Bikers and 'Cholos' for, were, Back to the Future, Part 2, American Me, and Mi Vida Loca.

As was exacerbated in the writers' next effort, the aforementioned Airplane!, the visual gags are sometimes quite brilliant. I first came across this film when I was quite young. I'm not really sure how this would be viewed today. As I mentioned, this is very much a part of the 1970's.

Then do yourself a great favor and buy,rent or borrow Kentucky Fried Movie and take yourself into a time when filmmakers had the guts to try new,different and very risky things! All for the better too because there's a place for well formed & written comedy but there's also a need for the truly outlandish and just downright silly and insane! You think There's Something About Mary and American Pie are the originators of the kind of humor that the squeamish run from? Not by a long shot their not.Just before this movie was The Groove Tube which was just as wild,I'm sure John Landis (the man who brought you Animal House & other great comedy capers)was inspired by that film to try this as well.While the opening A.M. Today segment is not as funny as the rest,it's amusing enough a start to lead into the funnier comedy moments. The R-rated style commercial parodies and the movie trailer for Catholic High School Girls In Trouble. (Don't worry ladies & gentleman,these fully undressed ladies look far too old for high school or even college!) These are classic and hilarious,unless you're the most uptight person on the face of the earth.The extended segment Fist Full Of Yen,a Bruce Lee movie parody is excellent as well,where in the opening shot it says Hong Kong over a shot of New York (Twin Towerspresent and all). The hero takes on what seems like a hundred challengers and beats them all! More absurd movie trailers & commercials follow returning us to the ongoing news segment that leads to the very creative and well timed closing segment.Safe to say,not everyone likes this kind of a movie with it's open nudity,sexuality and almost high schoolish humor but apart from those ideals is very well staged and funny comedy segments. These make SNL & MAD TV look tame by comparison. Given how America's overall tastes have changed a great deal the people who would enjoy this will by,again,getting the movie and watching at their leisure. Those who wouldn't want to even be in the same room as the DVD/VHS tape,will never relent or even try and have the open mind to watch it. People that consider this mindless will never understand all that went into making the film to start with. Mainly,the overall risk involved in the first place but then again...what fun is life without risk?

There's great mileage in a steamy preview of Catholic High School Girls in Trouble, starring fictitious Linda Chambers (no prizes for guessing the amalgam) daring one stud to show her his nuts, with an hilarious response. Some audiences might also recognise the amply attributed Uschi Digart in a prolonged shower scene, while Donald Sutherland, Henry Gibson and Bill Bixby bring some A-list credibility to bear in speedy cameos.There's a couple of minor misfires, and it's certainly not suitable for kids but generally speaking, this is one of the most consistently hilarious films I've ever had the pleasure of watching - over and over again for the last twenty-something years.

This movie functions as a hysterical spoof of any kind of programming one might see in the theaters or on TV at the time. And, as has been said, this is definitely a product of its era. Younger viewers may not get a good deal of the jokes. But, overall, The Kentucky Fried Movie is wild stuff with the Z.A.Z. team throwing all caution to the wind and coming up with some wonderfully raunchy and outrageous stuff. There's no real through line, merely a succession of parodies. The centerpiece is a lengthy Enter the Dragon mockery titled A Fistful of Yen which has hero Loo (Evan C. Kim) hired to infiltrate the criminal empire of a man named Dr. Klahn, played by Master Bong Soo Han. Some of the Z.A.Z. team's jokes may tend towards the crude and immature, but it's such a hoot that they just throw so much stuff at us (much like Airplane! three years later). The pacing slows a bit during A Fistful of Yen but otherwise things move along quite well. TV commercials for such things as oil, zinc oxide, board games, and beer dot the busy landscape, along with spoofs of black & white courtroom shows, disaster movies, and jabs at news programming. The mock sexploitation trailer Catholic High School Girls in Trouble and blaxploitation trailer Cleopatra Schwartz provide some of the brightest moments, and provide PLENTY of eye candy guaranteed to make many viewers happy. The feel-a-round segment is particularly funny, using director John Landis's recurring See You Next Wednesday in-joke (and featuring a poster of his debut movie, Schlock). Special guest appearances are made by such famous faces as Tony Dow from 'Leave It to Beaver', one time James Bond player George Lazenby, the great Donald Sutherland, and TV veterans Bill Bixby and Henry Gibson. Fans of 70's trash cinema will also note the presence of Marilyn Joi (as Ms. Schwartz), Tara Strohmeier, Lenka Novak, and well endowed Uschi Digard. Zucker, Abrahams, and Zucker themselves appear throughout, makeup effects legend Rick Baker is the gorilla, Landis the TV technician thrown by the gorilla, and future Airplane! cast members Stephen Stucker and Leslie Nielsen (uncredited) are utilized as well. This is genuinely great, unrestrained material that makes a number of comedies in the years since look bland in comparison. Highly recommended to fans of sketch comedy. Eight out of 10.

One can compare this film to Monty Python genre.  Keep the kids out of the room for this one.  If Saturday Night Live has been a regularly watched piece, than this will not be too offensive.  It remains, however, a somewhat lewd cinema in a few places, so an R rating is highly recommended.  Still in all it is worth the effort to watch.  I give it an 8 only in comparison to flicks of the same genre.  It is not a classic.

Kentucky Fried Movie, the little movie that could, delivers it. Regrettably, its successor Airplane! didn't.  Both movies were made by the famous comedy moviemakers David Zucker, Jim Abrahams and Jerry Zucker, best known as ZAZ.  Kentucky Fried Movie, or KFM as it is known, was directed by John Landis, who went to big projects as Animal House and The Blues Brothers.  As a small movie, KFM would pave the way for the filmmakers successes.  But in DVD terms, KFM did a much better job than Airplane! with extras aplenty.  Airplane! only had a trailer and ZAZ's mediocre commentary track, which ZAZ did much better in KFM.  As for KFM's extras, they included a hilarious 8-minute home movie which ZAZ proved to their relatives they were making a real movie in Hollywood, a clear-cut photo gallery, bios of ZAZ and John Landis, and the best commentary track they have done so far.As for KFM, what makes this small movie so special?  Although much of the movie is done tastelessly, it is fun tastelessness that everyone in it is enjoying it.  There is a lot of nudity and foul language, but it had it's heart in the right place.  And as for the cast, there are mostly unknown actors, and many of them are quite attractive and talented, with cameos by more famous actors such as the late Bill Bixby in a headache sketch, Donald Sutherland as a clumsy waiter in a sketch spoofing disaster movies, and Leave it to Beaver stars Jerry Mathers and Tony Dow kidding themselves as bickering brother jurors in the courtroom sketch.This movie, I think, is the best spoof of pop culture I've ever seen, outdoing its predecessor The Groove Tube, made 3years earlier than KFM and featuring bits by a then-unknown and pre-Saturday Night Live Chevy Chase. One of my favorite skits are A.M. Today with a gorilla rampaging the studio, scaring off everyone, while a calm anchorwoman (played by the lovely little-known actress Janice Kent)continues her duties of reporting the news. Another favorite isSex Records, with a black couple being instructed on lovemaking by a record until the woman is whisked away by a black muscleman, Yet another favorite is Feel-A-Round, where a theatre usher listens to the dialogue of a movie, gets out his props to feel a movie goer, even scaring him with a knife when the actress announces she'll cut up her lover with a knife. Then there is the final skit where a newsman from TV has the power to peer into the living room of a young couple having sex, and his crew (well-played by ZAZ themselves) leer on.  But the best sketch of all is A Fistful of Yen, a 17-minute takeoff of Bruce Lee Movies featuring a lisping Karate champ fighting against the master despot Dr. Klahn, who wants to take over the world, and ends with the Hero in Dorothy drag spoofing The Wizard of Oz.If you like your DVDs, and of a low-budget movie, KFM delivers the goods.  Hopefully, there will be a special edition of Airplane! in the future for fans of that movie who were disappointed in the DVD treatment of that great classic , but let's not hold our breaths.  But for ZAZ fans, KFM was the best DVD work they have done so far, and it's a special edition in its own right, outshining and outselling Airplane! by a substantial margin.

If you see this for the first time when you're thirteen years old, I guess Catholic High School Girls In Trouble stays with you for a long time! Of course, as a Brit, a lot of American-TV inspired gags went over one's head, but it was still the funniest film I'd ever seen up to that point.I saw it again years later, and of course I look on it with affection rather than still finding it a comedy masterpiece. One thing did improve however - in the interim I had actually watched Enter The Dragon, so A Fistful of Yen (which was funny anyway) became ten times funnier, and pointed up the gag at the end when it turns into the Wizard of Oz. Some time later I bought The Groove Tube (1974) on VHS, and discovered that the idea of having a 10+ minute movie spoof in the middle of your sketch show had originated with Ken Shapiro's less-known semi-laughfest. Groove Tube's movie spoof, however, was of the Cheech & Chong drug culture movie, which never really became as much a part of the zeitgeist as Kung Fu movies have, which may explain why KFM was so much more successful than Tube.As Monty Python discovered (twice), it is impossible to maintain laughs throughout the entire length of a sketch-based movie, and the best idea is to try and put your weakest material during the sag at minutes 50 to 70, then slam them with the best, funniest stuff for the climax. Zucker, Abrahams, Zucker and Landis *almost* pulled it off, but the fact is the courtroom sketch just contains too much silliness and becomes tiresome, leaving you a little listless for the final sketch about the TV newsreaders watching the young lovers - which in any case was an exploitation sketch designed to get the boobage count up. It's moderately funny to see a large sex toy in the serious surroundings of a court. Having the defence council pretend that the object in question is growing out of his head just looks childish.Some have commented on their disappointment with this movie, given the calibre of the team associated with it. But in fact they've got it the wrong way round. Back in 1977/78, this was funny, original stuff, and when Airplane came round a few years later with the names Zucker, Abrahams and Zucker attached, it was then we knew to expect quality comedy. KFM was their first time out, and they did a pretty good job, considering.

Rather, the skits tend to have an almost sweet tone about them. They employ humor and gags not intended to offend, though they might, if handled by other writers, as the content can be pretty darned provocative.Coming from me, this should mean a lot. My very own mother is depicted in the most-memorable Catholic High School Girls in Trouble segment Mrs. Burke -- from the 1968 POST Grape-Nuts commercial -- played here by Gwen Van Dam. (You can see the real Mrs. Burke at the Burke Family Grape-Nuts Archives)As the son of a most virtuous Catholic mother, herself quite unlike the character in this film, I might easily be offended. Yet, in this case, I feel honored to see my mom's name roll in the credits of this clever flick.Many of the skits are excellent. The much praised piece, A Fistful of Yen (the spoof on Bruce Lee's classic Enter the Dragon), is so well done, it truly merits the distinction, a must see.I would certainly recommend this film to any adult who is not likely to be offended by nudity and sexual themes.

The only one I actually fast-forwarded through was the Courtroom, which was truly dull.All the humour is pretty laboured and juvenile, and I don't mean in a rude/funny way - but in a really-weak-pun sort of way.Watch Amazon Women On The Moon instead - or again, if it's a choice between that and KFM.

I can't believe the KFM filmmakers actually had the cluelessness to include a Point/Counterpoint satire when Dan Ackroyd's and Jane Curtin's (much funnier) version of the same joke was already well on its way to a permanent position in the pop culture canon by this point.I actually thought the movie improved somewhat during the Kung Fu satire. A bit of extended narrative allowed a little more of the classic Naked Gun/Airplane style humor to seep through and I actually found myself laughing occasionally during this bit. By contrast, earlier skits like Feel-around were about as entertaining as watching the farm report.There were a few funny bits after A Fistful of Yen (gee, what a hilarious, satirical title!); I especially liked Scot Free and was mystified that more of those skits weren't placed up at the front of the movie, but by the time we got into the crashingly unfunny Courtroom bit I was ready to pop this DVD out of the player and move on to something else.

I'm sure back then the kind of comedy on offer here would be considered cutting edge, but this is 2002 and a thousand other spoof films have come and gone.If this film had been released today I have no doubt that it would debut on rental and probably star a washed up Leslie Neilsen as the TV anchorman. You see, because this is my first viewing of the film and I have seen a ton of similar films in my life, this formerly cutting edge film seems as innovative as the next Meg Ryan romcom.That's not to say there isn't any laughs to be had, some of the skits are indeed quite amusing. The parts I enjoyed most were the spoof of the early morning magazine show with the rampaging gorilla and the Death Society. The spoofs come thick and fast, apart from a tortuously long take on 70's kung fu films. This is the films longest skit and unfortunately the one most devoid of laughs. Sure, it was probably a laugh riot in the 70's when Kung Fu films were all the rage, but today it just seems tired.A lot of the skits are just poor and it's no fault of the amount of similar films I've seen, the jokes just fall flat. The film is a mixture of the completely unfunny, the mildly amusing, but I've seen it a bunch of times and the pretty damn hilarious. Alas, the former two take up the lion share of the screen time and the short running time feels about twice as long.I could go on and talk about the standard of acting and direction, etc., but there really is no point as both actors and director are not given enough time in each skit to show their worth. Indeed, the only actors I recognised were failed Bond George Lazenby and Mr. you-wouldn't-like-me-when-I'm-angry Bill Bixby. It's a cast of unknowns for the most part, which I guess works in the films favour as you concentrate more on the jokes.When it comes down to it though The Kentucky Fried Movie is an incredibly mixed bag that fails through no fault of it's own.

V., television appeals and of course there is the sex. It's all so pre-PC, so care-free in its stance that it even, after all these years, has its laugh-out-loud moments and, also, its cringe worthy moments too, it hasn't aged all that well in presentation but the upbeat and, in today's perspective, daring gags still works well. We can, now in hindsight, see the fruitiness of this up and coming team of David Zucker, Jim Abrahams and Jerry Zucker, unfortunately, at the time, no one else could or would.It may be best to see this first venture sooner than its latter contenders, for it may take the shine off this work, you see, it had virtually no budget, even at an average $600,000 - $1,000,000 this was such a minuscule amount. Taking into account the despairing production and excessive amateurish feel, it was a highly successful Independent movie that grossed some several million dollars in return. It seemed that this was to be a fruitful venture after all, as with the televisions' sketches; this too, had big names dropping in, names such as George (James Bond) Lazenby, Bill (The Incredible Hulk) Bixby, Henry Gibson and Donald Sutherland to add a little weight to the proceedings. It also has the sense and style of Monty Pythons great parody sketch film of 1971 And Now for Something Completely Different. On account, The Kentucky Fried Movie may have been seen much too late in the running order of things, been around the block, established itself as a cult status and given a healthy return, but, on first impressions it is dated, it is basic and it is crude to say the least. On reflection it is also fun, it is, or was, also that little bit daring and it is a respectable and honourable piece of work, that a bunch of people had believability in and took the chance, and won. Very impressionable.

The Kentucky Fried Movie is a mess, a sketch comedy in which the laughs are few and far between. Watching this is an exercise in tedium, never more so than during the feature presentation dropped into the middle of the movie, a 30-minute martial arts parody which is an interminable bore. The best you can say for the majority of the other sketches is at least they're mercifully brief, some only a few seconds long and none more than five or six minutes in length. So at least if you don't like what you're seeing at a given moment, and way more often than not you won't, you know there will be something entirely different coming right up soon enough. But then inevitably that next sketch starts and it's lousy too and on and on and on we go. Somebody make it stop please.If you hold out any hope that the movie is ever going to gather any momentum at all the endless martial arts sequence kills that idea, bringing the movie to a dead stop. After that the movie crawls toward a merciful end. The last few sketches actually aren't half bad. There are some genuine laughs to be had there. But by that point you're so beaten down by all the miserable stuff you've been forced to sit through you can't fully appreciate it when you finally do see something funny. By the time you get to those last few sketches this movie has long since been doomed to failure. The writers threw a lot of garbage at the wall to see what would stick and very little did. About the best thing that can be said about this movie is that you're glad it exists because if it didn't there'd be no Airplane! But I'd watch Airplane! approximately 3,637 more times before I'd ever think of watching The Kentucky Fried Movie again.

It is merely a series of spoof sketches with no discernable connection.The film is typical of the spoofs from these guys, they are all packed with jokes that are very scattergun - the hope being that the hits will allow the audience to overlook the misses.  This worked well with such hits as Airplane and Naked Gun but this is simply not as funny as those.  Some of the sketches have clever or amusing but most are boring or simply miss the mark - the whole martial arts bit is unfunny and drags on for ages, whereas the Jewishploitation film trailer is weirdly funny but seconds long.The problem is that not only are the jokes scattergun but the whole film is.  Airplane never had a great plot - but it at least had a framework  to set the jokes within.  Here there is no thread running through the sketches much less a plot! This creates the feeling that whole sections of the film are misses, rather than just jokes.Bottom line - it's not funny.  For many of the sketches you can see why they SHOULD be funny and you can imagine them being a good ideas at the time - but the vast majority of the jokes are misses.From the people who made the hilarious Airplane, this is a major disappointment.

The laughs never stop throughout, and the fact that many of the jokes are about issues current to 1977 makes it even more funny.There is nothing whatsoever Politically Correct about KFM, and so expect to see many jokes and issues that will offend someone somewhere.The movie is ingeniously crafted as well. Instead of just beginning and ending with a feature film, as movies do, instead the audience is treated to a series of film shorts collected together to appear as if we are watching television at home. In this long list are fake commercials, talk shows, news briefs, daredevil shows, random one-off gags, and the feature presentation a spoof of Enter the Dragon starring a very young Evan Kim who later appeared in Dirty Harry The Dead Pool. This is utterly hilarious, as is the movie in its entirety.This is the first example of quick humor I ever saw, outside of the Three Stooges. It is basically slapstick humor, and has a lot in common with newer comedy like South Park, simply in the timing and presentation of the jokes.Well worth watching over and over and over again, especially with a group of friends.

But while being on the big screen means the film can go a lot further than Saturday NIGHT LIVE ever could on television, KFM doesn't have the same level of talent behind it. When you add in the dated quality of the humor, the result is very hit or miss indeed.The film originated when two brothers and their best friend--David and Jerry Zucker and Jim Abrahams--created a live show called Kentucky Fried Theatre, and it proved such a hit that the three took the show to Los Angeles, where they managed to interest director John Landis and producer Robert Weiss in turning the whole thing into a low-budget film. Filmed with a no-name cast interspersed with cameos by Bill Bixby, Donald Sutherland, and Henry Gibson, KFM became the surprise hit of 1977.Some of it holds up extremely well, most notably the movie trailers for such imaginary no-class exploitation films as CATHOLIC HIGHSCHOOL GIRLS IN TROUBLE and CLEOPATRA SCHWARTZ, both of which will probably have film buffs screaming with laughter. And then there is a sketch which has a couple making love according to directions issued by a phonograph record, an instructional film on the uses of zinc oxide, a wicked take-off on Point/Counterpoint, and a still darker take-off on television public service announcements--all of them a hoot and half.But when the film falters, it falls with a thud. Fans of Bruce Lee will probably appreciate the film's centerpiece more than I did, a twenty-minute take-off on martial arts films called A Fistful of Yen; I myself thought it would be more amusing if it were half as long. The Feel-Around selection was a clever idea that never actually took off, and really much the same can be said for most of the sketches.Some of it is a matter of datedness what was topical in 1977 doesn't necessarily have a great deal of relevance for a contemporary viewer. Some of it is shock-humor that doesn't shock any more because it has been done so often and so much better. But even so, and while the film as a whole is perhaps best approached as a cultural artifact, it's still worth a look--particularly if you like such films as AIRPLANE, THE NAKED GUN, ANIMAL HOUSE, and THE BLUES BROTHERS, all of which were created by various members of the crew that originally created KENTUCKY FRIED MOVIE. On the whole, I do recommend the film as a curiosity--and it would be a great party film--but this isn't one that you're likely to replay a great deal.Gary F.

There are moments that are truly funny, for sure. But there is also an excess of one-dimensional jokes, puns, and shallow visual humor that must assume that the audience is either in 4th grade or has chemically altered its perception to approximate such a level of consciousness. It fails to live up to the high standard that the Zukers established in subsequent hits like Airplane and The Naked Gun, instead more closely resembling their efforts on botched films like Amazon Women on the Moon and Airplane 2. The Zuckers, in my opinion, are very much hit or miss.As with their later and more famous efforts, part of the fun of this film is seeing some relatively major stars doing cameos, sometimes as themselves &#150; in this case people like Donald Sutherland and failed Bond George Lazenby. The action moves fast enough that presumably the audience is never bored, unless like me they start to miss any semblance of a unifying concept, character, or story. But then as soon as you're thinking there's nothing there, suddenly the film seems to focus briefly on a martial arts story that's not nearly funny enough to justify its ample portion of the film's running time (although it does end on a nice note with its homage to Wizard of Oz). John Landis indulges his friend Rick Baker's ape obsession, which is fun in an inside joke kind of way even if his gorilla is no more amusing than the ones who used to chase Bela Lugosi around in Bowery Boys films.All in all, it was a sign of good things to come and it gave me a few laughs, but not much more.

While the content may occasionally be unfunny or drag on incessantly, it more than makes up for it during its funny moments as well as its boundless energy. In a way, it looks like a home movie made by a bunch of immature friends. And, this makes the movie strangely endearing. As far as the funny stuff goes, there is a lot--though my favorite (and probably sickest) skit is the public service announcement about the dead. The unfunniest portion is the over-long Bruce Lee-type film. While it is funny in spots, it detracts from the film and slows the pace to a crawl. In other words, the skits come rapid-fire--one after another with no let up--until the Asian Kung Fu movie that seems to last 10 times longer than any other skit. It's a shame they didn't just make two different films instead of trying to combine them.So overall, its a fairly funny and fairly stupid movie that definitely is NOT kid-friendly!
