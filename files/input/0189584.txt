[{"Title":"A refreshingly intelligent film","Date":"18 October 2000","Score":"46 out of 54 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama, Comedy","Review":"  This refreshingly intelligent film delivers raw intellectual power by retaining the look and feel of the play from which it was adapted.  The use of a single set and just three actors throws the emphasis entirely upon the in-depth character studies, the incisive dialogue and the actors' outstanding performances.  It draws us into the lives of three seemingly ordinary guys at a convention whose interaction broaches questions that are nothing short of an examination of the meaning of life.  The dialogue unabashedly strips the characters naked to show the ironies and hypocrisies inherent in their strategies for establishing meaning in the machinations of mundane lives.  The laser sharp exchanges slash relentlessly at the souls of each, leaving none of the characters intact by the end of the film.  And with each thrust, they drive another introspective probe deep into the psyche of the viewer.The presentation reminded me a little of `Glengarry Glen Ross' with its theatrical feel and deep reflective tone, although this film was more confronting and less darkly despondent.  Roger Roeff's penetrating script approaches the meaninglessness of life from three unique perspectives.  We have Larry (Kevin Spacey) the seemingly superficial cynic who has far greater depth than he lets on and who uses his sardonic persona as a defense mechanism to hide his own fears.  Phil (Danny DeVito) is the pragmatic but jaded salesman who is great at putting things in perspective for everyone but himself.  Bob is the na√Øve young Christian zealot whose antidote for the futility of life is a strong dose of Jesus.The juxtaposition of Larry the cynic and Bob the idealist makes for numerous thought provoking exchanges, especially when we learn that Phil (our mediator and voice of reason) is drowning in his own soul-searching quest for meaning.  The story poses more questions than it does answers, and sputters a bit at the end, but overall it accomplishes its purpose of making the viewer ponder profundities easily ignored while in the pursuit of everyday priorities.The acting was brilliant.  Kevin Spacey gave what I thought was the best performance of his career.  This was so much more interesting and meaty a character than he played in `American Beauty' that Spacey easily eclipsed even that outstanding performance.  Larry was such a dynamic and complex character, that Spacey was able to open up the throttle and show us the full measure of his considerable talents.  Likewise, Danny DeVito delivered a personal best in a serious dramatic role.  His portrayal of the mediator who was trying to keep the peace while he was disintegrating inside was subtle and powerful.  Peter Facinelli was also near perfect with an utterly believable and sincere performance as the pure hearted whelp whose heart was suffused with the Lord.I rated this film a 9/10, but it requires a certain type of viewer to enjoy it.  It is a very intellectual film, which precludes it from having much mass appeal.  Action junkies will be bored to tears.  However, for those who have a philosophical bent, this film will be highly satisfying.

The expression saving the best for last applies strongly to this film. We were fortunate to have a Q&A after the film with Roger Rueff, the screenwriter of this eloquently written piece, John Swanbeck, the director enjoying all that a first timer could hope for from his debut, and the gifted actor Kevin Spacey, who starred in and produced the film.	This marvellous examination of three men of different age groups at a convention in Wichita also features the talents of Danny DeVito who apparently came to the production in the proverbial last minute. This film was shot in a very short sixteen days which comes as a surprise, despite it's one central location, as the dialogue is so strong. The best way to describe it is as almost poetic. The script was adapted from the play Hospitality Suite, also written by Rueff, who revealed in the Q&A that the story was based upon his own experiences at a sales convention long ago. But he assured us that his character of the young, impressionable, bible thumping Bob was not based on himself. Rueff also noted that with this being his first screenplay, he had worried about the horror stories he heard where scripts are butchered and transformed into things the writer never intended in many Hollywood productions. But in this case, he trusted the director and cast implicitly and was not disappointed in any way.	Kevin Spacey shines in this sneak peak behind the scenes of a sales convention where the future of a company lies squarely on the shoulders of three men in the pursuit of a big client. The president of another company represents the biggest potential account they will ever have. They exchange stories, accounts and personal philosophies and find how different they are from one another based on what they've been through.	The interaction between the three actors is mesmerizing. They take the audience into what feels like a true life account documented verbatim. To say more would spoil the outcome for those who've not yet had a chance to enjoy this film. It is my strong recommendation that all of those who have not, do so at their first available opportunity.

'The Big Kahuna' is like that. Most of the scenes are set in one hotel room and only 4 people have any lines. It could be said that all they do is talk, philosophize, and soul-search in this film. So if what they talk about is interesting and moves you, then the movie works. With subject matter such as religion, friendship, finding a meaning in life, and even the art of salesmanship, the characters definitely have a lot to say. And they're pretty funny, even if the film is too tragic to be called a comedy. Bottom line is, I'll long remember Danny DeVito's touching, understated performance.He and Kevin Spacey (Phil and Larry, respectively) play experienced industrial lubricant salesman who've been sent to a convention in Wichita. Accompanying the two longtime friends and colleagues is a young co-worker, Bob (Peter Facinelli). They're hosting a small party in their hospitality suite for the elusive Dick Fuller. This is a client who could conceivably make or break their careers, but might not even show up to talk biz. Fuller represents the title character, although you could also say the kahuna is God. The final third of the picture delves deeply into spiritual belief and the search for the man above. Facinelli is devout, Spacey is not, DeVito rides in the middle lane and tries to keep the peace.Whether or not they actually make the big deal plays second fiddle to the give-and-take relationship of the 3 very different men. Spacey is as witty and smart as usual, but DeVito is the soul of 'The Big Kahuna'. He's been good before, but he's generally a comic actor. Here, he's the straight man. The writer and director (Roger Rueff and John Swanbeck, who've never made another film) know how to give Spacey his big scenes and they REALLY know how to let DeVito play everything in expressions and tone. The filmmakers aren't breaking new turf, but they let their excellent actors act. Even if this is just another verse in the 'Death Of A Salesman' song, DeVito's got the goods on Willy Loman.

In fact, the stage origins of the film are evident in the fact that the action rarely extends beyond a single set &#150; a hotel suite in Wichita, Kansas in which three salesman are gathered for a convention &#150; and the fact that only four people are even assigned speaking parts (and even the fourth is a mere walk-on bellboy).  All the other people we see serve as a kind of silent backdrop before which the three principal players enact their complex personal drama.Kevin Spacey, in a truly brilliant performance, plays Larry, a middle-aged, sardonic salesman who sees life strictly from the perspective of a hardcore cynic and who, consequently, runs roughshod over his two business associates with his acerbic wit and hardnosed bluntness.  In total contrast is Bob (Peter Facinelli), a 20-something neophyte to the selling business, a sincere, well-intentioned, but hopelessly na√Øve born-again Christian, who has trouble separating his career as a salesman from his felt need to fulfill the Biblical edict to go out among men and spread the Good News.  Caught between the two is Phil (Danny DeVito), a 52-year old man who, after years of devoting his life to the cause of selling, has begun to seriously question the validity of his life's work and has, therefore, recently found himself contemplating such weighty matters as suicide, the existence of God and the meaning of love and friendship.  Obviously, such cleanly delineated characters could well have slid over into two-dimensional stereotypes, yet the author, Roger Rueff, in adapting his play to the screen, has built into each of the three principal figures a dimension of multifaceted human complexity.  Larry, for instance, despite all of his facile cynicism, shows a far deeper side to his character when, in a quiet moment in which Phil pours his heart out to him, he offers his buddy the hand of genuine compassion and friendship.  We discover that the often-bitter tone Larry displays to the world is just a fa√ßade, a cover-up for the void that lies deep within his own troubled psyche.  Similarly, Rueff avoids the common trap of reducing the devout Christian character to the customary level of a mindless buffoon.  Although we sense that Bob too uses his Christianity as a way of ordering his life - thereby avoiding the messy ugliness that a more freethinking life often requires - yet, Rueff merely implies that Bob has some growing up to do, not that his belief system must itself be jettisoned.  And Phil, caught between these two worldviews, provides, out of his own confused weakness, the voice of reasoned sanity that helps Larry and Bob come to a final understanding and mutual appreciation of each other.  He sees Larry plainly for who he is, yet Phil knows that this is the person who means more to him than anyone else in the world.  Similarly, though he somewhat admires and respects Bob's sincere devotion to his Christian principles, Phil knows that Bob has a long way to go before he becomes a true `man of character.'`The Big Kahuna' does not provide big laughs, though the sardonic wit often strikes a deep chord in the audience.  The film may also seem claustrophobic to those who demand more movement from their movies.  The dialogue, however, is consistently sharp and incisive, even though Phil's final speech borders a bit on the pedantic.  (At this point, Phil's function as the author's mouthpiece becomes a bit heavy-handed to say the least).  Nevertheless, for those in search of a fine character study, driven by strong performances and insightful observations about human nature, `The Big Kahuna' is definitely worth checking out.

The Big Kahuna - on whom the fortunes of their company rests. Should they land the contract with this mysterious bigwig, their company will prosper. If they don't land the contract, of course, then they're all sunk.Larry (Kevin Spacey) and Phil (Danny DeVito) are the salesmen, and Bob (Peter Facinelli) is the marketing guy. Bob's a rookie, and Larry and Phil try to prep him for handling himself with potential customers. They've rented the hospitality suite in the hotel to entertain their clients and are planning on having a small party, hoping that the Big Kahuna will show up. No, it's not Waiting for Godot, but it's along those lines.This is basically a character study. There's a lot of dialog - virtually the entire movie takes place in the suite, with only a few very minor scenes outside it - and each word is absolutely dripping with meaning. There aren't any throwaway lines in this movie, folks. Most movies contain generic lines that would fit in any similar movie. Not this one. If you're a fan of well-written movies, this is a prime example of how one should be constructed.But with such an emphasis on the dialog, there's naturally little action. This is always a problem with movies based on plays. They come off restrained, stagey, and claustrophobic. But the lack of action actually gives the viewer the opportunity to watch two decidedly different acting styles. Spacey is bombastic, punctuating each syllable with a sneer or a rant. DeVito, on the other hand, is more reserved and appears wizened as a result. Each actor turns in a stunning performance, with Spacey basically reprising the role he played in Glengarry Glen Ross. The only one who seems out of place is Facinelli, who is ineffective as Bob the marketing guy.The Big Kahuna is compelling, as long as you don't mind talky comedy-dramas.

The setup - three business men, all in a different life stage, is elegant and sparse, and allows the three characters to develop fully. By the end of the movie, we are fed a desperate moral theory that regret builds character along with (I kid you not) several minutes of voice-over aphorisms. What happened? Instead of sending the movie into where it should have gone, namely ambiguity as to a) what matters to the characters, b) what is at stake, c) what wisdom can possibly be recovered from the mess that the characters get themselves into, we are instead led to a basement of philosophical knickknacks. Failing a reasonable ending, it would at least have been nice to see the characters grow... or perhaps engage in some entertaining pyrotechnics. On the plus side we get to hear grown men say they love each other, so not all is lost...the dream recounting is also well planned & executed.

If it doesn't define the true character, it surely reflects on the core of how they see their art. This is Spacey's creation, and it speaks highly of what he is about.Spacey and DeVito are not multidimensional actors. That is, they don't present simultaneous views (like say Hoffman and Penn). No, they aren't modern in this sense, instead find a single center and use it to manipulate a thread, instead shifting that thread up into introspection, down into `action,' up again into that space where art meets life. For such actors, the writing is central - everything centers on conversation and focus.So here, we have a film about conversation; about whether conversations have their own fate; whether directed conversations can be honest, which is the same as exploring the nature of whether acting can be honest. The dialog is in one world at a time, but shifts among acting as being human, acting as being `marketeers,' acting as being actors.This shift is managed by toggling the focus the Big Kahuna flips among a key sales target (Fuller, Dick), God, a disembodied Godot called Murdock, and all of three actors.DeVito is one of the most intelligent film people in Hollywood, going so far as making a comedy from Nabokov (`Momma'). Spacey has focus, and cares to fabricate something that manipulates and tells us so and why.`If you know what you are doing, you don't have to look like you know what you are doing.'Put this on the shelf with Andre and Vanya.

But for all the quality, it's a bit hard to see the focal point of the drama is supposed to be about. Spacey plays a pushy, egotistical salesman whose frustration with the self-righteous Facinelli suddenly boils over; the extension from the everyday to the existential is well-handled but never opens the heart of the character to us, de Vito vouches for him but it's not quite enough.

And you don't really know this until you have watched the movie a couple of times. Yet he sets the stage for this discussion from a very shallow perspective and it is not until the final minutes of the movie when the writer closes the deal and delivers on that promise in a way that is so far from shallow that you cannot forget it. The scene (and many others) are unforgettable. Finally, do not miss the astonishing, brief and powerfully subtle dream sequences.

Alright, Kevin Spacey, Danny de Vito, what could go wrong? During the first 15 minutes of the movie, it felt it could turn out good, although the constant blabbering of Spacey's character started to annoy. Three guys two marketing veterans, De Vito and Spacey, and a new guy, in a hotel room planning a reception to get some big cheese business guy to use their lubricants. After 30 minutes, nothing has changed. There's only conversation. We start to think this movie was made in one day, and in one take. Every half ass bit of dialogue stayed in somehow. And all of a sudden, after 45 minutes... NOTHING, still nothing! Dear god! I guess  the screenwriter, who also wrote the original play, must have thought that if he'd just let the characters talk on and on and say quas√© intelligent and insightful things, he would have a brilliant movie.  Then there's the reception which the whole movie is about. Big cheese dude doesn't show up, Spacey's character goes halfway nuts (but not in a funny or cool way, just annoying), De Vito doesn't care (he doesn't care about anything, which IS interesting) and the new guy doesn't know whether he cares.  New guy spoke to big businessman, didn't know it was him, got a card and went to big businessman's party, it all leads to nothing.Nearing the end there are some decent conversation between De Vito and the new guy and that's about it. Now, a movie were nothing happens can be very interesting, when there is great dialogue, likeable characters, great actors, and some kind of coming of age-ending, but this movie offers none of those features. 98 percent of the movie takes place in the terribly boring hotel room, which makes you want to sleep, the overall pace of the film does so even more.

The setting is all pretty much laid out to establish the genre and imagery of this film... The frumpy and unassuming western end of the Midwest (Wichita)...An emphatically uneventful aspect of the adjective upscale, by way of an anonymous Raddissson hotel...Cheese and crackers, instead of gulf shrimp!! Last but not least, the indication that a lot of sales excursions for these three men have resulted in less than aupicatory satisfaction!!! Ultimately, what clinches the motif of monumental failure in these three men's lives is that they are painfully reminded of how disappointing the whole sales rigmarole can be!! It is alright to fail, however, failure must have a reason, and now, for Kevin Spacey and Danny DeVito, recrimination must serve a constructive purpose!! Being lambasted by mediocrity has become the insidious social hindrance which has aggregately demoralized both of them!! For these two, their Horatio Alger spirits have been utterly vitiated!!! This is a very ideologically riveting concept that the film The Big Kahuna purveys!!The intense emotions in this movie are extremely realistic!! Kevin Spacey's performance is remarkable!!! The ideological premise of life having a cohesive plausibility has been totally obliterated in this film!!! For better or for worse, reality has now become vicariously abusive!!! The resonating attitudes for the main characters in this movie ultimately emerged with all three men have a clearer understanding of one another. I found this movie to be identifiable and poignant!! Upper middle class hang-ups have effortlessly thwarted as well as devoured all three of these men!!! Failure to close a sale transcends the loss of commission, it also serves as an indictment on an individual's charisma!! The outstanding portrayal of recognizable human inadequacies is the key component as to why I strongly recommend that every salesperson in this country sees this film!!

(Dir John Swanback)Kevin Spacey, arguably one of our finest actors performing today and with a recent Oscar win as Best Actor in the Best Picture of the Year, `American Beauty', has talent to burn and in his current display of subtle, nuanced brio he takes a step down in this indie satire that he produced, as a pet project.Spacey stars as Larry Mann, a fast-talking, smug and perhaps too sharp for his own good marketing salesman for a midWestern industrial lubricant manufacturer who is one of three fellow travelers setting up a much anticipated greet/meet with an important client (the eponymous moniker he uses as a mantra to signify the underlining of its significance) in the unlikely hotel suite in Wichita, Kansas.Also on board are his best friend and longtime associate Phil Cooper (De Vito in a wonderfully low-keyed, yet bluntly hewned turn) and green recruit Bob Walker (Facinelli, who I am hard pressed to keep from comparing him to a Tom Cruise manque, and proved wrong I might add by his performance that requires full concentration and total believeablilty for his task at hand), who contradict the self-assured Larry, who has convened the trio on their cramped luxury accomodations, by being there for one sole purpose land the grand account.What makes the story intriguing is the cutting dialogue lobbed with perfection by its players that manage to raise it above a watered down David Mamet parable about men bonding (and unbonding as the case remains) and the cunning skill it takes to be a businessman and shirking one's individuality for the almighty buck.  That's when the film on itself nearly capsizes.Basically the storyline unfolds like `Waiting For Godot', the three salesman have set up a cocktail party for their meeting with this red herring of sorts, and what ultimately comes down the pike is he shows but unknowingly to Larry and Phil, has had a heart to heart with the young Bob.  Realizing they only have one shot when Bob casually describes a warm conversation leading to an invitation to an exclusive gathering late in the evening, Larry and Phil persuade their cohort to ingratiate himself into the good graces of their client-to-be which results in an unlikely turn of events namely the subject of one's self-beliefs (i.e. what one considers important and in this case it is Bob's straight-arrow image and his strong will in being a faithful, God-fearing man who loves his wife and believes there's more to life than this account).Spacey and De Vito, reunited from `L.A. Confidential' make a nice comic team as they try to make sense of their lives, particularly the latter's downward spiral since his pending divorce and sudden sense of getting out of the business, leaving the former flummoxed and later, to a fault, self-discovery that it may have been too late.There are some comparisons to a Billy Wilder sense of responsiblities here and the stagy direction by theatrical trained Swanback (the piece was performed onstage as well) but that only enhances the nicely conveyed characters on screen.  Spacey has a lot of fun here particularly in having his character display some spontaneous feats of frustration to comic effect in one scene he practically has a hissy fit on a sofa and in another his apoplectic facial reactions are only harnessed by his sarcastic responses. Funny and enlightening a rare combination.  The same could be said of Kevin Spacey himself.

The story has three salesmen -- or marketers as they like to call themselves -- holed up in a hotel room waiting and hoping for the Big Kahuna, the jackpot client, to show up at their party.Among the strengths, the sterling cast -- Kevin Spacey as the wisecracking but perceptive pusher; Danny DeVito as the recently divorced, troubled friend; and Peter Facinelli as the morally pure Baptist acolyte. That's about the whole cast, and there's basically one setting -- that arid hotel room -- because this play hasn't really been opened up much.The actors -- I don't know how to put this -- but they LOOK right for their parts. Kevin Spacey as they guy who debases most others, and Facinelli as the plain-faced innocent are especially good. Danny DeVito may be the weakest of the trio, if only because he never really LOOKS depressed. Can you imagine a suicidally melancholic Danny DeVito? Another strength is in the lines written for Spacey's character. His dialog varies from resignation to something that turns logic into an Escher drawing or a Mobius strip, in which everything seems to lead back to where it began. Some are hilarious.Alas, a play or movie has to be ABOUT something. The diverse salesmen as a way of exploring character is so old that it MUST be trustworthy, from the Maysles brothers' Salesman, to Tin Men and Glen Gary Glen Ross. Yet, we don't know what these guys are supposed to be selling, some kind of lubricant, but that's all.And there's a religious element of the kind that's best left masked by events. Not only does Facinelli continually reveal his spiritual purity but Danny DeVito, unprovoked, spins a long and improbable story of a dream he had about rescuing God who was hiding in a closet after some calamity. I said it was improbable only because my own dreams are entirely lacking in the kind of clarity, unity, and organization that DeVito's dream had. Also, while I'm at it, is it okay if I register a minor complaint to whoever is in charge of the lighting that I'm getting pretty fed up with the overuse of burnt orange? And they're too dark too. And can I please have more women and fewer ogres? When the characters discuss God and religion and all that, it sounds like a couple of college sophomores earnestly schmoozing over some weed. It all seems like an attempt to elevate the story to a plane on which it simply doesn't belong.The strengths outpace the weaknesses by a head.

An ensemble of three manages to keep your attention for 90 minutes, enduring an existence seemingly entirely focused around industrial lubricants. You would think that was impossible, till you see DeVito dance character-circles around a heavy weight like Kevin Spacy, and see relative new-comer Peter Facinelli go toe-to-toe with both of them, like it was the easiest thing in the world. This is a showcase of acting ability, more than anything else. This is skill versus the emptiness of the premise. Danny DeVito, Kevin Spacey and Peter Facinelli puts in mind- and trouser-blowingly good performances, that will make any actor think twice before they take on this script (it being based on Hospitality Suite, by Roger Rueff).And speaking of which, you will not often see Kevin Spacey be out- acted by anyone, but DeVito puts in a performance that would shake gods to their foundations (fittingly, as you may come to understand). The emotions and timing at display here, are far, far beyond what you might expect from a small movie - but Spaceys production undoubtedly allowed for just that (including his own). As a story-teller, I often view a scene or two from this, at random, just to soak in a bit of the glorious performances, and brilliant matter-of-factness there seems to be to this entire, spectacular celebration of an art form.

Larry is blunt, and fouled mouth, but deep down good hearted. Phil is very relaxed, but we feel he hasn't always been this way in the past. Bob, played by Peter Facinelli, is a newcomer, still has a lot to learn to get those industrial lubricants soled. Bob is very religious, in fact, he finds spreading the good news of Jesus is more important than selling lubricants. The three guys are trying to get the big sale, or the Big Kahuna, as Larry would call him. So they get together in their hospitality suite, and invite plenty of guests who are not as important as the Big Kahuna, but the Big Kahuna is invited. Come 930 Larry is upset that he hasn't arrived and decides to search for him. When the night is over the three of the discuss the night and relish in disappointment that the big sale wasn't made. When Bob realizes that the whole night he was talking to the Big Kahuna and had no idea, Larry and Phil send him on a mission to reconnect to make the sale. While Bob is gone, the film really starts to shine with the dialogue between Larry and Phil. Larry and Phil discuss their friendship, God, Life, and so-forth. This scene is where the depth of this movie grows greatly, and we realize, we may never see anywhere out of the hospitality suite. After several hours Bob arrives, telling Larry and Phil that they had a great talk, but only about Jesus. Larry is understandably upset, and leaves. Phil is calm, but proceeds to tell Bob that he has no character, because he doesn't realize that he has made a mistake to regret. The whole movie, we wait for some sort of solution. Did Bob finally make the big sale with the Big Kahuna? Does the Big Kahuna find his way to Christ? For the films sake, either would excited and relieving, both would be a miracle. But we never really know, what the Big Kahuna got out of Bob. Dialogue is the key to this movie, and by far it's greatest strength. The setting is simple, and Spacey, DeVito, and Facinelli are merely the instruments used to accomplish this films goals in dialogue. And they do it the best. The questions could be asked, is Bob right in sharing what he believed is right in Christ? Is Larry right to be mad? But it doesn't matter who is right. They all believe in one thing, marketing. Phil makes this point to Bob, Bob is a salesman for Christ, and Larry industrial lubricants. But Bob chooses to respectfully disagree. Maybe he's right too? Who knows.

Normally I'm never a too big fan of this but there are some successful movies who use this approach as well, as for instance the earlier mentioned Glengarry Glen Ross but also the John Huston classic Key Largo and the Dutch movie example Cloaca.Nevertheless it's a movie that becomes good to watching thanks to its acting. Danny DeVito is really good but truly great is Kevin Spacey, though his character in the movie is still the least well developed one. We never fully get to understand his character and he seems to have many different faces, which also doesn't particularly makes his character a likable one.It's a movie that I enjoyed watching, mostly thanks to its acting but it's not one I really liked very much though.

Within the stagy script there is a commentary on the American dream, the nature of the sales business and the relationships between the men but it isn't as sharp nor as intelligent as it thinks it is. At times the narrative appears to wander off on the specifics of the discussion and loses touch with the wider meaning.

Spacey rules the film in regards volume and he is on good form. DeVito is much more restrained and delivers well. The two work off one another really well and fit their characters well. Facinelli is not as good although I'm not sure if that is because his character is not as good &#150; more a device than the other two characters.Overall then an interesting film that is worth seeing for the strong performances from the lead two.

Simply, the man wears a suit as well as, say, Pierce Brosnan in the $7,000-per tailored threads he wore as James Bond. In Other People's Money and Ruthless People, he played a well-to-do man, either married or involved with women significantly taller than he - but never, for even a moment, did you notice his height, and he was as believable, realistic and engaging in his characterizations, as would have been Michael Douglas, Kevin Kostner, Kevin Kline or even Pitt or Clooney.There is something about DeVito's presence and ability to make his physical limitations unnoticeable (unless this is the point, such as Twins). Along with Spacey, as fine (and versatile) an actor as there perhaps ever has been seen, the two are a throughly interesting duo.This filmed stage play, (set in Wichita yet), features two salesman, Danny's Phil and Kervin's Larry, tired, disillusioned, not very happy - examining their lives. Ensconced in a typical 2- or 3-star hotel suite, we have an opportunity to view the two of them at their best. The story, with young Peter Facinelli as Bob, their young apprentice, provides the kind of dialog as found in work by Pinter, Williams,etc., and films like the harsher Glengary Glen Ross and the gentler My Dinner with Andre. Bob is a naive, simple, born-again Christian, in counterpoint to the thoroughly cynical and brash Larry, and the more thoughtful, but equally droll, Phil.They are scrabbling at the convention to effectuate a make-or-break type of deal (industrical lubricants are their wares), but this is secondary to the interaction among the three, and the interesting view of the many dimensions to the relationship between long-time colleague played by Danny and Kevin.Interesting to note, that although scenes are mostly within the hotel suite, filming actually was done in Wichita, as portrayed.This is a good 9* representation of this genre, and if your type of entertainment, well worth the viewing.

Kudos to writer Roger Rueff for an intelligent script and screenplay. Spacey's character is witty, confident and full of opinions. DeVito's character draws upon his lack of self worth and his doubts invite sympathy. The character played by Facinelli seems clueless to the ways of life...life being actually making that big sale.

The salesman must suffer a high pressure and usually he must assume a very pro-active role,  but its work will be measured only by the results. It's depending on final decision of the customer (the Big Kahuna in the movie). Loneliness, they must travel so much, the cold of hotel rooms and at the end the impersonal  task to perform. The salesman is considered as a simple tool, the robots will can substitute in the future. They must accept that in fact, they are -and will be- nobody. Bob (Facinelly) is an idealist with very strict  moral values. He's recently married and he is  starting with the job.Larry (Spacey) is a vigorous salesman, with a big background in the job and he is trying to  teach Bob about the job and about the real life. He is the most afraid about the commercial  results.And Phil (DeVito) is tired of this kins of work and he only looks for keep a peaceful ambient  in the team. He is disgusting about hard comments of Larry to Bob.The movie is purely constructed with the dialogs.A couple of lessons supposedly can be extracted of the film about how a young man must  affront the usual problems ( professional and personal ones) in the life. The importance to acknowledge the errors committed in order to improve the character and  just listening to other people's points of view, the difference between a real dialog and just  propaganda.A good work of Spacey and DeVito, linking in the end credits with the famous (during 1999)  wear sunscreen speech/song.

Its stage roots are obvious and the film wisely avoids trying to add too much to an essentially one-set script. I was pleasantly surprised by the casting, expecting De Vito to play the frenetic salesman and Spacey to be the quiet brooder rather than the reverse. De Vito's performance completely overshadows Spacey's who is merely competent in his role. The negatives to the film were that some of the sharper dialogue was omitted and a terribly out of place final coda tacked on, ostensibly in an attempt not to offend more sensitive viewers. Still, if you're in mood for a talky but entertaining film, Big Kahuna is worth a rental. Better yet, if you get the chance, see the play.

Facinelli as Bob","Date":"7 December 2001","Score":"","Genre":"Drama, Comedy","Review":"  SPOILERS - It's all about character. I put The Big Kahuna among the better films I've seen this year. It must have been made with a small budget, virtually all filming is done inside a hotel suite in Wichita, there are no special effects, and very little background music. It was adapted from a play and has the look and feel of a stage production. It is dialog-driven, and is all about character development.Old veteran salesmen, and best freinds, Larry (Kevin Spacey) and Phil (Danny DeVito) are hosting a hospitality suite for their company, Lodestar Laboratories, and their mission is to made a big industrial lubricants sale to a Mr Fuller. They are joined by pretty boy Bob (Peter Facinelli), a fresh college graduate and newlywed, and member of the research department. Bob is a quiet, very religious young man, Larry is a blunt, filthy-mouth, over-the-top loudmouth cynic, and Phil is mellow, always seeming to find the middle ground when Larry and Bob get into their philosophical discussions. Larry gets great pleasure on pushing Bob's buttons.During the social, somehow Phil and Larry miss Mr Fuller, assume he just didn't show up. After guests left, and Bob was telling them about his conversation with one guest about his dogs, about life, about Jesus, it comes to light that he had been talking to Mr Fuller. Larry goes bananas, tries to figure out how to approach him.  Bob had his card, and what amounted to an invitation to a following private party. Bob is sent, carefully coached on how to let Mr Fuller know they would like a few minutes of his time the next morning to talk about lubricants.Bob goes, finds Mr Fuller, and after a long visit returns to Larry and Phil. What did they talk about?  Life and God. Why? Because that's what Bob wanted to talk about.  Larry went ballistic. The company paid to send them there for a job, sell lubricants.  Bob and Larry argue, actually tussle, Phil has to intercede. As in all their disagrements, Phil tries to find the middle ground. The film starts with Bob wondering how he will develop character.  Phil explains that you can only develop character after you've realized there are things you regret. He explained that Bob has done things he should regret, just doesn't understand that yet, so has not developed character yet.Film ends the next morning, Larry sees Bob in the lobby, talking with Mr Fuller. Bob and Larry exchange barely perceptable glances, we know that Bob understands that his talking to Mr Fuller about lubricants need not compromise his principles.  Bob is developing character.All three actors are just right in their roles here. Spacey will get most attention, but I believe DeVito was the best actor here.The DVD is in Dobly 5.1, however there is very little use for such a sound track with this type of dialog-driven film. Could just as easily have been in Hi-Fi mono sound.  No meaningful extras. But a very fine film for anyone who enjoys a masterful character study.  I rate it 8 of 10.

Their main objective is to find The Big Kahuna to endorse their industrial lubricant products, which will be by far their #1 sale.I'll be frank, this movie has absolutely no action or any suspense at all. The movie is well cinematography at it's best, basing it's whole idea in this one room where the three of them are in close quarters.The characters are introduced to us through conversation.  Kevin Spacey's character is a salesmen that seems to have much knowledge about business with his friend of many years Danny DeVito.  Peter Facinelli's character is the new kid on the block.  They're trying to break him in.  Along the way they all find out that Peter Facinelli's character, Bob, is a very religious human being, which causes many problems.  Kevin Spacey's character, Larry, spots this immediately and tries to break his holy ways from interfering with why they're here.  Danny DeVito's character, Phil, is a man of much life experiences and is going through a mid-life crisis.To sum it all up, in the end Bob lets his beliefs and values overcome his reason for being at this convention.  Turns out all he can talk about with all the people he meets at this convention, including Dick Fuller, The Big Kahuna himself, is talking about God and Jesus!  This movie is by far a movie that I will remember for many years in the future.  It's a well directed and composed script with many life lessons to learned.  By far it has to be, in my opinion, the best movie of 99'.  In the end, one man is selling God while the other is selling his business, who will win?

This is a welcome respite from the typical cinematic chum (Don't you die on me! I'm too old for this sh*t). Nevertheless, when you do that, you have to pursue the arguments made in the film to their logical conclusion. While it's difficult to discuss the final flaw in too much detail without giving away the ending, it suffices to say that there is a comparison of the Christian method of proselytizing (witnessing in the common parlance) to the salesmanship of the other characters. The problem with this is that the salesman don't seem to really give a damn about their product and how it affects the customer in contrast to the witness. This makes all of the difference.And this is not a fatal problem, if this wouldn't necessarily occur to the character in the film, but the born again new guy stands toe to toe (rhetorically) with Kevin Spacey's war hardened sales veteran throughout the entire movie. When arguments fail to be made at the end, even the actor seems to be frustrated, as if truncated by the director.While imperfect, Kevin Spacey's usual brilliance and Farinelli's standout performance, a polar opposite from his Can't Hardly Wait role, make this a definite step up from celluloid tripe also hitting the shelves the same week like Final Destination.

Their objective is to find the most lucrative client who, in the business, is referred to as the Grand Kahuna or Big Kahuna  Screenplay is built around three main characters Larry (Danny Devito), Phil (Kevin Spacey) and Bob (Peter Facinelli). Phil and Larry have been in this business for a long time and very experienced businessmen whereas Bob is just a rookie. It is only these three characters that ever appear in the big screen throughout the entire movie and the whole thing takes place in one hotel room. The only thing that keeps the movie going is the conversations these people are having with each other especially the speeches -or should I say lectures- of Phil who is the leading man. Kevin Spacey, as always, is a magnificent figure, a towering presence in the screen. Danny Devito is playing the role of a rather quite and a tired man who is at the brink of a divorce. The only fun you might have out of this movie is the conversations for there is no storyline in the usual meaning of this term. That's why I believe this movie would make a good play; the screenplay seems to have been written directly for the play. The movie starts with their getting prepared for the little convention they are organizing in the hope that one of the biggest clients whom Larry invited will show up. To their dismay, the man they had been waiting for doesn't show up. However, they realise that another big client has attended their little convention and had a conversation with Bob. It turns out that he has invited Bob to another meeting that will take place in another hotel. So, Phil and Larry decide to send Bob to that meeting to give the client their business cards along with the message that they would like to talk business with him. However, things get a little out of hand, especially for Phil, when Bob starts selling industrial lubricants and starts selling Jesus. If you like a movie starring 2 great actors with a lot of conversation about sales business, life and death, Jesus and God, you might enjoy this movie. But keep in mind that there are only 3 characters in the movie and the only location you will ever see is the hotel room due to the limited storyline.

If not, then you have probably never seen a stage production in your life. It is a one-set, three character play in two acts. The story is not a huge one. If the characters go through any big changes, we don't really see them, but, what we do see is a series of conversations. In them we that we learn what these three guys are doing there, and how they feel about things such as work, marriage, dealing with people, human character, truth, and God. Boring, you say? I have to disagree.It is often possible to sum up the plot of a movie in a single sentence. While it may be truthful, it may not do the story justice. `Marketing reps wait in a hospitality suite during a convention in Wichita seeking to do business with their biggest potential client ever.'  Sounds exciting, huh? What could possibly make you want to see this? Mostly the fact that Kevin Spacey and Danny DeVito are in it. What could possibly make them want to do this? Nothing more than the opportunity to perform the aforementioned conversations. They both have major credentials in taking on the roles of a salesman and businessmen (Other Peoples Money, Tin Men, Swimming With Sharks). We get to see them do what they do best, with minimal directing and camera tricks.As the president of a manufacturing company in the Midwest, they want to be `El Kahuna Grande's' supplier of industrial lubricants. It's the account of a lifetime. This is their only objective. Phil and Larry have been on the road for years. Bob (Peter Facinelli) is six months out of school, six months with the company, and six months married. He's only there to represent research and development and to learn. As they teach him what they can, the movie unfolds. Trouble is, Bob thinks talking about Christ is more important, which it is, but after all, this is a business convention. Nobody says don't talk about Jesus, just remember to get some work done.Scenes with well written dialogue and monologues are hard to find in screenplays these days, I guess. This movie is all talking. It's an acting challenge to hold the audience with not much more than words. The kind of challenge found mostly on stage rather than screen. Some actors can do both. DeVito has the more sympathetic role. Older, recently divorced, and tired of the road, he questions continuing in the business, and wonders about the bigger things. He is wonderful as the patient, encouraging, and understanding guy. Spacey has the blunt, sardonic, fast-talking, self-confident, aggressive type of guy down pat. He also has true moments of sincere concern and honesty. It's too bad that everything he does from now on will be compared to American Beauty. Now they expect to see `Lester Burnham' every time out, and when they don't, then `it shouldn't have been made.' If this movie had unknown actors, and opened at Sundance, it would be hailed as `a wonderful small film.' It's not really a comedy, yet there should be room enough for everything, right? It's something different. Not the action, romance, thriller, sci-fi, or gross-out slapstick playing next door. That is a good thing, if not the main thing.

I've heard many directors say in interviews following the completion of some ambitious film, that their next one will be `two guys talking to each other in a room.' Well, friends, The Big Kahuna is that film. Except in this case, three guys talking to each other in a room. More specifically, the hospitality suite of a Wichita hotel.This is the kind of project that any investor in their right mind would have said no to-until Kevin Spacey and Danny DeVito signed on, that is. The acting is superb, as you'd expect. So is the writing, also as you'd expect, as it's based on a play. Stage plays rely on dialogue and acting. Visuals don't matter nearly as much, so it's always a challenge to transform a play into a film. I can honestly say I wouldn't have seen this play, which must be great, so I'm glad they did make it into a film.Hospitality Suite is, I imagine, one set-the hotel room-and only needs the three characters Larry (Spacey), Phil (DeVito), and Bob (Peter Facinelli). The film takes us outside the hotel room briefly, and inside characters' heads a few times as well. All of this could've been deleted from the story, though. It's almost as if it was added simply to justify the film version. The only story we need, all we need see, is the interaction between characters that takes place inside that room. What drives this story is the collision of different personalities in a confined place Larry is a cynical motormouth; seemingly soulless, a businessman to the core. Phil is also a committed businessman, but more wise and low-key. He's at sort of a spiritual crossroads, suffering through a bitter divorce. Bob is a marketing assistant who is more interested in selling Jesus than he is in selling industrial lubricants. The result of these colliding ideologies is a more exciting, edge-of-your-seat experience than a thriller or action movie. You're sitting there really thinking and caring about the characters, about what will happen next.This works because of the strong dialogue, the caliber of which you will only find in a play adaptation. A film, however, has to be more than just people talking. It's a visual art. Ever since they had to go and add sound to films, there's been an ongoing struggle to make people talk in a way that won't send audiences running, screaming from the theater. In film, what you see, for how long, and when, is paramount. Things like dialogue and acting need to be strong enough not to get in the way of the visual story being told. Believable dialogue and acting is hard to pull off. A filmmaker who decides to stage a play as a film has half the work already done for him (I say `him' only because this particular film was directed by a man). If he really has another way to visually tell the story, other than the dialogue and acting, then by all means, he should go for it. A film like Glengarry Glen Ross (also with Spacey) is a good example of this. The visuals are so powerful, you have trouble even seeing how it was done as a play. The Big Kahuna, I'm sorry to say, never really justifies its existence, other than that it came cheap and had two stars that could deliver an audience. It was all about business.How appropriate.Grade C+ "},{"Title":"Wichita, lubricants, and Jesus.","Date":"26 May 2000","Score":"","Genre":"Drama, Comedy","Review":"      Kevin Spacey returns to the big screen in a small and low key film titled THE BIG KAHUNA.  This film is getting strong buzz and word of mouth since this is the first screen appearance of Spacey since his second Oscar win from AMERICAN BEAUTY.  This is quite a challange since BIG KAHUNA is a film that is considered low budget and it's being released among big summer blockbusters.       BIG KAHUNA is taken from the stage play where three business men gather together for a sales convention in Wichita, Kansas. The three men differ in personality, there's Larry Mann (Kevin Spacey) a enthusiast businessman who's in the peak of his career.  He does deals left and right, he's a smooth talker, who doesn't mind enjoying the scenery of women dressed in business suits.  There's also Phil Cooper (Danny DeVito) a aging professional in sales who realized that most of his life has disappeared before his eyes, and why was he put on this planet.  And then there's Bob Walker (Peter Facinelli) the youngest of the men who is a newly married man, who devotes himself more to Jesus than business.  The three men are in Wichita to try to sign a lubricant deal with the Big Kahuna or the president of the largest company that could help their lubricant company.  The three men talk and discuss many different topics  other business men, women in business suits, sales techniques, dogs, and Jesus.        Since this film is base on a stage play, 90% of the movie takes place in one room.  KAHUNA is a decent little film, it's a change from the big explosion, big special effects films of the summer.  The stand out with this film is obviously the performances.  It doesn't take a genius to figure out why Spacey signed onto this film, since his character has most of the good lines.  But Spacey does another good acting job as the energetic Larry.  And great kudos also go to Danny DeVito who plays the over the hill Phil, a man who is depressed because he realized what he has spent most of his life doing.  And Peter Facinelli is also good as the young and naive Bob, who feels that religion is the most important thing in life.      THE BIG KAHUNA is a decent little film, for under 90 minutes, it's worth the viewing.  But since it is based on a play, there's that steady pacing that the film has.  It doesn't go fast, and it doesn't drag.  It stays on autopilot from start to finish.  So if you're tired and looking for a film to keep you awake, then this isn't the film.  But if you're looking for something different than the multi-million dollar budget films that gross 100 million plus, then this is a nice change of pace. I enjoyed THE BIG KAHUNA, as a story and characters, but for the film or directing, it's nothing special.  ***1/2 (out of five) "},{"Title":"Not great but definitely good.","Date":"25 May 2000","Score":"","Genre":"Drama, Comedy","Review":"  We all know how great Kevin Spacey is but what really impressed me was that I saw Danny Devito act like an adult for the first time.

I checked his filmography to be sure.And, I've got to admit, the play on which this film is based is probably a good one; it just doesn't work as a movie.  I've not read or seen the play, but, from the movie, I can tell you two things it with relative certainty1)  It takes place entirely in one room.2)  It has three acts.Why am I so confident?  Well, because The Big Kahuna still looks like a play and not a movie, for it all takes place in a single hospitality suite, you see.  Sure, on rare occasions a character is shown outside of the room, often depicted in a ridiculously unnecessary slow motion shot, but the two remaining characters (there are only three that matter) usually chatter on anyway.  In fact, while we're on the subject of slow motion, let me mention that I really tend to hate it, especially in this movie.  There's actually more than one shot of Peter Facinelli talking to another person in slow motion - more than one!You can't blame the actors here, though.  All three of them give quality performances, but the movie is incapable, by its very nature, of engaging an audience at all.  It's the kind of play that would probably be absorbing if you saw it in a small community theater, but on screen, it's boring.Worst of all, though, is the fact that the last two minutes of the film involve the three characters walking around while that intolerable Baz Luhrmann song (the one about wearing sunscreen) plays in the background.  I mean, that song's annoying, and haven't they been using it in car commercials lately?  5/10, but strictly because the acting is so good "}{"Title":"All Talk","Date":"22 May 2000","Score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama, Comedy","Review":"  Take a stage play called Hospitality Suite and transform it to screen with expectations, no doubt, that it might be another Glass Menagerie or Glengary Glen Ross.  Everything exist in the dialogue so it should be kept fresh and spontaneous.  If the film writer has a message, keep it understandable because lacking much action, the viewer's mind can only stand so much talk.  The Big Kahuna, unfortunately, is a freely spouting rhetorical movie which exists on a plane too high to be understood.  It is simply a victim of the very dishonesty it is trying to castigate.  Like Bob, the religious zealot who becomes an enigma,  this movie doesn't really define what it stands for. We can't fault the actors for trying. Kevin Spacey, as Larry, is the freewheeling, in your face, kind of guy who has seen enough of selling to know what is honest and what isn't.  Danny Devito, as Phil, is the beaten-down, apathetic figure who sees young Bob as the one pristine soul he might have a chance to save from life's ravages.  And Peter Facinelli as Bob, the one dimensional man,is the worse of all worlds - a generic salesman without a soul.  The Big Kahuna is about many things - life and death, commitment, friendship, and betrayal, but after all the verbage, it should have left us with a clearer message, not something nebulous and floating in the air.

The time these 3 individuals spend together at this hotel in Wichita, selling lubricants, is mostly spent talking to each other. In the course of talking, they begin to open up about their lives, their thoughts, their opinions and aspirations and their own personal histories. It is just one of those things where at the time it can be very deep and powerful, but it ends up as just another piece of the pie (or puzzle, if you like) which is life. Existence. The whole point of the movie is, I feel, to comment on the reality of being alive and being a human being in today's world. It ends open-ended as a starting point for the viewers' own introspection to begin.

I appreciate work like this. My Rating9/10. Good all around. It, to me, is not the type of a movie one should judge as being bad, or great, or anything in between for the sake of entertainment. Rather, we the viewers should judge it as a point of contemplation on what it is to be a person and appreciate it for that. A piece for a Humanities class to watch and discuss. Possibly much more.

More than this, the viewer wants to hear what the characters have to say because very early on it is evident that there is an excellent screenplay at work here--one that asks many more questions than it answers, and one that couldn't be more demanding in making the viewer think.Secondly, it exemplifies, by far, the best work Danny Devito has ever done.

He plays his character--a marketing executive at a personal and spiritual crossroads--with unflinching realism and conviction.  Kevin Spacey, as his eccentric, yet ultimately sincere friend, is at his best as always.

Based on the play 'Hospitality Suite' this was wisely still performed as though it was a play, with very little in the way of shots outside the hotel suite where the three main players are staying for the duration of the convention.  If you give Kevin Spacey good dialogue then he can always be relied upon to deliver, and this he does, in spades.  However, Danny de Vito was an absolute revelation as the tired, vulnerable divorced salesman who reveals a depth of understanding of other people's vulnerability and failings that's at odds with his perceived persona.  The friendship between him and Spacey, and the way de Vito's character grows as Spacey's shrinks, is wonderful to watch.  The third character, the God-loving, upright and morally superior young man, serves as a catalyst for the character development in the film, but he too changes - or changes in the eyes of the viewers - as the film moves towards its end.

The location for the film was exactingly placed in a bland hotel in bland Wichita, Kansas, a worthy stand-in metaphor for the nothingness of existence where the great things of life are in very short supply for these two good friends who are impatiently waiting for the fabled company president Dick Fuller to arrive to provide that life saving big sale that would give them new purpose and reason to feel good about themselves again. Who would ever guess that a big order for industrial lubricants could do that? Transferring very intelligent and talky plays to the screen often doesn't work well, but when it does it is magical and deeply involving. It worked so very well here, and intelligently so, as Spacey and DeVito were wonderful playing off each other as salesmen friends so familiar that talk between them was almost like talking to oneself, or at least to one's wife. It was obvious that they loved each other as well as most marrieds do, as much of their dialogue was similar to that of a married couple, and the story's diverse philosophical meanderings that ranged from marketing to religion to love to marriage to character and to, of course, the meaning of life and the real value of shrimp versus cheese ball snacks, were all the more effective due not only to the well crafted script, but also due to the world-weary resignation of the lead characters playing off their near opposite, a wet-behind-the ears, young company research newbie named Bob who was oddly sent with them to the convention. Bob was innocently sincere and mostly good hearted, but at the same time was cocky and smug about things he knew almost nothing about but thought he knew so well. His gently delivered, but harsh and well-earned comeuppance at the end from DeVito's Phil was the one great thing that I knew all along was coming, and I was so glad when it came down hard on this naive, supercilious, and self-righteous member of the fundamental religious right. But sadly, as he dumbly disagreed with his comeuppance details that were so obviously dead on, Bob was not at that time wise enough to know that he had so much more to learn over the years before he could claim possession of any appreciable amount of human character. From this, such familiar feelings were surely evoked in all of us who once happened to be similarly young and naive as Bob is here. And, as it turned out the same way as in much of real life, the big sale was not made. Or.... was it? Truly a philosophical thinking person's film and one to be seen again and again for full value.There was a bit of resolve in what served as an epilogue, as it showed that these three ended up pretty much the same as they began, but somewhat tweaked for the better. Hopefully, like we all do.

The anger by Kevin Spacey, the blind insistence of Peter Facinelli and the despair by Danny DeVito are very well portrayed. The dialog is outstanding. They consists of winding but witty lines, which are very well composed. The dialog may seem to lack direction at times, but in fact they bring out themes of emotion, goals, responsibility, dreams and religion. Despite the fact that most scenes occur in one room, and there are only three main actors, the film is gripping and never bores. It compensates itself by the acting and the intense dialog that never seems to even pause. In addition, not so many films explore this many topics at once like this film does!

The exchanges of insults, arguments and egos draws you straight into the storyline. Kevin Spacey, at his usual gifted self, combines parts of characters from his other movies such as Swimming with Sharks and Glengary Glen Ross to give a power-house performance as the ultimate salesman. Dany Devito however steals the show and put's in one of his best performances as a middle-aged salesman beginning to understand what's really important in life. Peter Facinelli, whom I've never seen in any other movie, is completely believable as a rookie trying to learn the ropes from the best in the trade. Being surrounded by giants such as Spacey and Devito, you can see this young actor is really intimidated, but uses it to his advantage to make his character more vulnerable than the others. The trade-offs between him and Spacey are mesmerising.Set against the backdrop of a hotel, the three main characters try everything to land the biggest client of their sales careers. The desperate salesman theme is explored in all it's forms, as is the experienced Vs rookie theme. Combined with an outstanding script, this makes for one of the most intellectually engaging and brilliantly acted performances in this genre.Without boring the audience, each character is given exceptional depth and allows you to relate to how they feel. Each character experiences a roller-coaster of emotions, upsets and victories.Ultimately, I find parallels between this film and one of Devito's other films Tin Men that also deals with the same themes of unscrupulous sales people within a dog-eat-dog industry.This movie has a brilliant script and is definitely worth watching if you like intellectually stimulating movies. It will leave you thinking about things for a long time to come.

No really, he is.","Date":"5 June 2002","Score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama, Comedy","Review":"  I can't believe that i would be the only one to notice the subtle reference to Danny DeVito's character being gay. I've read through quite a few reviews on imdb as well as looked for reviews with search engines. I saw two gay movie review sites and neither even hinted at the notion. Well, perhaps that's what a little aided expansion of the consciousness Will do for you.Another neglected element is DeVito's whole retelling of his childhood dream, and this has direct bearing on the issue above. If one is completely locked onto this film with his full psyche, he will experience the awful, apocalyptic gloom and sheer visual imagery of the dream, almost a vision. It was one of the, dare i say, high points of the movie. DeVito finds God in a closet in a burned out hotel in the middle of a city laid to waste. And God is scared. DeVito takes him by the hand and leads him 'out of the closet'. Together, still hand in hand (two males?... i, traditionally, assume), they look out over the darkened ruins of the city.That city was Wichita, KS (and also someone's burnt out life). That closet, while at first guess seeming to be the one Spacey wheeled out of the room, is really the room itself. Remember Spacey, upon entering the room in the first place, called it a 'closet' to show his disgust with the room's diminutive size. The god in the closet, scared, was none other than DeVito's character himself. And therein lies the answer to the surface question (well, surface in terms of where the obvious undercurrent of this film lies) Who is The Big Kahuna? A) God, and B) Ourselves... if we look for God externally we will only find stars and gases and nebulae. God resides in humanity, in each of us. At the same time, though, it answers another, and actually more pertinent, question What's Eating Gilbert Grape? (Gilbert Grape being Danny DeVito's character, of course). The answer? That he has finally come to terms with his homosexuality. This is the real reason why he has finally left his wife (regrets allow honesty to tattoo itself across your face-or something close to that. that was another pinnacle in DeVito's career.) This is the real reason we see DeVito truly reading Penthouse, not just looking at it (observe the content on the pages he is looking at... text, not skin-toned glossies). This is the real reason he asks Spacey if Spacey loves him. And perhaps why he considers suicide, briefly, as many homosexuals have done (as well as a boatload of heteros as well). I also find it entertaining, if not downright foreshadowing, when Spacey asks the Baptist Bible Boy, just kidding, the religious devotee, if HE is gay.Well, what can i say? Either I am brilliantly imaginative but dead wrong, or keenly observant and, like a cat's eye, able to discern things in the dimmest of light. You decide.

Well, guess what?  The movie is a play too. It's almost like watching a bootleg video tape of a play.  The entire movie takes place in two rooms a hotel suite and its bathroom (and ocassionally in a bar, hallway, and another hotel room, but only rarely).  The movie has some great writing and some terrific acting.  It touches right on the Religious vs. every thing else issue.This movie had a more personal touch to me because a friend of mine is exactly like the character of Bob Walker.  He is so religious that he carries a Bible with him everywhere he goes.  I know that some of you are thinking that's great!, but when you have to live with it, for years and years, it gets old and stupid.  Kevin Spacey's character reminds me of myself.  I can't understand why someone would make themselves that blind to life and, most of all, that boring.  Religious people are the most boring people of all.  I don't mean people who love God a lot, I mean people like my friend who have unhealthy obsessions with it.  Trust me, I see a lot of these people and they get old quick.  Oh well, whatever floats your boat I guess.Well, enough rabling about my worthless life.  The movie has a problem, it's boring.  I love slowpaced movies.  But this is a little too slow.  It's not that the movie never really leaves a hotel room.  12 Angry men ONLY takes place in two rooms, and it is one of the greatest thillers of all time.

Kevin Spacey plays an unscrupulous salesman whose only goal is to receive the account from a very prestigious client.  He won't let anything stand in his way.  And after this potential client accidentally slipped through his fingers (he failed to wear his own nametag) he goes ballistic.  He goes even more ballistic after discovering that the new guy in the agency (Peter Facinelli) chatted with the man, and failed to mention the lubricant, which they are selling.It's really intense to watch the ideals of Spacey and Facinelli clash.  They both feel strongly about their points.  Facinelli was deep in a conversation about religion with this potential client, and he found nothing wrong with failing to mention lubricants while discussing Jesus Christ.  Spacey feels that business should've been the Number One virtue and that God (and all religious discussion) should take a back seat.  Danny DeVito is also impressive as the come-between.  He's a veteran in the business, and though he sometimes despises Spacey, he believes he has some good ideas and admires his honesty.  He also admires Facinelli, but disagrees on the way he preaches religion, and believes that's no different than preaching about the lubricant.As I always said, NOBODY can play an unscrupulous character better than Kevin Spacey!  There is no one who could've been better for the role.  This is one role that was made for him.  He's one of my favorite actors, and I was glad to see him turn in yet another powerful performance.  He delivers his dialogue with such precision, respecting every word of dialogue, and saying it all with perfect timing.  DeVito shows us again (he did it last time with Jack the Bear) that he can play a dramatic role just as well as a comic role.  He is extraordinary in this movie, just like the other two actors.  Peter Facinelli turns in a surprisingly subtle and brilliant performance, and it was a blessing after watching him play the cardboard, one-dimensional dumb jock in Can't Hardly Wait, a role that could've been played by an orangutan.  He didn't get the chance to flaunt his acting chops in that awful comedy, and I'm so glad he redeems himself in this movie, showing us he can play ADULT roles and do it very well.This is a thoughtful, frank, take-no-prisoners drama about the business world and humanity.  It shows us what can happen when we let certain values overshadow our real goals in life.  This character study is universal, it can pertain to any area of life, not just the business world.  And I think the screenwriter Roger Rueff did a great job at executing the morals he wanted to express.  This is a deep, moving, powerful film that I will remember, and I wish I could've seen the play also so I can feel the energy of the actors burst from the stage (one of the advantages of watching a theatrical production).

However, the role that sold me into this movie was that of Peter Facinelli. This young actor was terrific as the modest, religious novice salesman. Even though it was an enjoyable little film, I did think that it could have used a better story line. You will be surprised to find out that the best part of the film is during the end credits. For that sole reason, you must purchase your tickets now to go see `The Big Kahuna.' *** Average  "},{"Title":"One of the best","Date":"14 September 2000","Score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama, Comedy","Review":"    The Big Kahuna does not go boom.

It's the dialogue and witty reparte showcased by Kevin Spacey and Danny Devito that grab you and don't let you go. It's honest and earnest, and, boy, that's rarer than you might think these days. For an hour and a half you get to see a bit of three fellas' souls. I was completely knocked out by Danny Devito. It's his movie. He owns it and to take a movie away from Kevin Spacey (the ultimate screen stealer), is really saying something. It's the best performance Danny Devito has ever pulled off. He delivers one of the best speeches near the end that I've ever heard in a movie. The Big Kahuna is easily one of the best movies I've seen this year.

The similarities are striking there is one set, a minimum of characters and physical action, the action takes place in the dialogue, and there is a contest of ideas. Kahuna ends up being an entertaining film while Andre was astounding. In movie comedies, often there is one multi-dimensional character (in this case DeVito) interacting with others who are stereotyped and cartoon-like, in this case Spacey and Peter Fascinelli.  Spacey plays a variation on one of the late Phil Hartman's characters, here a fast-talking, wise-cracking, sardonic manufacturer's rep.  Fascinelli plays a young, naive fundamentalist Christian who uses every opportunity to proselytize others.  The three actors, DeVito, Spacey, and Fascinelli were all well cast and good in their roles.The film has a lot of catchy one-liners about gender differences that women may enjoy.  It's entertaining to see a film about a contest of ideas.  The ideas, however, were stated fuzzily and I was disappointed that the issue of Fascinelli's character using the company money, resources, and time to advance his own  personal beliefs was not better highlighted (perhaps as ...render unto Caesar that which is Caesar, and unto God that  which is God's...).  Ah, well; it induced that question within me and if it did so within much of the audience, perhaps that's as good as a more obvious slap in the face message.

It isn't my least favorite film, the fact that I managed to sit through it should be an indication that I've seen worse. And worse there is, as 'The Big Kahuna' did have positive traits, no matter how slight they are.	Though their characters were annoying and hard to spend two hours with, Spacey and Devito both turned in alright performances, much better than a script of this caliber deserves. Facinelli is the weak link here, not at all interesting, and a horrible protagonist. One of the rules of writing a script is to have the main character learn something and change throughout the picture. The characters in 'The Big Kahuna' fail miserably at that, sad when you realize the talent associated with the picture.	You do have to give the producers credit for being able to wrap up shooting so quickly, the entire shoot was only 18 days. Still, Spacey's earlier 'Swimming With Sharks' (one of my favorite films) was shot in two days less, yet somehow seems less artificial. The entirity of 'The Big Kahuna' takes place in one set (a hotel room), with very few pans and no zooming at all, making the movie almost as boring as the tired screenplay.	Though the movie is billed as a comedy, there is not a single laugh to be found in the entire movie.I seriously recommend against seeing this movie, especially if you're not a fan of Spacey or Devito.2.0/10 "},{"Title":"Mixed","Date":"31 May 2000","Score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama, Comedy","Review":"  Today I went to see the movie, based solely on the two main characters, Kevin Spacey and Danny DeVito, whom I have held in high esteem for their dedication to their craft.

For me, this film projected the philosophy of life, friendship, and in some instances, even love. The truth behind all this is, is that the film in itself was very simple. Only 3 charactars to play main roles, (you see them and only them in the ENTIRE film-this means 2hrs!) and these 3 characters each had a spiritual connection/nay say bond towards each other, in that each of them were alone in the world, searching for the meaning of life, God, and love for each other as friends would. Lets strat with danny Devito, he plays a man who has just lost his wife to divorce, has a regular amount of friends in his life, but Kevin Spacey seems to stand out as someone who is honest, truthful, caring, and respectful, to others that know him best. Devito's charactar stood out for a main reason. He realizes the meaning of his existence, the philosophy behind his calling, through his pain and bond he forms, (I take back, what I said in the beginning, it has got charactar devlopment)with Spacey that develops in to something deeper; True Friendship. Lets look at Spacey. Here we find a man pretty much disciplined to his work, is very experienced, and seems to be the least sentimental about himself compared to the other 2 players in the film. He gave up smoking for a reason not mentioned, but looks as though he wants to find peace and equality, through a true friendship, with either Devito or the new kid. Spacey, I belive, fills the extra middle of the film, trying to express the meaning of hard work, putting yourself in the right position to do your work, (in his case Marketing) and drawing the line between (this is VERY complicated to explain and comprehend) talking about genral life, and personal life. i.e., when you are talking individually with another person about bussiness, talk about bussiness! He says not to talk about the wrong subject in the wrong place, that dont fit together, because you end up selling what you are talking about. selling meaning a sales picth. This leads directly into, the new kid, Bob. Bob is an unexperinced amatuer to the world of advertising and business, and he fills this up with his own belefies, that he STANDS UP FOR. Jesus. God. Religon. At one point in the end of the film, he is sent to talk to a president of the biggest company, in the Mid-west, and talks for 4 hours to the guy about Jesus and Religon. When he returns, spacey and Devito get all over him about what he talked about, and how it mattered to boost their business. He procceds to explain that they chatted about Religon and God and things, and this is the point in the film where the meaning of the story is tied in an argument. Spacey gets mad at him, because Bob is too ametuer to understand that when you have work to be done, it has to be done in the right place and the right time, and that you cant talk about a different subject in a different setting. They scramble on the floor, and Devito jumps in. He then clarifies what Spacey was explaining. Bob was also against/abolished the use of looking at other women when you are married, or with someone. He projects the patrt of the film that is based on belief and freedom of belief in something that is righfully yours. of course, that cant interfere with your work, but the fact that he did, demonstrates the right to your beliefs. So, each charactar has some thing to prove. Devito Philosophy of love bonded with the spiritual meaning of friendship and God/life. Spacey Setting of your life, of your work. To put your beliefs aside for the moment, and to focus in on what is being done at the moment, or else you will turn the stated subject into something being sold. Bob Rights to belief, Confidence in what you belive is right. Yes, this film was very well made, despite 3 characters and one setting. (Can you belive this was a playact? 3 people on stage!) It had enormous potential towards philosophy of life, had some funny moments, but IT IS NOT A COMEDY. Keep this in mind. THIS FILM IS REALLY SERIOUS. if you dont think you will understand it, dont see it!!! Kevin Spacey, again, makes for a great time, so does Devito and the other guy.

I found these sentiments echoed in a powerful speech Danny DeVito's character Phil gives to Peter Facinelli's character, Bob, towards the end of this filmed play. Here, Phil delivers a wise but not wizened discourse on a level of truth that Bob in his Christian evangelical zeal (he happens to be a Christian, but he could have been from any tradition) cannot yet see, which is that Bob has regrets, but has not arrived at a point where he can acknowledge them.This is a bold and brave film, set in a hospitality suite (the name, in fact, of the original play of Roger Rueff's that he adapted for the screen) with three salesmen  Phil, a middle aged man with too many years on the road, trying to recover from the shreds of a mid-life crisis; Bob, a Christian evangelical, a misplaced tech at the very beginning of his career; and Larry, a wired, overly driven man who seems in part like a refugee from the sales company from Glengary/Glenross played with a potent combination of irony and passion by Kevin Spacey.Roger Ebert makes the cogent observation that Phil and Larry on the one hand, and Bob on the other, are both sales reps from their respective religions  for the first two, it's sales; for Bob, its his religion.  I agree, but I think its possible to take it one level deeper, which is that all are trying to find God, a sense of connectedness, and an overall sense of existential meaning and purpose.  I don't think it's accidental that many biblical references are made by all concerned during the course of the film; in fact, at one point I had a fantasy that if you deleted the profanity, this production could easily have emanated from the talented hands of an educational wing of a major religious denomination.The Big Kahuna is a potential buyer who could land the protagonists on easy street.  Yet, what emerges is a metaphor of ultimacy  what constitutes the Big Kahuna, i.e. that which constitutes the central purpose of their lives, gives meaning, and  propels them toward the natural destination of their dreams and aspirations, (as well as how they orient themselves to these concerns), is really the focus of this film.Themes of love and faith are collaboratively explored here  commitment to job at the expense of Phil's marriage; the possibility that Larry and Phil could genuinely care about one another as both colleagues and friends after a multi-decade association in a way that transcends both business and practical concerns; and that Bob could also transcend his self-righteous and barely concealed smug and self satisfied attachment to his pure faith, marriage, family, and general bearing of perfect rectitude.  Phil later challenges Bob to evolve past his ego ideal and attachment of the perfect Christian and move to a greater capacity to gain perspective, compassion, and with it, a more far reaching humanity to be able to connect from his heart.A favorite quote of mine of many years comes from R.D. Laing, who wrote in the Politics of Experience  We all live in the hope that authentic meeting between people can still occur.  Past the grind of the road, the weariness of a thousand throbbing hand shakes; a million hospitality suites and warn pillow cases for weary heads too dead (as Dylan might have said) for dreaming, are people hungering for connection  with God; with another; with themselves.  And the hope that such connection might occur past ideology or soul-numbing pursuit is what, for me, this film is all about.It's a gorgeous piece of work.Fred  "},{"Title":"Great!","Date":"20 May 2000","Score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama, Comedy","Review":"  Although it would seem to be very difficult for Kevin Spacey to brilliantly follow-up American Beauty, he did.

I'm thinking of CS Lewis' idea here of walking down a long twisting mountain road (that twists one time around) towards a great shining city in the valley. (the city represents God) The Christian is graced with being near the top of the mountain, and full of joy from having a brilliant view of the city. The non-Christian is further down the road, and on the other side of the mountain, and can see nothing but darkness. Yet he is the one actually closer (physical proximity wise) to God. Meanwhile the Christian is waiting, in pure love considering jumping off to fly right down to the city.. (although God may blow him about for a while in the sky far above the city and in the clouds without letting him land ;) So the non-Christian saying, I really don't know if God is real, I don't know if Jesus is God. is saying this, from a perspective of honesty that is as real as God when speaking.

"},{"Title":"The Big Bore","Date":"15 January 2007","Score":"0 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama, Comedy","Review":" This is a talky, pretentious film that actors love and audiences ignore. Kevin Spacey and Danny DeVito play experienced salesmen who go to Kansas City for a sales conference. Peter Facinelli plays the new guy. You know, the one that's supposed to learn the ropes from the old vets only he has his own style and way of doing things? Yes, it is well acted. Unless he goes the chew the scenery route, Spacey almost can't be bad. DeVito's worst tendencies are left behind here and he does a good job playing the wounded, vulnerable Phil. But its still a snooze-fest.It might be noted that this is the first movie for director John Swainbeck, and eight years later, still his ONLY directing credit. That might tell you something about the pace and direction of this dreary film. But he had a great road map in trying to create a dull film the script.This is only for the hard core Spacey or Devito fans.

What it is, is just a retread of Glengarry  Glen Ross, the characters have the  same goal, but its just not done as well in this  film.  Kevin Spacey gives a very good performance, but thats about it.   If you  really like him, you may enjoy this little film.  My IMDB rating 5.8/10 "},{"Title":"Excellent - but not for those looking for a fun film","Date":"21 September 2000","Score":"0 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama, Comedy","Review":"  Powerful, thoughtful, wise, moving and incredibly well acted this film rates high in my book.  But it is a movie for when one is in a contemplative mood, not for those looking for an explosive diversion from real life.  Hope to see an Oscar nod or two for this one.

Kevin Spacey and Danny DiVitto are wonderful actors, and nothing here says any different. They both contribute the kinds of quality performances we have come to admire and expect from them.The screenplay, however, deserved none of their labors. It is preachy, and proselytizing tripe, which has no business on any theater screen, much less MY television set. The story centers around a deluded rose-colored-glasses kid who still has his head in the clouds and doesn't realize that religion and business do NOT mix. Instead of doing his job, he openly proselytizes with the clients, and then rebels against the disparaging opinions of his betters, when they discover what he has been up to.I was neither amused, nor entertained, though DiVitto and Spacey turned in beautiful performances.It rates a 3.9/10 from...the Fiend .

Kevin Spacey,Danny Devito,and Peter Francelli are the only ppl who star in the movie. It takes place in a kansas hotel room and all thy do is just talk. that's all they do throughout the whole movie. Kevin Spacey went ballistic over a plate of food asparagus(plz excuse my spelling)in American Beauty,then in this movie he holds up a carrot stick and Devito says what R U doing with my hor d'ouvres? I'm warning u! Plz think b4 watching! Watch some good movies like throw momma from the train. 1 1/2 hours of talk,no action. My Rating0/10. "}]
