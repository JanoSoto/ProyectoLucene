[{"Title":"Spacey and Hallstrom shine in a moving story","Date":"18 July 2002","Score":"78 out of 86 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama","Review":"  Director Lasse Halstrom continues to prove himself to be outstanding at presenting sensitive human dramas with this touching film about a broken man's retreat to his ancestral roots.  This poignant tale unwinds deliberately and delicately as each of the main characters shares his or her dark secrets buried in the past.Halstrom is an inspired actors' director who entices outstanding performances from his troupe.  He has a wonderful ability to make simple characters appear bigger than life.  I continue to admire his unobtrusive presentation, forgoing ostentatious directorial stylizing in favor of simple shots that let the story and the characters dominate.  The cinematography and choice of locations in this film are understated and lovely without the need for garishness.The acting is superb.  Kevin Spacey, as Quoyle, once again shows his range, taking on an emotionally crippled character that is quite unlike the confident and clever characters that jump off his resume.   Spacey relinquishes all traces of the cockiness that is his trademark and brilliantly renders a pathetic nebbish whose greatest daily struggle is to overcome his own ennui.   For Spacey to suppress his natural dynamism to slip this character on so effectively is a testimony to his excellence as an actor.While this is clearly Spacey's film, the supporting cast of accomplished veterans weaves a splendid tapestry.  Julianne Moore is excellent as Quoyle's love interest with a delicate portrayal of a character that is simultaneously supportive and insecure.  Judi Dench is marvelous as Quoyle's crusty old aunt, who drags him back to Newfoundland to find himself among the ashes of his unseemly clan.  Cate Blanchett is bodacious as the impulsive vamp who ravishes Quoyle and stays with him only long enough to give him a daughter.  Scott Glenn is terrific as the cantankerous publisher of the local newspaper who turns Quoyle from a typesetter into a reporter.This film is not for everyone.  It is extremely deliberate and will fray the patience of the average viewer.  However, for those who have a love of human interest stories with flawed but lovable characters, this will be a treat.  I rated it a 9/10.  It is a gem of human foibles and interactions that is moving and insightful.

Director Hallstrom gathered the best cast and crew he could find for this film. The cinematography is glorious - I can't believe Oliver Stapleton isn't up for every award in the world.  Kevin Spacey turns in the best performance of his career as a brutalized man, Cate Blanchett is her usual chameleon self as his trashy girlfriend, Julianne Moore is perfection as the woman who helps him heal, and Judi Dench is funny and touching as his aunt. Hers is a role without a huge amount of lines but tons of substance.  Only a master could have given the character such depth.The Shipping News has poignancy, humor and a great deal of beauty.  What it has above all else is atmosphere - Hallstrom's feel for the Newfoundland shipping village, the simple lives led there and the friendships made is truly awe-inspiring.

Such is an example with the poignant, touching and often funny film, The Shipping News.The Shipping News is film about loss, recovery, pain, but most of all, recovery. When a person loses a loved one, or in this case, a person who loses someone they think they love, it comes with a package of emotional stress and remorse. The person they lose is immortalized within their thoughts, usually in a positive, memorable perspective.The story begins with a narration by Quoyle (Spacey), and through this depressing and self defeating narration, we learn that Quoyle is man who has never succeeded in anything, is a failure in his family's eyes, and has never accomplished one thing in his entire life. He struggles through every miserable task he is given, he aches at the thought of one more day.As a defeated man who has never loved, never laughed, and never succeeded, he is desperate for something, desperate for someone. When he meets a woman named Petal (Blanchett) he thinks he's in love. We see a woman who is looking for a costumer, looking for someone to spend the night with. Quoyle sees a wife, someone to spend the rest of his life with. So without hesitation, he takes a swing at this wild tiger. He thinks he has achieved that echelon of happiness. He has a darling little girl, he has a wife, and he has a steady job. But he soon learns that one person, a person he has known for little over a few years, can turn his life upside down. After a realistic and inevitable chain of events, he is back to his pitiful little life. Only this time, he's lost more than he can handle. His own emotional attachments have become his own emotional destruction.In the midst of these happenings, Quoyle is met at the door by his Aunt Agnis (Dench), whom he has never met. She suggests they begin a new future, for she too has lost something. She decides that they should travel to their native roots, in Newfoundland. The future looks bleak to Quoyle, but only the happiest of times look ahead to Agnis. At least from our perspective.Throughout the film we are met by several supporting characters played by familiar and not so familiar actors. These characters, while they may seem supporting, play the largest part in the film. For these characters are the building blocks which help Quoyle begin his `transformation'. These are the people which help Quoyle recognize his roots and why he must belong there. Throughout these characters, we are met with many intertwining storylines which could make a whole entire film by themselves. But these characters are all here to help one man find a reason. A reason for being.Throughout this masterful tale of loss, recovery, and pain, we discover that problems exist within problems. We learn that the future may result in failure, but will always have an answer. The answer lies within Quoyle himself. While these supporting players may have an impact on Quoyle's job and home, Quoyle is the only one who can help find happiness for himself.With a star-studded cast which shines with the inspiring score by Christopher Young, Lasse Hallstrom has created a film which should not be overlooked, but should be look upon as a film which displays how courage, love, and faith, can overcome loss, struggle, and pain.

As in American Beauty, we hear Kevin Spacey's exhausted voice-over telling us how he was physically mishandled by his father and how empty his life is now. A brief marriage to a half-mad Kate Blanchett results in a child, Bunny, but it doesn't seem to help Spacey. At his father's funeral he runs into an aunt from a Canadian maritime province and, having no particular reason for existence in upstate New York, travels home with her.That's when the story proper begins to get a bit more lively. This is a barren windswept place, tucked so far up into the northern latitudes that even at noon objects leave long shadows on the salt grass. People fish in this small village. They eat seal flipper pies made of the more cartilaginous parts of the fin. People speak with a kind of mid-Atlantic accent and they have queer names like Card and Buggitt and Quoyle. The town seems so dull that one day the tide may go out and never come back. But it's livelier than it sounds underneath those lowering skies. Spacey gets a job at the local newspaper, The Gammy Bird or something like that. Well, okay, it's not the New York Times, but even the Pt. Reyes Lighthouse won a Pulitzer a few years ago. His assignment write the shipping news, detailing which ships enter and leave port, and throw in any relevant bits of information. Also cover the regular car wrecks. Spacey runs into the couple who have just brought a yacht into harbor, a yacht that was built for Adolph Hitler, and does a story on it, much to the pleasure of the editor (Scott Glenn) who spends most of his time fishing. His career as journalist progresses, punctuated by the headlines he gradually learns to compose. An older colleague takes him to the shore, tells him to look at the horizon, and describe what he sees. There are some mountains -- and a lot of dark clouds, ventures Spacey. Nope IMMINENT STORM THREATENS VILLAGE, says his mentor. But what if it doesn't come? Spacey asks. Answer DANGEROUS STORM SPARES VILLAGE.There's a lot of humor in this film actually but none of it is played for laughs. It's the kind of humor that grows out of everyday encounters, unremarked upon but palpably there. Much of it is provided by the headlines. After some social coup, Spacey smiles with satisfaction and muses, CLUMSY MAN STUNS CROWD. (It's a little like the Windbag chapter in Ulysses.)Spacey also runs into Julianne Moore, than whom there is no less glamorous or more talented actress on screen these days, who has a retarded child and a punk history of her own. The romance moves slowly and tentatively along as it might in life outside of the movies. The couple do not throw themselves into bed on their first night together and dissolve in an ecstasy of sighs and moans. But it's basically the story of Spacey's self discovery. Nothing as simple as, EMPTY MAN GOES HOME AND FINDS HIS ROOTS. Not a bit of it. His family has a lunatic and criminal history on these islands and the secrets are uncovered bit by bit, a patchwork of incest, rape, torture, piracy, and murder, all symbolized by a dreary haunted-looking old house anchored to the stone shore by steel cables and turnbuckles to hold it against the storms. Well, a storm finally does lash the village. I was in such a storm, a hurricane in fact, in a small seaside village outside of Pago Pago in American Samoa. After a day and a night of savagery the dawn came and I was amazed after I'd crawled out from what was left of the place into the crisp new air -- trees down, bushes blasted away, huts shredded, and a majestic vista now that so many obstructions had been flattened. Something like that happens here. The final headline STORM DESTROYS HOUSE. LEAVES EXCELLENT VIEW. I can't NOT mention Kevin Spacey's performance. He's so wispy and insensate at the beginning that he barely exists. He's heavier than usual here and walks in a fitting fashion. Now this is much tougher than what Russell Crowe did with his shambling in A Beautiful Mind, or Dustin Hoffman's tics in Rain Man, because Spacey has not to EMBODY a mental illness but to suggest a spiritual one. His performance is as close to perfection as it's possible to imagine, although by definition it must lack bravura. Moore is first rate, as usual, her flattish face almost luminous with sensibility, and the smaller parts are just fine. So is the direction. Spacey has, by my count, three nightmares about his childhood and not once does he wake up and thrust his face into the camera and scream. The score is understated during the film but rackets along behind the credits percussively in something like 6/8 time. See this if you can, really, for an acting lesson if for no other reason, as long as you don't expect to find a slasher crawling through a fish factory with a chef's knife.

I sense the movie missed the point here. Kevin Spacey does an admirable job with the difficult role of Quoyle, he is shot from strange angles to emphasize a height and width that is not there in real life.  I had envisioned Gerard Depardieu in the role, big, hulking and awkward. I note also that one of the daughters was dropped from the movie, there are two in the book. Judi Dench's performance is incredible and her tough almost fatalistic Newfoundland character feels real.  Moore is a disappointment, far too beautiful for the role and not as mysterious as depicted in the book.  The scenery is incredible, wild and isolated.  I enjoyed the soundtrack and the minor characters, all very well acted.  I gave it an 8  out of 10 for the fabulous cinematography and Judi Dench.

Furthermore we got supporting actresses such as the lovely Julianne Moore and talented Cate Blanchett, it was promising.The movie is mostly a drama, but it succeeds in giving the audience some laughs when needed, which is important to me. Dramas can be too depressing sometimes, but it is of course sometimes needed to make a statement. Anyway, it is not needed in Shipping News and Lasse Hallström understands this very well.The acting is great, the stars I mentioned earlier deliver good performances, but we also get the pleasure to watch other good actors too, so the cast really gives us a good movie.Actually there are mainly positive things to say about this movie, the picture quality was good and the environment at Newfoundland created a good atmosphere. The only thing I would critisise is that the movie maybe could have been a bit longer, there were a few issues that I would like to have seen sorted out.I have rated this movie 7/10, but it maybe deserved a little more.

Those familiar with Proulx's visceral scripting of lives -not-so-ordinary-in-reality will be pleasantly coddled as her Shipping News characters are brought to amazing life at the hands of some our time's finest actors; Dame Judi Dench, Julianne Moore, Cate Blanchett and Kevin Spacey. Each is known for disappearing into their roles, and with the combination of Proulx's perfect characters (misfits) the actors seemed engulfed. Quoyle (Kevin-- clearing a spot for a few award trinkets as we speak- Spacey) is a sad, nearly nonexistent man. He gets no respect from anyone he holds near and dear. He's a guy you pass on the street and may remark at, if only to notice how sad he appears. His life is nothing spectacular. His story? His story is another kettle of boiling water all together&#133;His life takes a few dramatic turns as we meet him. His gallivanting wife Petal (Cate Blanchett) has absconded with their young daughter Bunny and his parents have done something equally dramatic. The events find him thrown together with his tough-as-nails Newfoundland born aunt Agnis Hamm (Dame Judi Dench). With his run of luck at the deeper end of long over, she invites him to try a fresh start, up there.He's got nothing to lose so follows her up to his family's historic birthplace. A barren rock his people called home, only forty odd years ago, called Killick-Claw. Think, middle of nowhere with fantastic cliff and ocean views and the restaurant is the only restaurant. Small, quaint and a perfect place to hide from your troubles and the world.He and his precocious, and sensitive, daughter Bunny are adjusting and getting to know their new neighbors on the small hamlet, that appears to never see the season of summer.Quoyle is experiencing a newfound meaning to life (his life especially)in Newfoundland. He is hired as a small-time reporter for the local rag-mag and community pulse serving paper The Gammy Bird. His writing starts to affect all aspects of his mundane life.He also meets an equally sad and sullen gal named Wavey (Julianne Best Actress 2002 Moore). She' s a widow who wears her heart on her sleeve and is weary of starting any new romances. Poor Quoyle. Mysterious happenings and awakenings start to emerge all around Quoyle as well as a new sense of self, friendships and life. What's it mean?The Shipping News is old time story telling at it's finest. Newfoundland in itself is a bit of a mystical place to most of us. Proulx creates her story's characters so rich in dimension with that same timeless appeal like a Huck Finn or Nicholas Nickleby, one expects to look them up in the local phone book when in town. But it's the subtle expert performances for subtle yet animated characters make this simply a masterpiece. The award shows are going to be quite redundant this year... A Beautiful Mind and its wonderful cast and performances will be The Shipping News' only competition in the BIG 3 categories - for sure. Spacey (whom I adore to the point of actually being speechless in front of), brings us, perhaps, his finest performance to date in Quoyle (pronounced coil). Kev reveals Quoyle's soul is wounded and yet his heart, even with all the injustices it has faced in its forty-something years that should be bitter and hard, manages to pound sweet, strong and hopeful. It's an unbelievable performance. Not that I'm surprised&#133;This man is ascrumptious treat for the senses not unlike like fresh fried Ipswich clams drizzled in tarter sauce with a side of old fashioned delectable helping of New England style cole slaw! Why's Spacey so great? Is it because he hung with Jack Lemmon in his formative years as an actor? Or because (like myself) he adores the complicated gritty works of Eugene O'Neill? Perhaps, because he makes himself aloof to keep his personality out of his films, thusly making himself completely disappear into the film? Um&#133;yeah. Disagree? Get your own review. K-PAX aside, his work always brilliant, intense, or funny, or light&#133;it's what ever he wants it to be. I'd breed with the man, sure, but I'm also sure I will not be alone in my admiration for his performance here. Sorry, Russell, your also grand and one helluva actor, but your butt has been elegantly drop kicked by Cadet Fowler for the mad mad race for Oscar&#133;Judi Dench is, as always, an inspiration on film. Julianne Moore (Wavey) worked her plane Jane gorgeous self into a yarn of great depth and feeling. We wanted to make her tea and give her a hug by the end of the film.Cate I'm in every movie on the marquee this winter Blanchett is a chameleon- somebody check her body temperature and dining habits! As Quale's rude, nasty, sluty bimbette squared love interest, Petal, she makes you loath her within the first forty-eight frames.Petal and Quoyle's offspring, little Bunny, was played by triplets Alyssa, Kaitlyn, and Lauren Gainer.

You can picture the little dolls finished with their scenes sneaking off to be kids again please pass the play dough, please, I'm done with my scene mum.Pete Kobayashi Postlewaite plays Quoyle's nemesis at the paper with tons of humor and that smoothness of delivery he's so famous for.

It was such a pleasure to see him- on so many different levels.Director, Lasse Hallstrom (My Life as a Dog, Cider House Rules) is famous for quirky studies on the human condition. Here he's strung his cast together like a Newfoundland fisherman's net and draws them so tightly together so as not a syllable of dialog slips away. In lesser hands The Shipping News could have been a sentimental sugar encrusted bakers dozen of stale over done leaden donuts.There's so many more involved and each deserves accolades for bringing an already warm story to the screen with a remarkable toasty reality that makes you laugh, stir, and wonder&#133; I feel bad for Ron Howard. He finally gets a nod or two and he has to be up against this film. Snack recommendation Plain Donuts, fried octopus tentacle sandwiches and teaHeadline The Shipping News looms over small cinema. Crowds, hearing the buzz, rush to see it opening day! The masses exclaim for once a film is better than its hype.Blunt Aside Have you noticed the names I've listed; Petal Wavey, Bunny? That's just some of Proulx's magic. She chooses her names in such a way as to metaphorically manipulate your mind without your even knowing it. Even Quoyle has significance. After you see the film (which is mandatory) the names will come gloriously into the light. Trust me.

Proulx's writing style, while unique and engaging for athe first hundred pages, quickly becomes cloying and irritating in the last 200.  While here characters were elegantly and ingeniously crafted (Billy Pretty, both in tyhe pages and on the screen by Newfie Gordon Pinsent being the best of the bunch), and here sparse descriptions of the Newfoundland landscape befitting the sparse and bare Western Shore (although there are some mighty fine towns along that same coast), here characterization of Newfoundlanders is very 'look-down-your-nose' - they are all rustic, and seem never to have seen any modern convieniences, and are second kin to the McCoys of the American Ozarks.  When, in the movie, Quoyle confronts the Old Qouyle who has been cursing the house, we can almost hear the banjo from Deliverance; when they actually show Guy raping Agnes (a needless scene - we know he does it, the guy just told us.  It serves no purpose...), I imagines the movies title to be Deliverance II The Newfoundland ConnectionThis is the biggest problem I have; in the book, there is a line Incest is a way of life in Newfoundland.  and in the movie when Quoyle discovers his grandfather was 12 when he died, and Agnes says You don't know Newfoundlanders.  These strike me a the sort of thing Mainlanders have been saying about Newfoundlanders for years.  The book was written, after all, by an American...The movie itself is a good movie.  Kevin Spacey (my favorite actor of all), turns in a good performance, not a great one, though he gets Quoyle just about spot on if you cut away all the parts about how fat Quoyle is and he is 10 times more insecure than Spacey portrays him, but maybe thats a problem of script.  Dame Judi Dench gives a marvelous portrayal of Agnes, and the staff of the Gammy Bird one and all are spot on perfect in their roles.  Dench, Scott Glenn as Jack Buggit, Pete Postlethwaite (one of the best character actors around) as Tert Card, and the Welsh guy as one of the best characters Nutbeem, and the best guy in the movie, maybe because he's from Newfoundland, Gordon Pinsent as Billy Pretty.  Cate Blanchett is also remarkable as Petal.I voted 8 out of 10 - good, not great.  Lord of the Rings will take Best Picture and best Adapted Screenplay and Best Director, but Dench my get Best Actress, and Gordon Pinsent deserves a nod for Best Supporting Actor.

Annie Proulx, on which it's based.  I assure you, the novel is no better.  If you haven't read the book, the film will encourage your suspicion that Literature  (or Lit'rature, as they say in Oxford and places like it)  has degenerated to the point of extinction.  After seeing the film, you will be astonished that this nonsense, in its novel-form, won the National Book Award.  (Or was it the Pulitzer?)  But then you'll recall that the folks at the National Book Award just gave Stephen King some sort of Lifetime Achievement Award, so how can you say that you're surprised?But this is a review of the movie, not the book, so I'd better get to the point, eh?  First of all, we have Kevin Spacey, who has sadly become the guarantor of bad, maudlin movies.  Here, he plays Quoyle  (pronounced Coil), an apparently half-witted man who, thanks to a plot contrivance, gets involved with a slut played by Cate Blanchett.  You won't believe your eyes when you see Blanchett  (whose character's name is  Petal -- can we get more  lit'ry?)  ride Spacey like a mechanical bull.  Only in the movies . . . and in today's prize-winning lit'rature, I guess. Naturally, the doofus gets the slut pregnant -- enter new daughter  Bunny  (I guess we CAN get more lit'ry).  Well, Petal proves to be averse to family life and -- NOT a spoiler, this is very early in the film -- takes a powder, dying in a car wreck with a new boyfriend.  Hilariously, the police tell Quoyle that Petal sold Bunny to an  adoption slave-ring.  Now THIS is Lit'rature, folks!Judi Dench shows up and steals the ashes of Quoyle's father.  I forgot to mention, Quoyle's parents had died at some point during all this, and Dench is the sister of Quoyle's father.  Which makes her, of course, Spacey's aunt.  To quote Don Henley, Are you with me so far?  Dench spirits Quoyle and Bunny away to their ancestral home of Newfoundland for a fresh start. (Proulx'  choice of setting is a typical lit'ry cliche  New - Found - Land. Get it?)  You're probably wondering why Dench stole her brother's ashes. It's so that she can urinate on them after dumping them in an outhouse toilet.  Ah-HA -- there must be some sort of Deep, Dark, Lit'ry Secret behind all this!This is getting wearisome, so let me wrap it up like a Newfoundland cod. Quoyle gets a job as a reporter for the local rag and meets Julianne Moore, a widow of four years whose single status is extremely unlikely in such a small community.  Meanwhile, the Quoyle family lives in a tied-down house on a cliff above the beach that's so drafty one wonders why they're not all dead from pneumonia by the end of the movie.  Spacey learns how to use a boat, and finds decapitated bodies in the sea.  His daughter beats old dolls to death with hammers, and befriends Moore's retarded young son.  A skinny ghost with a pet lurks about the tied-down house, leaving trash on the doorstep in the dead of night.  Everyone eats squid hamburgers.  One character rises from the dead like Lazarus, thereby ending a salty old curse.  Magic realism, hidden tragedies, broken people -- all the usual ingredients that constitute today's crappy literature.The biggest revelation in  *The Shipping News*  is how good Cate Blanchett looks with her pants off.  Other than that, it's just another Miramax film. You've been warned.

We have seen them in Chocolat, What's Eating Gilbert Grape? and in The Cider House Rules. His selection of novels he makes films based on is also brilliant. Here, The Shipping News is another master stroke from him which leaves the viewer quite in awe to the film's sentiments and atmosphere.I haven't read the novel. And it's quite unlikely I'll find it in my local bookstores and I hate e-books. So I can never judge the film's quality of adaptation. All I can say is that the film offers us a wonderful story of a rather ordinary man named Quoyal who's brilliantly portrayed by Kevin Spacey. The character of Quoyal is still fascinating, extra-ordinarily ordinary. The best chemistry of Quoyal is not with his later love-interest Wavey, but with his aunt Agnis. This is a major touch of brilliance in the story. The story also tells us about Newfoundland and its people... and leaves us indeed fascinated by those facts. But in the end, emotions are same everywhere, be it Newfoundland or Indonesia, so the story is ultimately of grief, sense of loss, rediscovering one's self and love.Julianne Moore is rather stiff in this film. I don't know whether it's for her role or she acted badly. Judi Dench is a pleasure to watch again. Cate Blanchett's extended cameo is awesome too. But actors don't carry the film. The major credit for the film goes to the director. There's a major flaw (perhaps) in the story in the end concerning the character Jack but Hallstrom pulls it off nicely so that the audience cannot react to it and accepts it temporarily. Hats off to you, Mr Hallström.

Inexplicably, he falls for a woman who turns out to be a complete tramp--and this is being very kindly towards the woman to refer to her this way! The woman is simply no good and cheats on Quoyle--right in front of him. But, he's so dependent and thinks so little of herself that he accepts this.

Together, they both leave the States and move back to the family homestead in VERY rural Newfoundland. What's next? See the film.There is a lot more to the film than this but frankly describing the plot is silly, as it's more a slice of life film where the focus is much more on the characters and acting.

He and his daughter follow her on her journey to their ancestral home in Newfoundland where he attempts to better his life and the life of his daughter, and battle with the demons in both his own past and that of his ancestors.This is a small film with a rich bevy of supporting characters.  If it weren't for these characters the movie would not be nearly as interesting.  The excellent script also compliments the cast in a way that allows the film to transcend other small quirky town films.  And, as always Kevin Spacey owns his role in such a way that you cannot imagine another actor playing the part - especially important in this film because he is featured in most of the film's scenes.It took a long time for me to finally see this film because while I am a Kevin Spacey fan, the film seemed to be yet another treatment of the fish out of small town water piece.

Annie Proulx.It stars Kevin Spacey as the protagonist Quoyle, Judi Dench as Agnis Hamm and Julianne Moore as Wavey Prowse. Pete Postlethwaite,Scott Glenn,Rhys Ifans,Cate Blanchett,Jason Behr and Gordon Pinsent co-star to play key supporting roles.It is directed by Lasse Hallström.Quoyle is a struggling, emotionally drained newspaper reporter suffering through a wretched marriage with the abusive Petal, a promiscuous wild woman who tries to sell their daughter, Bunny, into adoption before she's killed in a car wreck. Retrieving his daughter, Quoyle sets out for Newfoundland, his ancestral home, with his long-lost Aunt Agnis. Although he initially finds life on the island to be as forbidding and severe as Agnis herself, Quoyle gets work as a shipping columnist for the local newspaper The Gammy Bird, owned by eccentric fisherman Jack Buggit. Quoyle's work soon finds an appreciative audience and he begins to rebuild his life, dating local single mother Wavey, learning some sea craft, discovering his family's dark history, and finally earning some self-respect. Agnis, in the meantime, starts her own successful business and faces a traumatic incident from her childhood involving Quoyle's late father.Though solidly made and acted,the movie is rather heavy-handed and dull, especially given the nature of its protagonist brilliantly shows Quoyle's transformation from a passive clod to a curious journalist.Kevin Spacey and Julianne Moore astound in touching, well- told tale of rebirth and redemption.On the other hand,it maybe considered modest but true feeling for the ways in which people are formed by the ravages of their natural surroundings can definitely touch the viewer and should be considered an excellent film despite its obvious flaw of awkwardness.

It's a rather good yarn this, an outlandishly plotted but nonetheless credible romance set in a modern Newfoundland community. It's well-acted and Lasse Hallström moves the story along briskly. So where's the problem?I think it's to do with Hallström's determination not to fall into the clutches of piratical-style yarn-spinning. Me hearties. There are an awful lot of little stories just waiting in line to reveal themselves. In the context of a superstitious coastal community one is always a bit circumspect about whether tales are about to be debunked as myth or simply manufactured, especially as the central prepubescent is painted as borderline clairvoyant. Consequently, none of the plot threads are given the chance to really take hold and stir the emotions. For a sincere film it's emotionally over-restrained.Neither does it help that Kevin Spacey slightly misjudges his homecoming naïf - he goes from being spectacularly stupid, to sagaciously adult in far too short a space of time. All the others have the developmental mettle of their roles better managed. I enjoyed the film but I get the impression that Proulx's novel isn't meant to be quite as breezy. 6.5/10 "},{"Title":"An article of faith","Date":"16 April 2006","Score":"2 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama","Review":" Lasse Halstrom's (2001) film with screenplay by Robert Nelson Jacobs is based on the novel by Annie Proulx.Set in Newfoundland sometime in the sixties or seventies, it tells the tale of a slow and steady young man named Quoyle (Kevin Spacey) who falls unwittingly into a marriage doomed to fail. From the wreck and ruin of it, he salvages his daughter Bunny (played at different stages by Alyssa, Kaitlyn and Lauren Gainer) and is persuaded by his beleaguered Aunt Agnis (Judi Dench) to go back to the scene of the crime.The scene of crime is his old ancestral home in Newfoundland. Arrived there, he chances on a job as newspaper reporter, being hired by the owner Jack Buggit (Scott Glenn), and finds himself suddenly immersed among a group of people who more or less begin the colossal task of straightening him out a little. Not that they're doing it on purpose. For them, it's just second nature.Tert Card (Pete Postlethwaite) is first to start in on the confused but resilient Coyle - a man whose life 'happens' to him, rather than being the result of any confident effort on his own part to steer his life in a given direction. As the new cub-reporter he is assigned the worst and most uninteresting job on the paper - covering car wrecks and 'The Shipping News'.But being the kind of man he is, good things come to him like timid, shy creatures which usually stay well out in the wilderness. He strikes up an acquaintance with a single mother, Wavey Prowse (Julianne Moore) but has even more shocks and unexpected skeletons to discover in his Aunt's cupboard.As the film unfolds, we see a slow and remarkable transformation in the apparently slow and uncomprehending Quoyle. A chance visit by a yacht reputedly owned by Adolf Hitler transforms his career from cub reporter to feature writer. His developing relationship with Wavey creates a rich environment for his wounds to heal and gives him the strength to support his Aunt as she finally confronts her own demons.We finally learn why she had to come back, and we see Quoyle's journey almost complete as we leave them.This is a great film with surprises and delights around every corner.

He does it extremely well and carries this star-studded film. In pace and style it reminds me of Lone Star, the story and characters are gradually revealed in layers as the story moves along. We don't know everything we need to know until the very end, but the viewer is never cheated. The gradual revealing of details is consistent with each character. Of interest to me, his young daughter was played, one at a time, by identical triplets.some SPOILERS - Spacey had a difficult time as a child, his father was not a good man, almost drowned him to teach him how to swim. In a neat bit of editing we see the young boy, underwater, gradually morph into the adult Spacey.  At one point we see him sitting in a newspaper plant, watching the printed pages go by, and he tells his boss, This is the best job I've ever had. Speaks volumes to his ambition, which is about as low as one can get. His daughter resulted from a one-night seduction, and the mother (Cate Blanchett) went so far as to try and sell the daughter to an adoption agency for $6thousand, right before she and a boyfriend crashed and drowned.more SPOILERS - Spacey's parents kill themselves, his aunt (Judy Dench)shows up for the ashes (she steals them, later throws into the outhouse and craps on them, contempt she had for brother, who we later find out had raped her when she was 12). So the three (him, aunt, daughter) of them travel to the old house on a rocky point, anchored with cables, which had not been occupied in 44 years, and in bad need of repair. Legend has it their ancestors were such crooks they were banished from the former homesite, and dragged this house across the ice to the craggy point.more SPOILERS - At the new location Spacey gets a job at the local newspaper, wanting to be an inker, but was given the job that terrified him, writing the weekly Shipping News and covering automobile accidents. After a rocky start, eventually becomes quite good at it. He meets a local widow (Julianne Moore), they become friends, and eventually more than that. Her husband had not died, he had run off with a teenager, leaving her behind and pregnant, and she gave birth to a handicapped boy. Spacey's daughter becomes the only child who ever made friends with him.  Cute line (daughter), Can't you see I'm reading to him?  He doesn't know I can't read.Re-reading my synopsis, the story sounds a bit cheesy. But it isn't, it is unfolded and filmed very well, and the traces of mysticism thrown in are part of the good effect. It is the kind of film you can watch on successive days and get even more out of it the second time.I saw it on DVD. While the quality overall is fine, there quite a few artifacts and blemishes from a less than satisfactory transfer from film to video. Enough that it distracted me at times.

All comments made herein are with reference to the movie.I could have seen Shipping News during Christmas holidays in Toronto in 2001, but somehow managed to miss it. I don't believe this movie ever came to town. It became a rather exciting event when the good wife spotted a HK$20 DVD over the weekend at HMV (and therefore definitely NOT a pirated version). SN, I found, is a movie that I can watch with considerable detachment. Bizarre might have been too strong a word, but slightly out-of-the-ordinary treatment of some not-so-uncommon situations is just enough to stay audiences from empathising too closely and yet keep them intrigued. Example? A 12-year old girl raped by her older brother comes back after 50/60 years to steal his cremated remains to have the satisfaction of being able to urinate on them.The characters in this movie remind me of Dicken's trademark caricatures, characters purposefully steered away from being multi-dimensional so as to draw out their unique eccentricities. We can almost see Quoyle as a Pip of sorts wading through his own array of versions, benevolent or otherwise, of Miss Havisham, Mr. Jaggers, Mr. Wemmick, Uncle Pumblechook etc. etc.Also seen as one of the characters is the old family house, perched on a rocky precipice on the rugged coasts of Newfoundland. Houses playing an important part in a movie that come immediately to mind are the one constructed in Life as a House (2001) and the quaint little flat in the Korean gem Siworae (or Il Mare, 2000). Neither however features as prominently as the one in NS, heavy symbolism of the bloody history of the Quoyles. While we are on the Quoyle pirates, I note with particular interest that the manoeuvre of moving a lighthouse from one cliff to another to trick ships into smashing against the rocks has been used before, in a very watchable Japanese samurai/mystery Goyokin (Official Gold, 1969).Hauntingly beautiful Newfoundland, beautifully shot, is one main attraction of SN. As one with the fortunate experience of walking outdoors (albeit very briefly) at forty degrees below (at which point Fahrenheit and Centigrade happen to converge) in a mining town, I found the scene of the biting snow enjoyable but not particularly stunning. The beauty of the ocean is also not unknown. However, putting these elements together does work wonders for SN.Finally, journeying with Quoyle along his various nightmares does have great rewards, not only in the magnificent acting of Spacey himself, but also the rest of the excellent cast Moore, Blanchett, Dench, Postelthwaite, Glenn, Ifans&#133;.and, last but not least, the triplet Gainer sisters.

Quoyle is - frankly - a bit of a loser. By accident he meets the woman of his dreams one night (Petal, played by Cate Blanchett) and they end up almost immediately married and with a child, except that Petal doesn't take Quoyle, the marriage, motherhood or anything else very seriously. Quoyle is basically an emotionally abused husband, albeit a pretty good dad. Petal is tragically killed and his father dies and he meets his father's sister (Agnis Hamm, played by Judy Dench) who convinces him that he should move to his ancestral home in Newfoundland, where he starts all over.That's the story. The basic problem - to me - is that it just doesn't seem to go anywhere. Spacey and Dench put on good performances, but I just didn't find it a particularly interesting movie. And there were a number of things that bugged me.First, the portrayal of Newfoundlanders was offensive. Based on this you'd think everybody in Newfoundland was an incestuous drunkard. Second, How did Quoyle move so easily from New York to Newfoundland? It's true that you wouldn't know it from this movie where the only shot of a flag you see is of an American flag, but Newfoundland is a part of CANADA. You don't just one day up and move from New York to Newfoundland. There are immigration requirements to be met, paperwork to be done, etc., etc., yet Quoyle just seems to up and move. And without any of the legal requirements being met, how does this guy get a job in Canada? Curious. And third - my pet peeve - the wake at the end of the movie is totally ridiculous. I served as a clergyman in Newfoundland for three years in the mid 1990's. What happened at that wake (I won't give it away) might have happened 50 years ago, but not today. They've discovered the fine art of embalming in Newfoundland. The body would be fished from the ocean (most likely by the RCMP), probably autopsied, embalmed at a funeral home and in a small town most likely waked in a church, not somebody's home.There are some good points here. Spacey and Dench were really quite good in their roles, and there is some excellent photography of the Newfoundland coastline. The story itself, though, just doesn't work.

It is a story with great exaggeration, which contains a writer who must use great exaggeration in his stories. Much of the exposition explains why, and draws the reader into the space between the cartoon that is the book and the cartoon that is the newscolumn without us noticing that we are goofing on ourselves.The template for the mechanism is the first such superreal novel `Cannery Row.' This is copied even down to the destructive party. Except here, the humor was from a different locale, superficially a minor transposition. But there was even self-reference in that treatment of the locale studied treatment on the immoveability of place including deep use of local language, the business of the restrained house, and the extended metaphor of the oil tankersSo when I heard of the cast, I had great hopes. Cate and Julianne are the two living actresses capable of projecting just this kind of self-reference.But what a mess Hallstrom has made! This is the `Harry Potter' school of filmmaking where a book is reduced to the episodes therein and they are marched before us without any sense of the world from which they project. A collection of thin banalities and cute platitudes are substituted, as with his last film.In fact, not a shred of originality or art is allowed to creep in, from the `Prince of Tides' first shot to the obligatory and ordinary helicopter ending. All of the self-reference is lost, except the thin device of Spacey giving some headlines to his life. Nearly all the local peculiarities have been ironed out, even the accents. We are left with a few rugged crags instead. As an example, consider the moving house. I have recently seen three other films with moving buildings, the remarkable `Oscar and Lucinda' (where Cate was allowed to do her rare stuff), `The Widow of St Pierre,' which wasn't novel but lovely, and the underrated `The Claim.' In each case, the filmmaker stretched for visual effect. Lasse is tired, derivative, unartful.This man really is a menace. His license to make films should be revoked.

At first, I thought it would be one of those Hollywood adaptations loaded with dramatic clichés but as the story moves on and the characters build up, it makes a better turn. The film appears to centre around Quoyle and his struggle to find a new life after the death of his promiscuous vampish wife (whose last act was selling their daughter to a black market adoption agency,unbeknownst to Quoyle). However, the supporting characters (even though they have limited screen time) are equally important because they all have a dark secret and that's what 'The Shipping News' is about, how sharing a secret can set someone free from burden.The film beautifully captures Newfoundland, right from the somewhat barren yet stunning landscape to the local culture. The cinematography, art direction and score contribute well to the atmosphere. Newfoundland itself is presented as a character.Even though I found the pacing to be a little uneven, the refreshing subtle humour balances well with the quiet intense scenes. Spacey's Quoyle appears to be a tad monotonous in the first half. There was something lacking in Spacey's performance during this portion a but the actor does manage to do much more with the role in the second half. Julianne Moore, Judi Dench, Pete Postlethwaite and Cate Blanchett are superb. Even though Blanchett's character is poorly developed, the actress rises above it.

This is not microwavable fare and it is not for everyone. For those who love a well-crafted, slowly roasted work of art, though, The Shipping News proves that a watched pot WILL eventually boil.SPOILERS AHEADLasse Hallstrom pulls together at least three distinct stories into one quite cohesive whole and manages to keep a haunted, almost spiritual Newfoundland feel to the picture. Kevin Spacey carries the biggest load, as 40-something loser Guy Quoyle. Virtually friendless and seemingly devoid of personality, self-confidence or ambition, he stumbles through life in a trance until a chance encounter connects him with the first love of his life.Quoyle, though, finds evil, death and deceit wherever he turns-past, present or future. An attractive, but psychotic woman named Petal jumps into his car and his life, has his baby and then shamelessly tramples on her door mat of a husband. Finally, she sells their daughter, Bunny (`Yes, that's her real name,' Quoyle tells the police over the phone, the same with Petal.) to a black market adoption ring, before dying in a car wreck. This is the same week in which Quoyle gets a phone message at work from his father, who informs him that he and Quoyle's mother are committing suicide, dumping a final load of self-pity and guilt on him in the process.Just as the stunned widower/father is left to pick up the pieces with his 6-year-old daughter (triplets Alyssa, Kaitlyn and Lauren Gainer), his long lost Aunt Agnis Hamm (Judi Dench) shows up to see (actually to steal) the ashes of her half-brother (Quoyle's dad). She convinces Quoyle and Bunny to come with her to Newfoundland, where the Quoyle clan originated. Having few other options, he goes and finds that he no longer has to spell out the name `Quoyle.'Quoyle, a newspaper inksetter by trade, winds up landing a reporter's job on the tiny local newspaper, run by no-nonsense journalist/fisherman Jack Buggitt (Scott Glenn). He gradually finds a surprising taste of success, writing a `Shipping News' column and begins pursuing a romance with redhaired widow Wavey  Prowse (Julianne Moore), while Bunny becomes the first friend her mildly retarded son has ever had.Much of the above is in the plot summary. A man finding himself by writing for a newspaper (my being a journalist) was what led me to keep an eye out for this film to hit video. Hallstrom packs so much more into 111 minutes, though. The summary gives no hint of the supernatural thread running throughout the movie, nor of the constant, layer by layer exposing of secrets. Nothing is as it seems in this tiny Newfoundland village, and evil seems to lurk around every corner. Hallstrom could actually have changed a few ingredients and come away with a quite good horror movie or a good straight romance film. As it is, he manages to stir the broth and keep the disparate themes from disturbing each other.Many Newfoundlanders, Aunt Agnis tells Quole are `sensitive.' That is, they have a sixth sense or an ability to know things others do not know. Little Bunny quickly proves to be one of these. As Guy Quoyle begins gaining confidence, he is forced to face many haunting shadows from his own past, as well as his family's and his new girl friend's. Without giving every secret away here, the film combines a few goose bumps with some lumps in the throat and even a few chuckles, thanks to the Robert Nelson Jacobs adaptation of the E. Annie Proulx novel.The cast is fine, from the understated performance of Stacey, to the equally riveting work of Dench, Moore, Blanchett, Scott and others. The scenery is breathtaking and the sets are convincing. Oliver Stapleton's cinematography is superb. So is the original music of Christopher Young, which lifts the film more than most soundtracks. The pagan, Celtic drum and flute music, beating like the Newfoundland blood in Quoyle's veins, drives the film and helps usher in the many subtleties of mood desired by Hallstrom.No doubt, some impatient modern film viewers will call this film slow or boring. Hallstrom roasts it slowly in its black cauldron, at his own speed. The product may take a while to reach a boil, but it will be a treat the intelligent film connoisseur will find well worth the wait.

Kevin Spacey has helped to portray just how easy it is for mainlanders to become welcomed and loved by the population of Newfoundland. The people here, for the most part, have a very friendly and courteous way of welcoming others into their homes.The film itself was very enjoyable, both funny and sad at times. It also portrays how most of life's hardships can be overcome with time and patience. I do not want to give away any of the exciting details of this movie, so that's it for me -- if you really want to know just how the movie goes -- Go Watch It!!!!

The Shipping News is a nice little movie, nothing special, but it has the right combination of drama, scenery and humour that I enjoyed watching it very much.  Kevin Spacey plays Quoyle, an inksetter at the Poughkeepsie News going nowhere in a dead end job and a marriage to a flagrantly cheating woman (Cate Blanchett).  Circumstances take him and his aunt (Judi Dench) to Newfoundland, where a new life begins.  Julianne Moore does a fine job as Wavey Prowse whose life intersects with Quoyle's.For those like me who have read the book, there are a few omissions, such as the younger daughter and no mention of Quoyle's friend Partridge, yet Lasse Halstrom strikes a balance between faithfulness to the story and the sweep of scenery and atmosphere.  Much like last year's Chocolat, it is a gentle film that one can spend 2 hours enjoying.  I'm not sure that Spacey is the right actor to portray Quoyle, yet he does an excellent job going against type, so perhaps that's what acting is all about.  So if you want to see a good enjoyable and involving movie, see The Shipping News, and leave self indulgent crap like the Royal Tennenbaums to those who like being bored senseless for 2 hours.

Hallstrom has done a good job considering Proulx' experimental and entangled style. After all, if a rope full of knots can conjure up a storm of shipwrecks, then a Swedish director might just be able to illuminate the bonds between a great American writer and an exotic land. Kevin Spacey does well, and so does Julianne Moore. But before you become too pleased, keep in mind that only Robert Joy (the officer at the moose accident scene) and Gordon Pinsent (Billy Pretty) speak with true Newfoundland accents. In an otherwise acceptable project, with the exception of the scenery, that's probably as close to the book as a film can ever get. Live with it, and celebrate.

The treatment that it gets on screen, is a different story. Lasse Hallstrom's version of The Shipping News leaves one very cold, by the way the director has dealt with the material and actors.One wonders what Ms. Proulx thought about the finished product and of the job of the screenwriter's adaptation of this difficult novel? All the elements of the novel are displayed, yet, I found it without 'soul', or maybe a center, or a clear direction of what the author was telling us. No doubt, this is a very difficult work to translate in cinema terms. It's a sure bet that Robert Nelson Jacob had his very good intentions in giving us the essence of the book. Sometimes he succeeds, and sometimes he fails.The main character, Quoyle, is a man whose life has passed him by and has not met someone to share his lonely existence. His life with Petal is just a mess. He certainly picked a winner who obviously, couldn't care less about him. She's a self-centered person. She's incapable of giving anything in return to her husband and so she goes having fun with any man that might appear in the horizon. Kevin Spacey fares better in this film than in his most recent work. He definitely underplays the character to the point of exasperation, as we would like to see him stop being the nincompoop he portrays and become the man one wants him to be.On the other hand, Julianne Moore's Wavey Prowse is a mousy woman who is in the same league as Quoyle. She's been left with a son in such a desolate spot of the world that when Quoyle appears in her life, she's hesitant to take what's coming her way. It's very difficult, at times, to understand her, as she has adopted a brogue that's as thick as some of the fog in the area.In translating the novel to the screen, the role of the aunt, Agnis Hamm has been expanded, no doubt to let Dame Judi Dench do her turn, as the woman who has been the object of a horrible deed in her past, at the hand of a loved one. It's a treat to see this actress dispose of the ashes of the brother in such an unflattering, matter-of-fact way.The film could have been helped if it had been trimmed a bit. The locations in Newfoundland are very impressive indeed with the ruggedness of the landscape and the climate they have to put up with.

Innovative performance by Spacey who survives the bland subplots by being genuine. Judi Dench plays the aunt who might have been more interesting had she not gotten caught up in useless melodrama regarding the past. She eventually resorts to pouring ashes down a toilet. Julianne Moore plays a withdrawing kindergarten teacher who predictably must get involved with Spacey then open up with a long speech about her past that we've long lost interest in.

I was interested to see Kevin Spacey was starring as I have enjoyed a few of his productions at the Old Vic in London. It was on late and I had been watching a programme on TV abut Judy Dench. I found the film engaged my attention from the start. I had no idea how the story would develop. By the time the bleak landscape of Newfoundland was revealed I was completely engaged in the film. With its undertones of child abuse, incest and neglect, this film was disturbing in some ways, but the portrayal of the village newspaper, the remote community life, the bleak landscape and the stormy coast, gave it a powerful impact, which stayed with me long after it was finished. There were top notch performances by a strong cast, not least, the child who played Bunny. In fact a lot of it deals with how children cope with abuse and neglect and can come to terms with it, even when they are adults. The last words in the film, spoken by Kevin Spacey, A broken man can heal, perhaps sum up the film's ultimate message of the triumph of the human spirit against all odds.

Though Quoyle has had little success thus far in life, his shipping news column in the newspaper The Gammy Bird finds an audience, and his experiences in the town change his life. Then he meets the widow Wavey. Roger Ebert wrote The film suffers from a severe case of obviously being a film. There is never the sense that Quoyle Point, or anyplace remotely like it, could exist outside this movie. Maybe this is Canadian magic realism. At this year's Toronto Film Festival, I saw Rare Birds, also shot in Newfoundland, starring William Hurt as a restaurant owner and Molly Parker in the Julianne Moore role.

Slow-moving with on the face of it nothing much happening and slowly at that, is intense slice-of-life piece with just a touch of supernatural mystery at the edges to spice things up.Kevin Spacey is the native Newfoundlander whose moved away from his family roots winding up in a dead-end job as a print-setter, but still haunted and indeed stunted by his difficult relationship with his demanding father, his journey to his troubled adulthood crystallised in an effective montage showing him growing up before our eyes even as he struggles in a sink-or-swim situation his dad has throw him into.Desperate for love and a meaning to his life, he falls hard for Cate Blanchett's wild floozy of a character, the improbably-named Petal who gives him a daughter but quickly tires of both their doe-eyed worship of her until her live-fast, die-young credo reaches its natural abrupt ending. At his lowest ebb in the aftermath of Petal's demise, he's visited by his strange, taciturn, native Newfoundland aunt Judi Dench and with her encouragement decides to return to the run-down family home with her and his wilful daughter to try to rebuild his shattered life. There he takes a job on the local paper and begins a cautious romance with Julianne Moore's similarly circumstanced character.Hellstrum superbly captures the rugged beauty of Newfoundland with his exteriors and the strictures of small-town living with his interiors. It helps that his two leads, Spacey and Moore can seemingly internalise at will and if occasionally they overdo it, at least there are the likes of stolid old Judi Dench with her own dark secret, Pete Postlethwaite stand-in editor at the paper and Scott Gkenn as his domineering editor all working effectively in the background to rein them in.Some of the more fanciful stuff in the narrative betrays a too strict adherence I would imagine to the source novel as I thought a little more concentration on the lives of the central characters at the expense of the local mythology and legends wouldn't have gone amiss plus I promise you will find it tricky, to say the least, to identify with these somewhat strange townsfolk. Set anchor with it though as ultimately this well acted and directed film does deliver its own subtle rewards in the end.

Along with that is the run-of-mill romance with Julianne Moore's small town widow. Their development is rather unbelievable and uninteresting as well as Spacey's acting with his character's daughter at times OK, and at other times painful.

And this one is certainly deserving.Set amongst 'back-woods folk' which can sometimes work and sometimes not, here we meet an abused character - played by Spacey - being more-or-less rescued by an older relative (Judi Dench). They and his young daughter decamp to a derelict old family clapboard house near the coast of Newfoundland.Here, he gets a job on the local paper, and begins writing the eponymous 'Shipping News'.There's been quite a lot of movies like this; 'Man Without A face' is very similar. Strip-out the slaughter and so is 'Fargo'. They're very much an acquired taste, I think, and this is borne-out by the rather love/hate responses of the commentators here.Isolation still enables people to be themselves. The facade of cosmopolitan mainstream hasn't yet endued everyone with politically-correct plastic. Characters are quirky and awkward.This production does tend to drag a little for me too. It becomes needlessly dark in its take on human nature. But there's a lot going for it as well. Not the least of which is the top-dollar acting from Spacey, Dench et al, and the excellent brooding photography of these harsh coastal landscapes. I haven't been to Newfoundland but have spent time in Scotland, Norway and Alaska, and they seem very similar in many ways.It's not an actioner. And it's certainly not a barrel of laughs, though there's an abiding thread of humour stitched into the fabric of pain. It's certainly not a classic either. But whatever criticisms may be rightly levied at its production, the sound score, photography, and largely peerless acting redeem it at least to the level of worthy.Give it a whizz.

The reason is obvious one watches it as one reads an intriguing novel and the intensity it evokes is best experienced in a peaceful and solitary environment. Solitude we are all alone and the misfortunes of life contribute all the more to reinforcing a deep feeling of existential emptiness. The main characters in The Shipping News are loners. Wounded souls some who at best have apparently come to terms with their plight while others are still searching for a sense of meaning. Desolate people in a desolate landscape. Surrounded by the sea, all the inhabitants of this barren piece of earth seem to be excluded from the warmth they seek and that neither nature nor others have to offer. The sparkle of hope comes mainly from Quoyle and Wavey two people who have not fully abandoned their quest for relative happiness. This movie excels in the creation of atmosphere and the rendering of the original script on the screen must surely have been an extremely difficult task. The acting is exquisite with a special mention for the outstanding performances by both Spacey and Moore.Kevin Spacey, in particular, has that rare gift of really being the character he portrays without becoming a stereotype.

I really liked the storyline. (See other comments for a fuller plot outline.) However, I found this to be quite a strange film in the respect that it was simultaneously too long and too short. Let me explain...The film seemed to be trying to do too many things with too many characters. There were several 'main' characters (Spacey, Moore, Dench, the daughter Bunny, Blanchett to a degree) with their own histories and developments. There were also many peripheral characters, some also with their own stories.I felt that the film had too much going on and seemed to lose its focus, so instead of being drawn into all the characters' stories we are drawn into none. In that respect I felt the film should have been longer so that the plot lines could be fleshed out more.For example, towards the end of the film there are several plot revelations relating the main characters. However, instead of thinking, Oh right! THAT's why that character was behaving that way! I just thought, Oh, OK then. If you say so. The revelations seemed to come out of nowhere. I didn't feel I was led to believe there WAS anything to reveal (especially in Julianne Moore's case), or at least the hints were very subtle and not enough to suck me into the characters' stories.**MAJOR SPOILERS**I mean, was there ANYTHING in the film to hint at the fact that there was anything untoward about Julianne Moore's marriage? Did we really feel that Judi Dench had some dark, secret from the past? OK, there were hints, but not enough to draw you into her character or make you think anything major occurred. The cousin (?) just came out of nowhere (plotwise) and spilt all the beans. Also, were we led to believe that the Quoyles may have had a sinister past, before we suddenly discover their true origins? All I remember is that they were known as sea-folk.**END SPOILERS**Not that I'm condoning the sledgehammer approach, but I did feel that main characters' surfaces were barely scratched before their exteriors were suddenly ripped off, with Spacey a possible exception.So, despite the fact that I feel that the film should have been longer, my detachment from the main characters made the film seem slightly slow - hence it 'felt' a bit overlong.All in all, this seems to smack of a film trying to be faithful to a novel (which I have not read) by cramming in as many of its characters and events as possible, while overlooking the main feel, emotions and intrigue of the story and its protagonists.Having said that, the story itself, as it resolves itself in the end, along with strong performances still make this an above average movie.

However, when Blanchett is killed in a motor accident, heartbroken Spacey leaves with his daughter and aunt (Judi Dench) and goes to Newfoundland, where the Quoyle family originated, living in their family's old dilapidated house. Once there, he learns that the Quoyle name is renowned and, almost just with said name, manages to get a job as a reporter with the local newspaper. Getting to know the people there, Quoyle soon starts to learn things about his family that he wished he didn't know.One of the biggest attributes of the film is the acting. With a stellar cast, pretty much everyone in the film give fine performances. However, it is the predictably brilliant Cate Blanchett that impresses most as she pulls off a role that no-one could ever imagine her in, so different to what she usually does. It is only a shame that she appears for such a short amount of time.The performances are also backed up with a solid script that knows when to be serious and when to be humorous, handling Quoyle's discovery of his Newfoundland roots very deftly, providing much of the films comic moments. But perhaps the greatest praise would be that it does not make the child characters seem mature beyond their age &#150; something that irritates me immensely.However, where The Shipping News does fall down on is the lack of originality of the story. Whilst a very honest story about a man trying to deal with his past (with the death of his wife and the dark secrets of his family paralleling each other), it is also a theme that has been done to death in similar and, arguably, better films, such as Delores Claiborne. And though visually stunning and ripe with metaphors, the film seems uncertain as to how or what point to make. And ultimately, after the 100 minutes, you're left positively confused as to what has happened to merit Quoyle's transformation.The Shipping News is a solid film, with a quality script and boasting an impressive cast that also includes Pete Postlethwaite and Julianne Moore, which unfortunately fails to deliver a strong enough story. However, if nothing else, it is a showcase of very impressive performances from some of the best acting talent around today and the landscapes are enough to make you fall in love with Newfoundland.

It is a story about how a man named Guy Quoyle (Kevin Spacey) confronts his fears, faces his past, and recovers to find happiness in a new land.  The film traces Quoyle's journey toward self-discovery when he returns to his family home in Newfoundland.The story begins with a narration by Quoyle as a boy when his father throws him into the water off of a boat dock.  That childhood episode is a sink-or-swim education provided by his father that left Quoyle breathless, and afraid.  Through the narration we learn that Quoyle is a man who has never succeeded at anything, and his father is always reminding him of his failures.  He struggles through every task he is given and is lost in day-to-day life.As a man with low self-esteem Quoyle is lonely and desperate for attention. One day he meets Petal Bear (Cate Blanchett) and he thinks he is love. Quoyle believes he has found a wife, someone he can love and spend the rest of his life with.  Petal on the other hand just wants to be a kept woman, and sees Quoyle as one of the many men in her chain.  Together they have a daughter Bunny (Alyssa, Kaitlyn, and Lauren Gainer), who makes Quoyle happy and Petal miserable.  Petal eventually starts cheating on Quoyle, even to the point where she brings her one-night stands back to the house.  In a short time frame Quoyle looses his parents who commit suicide and Petal is killed in a car accident while attempting to run off with her boyfriend.Quoyle's Aunt Agnis (Judi Dench) comes to pay her respects and collect her brother's ashes, because she wants to take them back to Newfoundland, the family's home.  Aunt Agnis convinces Quoyle to take Bunny and move to Newfoundland with her.   In Newfoundland Quoyle gets a new job at the local newspaper where he finds success writing a Shipping News Column that builds his self-esteem.  He then pursues a romance with a widow Wavey (Julianne Moore), which brings him happiness.The background selected by director Lasse Hallstrom is appropriate for the setting, cold, dreary and unfeeling.  Lasse Hallstrom also directed `The Cider House Rules', which deals with some of the same issues (incest, finding ones place, moving, recovery, etc.).  I feel that Hallstrom did a better job developing the characters in `The Cider House Rules', than he did in `The Shipping News'.    In `The Shipping News', I felt that Hallstrom sped through the opening part of the film to quickly, apparently to get to the primary action in Newfoundland.I highly recommend `The Shipping News' to anyone who likes a good movie drama with lots of plot lines and spectacular scenery.

I think each of them did as good as they could with the lines they got. My feeling was that there could have been so much more to the fleshing out of the characters, but as it was the movie got a bit too long. However, the young child actress was truly wonderful in her role - I was amazed with her depth, and expect some really great stuff from her in the future.One thing I must comment on - I did not feel that the movie did any real justice to Newfoundland (not unlike other movies set in other exotic locales)...it was portrayed as very one-dimensional, and there is a lot more to the province (and the rest of the Atlantic Canadian provinces) than fishing, car accidents, and seal flipper pie. (I am from central Canada, so I am not speaking with any inherent bias, just trying to give a more objective view of the place.) And the weather! The average temp in May is 10 Celsius, or high 50's/low 60's in Fahrenheit. We're not talking arctic weather here, as appeared to be portrayed in the film. And as for another's comments about why the Irish accent (Julianne Moore) - anyone who knows anything about the Maritime provinces knows that it is a hotbed of Celtic culture, as most of the residents trace their heritage to Scotland and Ireland. So yes, the Irish accent was very appropriate.In summary, it was a good movie to rent when you want to enjoy a movie with some depth as you cozy into a warm quilt with a mug of hot chocolate.

Great story, and wonderful dialogues, some gives you a smile and some really really shock you, great mixture. Lasse Halström created a very cold and unconfortalbe atmosphere. Sometimes the movie strechts a bit too long, but it never is really boring because of the great great acting by Kevin Spacey and his supporting actosr, but Spacey really carries this movie, with his slef irony, his invisible coolness, and his power of acting. He gets great support by the wonderful Judi Dench who gives one of her very best performances, as well as Cate Blanchett who is very different then usual, I love that, she has so many faces and she just proved it again. Sadly Julianne Moore is a bit in the background, actually I expected more of her and her character, it was a bit too undeveleoped, you coul dhave done much more out of it. I loved the cinematography, very gray and like I already mentioned cold but it has some unforgetable scenes and images. The score is very beuaitufl too, totally fits to the area the movie takes place. It has some dramatic scene but also some hilarious ( on some black comedical way hilarious ).It always gives you a smile. 9/10 "},{"Title":"Magnificent Photography, Aimless story","Date":"2 February 2003","Score":"","Genre":"Drama","Review":"  This movie is worth being seen by the great stars in it and its beautiful photography.

Kevin Spacey (R.G. Quoyle) plays the role of a simple man who is a talented newspaper reporter but is very lonely and unhappy until he meets Cate Blanchett (Petal Bear).  He then suffers from an extremely poor marriage to Blanchett where he has mistaken blissful sex for love.  Blanchett is a very promiscuous person who takes their daughter (Alyssa Gainer as Bunny) and leaves. After constantly sleeping around behind Spacey's back, or sometimes right in front of him, Blanchett leaves and tries to get rid of Gainer but ultimately loses her life in a car accident.  At the same time Spacey loses his wife both his parents pass away as well.  At this point a long lost aunt (Judi Dench as Aunt Agnis) comes to visit Spacey to get his parents ashes. It is at this point that Dench takes Spacey and Gainer and moves them to his parent's home country of Newfoundland to claim his inherited house. The move to Newfoundland leaves hopes of forming a new life and unbeknownst to Spacey he will find out the true roots and history of his family.  Spacey's new life slowly begins when he lands a job as a newspaper reporter and ultimately when he meets his new love interest Julianne Moore (Wavey).The combination of actors in this film was outstanding.  Spacey does an excellent job in his role as a lonely, depressed man who wants nothing more than to be happy and to make his family happy as well.  Blanchett's work in this film is just as wonderful as Spacey's.  She did an excellent job at portraying a woman who obviously wants nothing more than to be promiscuous. Judi Dench's role was wonderful as well.The cinematography was exceptional.  It showed how absolutely beautiful the country of Newfoundland truly is.  It gave you sense of actually being there and in turn makes you want to go there to see it yourself, with the exception of all the snowy cold weather!  The motif of water was very clear throughout this film as well.  It's constantly raining in both the U.S and Newfoundland, Spacey's father pushes him in the water when he's a young boy and almost drowns, Spacey feels like he's drowning in his own water bed, Blanchett dies in the water, Spacey almost drowns in the water in Newfoundland and all of Newfoundland is based upon water.  This motif helped to bring out the lonely feelings throughout the film as well as happy feelings when toward the end Spacey and Moore finally get together.The film K-Pax (directed by Iain Softley also starring Spacey) reminded me of The Shipping News.  In K-Pax, Spacey plays a man who went through a lifetime of trauma and ended up finding himself once he got checked into a psychiatric ward.  He realized that life does go on after traumatic events happen.  Similar to Spacey in The Shipping News.  Both films prove that there could be happiness after heartache.The Shipping News is a film that shows all of life ups and downs and how someone's life can get turned around for the better.  Spacey's loneliness in the beginning leads him to some tragedy but that tragedy then leads him to his new life where he ultimately finds happiness.  If you enjoy watching a film that is dramatic with almost every character having skeletons in their closets along with some comic relief than this would be a good film to rent.

All of us at one time or another sit there at the wheel of the car or on the bus and say is this all there is?  Life is boring.  R.G. Quoyle takes us on an adventure that shows that we merely have to peel back the layers of complacency and -- lo and behold -- there is wonder below the surface.  I was not too keen on the circumstances of how they ended up in Newfoundland (ie the accident), but Spacey, as always, pulls off the movie's launch -- as nobody else can -- and we rub our hands in glee at the adventure that awaits us on The Rock.This movie reminds me a bit of Fargo.  Simplistic desolation (be it Newfoundland or Minnesota) surprises us; we discover that, even in out-of-the-way small towns, the life of so-called simple people can, instead, be a complex tapestry worthy of the Naked City.  Not everything exciting has to take place in New York.I loved the cinematography.  Newfoundland is incredibly beautiful, even in its at-first-glance desolation.  The shots along the wind-swept shores, especially near the end, convey the sense of human frailty that Kevin Spacey himself makes so much a part of all his roles (American Beauty being, of course, the penultimate).Please rent this movie.  It isn't just for Spacey fans (of which I'm one), it's for anybody who needs to know that every dark cloud has a silver lining.  And, like my title suggests, it's great comfort food, especially in winter.

We also get only the briefest explanation of Spacey's character & what made him the man he was.No explanation of what the attraction was other than purely physical to his wife (and none as to why she was attracted to him.) So the first 30 minutes or so of the film, upon which events are based, is really given only the briefest of treatment.However, once on the Rock (NFLD) the story takes flight. Scott Glenn gives another solid performance and who cannot but appreciate the work of Gordon Pinsent, looking every bit the part of the Newfoundlander that in his heart he must be.A film that is worth a look, if only for the individual performances that are turned in.

The story is about a man who was beaten down so much, first by his evil father and then by his wife that he felt he was worthless and not able to really cope with life. However when his aunt (Dame Judi Dench) comes into his life and transports him to his roots in Newfoundland his life changes and he thrives.

The film provides a great atmosphere to the brutally harsh environment all these people endured, but somehow, I didn't find the emotional connection to the movie or feel for the main character Quoyle.  Maybe because of they way they cast him, basically being a spineless dimwitted nice guy who, by the way, has to face his demonic past.  He might be written that way so that the Prowse character could easily fall in love with him.  If someone were more troubled or disturbed on the outside, it would be very hard for another person to be attracted to him without him having some a redeeming heart deep down inside.I think Kevin Spacey tried to hard to be that character.  Although he fully immersed himself into it, what comes out is a person who doesn't have a wide range of emotions.  So what he basically did was creating a caricature portrayal of a slow wimp, with being wimpy his only emotion.Figuring the film was from Lasse Hallstrom, you think he would make a heart-wrenching film, but he didn't completely succeed in this one.  Throwing the storyilne of the novel while trying to preserve it overall meaning will frequently lead to an incoherent attempt to convey the original message, which is what seem to have happened here.Still, not too bad a movie, mostly for the gorgeous views of Newfoundland, interesting side stories and some decent performances, notably from Julie Dench.

Solidly built on the backs of veteran actors, helped by a script that skilfully avoids the sense of hurried action common in book-based films, the entire project is pulled together by Kevin Spacey (R. G. Quoyle). I cannot say enough about an actor who has consistently shined in every major role to-date. Aside from solid performances by Judi Dench (Agnis Hamm), Julianne Moore (Wavey Prowse), the fantastic acting performance of the film, complementing Spacey, is Scott Glenn (Jack Buggit), who proves the theory, you don't need eons of screentime to make a major impact.

Annie Proulx, it has to be infinitely better than this movie. Whereas a book might take a person ten hours to read and have the scope and time to flesh out characters and situations without compromising a central narrative, a two hour film cannot. In the Shipping News movie we are constantly being introduced to little moments or quirky characters that have no discernable bearing on the film and simply distract at the pace by which they're dispensed. Take, for example, the carpenter working on the house. In about a two minute scene we are told the story of why he and his father (Spacey's boss) do not get along. Then, absolutely nothing about this revelation is even mentioned until, at the last moment his recently-resuscitated father barks out that all is forgiven in a kind of voice-over as he is whisked away on a gurney. The inclusion of this story-line (such that it is) is entirely useless to the general plot and one can only imagine that it was kept in to somehow accommodate the hordes who will scream that IT WASN'T THAT WAY IN THE BOOK!I had the exact same sensation watching The Shipping News as I did during Angela's Ashes - another noted book I had not read but knew the movie was based on. Every scene seemed to be fraught with some vague deeper significance that was surely fleshed out with memories of fuller descriptions from the book for those who had read it, but which was completely unsupported by the film itself.Novels are episodic, divided into chapters and made long enough that no one is expected to read them in one sitting. They are meant to be savoured as much in the moments away from them as when one is in the midst of reading. They actually get better the longer it takes to read them and one arguably does a disservice to a novel to read it all at once. As such, novels generally make lousy movies since movies, more like short stories, are meant to be consumed all at once and digested later. I'm sure a fine novel like The Shipping News would have been much better served by an HBO miniseries-type production like Tom Hanks's Band of Brothers in order to let its breadth of scope be realized.

Anytime a movie mentions a storm of the ages or the destruction caused by a previous calamity, that unfortunate incident is sure to repeat itself once again towards the end of the film.  The saving grace for The Shipping News is that it didn't have history repeat itself or dare I mention rehash any more cliche elements than it already had.  The plot here is actually pretty interesting once it leaves the beginning of the film and Cate Blanchett is out of the picture.  Don't get me wrong, I think Cate Blanchett is a wonderful, quality actress; however, her character is just plain evil.  This type of woman could only exist on paper or film.  I recognize that people in real life are basically stupid, but I'll give the human race the benefit of the doubt and make the outrageous claim that a woman like this doesn't exist in this day and age. Once the movie introduces Judi Dench though, it seems we're back on the right track.  Can this woman do no wrong?  She's good.  Dench was one of the few things I liked about Iris and here she really saves this movie from going down hill.  Don't get upset that I'm not giving this credit to Kevin Spacey.  He is still the man.  However, this movie belongs to Dench. Spacey and Julianne Moore can have their sappy try at romance and fulfill that part of the plot, but the soul of the story revolves around Spacey's ancestors and Dench's character.  I won't give that stuff away, but it's the best part of the movie.

In contrast to many comments by people writing here, I had no problem following the story line and understanding the movie.  Admittedly, there did seem to be a lot of plot elements that are just hinted at or lightly touched, but this is a movie that is very understandable, provided you are willing to think.  Yes, I know some people expect a movie to be passive entertainment where they just turn their brains off.  But, they have plenty of movies to watch without having to see this one.Overall, the story of Quoyle, his hard life and damaged daughter, are very strong.  The tie-ins to the Quoyle past serve to reinforce the character and the story.  The only thing wrong with this movie is the Quoyle/Prowse love story.  It was just way too easy.  They fell into each others arms with no tension, no effort.  Given the tragic undertones of the movie, that contrast was just too much and did not work well at all.  It probably works well in the book because the motivations can be developed better.  But, on screen it was too much they are written for each other from the moment they catch each other's eyes.  This really prevents any chemistry from developing between the characters.Another complaint about this movie is the overuse of dream sequences and imagery.  They come off as heavy handed and the is it real or a dream effect is very much a movie cliché.Other than the seriously broken love subplot, this is a strong film with some interesting performances.  Judi Dench as the elderly aunt returning the Quoyle name to Newfoundland was very good.  Scott Glenn turns in a masterful performance.  The accents are passable, and the scenery incredible.

All I knew was that two great performers starred in it -- Academy Award-winners Kevin Spacey and Judi Dench -- and that the director was hit-and-miss Lasse Halstrom -- who is responsible for the controversial The Cider House Rules and the critically acclaimed Chocolat. What I got out of watching The Shipping News was the feeling that I had discovered a modern classic that, although discarded by most as an everyday drama, will gain its place in the hearts of movie-goers everywhere. The film is about a man named Quoyle (Spacey) who -- in the time period of just a few days -- ~*~ POSSIBLE SPOILERS ~*~ loses his wife and both of his parents, left only with a confused daughter named Bunny. Everything changes, however, when a distant aunt (Dench) appears on his doorstep and invites him to go with her to their homeland, Newfoundland. He accepts the offer and leaves at once, taking Bunny with him. As soon as they are submerged in this faraway place of beauty and solitude, Quoyle's emotional wounds begin to heal... but his demons still haunt him. The Shipping News is mainly about recovery it's about having to confront your fears and face your past. It's about losing everything -- including hope -- and winning it all back. These elements may seem cliched, but trust me The Shipping News is ANYTHING but trite. Although labeled a drama, there are many intense and suspenseful parts in this movie (i.e., ~*~ SPOILER ~*~ a sequence in which Quoyle finds a headless body floating in the ocean). I suppose what I mainly appreciated about The Shipping News was that it used its running time to its fullest so many movies last for hours on end when they really only require about forty minutes to accomplish the necessities. Running at about two hours, The Shipping News keeps the viewer riveted from the very beginning to the anti-climactic end. All performances are excellent -- especially Julianne Moore, who continues to prove herself as one of the finest actresses of this generation -- and the score is both beautiful and haunting. I highly recommend The Shipping News to anyone who appreciates a unique drama with a fascinating story and breathtaking scenery.

I just hope that no teenager watches this absurd, somber and sad example of how you can get through Live without any skills and only having sick thoughts or urges on your mind. And this is the same director that did What's eating Gilbert Grape. Lasse must suffer under the Spielberg disease.

The weather is rarely anything but rainy or cold, all color is drained away (either by the weather or by all of the suffering everyone endures...or maybe the camera is just broken), mommies and daddies desert their children (or try to sell them into slavery), families are burdened by age-old curses, and everything is generally pretty abysmal.In the end, however, we learn about the triumph of the human spirit...I think.The movie is well acted, or something, and you will probably walk away feeling like you just watched a very powerful film, but I think that the real lesson of the movie is that Cate Blanchett and everyone who lives in Newfoundland are all pretty worthless.

Although a very good director, Lasse Hallstrom attempts to juggle a lot of stories in one movie; one issue after another comes up with no chance of developing properly and then a sudden resolution, and on to the next one; hard to keep pace and interest with all the happenings. Although an excellent actor, Kevin Spacey tries his hands in portraying a totaly different character then what we have seen in him so far; a loser with no confidence. He has too much of a presence and not enough depth (in this movie)to shed his previously conveyed image of sinister, at times sleezy, overpowering and overconfident characterizations. Unfortunately I could not see him as the title Quoyle and felt like he was trying too hard to go against his typecasting. The ladies fared much better. As it has been proved, Cate Blanchett and Dame Judi Dench can do no wrong, and even the at times unreliable Julianne Moore does a good job.

But all the way through it I kept saying to myself This is really a GOOD film! The acting is outstanding and there were no weak performances. Reading all of the reviews so far I was amazed at the ignorance of geography of many of the reviewers. Newfoundland is a very large island east of the mouth of the Saint Lawrence river. It was originally populated by Irish from the Dingle Peninsula of lower southwest Ireland. It was a member of the British Empire until becoming part of Canada in 1949 and thus little-influenced by Canada in its customs. Just as everyone in the American south do not have exactly the same accent; just like some people are sopranos, tenors, basses, etc.,their accents will be somewhat similar but not the same. I found Kevin Spacey's acting extraordinary even amongst a wealth of magnificent performances. I could have done without Cate Blanchett's buttocks on display and felt 100's of actresses could have played the part as well. But the choice of Julianne Moore was a bit of genius. We see a woman who is very attractive looking as if she is wearing no makeup, belonging in Newfoundland and is able to act with her face without dialogue. The story is more intellectual than action-motivated and will appeal to only a certain number of people. For those who complain the movie doesn't match the novel, read the book again but read it as fast as you can and only allow yourself two hours to read it and see how much can be covered in that time. Then you will learn to appreciate how well the director has used his two hours. Those who like this film should watch the DVD and turn it on to the audible commentary of the director, screenwriter and producers to learn about the weather's swift changes -snow, sunshine, fog, sleet, rain all occurring on the same day what they were trying to imply and why certain scenes were left out.

After having a couple of miserable years in which she still plays the hooker type and has no love for the child or him, Spacey ends up alone with his child after a fatal accident his child's mother had. When he meets his aunt, he leaves with her and his child to his ancestors´ home village. There, he finds out the truth about his ancestors&#133;&#133;&#133;This is a great movie from beginning to end. The actor's performances are extremely good. Kevin Spacey again acts his ass off and I was deeply moved by his appearance. Another great actor in this movie is Julianne Moore. She seems to pick very good movies to play in and gives away a very strong performance again, I'm really on the way with becoming a big fan of hers. Cate Blanchett, as always, acts very good also. The rest of the cast was also great, nothing but good acting in this movie. This movie really deepens the main character, which is a very big pro by me. The story is brought to you a bit fast though, so you have to keep paying attention. The plot is very, very good and very moving. Watching the movie, you haven't got a clue where the story is going, but I can tell you it goes somewhere! Another very positive thing about the movie is the sound track. It's very beautiful and goes well with the story and landscapes. SPOILING TIMEAt the end, the Quoyle´s house falls during the very big storm. Bunny (Spacey´s child) sees that, but at exactly the same time, Quoyle finally goes to Wavey to show his love to her. The fact that that happened at the same moment was because with the house blowing away, Quoyle´s hunting past also blows away and he can finally be with another women. NOT SPOILING ANYMORESo, after playing in some masterpieces, Spacey did it again. He now comes up with a very good not-Hollywood-type of movie. His next movie, K-Pax, is also very good and Spacey is on his way to become a really legendary actor, maybe even the best of his generation. Julianne Moore is becoming someone to watch more and more and Cate Blanchett keeps interesting me. In sum, this is a very good movie if you love a good plot, good acting and deepened characters. If you just want to watch a Hollywood movie with action, don't go see it this movie deserves more than that. 8 out of 10. A very big eight!

Of course we, as an audience, can already pinpoint the film's moral message, given the fact that this is a character-based meller with plenty of saccharine sentiment and gorgeous cinematography. The surprise here is the director, Lasse Hallström, instills the film with enough interest to keep it afloat, with a little help from his cast along the way. The film stars Kevin Spacey against type as Quoyle, a boy whose life has been shaped by the years of physical and emotional torment at the hands of his father. Life as Quoyle experiences it is simple and colorless, until he crosses paths with Petal (Cate Blanchett), a drifter who happens into his life one day and becomes his everything. This woman is a class act she stays out late while a despondent Quoyle remains home with their daughter, Bunny, all the while pleading with Petal to give their marriage another try.One momentous day, Quoyle receives word of his father's death, and returns home from the funeral to find Petal and Bunny gone from his life. Enter Agnis Hamm (Judi Dench), his aunt from his father's side who has stopped by to pay her respects on her way back to Newfoundland, where their family's ancestry lies. After news of Petal's death and the return of Bunny, Quoyle makes the decision to travel to Newfoundland with Agnis in hopes of regaining some semblance of order in life once again. Once the story makes the transition to the coldly atmospheric coast of Newfoundland, more characters are introduced, more of Quoyle's family history is revealed, much to the silent dismay of Agnis, who would rather keep the wrongdoings of her family hidden from view. Quoyle attain a job at the local newspaper, makes good with editor Jack Buggit (Scott Glenn), who takes a liking to the fact that his work stirs up interest in the town; later, he awards Quoyle his own weekly column. As Quoyle makes his rounds, he meets interesting faces, and takes a liking to the local daycare operator, Wavey Prowse (Julianne Moore), a conserved woman with a young boy who suffers from minor mental defects. The movie has two main things going for it its cast and its wonderfully dense appearance. As Quoyle, Spacey is required to express emotion through words and facial expression, and achieves both very convincingly despite the lack of development of his character. Dench does well in portraying Agnis as reserved and quiet, while Moore shows a great deal of warmth and emotion; both actresses succeed in keeping us mystified by their characters' pasts, making the revelations more impacting and heartfelt. Various actors, including Glenn, Jason Behr, Pete Postlethwaite and more, play the local townsfolk very well; also worth mentioning is the short-lived but effectively chilling performance from Blanchett, who proves her versatility as an actress in portraying Petal as one of the lowest forms of life.The look of The Shipping News is nothing short of breathtaking, containing its fair share of beautiful vistas that evoke the grandeur and beauty of Newfoundland. Seeing this film's setting unfold reminded me of such films as The Horse Whisperer and Snow Falling on Cedars, where the setting plays a role in the film. Here, the same type of approach is applied, and succeeds for the most part in grabbing our attention in between character development. So what's the purpose of it all? Well, as far as I can tell, it's a coming-to-grips story in which people realize their fears and their hidden secrets and make peace with their inner torments. However, it seems that everyone but the intended character achieves this both Agnis and Wavey face a part of their past they have long since ignored, while Buggit, after a near-death experience, reconciles with his son. Even little Bunny accepts her mother's death, but Quoyle himself spends more time helping these people deal with their emotional grief rather than devoting time to dealing with his own. One might gather that through helping those around him, Quoyle is making his own realization, which comes at the movie's weirdly cut-off ending. Maybe he does, maybe he doesn't. One could argue that the lack of developing his character does not merit this deduction about his coming-to-grips with life. Even still, Hallström keeps all of this moving at a pace where no one in the audience is required to put much thought into what they see, providing us a movie where one can simply relax and enjoy the experience. This is somewhat similar of one of his previous films, What's Eating Gilbert Grape, which derived its complexity through its simplistic approach. And while The Shipping News may not be as complex as some of Hallström's previous efforts, his many artistic touches are felt throughout much of this acceptably melodramatic landscape of self-realization.The 'R' rating wad totally undeserved. It could have gone with a gambled PG-13. Sure there is a very short sex scene, and brief language, but I have seen far worse that have earned the R, instead of the NC-17.10/102001 125 minutes Rated R CC.

So my comment is a bit spoiled by the fact that I couldn't help comparing the movie and the book all the way through. Lasse Hallstrom's movie is well written, beautifully set and features an excellent cast. Even though Kevin Spacey is physically the opposite of Quoyle (as he's described in the novel), he manages to become him through a very fine acting work on posture, intonations and glances. Judi Dench and Cate Blanchett are just as good playing, respectively, Agnis Hamm (the aunt) and Petal Bear (Quoyle's wife). However, the screenplay simplifies the story by many dimensions that are crucial in the book Quoyle's life in Mockinburg NY as dull reporter before moving to Newfoundland; the progressive revelation of past events that changed the characters lives, and most of all the portrait of unforgettable characters as Billy Pretty and Jack Buggit, whose role in the movie is dramatically re-sized.Filmmaking requirements took away something from the novel, but the result is a very good, slow movie, all focused on characters and the mysterious relationship between man and nature. 8/10!

The former because I *so* enjoyed the book and I first heard they were making the film *so* long ago (seems like a couple of years) and I *so* wanted it to be as good as the book. The latter because I knew that the director was Lasse Hallström who had made such a mess of Chocolat, turning a dark bitter Belgian chocolate bar of a book into a sickly sweet box of Quality Street of a film.In the end I was justified on both counts, though fortunately more on the former. The book is long-ish and highly fragmented (39 chapters) but the film manages to cram in most of the important stuff, although there are points where you can blink and miss crucial developments. Meanwhile Hallström's sweet tooth has indeed been at work once again, but fortunately he started with a setting of such bleak windswept salty unforgiving grimness that he's ended up with something resembling sugar-coated bitter almonds (pardon the mixed metaphor; just be glad I didn't try to work in the seal flipper pie!)Struggling to straighten out their lives in the face of the weather and the local delicacies are a near-perfect cast including Kevin Spacey, Judi Dench, Julianne Moore and Pete Postlethwaite (I'll admit I'm biased, I could watch Kevin Spacey all day, if they made a film of my life I'd pick him to play me!); Cate Blanchett makes a good stab at the horribly self-centred Petal in the first (pre-Newfoundland) reel, although the Petal of my imagination is even more petulant and unreliable (think Uma Thurman in Pulp Fiction but poorer, more ragged and a lot more uninhibited). Oh, and if you saw him in Notting Hill, you'll be taken aback by Rhys Ifans' well-honed Home Counties accent here. It certainly makes up for Dench's and Moore's rather wavering attempts at Newfoundlandese.A word of warning, though. This film is not for the squeamish if you don't care much for near-drownings, beheadings or lingering close-ups of fish being gutted, go and see a nice war film instead (funny how they never show human guts, isn't it?)7.5/10.

All I say is that this critic's favourite films must be 'Pearl Harbour', 'Armageddon' and 'Tombraider'. What makes 'The Shipping News' great?  For a start the ensemble cast is magnificent. Kevin Spacey, who (in my opinion) excels at conveying vulnerability and enigma is a wonderful Quoyle, managing to engage our sympathies whilst still retaining an air of mystery which runs from beginning to end.  Dame Judi Dench's magnificence goes without saying - here she is simply wonderful, managing to communicate years of pent up suffering and pain with just one expression, one look of her eyes. The fabulous Cate Blanchett literally explodes onto the screen as Petal, Quoyle's promiscuous wife. Yet the star of the show for me was the excellent Julianne Moore. As an actress of extraordinary range, down-to-earth beauty and versatility, here she confirms her gift, as the film's 'love interest' Wavey Prowse. She is luminous, powerful, loving, endearing and plausible. A joy to watch.  The direction. I found Lasse Hallstrom's last film 'Chocolat' magical and sumptuous to watch, yet somehow lacking in substance. In 'The Shipping News' Hallstrom uses his camera to weave a magical spell, creating a world of muted blues and greens, which perfectly conveys the sense of hidden magic and mystery that is key to this film's success. The lilting, haunting score only serves to emphasise the subdued beauty of Hallstrom's images. This is a film which captures you and draws you into its magical world - testament to Hallstrom's skill as a director. I suspect that those who found 'Chocolat' a little too light and insubstantial would appreciate the darker, more profound nature of his latest offering. For me it is far superior. What I adored about 'The Shipping News' is what some would cite as its flaw - its slowness and apparent 'lack' of plot. We live in a climate where film tastes tend to lean towards the big budget, hi concept blockbuster. There seems to be a constant demand for action, explosions, teen flicks, Barbie doll type women and Ken doll style men. How refreshing then to be given the opportunity to watch an intelligent film which meanders, which doesn't pander to dominant audience taste, which demands you to think, which is a feast for the eyes as well as engaging your brain. For what it's worth, I adored 'The Shipping News' and honestly believe that many of its critics dislike it for its 'un Hollywood' nature, and its pondering narrative.   If you only like your films heavily populated with aliens, crude gags explosions and boobs, then it is probably advisable to give this little gem a miss. You won't find rapid editing, excessive violence and abundant special FX, but you WILL find a wonderful script, a stellar cast, not to mention sumptuous direction and cinematography.

I have never read the book so I can't compare the movie to it, but after seeing the movie I certainly plan to seek out the book and look forward to a good read. The meat behind this film definately lays in the acting.  Kevin Spacey is wonderful as the wimpy, quiet Quoyle.  Judi Dench is surprisingly understated, which is a treat because she does it so well and serves to back up Spacey's role.  Julianne Moore is also very good, and the role of the small girl, Bunny, is done solidly by the Gainer triplets.  I think these girls will have a good future ahead of them if they keep playing good roles like this one. Cate Blanchett almost literally explodes on the screen, completely stealing the screen for the 5-10 minutes of screen time that she has.  The role of her character, Petal, is a bit of a departure from the roles she normally plays, and she handles it with ease, and turns what is essentially an unlikeable character, into a character with which the audience can have empathy for. The rest of the cast each pull off their characters with aplomb. As for plot, well there's not much of one in this film.  This film is all about the development of the main character and the slow but sure unravelling of his story and the story of those around him.  Even for the lack of plot one isn't bored for a moment, thanks to the acting skills of Spacey, Dench, Moore and Blanchett.  There are several witty moments, even a couple of laugh out loud jokes.  The darker moments of the storyline - suicide, murder, rape, death - are largely dealt with by a touch of humor or given a quick going over.  Perhaps a failing of the film is the failure to explore these parts, and it would have given the story and characters a bit more depth.All in all a pleasure to watch.

His combination of casting, controlled acting techniques, cinematography and music paint pictures you may not see if you aren't prepared.  He has done this beautifully with The Shipping News.He begins by understanding that Newfoundland must not only be the setting for the film, but also the main character.  Then he helps the actors understand that they are just a part of telling a story that conveys the spirit of Newfoundland.  It is Newfoundland itself that the actors are supporting, and Newfoundland itself that builds the characters.  The use of music and cinematography make palpable the cold and warmth of Newfoundland simultaneously, and make a possibly gloomy, downtrodden plot seem positive and optimistic.To make sure the job is done correctly, he employs excellent casting, for the most part.  Kevin Spacey's work here has been compared extensively to that of his American Beauty character, in that the shift of his personality from meek to bold is similar.  But I didn't find that to be true.  I thought Spacey conveyed Quoyle as tired and put-upon, but optimistic to the end.  It was as if he was living his unfortunate life without realizing it was all that unfortunate, until good things started happening for him.  He made me feel as if his character was child-like and accepting, which is very much not the case in American Beauty.I thought Cate Blanchett was remarkable and real.  Judi Dench was totally believable, and delivered a terrific performance, despite some struggle with the accent.  Julianne Moore was fine, although it seemed her trouble with the accent provided her with some trouble with her character, slipping out from time to time.The supporting cast was excellently chosen.  Scott Glenn, Pete Postlethwaite and Rhys Ifans were all quite effective as the newspaper crew.  The greatest accolades, though, should go to Gordon Pinsent as Billy Pretty.  His role was not the biggest, and his critiques have not been the brightest.  But after seeing him in this performance, I feel very protective of him and of his part in this film, and must say that he is being greatly underestimated, as I imagine he has been throughout his career (based on how little we hear of him here in the States).  He has such a grasp and thorough understanding of the character that he practically blends in with the setting.  There is nothing contrived about his delivery; dialogue rolls off of his tongue (I'm sure being a native Newfoundlander helped).  He wears his beard and costume as if he's never worn anything else.  He is as at east with this role as I have ever seen any actor on film.  And perhaps that is why he is not getting the attention he deserves--he is TOO natural!  The quality of his work will have one of two effects either he will steal every scen he's in because of his appearance and technique; or he will go unnoticed because of his complete believability.  I'm sure he won't get it, for whatever reason, but this man deserves a Best Supporting Actor Oscar.The story may not be one worth telling.  And the writing, closely resembling that of the novel, may not always be authentically Newfoundland.  But if you have already seen this picture, I encourage you to see it again bearing in mind that it is Newfoundland and its people that have a story to tell, and that these actors have done a good job in playing a role in that story. Look again, especially, at Gordon Pinsent, and see if you agree with my assessment.  He understands acting as it is meant to be done.

Though born and raised in the capital city (St. John's), my mother hails from Long Harbour, Placentia bay, a small outport community very much like that represented by 'Killet claw', and much of the imagery in the film hit very close to home for me, but in a very good way. seeing the salt box houses, and sea stages, the old winter coats and knitted caps and sweaters, visually, this film is perfect. In terms of acting, Judi Dench is flawless, Julianne moore is perfect, the men of the Gammy Bird all elegantly cast, and Kevin Spacy was simply remarkable to watch, he was neither mainlander nor Typical Newfoundlander, very low key, very simple to understand, a very human character, something i'm not used to from Spacey.Story wise, the film is more of a slice-of-life piece than the book, not so much emphasis is placed on individual events, but rather the experience as a whole. If you aren't the sort of person who can merely sit and soak in what's happening, than you will not get this film. Also the climax and resolution are very low key moments, which may leave some scratching their heads.My strong liking for this film probably stems from the small piece of identity i share with the characters, Newfoundland is not simply the backdrop or the setting, those farmiliar with our culture and heritage will see that We, culturally, are as much a character in the film as Quoyle or Weavy or Agnes. There are moments however where the film misses the mark, or does things that I, as a Newfoundlander, can instantly identify with, and yet, (judging from other comments on this site) other people will immediately dismiss or simply not understand. Quoyle immediately getting a job as a reporter with only an ink-setter's background, the almost cartoon-ish portrayal of the folk when it comes to boats and the water, the thick accents, and even the no-holds barred nature of the festivities shown in the film. These are all examples. Newfoundlanders are a connundrum, we are simple, yet more complex than many, we are friendly and hospitable to a fault, yet our feathers ruffle easily and more often than not, especially where males are concerned, violence and long standing fueds are not uncommon. These elements of our society may be mis-understood by the vast majority of people, and to be honest, the only way to understand is to live here. But where the movie misses, is it's primitive portrayal of the above. We are not primitive, we are not savages (or most of us aren't), and we are most certainly not so malicious as some of the characters were portrayed. The movie tends to emphasize our qualities a little, and it really focuses on extremes rather than showing the bigger picture, it Makes Spacey's Quoyle look like an outsider, when he's actually the closest to the mark of the whole bunch.Rest assured at any rate, from a Newfoundlander's perspective, this film paints an accurate picture of island life in the outskirts, even if it isn't what one could call a typical Newfoundland story (the upcoming Lion's Gate film Rare Birds starring William Hurt looks more like a typical Newfoundland tale of quirkiness)and i for one would love to see the film industry return to our little corner of North America (far EAST, not north!)and leave with a bigger slice of our cultural pie.

For your next car trip, or to listen to while you commute, visit your local library and borrow The Shipping News on tape. These are produced for visually impaired or blind readers.  It is abridged, but the flavour of the book is fully brought to life. It is read by Robert Joy, the actor who played the cop at the car accident that Quoyle covers for the paper.

The messages in his films often suggest that moral boundaries are crossed more often than not, and everyone eventually has to face the skeletons in their closets. In his latest film, The Shipping News, Hallstrom continues in this tradition exceptionally well. The problem is, the film is based on the Pulitzer-prize winning novel of the same name by E. Annie Proulx, and films often pale in comparison to their literary counterparts. This film is no exception.                                   The movie stars Kevin Spacey, as the                                    hapless Mr. Quoyle, a simpleton who                                    works as an ink setter for a newspaper.                                    He fumbles into a marriage in name only,                                    and has a child named Bunny. His wife dies about ten years later, after having sold their                                    daughter to a black market adoption agency and trying to escape with a barfly she                                    recently met. It's when Quoyle's father dies that his life takes a change. It turns out his                                    father had a stepsister named Agnis (Judi Dench), who shows up one day to claim his                                    ashes, and Quoyle decides to follow her back to Newfoundland, with daughter Bunny in                                    tow. There, the three begin a new life in the long-abandoned house his father and Agnis                                    grew up in, and where Quoyle slowly learns of his ugly family secrets of murder, incest                                    and rape. Through a complex series of events and relationships, Quoyle evolves a new                                    sense of reconciliation and purpose in life As a churning backdrop of the cold and desolate seascape of Canada's Newfoundland, the movie evokes the same emotions from its characters and from the audience. Mood is the major strength of the film, and is done so effectively that it almost overshadows its weaker points. All the performances are top-notch, the story is compelling, and the messages are cognizant of human emotion. So, what's wrong? It's Quoyle himself. This isn't really Kevin Spacey's fault; there's no question that his performance is one of his best, and this grade-A film owes its success to the depth and warmth he portrays. No, it's that there is still something not quite right about the character that irked me. To understand that, we have to go to the source the book itself.                                   I hesitate to do this so reactively, since                                    literary works and movies are inherently                                    different narrative forms, and comparing                                    one with the other is, in my opinion, like                                    comparing apples and oranges. Movies, by their nature, are forced to focus on a smaller                                    set of issues than a book, but, if done well, they can be extraordinarily moving on the                                    same storyline. The challenge for a filmmaker is to choose which parts of the book to                                    adapt and express well. In the case of The Shipping News, the main thrust of the book                                    is Quoyle. Ms. Proulx's characterization of him is that of a physically grotesque and                                    freakish oaf, and it is partially this persona that makes the impact of the things that                                    happen to him have the profound effect that is felt from the book. By contrast, Spacey's                                    portrayal of Quoyle is too normal and likeable, both in his personality and his physical                                    presence to have the kinds of quirks and inconsistently positive/negative behaviors that                                    he's supposed to have.There are other differences in depictions between the film and the novel, but I can more easily forgive them as creative interpretations by two equally gifted story-tellers and mediums. That Hallstrom beautifies scenics or other features of the story that the novel is less sentimental about is an example of this. Again, the book was much better, but the movie is hardly an unmoving experience. It's fantastic. But not acknowledging the main thrust of the main character is where I take exception. I understand that it's nearly impossible to compress an incredible novel into a two hour movie, so I'm more forgiving than others may be. In fact, as a film, I found The Shipping News to be one of the best I've seen in ages. If you don't read the book, you may even agree.

Certainly, if the creators are to be judged based on their integrity in depicting the movie's setting and people then the Shipping News rates quite highly.The movie get full marks for capturing much of that which makes coastal Newfoundland unique the variable nature of the weather (yes, we get snow in May); the unique Newfoundland accent, masterfully captured by Judi Dench (Agnes), and the employees of The Gammy Bird (at least by those who are supposed to be from Newfoundland); unique dishes such as seal flipper pie (its an acquired taste); our unique brews; the rugged coast dotted by random collections of salt box houses; the importance of the small boat fishery; the preponderance of eccentric characters; and the sense of family and community ties.  The movie also captures the sense of decay that is sadly more and more typical of many coastal communities.  With the collapse of the ground fishery entire regions of coastal Newfoundland, once dotted by thriving outports, have been virtually abandoned.Somewhat disappointing is the fact that the movie does not capture the contrast between life in Killick Claw (Trinity Blight) - the setting for much of the movie - and in other parts of Newfoundland.  The book on which the movie is based affords the potential for such contrast but the relevant sections have not been brought to screen.   The rural way of life certainly exists side by side with practically all aspects modern society.  Failing to place Killick Claw in contrast to its larger community, notably the capital of the province (as the book does), diminishes an important aspect of the novel - the image of a community that is largely stuck in time.The movie also falls short in neglecting to capture the sense of bitterness - as the book does - that many Newfoundlanders feel toward central Canada and the federal government which are seen as looking the other way while the seas were raped of the fish that sustained life in coastal areas for centuries.  However, the creators can be forgiven if the movie falls short of a political commentary.  As the story of a man who finds redemption and meaning in the far away place of his forefathers, it is captivating.Many in Newfoundland will probably be sensitive to some of the more controversial aspects of the movie the incest, rape, murder, adultery and so on that depict Quole's family past and feel that the movie depicts Newfoundlanders in a negative light.  Certainly Newfoundland has its share of crime, notably family crime.  However, such are all too common aspects of the human condition and to suggest that they do not exist in Newfoundland is to ignore our human nature.Overall, I was struck by how well the movie's creators have managed to capture much of the flavour of rural Newfoundland, even if in doing so they glossed over serveral aspects of the novel.

This is the life of a little town in Northern Canada where beaten-down, broken-hearted Quoyle (Spacey) begins a second life with his daughter Bunny. Judi Dench plays his aunt who arrives to visit the ashes of her father and finds her nephew distraught over the death of both his parents, his missing (and later revealed dead) wife, and kidnapped daughter. She whisks them away to a small village where our people are from.Here Quoyle must make a life out of an old family home; find his way as a novice reporter with the local paper, get over his unloving and deceased wife, and the indifference of his screwed-up child. Everywhere there are secrets; the house harbors some, his past harbors a few, and dear old Aunt hides a few family secrets herself. This is one of those basic movies with a good storyline and deep acting and a lovely, non-memorable soundtrack that will win a few great reviews and then fade out of existence like the clouds forever dotting the horizon. There was nothing edgy or exciting about this film, yet I still recommend it because both Kevin Spacey and Judi Dench are remarkable actors. There's some obvious gaps in the storyline that I can only guess are fleshed out in the book; however the story moves along fittingly. The little girl (played by triplets Kaitlyn, Alyssa, and Lauren Gainer) steals half the scenes; the carpenter (Jason Behr) may rise to stardom some day himself.While this certainly isn't the best movie I've seen I say it's the perfect movie to see on a dreary rainy day, with a first date, or simply as a rental with your family. "},{"Title":"Schlepping Snooze","Date":"27 December 2001","Score":"","Genre":"Drama","Review":" In my opinion Lasse Hallström 's new movie, erroneously entitled Shipping News, is not really based on the book Shipping News. However, it may well be based on a condensation of the classic comic, Shipping News, I don't really know, not yet having read the classic comic. (In fact, maybe this movie maybe just the trailer of the condensed ...?).Perhaps it was too much to expect that the Pulitzer Prize winning story carefully crafted in Annie Proulx's 337 page novel could make it to the silver screen (no, make that grayish-brown) unscathed. But hacked to bits, and then recycled, this impersonation of the Proulx's moving story has been gouged almost beyond recognition. So much is cut out that it appears to me Hallström was just trying finish it super quick because he didn't want to get caught in the next Newfoundland storm.One cannot lay much blame with the cast members, Kevin Spacey, Julianne Moore, Judi Dench, Gordon Pinsent, etc. who all give credible, if hurried, performances in those parts of the original story that avoided the cutting room floor.Now that I think a little more about it, here we have a case in which the television medium would probably have served up the story better than cinema. Let me imagine how an enlightened TV producer who had actually read Proulx's tale would proceed with this project.Firstly he'd make it into a mini-series of about four or five two hour segments (restricting the commercial breaks to the top of the hour).Secondly, he'd recruit Steven Spielberg or even Quentin Tarantino to direct it. They'd certainly let some humor bubble up once in a while.Thirdly, he'd have the new director restore deleted characters Partridge, the black newspaperman who got Quoyle started as a reporter, Sunshine, Quoyle's youngest daughter who plays foil to sister Bunny, and Agnis's toothless dog, Howard, who plays a pivotal role in subtly explaining her life style. (And, although Spacey's Quoyle was pretty good, probably John Malkovitch's would be better.)Fourthly, because Quoyle's development is really a series of episodes, the series should reflect this. And consequently, he'd make damn sure Nutbeam's riotous party, its preparations, and its aftermath, were one two hour episode in itself. Show the tub!Fifthly, he should buy the TV cameraman some color film for the Newfoundland shots. I'm sure this is no more expensive than the dreary sepia tones that Hallström seems to have preferred, Check with the Newfie Chamber of Commerce. The sun actually does shine on some days.Finally, if Hallström 's scriptwriter writer ever had the temerity to show up on the TV production set, the producer's security guards might, in retribution for what he did to the Proulx's story, threaten to stuff him into the nearest wood chipper.However, notwithstanding my criticisms, Hallström 's thing he calls Shipping News is a passable if mediocre entertainment, but it should NOT be seen by anyone who has actually read Prouxl's book. They'd be sorely disappointed.P.S. I really did thoroughly enjoy Hallström 's successful work, Ciderhouse Rules.

Spacey overplays his underplaying, mumbling just enough to make you listen. When you listen you realize he doesn't have anything profound to say. Moore is in her red-headed, peaches and cream glory.

He's evolved from playing a subway thief to Hollywood's A-list. So here he is, back to making drama, recently The Shipping News.The Shipping News is actually a newspaper that runs in New Foundland. Quoyle (Kevin Spacey) is a brokedown loser who is timid and can't express himself, except through smirks and only a whisper of a speaking voice. His wife Petal (Cate Blanchett) is nothing but a sham, and leaves and dies. Quoyle is only left with his daughter, and his aunt Agnis (Judi Dench). His parents have died, and aunt Agnis moves Quoyle to New England. It turns out that Quoyle is a part of the town-- or his ancestors anyway. He becomes a news reporter for The Shipping News, and this unfolds his past, a few mysteries, revelations, and Quoyle's evolution from timid to happy and content.Speaking of evolution, this is a big change from Spacey, from his previous roles of Prot and Lester Burnham in K-PAX and American Beauty. He falls in the middle from the cynical, nothing-to-lose character of Lester and the down-to-earth, calm, and spaced-out Prot, to be Quoyle, the quiet, timid man. He does a spectacular job in which we don't immediately recognize the kind of character by just knowing him, rather just a face whom we don't know. He captures the script and takes it to a whole nother level. Need I say more?Blanchett falls a little flat, shadowed by Julliane Moore. Judi Dench is the best actress among the three, shopwing humor, sensitivity and a casual attitude.The movie itself is very quiet and peaceful, though there are a few disturbing moments-- 4 or 5. It has its humor and drama, and it is very interesting, whenever Spacey's on screen. The scene stealer being Rhys Ifans, Quoyle's coworker at the Shipping News, as the obvious comic relief and Spacey's for subtle and quiet comic relief (IBM, please). It has a very complicated story that's strongly put together, with deep characters that are diverse. The little subplots make different followings, and overall a story about life that captures life, not as just an event that captures everyone's eye, but a series of different events going on around the same time, and the complex ongoings in a little New Foundland town.Headline Oscar Worthy Movie OpensSub-Headline Three's a Charm For Spacey "},{"Title":"JASON BEHR WAS GREAT!","Date":"25 December 2001","Score":"","Genre":"Drama","Review":"  I found the movie to be very boring and way to serious.

Was it Hemingway who coined the phrase Telling it like it is? I can't remember. It doesn't matter as Hemingway is not writing this review and I'm telling it like it isn't! The theme of the film is as old as life itself - the perennial 'boy meets girl'. The problem I have with The Shipping News is that while concerning itself almost entirely with how their relationship develops after they meet, it tells the boy's story before they meet in summary only while virtually ignoring that of the girl. The film is therefore unbalanced. Perhaps the novel suffers from this defect as well or was 111 minutes not long enough to do it justice? If the book does tell her story then a more satisfactory treatment would have been a trilogy, much favoured by French filmmakers, telling their two separate lives in PART I and PART II, with PART III recounting their lives after they meet.I was drawn to this film solely because I had been impressed by The Cider House Rules, which had also been directed by Lasse Hallström, but was disappointed to find that it did not come up to expectations. It had atmosphere and good photography but mostly failed. In particular the first half-hour was absolute trash. It was almost like fast-forwarding through a newsreel boy (Quoyle - KEVIN SPACEY) meets nympho (aka Petal &#150; CATE BLANCHETT), nympho promptly seduces boy, baby arrives, nympho has a series of lovers, nympho gives up baby for adoption, nympho gets killed with latest lover in car crash, boy gets baby back. The only redeeming feature seems to be a view of Cate Blanchett's seductive posterior.END OF PART I PART II MissingPART III Then JUDI DENCH as Aunt Agnis Hamm arrives on the scene and the film takes off. Judi holds the film together, without her it would not be worth watching. As the action proper begins here the film could easily start at this stage and would have worked better within its own confines with the initial part as a series of flashbacks. The real story is set on the Newfoundland coast where the location shots were made. The Canadian Maritime Province comes over as a cold, harsh, bleak and uninviting place; but this is snowy wintertime, perhaps it is much pleasanter in the sunny summer; anyway I wouldn't mind holidaying there for their fine lobster salads! Aunt Agnis drags Quoyle back to his birthplace in Newfoundland where he gets a job writing the Shipping News column for the local newspaper. I felt that the best scenes in the film were those featuring the newspaper offices where Quoyle is taught to think in terms of headlines. But unknown to Quoyle has family has a past as they were wreckers luring unsuspecting cargo ships onto the rocks. This is direct plagiarism from Daphne duMaurier's well-known novel Jamaica Inn. As for the plot, most of it is preposterous but like all fairy stories, in the end everyone lives happily ever after.

Judi Dench and Cate Blanchett received many prestigious awards and nominations, and rightly so, but the movie was really held together with Moore's portrayal of Wavey. One thing Moore does, which few actors do, is inhabit her character. The end result is that it doesn't look like she's acting, rather she IS the person in the film. Perhaps her lack of nominations stems from the fact that Wavey was portrayed differently in the film than in the book, contrasting with everything else so closely resembling my memory of the book. Wavey is strong and lively in the film, whereas in the book she is depicted much more darkly. Despite this, her performance outshines the other actors' efforts - maybe perhaps her role character doesn't have any significant occurrences, as seen in many of the leads.Despite this huge disappointment for Moore, this film is the visual epitome of what every film-maker wants when adapting a film from a book. 'The Shipping News' captures the themes of the book strikingly effectively, with each scene mirroring what I visualised whilst reading the book. In fact, the only thing which was slightly changed in the film was the character Wavey - which was discussed previously. The film stays so strong to the book, and echoes every significant issue within it so appropriately and relevantly, to create a film verging on perfection. Such book adaptions are rarely seen nowadays, but it was done to perfection here.It also looks like the role was made for Kevin Spacey. When I first discovered he would be playing Quoyle I was disappointed, as he doesn't have the height and weight which shapes Quoyle's depressed nature. But after seeing his performance, I applaud him. He brings life to the character, while also portraying each reaction Quoyle makes with austerity and significance. I believe this performance matches up with his Oscar-winning role in 'American Beauty' - a pivotal performance in the history of cinema.Judi Dench also shines as Quoyle's aunt. Her performance is, as always first class, and she honours her character's ideologies in every way possible. The only criticism I have to make about her is when Quoyle confronts her about her past - she appears to falter and doesn't react like her character did in the book. But looking past that, it is still Oscar material.Cate Blanchett also appears to be tailor-made for Petal. Her coldness and superficiality does Petal's character extreme justice - her performance is outstanding. To nitpick again, she has more aggressiveness and less bitchiness than portrayed in the book, but like Dench, the rest of her performance is so realistic and true to the book, it is still overall Oscar material.'The Shipping News' is vastly under-rated, evidenced with the abysmal rating of 6.7 it was given overall on this website. The performances are all testament to some of the finest actors of our time, and the movie portrays the book down to perfection.

Indeed few outside his native land could (or can) even pronounce the title!Now through films like Chocolat and Cider House Rules he has slowly clawed his way on to the Hollywood director's A list - but his art house roots are always showing. Unless he can start getting the ticket sales his history might well be his destiny. Whether this film helps or hinders I cannot really say at this point. (This film has one or two cop-outs - so that gives me a license too!)As you can't teach your granny how to suck eggs, you can teach the Swedes anything about introspection and depression. It is in their blood.For a healthy, well-fed, educated people they don't half like throwing themselves off buildings - especially when the Winter nights draw in.(They even make jokes about it down Stockholm way!)Despite the setting of rural Canada this is really as much about rural Sweden and the manners and mores of a world where people are more spaced out and where the sea is often your only friend. Whether you could imagine yourself voluntarily living in this setting will dictate how much you like - or otherwise - the film.There is lots of talent on display here, indeed you could make a set of iron gates and railings by melting down all the silverware won by these people. Great to see Judy Dench (very much a close neighbour of ours in her early years!) playing something other than the Queen of England. Not sure about the accent though, sounds almost Irish!While a generally slow film, Hallstrom speeds us through the early years (more like early wigs!) of lead Spacey before he finds his place on a local paper. The office is a lot like those newspaper offices that appear in many movies no one ever appears to be doing anything (certainly not writing) and the whole work experience is characters wisecracking and playing in-jokes.(Presumably because the audience always think that copy is produced at the same speed it can be read.)Sadly the setting up of the story and the establishment of various characters leaves little screen time for the melodrama. Indeed it seems more of an add-on than the main thrust of the story. There are things that seem of great importance (rape and incest for example) on the written page that are rather skimmed over. Not that the need viewer information wasn't delivered.Despite being on the box-cover Julianne Moore becomes almost an extra in her own staring movie, playing a role of a damaged-goods person that our hero can readily relate to. My question about her is whether see is good enough to actually carry a movie or whether she is suited to supporting roles. I think a stopwatch reading of her screen-time would give you Hallstrom's opinion!Any reviewer has to be careful not giving away too much of the plot because there isn't much to it and when it isn't delivered as a surprise the movie is devalued. There is drama - it isn't just a lot of furrowed brows - but the thrust is about a time and a place. Place and people first, in other words.A more skilled reviewer would run away from saying they liked or disliked this movie, leaving the reader to read between the lines or take what they want from the main body of text. However I can't bring myself to do so.In truth I don't really know. If you are in the right frame of mind and enjoy good acting this is an enjoyable film, but while it seems (on paper) to cover a lot of ground it is actually only a very limited viewing experience. It never bursts in to full flame, but then again, I don't think the producers ever intended it to.The film ends with the same whimsy as it begins After murder, incest and child rape we finish with a running newspaper headline gag.

But each new revelation in this film is more and more horrific, and when boiled down, seems a bit silly.Kevin Spacey stars as Quoyle, a dumb guy who has a bad family life and is stuck in a dead end job. He is married to a cheap tramp of a woman (Cate Blanchett) and the only good thing in his life is his beautiful little daughter. Let me stop right here for a moment. Kevin Spacey is a very good actor, but its difficult to buy him as a dumb guy. He's the type of guy who, when you walk into a room, you can immediately sense he is the smartest guy in it. Throughout the film, I kept waiting for him to drop that character and reveal he was only playing dumb to fool people. This is the exact opposite of Keanu Reeves. Keanu is at his best as a dumb guy, but is totally unbelievable when given roles where he's supposed to be some big brain.Now to the plot spoilers. Stop here if you intend to see the movie and don't want to have it ruined by a smart Aleck piece of hosiery, sexy though he may be.The horrible revelations start when Spacey's mean spirited father kills himself and his wife. While Spacey is at the funeral, Blanchett decides to take off with her latest boyfriend and sell their daughter into white slavery. Don't worry, I shall wait while you read that last sentence again. Ready? Okay, let's keep going. She gets $6,000 for the girl. However, the same day Blanchett and the boyfriend drive off a bridge and drown, ruining a very nice convertible. This is all very sad for Kevin, who loved her despite her infidelity and loathing for him.A crusty old aunt that he's apparently never met before (played by Judi Dench) shows up and steals his father's ashes. However she takes pity on poor Kevin, and encourages him to leave the city and return to their family roots in Newfoundland, where she pees on the father's ashes in an outhouse.They move into the crumbling old family home right on the Atlantic and Kevin gets hired by Scott Glen at the local newspaper, not doing the mind-dulling typesetting he is used to, but reporting on accidents and the local shipping news. He meets the lovely Julianne Moore, (who apparently was deported due to her performance in Evolution) who is conveniently a widow with a small boy.Along the way, he discovers his ancestors were pirates (!) who moved the lighthouse signals (fire signals to guide ships away from danger) so merchant ships would crash into the nearby rocks and loot their ships; his aunt was raped by her brother (his father) at age 12 and had a baby with him; Quoyle discovers a headless corpse floating in the ocean which leads to his being lost at sea. He survives the bone chillingly cold North Atlantic water by using a cooler as a flotation device. When he is eventually rescued, it is not only revealed the missing head of the man was in the cooler, but the man was someone he interviewed who recently passed through town...on Hitler's yacht!!!! This is kind of like watching two years worth of soap opera all rolled into one movie, or a pretty good SCTV sketch. We eventually discover Julianne Moore lies about being a widow...the man they are having a wake for isn't really dead ...And at a going away party for one of the newspaper men, who has rebuilt an old Chinese junk his friends get drunk, grab axes and power saws and destroy the boat for no particular reason.As outrageous as this all sounds (and is), the acting is all done very well, the scenery is beautiful, and the picture moves along at a crisp pace. If you aren't paying much attention, one might even think one has watched a good movie. But one would be fooling oneself. Boil it all down and you have Kevin Spacey as a dumb guy (yes, I know, a lost and broken man trying to resurrect himself, yes, yes, yes) getting involved in one incredulous and outrageous situation after another. Not a good movie. Yet, I have to admit...I was entertained. I mean, come on, a severed head in a floating cooler from a guy off Hitler's yacht! Who writes this stuff?

The casting includes Julianne Moore, who perfected the Newfoundland accent, as a native resident and widow with a small child. Julianne and Kevin have chemistry. In fact, Kevin also becomes part of the community by working on the paper.

The setting overshadows all else-it is forbidding and unforgiving, gray and cold, just as I remember it. The hero's house is anchored by cable to the ground, so violent can the weather be.  Weather and setting are fine examples of T.S. Eliot's objective correlative serving as touchstone for the lonely but rooted characters themselves.Kevin Spacey plays a more passive and softer Quoyle than novelist Annie Proulx created in her Pulitizer-prize novel.  But this is a movie, not a novel, so I will judge it on its own terms. Spacey's Quoyle gradually grows into assertiveness as a local writer for the eponymous newspaper.   His love interest Wavy (Julianne Moore) has told him he always backs away, so he tries to win her and overcome a family history of sordid buccaneers and murderers. His Aunt Agnis (Judy Dench)  fights the incest demon with patience and strength.Lasse Hallstrom also directed `Cider House Rules' with equal attention to sentimentality but much stronger characters than in `News.'  In `Cider House' I felt sympathy for Homer and Dr. Larch; in `Shipping News' I feel only Qouyle and Wavy's loneliness, no sympathy. In `Cider House' incest is a formidable theme; in `Shipping News' it is like the landscape-dark and always there.Newfoundland just won't give us its news gracefully.

It isn't terrible but it's not far off it. Lasse Hallstrom is the man at the helm which might give you some indication of the way things are going to turn out. After all, the was the man behind The Cider House Rules and Chocolat, two other literary adaptations which failed miserably. Like Richard Brooks before him, Hallstrom seems to be the director of choice when it comes to turning popular literary works into cumbersome motion pictures and like Richard Brooks before him, he has a tendency for over-egging the pudding. But then it could be said that Proulx' novel was one pudding that wasn't short of eggs in the first place which was one reason I always thought Proulx' work was unfilmable, particularly Brokeback Mountain, until Ang Lee came along and proved me wrong. Maybe The Shipping News really needed an Ang Lee.It also needed a different cast. Seldom have I seen a movie more miscast than this one. Never mind that Kevin Spacey bears no resemblance to the character in the book but his 'transformation', in cinematic terms, has no basis in truth. If ever an actor was wrong for a part, it's Spacey; it really is a terrible performance. The rest of the cast follow suit, all but one. As the woman who 'redeems' Spacey, Julianne Moore isn't just the best thing in the picture, she's the only character you can believe in. In fact, she is far too good for the movie.Visually it is impressive, (for a director so bent on literary preoccupations, Hallstrom does have a very keen eye), and there is a fine use of locations. It's also never boring, (big, bad movies seldom are). It's just a mess with very few redeeming features.

When his parents pass away and Petal follows shortly after, his aunt Agnis (Judi Dench) arrives just in time and the two of them along with Quoyle's daughter Bunny move up to Newfoundland where his family came from. The film tries to throw in a lot of supernatural events (the house 'speaks' to the daughter) and a lot of it feels just too contrived and that's where I start to fall off the rails. The performances, for the most part, are great. Spacey gives one of the best performances of the year and in his eyes you can see the internal suffering that Quoyle has faced since he was a boy. As for the supporting cast, Pete Postlethwaite, Gordon Pinsent, Rhys Ifans and the previously mentioned Blanchett all knock their parts out of the park.

Similarly, the characteristics that make Quoyle so appealing, his inner compass and clumsy tortoise-like persistence, are also lost in the rewrite.I think what we have here is an attempt to make another English Patient or Chocolat where the European elements of the plot were watered down to suit the perceived tastes of a North American audience.

I suspect the story has been considerably altered (or else my memory is pretty faded) but I do remember the remote beautiful harsh country and the tough denizens of the Newfoundland coast  &#150; at least the ambiance has been successfully carried over from Annie Proulx's quietly hypnotic novel.Lasse Hallstrom may have made a mess of magic realism in `Chocolat' but this time he sticks to romantic realism and does justice to the book. He gets another strong performance from Judi Dench as the aunt who whisks Quoyle away from his futile existence in picturesque but dull Ploughskeepsie, NY, back to his roots in Newfoundland. He does well with the minor characters who rise well above the yokels from central casting level. As Quoyle's winsome daughter who at times shows character traits worryingly similar to her late monstrous mother Pearl, Hallstrom manages to cast triplets (surely the movie child labour laws aren't that tough). Cate Blanchett puts in a great cameo as Pearl, the good time gal with the heart of lead (she certainly has the body for the part).And then there's Quoyle himself, played by Kevin Spacey. He is said by some to be too urbane, smooth and slim for the part, but he has the hesitancy, the air of defeat, the passivity of the man to whom life has just happened. He also is able to convince us that the change of scene has at least improved his attitude to life. Even if he is still the perennial duffer, the healing process has set in.As Quoyle's romantic interest, the `widow' Prowse, Julianne Moore nicely underplays the role despite occasionally veering from the sub-Irish Newfoundland accent to somewhere in the American South. The scenes with her little backward son (best portrayal in the film, I thought) are just delightful. I don't know much about Newfoundland (though I once stopped over at Goose Bay, Labrador, in the middle of the night) so I can't really say how authentic the portrayal is of village life. But I must say that it did seem unlikely that a group of Newfie fisher folk would, even in a drunken frenzy, destroy a carefully restored boat to prevent a popular new arrival (a public school pom) leaving, though the victim does provide a plausible explanation.  It was easier to understand why Quoyle might have been disturbed by his discovery of his family's dark past. If he had viewed himself as a success in life, he could have taken pride in it, like those Sydneysiders with a convict background (now pretty remote &#150; the last convicts arrived in the 1840s). Instead, mired in failure, he sees himself as shackled to the past. Yet it is in the place where all the bad things happened that he gains redemption. Anyway, there's no such thing as an evil place; we carry goodness and evil around with us, just as the old Quoyles manhauled their house across the ice (an unforgettable image). And the Newfoundland Coast is not lacking in wild beauty.

The problem is we don't connect with Quoyle's soap opera-ish problems enough to actually care about him. The E.

Not in the least. Basically, this film is about a man named Quoyle (does he even have a first name? Does anyone care?), who after marrying a hooker named Petal (in nothing more than a glorified cameo for Cate Blanchett), who sold his daughter (she's a piece of work herself) to the black-market (!!!) and was killed in a car accident, journeys to Newfoundland at the advice of an aunt named Agnes (played by Judi Dench, who really should know better than this) and gets a job writing articles on boats for this local newspaper company. So, what did I hate about this film?1) The characters First of all, Quoyle is an idiot. He falls in love with some random floozy, has the intelligence of a doorknob, doesn't seem to care that his wife brought home random men every night, and has the charisma of a Lima bean. When Quoyle's boat overturned halfway for the movie, I was rooting for the sea to drown him. Petal is also an idiot, just for different reasons. I mean, why in the HELL would you sell your daughter? That is just the most stupid thing I've ever seen.2) The acting Now, it's not enough that Spacey recites every line like he's on sleep mode, but seriously, how hard could it be to get Julianne Moore to do a passable Newfoundland accent? She sounds like she's from New Jersey or something. On top of that, she has no chemistry with Spacey. The two of them performing their scenes feels forced and shallow. However, the rest of the cast did a competent job (especially Scott Glenn and Pete Posthelwaite, who I believe can do no wrong).3) The plot Here's where we get to the meat and potatoes. These are all the things that me cringe at this film...in no particular order Quoyle practically drowning as a child and his father doesn't even care; Quoyle telling a woman he's only met for ten minutes that he loves her; Petal shoving a donut in Quoyle's mouth after they have sex; Quoyle sitting passively while Petal has sex with some random biker dude; Petal selling her daughter into the black market and then getting killed; Quoyle having visions of things he never even saw (Petal's death); Agnes stealing Guy's ashes, then urinating on them in an outhouse; the fact that almost every person in Newfoundland is depicted as shallow, backstabbing, ignorant individuals (and I have visited Newfoundland, so I will tell you this is NOT the case by any means); the fact that Bunny can see ghosts, feel what an inanimate object is feeling, and has prophetic visions of thing happening; the fact that Quoyle's ancestors were pillaging pirates who dragged their own house across a lake....and that no one bothered to tell Quoyle; the fact that Agnes got raped by her own brother, had an abortion, and then decided to become a lesbian (makes sense to me); the fact that random Newfoundlanders destroyed a boat that a guy who came from Shanghai had finished; squid hamburgers; and the fact that no one bothered to check the dead guy who ran the newspaper company (have these people ever heard of checking for VITAL SIGNS???) before they decided to hold a wake for him.Bottom Line This film is pure, unadulterated pap. No question about it. It sickens me how so many accomplished actors were assembled for this film, and how little they all accomplished. Avoid it at all costs.

It is probably unfair to blame Spacey and Moore for the shallow and inconsistent performance, since there were fundamental flaws in the way that the characters were developed throughout the entire film. The use of voice-over is a mistake from my point of view. There is no doubt that Spacey is extremely good at narrating (American Beauty was probably the best example), but the overuse of voice-over in this movie compromised the audience's experience with the character's subtle process of awakening and recovery, as well as the impact of Spacey's acting. In a word, it would be better to let the actions of the character to speak.In general, Spacey's performance in this movie was mixed. Sometimes he was very masterful, while sometimes he seemed to be at loss. The character of Wavey was essentially a failure. Moore was very much like a New Yorker holiday visiting the island instead of a native Newfoundlander. However, both Cate Blanchett and Judi Dench perfected their parts, which made the movie not entirely disappointing. Other characters, such as Card, Bunny, were either too caricatured or too witch like to be convincing. It should be mentioned that the cinematography was excellent.

Miss Dench is very much the grande dame condescending to give the colonials a lesson in acting with an 'A' Now apparently comfortably ensconced as a ludicrously politically correct M in the Bond franchise she can presumably afford to cherry - pick her roles,a luxury she has not been able to afford in the past.Here she proclaims and emotes like an ageing RSC understudy for Lady Macbeth.

Spacey and Moore give uninspired, lifeless performances; which is a shame considering how brilliant these two can be when they put their minds to it. Spacey's character was supposed to be defeated, but the portrayal comes across as more comatose than defeated.

I like these clusters because, while they may be all different sizes, they are consistent with the rest of the cereal. These clusters do not stand out, or work as a solo meal, but instead work with the rest of the bowl to give me an overall great breakfast experience. If a person were to ask me about a way that The Shipping News could have been a better film, I believe I would have answered with the Honey Bunches of Oats analogy above. This film was full of nothing but character clusters that unfortunately could not work with the rest of the film. We had cluster after cluster of events taking place, raging from childhood rape to a wife's decision to spread false information all the way to a false autopsy (hopefully not giving too much away), but instead of making this a powerful film about human suffering, we are left with an unforgivable amount of lacking substance with each character, thus creating a horrid film which leaves you nothing to fully sink you teeth into.Director Lasse Hallström has directed some great films like Cider House Rules as well as Chocolat, but The Shipping News will not be as successful as these films because of Hallström's lack of grip on the main subjects. He begins this film by focusing intently on Quoyle (Spacey) painting us a bold and vivid portrait of his past and leering present, but once we get this story in motion, Hallström quickens his pace and drops Quoyle to the backburner as we attempt to create a town of mishaps. Everyone is depressed, everyone has seen harder days, and everyone is jaded in this film because Hallström wants to demonstrate a village that sees the same problems that Quoyle does. For me, this didn't work. Instead of making the film as depressing as the scenery, perhaps he could have created a town a bit more realistic (maybe a bit more Capra-esquire &#150; although I didn't like it in Darabont's Majestic) which would allow the minimal characters to shine without the need to bring darkness into every story. What could have made this film stand out would be the smaller, more supportive character being funny, cute, or even a bit optimistic. Early in the film I accepted Quoyle for was who he was due to his life struggles, but I needed Hallström to give me a strong juxtaposition between where Quoyle was in Poughkeepsie to where he moved to in Newfoundland. With the strength of the secondary characters, we could have seen a stronger transition for Quoyle in this new, yet familiar, home. The fact that everyone in town harbored some dark, nearly horrific story just felt cheap because we, as an audience, were forced to spread our sympathies thin, not sure whom to give it the strongest attention. In my eyes, the biggest error in Hallström's adaptation was the lack of the environment, both living as well as scenic, surrounded Quoyle.Typically Hallström has the ability to pull great work out of even the least favorite actor, but alas, with this film it felt like everyone was just trying to stay warm so they swooped through their lines devoid of anything worth mentioning. Spacey doldrums his way through his character Quoyle, giving us yet another Pay It Forward spineless performance. Ebert said that Spacey plays smart characters well, and I couldn't agree with him more. It just seems like lately Spacey has been afraid of those types and opts to rather play soft troubled characters where he never has to raise his voice. Julianne Moore was forgetful in this film. She has one type of character that she plays, and whether you watch this movie or Evolution or Magnolia, you typically see the same character just with a different name. While I have enjoyed some of her performances in the past, it seems as if as I watch her going forward, she seems to blend everything together. Her performance in this film reminded me of her performance in The Forgotten, but with a different accent. Dame Judi Dench only plays roles like this one, so it should be no surprise that she chose to participate in this film. Her character is confusing, which leads me to believe that Hallström didn't know quite to do with the power that Dench had to offer. The only actor that I believed did something spectacular in this film was Cate Blanchett. Her few moments on screen as Petal, also as the main catalyst for Quoyle, was breathtakingly refreshing. She was smart, sharp, and passionately not herself, who made for a character this critic wishes we saw more of during this sloppy film. Again, the clusters of characters in this film were never working together to defeat a common purpose, but merely being themselves, giving us no energy, and providing us with a film severely lacking in all core elements of cinema.Overall, The Shipping News was a bust for Spacey fans, it was a bust for Hallström fans, and it was a bust for E. Annie Proulx's fans. I will always be the first to say that it is difficult work to recreate the inner-human from the written page, because a director could never physically put a character/actor in a place where the characters within the book are, it is mentally and physically impossible. If you are looking for a book that would accompany this film just as well, check out Iain Banks' The Wasp Factory. It is one of those books that could never translate well into a film, but is just as depressing as this film is!

It isn't as well known, but even the Roman public began to be disgusted by what they saw there.And this is what demoralizes me about such films as Shipping News. I don't think a single depraved act of barbaric cruelty was left out. There was a crucifixion/mutilation scene, an incest rape scene, gang rape and murder, a rising from the dead(?) etc. The sickening disturbing scenes continued on like the continual ringing of a phone, until the hapless viewer who made the horrible mistake of paying money to witness this egregious literary failure, became ever more nauseous with each passing scene/nightmare scenario...literally, nightmares were included as synoptic vignettes of the horror that went on just moments before!One scene in particular was particularly gratuitous hogwash. This was the scene where an outsider to Newfoundland had landed there by mistake, as most had, it would seem, and had spent years accumulating small amounts of rare materials through endless, tedium and low pay- in order to rebuild his boat, and leave that God forsaken rock and ice hell hole. So this fellow throws a farewell party for the town folk; who proceed to get puking drunk, and in a fit of idiocy, hack and chop and burn the fellow's years of work on his boat to smoldering ruin. At first light of dawn, a few remaining drunks toast along with the outsider's glib resignation to it all...to some inchoate future misadventure.What is all of this about? Was this the female author's anti-male ax to grind? Did it make her feel better to firmly establish in our minds what brutish, drunken, raping, torturing, pillaging, abandoning, useless, irresponsible and reprehensible men are?Let's see..did we leave out any loutish male behaviour....oh yes....our dumb ass Kevin Spacey stumbles over to the pale, mumbling, Olive Oyl sex object/love interest, coming home a drinkin' with lovin' on his mind, and makes a pathetic, awkward attempt at an embrace, which gives our poor victim/heroine the opportunity to shove the lout to the floor in emasculated shame...which is but only one of a number of emasculating rebukes by the sorry excuse for an woman/romantic interest. ( Barf )This movie is not just sickening, disgusting and repulsive...it is puerile, insipid literary trash.Did these fine actors and actresses read the script...and still they went for it? This proves that you can possess consummate skills, yet still be the dimmest bulb in the pack. Even Roman Citizens were sickened by this sordid swill. But it was too late...the Huns were at the border by then. And we all know what happened after that. What the people of Newfoundland ought to do is sue the people who did this to them. Now no one in their right mind would visit a nightmarish hell hole like Newfoundland ( I'm sure it is a lovely place...but not in the hands of these cinematic Neanderthals ) "},{"Title":"Dialect Coach","Date":"2 April 2012","Score":"0 out of 6 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama","Review":" Every actor and/or actress has at least one movie he/she wishes they could obliterate from their careers.
