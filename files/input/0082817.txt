He isn't Rambo or Rocky...just a tough New York City cop.Stallone and partner Billy Dee Williams team up in an attempt to stop a terrifying international terrorist (Rutger Hauer) before he kills more people. All three of those actors are riveting in this rough, gritty film.I thought so much of this movie that I bought it twice. The first DVD that came out was fullscreen, no stereo and grainy. Later, they issued a better widescreen print and it was worth upgrading. The movie is a top-notch thriller start-to-finish and Hauer makes an outstanding villain.It might be a clich√© but this film always kept m on the edge of my seat.

Stallone had not become a parody of himself yet and his diction is better here than it had ever been up to then. The movie's pace is unrelenting. This is a movie that I almost always have to stop and watch, easily getting swiped up into the story again and again, when I see it on television. Excellent twist ending and monorail scene.

No. Hmmmm. Hauer is one of my favorite actors and stars in two of my top ten favorite movies (Blade Runner and The Osterman Weekend), so it's hard not to already be slightly biased about the movie. I remember first hearing about Nighthawks on the Headliners and Legends biography of Stallone and how it was not as well received as his Rocky and First Blood movies. For shame, because Nighthawks does manage to be a top notch thriller most of the time. I could go into the plot, but I believe in telling people what I liked and disliked instead of parroting the plot details like almost every other review. (See, a movie to me is more fun when I only know a little about the story, instead of the first hour or so, because someone felt that they had to readers digest the entire film.)Anyway, now that I've ranted, I have to admit that I enjoyed it for the most part, with the exception of the initial pacing. It continues to drag in places towards the middle, and takes a little over an hour to set up the crucial players backgrounds. The only real problem is that every time the film stops to focus on DeSilva (Stallone) and Fox (Williams), it spends twice as much time focusing on Wulfgar. Wulfgar is certainly a well crafted maniac, but when the movie is over we know almost nothing about Fox and only a little about Dee DeSilva. Still, the movie does succeed in making you care about our two main characters, by thrusting them into danger and having them do what is morally right (i.e. Towards the beginning of the film the two are in a drug raid, and refuse to take bribes from the perps who had apparently already paid off the cops from the first raid on their operation.They're good cops, and it's their good guy image that endears them). I guess it would have been nice also to see a little more of Stallones relation to what's her name. (sorry, I haven't seen this in a about a month now.) I was interested in the prospect of a hero who was torn between the relation with his ex (who he was trying to re-ignite the flame with), and his duty. But, alas, she was just a narrative device who the writers have decided is only important in the last 15 minutes or so.With all these cons, why did I still like it? Sudden scenes of high impact, good cast and acting all around, a villain who wasn't just a cardboard cutout, and Stallone's bitchin' beard, and a wholly convincing scenario.The bottom line This film is more akin to The French Connection than it is to Rocky. Methodical and often stylish, NightHawks deserves to at least be rented and watched with an open mind.8 Stars out of 10  "},{"Title":"One of the most underrated films...","Date":"19 May 2000","Score":"17 out of 24 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Crime, Thriller","Review":"  This is one of the best action movies out there, even to this day.

Sylvester Stallone and Billy Dee Williams are decoy cops -- that is, they venture into rough neighborhoods to bait muggers and other forms of scum -- assigned to track down the cold and calculating Rutger Hauer. It seems the devious mastermind has landed in the media capital of the world, New York City, to try and regain his place among the terrorist elite.Although it's a fairly decent action/suspense effort, NIGHTHAWKS is difficult to recommend unconditionally. The performances are certainly solid; in fact, it's hard to remember Stallone, here sporting a thin beard, being so effective outside of boxing trunks. The action is crisp and exhilarating, with one pursuit through subterranean New York deserving of a place in the Chase Hall of Fame. The story is original and much of the plot intriguing. And Hauer, in his American film debut, is a suitably hateful villain, with his motives all to familiar to contemporary audiences.Yet NIGHTHAWKS is not quite as good as the sum of its parts. Even though the film starts out with a bang -- literally -- there's somehow too much build-up and not enough execution. The movie has not aged particularly well, and despite its 1981 release date has the feel of a '70s period piece. And as good as Hauer is, his character is a little too incredible to believe as he pulls off massive acts of terror with little or no sponsorship; what should take a team of experts is accomplished by one man wanted by countless law enforcement agencies.In the end, NIGHTHAWKS is a movie you're bound to like -- either a little bit or a lot. Considering the high ratio of garbage that has and will continue to spew out of Hollywood, I guess that's not such a bad thing.

Though he's totally unrecognizable with a long beard, Stallone does an exceptionally good performance because unlike his other cop roles, such as Ray Tango from Tango and Cash, Sly doesn't portray a cocky character, which makes it very realistic. However, our hero doesn't show his muscles in this flick, but, it proves that you don't have to be brawny to be a tough guy.Hauer is also perfect, playing what he does best, an oily villian. He might look very suave at first in this film, but when he shows his true colors, you better watch out. Last but not least is Billy Dee Williams, who does a cool Roger Murtaughesque cop who relies on his partner Sly to do the job.If you're in the mood for suspense and good chase scenes, Nighthawks is your gameplan.

Initionally the movie seems like a cool, simple, typical '80's action flick, with some well known actors in it. However as the movie progresses the pace is gone and the movie gets filled with underdeveloped plot lines and characters. Luckily the movie re-finds its pace toward the ending, which helps to make this movie still a watchable and good one, for the genre-fans.I think that the main problem with this movie is that its too short. Because of this nothing in the movie really fully gets developed, such as Sylvester Stallone's character's relationship with his ex-wife or who exactly was Peter Hartman, who seemed like a good and interesting enough character but unfortunately was highly underused and developed in the movie. He walked around without a real purpose despite the fact that he could had been a so much more relevant and interesting character for the movie and its story. Also they could had made the whole hunt of DaSilva (Sylvester Stallone) on Wulfgar (Rutger Hauer) so much more exciting, tense and spectacular. An hunter who hunts a hunter. Instead now their hate toward each other feels unfounded and perhaps even silly and unlikely at certain moments.Yet the tree main characters of the movie are still quite good. The two cops played by Sylvester Stallone and Billy Dee Williams form a nice and credible duo and Rutger Hauer perfectly plays a villainous cold-hearted terrorist. Hollywood needs more villain actors like him, it would make so many movies so much better. Its definitely true that the presence of this tree fine actors uplift the movie and help to make this a still slightly above average one.The whole plot line of a ruthless, professional terrorist causing mayhem in New York is quite original (at least for its period) and works refreshing and help to make this movie quite an original action-flick, although his motivations still remain a bit in the dark and shaky to find it all credible enough.But of course the movie works well enough as mindless entertainment, though it perhaps could had used some more and bigger action sequences.The movie has '80's written all over it. Movies from the '80's don't have the greatest visual style and also mostly always have some horrible '80's music. This movie is unfortunately no exception on this all.All in all its not a bad action flick and it will most likely please the genre-fans, also thanks to the presence of '80's action icon Sylverst Stallone and villain expert actor Rutger Hauer.6/10http//bobafett1138.blogspot.com/ "},{"Title":"I do not enjoy killing...But it's my JOB !","Date":"19 September 2005","Score":"8 out of 14 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Crime, Thriller","Review":" One of the most underrated movies of the eighties. I couldn't figure out why this was so dissed by the critics and the public in the early eighties. Was it because people were not ready to embrace the thought of international terrorism in their front yard? I think so.This is one of Sylvester Stallone's forgotten movies where he reminds you of Al Pacino as Serpico at times with his benevolent nature and the facial hair. He doesn't slur his monosyllabic sentences, or act as if he has lost more IQ points. Until this film came out, I didn't think there was much more to Stallone. Sadly, I was too young to see this all by myself in the theatres and saw it a year later on cable. And when I saw Rutger Hauer, I was amazed at how creepy the man was! He was born for the role, but unfortunately, Hauer doesn't seem to play good guys as well. Whenever I see him, this is the first film I think of. Blade Runner's the second. Billy Dee Williams's character was bland that I didn't find myself rooting for nor hating him. Lindsay Wagner is expendable and I wish the late Persis Khambatta was able to stretch her role a little more. She was Hauer's perfect, plausible counterpart (and spoke some wicked French and German). Nigel Davenport is the typical foreign expert on the subject that gives the film an interesting transatlantic angle.I found myself bored by the end of the first forty-five minutes, until the montage of Stallone and Williams looking for clues to the dead flight attendant at the various discoteques. And then when this movie came on TV, they changed the two songs in the disco Brown Sugar from the Stones and I'm a Man from Keith Emerson to seventies stock tunes. Must of been a lawsuit pending. Suffice the music, there is a brutal, ten-minute-long chase through subway tunnels, a station, and then on the train itself. Afterwards, there's some downtime, but Wulfgar (Hauer) is at the point of no return now that the po-po has a physical description of him. So much for the plastic surgery. You can now sense the desperation he has, and he already knows he's not going to get a happy ending so that's why he decides to air-out Stallone's ex-wife (played by Wagner in two or three brief snippets). So you know that he's gonna lose, it's just HOW he is going to lose makes you watch the rest of it. You can also see that Stallone's character struggles with himself on how he'd rather bring Wulfgar in than kill the terrorist (he's got those law-enforcing ideology and beliefs going on overtime).But the problem about this film is that it is so dated and by-the-numbers judging from today's standards, that it's almost a flat-out documentary. The formula is typical seventies where the exposition is gradually set up until the middle of the film- and by then the viewer is bored- but the action and suspense takes place throughout the rest (you'll notice from the Dirty Harry, Rocky, and Star Wars movies, the later Indiana Jones flicks, along with Serpico, The French Connection, etc). However, Nighthawks was clearly ahead of its time, and I could see a remake or something like this being done down the road from now. See, NOW it might sell because we've seen it in our own front yard. Get Vin Diesel to play Stallone's role; Tyrese Gibson to play Billy Dee Williams; Lindsay Wagner's character's axed; Cillian Murphy will be Rutger Hauer; Clive Owen can play Nigel Davenport's role; Milla Jovovich can be Shakka, and Michael Clarke Duncan will play their Lieutenant.But leave in the I do not enjoy killing, but it's my job-line.Still good for its time !

But DaSilva's at-home tactics are very much put to the challenge , as he is assigned to special unit led by the British Peter Hartman (Nigel Davenport) that's tracking a psychopath as well as wily killer .The film is combined of unstopped action ,shootouts , violence , fighting , adequate characterization and breathtakingly suspenseful denouement .It's a run-of-the-mill action movie because from start with its explosive first scene to finish the action packed is continued ,in fact ,the final confrontation is impressive and extremely violent , including plot twists . Prior to it's theatrical release, Nighthawks was severely cut for violence by both Universal studio and MPAA. Amongst the scenes that were cut are disco shootout which originally had Wufgar shooting and killing more people, and Wufgar's death scene in the ending which was almost completely cut out . Amongst the scenes which were deleted from original cut of the movie are almost all scenes between Sylvester Stallone and Lindsey Wagner, Rutger Hauer and Persis Khambatta, more scenes explaining the plot better, and many other scenes because Universal wanted fast paced action movie . They also cut most of the graphic and gory scenes due to the concern that movie will get X rating . In preparation for their roles as New York street cops, actors Billy Dee Williams and Sylvester Stallone spent a number of weeks working at night with the New York Street Crime Unit . Nice acting by Sylvester Stallone as conservative street cop DaSilva reluctantly agrees to terminate an international terrorist who has demanded media attention , but is Rutger Hauer who steals the show as a cruel terrorist . The film is from Sylvester's first period after his secondary interpretations in Mandingo , Bananas , Farewell my lovely , Capone, Death race 2000 , and during his successful Rocky I , II , Paradise alley and Fist acting. This supercharged action motion picture was well directed by Bruce Malmuth , including hair-raising moments along the way . When the original director, Gary Nelson, left the project, Bruce Malmuth took over production. When he couldn't make it on his first day to shoot the train chase, Sylvester Stallone directed the chase himself to not miss a day of shooting. Malmuth made his film directorial debut with Sylvester Stallone in this classic thriller Nighthawks (1981), followed by Mary Higgins Clark's best seller, Where Are the Children? (1986) with Jill Clayburgh, and the popular action film dealing with political corruption, Hard to kill (1990) with Steven Seagal and Pentathlon (1994) with Dolph Lundgren, as well a number of other feature films and documentaries until his early death.

He is heading to America, and he is being met by the challenge of two good guy cops. Sylvester Stallone play's a somewhat clich√©d, out of control Sergeant called Deke DaSilva, with a typically cooler minded sidekick, Matthew Fox, played by the often excellent Billy Dee Williams. We see gun fights, chases, and the heat and tension sure builds up in the way that good action movies do, but that's the problem with 'Nighthawks', it should not just be a simple action film. If Stallone hadn't been allowed to be so hands on in this movie, we could have perhaps had some scene's explaining 'Wolfgars' past, what drove him to badly hurt and murder people, as it is, his back story is left somewhat ambiguous, and as a result, we have no other character's to be interested in other than Stallones. Quite frankly, discovering why a terrorist travels the globe to kill for a cause he believes so strongly in, is a much more interesting proposition than watching Sergeant DaSilva argue with his wife about never having time for her, and if Stallone had the gut's to really make a serious movie about terrorist's, then 'Nighthawks' could've been a much better movies than the one we got. I feel sorry for Rutger Hauer here, he could really have brought something fantastic to his role had his back story permitted it.

The script is fairly gritty & tough, the action set-pieces although smaller in scale than some action films are believable& have a certain intensity. The character's are alright, while the film starts off with a fair bit of character development it soon goes out of the window once the chase between DaSilva & Wulfghar gets going & there are a few points that could have been explained better or elaborated on. It's never made clear why Wulfgar is in New York or how he got there or even the purpose behind his latest act of terrorism, there's something about wanting press coverage but that sounds rather flimsy motivation to me. Made during a time when maybe terrorism wasn't in the headlines as much as it is now the character of Wolfgar has this speech about being a liberator in order to justify his actions, on the other hand all the innocent people he kills or puts in danger leaves his excuses as meaningless rubbish. At almost an hour & forty minutes long Nighthawks takes a while to get going but it uses it's duration to build the tension & the situation up so once it does kick off it has an impact.The title Nighthawks apparently refers to the cops of New York who patrol at night, the working titles Attack & Hawks were both used during production. The action scenes are good, from shoot-outs to a subway chase through a speeding train to a cable car hostage situation to a runaway bus (although there's no explanation of how Wolfgar survived the crash). Nighthawks is the type of film you couldn't make today, New York just doesn't look like this anymore, from the grimy dirt filled streets to the graffiti strewn walls to the general sleaziness of the locations used. Nighthawks has a gritty & tough visual appearance. The original story was apparently planned originally as The French Connection III but Gene Hackman didn't want to do a third film & the script was then tweaked & turned into Nighthawks.With a supposed budget of about $5,000,000 this has that gritty early 80's look about it that I liked so much, filmed in New York, London & Paris. The acting is alright, Nighthawks was the first time Stallone played a cop in a film & gets to dress in drag no less than twice. Billy Dee Williams is OK as his partner while Nigel Davenport doesn't have a lot to do. Rutger Hauer does OK as the bad guy, the Dutch born actor is playing a German with a very strange accent.Nighthawks is a tough action thriller with some good action scenes & an early appearance by Sylvester Stallone in one of his forgotten films.

It focuses on two undercover police detectives, Sgt. Deke DaSilva(SYLVESTER STALLONE) and his partner Sgt. Matthew Fox(BILLY DEE WILLIAMS)who work in the NYPD Citywide Street Crime Unit as decoy officers. Donning different disguises, they walk the streets of the City's toughest neighborhoods, offering themselves up as bait for muggers and other lowlifes. This unit was responsible for taking a lot of guns and dangerous people off the streets. Unfortunately, in the wake of the Amadou Diallo shooting in the Bronx in 1999, it was disbanded.The arrival in New York of an international terrorist named Wulfgar(RUTGER HAUER) finds the two Detectives temporarily reassigned to an elite counter-terrorist unit called ATAC. A British expert on counterterrorism in general and Wulfgar in particular(NIGEL DAVENPORT) is recruited by the Department to train the selectees in the different strategies and tactics they'll need to deal with this new threat. His character, Peter Hartman, is an old hand at understanding the terrorist mentality and how they operate. He is also a believer in taking the shot when the opportunity presents itself, even if it results in collateral damage, or death to a civilian hostage.Stallone's character has a big problem with all this. He indicates that he didn't join the Department to kill people, whether they're street criminals, terrorists, or especially, innocent civilians. Clashing with Hartman at every juncture, he says he doesn't want any part of this and indicates to the Englishman that he's quitting the unit. His partner talks him out of it by telling him that Hartman sees him as one of the best and that's why he was chosen. In reviewing DaSilva's wartime kill record in Vietnam, Hartman tells him that he has faith that when the time comes, he'll do what needs to be done.Wulfgar is very intelligent, cunning and good-looking and his MO is to hook up with women he meets at discos and move in with them, using their apartments as a safe house. When he meets Pam(HILARIE THOMPSON), an airline stewardess, she asks him what he does for a living. Knowing that she won't believe him, he tells her the truth- that he's an international terrorist wanted by the police in various European countries. When she stumbles upon his weapons stash in her closet after he moves in with her, she realizes too late that what he told her was not a jocular remark. When the police find her body they also find a clue that he inadvertently left behind indicating what his strike target here in the City will be. DaSilva and Fox start scouring the discotheques with the woman's photo in hand to try and get a line on whom she might have hooked up with. They hit paydirt when DaSilva spots whom he suspects might be Wulfgar at a disco with his newly altered facial appearance, courtesy of plastic surgery in Europe. DaSilva uses the police trick of staring Wulfgar down to see if he gets hinky and Wulfgar realizes he's been made. A chase into the subway ensues, with Wulfgar taking an elderly woman hostage at knifepoint. DaSilva gets him in his sights but doesn't take the shot out of fear of hitting the hostage. In the ensuing chase, Sgt. Fox is ambushed by Wulfgar, who slices his face open and then makes good his escape. DaSilva, whose button has now been pushed, will no longer harbor any illusions about what he's dealing with. Wulfgar's associate in terrorism is one Shakka Holland, played by the beautiful late Indian actress PERSIS KHAMBATTA. She is so effective in her portrayal of a coldhearted woman who kills without compunction or remorse, that your blood will be chilled when you see her on screen. Without even saying anything, she will terrify you. You will not forget the look on her face. It will definitely haunt your dreams.We all know that the movie is leading up to a climactic confrontation between DaSilva and Wulfgar. And we know when that moment of truth arrives that DaSilva, now effectively disabused of his I'm not here to kill anyone philosophy, will indeed do what needs to be done. I won't reveal the ending here, other than to say that it reflects well on his training and experience in the Street Crime Unit. This is a well-crafted thriller with excellent performances, beautiful photography, and a storyline that will resonate with the viewer on a visceral level. It will keep you hooked from the opening sequence until the end. Yo Adrian- this is my favorite Stallone film. I give it a 10 out of 10.

At first, his over-cautious cop-on-the-beat mentality lands him at odds with the lead investigator who explains that to combat violence, you need greater violence. This is a nice little clash of ideals that allows for a little more character development that you'd expect.The said terrorist is very well-played by Rutger Hauer in a breakthrough role that gives both charm and menace. Also, there is a nice chemistry between Stallone and his partner Billy Dee Williams.The plot development is quite old school in the way there's a very long build up before the action kicks in with a lengthy set-piece that tops the film. But there's plenty of four-letter words, terrorist-talk and machismo flying around to fill that time nicely. The soundtrack may be dated now, but gives the film a unique quality and in fact the music is one of the unforgettable elements of the film - which has led to controversy over the DVD release.There is clearly a lot of footage that was left on the cutting room floor, particularly a love sub-plot that is abandoned quite early on.

In stead we get a Stallone with a beard and HUGE glasses and acting relaxed.A lot of people say Stallone can't act. I disagree, just look at this movie.Stallone plays a street-cop who has to deal with a terrorist played by our national (Dutch) pride Rutger Hauer.This is a great action thriller, with great actors like Rutger Hauer, Billy Dee Williams and Joe Spinell (who also had a big part in Rocky).The action is great, just look at the sequence when Stallone and Williams are trying to catch Rutger Hauer in the subway. Great music also. The end is nice too, bit of a surprise there.****SPOILER****At the end (when Stallone shoots Hauer) the scene is cut. We see him shooting only two times, but the original scene is with 6 shots. So 4 shots were removed (for television).Another fact is that Stallone directed a big part of this movie because the original director quit or was fired.So if you're looking for a good action-thriller with a nice eighties feel and some good acting, look no further.

It's only Stallone 's and Hauer's best performances in any movie that I've seen them in. I read a positive comment (which encouraged me to write this) about this film. I was 9 years old when this movie came out tried to sneak into it when it played in the theaters (failed), saw it a year later on cable, and I LOVED IT! I resembled a little Rutger Hauer and lived in Los Angeles at the time, so I found myself almost relating to this film. But I was so impressed that it wasn't like all of the other dreck that came out that year, too.Now international terrorism is simply a satire in today's films until 9/11. However, I think that Die Hard changed the industry forever in a bad way. To them more is better- to me, more is more. This movie does not glamorize violence (like the before mentioned) and shows how serious it is when it hits home. This movie did not play very long in theaters (in 1981), and hardly anyone can recollect it. It was made on a modest budget, and so many films have surpassed it since, it is now been archived. I wish Stallone returned to this kind of role he's so enamoured with John Rambo, Rocky Balboa, every other action-hero-cardboard role that he lost credibility. Hauer went down a separate but equal path in demonstrating his difficulties with other directors, he's a strait-to-video icon.To this day, I still remember the lines ...I do not enjoy killing-- but it's my job! and ...now this is for the press...Now you may drop the child, but don't drop this...Why can't people watch this instead of Steven Segal movies?

Hot Dutch actor Rutger Hauer made his Hollywood debut as the villain Wulfgar, an elusive terrorist who has come to New York to restore his credibility after a bomb raid on a London department store went wrong. Sly and Billy are two tough cops, DaSilva and Fox, who are transferred to an anti-terrorist unit, headed by Davenport, who gives them the essential combat training to tackle Wulfgar.  Apparently, in one UK movie mag, Stallone cited Nighthawks as one of his best movies and it's not hard to see why. The story nicely builds up from one scene to another, involving individual characters, until the obligatory confrontation between 'good' (Stallone) and 'evil' (Hauer). Some years ago, when this came on TV, guys in my class watched it and told me how boring they thought it was. I'll admit, the first 40 or so minutes are talky and things pick up after the two cops ID Wulfgar in a night club, then give chase. If you are expecting Nighthawks to be an all-action affair in the vein of RAMBO, DEMOLITION MAN or even ASSASSINS, you'll be disappointed, but nevertheless, this is purely a taut thriller flick with memorable scenes such as the disco showdown, the foot chase, the tram hijack, Sly practising at the shooting range ( I saw this bit in an advert years ago on ITV ) and the exciting finale which has definitely been censored in UK VHS and DVD versions. In a way, this was probably Stallone's first proper action movie of the 80s before FIRST BLOOD and he also manages to perfect that famous 'death stare' of his which was never seen on Rocky Balboa.

The chase scene in the subway is thrilling, well shot and engrossing. This film, as far as I am concerned also benefits immeasurably from its New York location. It really could not have been shot anywhere else in the US except maybe Chicago. I am a native New Yorker so I am obviously partial to New York, but after you see enough movies, you arrive at the conclusion that New York is the best place to shoot a film, generally speaking and depending on what kind of film is being made.

Although many films dealing with political terror tend to either make the terrorist/hero character so grotesquely evil/good that they like cartoons (see both Under Siege films, Delta Force or Navy Seals if you want comic book terrorism), or the information relating to terrorism is inaccurate. Director Bruce Malmuth takes information from actual incidents from the 1970s (known in terror circles as Fright Decade #2), a good screenplay, true-to-life characters, and weaves them into a dramatic morality play. In a perfectly cast role, German Rutger Hauer, whose country had it's own war against The Baader-Meihoff Gang/Red Army Faction just a decade before, is at his best as the slick, sinister freelance terrorist Wulfgar, loosely based upon real-life terrorists such as Carlos the Jackel. Persis Khambatta goes evil after Star Trek and goes it well with her portrayal as Hauer's contact, and Nigel Davenport is excellent as the terrorists' European nemesis, Hartman. This, in my opinion, is one of Stallone's best performances. The rest of the cast is in fine form, even adult star Jamie Gillis as Lindsey Wagner's oily boss. Historically factual events give this film a lot of weight. During Davenport's briefings, actual terrorist acts are referenced, such as the Vienna OPEC Raid and the shooting of a policeman at point-blank range. In reality both acts were carried out by The Jackel himself. Slides flashed on the war show actual photos, and techniques used by terrorists are woven into this film. The only downside to this film is the removal of The Rolling Stones' Brown Sugar and Keith Emerson's (Emerson, Lake & Palmer) remake of the Yardbird classic I'm A Man, in favor of something totally unworthy of being put on scotch tape. Emerson's score is a perfect marriage for the visuals in this film, and the removal of I'm a Man from it's place where the hero first IDs the villain is a mistake of the first order. Since Sept. 11, terrorism has been getting a lot of attention. Hollywood will eventually get around to over dramatizing/sentimentalizing it, but even after 20 years, this film stands some pretty harsh examinations. If you're interested in good movies about terrorism, you can't do much better than this.

It aims to be good entertainment and not much else, and succeeds commendably. Besides a bit too much stress on how great Stallone's character is at the beginning of the film the film flows rather nicely. There is a terrorist, who is a very bad man, which will do anything just to prove himself to everyone else. And there is a cop who likes to do his job clean. But with terrorism it doesn't always work that way, and that is the films meaningful angle. Although it seems like the director realized that entertainment was number one, and nothing should get in its way, therefore the film never stops to ponder too much over the police/baddie similarities, and usually after brief atmospheric tense character scenes it goes back to the action.The action takes most of the film up, although it's not overdone too much, sometimes you do wonder if they could have run around for a bit less time. The script is the only thing that lets this down, with some of the events being a bit dubious. You do get the feeling from time to time that the scriptwriter wasn't quite sure how to chain some events so they seem a bit forced. But other ideas are kind of cute to make up for it.Although it is full of cliches, this is not really a downside to the film, which seems to be shouting out that cliches aren't that bad. And being from the early eighties you could always argue that it was actually laying the ground for cliches to become such.Acting is good, even from Sly, this really is the role he was born to play. He is the Rocky of the NY street undercover police. Hauer rocks in no small way, and Nigel Davenport shouts like no one (you'll see what I mean).Watch and enjoy. That's all folks.

That said, the year - 1981 - is a give-away that this is a Stallone movie before he went mainstream. One of the first five movies he did after Rocky, just contrast his minimal, taciturn performance here as DaSilva with the all-action, all wise cracking cop five years later in Cobra.That's not to say Nighthawks is an art movie, but it is strikingly directed, particularly the scenes set in the Bronx. The actual content falls clearly short of the visuals, though it still hangs together reasonably well. Surprisingly director Bruce Malmuth has only helmed six films, though as one of those is called Fore Play and another stars Steven Seagull then it's perhaps not worth dwelling on. That said, his clever usage of low-key angles and long shots is what transforms a slightly below average movie into something worthwhile.Characterisation is both underdeveloped and stereotyped, from Rutger Hauer's cultured terrorist, to Stallone's embittered cop separated from his wife. Lando Calrissian seems oddly uncomfortable with his character, particularly in a scene where he threatens to shoot a drug dealer, and there's no real rapport between him and Stallone. But then this adds to the attempted realism, with a bearded, bespectacled Sylvester blending in to what is initially an understated film.Unfortunately, around the halfway point things go awry. A film that had taken in location filming in Paris and London, as well as subtitles and a surveillance search for a terrorist suddenly becomes a run-of-the-mill sub-actioner with helicopters and gun battles. What began as a relatively gritty cop drama collapses into far-fetched terrorism, gunfire and transvestism. It's not bad, and worth a glance, but it all could have been so much better...

I think that sums it up. Either that, or men in dresses. Yes, bizarrely, Sly cross-dresses in this remarkable film. Remarkable in a similar way to A.I.- one perfectly defensible part, and one part of utter, utter rubbish. Unlike A.I. where the end is atrocious, it is the start of Nighthawks which you should miss and start watching about 20-30 minutes in. It takes a long time to get going both plot-wise and any-sense-of-any-of-the-actors-not-imitating-short-planks-wise, but the plot is quarter-decent, if utterly unrealistic in a fairly spectacular way. Sylvester Stallone does, by the end, get into his role, although the director clearly felt he needed some scenes with human interest elements, which I think he interpreted as a plot for girls. Sadly, I don't think his scriptwriter had had that upgrade, so these are hardly of a high quality. The portrayal of the English left me baying for blood, and one actress' German accent is fantastic(ally bad). The explosions are second-rate and sadly rather infrequent for my taste, the love story is utterly unresolved at the end, the characterisation for any other than the main two characters is, um, more shallow than an essex boy after 12 pints, so, all in all, it could be worse, but not a whole lot. It is not a good film overall, but not the worst early '80s action film around.

When you have a terrorist in your sights, you don't read him his rights and let him call his lawyer; you take the shot.Astonishingly, there are still some people who don't get it, including the probable Democratic nominee for the Presidency.

Deke DaSilva (Stallone playing a Police Officer for the first time in his career) and Matthew Fox (Billy Dee Williams) are two New York City cops who get transferred to an elite anti-terrorism squad. About this same time, an infamous international terrorist called Wulfar (Rutgar Hauer) shows up in New York City.I'm not to sure why audiences stayed away from this movie, as it is a really good cop movie, with Sly (looking very much like Al Pacino in Serpico) putting in a good performance, alongside Billy Dee Williams and Rutgar Hauer. If anything it was ahead of its time. According to Hauer, Stallone was very egoistic and he constantly interfered with filming of the movie, even writing and adding some new scenes for his character because he was jealous that Hauer's character was doing more cool stuff in the movie. Two test screenings of the movie were shown, one with more Stallone's scenes and other with more Hauer's scenes. The version with more Hauer's scenes was better received by audience. This is why Stallone, known for his big ego, cut out some of the Hauer's scenes from the final version of the movie. The original cut of the movie was almost two and a half hours long. Stallone was said to be really disappointed with the way Universal studio reedited the movie (despite the fact that he did his share of reediting on the movie prior to the studio's interference). He was really upset because of the removal of his dramatic scenes with Lindsay Wagner, including an emotional scene between him and Wagner in a restaurant (only mentioned in the final version of the movie) where his character breaks down and cries after his wife refuses to remarry with him.Prior to its theatrical release, It was also severely cut for violence by both the MPAA. Amongst the scenes that were cut are the disco shootout which originally had Wufgar shooting and killing more people, and Wufgar's death scene in the ending which was almost completely cut out. An original uncut scene showed Wufgar getting shot five times (instead of twice) in slow-motion by DaSilva, and in the end, the final sixth shot hit him in the head blowing his brains out. An animatronic head of Rutger Hauer was made by special makeup artist Dick Smith and used in this scene.After starting in Rocky, Paradise Alley and Rocky 2, this is Joe Spinell's final appearance in a movie with his friend Sylvester Stallone.

Sylvester Stallone, who plays a cop, has two women in his life. The first is his ex-wife. The second is Stallone himself, when he dresses up like a woman in order to lure muggers to attack him. It is pretty funny watching him chase a bad guy while wearing a dress.Rutger Hauer plays a terrorist who has a female accomplice. In the opening scene, set in England, he compliments a woman selling perfume in a department store while he slips a bomb under the counter, blowing up her and lots of others moments later. Then he comes to New York and picks up a woman in a bar to shack up with while he plots his next attack. When she discovers what he is, he kills her, which is ironic, since he jokingly referred to himself as a lady killer earlier. Then he takes a bunch of hostages on a tram, killing one woman and dropping her body into the river just to show he means business.When Stallone foils this plot, Hauer decides to get even by killing Stallone's ex-wife. He slips into her apartment while she is washing the dishes. He pulls out his knife and sneaks into the kitchen behind her. Then, just when he is about to stab her, she turns around and we see that it is not her after all.

It would be more realistic for police to take the threats lightly without any actual evidence of an impending attack. It's also more dramatic for the police to be behind and trying to catch up. Not to mention that it makes no sense for the anti-terrorism squad to pull two street cops to fight a threat that may not even exist. The confrontation between Deke and Hartman in the police meeting room seems awkwardly wrong. Sly and Billy Dee never develop enough chemistry for a police buddy duo. They are not always together.

Wulfgar learns dignitaries of the United Nations are on a visit to New York, and sees an opportunity to get his name in the media once more.He bombs some buildings in New York's financial district, in an effort to spread fear, causing the U.N delegates to demand special police protection, the next night DeSilva and his partner Matthew Fox (Billy De Williams) find Wulfgar in a nightclub, which he usually goes to find a woman he can persuade to take him home with her so he can hide his weapons stash in her house, they chase Wulfgar through the subway but Wulfgar gets away, not before injuring Fox.The next day Hartman is killed by Wulfgar's accomplice, Shakka Holland (Persis Khambatta), at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, during a U.N visit to the museum. The U.N then board a tram to Roosevelt Island, Wulfgar and Shakka hijack the tram and hold the delegates hostage. As revenge for the subway chase the night before Wulfgar kills the wife of the French ambassador, but not before demanding DeSilva come and see it for himself.Wulfgar decides he wants an infant taken off the tram, DeSilva takes the infant off the tram, but before i does he demands to know why Wulfgar killed the woman, I wanted to the sadist replies, DeSilva asks if Wulfgar will kill him, All in good time Wulfgar replies.Wulfgar has demanded a bus take them to the airport where a jet will be waiting for him, police snipers are in position, DeSilva is ready to take the shot and end this terrible affair. Shakka is killed in a gunfight, and Wulfgar drives the bus into the East River whilst under fire, but escapes.Wulfgar, furious that his plan has been ruined, heads to the house of DeSilva's ex-wife Irene (Lindsay Wagner), he sees who he thinks to be Irene enter the house, he breaks in and gets ready to stab her in the back, Irene spins around and points a gun at Wulfgar, revealing it to be DeSilva dressed up in his ex-wife's clothes and one of her wigs.Cornered and with no-where to go Wulfgar lunges at DeSilva but DeSilva shoots him, Wulfgar goes crashing through Irene's front door and down into the street outside.An excellent film, with a nice blend of action, crime fighting, investigation etc, this film also offers a few sad parts, like when it is learnt children were killed in the London department store bombing, causing the IRA to refuse payment to Wulfgar, and when the wife of the French ambassador is executed.Definitely one of the most under-rated films of the 1980s!

So says Peter Hartman of Interpol (played with dry effectiveness by veteran British actor Nigel Davenport) of the plans of the evil and vicious international terrorist Wulfgar (Rutger Hauer) and his equally nasty sidekick Shakka Holland (Persis Khambatta..you remember, the East Indian chick with the shaved head in the first Star Trek movie). Amazing that this movie was produced in 1981, a full 20 years before essentially the same thing would happen in real life (in, where else, New York). The only difference is that in Nighthawks, the terrorist is essentially a lone wolf, whereas the guys who really did do the deed worked in groups and used airplanes. The results were the same; a bunch of dead people and bunch more really scared ones (the ultimate goal of terrorism..to incite terror).Hartman has recruited several New York City cops (among them sergeants Deke DaSilva and Matthew Fox, played by Sylvester Stallone and Billy Dee Williams respectively) to a counter-terrorist team. DaSilva and Fox have been working decoy, disguising themselves to chase after purse snatchers and the like. Now they've been ordered to be indoctrinated by Hartman in anti-terrorist techniques. DaSilva in particular does not like the idea of being trained to be essentially an assassin, but with some prodding from Fox, he ultimately goes along, begrudgingly. And as the movie progresses, he comes to understand why, and just how evil, ruthless and merciless his opponent really is. As Hartman tells them, This is a terrorist. He doesn't think like a criminal. He wants to be a hero. DaSilva eventually realizes that standard police procedures don't work against guys like him.Stallone's performance as DaSilva is his best ever; very understated and low key, which makes it even more effective. OK, so he looks like Serpico..even down to the glasses he wears..but he wears the look damn well. Williams does an equally fine job as his tough and occasionally unhinged partner Fox (it's fun to watch him essentially go psycho and shove a gun in a drug dealer's face early in the movie, then subsequently admonish DaSilva to take his hat off when going inside a department store to visit his fashion designer ex-wife, (Lindsay Wagner). And Hauer makes a real splash in his American debut. His performance as the thoroughly evil and equally arrogant Wulfgar is maniacally spot-on. To this day it's one of his finest performances ever.One big problem with this movie, and ironically it's with the best and most suspenseful scene in it; when DaSilva spots Wulfgar in a crowded discotheque. All of DaSilva's pious talk about not wanting to hurt innocent civilians goes right out the window when he shouts out, Wulfgar! in a nightclub that's full of them. It actually gets someone shot. But it's still a fun scene.OK, you KNOW DaSilva is going to get Wulfgar; it's the WAY he gets him that makes for such a good climax. A very satisfying ending to this overlooked gem.

I've enjoyed Rambo and Rocky sequels , but I think he should try his luck in thrillers too.The screenplay is good , but for a large part of the movie doesn't know what to do with DaSilva (Stallone). So , while the villain (Rutger Hauer is good as always in this type of role) is making next moves , the hero is sitting and learning about his modus operandi. Stallone is frustrated and so is the audience. I know this is important aspect of the story , but it could have been done much better.Thankfully , after the training part is done the movie starts to be really interesting. The chase scene is wonderful. The tension between Hauer and Stallone is good and the final of the movie is quite memorable. Billy Dee Williams (Empire strikes back) is OK as Stallone's friend.Director of this movie Bruce Malmuth had pleasure to work with 3 action stars  Sylvester Stallone , Steven Seagal (Hard to kill) and Dolph Lundgren (Pentathlon). This is definitely his best movie.One year later after this movie was done Rutger Hauer gave his iconic performance in Blade Runner . Stallone became Rambo and made third Rocky movie . Billy Dee Williams in 1983 defeated the Empire in Return of the Jedi. It's not the best movie in career for any of them , but certainly worth watching . I give it 7/10.

That is to say it is slow and built around a couple of key scenes. The act of simplifying the plot down to the most direct and necessary elements I like, the fact that much of the 100 minutes remaining could best be described as filler a less welcome by-product.Da Silva (pre-roids Sly Stallone) and Fox (Billy Dee Williams) are partners in New York City. The kind that are willing to see past the usual red tape to get the job done. Who knows maybe in 1981 this wasn't yet a clich√©? Da Silva is a bearded ex Vietnam vet with an ex-wife that he pines for and a hatred of unnecessary violence due to his war service.Fox has a beard too, but apparently not much other backstory worth relaying during the film.Gee I wonder if the ex-wife will somehow become involved and if Da Silva might be forced to choose between pacifism or a loved one? Into their standard beating down bad guys existence comes a German terrorist named Wulfgar (Rutger Hauer), who has recently set off bombs in the UK and has fled to the US to continue wreaking havoc. The powers that be decide they need more men on the street to track down Wolfie and so Da Silva, Fox and some others are dragged off the beat and summarily given training on anti-terrorist tactics; tactics a battle scarred Da Silva finds exceptionally uncool.The duo are initially reluctant to continue their anti-terrorist participation but soon Da Silva starts to learn how Wulfgar's mind works, and as he nears the prey things get personal and Wulfgar decides to teach Da Silva a lesson, as well as causing untold horror and mass confusion at the death of many innocent civilians.Of course this leads to various chase scenes and a standoff at the end of the film where many lives are at stake and there can be only one survivor.Nighthawks (terrible title) is actually pretty OK seeing as it is now in its 4th decade of existence. There is a very worthwhile footchase through the streets and subway tunnels of NYC that lasts a good 5 or so minutes and never gets boring. As mentioned it is the classic 80s technique of having two or three showcase scenes, with everything else merely building up to the next one, so don't expect wall to wall action. Perhaps as overcompensation for this when someone gets shot they manage to get knocked back about 40 feet, this is especially obvious in the latter scenes.Sly hadn't yet honed his 'yeah I'm dumb but I don't take myself too seriously' shtick &#x96; he even tries acting for a while &#x96; Billy Dee is surprisingly low key and basically window dressing here, aside from one scene where he is allowed to vent in full mother-f*cking glory. But it is Rutger Hauer as Wulfgar who practically demands you remember him. In the early scenes he plays things relatively straight but as the film progresses he becomes more and more hammy and over the top in his portrayal of what is admittedly a reasonably cartoony character.Nighthawks has precious little that will remain with you after you've seen it, but it remains a solid film with a couple of decent scenes and is a worthy early introduction to one Mr R. Hauer.Final Rating &#x96; 6 / 10. Sure the plot is basic and pretty clich√©d, but the film works and manages to at least handle the subject matter well.

Aiming for almost a Cold War-style realism over macho hijinks and explosions, this sees Stallone and his partner Billy Dee Williams (STAR WARS) on the track of a European terrorist with plans to blow New York sky high. It's a little similar to DIE HARD WITH A VENGEANCE in that respect.The film is quite old fashioned when viewed in a modern light the story is simple, straightforward and with only a few principle leads. Stallone underplays his part and Williams is underutilised, leaving newcomer Rutger Hauer to shine as the chilly, borderline-psycho villain (a role he would perfect in the following year's BLADE RUNNER). There are also minor parts for The Bionic Woman, Lindsay Wagner, British ex-pat Nigel Davenport and everyone's favourite MANIAC, Joe Spinell.There are decent chase scenes, an explosion or two and some fun to be had from seeing Stallone dressed as a woman and kicking butt as part of the 'decoy' scheme his department employs to entrap no-good hoodlums. The climax, a hostage situation set aboard a cable-cart high above the Manhattan streets, is well handled, followed by a bus stunt to rival SPEED and a neat twist ending that gets a good laugh.

It's a wonder why it's been overlooked in recent years, because it's a lot better than some of the films Stallone has made.There are some silly bits in it though, Hauer having a 'transformation' at the beginning, to look more like Rutger Hauer, Stallone overacting on several occasions with a funky beard and even funkier glasses, but the director knows how to handle the action well, despite it being very formulaic, and having a Brian De Palma ending.A little gem of a film well worth watching.Plus it's the best film with Stallone dressed as a woman at the beginning and the end, ever.

The plot is good and interesting and it never lets up. It also has a nice conclusion as well. The story has Stallone as a cop trying to stop an international terrorist, but he just does not seem sure of the right way to go about it. He seems conflicted about how to go about catching him while the terrorist has no such issues so lets just say he has the advantage through a lot of this movie.

The last scene of this flick will always be in my mind. if it wasn't for my girl I wouldn't be able to track it down. We were talking about movies as we do a lot and I said, there are two movies that aren't horror but are in my mind, and they concern men dressed as women. The first one was easy to find Dressed To Kill but the second one I only remembered the ending, won't spoil it. Lucky as I am with my girl she was also capable to remember it too. She found the title, I had to search me a copy, and I did in the Netherlands last week. Well, the movie is still one of a kind. Sylvester Stallone is in it, still earning his way to the top, in between Rocky and Rambo. Rudger Hauer was also on his way in Hollywood, this is his first real important appearances in an US movie, he was already famous in the Netherlands. Also in the picture is Joe Spinell. At least one connection for me as a horror geek. Spinell is well known for his sick performances in the underestimated gem Maniac and the forgotten flick The Last Horror Movie and of course the OOP The Undertaker. Never forget Spinell who sadly died in 89 due a heart attack. They all gave a real good performance. The movie is for his time still up to date and the killings are really bloody, of course it had to be, it was the period of the slashers. The storyline never lacks and the score made me think of Shaft. The only thing that was a bit too long was the scene at the police office were they explain the thing surrounding the terrorist. Anyway, maybe a bit of a rip off of Dirty Harry but the ending really makes the movie in all ways, acting, lighting, sound, cutting and camera.

When Wulfgar, a psychotic international terrorist on the run from Interpol, arrives in town, DaSilva is transferred to a team recruited to catch and kill him. Does DaSilva have what it takes to step up to the challenge ?This is a fairly standard cop vs psycho crime-thriller, high on action and low on subtlety, but I like it more than most for several reasons. Hauer is absolutely electrifying as the deranged killer, pulling us into the madness behind his eyes. The dark and grimy location photography is great and there's a weird symphonic funk score by synth-rocker Keith Emerson. It also features spectacular stuntwork by the great Dar Robinson, including a spectacular chase through the subway system. It has some limitations; the classic thriller problem where the hero doesn't have enough charisma and the villain has too much, and some silly moments, like Davenport's over-the-top antics during his Terrorism 101 class, but overall it's pretty good - dark and single-minded. The idea of a cop who doesn't want to deal with terrorists because he didn't join the police force to kill people is a nice idea, especially in the current climate, and I love the seedy locations in this movie - notably the Roosevelt Island Tramway that Hauer uses to stick-up the UN delegates. This movie also has some weird credits; notorious porn-star Jamie Gillis plays the minor role of Wagner's boss, and it was written by David Shaber (the screenwriter of The Warriors) and Paul Sylbert, a famous production designer who had no other connection with the film. Also, makeup genius Dick Smith was hired to give Hauer (in his first American film) an altered prosthetic face for the first half-hour, which is then removed for the rest of the movie. A good Saturday night thriller.

Murrah Federal Building brought alleged mastermind Timothy McVeigh to justice, and he was almost close to being like the fictional Wulfgar in Nighthawks for his ability to create fear around America.Chicago itself had terrorist bombings almost at the time the film was produced, by the FALN extremist group (one of the bombings struck a downtown Chicago theater), and this is just a number of U.S. terrorist incidents that makes Nighthawks quite believable on how international terrorism can bring innocent civilians around the world in fear.No wonder that a little over 15 years later after the movie was released, that New York would face real-world terrorism right at its core with the World Trade Center being the target, as I mentioned before.In Nighthawks, it was Sylvester Stallone (who played New York City policeman Da Silva), who has to meet up with one of the ruthless fictional international terrorists, Wulfgar (played by Rudolf Hagar). Wulfgar had already terrorized Europe with his bombings, and he entered the United States in the purpose to terrorize the country with the same thing. With all that, it was Da Silva who eventually has to stop Wulfgar's terrorist bloodshed. He eventually joins up with an anti-terrorist group called ATAC, which was sort of like Special Weapons and Tactics, also known as SWAT (used by most U.S. police forces), but this a different type of ATAC than one of the James Bond movies that used the term ATAC, which was an acronym for a submarine tracking system.The big turning point was when a top New York police official who masterminded the operation to stop Wulfgar thought he was in the right place at the right time, during a scene involving an ambassador's meeting. But it was at the wrong time, and he was assassinated by Wulfgar's accomplice, Shakka, a character who was from Morocco. As Da Silva saw the official already lying dead on the end of the escalator steps, he realized one thing the police official said before he was murdered--you have to picture the M.O. the terrorist would create for a future incident. This was why Da Silva dressed up as Shakka in his own room (the kitchen) as Wulfgar, armed with a knife, approached the house and into the kitchen thinking that it was Shakka. Wulfgar was wrong, as he realized that it was Da Silva wearing a female wig, as he turns to face Wulfgar with Da Silva holding a pistol...not Shakka! Wulfgar gets mad and is about to kill him but it was the end of Wulfgar as he is shot twice by Da Silva, goes through a front door window and breaking it, and he dies right on the front porch.Da Silva had done his job of taking out a wanted terrorist, although he could have taken him in to authorities instead of firing a second deadly shot.The scenes involving the bombing of a London boutique store and the Wall Street in New York evokes memories of another terrorist-related movie with a New York location---The Siege, featuring Denzel Washington as an FBI agent, which shows similar bombings which included a main Broadway theater.

With the proper handling, he may have had a career as successful as Sly Stallone, for example, or Harrison Ford. Alas, but that opportunity is now gone. He has done far too many B stinkers (though they arguably did not stink because of HIM) for that opportunity to survive.After a while, two names became synonymous with the bad B action flick, Rutger Hauer and Eric Roberts. If you see those names, the channel is usually turned, and quickly.But, as I said in the beginning of this review, Nighthawks was done in the day, when everyone waited expectantly for Hauer to be somebody. His performance in this is exemplary, and this is (in my opinion) Sly's best performance as a cop, and he's played plenty of cops. To round out the trio, we have Billy Dee Williams in a pivotal role as Sly's partner, ergo the second good guy in the scenario, which involves a global terrorist (Hauer) and the New York detectives who are after him (Williams & Stallone).All in all? This features some great action, a few truly tense moments, a solid story, and believable dialog delivery (something lacking in most cop flicks of this time). It was fun, interesting, and kept me watching. But in a word, this is dated, dated, dated! but don't remake it, please!

It's been one of my favorites ever since.Positives were the relationship between Wulfgar and DaSilva, the engaging soundtrack, and the fact that this movie had a GOOD plot (unlike many of Stallone's movies). The scene in the club and the stare down between DaSilva and Wulfgar (while I'm A Man is playing) is legendary.Things I would have changed were that the movie seemed cut-up (their seems to be many scenes that are missing), if there was more scenes between Stallone and Lindsay Wagner, it would have added to the drama. I think Billy Dee Williams could have been in it a little bit more. The ending was well thought out, but I think there could have been more. From what I understand, that was cut-up as well.

They don't pay attention to (and have no respect for) the British anti-terrorist expert who tries to teach them that anti-terrorism is not like common crimefighting. They don't listen, because they know they can easily capture Wulfgar, and crack jokes during their meetings. Finally, after Wulfgar continually out-thinks, out-runs, and out-maneuvers them several times, they finally begin to believe the anti-terrorist expert, and realize that Wulfgar truly is a master terrorist. When the expert is killed, that leaves only Billy Dee and Sly to stop a man who has out-matched every step of the way. In other terrorist movies, the bad guy is always seen as a huge threat and everyone tries to stop him.  Nighthawks is so brilliant because the first half of the movie shows the terrorist expert frustratingly trying to convince Stallone of Wulfgar's power, and Stallone stubbornly doesn't care, thinking Wulfgar is no threat at all.  He thinks it's overkill when the expert tries to prepare him for terrorism scenarios, but those lessons come back to be oh so useful...

They're frustrated, however, as their quarry proves more cunning and smart than the usual lowlifes they're used to catching.

DeSilva, now alone, goes after the desperate terrorist who's on the run.Critique Unusually gritty Stallone action vehicle didn't prove successful or widely distributed. Nevertheless, it featured his best starring role and it's a shame most fans haven't been able to pick up on it. Sporting a 'Serpico'-like beard, Stallone cuts down on the gung-ho poses that 'Rambo' and 'Rocky' fans have come to get bored of. Though not a total dud, DeSilva is still a rogue cop who predictably goes over his superiors. The film's international background (which includes scenes shot in Europe and use of subtitles) give it class and an international feel. It's funny to see how NY cops interact with foreign 'agents' and international politics. The teaming of Williams and Stallone proves surprisingly effective, counter-pointing suaveness and toughness. Also outstanding is Rutger Hauer's wicked terrorist Wulfgar (his debut American role). He shows the evil mindedness that would dominate his later screen persona.

The next day, Wulfgar then goes to take a cable car full of UN diplomats hostage. With DaSilva hot on Wulfgar's heels it is only a matter of time before the first man makes his move...Nighthawks is a gritty and realistic story about terrorism. With this film being made in 1980, the world was not as aware of terrorism as they are now. Likewise, with this film being made in 1980, it was Pre-Rambo and the majority of Rocky's so the audience get to see Stallone as a character actor rather than runner and gunner John Rambo. Sylvester Stallone gives a fantastic performance as DaSilva, as does Rutger Hauer as Wulfgar. The film has many memorable scenes but my personal favourite is the scene where DaSilva and Fox search a disco for Wulfgar and the chase that follows it. Those scenes are so tense and full of action that they arguably the centrepiece of the entire film. The ending will also shock the audience as well.A very underrated Stallone film.

"},{"Title":"A failure, with only a handful of highlights.","Date":"16 July 2009","Score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Crime, Thriller","Review":" Nighthawks (1981); Directed by Bruce Malmuth; Starring Sylvester Stallone, Billy Dee Williams, Rutger Hauer, Persis Khambatta et al.The film follows two NY undercover cops, Deke DaSilva (Stallone) and his buddy, Matthew Fox (Williams), and how they become involved in an anti-terrorist unit. Their mission is to hunt down international terrorist Wulfgar (Hauer), who is assisted by Shakka (Khambatta, known mostly for her role as 'Ilia' in Star Trek The Motion Picture). They've made the city of New York their next target. The plot is quite straightforward, but it has got some potential, especially with Rutger Hauer cast as the terrorist and Stallone as a tough cop. The end result, however, doesn't use this potential. This is mainly due to (a) an almost complete lack of logic and (b) the absence of a convincing reality.Starting with the unconvincing aspects. Our two main 'heroes' are supposed to be quite uncontrollable and tough-guys, but they only show this through shouting at their colleges, at their boss, at Wulfgar, or by just looking mean and angry. I think this is due to the lack of good direction, the lack of quality acting and the lack of a good script. Wulfgar isn't very convincing at being a terrorist either... You only have to look him in the eye with an angry facial expression and he pulls out a gun and starts shooting, in the middle of a disco (!). This isn't due to Rutger Hauer's acting though, since he delivers a really good performance. He brings a great flair to Wulfgar and makes him quite scary, considering the material he has to work with. He stands out as a highlight amongst the other actors. His assistant, Shakka, is portrayed as a merciless woman, but that's as far as her character goes. Persis Khambatta doesn't bring anything more to her role than the very limited script offers her, but she is adequate. Although others qualify Stallone's performance as one of his best, I found it to be quite bad. We're supposed to feel for DaSilva struggling with his (ex-)girlfriend and with him being trained to think and act like a terrorist, in order to take Wulfgar down. But, he isn't able to make DaSilva a real character, he doesn't bring him to life so to speak and therefore I couldn't care for DaSilva. This is also due to the bad writing, because these two points are completely underdeveloped in the script (and/or handled badly by the director) and should have been worked out much better in order for them to work properly. As it is now, the scenes where DaSilva gets upset over becoming like Wulfgar don't make much sense, because you don't get the feeling he's becoming like Wulfgar. Much of the potential drama is thus missing and this hurts the film badly. Billy Dee Williams is quite nice to watch though, but this is more due to his persona than to the character he's portraying, because he hasn't got much to do, besides following DaSilva around and in one occasion help him stay on the team. A note must go to Joe Spinell, for portraying Lt. Munafo (DaSilva and Fox's superior officer) quite well, he stood out as positive.On to my other major criticism the absence of logic. First, the mentioned scene with Wulfgar pulling a gun in a disco. It's completely illogical for a calculating and professional terrorist to pull a gun on someone he's never seen, especially in the middle of a disco with hundreds of people around. The chase scene following this is quite well done though and is one of the highlights of the film. Another example Wulfgar keeps his suitcase full of weapons and explosives at a girls place without locking it. Upon her opening it, he just shoots her and conveniently leaves a map behind for the police, with the last place he bombed circled. At the film's ending Wulfgar is supposed to be dead and by what we have seen, the logical conclusion is that he is dead, but he magically reappears for a final act of terror and a quite stupid twist ending. If we were given at least a simple explanation for his survival it wouldn't be such a bad thing, but now it just doesn't make sense. I can suspend my disbelief in films, but there has to be some logic to what's going on and that logic is missing in this film. Because you're uninvolved with most of the characters and because you keep noticing illogical plot points, the film begins to drag. Through all this, you just lose interest in the film and want it to end. Towards the ending it does pick up a bit though. There's quite a good scene on a cable-lift cart. Wulfgar and Shakka take everyone in the cart hostage and a rare moment of good film occurs. It's the best thing the film has to offer, followed by the fore-mentioned chase scene, involving a metro. These are sadly the only real highlights, besides Rutger Hauer, and they are too little to save the film.Concluding this film becomes uninvolving and therefore quite boring because of bad characters, uninspired acting by most involved, bad directing and an important lack of logic. There are too few highlights to make this film earn a positive rating. Only watch this when you want to see another good Rutger Hauer performance, or if you think you won't mind the things I disliked about it.It scores 4/10.

Oh yeah, if you're that kind of smart terrorist, you'll easily get every file of every cop and fed in the world. You ask how? Well, how's for suckers. This is the 80s. 4 points for Sly (whom i love) wearing a beard, and some quite exciting scenes.

He plays the role of an undercover cop from New York City named Deke DaSilva and he and his partner Matthew Fox played by Billy Dee Williams get assigned to go after an international terrorist named Wulfgar who is played by Rutger Hauer. Wulfgar is a renowned villain from a different continent who had his face changed by a plastic surgeon before arriving in New York City and Deke and Matt are the police officers assigned to figure out what he looks like now so that they can track him down and stop him. This movie has an intense thrilling surprise at the ending, so if you have never seen it before, then go rent it right away!!

They're not always as gruesome as the horror genre movies but the point is to create high tension. Unfortunately I barely felt any tension between scenes in this film. And that's only one part that could have been improved.To start off, Sylvester Stallone plays Deke DaSilva, a discharged soldier of the U.S. army who now is a cop in New York City. DaSilva cares about the safety of the innocent, yet he's too weak to pull a trigger on a villain. Why? He's nervous that he'll cause collateral damage. Well DaSilva, since you were apart of the army at one point, you should know then, that friendly fire isn't uncommon. Partnered up with Stallone is Billy Dee Williams or as everyone else knows him as, Lando Calrissian, plays a character called Matthew Fox. Both actors play their parts but I don't see any personal connection to them. Are they old pals? Or do they just work together really well? As for the antagonist of the plot, making a thriller requires one who has no conscious, and Rutger Hauer shows that perfectly. Hauer plays an international terrorist named Wulfgar and once the viewer sees how he acts, they will understand how he has no remorse. Wulfgar is a real jerk and he will make the audience hope that he dies a painful death. Thankfully, he does but I won't say how...obviously.The execution of the story, I wasn't pleased with. I know it can take time to build tension but look at The Mean Season (1985), no more than twenty minutes into the film, tensions begin to rise. It took almost half the film before Fox and DaSilva FINALLY run into Wulfgar. What's happening before this? Wulfgar is bombing other places in Europe, while DaSilva and Fox are busy learning in a class that teaches them how to fight terrorists. Seriously, how much slower could this thriller go? Maybe if Wulgar somehow slipped into the police station and started making a ruckus, then that would create some nice tension. But director Bruce Malmuth felt that featuring what's happening on two opposite ends of the world can create tension. How does that make any sense? When the movie approaches its second half, the audience will finally get to see SOME interesting scenes. Some parts, I'll admit, I've never seen happen in other films before but there weren't too many. For example, at one point, there was a long chase scene and it seemed to go on forever. The last thing I really could not grasp was the background music. Keith Emerson provides the music to this film and it lacks a lot of importance. It sounded more like it belonged to action scenes from the Television series of The A-Team. Music is supposed to help create feelings and I didn't feel anything.Paul Sylbert's story doesn't seem to make an effective transition onto the big screen. A callous music record, and slow moving scenes can make this thriller not very thrilling at all.

Yes there are a few scenes that will make you laugh out loud and even a good chase that's well directed and very exciting. The problem is it stops there. This is one boring movie. There's no other way to say it. Stallone is dull, the characters are badly developed and in the end its just a dated, bland movie that's forgotten for a reason it's a failure. The first half of the movie consists of Stallone sitting in a class learning counter-terrorist tactics while Rutger Hauer blows things up. It drags and drags and when something finally happens (the chase) I just didn't care anymore. It's not your typical Stallone movie and this time that's not a good thing. A tedious little movie that doesn't deserve any attention.

Director Bruce Malmuth, working from a tight and absorbing script by David Shaber, relates the gripping story at a constant brisk pace, builds and sustains a substantial amount of nerve-rattling tension, stages the exciting action set pieces with skill and flair (the ending in particular packs quite a fierce and rousing punch), maintains a hard, serious tone throughout, and makes expert use of the authentically gritty Big Apple locations. Moreover, Shaber's screenplay warrants extra praise for its uncannily prophetic pre-9/11 depiction of cunning and lethal terrorists who think outside the box and possess a terrifying willingness to do their awful misdeeds in a major metropolitan area. The sound acting from the tip-top cast rates as another major asset Stallone and Dee Williams display a convincing and engaging chemistry in the leads, Hauer impresses as a supremely chilling and cold-blooded villain, plus there are praiseworthy contributions from Lindsay Wagner as DaSilva's concerned girlfriend Irene, Persis Khambata as Wulfgar's loyal cohort Shakka Holland, Nigel Davenport as no-nonsense Interpol agent Peter Hartman, and Joe Spinell as DaSilva's huffy superior Lt. Munafo. Popping up in nifty bits are 70's porn legend Jamie Gillis as Irene's slimy boss and Catherine Mary Stewart as an ill-fated London department store employee. James A. Contner's slick cinematography gives the picture a sharp'n'glossy look. Keith Emerson's pulsating score further pumps up the ample suspense. One of Stallone's strongest and most underrated films.

Which Wulfgar explodes buildings for a living by killing several high-profile civilians. Peter believes Wulfgar's next target are Representatives from the United Nations. Wulfgar is also good at being at disguises and changing his looks as well. Wulgar isn't working along, since he has his associate Shakka (Persis Khambatta) helping him as well. Now Deke and Matthew do their best to find this terrorist, which they had a few close calls. But they don't realized that Wulfgar is extremely clever and he doesn't appear stupid as well. Nothing is predictable with this infamous terrorist.Directed by Bruce Malmuth (Hard to Kill) made an reasonably entertaining thriller with really good acting from Stallone and especially Hauer, who naturally steals the show. This was truly underrated, when it was first released in 1981. The film received good reviews but audiences didn't care at first and it was poorly marketed by Universal. Stallone claims there's was an better movie until Universal re-edited the movie, which it had more fleshed-out characterizations and including Stallone's ex-wife Irene (Played by Lindsay Wagner) in the feature. There's some good action sequences and the suspenseful scenes are genuine. Nighthawks has life somewhat popularity on video, especially when it is played on television. There's some really slow spots in the movie and the music score is really dated as well. But it shouldn't not stop you from enjoying. Nighthawks is a good underrated Stallone movie with a sharp performance by Hauer makes it worth viewing. Joe Spinell from the infamous Maniac fame appears in a bit role and a young Catherine Mary Stewart appears as a sales clerk. Also some viewers might get a few silly laughs seeing Stallone in drag in a few key sequences. (*** ¬Ω/*****).

Billy Dee Williams lends good support as Stallone's partner. Nighthawks is surprisingly one of Stallone's more obscure efforts despite the fact that is easily one of Stallone's overall best movies. I think the reason it isn't remembered as well is that it got it's thunder stolen by First Blood (Which to be fair is equally as good as this) also the fact that this felt more like a 70's style policer instead of the new era of 80's action might've contributed to this factor. However one of the biggest shocks about Nighthawks is how much more suspenseful it is then truly action packed. Indeed the shootouts are all adequate and such but Malmuth uses a far more intense approach to the action and delivers more a police suspenser rather than a police styled actioner. All and all it works very well at what it sets out to do, and if there is any surprise is that Bruce Malmuth went on to direct mainly B.movies after this, including Hard To Kill (Which was fine) and Pentathlon (Which was awful) As it stands I have no reserve about saying that this is the highlight of Malmuth's career.* * * out of 4-(Good) "},{"Title":"Hauer is great in his first American film","Date":"25 April 2007","Score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Crime, Thriller","Review":" Rutger Hauer, in his first American movie, plays Wulfgar, a terrorist with his eye on going international by coming to New York.

Yet, this cops and terrorists flick is just interesting enough to keep you watching. Rutger Hauer plays terrorist mastermind, Wulfgar (you know, the kind of mastermind who makes just enough mistakes to get killed off in the end) out to bring his brand of Communist chaos to America and Sly Stallone is the stone-faced and angry undercover cop who is assigned to find him (I'd be angry too if my career was a smoldering wreck; okay, that was a cheap shot).Malmuth keeps the movie plugging along with New York covered in a wet and grimy muck for atmosphere and Stallone (with Billy Dee Williams in for token black-guy partner support) chasing after Hauer, as the baddie knifes and shoots and blows up a fairly small portion of the Big Apple's population. The trouble with Stallone is that he is SUCH A PROFESSIONAL that he keeps missing Hauer. A British intelligence agent (Nigel Davenport) repeatedly yells at Stallone to start thinking like a killer and stop with the Police Academy crap! Ultimately, Stallone underacts, Williams resigns himself to be underused, Persis Khambatta (as Wulfgar's backup gal) understands that her boss is a liability to the International Union of Terrorists and Hauer gets to give a very spiritual send off to the poor shlubs he slaughters, You go to a better place.

Rutger Hauer plays a freelance terrorist who murders an IRA contact in London and flees to the USA, offering his services to anyone who wants them. He's so dangerous that some English anti-terrorist expert assembles a team of New York cops trained to kill him. Hauer and Stallone (the hero) both put in good performances in spite of the rotten material and Joe Spinell (Willy Cici in Godfather 2) was excellent as Stallone's boss but the script is dreadful, the plot is even worse, and my DOG could have written the hideously dated music. For a start, NYPD officers are not and never have been assassins. The IRA never in all its history used freelance bombers. Hauer's character (the near-perfect terrorist) leaves an unlocked case full of weapons in a girlfriend's closet and kills her, leaving behind a map with his last target circled. Hauer knows intimate details about Stallone and his team. HOW? There is, literally, no plot development at all.
