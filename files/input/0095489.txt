It is one of the few movies I see which have great sentimental value to me and unlike most other children's movies can be watched on two different levels. When the children see it they will watch a movie about how 5 baby dinosaurs find their way to the great valley, while older people will view it as a movie based around how an abandoned orphaned child copes with the loss of his mother. The symbolism is great for example the dark rainy scene, but I have always cried when I see it.For once A GIRL is seen as the the 'strong' character, Cera the triCERAtops (why does she only have one horn?) is headstrong and prevents female sterotyping. I think most people who can see movies with an open mind (hey it IS a kids movie so don't expect it to appeal to adults) will love this movie. Incedently my favourite character was Littlefoot, his birth was absolutly wonderful and unlike the other characters he actually looks like he has grown.Unfortunaly due to space I cannot go into detail about the brilliant design of the backgrounds, characters and music but if on a rainy day you have nothing to see go and see this. The LAND BEFORE TIME was made by Don Bluth.Unfortunaly none of the other follow on moives BASED on the 5 characters was ever is good as this one they are just too childish.I love this movie 10 stars....

Not only is it a story of friendship, courage and love, but it also demonstrates childhood friendships which are 'not allowed' due to classism or racism - Three-horns never play with Longnecks.  'Land Before Time', with its tribe of various dinosaurs plus a pterodactyl, is a story about putting aside so-called 'differences' and striving together in 'united we stand, divided we fall' fashion in order to leave the unlovely wilderness and find a land of freedom and equality (in this case the Great Valley).An excellent and unmissable adventure which will appeal to anybody of any age.The sequels sadly did away with the grittyness of this first film and instead turned to TV cartoonishness and pointless songs, but most of them (the boring Part 4 aside) are still very enjoyable.  But in the tradition of most series of films, the original is the best.

He has this wonderful soft blending of mainly the background colors (usually most notable in the sky), which suggests use of chalk pastels to create this effect. In every film of his that I've seen, he always has great (what I like to call) atmospherics. In this film, you notice it in the blowing of dust/fog, some of the fire effects with the volcanoes (mainly the falling fire sparks), the falling black ash before the characters reach the mountains that burn, as well as certain water effects.The vocal cast was really well suited to all their roles. There were a few instances where some of the lines were a bit muffled and hard to understand, but for the most part, the cast did really well with their lines, made them sound natural, and child-like, and managed not to be overly cute and obnoxious as some characters made for children's films inherently are.The score by James Horner is a wonderful addition to the film's atmosphere and really does a great job setting the mood. Horner always has a way of infusing his scores with a sense of romanticism that is often lacking in today's film composers, and this film is no exception. He makes really good use of his strings section, especially in this period of his work.To be sure, this film is a masterpiece! All of its excellent qualities are apparent while watching the film, most notably the animation (which is excellent for a late 80s film), the voice cast, the score, the story, and the art direction. Without a doubt, it would be well-deserving of a spot in any animated feature hall of fame.9 Stars out of 10!

Not even through the eight sequels, could they surpass the enjoyment of this one! The story is just classic. It's Don Bluth's finest work, I must say. It's ironically the only movie in the LBT series that was made for theaters! Pretty cool, huh?I couldn't believe when I read how this movie was only like 70 minutes long. It seems like a long time, since it's so good. You've got cool dinosaur characters, going alone on a journey to the Great Valley. I think it's entertaining the way they have different names for the dinosaur species. Like Sharp-tooth for a T. Rex, or Three-Horns for a Stegosauraus or Long-Neck for Brontosauraus. My favorite character is Peetree, who is pretty cute. Too bad about Judith Barsi dying. That actually makes it interesting because now I know all the times in the sequels she was voiced by a different person than this time. I hope I'll see this movie more often. It seems like forever since I've seen it.But then came the sequels. Part 4 was very nice(the best sequel yet), and Parts 2 and 3 were good, but after 4, let's face it. The movies are repetive and dull, just doing the same things its proceeders did. Why haven't they just made a TV show instead of all these sequels? Now, THAT would be something I'd like to see.

It turns out that shortly before Land Before Time was officially released, about one million dollars worth of footage was cut from the film.  Think about that the next time you watch it.  You'll notice things like how suddenly we cut from Sharptooth and Littlefoot's mom's battle to the earthquake sequence.

I remember how much this movie made me happy as a kid, brings me very happy memories. I remember as if it was yesterday how happy I'd get whenever they aired this on television every Christmas on RTP Madeira (our TV channel). I never failed to watch it whenever they aired it.It is a marvel. I'm not a big fan of Don Bluth's cinema, but this one is a masterpiece. Classic and timeless. Without a doubt, it's the best thing this guy ever did.'The Land Before Time' is epic, solid, touching, delightful and very artistic. The artwork is wonderful and super colorful. The story is great. Animation is terrific. The movie has immense charm, it's one of the most perfect movies ever made, done with heart and soul. Will go down in history not only as one of the greatest animated masterpieces but also as one of the all time greats in general. No question about that.The 5 main characters are enjoyable, even with their different personalities. Ducky is the cutest, most innocent and most endearing, plus she's got a really adorable voice (Judith Barsi's cute voice) which is in perfect harmony with her innocence. Cera is very stubborn and has got a short temper, but it's her strong personality what makes her another favorite. Therefore, for different reasons, Ducky and Cera are my two favorites.In conclusion, it's a generally innocent little movie, being only a little dark in a few scenes with Sharptooth, the vicious and giant dinosaur (couldn't be other than a T-Rex). Aside Sharptooth, the dinosaurs are portrayed as generally friendly and adorable creatures, being the exact opposite of 'Jurassic Park' on that matter. Title in Portugal 'Em Busca do Vale Encantado'.

Back then, they used to air this on television every Christmas and I always watched it whenever they aired it. At the time, I lived in another house. When I moved to my current house, they stopped airing this forever, something which upset me. After nearly 15 years without seeing it, it suddenly and unexpectedly came back in my life.This is one of the greatest animated movies of all times. Anyone who says this is one of Don Bluth's best or even his best work, I don't have any reasons to argue against that because that's exactly what I think. It's charming, masterfully made, memorable, classic and timeless.As a movie, it is heartwarming most of the time, but also dark and sentimental sometimes. This is no comedy, but has its funny moments. The plot is good, the animation is great, the artwork is superb and the main characters are easy to sympathize with Littlefoot, Cera, Ducky, Petrie and Spike. I especially like Cera and Ducky. Cera is hilarious, difficult and challenging to get along with, stubborn, selfish, overconfident, much self-proud and has a strong personality. Ducky is cute, loving and she's got a really cute voice. Yep, yep, yep!It's easy to see where Cera got her name from. She got it from her own species - she is a Triceratops (see?), even though her name sounds exactly like Sarah.Is this a suitable movie for children? Yes, of course, but some parts can be a bit scary for some, particularly any scene with the vicious T-Rex Sharptooth.Some elements of the story and artwork resemble Disney's Bambi and one of the segments from Fantasia, The Rite of Spring. In some ways, The Land Before Time also served as an inspiration for Disney to create The Lion King, although The Land Before Time is the better film.Actually, I consider this an excellent alternative to the more popular Disney classics, being not only as good as the best Disney classics but also superior than many Disney classics. And since I made this comparison, one thing that sets this apart from Disney classics is that there are no songs. There is only background instrumental music and a song at the end, but the characters never sing in the whole movie.The movie's an interesting take on dinosaurs, these amazing animals. I only wish it hadn't become a victim of its own success. I mean, it gave birth to 12 sequels! Wow, that's beyond crazy!This should definitely be on Top 250.

It is a great animated dinosaur film and also one of the best dinosaur films ever made.As the world is in turmoil much of the food that the dinosaurs eat disappears. Therefore all the dinosaurs must travel to the great valley where food is in abundance. Littlefoot, a young brontosaurus, is separated from his family and must make the travel by himself. However he soon joins up with other young dinosaurs of various species and together they embark on a journey that will change their lives forever.First of all there is one complaint that I have with this film and then I will say all the things that I like about it. This film does not follow the time period in which dinosaurs lived. Therefore they show dinosaurs living with other dinosaurs that they really did not live with. Like how they show Sharptooth attacking Littlefoots mother who is a brontosaurus. This would not really happen in real life because Brontosaurus and Tyrannosaurus were separated by more time than Man and Tyrannosaurus were. Also they show a dimetrodon in this film and he for damn sure lived in a completely different time period completely from all dinosaurs. So this is an animated film and it overlooked the different time periods which did not surprise me. But I notice because I am a huge dinosaur follower. So this is not that bad of a flaw but it is a mistake.OK now for the good points. I love the plot. Young dinosaurs on a long journey working together is great. Overall I like films where a long journey is involved because it makes the ending seem satisfying.THe animation is awesome as well. Very well done. Also they did an exceptional job with the new Tyrannosaurus body design which showed him not dragging his tail and instead using it for balance. All of the dinosaurs look good in this film and there is a pretty good selection. However the main dinosaurs are young dinosaurs but there still are a lot of awesome adult dinosaurs as well.I think that a major theme in this film is equality between different races. Hear me out. A young brontosaurus, triceratops, stegosaurus, hadrosaurus, and pteranadon must all put aside their differences and work together. IT does not matter that they all are different, if they all want the same thing what does that matter? So I think the theme works for me at least because I think all the different dinosaur types working together portrays the message that people should all be equal.A major reason that this film is great is that it has one of the best villains ever in an animated film. Sharptooth the Tyrannosaurus is awesome. Scary and vicious and also a major threat to the characters. When I was a kid he terrified me. One of the best dinosaurs period in a film ever if you ask me.The music works well also. The main theme song Dont lose your way goes good with this film. Maybe one of the most under rated songs used in a film ever.THis film is very touching at parts. Like the relationship between littlefoot and his mother being threatened, or how Ducky befriends Littlefoot when he is in need of a friend. Very emotional film.Great animated Dinosaur film. The best ever in my opinion. THis is the also the best of the entire land before time series by far. Highly recommended for kids and adults alike.

Since dinosaurs are so appealing to young kids, films about dinosaurs, but in a less frightening tone, attract kids. And The Land Before Time is perhaps the best out of them. What it does that other movies about talking dinosaurs do not is that it makes the world in which they live seem perilous and like a nightmare, as children often imagine these enormous reptiles to have lived in.The movie is an animated classic in all regards. Like I mentioned earlier, it plays seriously to make the dinosaur world look hostile, but it doesn't overplay its part so that it gets too frightening. The characters, whom are lovable mostly in the first film, are wonderfully brought to life. Don Bluth's animation team and the talented voice acting done by actual children instead of just voice artists, makes the film work out. Each character has a personality and although they aren't developed an enormous level, they are worked just enough as needed to satisfy us. In a way, the sequels help to enhance their development, but only in mediocre films. In the original, we just simply become attached to the characters as characters.Even the antagonist, a Tyrannosaurus rex called Sharptooth is a great character. Sharptooth is really one of the best of the animated villains. Appropriately, he has no dialogue. He does not speak or taunt verbally. Like children imagine a Tyrannosaurus, he's a dangerous killer who attacks oftentimes out of hunger or even just cruelty. Effectively animated, Sharptooth is frightening to young children. There is a rumor that many of his scenes were deleted because they were deemed too frightening and this is certainly possible. Sharptooth's initial attack is truly powerful and for kids, terrifying. And because Sharptooth seems to always come back with a vengeance, makes him a memorable villain.The music score was conducted by James Horner, and his soundtrack is an absolute success story. The main theme is a very moving piece of music, and it suits the film very well, seeing as how it plays numerous times over the course of the film. It also has very thunderous scores for the scenes with Sharptooth. And there is the much-acclaimed song by Diane Ross If We Hold On Together, which plays during the end credits. Bottom line, the music score is very excellent.The Land Before Time is a classic and a great film for audience members of all ages. And it still holds out today because many adults can still enjoy it. Dinosaurs are loved by children, and therefore children love movies like The Land Before Time. A few minutes ago, I finished watching the movie in its entire form for the first time in years. It worked its magic on me again. It is notorious for suffering from, as one credit called it, Excessive Sequel Syndrome. True, there are countless sequels and many of them are strictly mediocre. And no classic like the original.

Trim, but a minor classic all its own. THE LAND BEFORE TIME, by acclaimed animator Don Bluth (AN American TAIL), is a kids movie that can be as equally enjoyable to the adults, once they know it's film that's not entirely for them. The film has a terrific story, and some adorable characters and fine visuals to go with it. The adults might think that this might be a good babysitter to younger audiences, but, if it is, it could be the very best one there will ever be. You can watch it with the kids, and you won't have to worry about being bored. Because, unlike Bluth's ALL DOGS GO TO HEAVEN, it isn't to childish to limit itself as a total kids flick.The story is about survival, setting place during the dawn of the dinosaurs. The plot is probably inspired by the FANTASIA segment The Rite of Spring, which shows the life during the age of dinosaurs, and the torrid confrontation with survival after wards when a heavy drought wipes out their resources and they're forced to migrate.Now, variate that plot and have younger dinosaurs do all the work, and you get the idea of THE LAND BEFORE TIME. But, really, it was more than that. Bluth provides his talent charms in directing animated films, this time widening the target audience, and results in a story worth telling.Even if you know what might happen, it has charm, it has peril and also has drama, you don't really care and just let the scene take you away. There are lots of these dramatic and charming scenes. There are also a few scenes of peril and suspense, which may scare the kids.But overall, THE LAND BEFORE TIME is a good time watching movies. It's one of the best fables to come out of it's time. High recommendations all the way.Rating ***** out of 5. "},{"Title":"A great movie.

This happens to be the first movie that introduced me to dinosaurs. The animation and visuals are stunning, a similar style to American Tail and in some way the Rescuers. In terms of colour, it is quite dark, but it does need to be, as it is quite a dark and very poignant film. I realised as I watched it, that the beginning reminded me a bit of the dinosaur segment in Fantasia. The music by James Horner is gorgeous, haunting in some parts, and then so heart-rendingly sad in others. This is the composer who brought us the music for American Tail and Once Upon a Forest(both of which made me cry). Land Before Time made me cry too, because Littlefoot's mother's death is one of the saddest deaths ever portrayed in an animated film. I also thought the narration was very thoughtful and factual, I actually learnt things from the narration alone. The voice talents were exceptional, Judith Barsi a standout as Ducky(sweet and funny at the same time), voicing engaging and memorable characters. I was appalled when I read that Judith Barsi was murdered not long after she voiced Anne Marie in All Dogs Go To Heaven, because she was a very talented actress, the characters she created were both likable and sweet, and it is such a shame that something that dreadful would happen to her at an early age. Littlefoot is also very sweet, nothing like how they portray him in the countless sequels. People have argued that there isn't much of a story, but this is an example of a character-driven animation, and there was plenty of character here. I personally think that this is the most poignant of the Don Bluth movies, and if I had a minor criticism, it is just that children may find the sharp tooth too frightening, but that was the intention, as the characters are afraid of it. Also it is a tad too short. Anyone who hated this, do bear in mind that it is vastly superior to all of the sequels, which range from good to unwatchable. In conclusion, a beautiful and poignant film, that is definitely one of the better Don Bluth movies. 9/10 Bethany Cox.

This was one of them, and it is a film that, for a certain sort of kid (such as myself) can be watched countless times. It's short, maybe too short as one of its flaws (Bluth didn't retain final cut with Spielberg and Lucas in the background), as it only develops this epic tale of kiddie dinosaurs going through a harsh, dangerous journey to reach the oasis, the Great Valley. There aren't any time for songs, which is a plus, as Bluth gets in more time for some very realistic- for what is available at the time- animation of the environment. The kiddie dinosaurs themselves, Littlefoot the main protagonist (who also loses his mother, in the Bambi and Lion King vein though here even more of a shock to kids as its from nature and not from some other being to grasp), Cera, Petrie, Ducky and Spike, each have their own personalities ranging from heroic to goofy to scared and even stuck-up. This gives something that kids can hang on to, very simple characterizations that change only through the often used but not too tiresome ideal of friendship and group-work, etc etc.Some of these scenes, the sillier ones, do end up making it more of a movie that holds more for the kids than the adults. That years later it doesn't lose much of its power visually, however, is a real credit to Bluth and his team, who along with An American Tail here make children's movies that know what they are, but make them in brilliant uses of the medium. The Tyrannasorus Rex- Sharptooth- is an immensely imposing presence with it saying never a word, as if it was pulled right out of the sequence from Fantasia. The design of the film is also extremely well laid, in a kind of dying world that like all fairy tales becomes all the more compelling in relation to what is the final paradise-type goal. It could almost be said that it might be much for wee little ones (younger than 5) could take, but it really wasn't as I remember it from first seeing it. It balances its look with its characters, making it a near-classic film of its time. Alternately cute and violent, poetic and kitschy.

It was the first movie that I remember watching. Even today, the characters are like friends to me. The movie, as well as its successors, develops them so well that you can easily become acquainted with one or more. Though many consider The Secret of NIMH for this title, The Land Before Time, in my opinion, is Don Bluth's masterpiece.In a land in the prehistoric age, a drought is occurring and several herds of dinosaurs seek an oasis known as The Great Valley. The animation here is very dark and fluid with a nice, earthy color scheme and some amazingly skillful footage of sand wind and the moon's reflection in a lake. You can always tell something is done by Don Bluth by the animation.The dinosaurs are only stopping on their way to the Great Valley to hatch their young. One of these newborns is an apatosaurus named Littlefoot. He immediately grows close to his mother, and as the narrator tells us, knows that they would always be together. The scene where he hatches is a piece of art.One scene later, Littlefoot is older and is able to talk. We're not sure how long it's been, but short enough that Littlefoot's mother is just telling him about their journey as she gives a star-shaped leaf, which they call a treestar. When Littlefoot asks her how she knows the Great Valley exists when she hasn't seen it, she replies, Some things you see with your eyes, others you see with your heart. This was is one of many very memorable scenes for me. And like the flashback scene in The Secret of NIMH, there's a sense of wonder as Littlefoot's mother lowers her head to give Littlefoot the treestar. There's hair-rising music in this scene too.While we're on the subject, this film's breathtaking music composed by James Horner is way up there with the score he wrote for Titanic. I have every single note of the music from The Land Before Time memorized, and it describes the epic tone of the movie flawlessly.Littlefoot starts to wander off and finds a family of triceratops, including a female hatchling named Cera (spelled as it is in the middle of the word triCERAtops). Littlefoot starts to play with her, but is stopped by Cera's father, who is the most racist dinosaur in the series. As Littlefoot continues the journey with his mother and grandparents, his mother explains to him the dinosaurs' prejudiced behavior nowadays.Very early the next morning, as Littlefoot chases a frog, he encounters Cera again. They play together briefly, until a ferocious t-rex attacks. He almost has them, before Littlefoot's mother comes to the rescue. But at the same time, a massive earthquake opens a deep ravine that divides Littlefoot and Cera from their herds.Littlefoot finds his mother languishing. Under the last of her breath, her final words to him are Let your heart guide you. It whispers, so listen closely. This scene is so heart-wrenching that I can't watch it without getting tears in my eyes. That and this movie was one of the first things that brought to me the concept of death. It seems Littlefoot didn't know what death was, either, before his mother died. When I had learned what really happened, I was haunted. Now Littlefoot has to make the long journey without her. As a child, it was tough for me to wrap my mind around that.Littlefoot, sad and confused, meets an old Polacanthus named Rooter. He tells him why he's so depressed, and that he blames all of his pain on his mother. He explains to him that it's no one's fault and is part of the great Circle of Life (my only quibble with The Lion King). Later, the treestar his mother gave him floats down toward him as he hears her heavenly voice speaking to his heart. As he looks into the drop of water in the treestar, she reminds him to the follow the sun and watch for the landmarks.Soon, Littlefoot meets up with a saurolophus named Ducky. Acknowledging the racial issues among other dinosaurs, Littlefoot still offers for Ducky to come with him to the Great Valley to find her parents. Soon after, they run into Petrie, an aerophobic pteranodon who and has yet to learn to fly. Littlefoot and Ducky invite him to come too. These last few scenes succeed in lightening the mood after the emotional blow of Littlefoot's mother's death. The movie knows when to be upbeat and when to be emotionally stirring. This a bit more what An American Tail should have been like.They run straight into Cera, who claims that she woke up the t-rex from the floor of the abyss. As she brags about how brave she was, she accidentally flings Ducky into a clump of grass where a stegosaurus is just hatching from his egg. Ducky names him Spike, and tells him to come with them to the Great Valley. Spike, who doesn't talk, swallows up all the grass around his nest and then joins the group. So the five hungry dinosaurs set off for the Great Valley, Littlefoot leading the way.If you haven't seen this movie yet, you should. It is just epic. It's a great story with glorious animation and breathtaking music. Through my childhood, I had come to know the characters almost intimately. If I was lacking friends, I always had Littlefoot. When I needed a laugh, I had Petrie. You might think I'm being silly, but this really is how I felt. Though I still enjoy most of the sequels, not one of them has matched this animated masterpiece. It will stay with me for the rest of my days.10/10 for The Land Before Time.

The characters are very easy to relate to and feel sorry for. Everyone has their own unique personality, especially Cera becomes interesting because she is so stubborn. The movie teaches that being stubborn and rude dosen't last, that being kind and humble earns you friendship.

I've viewed this movie MILLIONS of times, and could not find a single flaw with it. Don Bluth once quoted, Kids can deal with sad qualities in movies as long as you attach a happy ending to it. Well, this quote is completely true. Most of this movie is dark, starting with the first 30-minutes. It's even been known that many of the scenes with the T-Rex were cut out because of apparent scared feelings left to children. It's just genius to think you'd include DEATH, PERIL, and every other dramatic element in a animated, G-Rated movie. The movie isn't always dark though. Much of it is very faith related, and teaches a valuable moral that sticking together and helping each other, can pay off.....whoops. The real lesson was.....See? The movie teaches so many lessons, like to stay faithful, stick together, to keep moving on in life. I could list twenty of these. Don Bluth was, and still genius. I'd like to think that he knows how to connect animated movies,a nd give interest to both kids and adults. I still watch this, and I've been out of college for 8 years. When I was a kid, I watched this movie with my mom all the time, and she found it mildly interesting. I think when you can peak interest to both children and adults, and yet make it dark enough and light enough to balance it so it would get enough interest.Unfortunately, the second movie onward weighed on on the kid factor, making this the best of the.....1...2....3...Oh yeah, 11! This seems to be one of the many movies Don Bluth directed that weighed the kid friendly animation factor, to the dark, adult factors. That's how perfect Don Bluth directed this movie. I also want to make a honorable mention to Judith Barsi, who was taken from us much too early, as her father was drunk, and found out his wife was leaving him, and then shot Barsi and her mother.

The only difference is I probably won't watch it twice a week for the next two years.The Land Before Time tells a simple story of a dinosaur named Littlefoot, who loses his mother to the deliciously one-dimensional, gravity-defying, vicious tyrannosaur known as Sharptooth. Together with four other lost dinosaurs he searches for the Great Valley, but is slowed by the group's lack of cooperation or trust for one another. The must overcome their personal differences - and the ever-prowling Sharptooth - to reach their goal, and choose to do things the right way, even if that means choosing the hard way.For a movie that suffered so much during its production phase, and one which left the producers and directors dissatisfied, its a wonder LBT underwent the success it did at the box office. Don Bluth delights in making cartoons that are both dark and heartwarming, and LBT is no different. The characters will scream and shiver in fear as Sharptooth prowls around their hiding spot, but in other scenes they laugh and interact as would 'normal' children. Due to Spielberg's influence a lot of these darker scenes were cut from the film (probably good due to the film's young audience) but many still remain, enough to make the movie reasonably suspenseful, and with more bite than a typical Disney film (quite literally).The orchestral score is as beautiful as the artwork depicted in the movie, arguably better than the film, though it is often obscured by the sound effects employed. The two elements come together to shroud the world in an air of mystery, adding to the quest-like atmosphere in typical Bluth fashion.The film does stoop to a few predictable elements, such as the character that appears to die dramatically only to return less than a minute later. Littlefoot's mother also dies (no real surprise there) but watching Littlefoot's misery afterward - and little touches, of his wandering footsteps shown from the air following a much larger pair of footsteps in a search for companionship - has the potential to pull your heartstrings, as it did mine.The film tackles the issue of racism that was (aparrently) prominent in America at the time. In the beginning of the film, Littlefoot is prevented from playing with Cera because threehorns never play with longnecks. Cera heeds her father's (poor) advice, but only by working with Littlefoot are the group able to reach their goals. It's nice to see a film with underlying messages like this. Modern films, like The Lion King, though good, are rather hollow in that aspect (though I hear many children now fear their uncles). The Land Before Time will teach younger children that they'll do far better if they put pride and discrimination behind them. Doing so in a humanistic fashion is more than tolerable considering the film's audience.All the characters in LBT are colourful but Littlefoot is the most likable (in this writer's opinion). While re-viewing this film after so many years, it was interesting to see the obvious emergence of his ability to lead. Though he is a child, when hiding from Sharptooth, he directs Cera's movement to prevent their discovery. He soon becomes the deferred leader of the group, mostly because he's the only one who knows how to reach the great valley, but also because he's a genuinely motivating and kind character, without being repulsive in an over-sweet manner.There is SOMETHING missing from the film however, possibly exactly what Don Bluth has commented on when he mentions his own dissatisfaction. The film ends after a measly 69 minutes (due to all the cuts), and as a child I was always wanted more. I am no different as an adult, the only difference is I now turn to the internet rather than rewinding the film and starting again. Something just isn't satisfying in the Land Before Time. That might be why so many sequels were spawned, and though they're entertaining for younger children, with singing and adventures and reasonably-tolerable dialogue, they don't have the darkness, that makes the light at the end of the tunnel that much brighter.

Two of them were Steven Spielberg's epic film of the 90s Jurassic Park and Disney's mega-budget from the early 2000s Dinosaur, but before all of that, there was Don Bluth, who directed his magnum opuses The Secret of NIMH, An American Tail and All Dogs Go To Heaven, but later teamed up with Steven Spielberg and Star Wars creator George Lucas to create this animated prehistoric masterpiece known as The Land Before Time.It tells the story about a young brontosaurus named Littlefoot who is orphaned when his mother is killed by a Sharptooth. He then flees famine and upheaval to search for the Great Valley, an area which has been spared devastation. On his journey, he meets four young companions Cera, a Three-Horn Ducky, a Big Mouth, Petrie, a Flyer and Spike, a Spike-Tail as they try to avoid the sharptooth while going into dangerous places in a tale of survival, love, friendship, and teamwork.Aside from the 70 minute length, there's a lot of good things to offer. The animation in this movie is shockingly impressive, the acting is amazing especially the child actors who portrayed the kid dinos. The music score from James Horner is the best and it was innovative and very emotional. Even the song If We Hold On Together performed by Diana Ross was brilliant. The tone of the movie was as dark as Bluth's previous entries in the 80s that drives the movie with drama, suspense, and very touching moments.The Land Before Time is one of Bluth's magnum opus that has adventure, suspense, conflict, and emotionally sad moments and will go down as one of the greatest animated movies ever made.

Of course you have the iconic scenes, but watching this movie as an adult is even better than watching it as a kid, because every scene stands out at you. I actually felt more emotional and sympathetic towards the characters than I ever did as a child, and it really makes a difference.The movie was made in 1988, and was graced with an array of twelve horribly voiced, animated, and executed musical sequels that sometimes cover up the light of the original film (too much of a good thing isn't always good.) The first movie is a masterpiece, one of the few animated films ever made that provoke serious emotions and understanding of the need for companionship.The story focuses around five young dinosaurs in a time where the world was a mostly barren place. After all of them are separated from their families, they find each other one-by-one and stay together, trying to find the one place on earth they have a chance of surviving in. What makes this plot so unique are these five characters, because they're not perfect friends and individuals, they have problems, ghosts, and don't always see eye to eye, making them a realistic and believable group of friends. However, by the end of the movie they've gone through so much together that they can't help but love one another. Now, of course, the sequels lack the chemistry shown in the first movie, so they aren't even in the ballpark of how fantastic this film is.On the technical side of things, the animation is great, a true example of classic cartooning. Everything is so smooth and attractive, and at the same time, the darkness of the story gives it a gritty look that doesn't seem out of place at all with the cute little dinosaurs. As for the music, well let's just say that The Land Before Time would be a very mediocre film if it weren't for the score. This is by far the only score that's been able to instantly bring me to tears upon hearing it, because after seeing it set to such a happy ending after such a dark and depressing movie, it leaves a serious impression.So, all-in-all, if you haven't seen this movie, see it. It's a classic that shouldn't be passed up, and it only gets better with age.

I recently watched it again and it is still a great movie to see even being twenty-six years of age now.I love journey movies like this one. Homeward Bound and another great children's movie. I feel that it makes for a great plot and really feels epic with the characters having to travel unimaginable distances. I think it was great how something as sad and real like Littlefoot's mother dying happens in a movie like this. All too often a movie would be afraid to put something like that it a movie geared towards such a young demographic, but it really enhances the film. Yes it's very sad, I'm pretty sure I cried when I first saw it back when I was five, but it is so powerful a scene that it makes this film one I could remember for years and will remember for the rest of my life.I can't remember such an epic amazing children's movie ever being made, aside from maybe The Lion King and The Brave Little Toaster, both of which I hold on the same pedestal as this for my pick as greatest animated, children's film ever made.

When I was 11 I saw the first sequel o LBT The Great valley adventure,and found it far not as good as the first movie, in fact I didn't actually like it, maybe just a bit.Then I didn't see LBT anywhere until 2007, when I got unlimited internet connection and finally got a chance to know about all things I missed during my childhood, I found one of LBT songs from LBT 13 and found it very cute, because of Petrie's singing there.I was impressed by amount of these movies, I thought they should be more successful than 2-nd movie of there are so much of them and decided to download all movies. Well I just made myself watch Great valley adventure, to so to say remember LBT characters and storyline. Then LBT 3 and it was a bit better, but still drawn worse than first movie and worse overall of course.so I watched all sequels 4-6 and got used to it's stile-not amazing, but good to remember childhood.But when I watched The Stone of Cold Fire, I felt something changed, strong dialogues, Great-drawn Amazing storyline, They DON'T meet new friends and other nonsense some of LBT haters say they only met 3 villains and 2 friendly aliens, researching the main characters doing miraculous things like traveling in another place very fast(life is full with little Mysteries) and other mystic stuff, this whole movie is filled with mystery, and meanwhile it doesn't go far from the main storyline, This movie is totally different from previous 6 as a new Millennium it's quality is much better and continues improving with later sequels. I really enjoyed this movie ,and it's actually looking as the second movie of LBT deserving for Family rating, Everyone Young and old will most likely love it.2 of 3 songs in The Stone of CF are not childish, they are just great, every word is catching, maybe because adults sing them.Also a Science fiction storyline is extremely rare for childish cartoons and realistic once( reminds me show LOST where all begins realistic and them and then goes to science fiction with time traveling) and revealing aliens at the end just blew my mind! This movie has an excellent stile, especially Pterano's personality, and his voice(Michael York did great job), SOCF is also tougher than the other onces, and at the same time it brings good moralities, where can bad leadership bring to, and that some people who seem bad have heart too, they are just confused like Pterano. I'm also glad there were SciFi instead of magic, if This stone was magical it would ruin the whole LBT universe Every time I re-watch this movie I more realize how great it is, it isn't silly as any previous sequel.Also the soundtrack is amazing.Some people think it would rather better to make a series instead of movies, my question to you ARE YOU SICK?? You really think that low quality 20-min time limited episodes would do anything good?? Sooo in 2007 a lame cartoon series of LBT released, drawn with low quality, repeating songs, silly story lines, dialogues, can't say it is worse than The Great valley Adventure, but most of episodes a really not so good, they are just childish and not for the whole family to watch, just made for kids,and for Little kids.About other Sequels, I think The Stone of Cold fire made a new level for the sequels, made them not only for children(who definitely like them)but for the whole family again, almost as it was with the first movie, which is the best for all times, but if there were no sequels I'd rather live sadder, most of LBT sequels brought much happiness in my life, and NO other cartoon is even close to it's greatness.

Along the way Littlefoot meets Ducky (Judith Barsi) a big mouth (duckbill dinosaur) and Petrie (Will Ryan) a flyer (Pteranadon) and they decide to go to the Great Valley too. Along the way they run into Cera a threehorn (Triceratops) who met Littlefoot during his mother's encountered with the sharptooth and she tells them that the sharptooth is alive but Littlefoot believes the Sharptooth is dead! Soon they meet an orphan spiketail (Stegasauraus) and Ducky names him Spike! The five dinosaurs continue the journey to the Great Valley. At first they follow Littlefoot until his way doesn't seem to be working then they follow Cera until she leads them into danger! Feeling guilty for what she's done Cera leaves the group sad and ashamed! Littlefoot, Ducky, Petrie, and Spike continue on the journey through water when they run into Sharptooth who is in fact alive! Ducky lours Sharptooth into the water and Littlefoot and Spike and Petrie try to push a rock on top of his head and Cera returns to help the others push the rock onto Sharptooth and sends him sinking in the water to his death! Soon the Ghost of Littlefoot's Mother appears and she guides Littlefoot and the others through a cave where at the end stands the Great Valley. The kids are reunited with their parents. Littlefoot with his Grandparents, Cera with her father, Petrie with his mother and siblings, and Ducky with her mom, dad, and siblings. Since Spike's Parents died before he hatched Ducky's parents decide to take him in as their own son! The five dinosaurs become friends and have adventures awaiting them in the Great Valley a wonderful place to grow up! Be a big fan of both Dinosaurs and Don Bluth I was just blown away with it!

Of course, the first is the only one worth watching.The storyline is a bit like Watership Down, but with dinosaurs. It's fun and uplifting with morals of teamwork and courage. The animation is not as good as Disney, but the backgrounds excellently portray the dying world that our young protagonists struggle through. Like Balto, there are no songs - just action, suspense and light hearted humour. If there's one think I truly love about The Land Before, it's that it''s not afraid to show the truth. It doesn't water anything down - unlike the sequels. It's shows some characters dying, and how a young child copes with death. Don Bluth makes it suitable for children, but dark enough for adults.As with most of their animated DVDs, Universal made a very poor DVD version.

The story is the tale of five young dinosaurs who after a terrible earthquake are making their way to the great valley, a paradise were they can again be reunited with their parents. The characters are a beautiful bunch. The main identity throughout the film is littlefoot a baby brontosaurus, though he is by no means the best character. Included in his main gang are Ducky, Cera, Spike, and my personal favourite the flyer Petrie. Each of the characters have their own splendid personality's from Sarahs pride to Duckys optimism. However the film certainly is not overly cute by any means. The film is plagued with black and earthy tones that give the film a dark feeling. However the main cause of strife in this prehistoric world is the brilliant T-Rex Sharptooth, who haunts the picture and when he appears really is scary. The animation is excellent and carries a certain charm to it, that few films have been able to capture since.

For some reason, that makes me think of racism, and how this may have been the first kid's movie to really deal with that sort of thing up-front and personal. The dinosaur society is really and truly racist, until a group of five kids become friends and bring their families together.In addition to the underlying themes, it didn't seem like much of a kid's movie because even now, as a teenage girl, I was and still am terrified by the fight scenes with Sharptooth and the other dinosaurs. And there was some really delicious humour put in there that still makes me laugh. I first saw this eleven years ago, when I was three, and I still laugh, cry, and gasp with fear in all the same places. It's really a shame that they created all those sequels, though. The first one had such a sense of closure, and then they had to ruin it with ten sequels, each one getting progressively more horrible.

All of his other movies are too saccharine, poorly executed, and have downplayed drama and emotion. This movie also doesn't have the hokey formula Disney started developing around this time. Case in point, this movie, at the time, was competing with Disney's own Oliver and Company. This, in my opinion, is many times better than that. It has a better story, a lot more heart, and no need for fancy songs.

The Land Before Time will always be a classic and there is so much to love in this movie, that even the characters are lovable. I'm going to go through why this movie rocks and will try to avoiding giving spoilers as best as I can.Once you started playing the movie, you are met with great cartoon animation and great music. The music itself is pretty emotional, as it is done by the legendary James Horner. The movie focuses on Littlefoot, a Brontosaurus, who is traveling with his mother to find the legendary Great Valley. Then you meet Cera, a triceratop with an attitude. These two are actually the two of the main characters of the movie, as the rest of the main characters appear after the most heartbreaking scene in the whole movie, the death of Littlefoot's mother, who gave her life to defend him from a T-Rex, but they are called Sharp Tooths in this movie.The acting in this movie is outstanding, as I say the one who did the the best job is none other than Judith Barsi, who voices the main character Ducky. It's also very sad that she was murdered the same year as this movie, 1988. But she leaves behind a great legacy and will always be remembered. The ones that did great in this movie was Gabriel Damon (Littlefoot), Candace Hutson (Cera), and Will Ryan (Petrie). This entire movie was well made and everyone put a lot of effort into making this movie the classic it is today. If they ever remade this movie, I hope they put in the same effort as everyone did for this movie.Another thing that made this movie great is the music. I have to say that James Horner is one of the greats and his music to this is very emotional and can bring anyone who listens to it in tears, as it's very beautiful. The final song, If We Hold On Together is also very emotional and beautiful, sang by Diana Ross. I would always listen to the final song as it is one of my all time favorites next to My Heart Will Go On from Titanic. If there wasn't any music in this movie, it wouldn't have been a classic, as the music gave the story the emotions and brings the movie to new heights.My final thoughts on the movie was this, I loved every minute of this and could watch this back to back, as it is one of the best movies of all time. If you love Dinosaurs, then this is for you. It is also a very good family film, but please be warned, the music is what makes this movie emotional. I would recommend this for kids age 5 or up, but to be honest, any age could watch this, but due to the emotional scenes and the music, age 5 would be the best age to watch this. Your kids will enjoy this movie and remember it for a long time. Overall, I give this 10 out of 10 stars. This is a must see and for an cartoon movie, this is the best so far. I would recommend this over the sequels, as this was the most powerful installment.

It makes me sympathetic towards our main character and I cry every time that scene and a few scenes after it occur. The fact that the 5 dinosaurs that we follow are so young really makes you feel sympathetic when something sad or dangerous happens to them. The ending is by far the best part of this film because they make it to their destination despite hard times.

It is unlike many films, daring to be sad and dangerous (unlike many Disneys) and the reviewer is pleased to say, that this film succeeded rightly in popularity. It also seems that the film is portraying people in a real situation, like a war, but the audience may not feel this way.The film starts with dinosaurs. The audience may expect them to just go about rampaging cave men and a t-rex to be the main star. In fact, this film turns out to show some young herbivore dinosaurs hatching from eggs, a little duckbill named Ducky is the first. Then comes along a feisty and stubborn young threehorn called Cera (short for TriCERAtops). We also see another egg rolling down a dinosaur skeleton and a waterfall and out of it hatches our star a little longneck named Littlefoot.Littlefoot is the only child of his caring and devoted mother. We fall in love with all of the characters and we watch them go through this film of friendship, betrayal and discovery.This is a truly magical cartoon film, unlike just about anything you have seen before.Enjoy The Land Before Time!

First of all, we've got Littlefoot, a long-neck (guess what kind of dino that is!) who lives with his mother and grandparents in a herd, which is separated after an earth shake, and Littlefoot's mother is killed, and he is separated from this grandparents, with only a tree-star (a leaf of some kind) to keep him secure about finding the herd again at their destination and rendezvous point the fabled Great Valley. things never come easy to little dinosaurs on the move, so Littlefoot meets some friends along they way, like Sara, a three-horn (I won't insult your intelligence by telling you what she is), Ducky, (a hadrosaur, she never says the dino-speak version of her species name)Spike, a baby stegosaurus Duck adopted (so baby, he can't talk and he doesn't have plates, but he's a stego.)and Petri (not the dish, a pterosaur) together, they head off on a search for the great valley. Pros- Amazing realism in dino names. no matter how much we want to believe it, dinosaurs would never call each other brachiosauri (the real plural ending of something that ends with us is i) or hadrosauri or anything else. those are derived from Latin dinosaurs did not speak Latin. they would describe each other by their features, like Long Neck or Three-Horns It's original no other movie is like this. sure, the kids travel to a faraway land to find their parents is less original, but the setup of dino society (if you want to call it that) is incredible. great setup. It has Steven Spielberg and George Lucas. I know two other projects that these two collaborated on Indiana Jones and the Raiders of the Lost Ark, and Star Wars Episode III the Revenge of the Sith. all three of these movies rock. Cons This is a perfect movie. the only con is TOO MANY POINTLESS AND INCREASINGLY KIDDY SEQUELS. the original was unsuitable for small children, the newest ones seem tailor made for them. and while the dino names were ingenious in the first one, they're getting so overused and dumb I know 2 kids who use the dino names to describe the dinosaurs.in conclusion This movie is a must see. the sequels are a must not see.

Usually in movies, the requisite is one scene or so of a character grieving, and then the plot must continue on unabated. The Land Before Time managed otherwise. The tragic final scene between Little Foot and his mother achieves a poignancy I can't remember anything matching, and the effect of it is heightened by the fact that it is not simply brushed under the rug for rollicking journey adventures to continue. We continue to feel Little Foot's pain throughout the film, and this fact makes the respites from it he finds in his new gang of friends all the more effective. Admittedly a HUGE amount of the credit for this must go to James Horner for his brilliant score, but director Don Bluth never mishandles a character moment meant to be crucial in this thread.Also, although much of the action is generally cartoon-level stuff, the opening is vastly more majestic and dignified than one might expect in a story such as this, and, combined with Pat Hingle's ultra-dignified narration, gives the film a weightier context than one might otherwise credit it with. The ending only confirms this, with the Great Valley opening up before the dinosaurs as one of the best and most blatant Garden of Edens ever shown on film. The excellent song over the ending credits clinches it even further.This shouldn't imply its a perfect work. There are spaces in between the weightier moments when it lapses sadly into clichés and contrivances, and these deflate with depressing speed some of what the film has accomplished. But certainly not to a critical degree. Don Bluth seems to have made it a mission in his career to avoid playing it safe or being too predictable. I've gone over most of his films in the last few weeks, and I've noticed that he always seems to get into his plots and characters by some unusual route. In films like The Secret of NIMH or Titan A.E., this sort of thing works brilliantly, and even his lesser works (An American Tail, All Dogs Go to Heaven) are at least noble experiments. The Land Before Time is the product of a craftsman at work.

We were on a dinosaur segment, much to the delight of just about every boy in the class including myself. So, this movie was part of the curriculum. I still remember thinking the tragic death of Littlefoot's mother and Littlefoot subsequently wandering alone through the wastelands was pretty sad and quite intense for a little kid to watch. Then, Littlefoot, looking for sympathy, meets the old dinosaur and is basically told that life is cruel, pal. Deal with it. I barely had a concept of the finality and severity of death until I saw this movie...no joke. Not that I wouldn't recommend the movie for young kids, but one should take note for their kids that this is not like a Disney movie, which is typically made from the ground up for kids. Don Bluth usually takes pretty mature themes and packages them in a medium that kids can understand. His movies tend to be quite a bit darker than most animated Disney movies and Land Before Time is no exception.With that intro let me say, having just watched this movie again recently, I forgot how well done it is. It's a very well thought out story that explores many important themes and delivers many deep messages beyond the usually fluffy follow your dream and marry a prince that you often see in kids' movies. This is one of the few animated films that I've seen that really conveys a feeling of anxiety and hopelessness throughout and brings the main characters through very obvious desperation and survival needs. You never really know if all five characters really are going to make it. Some may say, It's a kids movie. They wouldn't kill off any of the main characters! Think again. Take a look at some of Don Bluth's other stuff. He's never been opposed to killing of characters you wouldn't expect...and on screen. Also in the original script, NONE of the dinosaurs made it to the Great Valley; all died along the away. Obviously, that would have been hard to package. However, the film is very harsh and dark until the last 2-5 minutes when all five do in fact make it to the Great Valley alive.All this talk about how dark this film is for an animated kids movie is not a criticism. I think that depth of the film makes it great and I wish more films like this were made for kids. I actually sometimes wished that some of the Disney Renaissance films (Little Mermaid, Aladdin, etc) as good as they are, were a bit darker and harsher in tone. Obviously, I think, especially with a kids movie, you need a happy ending, but that doesn't mean you have to constantly make it fluffy. It's too bad that this film didn't have a greater impact on cinema other than spawning a bunch of direct to video shmaltzy sequels with dumb musical numbers.

High production values, good continuity, slightly rushed pacing, a simple, but firm plot, sufficient casting, good voice acting, great characterization, and all this was achieved in the meager running time of about one hour and ten minutes only. Don Bluth and company really knew how to pull it together, even with two big Hollywood producers breathing down their necks about&#133;everything. Everything fit in the film almost perfectly, with the exception of the pacing. But other than that Bluth and company brought together a truly memorable film of overcoming prejudice, that combined effects of several towards a single ideal is better than a single heroic individual working alone, the themes of the film are highly pluralistic. Another one of the major themes was finding hope in hopelessness. The idea that there is hope of success and survival, despite every that's coming down against you. It is dark moments of need when Littlefoot and the others' inner most strengths really come out. Don Bluth was able to take some very profound themes and put them very well in sync with the action and storytelling of the film.One can confidently say that it is above the average animated children's film. One can also say that it is on par with animated films long since past that haven't been seen since Disney's day. The film is not without it's flaws, though. The meager running time of an hour and ten minutes forced the filmmakers to rush the pacing, and it seemed like they were forced to finish the story as quickly as they could by studio executives.Despite this, the themes of the story and the character development were still woven in effectively. This is probably due to the simplicity of the story, itself a small band of very different individuals overcome racial differences in pursuit of a single ideal, in this case five young dinosaurs lost and separated from their families, searching for a Utopian Great Valley. Pacing aside, everything else in the film was made to be as well as it could, and there was certainly no shortage of budget on this film. The animation, the backgrounds, the effects, the atmosphere, and the music all meshed together beautifully and more than made up for sub par pacing and almost forced story telling at times.So here you have it. This is The Land Before Time, a standing ovation in animated films in its own right. A modern classic film much remembered and still watched by those young and old alike, and was the film to spawn a record setting number of sequels, which are still in production to this day, nearly twenty years down the road from the original's release in 1988.

Anyway, I like this movie, even if it is a little childish at times, it also has some action and adventure, and humor. The sequels to this movie are nowhere near as great as the original, if you ask me; they're even more childish most of the time, and very very repetitive (not to mention that they have a lot of stupid songs; this first movie doesn't have any songs). The original is a somewhat underrated movie that is a classic to me, one of my favorite animated movies.

This movie deals with a quintet of baby dinosaurs, led by a brontosaur named Littlefoot, who have to make it to a fabled valley while fighting off the elements, predators, and even each other.There are only a few things in this film that seem incoherent, mainly why the dinosaurs are capable of speaking perfect English yet they still make up euphemisms for the different species (long neck = brontosaur, three horns triceratops, etc.)  Oh well, not that I'm complaining.The movie can be fairly exciting, but somewhat dull in a few places.  However, all the shortcomings are overshadowed by the excellent animation and strong bond of friendship the dinosaurs all gain.SPOILERS ahead.The movie has a few dark moments in it, particularly the death of Littlefoot's mom by a psychopathic Tyrannosaur while she is defending her son.  That moment will have a few overtones of the scene in BAMBI where his mother gets killed.  I was only eight when I saw this at the theaters, and it was tragic thing to witness.  However, I practically cheered when all the dino tykes sent the evil carnivore to his maker towards the end.  Kinda makes you happy, huh?  (Remember, Bambi not caught up with the hunter who whacked his mom, so sometimes you got to wonder how he would have dished out HIS payback).If you haven't seen this movie, go out and get it!  It's awesome.  I also hear it's better then Disney's recent effort DINOSAUR, so be sure to view this first before you make any judgments on dino films.  This movie will stay with you for quite a while, I guarantee it.  Also, listen closely in the first quarter of the movie for Pat Hingle's character Rooter to mention a circle of life, six years before Mufasa said it in THE LION KING.  Interesting bit of film trivia for those so inclined.8/10  I dare you to show me a better cartoon dinosaur movie.

These simpler Times were none other than the Ancient Early 2000's. Somewhere in the Ancient Early 2000's Long Ago, I still lived in Georgia but I was in Kindergarten, I wanted to be a Paleontologist in the Future due to my most Xtreme Love for the Dinosaurs that ruled our Planet for 185 Million Years, and I never seen any Film before in my entire Life. But then both of those would change forever, when I first saw Don Bluth's very own Masterpiece in all Film Making ever, Don Bluth's The Land Before Time. I will start by talking about the Story which although it is an epic Story it is admittedly forgettable, heck I could never even to this day tell or remember what the Story was about, other than it was about an Epic Migration to the Great Valley, but its saving grace is the Epic Narration about it. I now have to talk about the Animation and Art, which unlike the Story, I will never forget, this might be old fashioned of me but I love the traditional hand drawn animation of this Masterpiece because it is it realistic, detailed, beautiful to look at, intense, epic, and even majestic especially by 1988 standards, the Art in this Masterpiece is well done and well drawn, and even immerses you in this Dinosaur World Don Bluth himself has created. All I ever have to say about the Characters is that I loved them so much I named all Five of my own Pet Ducklings after them. because Don Bluth's The Land Before Time is a Dinosaur Film not to mention the ONLY Dinosaur Film Don Bluth ever made, I of course have to talk about the Dinosaurs and my Paleontological Opinions about them, for 1988 all of the Dinosaurs, and Prehistoric Animals in this, except for Rotter the Scolosaurus are surprisingly all Paleontologically Accurate including the Tyrannosaurus Rex who is not only the right size, but also has two Fingers and not three (unlike two certain Tyrannosaurus Rexes!) the only complaints I have about the Dinosaurs and/or the other Prehistoric Animals are. Spike lacks his Plates, the Baby Triceratops only have one Horn, those and the Pteranodons are too small, but hey Don Bluth's The Land Before Time did come out in 1988 so I cannot complain about, nor get mad at its Scientific Inaccuracies too much, and hey I could show Mercy too, and forgive them, and let them slide. And finally I talk about the Impact Don Bluth's The Land Before Time made and left on me and my Childhood ever since seeing it, well first of all it inspired by to become the Independent Film Going Film Maker Film Animator Film Critic that I am right now and still am to this day, Don Bluth's The Land Before Time inspired me to go see other Films animated or not where and whenever I could, it inspired me to make my very own Films, and it still does even to this day, it inspired me to make my very own Dinosaur Films, which I still make even to this day heck I am even making a Dinosaur Film right now that is inspired by Don Bluth's The Land Before Time, and Don Bluth's The Land Before Time made me respect, admire, and love both Don Bluth and all of his Work he does, but best of all Don Bluth's The Land Before Time inspired me to have a reason to even make my very own Films, to bring the Dinosaurs back from Extinction, and back to Life on Film!!!!!!!! citing "},{"Title":"A Boring Time.","Date":"3 February 2016","Score":"","Genre":"Animation, Adventure, Family","Review":" The Land Before Time (1988) Dir Don Bluth / Voices Gabriel Damon, Candace Hutson, Will Ryan, Judith Barsi, Helen Shaver To a child this animation may strike an adventurous cord, but to an adult it is just a bunch of voice actors whining for ninety minutes.

Now they must band together and try to avoid the jaws of the lethal T-Rex. The plot concept has appeal but it wears thin once it becomes a walking road movie.

Littlefoot the brontosaurus seems to be the leader but his arguments with the stubborn Cera the triceratops get really annoying after a certain point.

Don Bluth claims a lot of scenes were cut out to follow Lucas' & Spielberg's demands, causing the film to have a very short running time. Fans have tried to find these scenes as best as they could, but I think(if possible) Bluth should try to put out an extended cut of this film. At just 1 hour and 9 minutes, it feels like it could've been so much more, and it doesn't help that Universal could care less about this flick and barely ever bother to try and properly restore it, which is why the Blu-ray and DVDs of this film are crap.Judging from the movie we got, the first and (I wish) only Land Before Time is a charming movie to watch that, despite the mediocre home media transfers, showcases the artistic talent Don Bluth has with its gorgeous animation style and breathtaking visuals. Plus, the late James Horner's film score sounds very beautiful. The voice acting is very good, even if it's a bit unsettling hearing Judith Barsi speaking just 4 months after her unfortunate death. As sad as that is, she does a really good job making Ducky so lovable, it's tragic that we lost such a talented actress when she was so young.What I think brings this movie down is its constant narration. I'd love to see a new version of this movie with the deleted scenes restored, along with every part with the narrator talking over the movie to be cut off. Maybe keep the opening and closing narration, but I think the film would be stronger if the narrator didn't talk over scenes that seriously didn't need a narration to it(the earthquake sequence, Little Foot being sad over his mother, Cera realizing they went the wrong way, etc.).Despite its obvious faults, the current version of The Land Before Time we have now is an okay movie that is very nostalgic to a lot of people. I just think an extended cut with almost all the narration scenes taken out would make the movie even better. I'd probably consider it one of the best animated films ever if this were to happen. Plus, we could get a better video transfer that doesn't look like balls...

This is another of those kid's movies I remember from the 80's that seemed poised on the knife-edge of being too dark for their audience but always pulled out an amazing balance . like RETURN TO OZ, NEVERENDING STORY, SECRET OF NIHM etc. there seems to be a delicate juggling act between grownup themes of loss & suffering and the more child inflected ones that seem to mostly get fanned now- cutesy loudmouthed sprites getting up to colorful shenanigans & other juvenilia. Soulless cotton candy. It seems they don't make em like they used to. Littlefoot & his motley dinosaur crew (Ducky, Petri, Spike & lamentably, Sara) embark through a ravaged prehistoric wasteland on their way to the Great Valley, pursued by the tyrannosaur Sharptooth. I saw this movie in the theater when I was 5 & it left its mark. Between the bleak setting & the giant T Rex, the death of Littlefoot's mother is sure to serve up just the right amount of trauma to your little tater tots; what would children's' cinema be without it? Trial by fire I guess. This could've easily swung out of balance; I read they cut 10 minutes of even scarier stuff and while I mourn making a slight childhood favourite slighter, I don't see how that extra weight wouldn't have overwhelmed the exquisite bittersweet balance going on here. It seems just cute enough for its age group & just downbeat enough not to be overly cloying like most of its kind. I mean seriously, it fits the subject matter but rarely do you see such apocalyptic landscapes in an animated movie for the under 7 set. It makes sense that no father to Littlefoot is shown; this is one dreary, god forsaken dinotopia. There should more of this kind of movie, the kind that deliver premature fun but don't condescend & talk down to the audience between colorful Di$nified antics. The kind you're not ashamed to return to years later, hopefully able to finally recognize the point of it all.

Whoops, sorry, wrong movie. When you've done as many reviews as I have, you tend to mix up your movies. But this story does begin very long ago. Long before man ever walked the earth. Before the antelope, sheep, lion, tiger, any animal at the zoo! The dinosaurs roamed the earth. There were two kinds flat-teethed ones who thrived on roughage while the sharp-teethed ones thrived on meat, which meant they usually ate the leaf eaters. The leaf-eaters were heading for a legendary utopia known as The Great Valley, a land of everlasting green plants. The journey would be rough! They only stopped to hatch their young. A Brontosaurus family just had a hatchling. The mother named him Littlefoot because his feet were little. That's logical, isn't it?Littlefoot developed a taste for treestars. His mother told him of The Great Valley and he got excited. The traveling Brontosauruses or Long Necks were Littlefoot, his mother and his grandparents. Littlefoot met a Triceratops, or Three Horn, named Cera. Cera was bossy and highly territorial. Littlefoot was told that three-horns never play with long- necks. Each herd must stay with their own kind simply because they're different. That night, Littlefoot met up with Cera again and they splashed in the water. Suddenly, a Tyrannosaurus Rex or Sharptooth, tried to attack them. Littlefoot's mom to the rescue but unfortunately she was attached by the T-Rex! Suddenly, there was an enormous earthquake that separated the kids from the adults. Littlefoot's mom died, leaving him all alone and sad. Then one day he met a fast-talking swimmer named Ducky then they met a nervous flyer named Petrie. Actually, Petrie couldn't fly. They met up with Cera who caused Ducky to meet Spike, a baby Stegasaurus who didn't talk, just ate. Constantly.       Together, Littlefoot, Cera, Spike, Ducky and Petrie headed for the Great Valley. Sharptooth kept them on the run. Cera kept trying to be the leader. Littlefoot and Cera fought. Ducky, Spike and Petrie went with Cera after that and she lead them to the volcanoes! Luckily, the friends survived and before long reach the Great Valley and are reunited with their families! They live happily ever after.       A pretty good film. It's from Don Bluth who also did An American Tale. George Lucas (Star Wars) worked on this film too! The story kind of relates to Bambi, except here, Littlefoot defeats the guy who whacked his mother. A tragety about this film is that Judith Barsi, who voiced Ducky, was killed before the film's release. She was only 11. How sad. The narrator is Pat Hingle. You may remember him from such films as Batman, Maximum Overdrive, and a few others. The Land Before Time was followed by a seemingly endless line of sequels! There's a total of 8 films in the saga.

Following the story of orphaned dinosaur Littlefoot and a growing band of friends he encounters along the way, it covers a gigantic earthquake which separates the land and the children from their parents. Fleeing sharptooths and further tremors, they try to reach The Great Valley.Quite probably my favourite childhood film, The Land Before Time remains for me a fantastic experience. Bringing as much entertainment to the adult as the child, it is an effective mixture of many key elements. It's plot is an effective one, taking many recognisable types of dinosaurs and throwing them amidst a natural disaster, tearing families and species apart. Containing a wonderful range of great, lovable, and adorable characters, one cannot help but be drawn into its warmth, the cuteness they provide central to the film. Not all is happy and fun, however, with a good deal of real world sadness which lends a great truth to the story. There is a constant sense of danger and uncertainty, blending wonderfully with the happiness and joy the friends find in each other. The darker, and at times unlikeable, character of Cera brings something of a morality and message to bear. To mix with this, Petrie and Ducky carry the best of the comedic offerings, creating two characters which remain in memory forever. Littlefoot maintains the underlying current of sorrow and loss in the midst of the adventure, his pained loneliness an underplayed but essential element. The characteristics of all the characters combine to create a well rounded and effective whole. Particularly, the discussions of interspecies interaction between Littlefoot and Cera is key in offering the viewing children a perspective on racism and its follies; educating as it entertains; enlightening as it thrills.Mixing an entertaining adventure, likable characters, great comedy, and an important sense of dramatic loss and morality, The Land Before Time stands the test of time as a fun and enjoyable kids' movie, working just as well for adults too.

And although I have never seen any of the many lame-looking sequels to this movie, I have seen enough trailers to know that the original is completely different from any of its sequels. And perhaps not in the way you, as a parent, might hope.The adventure begins as Littlefoot, a young longneck dinosaur (as he is so called in the film), goes on a journey to find the magical Great Valley after his all-wise mother is killed by Sharktooth, an evil T-rex. Along the way, he enlists the help of a variety of different kinds of dinosaurs, some of which he was taught not to associate with. Along the way, the fellowship encounter myriad perils, strive, and come close to losing hope, all the while learning the value of friendship, endurance, and tolerance. But a brisk 65 minutes later ... well, I won't spoil it.It's a relatively wholesome movie, with great values for children. It also has some surprisingly stunning animation; the landscape of this land before time comes to life before our very eyes. But a major weakness of this movie is the tragedy and grimness that belies it. One of the major plot points is the aforementioned death of Littlefoot's mother, which causes him indescribable grief, both in the aftermath and along his journey. Furthermore, the entire movie has an overall depressing feel; the landscapes are all drawn in dark, warm hues, and the score has a sombre air to it.The MPAA originally gave this movie a PG rating, but relented to a G after several scenes were edited. Nevertheless, I believe that this movie is not suitable for young children (up until early lower school), and therefore should be considered a PG movie despite its rating. For older children, however, this is a decent Spielberg film that I would mildly recommend.

Really, I did. I loved Celine Dion's If We Hold On Together. That was actually the main reason why I downloaded this movie to rewatch it. That song stuck with me for many years, so I expected that after rewatching the movie, I would feel something, at the least.Sad to say, I didn't. I did not feel anything. I hated Cera (who I thought was named 'Sarah' before). She was just plain stubborn and annoying. The only time when I actually felt something was toward the end, (SPOILERS) when Littlefoot discovered the Great Valley, thanks to his mother's spirit. We also see everyone happily reunited with their families. (/SPOILERS) That's what touched me. The emotions I felt for that scene were intensified and made me wonder more after reading a particular post in the discussion board made by JoshuarayjamesWhat if the kids never actually made it? What if the Great Valley didn't exist, or only existed in their minds, or perhaps as some version of the afterlife? When they first stumble upon it, it's quite obviously just a dead, abandoned stretch of land devoid of life.Is it possible that the kids succumbed to starvation and fatigue and that there never was a Great Valley at all? The ending takes on a whole new meaning then. It's either the hallucination of the dying or the dinosaurs' version of heaven. We all know that the real story of the dinosaurs didn't end with them finding safe haven from the disasters wrecking their world. They succumbed to their fate and passed from history and from life. Disregarding the miserable sequels, does anyone else find this to be a possible true ending?That's the thing that struck me and made me actually think and wonder. Overall, I found this movie quite boring. My favorite characters were Littlefoot and Ducky. I was quite surprised to read that the voice behind the ever-enthusiastic Ducky was murdered when she was just 10 years old! That's so heartbreaking. Who could do that to their own child?Aside from that horrible learning, I also found out that The Land Before Time has so many sequels and that most of them really sucked. It made me think. Maybe the movie that I watched when I was younger wasn't this one. Maybe it was a different one? I remember the dinosaurs on an edge.. And I don't recall anything about a ledge in this movie.. But I do remember that leaf! Maybe it's the same? I have no idea. Point was, I didn't enjoy this movie and was really disappointed.In my opinion, I think this movie is best for the young ones. But if you were a true fan of this when you were younger, you could give it a try to experience some nostalgia. ) "},{"Title":"Labrea","Date":"3 December 2006","Score":"1 out of 7 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Animation, Adventure, Family","Review":" Do you see any Dinosaurs?

Some of the action sequences are hectic and confusing, with one dinosaur battle taking place during a mammoth earthquake (!), but otherwise the picture is rather sweet and harmless. This is probably the closest Bluth will come to duplicating old-fashioned Disney, even if they don't quite have that studio's superior quality down. Some lovely moments, even for grown-ups. Followed by the video-sequel The Land Before Time II The Great Valley Adventure in 1994 and other cheaper sequels after that. ** from **** "},{"Title":"To think I loved this as a little kid...","Date":"27 December 2011","Score":"2 out of 10 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Animation, Adventure, Family","Review":" This movie came out the same day as Oliver and Company. And as a kid, I liked it much better than O&C because I understood the story in this one but not the other as much.Now that I'm older, I decided to watch both films when I learned that this was more successful. I was expecting to feel the same way. But boy did I change my mind. I loved Oliver and Company, it was a real delight to watch again and I'm disappointed that it's become so underrated. But The Land Before Time? Oh boy. I can understand why I liked it as a little kid. It's very easy to follow. But now, as an adult, it's too dumbed down. At times it felt like it was trying too hard to be a dramatic and grown-up story but fell flat.Let me try to explain. The baby dinosaurs hatch at the beginning and look so cute. I was reminded of the opening of Dumbo when Littlefoot's parents were gushing all over him. Only, in Dumbo they give you time to really see the bond between mother and son. In LBT, I thought they didn't give it any time at all. I never saw any affection between the two, just a bunch of really boring conversations. So when the mother died, I felt nothing. I honestly didn't care. Even the death scene was boring. And then Littlefoot meets up with a jerk, Cera, who reminded me of a boring version of Lucy from the Peanuts comic strip. Only she's not nearly as much fun as Lucy. We also meet Ducky, who's okay but not really all that memorable. And Petrie, who is REALLY annoying (when he almost died at the end, I was hoping he wouldn't come back). And finally Spike, who serves no purpose in the entire story except maybe to look cute. They all go through this land and get into adventures and finally find what they're looking for. Yep. That's about it. No depth, no character development (except for Cera perhaps but it seems abrupt), and nothing interesting whatsoever. The music is also repetitive and the end even shows clips from the beginning as if to remind you that you're supposed to feel something. I found this bland and boring.So I think the only reason it's hyped is because it's better than the sequels (but that's not hard to do) and because a lot of people grew up watching it. And while it does have some nice animation, there's nothing going for it. I've heard it compared to Disney but, like I said, I really liked Disney's offering that year. This is just as bland and uninteresting as An American Tail. Typical Bluth, cute but no depth whatsoever.If you're under age 6 or 7, you might like this though. It's easy to follow and the characters are easy on the eyes and mind. But this advice is for little kids. If you're a teenager or an adult, I suggest skipping this one and taking a look at Oliver and Company. You might surprise yourself.

Quite frankly, I found it rather boring. I don't know why. Maybe it was because I didn't see this movie until I started babysitting, so I was too old to be moved by it. Maybe it was because I saw The Lion King, which had a somewhat similar plot, first. Whatever the reason, I just didn't find Land Before Time entertaining.

This is shocking considering both are rudimentary.  Only an idiot could have screwed this up.The first is Bluth's artistry itself.  I never admired his art (read my other reviews of his work for more on that), but this takes the rotten cake for ultimate cheapness.  If Disney had pumped the amount of money and detail as in 'Lion King' into this, the visual appearance wouldn't resemble a crude 80s production.  Even Transformers and G.I. Joe have the same level of detail--totally sickening.The second is the dinosaurs.  While there are a few highlights at the beginning and end, the ultimate depiction of the creatures isn't anything revolutionary...more in line with the stereotypical designs that Disney started and have retained.  Compare what you see here to when Spielberg took the control reigns himself with 'Jurassic Park'.Overall, yet another Bluth work for you and your kids to avoid.  Have them watch 'Wizards' instead; it's an intelligent conceived failure unlike this mess.Final Analysis = = Cinematic Dud "},{"Title":"Bambi before time","Date":"15 June 2000","Score":"1 out of 9 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Animation, Adventure, Family","Review":"  If you find it hard to explain to your child what happens to Bambi's mom in the movie Bambi, then this one won't be any better.

There are six sequels to date. Partially ripped off by the year 2000 Disney film, DINOSAUR, as well. LAND BEFORE TIME has charm at some points. The animation cannot save itself. TIME is choppy in some points of animation. The cast, although has some fine moments, seem more like they inspired the casting for the SURVIVOR reality show with their attitudes.Baby 'long neck,' Little Foot is born and brought up by mom and grandparents. When the food is wearing out, they head out for the Great Valley, where there is more than enough vegetation to live happily ever after. An encounter with Sharp Tooth ends Little Foot 's mother 's life. An earthquake also separates Little Foot and his grandparents. Depression subsides once friends head out with Little Foot to find the Great Valley.Touching at times, especially after enduring the trauma, Little Foot tries to carry on with his life, a leaf the maintaining memory of his mother. But the rest of the cast, save Petrie and Ducky, are not likeable. The animation is what spoils the rest. LAND BEFORE TIME may have started a legacy, but without a good upgrade on the original, this movie should have been fossilized long ago.

This animated film introduces the world of dinosaurs to children. While this film was popular with some of the other girls my age (I would have been nine at the time), I did not watch the film until I was about a year older. When I did watch it, I could not understand what all the fuss was about. I found 'The Land Before Time' to be slow-moving and dull, and it failed to engage me. The majority of this film seemed to be taken up with the four little dinosaurs in dialogue between themselves and in arguments. I would not recommend this film unless you know a very young boy or girl who really likes dinosaurs. Otherwise, do not bother with this.
