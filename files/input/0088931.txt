[{"Title":"About Two-Thirds of a Really Fine Movie and Then an Awful Mess of a Last Act","Date":"23 February 2001","Score":"18 out of 21 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Drama","Review":"  The opening titles for The Coca-Cola Kid make it clear that the film is in no way sponsored by Coca-Cola or the Coca-Cola bottling company. Obviously the company felt comfortable enough with the final product to let the film use their name, but it's hardly a glowing picture of the soft drink giant. In The Coca-Cola Kid, Coca-Cola is the face of American Imperialism. When company trouble shooter Becker (Eric Roberts) declares, The world will not be truly free until Coke is available everywhere, he's speaking without irony. This film, then, is about Becker's attempts to help Coca-Cola colonize Australia, but what starts off as a film of comic promise and originality becomes bogged down in convention and clich√© to the point that it's difficult by the final reel to remember what was so appealing at the beginning.The Coca-Cola Kid fits nicely in the genre of American Corporate Fish Out Of Water tales. If you've seen the delightful Local Hero, for example, you'll know that no matter what kind of tough American goes off to the rural wasteland, he'll change, enlightened by the small town quirks and wisdom he was meant to subvert. That's not really giving anything away in this film, because the last act doesn't play out as you expect. In fact, it hardly plays out at all.Becker arrives in Australia to help boost lagging sales. It turns out that there's a whole region of the country where no Coke is sold at all. Becker, a former marine with the proverbial unorthodox way of doing business, discovers that that region is ruled over by T. George McDowell (Bill Kerr) a gruff man of homespun wisdom, but more importantly, homemade soft drinks, made from real fruit. Even though their first encounter is rough, Becker is determined to fight off the advances of his secretary-with-a-secret (Greta Scacchi) and the hotel waiter who mistakes him for an arms dealer to do the job he was sent to do.Directed by Dusan Makavejev, The Coca-Cola Kid develops a wonderful momentum early on. In fact, the first hour of the film is an absolute gem. Eric Roberts's performance to that point is perfect. His presentation to the bemused Coke officials is comic gold, as he waxes poetic about the fizzy beverage, even holding it up to the light bathing the room in its brown glow. Roberts's early scenes with Scacchi have a nice screwball touch and his interactions with Scacchi's moppet daughter provide a nice depth for the character, hinting at something beyond his intensity. There's a nifty sequence where Becker enlists a studio band to try to come up with the sound of Australia where they go through several absurd suggestions before coming up with a truly catchy jingle.I'm not sure how far it is into the movie, but for me things begin to go south immediately after that recording session. For reasons completely unclear to me, the secretary has Becker invited to a party to catch him in an awkward position. This involves completely random intimations of homosexuality and ends of feeling both forced and pointless. The scene is so clumsy that it leaves a bad taste that begins to spread.It rapidly becomes clear that The Coca-Cola Kid isn't going to omit a single convention of Australian culture. You want an old bushman with a diggerydoo (inevitably misspelled, but my dictionary is letting me down)? You've got it. An adorable wounded Kangaroo? Bingo! And a slightly inbred man singing a rousing chorus of Walzing Matilda? Yup-Yup. In fact, the vision of Australia put forth by the film is so cookie-cutter that it's  hard to feel bad about the culture being overrun by American interests. You support Coke because you figure they're at least putting forth a good product.Eric Roberts's performance finally ends up being a little infuriating because he's not given any opportunity or reason to be anything other than amusingly scary. The film falls apart at just the point you wish Roberts would go through the obligatory character alteration, but there's just no chance. He's stranded. Ditto Scacchi. She adorable and makes the sexiest Santa in the history of cinema, but her character's payoff is weak. Bill Kerr is excellent for the most part, but you can't help but feel that his cagey old Outback Vet is a character we've seen a thousand times.The Coca-Cola Kid's best and most consistent feature is its cinematography by Dean Semler. The Oscar winner (for Dances With Wolves) does what the script and director can't do -- he creates the ironic counterpoint between the Outback, the big city, and Eric Roberts. The film has a dynamic look which, unlike the narrative, doesn't fall apart at the end.I do feel bad about only giving this movie a 6/10, but I guess I should have just turned it off early. Off to drink a Coke...

It certainly put Greta Scacchi on the map.  She plays the daughter of the local softdrink seller, and she's very good, as is Roberts.  The scene where he holds a glass of Coke aloft while describing it in near-poetic terms is great satire.For hormonal appeal, the scene where they sleep together on a bed of white feathers is as erotic as anything I've ever seen.  At the end, when she smiles at him, suggesting a reprise of that scene, the effect is devastating.This movie is full of good scenes.  My personal favorite is the Waltzing Matilda scene, which I'd rather not give away.I was surprised at the negative tone of the other comments.  This movie deserves a look, so check it out.

The promising premise of taking a Southwestern Coca Cola marketing guru to the Outback to sell the locals his universally beloved liquid nectar leads to an intriguing and entertaining culture clash. Less successful, but still whimsically charming, is the pairing of Greta Sacchi and Eric Roberts. While Sacchi and Roberts actually do have some chemistry once they get involved, one is still left wondering exactly what Sacchi sees in the rude and self-centered Roberts initially. The movie comes up with an out-of-left-field explanation which is both jarring and silly; it is one of several missteps in the third act. Another unhappy development is the violent response of the local distributor, which abruptly shifts the tone from oddball romantic comedy to dark drama. The movie goes out of its way to be offbeat, inserting non-sequiturs like the nutjob concierge seeking CIA employment and the homoerotic transvestite interlude. The entirely nonsensical epilogue announcement tops off these quirky for quirky's sake calculations and leaves the viewer rolling his eyes a bit.Still, despite the warts above, The Coca-Cola Kid is a unique and mostly entertaining look at American Capitalism morphing into Imperialism overseas.Roberts is up and down, but ultimately a decent choice as the charismatic and driven capitalist charged with conquering the Aussie Cola industry. Go in realizing this is more a satire than a social commentary and you'll likely come away refreshed, if not entirely quenched. 7.5 / 10 "},{"Title":"Ten reasons why this film is memorable *POSSIBLE SPOILERS*","Date":"23 March 2003","Score":"6 out of 7 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Drama","Review":"  (1) The song (Don't wanna go where theres no Coca Cola indeed).(2) Eric Roberts's manic, amusing performance where he acts like a hyperactive child on valium half the time.(3) Give me churches..schools..houses.(4) Kangeroos being rescued from planes on their way to the vet.(5) The ultra-sexy Greta Scacchi shower scene where nothing is left to the imagination.(6) The super-sexy Greta Scacchi's seduction of Roberts involving a Santa suit, a shoe that keeps coming off and feathers.

The movie should be viewed as a satire of the great American sales and marketing force on the global marketplace.A hot shot marketing guru from corporate is assigned to help sales down under.  He quickly finds a different pace of life and cultural values that he finds hard to adjust to.  He continues on his way even down to the music for a new series of commercials.  He knows his way worked well in the U.S. so it should work well anywhere.Humorous side trips make the journey enjoyable as the guru quickly finds a large area that has no Coca Cola sales.  He goes to investigate and finds a local soft drink bottler has the entire area to himself.The guru uses every gorilla marketing trick he knows to bring the local bottler into the Coke family, but the local bottler resists and even offers Coke a deal.  Coke invades the local's territory and the local realizes he cannot win against the Coke attack.Coke's decisive win costs the company the guru as he finally begins to understand that other things in life, emotions and cultural values, are more important than business wins.I enjoyed the film and recommend it to you, especially if you want to see a funny version of the 60's novel The Ugly American.

Eric Roberts as the gung-ho Coke executive out to undo T.George McDowell's stranglehold on outback softdrink sales is just amazing. The scene near the beginning where Roberts is scanning an electronic map showing per capita Coke sales throughout Australia is brilliant, especially as they get down into the outback areas and discover that not only are Coke sales slim, but in one area, utterly non-existent.Roberts' growing relationship with Greta Sciacci's character and DMZ, played wonderfully by child actress Rebecca Smart, weaves a romantic thread throughout the film, touching us even as we feel the intense need to thwap him over the head and make him see that this is the woman for him.The scene of Coke trucks driven by Santa Claus costumed drivers pouring into T. George's compound is a killer, especially with that jingle (Sung by Neil Finn of Crowded House fame) roaring in the background. I can't understand why Coke has not purchased the rights to this jingle and used it in its advertising. Like another reviewer, I can't get that jingle out of my mind, even 15 years after seeing the movie.

We know that Roberts is an Atlanta hotshot sent to Australia to fix Coke's marketing problems.  We also know he is an eccentric genius.  Roberts' fine acting convinces us of this rather quickly.Unfortunately, the plot is so flimsy, that whatever fine character development has been achieved, it is negated by  voids, inconsistencies, and downright boring film sequences.Usually, I am a sucker for bold and far out plots.  Examples which I am fond of include, Dark Star, O.C. & Stiggs, and Popeye.  Coupled with the fact that I must admit that this film was well acted, it surprises even myself that I cannot recommend this film.The utter breakdown in this movie occurs about midway through the film. All comedy is instantly lost and the film turns dark. Afterwards, the film plods along.  The film's attempt to get the comedy rolling again is not successful. More surprises await the viewer and they are darker still.To be sure, mixing drama with comedy can be a formula for success.  However, with this movie, the result is about as successful as new coke.

(spoilers)","Date":"6 September 2005","Score":"4 out of 6 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Drama","Review":" I started watching The Coca-Cola Kid with the assumption that it would be like other Australian comedies I have seen in which a gung-ho businessman of some sort wants to change a rather dogmatic, traditional industrialist like 'Spotswood' or, in reference to homeowners, 'The Castle.' And true, that is the initial plot in 'The Coca-Cola Kid.' Eric Roberts plays an efficient Southern businessman who plays a key role for the Australian marketing department for the Australian headquarters for the Coca-Cola Company. While trying to assess the markets and potential successful marketing ploys, he learns that there is a large portion of a rural section of Australia that has no Coca-Cola distribution whatsoever and he wants to know why. Enter lovable and genuine old-timer, T. George McDowell, who has his own successful and self-sufficient coke company which monopolizes the area. It is the last of its kind and Becker, who cannot simply fathom any section of the world that has no option of Coca-Cola beverages (he even goes so far to say that freedom cannot be established without global presence of Coca-Cola) intends to compete with McDowell. But, McDowell, used to the frequent visits from Coca-Cola marketing executives who try to make deals (and offer to buy him out?), figures that Becker is another lightweight (at least, initially) and is not ready to give in without a fight. This is essentially the crux of the story, the global company versus the independent.But, the movie takes both an odd and confusing turn at about the time that Becker tries to rain on Mr. McDowell's parade when he shows up at the Rotary Dance with Santa's offering the audience free samples of Coca-Cola. Because, this is about the same time that the story shifts it focus from the main plot to the subplot involving Becker and his eccentric former secretary (played by Gretta Scacchi). Although, I can understand that this is no less essential to the story because Becker, in his involvement with the secretary, is finally pulled from his impersonal role as marketing executive and forced to eventually take on a more humanistic role. But getting there was so weird, and this is especially evident from the sequences where Becker gets drunk and shows up at the drag queen club. And, it is probably Becker's exceedingly weird emptiness that creates such an odd atmosphere and, at least for me, some of the confusion. I don't know if this is how we are supposed to view Becker, or if Eric Robert's strange performance just leads to this. Nonetheless, after slagging through this rather strange and abrupt shift in mood and, eventually, focus, the rest of the film pulls through rather nicely with a somewhat humorous (especially the events involving the hotel bellhop who is convinced that Becker is in the CIA) and ultimately sad ending that makes Becker rethink his situation. The filmmakers offer both a mix of the happy ending and not-so-happy ending (you have to watch it to see what I mean). A pleasant, but unusual Aussie comedy/drama that may be worth your time if you can find it. Just don't go into it with the expectations that it is yet another steadily simple narrative or a typical feel-good Australian comedy.

If he had been given the reign to direct remakes of any films he would have completely changed everything. I could imagine what he could have done with, say, the remakes of the Steve Martin/Diane Keaton/Martin Short Father Of The Bride movies.The Coca-Cola Kid is his most well-known work. The film features Eric Roberts as a whiz kid named Becker who has been sent by Coca-Cola to find out why Coke isn't making any money in the Outback region of Australia. It turns out that a Mom-And-Pop company run by T. George McDowell (Bill Kerr) that has dominated the area. Becker then does whatever he can to buy McDowell out. In the meantime, he strikes up an interesting affair with McDowell's secretary Terri (Greta Scacchi), a single mother who has some ties to Kerr's operations.Much like any Makavejev film, there are some extremely off-the-wall moments. The bedroom scene with the feathers, the drag queen party, the Santa Claus parade and the infamous shower scene where mother and daughter wash up together are some of the crazy things you'll see. Eventually, the movie does lose its focus in favour of its Crash T.V. content. Still, the movie has some good acting, Scacchi offers up great eye candy and it is truly wacky; even if isn't uproariously funny. It's just so out there.

I didn't care about the characters, and some of the comedic subplots or side characters were just boring and stupid, like the hotel busboy who is convinced that the Eric Roberts character is really a secret agent for no reason other than that the movie needed comic relief in those scenes.

There are numerous questionable characters, people that seem to be in the movie simply to provide a momentary diversion from a real plot. It does manage to steer around several bits of stereotyping, such as presenting an Aborigine musician who never flinches at being patronized, even flippantly handing over a business card advertising his services.The visuals are wonderful, including one of the most spectacular sunrise shots across the Outback. The movie does a wonderful job of showing bits of the mixture that Australia is, including a roving patrolman riding a camel, and trying to address the great question - What is the pure Australian experience?. If they had found a way to fill the movie with more of these moments, it might have been far better.I'd recommend this movie for one of those nights when nothing else seems right. It's a decent time passer, but shouldn't be taken too seriously.

After he meets the bosses daughter and interacts with the culture on a one to one basis, he has a change of heart and finds out the things that make life real.  Pretty ho-hum, but Greta Scacchi turns in such an endearing performance as the daughter that this movie is almost worth watching (her body is definitely worth watching).

I know what the premise is about but dam was this movie horrible! Eric is a strong talent in this dark-comedy but I swear that song is the only thing I really liked! I just bought the movie for Eric and that awesome song! The song gets 4 stars but the movie out of 4 star gets a 1/2 star. Love ya Eric but this was not for me!

The kid should get all the support and not be framed for being some kind of Judas who wants money.The movie should be watched by everybody who is male with the same problem the kid was born with, if you know what I mean. I had that birth effect for 17 years before having it removed, though I wasn't exactly tied up like the Coca-Cola Kid. My grandmother had the same name Greta like Greta Scacchi. The church yard where she is buried has the shape of Australia. The spilling coffee part in the movie is the most important turning point that makes the viewer understand something else is going on and the drilling in the wall (hope I didn't say too much).I don't even believe my world map, does that make me a master in economics?I have endured just as much as the Coca-cola kid had, only that is a movie and my life is (at least supposed to be) real. I may have just the same internet as he had and I also have the same difficulty to hold the coffee cup steady,....what's that button?.....if you know what I mean. But don't blame me for being aggressive or beating someone.The Coca-cola kid is an example of what the Englishmen did to the aborigians. Maybe many red haired women are racists?The religious aspects of the movie are really important, without saying too much about the end of the movie. And the denying part and threat of using the phone are really important also in the end of the movie, This movie is more important than a movie to me, the lessons to be learned at the end of the movie, when they settle the score so to speak, are soooo important!I hope I conformed to the guidelines because I want my comments to be read by other people.

So it was lightly plotted, poorly scripted, slightly less than chuckle-at-able, implausible, and limply acted. WHO CARES?

The only reason I am glad I watched it, is its value as a benchmark to rate other movie against it. Finally, I now knew what to expect from the worst ever movie made.  No plot. No comedy. No direction. No purpose.  Nothing. After fourteen years (since I saw it) it still stands holds its place as THE bench mark in this household to rate other bad movies against. "}]
