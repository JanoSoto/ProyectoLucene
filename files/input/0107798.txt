It is well acted, and has plenty of star power, with great performances from Roberts and Washington.  The story is compelling, and the cinematography lends itself to excellent suspense.  However, many moviegoers (including myself) will find elements of the plot confusing and hard to follow.  There are a great number of characters, and it is often difficult to tell who is who -- most of the bad guys dress alike and have similar hair, so distinguishing them becomes challenging.  This may be a minor flaw in either casting or costume, making the characters somewhat undistinguishable.  However, it also makes the plot quite intriguing, as the intelligent moviegoer becomes entangled at guessing just exactly who is associated with who, and so on.  Still an excellent suspense movie -- if you like other Grisham movies (The Firm, the Rainmaker, etc.) you will like The Pelican Brief.  But be warned watch the film in an attentive state, and be prepared to think a lot.  If you are a lazy, sit-back-and-relax type of viewer, this may not be the film for you.

Forget the implausibility of the story.  This is Grisham, the modern-day master of legal and political conspiracy and intrigue.This movie centers on one thing the chemistry between the on-screen duo of Julia Roberts and Denzel Washington.  And they do not disappoint.  Both give absolutely stellar performances, Washington as the reporter who desperately wants his story to see the light of day but is not afraid to let his compassion show through, and Roberts as a terrified law student engulfed in a situation where she is way over her head, trying simultaneously to survive and avenge the death of her lover.  There is not one scene, not one bit of dialogue, verbal or non-verbal, that doesn't make be believe everything they say, and that is a testament to the acting abilities of Roberts and Washington, two of Hollywood's best.For pretty much the entire second half of the movie, Denzel and Julia's characters work together to find proof of the conspiracy that resulted in the assassination of two Supreme Court judges, while at the same time dodging unscrupulous lawyers, heavies and an international hitman.In their final scene together, when Darby is taking the FBI director's private plane out of the country, the bond that has grown between her and Gray is extremely noticeable.  They deplane, and Gray shows Darby the headline exposing the conspiracy.  Darby smiles, shakes Gray's hand, and proceeds to walk to the car that will take her to her new location.... but no, a handshake is just not enough, not after what they'd been through... so she goes back and gives Gray a huge hug, which he returns.  The mutual respect is there for all to see.  No words are spoken throughout the entire scene, they are not necessary.Having read many of Grisham's books and seen all of the movies adapted from those books, I wondered how The Pelican Brief would stack up against all the others in the long run.  In my opinion, it is still the best of the bunch.My score a solid 10.

Roberts pouts too much, and her first meeting with Washington (talking in a weepy whisper) is awful, but there is chemistry between the two and they help gloss over the more nonsensical parts of the script (such as a chase through a parking garage--full of cars but no witnesses--and the ridiculous, fatuous way the writers explain Roberts' seemingly unending credit and cash flow--I have the money my father left me).

It should be used in teaching film - how to construct a story, how to keep the story one step ahead of the audience, making it suspenseful and exciting without having to resort to unnecessary violence or sex to make a movie work.

John Grisham novels will generally make for a reasonably solid if unspectacular film, with just sufficient meat for serious actors to get their teeth into, and the Pelican Brief is no exception to this rule.When two senior judges are murdered, twenty-four year old law student Darby Shaw (Roberts) looks into the case and her suspicions somehow make their way to the FBI &#x96; suspicions that prove potentially damaging to the US government. Now she and journalist Gray Grantham (Washington) must try to stay alive long enough to ensure what they have uncovered is told to the world.Few do distress-turned-determination better than Julia Roberts, but after a slow start followed by a great deal of panicked running and hiding, interest wanes somewhat. Meanwhile Denzel Washington is given so little to do in the first hour to the point he is almost forgotten. Further, it takes so long for us to actually discover what was written in the eponymous brief and for the leads to meet and agree to take action, that the audience's desire to get to the bottom of the 'mystery' is definitely lessened. However, once the two do start working together in the latter half interest does pick up, but not enough to retrieve the film from its ponderous start. Roberts and Washington do the job required of them but seem to treat it as little more than a day at the office &#x96; there is very little of the energy we have come to expect from Roberts, or Washington in particular. The secondary roles are filled slightly better &#x96; John Lithgow in particular a standout newspaper editor, and watch out for a very young Cynthia Nixon (Miranda from Sex in the City) as Julia Roberts' student friend. However, Stanley Tucci as one of a number of shadowy government figures on the tail of the leads should have stuck to the shadows more. There is little of the slickness, the grit and pace characteristic of later John Grisham adaptations such as Runaway Jury.Legal thrillers about corrupt government prepared to kill to save their own position have been done so often (and so often much better) that little feels fresh about this Grisham adaptation, to the extent that were it not for the presence of A-listers Roberts and Washington this film would have long been forgotten. As it is, the film does not have enough thrills to save it from the fate of the DVD bargain basement bin. If you wanted to see this, it would probably be cheaper to buy than rent this film &#x96; and it would make a nice coaster! OK for a throwaway (literally) Saturday night film, but not memorable in any way. It's all been seen and done before.

I can surmise however that from reading other Grisham novels it feels like it might be quite close. I'm sure someone will correct me if I'm wrong.The storyline is fairly straightforward. Why were two Supreme Court Justices assassinated? Darby Shaw, a curious law student (Julia Roberts), does a little research and writes a thesis on a possible reason. She shows it to her law professor boyfriend (Sam Shepherd), who in turn shows it to a colleague, also a lawyer (John Heard), who works for the FBI. The professor is blown up in a planted car bomb and his friend is shot dead in a hotel room. And someone wants the student dead also. She goes on the run, and eventually turns to Gray Grantham, an investigative journalist (Denzel Washington) for help.This is a superb conspiracy movie within the genre of All the Presidents Men and In Defence of the Realm, and although starting relatively slowly, builds up the tension and is never dull. It has an excellent supporting cast featuring Robert Culp as the worried President (what President isn't?), with John Lithgow as Grantham's newspaper editor, British character actor Nicholas Woodeson as an assassin, and Stanley Tucci, who gave such a wonderfully chilling performance as Adolph Eichmann in the British TV production Conspiracy, is equally pragmatically chilling here as a hit man.There is a muted chemistry between the two leads which, like the film, (although there is a little action), never quite gets, perhaps purposely, to boiling point. It's all suitably and superbly played in a low key, which helps to maintain a sinister element to the overall development of the plot.I suspect that The Pelican Brief is probably not to everyone's taste, but I personally love it, and given the oft modern corporate disregard for environmental matters, is by no means implausible, and indeed has the ring of truth about it.

There are a lot of hushed phone calls from people who offer tantalizing bits of information and clues before changing their minds and deciding not to say anything else. Then they are usually killed anyway. They might as well have spilled the beans. I had a hard time keeping up with who got killed and what their relationship to the plot was. They all seem to be bland-looking, middle-aged white men with pudgy tummies and receding hairlines. But I could be wrong about that. Anyway, it's a good thing 'The Pelican Brief' is so sombre and sneaky and foreboding. Once the truth is finally exposed and brought out into the open, it's not terribly interesting. A rich oilman wants to drill for oil in Louisiana. In order to do that, he has to kill a couple of Supreme Court justices so their successors will rule in his favor. Oh, and the brown pelicans of Louisiana's coast will be wiped out as a result too. I don't know, I think if I was in this movie, I'd be one of the bad guys. I'd rather drill for the oil than worry about the brown pelicans. And didn't FDR have a court-packing scheme of his own? Of course, he didn't kill anybody. That we know of. Director Alan Pakula certainly makes the most of what he has to work with here by keeping the suspense level high and by keeping our interest, period. I've read several of John Grisham's books, but this isn't one of them; from the evidence presented here, I'd guess it's one of his lesser works. Denzel Washington plays Gray Grantham (does that sound like a superhero's alter ego, or what?), a Washington journalist, in a quietly authoritative manner. It's as if he dares anyone to question his honor. He is the epitome of journalistic integrity, if that's not an oxymoron. Were it not for Washington's considerable acting skills, his character would simply be too good to be true. He comes to the aid of Darby Shaw, played by Julia Roberts. In keeping with the film's quiet and suspicious nature, Roberts portrays Shaw as smart but increasingly paranoid, which is understandable as she is pursued by quite a few of those middle-aged white men who work for the President or the FBI or the CIA or some oil cartel... I was never quite clear on that either. It is an effective performance. I suppose part of the fun of reviewing a film like 'The Pelican Brief' is poking holes, or attempting to, in the plot's logic. For instance, I found it rather difficult to believe that the aforementioned intelligence agencies and assorted bad guys could not capture or kill the Darby Shaw character. She stays in various motels and hotels using her own credit cards; they spy on her, they tap her phone, but by golly, they never can seem to get their hands on her. She always outruns them or ducks into a crowd or jumps in Grantham's car at just the right moment. I know, this is standard issue stuff for a political intrigue/murder mystery, but it really sticks out here as improbable. It's almost as if they stop chasing her after eight p.m. so she can get a good night's sleep. There is a funny moment too (though I don't think it's intentional) during one of those many hushed phone conversations; Shaw calls Grantham to give him some tidbits of information, and when he tries to find out more, she says, Don't ask me any questions. Grantham gets a confused look on his face and says, quite logically, Hey, YOU called ME. In that moment, he has become a surrogate for the film audience. So kudos to Pakula, Roberts, and Washington for keeping things fairly exciting and interesting almost to the end; 'The Pelican Brief' does peter out as it reaches its conclusion. Still, it could have been a lot worse.

The Firm, especially, was a total mess, but The Pelican Brief is only slightly better.Two Supreme Court Justices have been assassinated. Tulane law student Julia Roberts compiles a brief, which identifies a subtle link between the two which may have been the motivation for the assassinations. She does it as a lark, not realizing that her mentor and sometime boyfriend Sam Shepard would pass it on as a document of interest to contacts in the government. Next thing she knows she is on the run from assassins and attempts on her life, with only the help of idealistic journalist Denzel Washington.The story definitely requires some suspension of disbelief to get off the ground. In the novel, it was possible because Grisham kept the pace nimble and kept the action moving. In the film, the credibility issue stands out like a sore thumb largely because the pace is so sluggish. The lead character of Darby Shaw is so bland that it quite frankly does not seem possible for her to have conspired this brief nor that anyone would consider her much of a threat. Alan J. Pakula, usually a director of some merit, stages the assassinations on the two Justices totally devoid of tension or style. It is almost like witnessing a commercial for insomnia. Thankfully, he rouses himself a bit more later in the film. There is a nice moment where he contrasts Roberts and Stanley Tucci, as a killer, readying themselves for a meeting.The film picks up in the latter half, which prevents it from becoming a complete misfire. Yet, even with that, it still fails to catch fire and does not do justice to its source.Roberts would seem ideal casting, but Darby Shaw is such a cipher that the role fails to give her much to sink her teeth into. Even worse, Pakula has apparently instructed her to restrain her natural on screen ebullience which robs the part of much needed life. It is only towards the end that Roberts really seems to be enjoying herself on screen.It must have seemed like a great coup to cast Roberts opposite Washington, but alas the two have zero chemistry together. With Roberts restrained close to passivity, Washington goes all star turn and fails to connect at all with the other actors or his leading lady. Oftentimes it seems like he is reciting his lines directly to an audience rather than the people in the same scene, an approach that wears thin quickly.There are no real surprises in the story and with a leaden first half, the film falls well short of thriller status. Still, it is a much better effort than Sydney Pollack's atrocious adaptation of The Firm and not as fatuous as Joel Schumacher's The Client. Grisham fans would still be well-advised to stick to the book.

A law student at Tulane, Shaw rounds off her legal education by sleeping with one of her professors (Sam Shepard) and floating a conspiracy theory linking the mysterious deaths of two Supreme Court justices. When Shaw's theory - blaming powerful land developers for murder - becomes circulated in a legal brief, she finds her life turned upside-down. Friends of hers - all having have read the brief - die and Darby goes on the run. Meanwhile, the president (Robert Culp, playing a morally bankrupt chief, less a right-winger than merely in sway of the rich) tries to squelch an FBI led investigation of one of his friends. Tying the mysterious deaths to a top-level cover-up, a Washington Post reporter (Denzel Washington) teams up with Darby to crack the case. They follow the trail that takes them across the country and eventually brings them to the home of a dead lawyer. This has to be one of the worst movies I've ever seen. borrowing elements of more deservedly remembered Alan Pakula movies like All the President's Men and Parallax View, Brief is utterly contrived. It's not as inspired as it is clearly dependent on the cynicism of a jaded public for our leaders and the law. When you look past this flick's slim thrills and its laughable message, nothing left makes sense. The script tosses in a high-priced hit-man (Stanley Tucci) only to dispatch him quickly. Others eliminate their enemies with well-placed car bombs. (We're supposed to believe that guys who are expert in killing people without raising suspicions will rely on big loud car bombs going off on public streets in front of everybody, and of course they can kill just about anybody but a crusading journalist and a law student? We're also supposed to believe that Darby's brief, based on unsubstantiated suppositions, is enough to warrant her death - you'd think that those with power are smart enough to know that most routinely dismiss conspiracy theories for that reason.) Like all so-called thrillers, this one isn't solved - once the story runs out of steam, the script merely dredges up somebody who can explain all. (Brief is typical of modern thrillers populated by brilliant characters who nevertheless never actually do any detective work - virtually all relying on some mysterious stranger to walk out of the gloaming with all of the answers.) Over two hours of overwrought tension aren't enough to match the detective-smarts you'll get in a single half-hour of Scooby Doo. The final insult is the leaden seriousness that Pakula bathes the script in. We not only have to believe this flick, we have to believe IN it. What's impossible to believe is how the Pelican Brief poses any danger at all. You'd think that a cabal of rich right-wingers could afford to do a better job than a law student could uncover. You'd also think that had Shaw been brilliant enough to solve the mystery, she would have been smart enough to realize the danger it posed her - illustrating the modern thriller's other big failing, its reliance on characters who are gifted and brilliant but never all that smart.

It's always a bit spooky when real life follows fiction, although as far as is known, the departure of Rehnquist and O'Connor had nothing to do with foul play or political currents, or did it?In The Pelican Brief, two diametrically opposed Supreme Court Justices, Rosenberg and Jensen, are assassinated by unknown assailants for unknown reasons. Rosenberg was an aging liberal whose days on the court were probably numbered. Jensen was a conservative in the prime of his judicial career. While the first assassination is advantageous to the current sitting US President who we learn is a Republican, the second assassination makes no sense in terms of the first. At a law school near New Orleans, an ambitious young law student, Darby Shaw (played with unending believability by Julia Roberts) is dating one of her law professors, Thomas Callahan (Sam Shepherd). After both professor and student learn of the assassinations, Darby decides she can crack the case. (Callahan had interned with Rosenberg when he was a law student.) While law enforcement believes the assassinations were probably enacted as revenge by a disillusioned losing party in a former case, Shaw decides to research deeper to unearth something political which Rosenberg and Jensen might have had in common. She engages in her own investigation of sorts and writes an essay on her findings, a brief.She passes her brief to Callahan who doesn't take it too seriously. He takes a trip to Washington D.C. to attend the funeral of Rosenberg where he meets a former classmate, Gavin Verheek (John Heard), who now works in the legal department of the FBI. Callahan offers the brief to Verheek who in turn passes into the FBI. The FBI begins believing the brief is a much more serious theory of the assassinations than either Callahan or Verheek had realized, and the brief ends up in the hands of the president.Back in New Orleans, Darby is fearing for her life when tragedy suddenly strikes. She believes the brief has opened up a kind of Pandora's Box and doesn't know who's after her nor whose after some of the people around her. Is it the CIA or another secret organization which has decided to kill her because of the brief? She contacts Washington D.C. political reporter Gray Grantham (Denzel Washington) to help her. The plot then becomes about whether Darby and Gray can confirm the theory of the brief before they are assassinated themselves, like the Supreme Court Justices.A very well-done and spot-on political thriller, all from the mind of John Grisham. Julia Roberts is 100% convincing as Darby Shaw, the-opinionated-law-student-turned-political-target whose brief is shaking the foundations of the political hierarchy at the highest levels. Washington is equally as intense as Gray Grantham, a Woodstein-type reporter trying to get to the bottom of political corruption wherever it festers. A few name talents appear in smaller roles, notably Hume Cronyn as Justice Rosenberg and John Lithgow as Smith Keen, editor of Grantham's newspaper the Washington Herald. A compelling film from start to finish with an outstanding cast.

Roger Eert wrote One thing the movie proves conclusively is the value of star power. Julia Roberts, returning after two years off the screen, makes a wonderful heroine - warm, courageous, very beautiful. Denzel Washington shows again how credible he seems on the screen; like Spencer Tracy, he can make you believe in almost any character. Together they have a real chemistry, so potent that after the movie was over, I heard people complaining that they were never allowed to have a love affair. Any romance would have been rather tactless, of course, considering that the story takes place in the week or two immediately after her lover has been blown to pieces. Maybe with a Grisham story you tend to forget details like that. It is entertaining but don't expect more than that.

The story is similar to what the international oil companies (IOCs) does worldwide. This is particularly true for developing countries where the inefficient government and chaotic situation allows them to go far more than they go in US. The movie also successfully demonstrates the interrelations among corrupt politicians, government officials and the big corporations. However, it depicted an ideal role for the media which is rarely the case. What I believe that, mostly because of the benefits from commercials of IOCs, the media mostly favors the powerful corporations. The most important point is that, while it tells the story, the movie does not bore the viewer. I strongly recommend wide viewing of this movie and then think about the case when the OICs operate in a freer environment. I would also wait for similar movies which speaks about Middle Eastern or Nigerian version of such stories. Happy viewing.

Aspiring law student Darby Shaw (Julia Roberts) has her own theory of why these particular judges were killed and she believes that the killings are politically motivated. Darby decides to write down her theory of what she believes has happened in a document that she calls 'The Pelican Brief' . This is initially done as a sort of 'assignment'. However, when news of the existence of the Pelican Brief gets out, those that are responsible for the killings do everything in their power to get their hands on this document putting Darby and everyone else around her in danger.I wasn't quite sure what to expect from this film as I hadn't read the John Grisham novel upon which this film is based on prior to seeing it. One thing I did, at least expect, was an exciting and fast paced legal and political thriller. The problem with this film is that it moved at a snail's pace and for me was just far too 'talky'. There were good moments in the film and at times it was quite exciting, but it was uneven and felt far longer and far more drawn out than was necessary.As well as being somewhat dull at times, the screenplay didn't make sense at times - I'm still not sure how Julia Roberts knew that the guy in the lift was going to try and kill her (it's possible I might have missed something there as I'll admit that my mind was wandering from time to time due to how bored I was getting with the film). There is also a scene where Darby makes a phone call to Gavin Vereek (John Heard) and asks him to meet her - she's never met him before so she asks him to wear a long sleeve shirt and red cap and asks him how tall he was (this was to make sure that she ends up speaking to the right person). Vereek ends up getting killed and the killer had bugged his phone and recorded the conversation. As a result, he assumes the identity of Vereek in order to kill Darby. I was OK with all of this, but what made me laugh was when he started to put all the clothes on in Vereek's hotel room. OK fair enough, a long sleeve shirt is a fairly generic item of clothing, but a red cap? What the odds of someone having one of those? It just felt a little contrived and a little bit too convenient.The performances from the actors do save the film somewhat; Julia Roberts was particularly good in her respective role. Denzel Washington stars as newspaper reporter Gray Grantham and he helps Darby with her investigations and it is he that ultimately publishes the article which exposes the 'truth' behind the conspiracy. Washington is good in his respective role and his charisma alone is enough in this film.What really let the Pelican Brief down was its dull screenplay; it wasn't particularly exciting or suspenseful and there weren't really any great plot twists. Even the ending felt a little bit anti-climatic. I was expecting a tension fuelled final court scene like we've seen in previous legal thrillers such as A Few Good Men or more recently in The Lincoln Lawyer. The final 30 minutes were pretty good and it's a shame that the rest of the film wasn't as enjoyable. Perhaps part of the problem is that I went in with high expectations - I usually enjoy legal thrillers as they are generally exciting and interesting, but I didn't get that feeling when watching this film. I found large parts of the film to be dull and I also felt that it was far too long. It's not an awful film, but there are far better legal thrillers out there.

They work well individually in this film, and especially in their joint scenes, chemistry of a fashion.Julia Roberts plays Darby Shaw, a smart law student who has stumbled upon a conspiracy that resulted in the murder of two Supreme Court justices. She is having an affair with an older professor (Sam Shepherd), who is killed by a car bomb intended for her. As Darby is forced to go on the run, she teams up with an investigative journalist, Gray Grantham (Denzel Washington), who of course initially is after the news story, but mainly serves as her sole ally and protector in helping her ferret out the plot and avoid being murdered herself by the various government agents and assassins hot on her trail. All quite suspenseful, for me at least. I agree though with comments made that at times the plot is a little confusing and it becomes difficult keeping some of the characters straight. I'd thought I was the only dumb one here; nice to learn there are others.*** WARNING SPOILER COMING ***Engrossing plot typical of Grisham, but for me the closing scene makes this movie. It's so much more dramatic than just having Darby and Gray ride off into the sunset together. The genuine friendship and mutual respect shown at their parting handshake and hug has a drama beyond that which the more predictable romance could possibly have brought. I don't think it's a racial issue either; sometimes friendship just makes a better, more unusual story than a love affair. I'm a bookworm but for once am pleased not to have read the novel, as apparently (according to other comments) the two do get together so to speak, go to bed, have a romance or whatever in the book.

The film stars Julia Roberts as a young law student who stumbles upon a far reaching plot involving the US Government and giant oil corporations. Denzel Washington plays the journalist who helps her get the truth out.It's Pakula's most mainstream, conventional film in this genre, and the film's obligatory action scenes are ridiculously over the top, but the director knows how to conjure up invisible menace, quiet intrigue and the horror of far reaching power. And like All The President's Men, Pakula understands that there is an innate thrill in watching as bookish heroes quietly chase paper trails, track down leads, interview potential sources and piece together puzzles.Unlike many conspiracy movies, The Pelican Brief highlights how blatantly open and public many conspiracies are, and how reliant their formations and dismantlings are on both accidents and chance. Pakula seems more interested, however, in showing how important a sheer force of will is in uncovering conspiracies. His heroes are modern incarnations of noir detectives, intrepidly carving their ways through the murk, flashlights in hand.7.9/10 &#x96; Worth one viewing.

As a result, the screenwriters are faithful to the Gresham's book this time, but this book wasn't as good and is filled with filler material. The movie lasts two hours and twenty minutes, and most of it is just a damsel in distress (Julia Roberts) being chased from one place to the next. A number of scenes could have been removed without taking anything from the movie, and most of the chase scenes are adequate, but nothing more. The story wasn't a bad idea at all, about two U.S. Supreme Court justices who were not ideological allies being assassinated and a law student's theory on the cause putting her life in danger. A good director (Alan Pakula) was chosen to direct and there is a worthy supporting cast. Why does the film feel so ordinary? Mainly because it's overlong and monotonous, and has nothing that hasn't been done better elsewhere. It alters between Roberts being chased by bad guys, Roberts hiding out in secret places, and mysterious bureaucrats mumbling secrets in dark corridors, like All The President's Men with chase scenes. It's no surprise that the film version of All The President's Men was directed by the same director. Because of the big budget, it's proficient in all technical aspects. The locations provide some decent local color. So for all the monotony, The Pelican Brief is painless and and at times mildly interesting, and there are worse ways to pass the time.

Of course her theory has the ring of truth circling it as it passes from person to person, and soon enough she realises that she is in danger from those who want to silence her. With little help from the FBI, she decides to turn to investigative reporter Gray Grantham (Denzel Washington), and there is a big discussion about how the brief could cause problems for an upcoming court case involving official people. The brief is most delicate because it could harm the credibility for the President of the United States, it is not made clear fully who was trying to kill them, but Darby and Gray get out of their situation and everything settles in the end.

In a very tense moment she has the two cornered and spots their reflection in the shiny chrome of a nearby car. Since they are crouched motionless behind a wall looking toward the chrome on the car, and the female assassin has to move toward them, I would have thought they would spot her reflection far sooner than she theirs. How do they get out of this one? Oh yes. A Doberman, conveniently sitting with the window half rolled down in the car next to the assassiness, decides to get excited just at the right moment.

Pakula, the man responsible for ALL THE PRESIDENT'S MEN (1976). The near documentary realism of that earlier film has been replaced by Hollywood gloss and contrivance, as two of Tinseltown's brightest stars follow a trail of clues to their inevitable conclusion. Pakula's own script thankfully refrains from indulging a romance between Roberts and Washington, but there isn't much chemistry between them either, as they rush headlong from one scene to the next, seeking answers to a complex mystery. Unfortunately, the build-up of details isn't nearly as exciting as the film presumes, and the punishing 141 minute running time simply adds unnecessary baggage to an already convoluted storyline. Pakula takes advantage of his lavish budget by staging most of the major set-pieces within large crowds of people, but there are few surprises in either the script or its execution, and the happy ending is never in doubt. On the plus side, however, the film is distinguished by a powerhouse supporting cast of reliable talent (Sam Shepard, John Heard, Robert Culp, John Lithgow, Hume Cronyn, James B. Sikking, Stanley Tucci, William Atherton, etc.). Production values are excellent.

And that suspense was just about the only suspense I got. I don't remember the length of the film, but it felt like well over 4 days, and it was not time well spent. This has to have been the only film I have seen where virtually nothing happened. Julia Roberts was unusually irritating throughout, Denzil Washington's character was hollow and watching it from beginning to end made me feel like I was watching a year-long golf tournament.

The message anyone against saving wildlife like the penguins has to be either crooked or a violent thug is preposterous. Early on, we hear a TV broadcaster proclaiming that the killings of two Supreme Court justices might have been by some group that also bombed abortion clinics, ACLU offices, etc. Of course - villainous right wingers hurting good-guy left wingers - what else? Isn't that the way it's always portrayed in the movies?? Too bad that bias political propaganda is in here because most of this film is just a very good suspense film and well done at that. Washington and Roberts are both fun to watch and they are up against so many suspicious-looking characters that it's a paranoid viewer's delight. They keep you guessing who you can trust and who you can't, which is fun, and helps make the time on this movie fly past.

He gives a copy to his friend Gavin Verheek (John Heard) at the FBI.

Roberts read the book once it was finished and agreed to the role without even seeing a script. I find this amazing as she is woefully miscast as a law student, as she struggles with the dialogue, and lacks any conviction as a believable law student.Made at the height of Roberts popularity and Washington was hot coming off the back of his Oscar nomination for Malcolm X it was a great pairing!! I think if these two made the stinker I Love Trouble (That Roberts followed this up with) that year it still would have been a hit!!

The brief goes all the way to Fletcher Coal (Tony Goldwyn) White House Chief of Staff. Fletcher Coal is concerned that something in the brief will be embarrassing to the White House. Soon after professor Callahan is killed in a car bomb.Meanwhile reporter Gray Grantham (Denzel Washington) working the case from a different angle receives a call from an informant called Garcia. When killers come after Darby, she contacts Grantham.This thriller takes too long to get going. It is too complicated and goes on forever. Based on a John Grisham novel, this movie has no mystery. The bad guys are obviously bad. The case behind all the killers is nothing more than an excuse. As a thriller, it has a few moments. It's just never gets rolling for long. Every time there is a bit of excitement, it's followed by grinding exposition. Julia Roberts is playing up the damsel in distress so much. The crying is really distracting. She's constantly talking in a soft low voice.While Julia on the run is compelling, she does things that seems unlikely. For example, why does she meet her friend Alice in person? Why not just call? Presumably she called her to meet. It's not like she got money for her. She could have told her everything on the phone.And why not tell Grantham the entire story? What's the point of holding back? Presumably he's not part of the conspiracy. Also why not rewrite the Pelican brief? She wrote it in the first place. Couldn't she rewrite it again? There are just too many nagging questions about the logic of everything. I can appreciate the complexity of it all, and a few things will fall through the cracks. That's why real intense rewrites are necessary.Also the bad guys keep being right there waiting for them, bugging everywhere, and yet can't seem to kill them. They shoot at them from far away, but when they're close, they never even try. When a shooting would be so much easier, the bad guy uses a car bomb.

Now how does the state bird of Louisiana fit into the homicides of two of the Brethren? That you have to see the film for.Paranoia is the key word of The Pelican Brief. Julia Roberts is a law student who is sleeping with her professor, Sam Shepard, who once clerked for Justice Hume Cronyn and in fact will probably be his biographer. A little bit of research on Roberts's part into the cases involving these two who were generally on opposite sides on the court gives her what she feels could be the reason and link for the killings. And pelicans actually have something to do with it.I've heard it said that if one could just keep a cool head in a crisis, you can get out of it. Roberts writes her theory up, shows it to Shepard who in turn shares it with a friend in the FBI. Next thing you know he's blown up by a car bomb and she's running for her life. What if they had just ignored her theory?Julia's a pretty woman in real fright and her one source of support is Denzel Washington, an investigative reporter also looking into the assassinations. No romance here, but good chemistry between the leads.At this point with films like The Firm, The Client, The Rainmaker, John Grisham's books have a pre-sold audience. But that also places a big responsibility on the players who have to live up to the Grisham characters that his readers have come to know. I can't see how he could complain about Julia, Denzel and the rest of the cast of The Pelican Brief.I'd pay attention also to Tony Goldwyn who in the Nineties was making a nice name for himself in villain roles like in Ghost. Goldwyn plays a really creepy White House aide to President Robert Culp. The kind of man who would have found a home with Richard Nixon. Culp's pretty good to as a president like Nixon, who has a nice scandal bubbling up around him. A film made from a John Grisham novel with a great cast of players. What's not to like?

Denzel Washington is a news reporter who Roberts contacts for help and he does his best to protect her from the powers that be who want her dead and the story suppressed.

It's not nearly as interesting as `The Rainmaker' and not such a good action yarn as `The Firm' but is prettier than both, with good use being made of New Orleans as one of the major locations. Denzel Washington as Afro-American ace newspaper reporter Gray Grantham and Julia Roberts as Darcy Shaw, a beautiful WASP princess law student, are very good together and I longed for racist sensibilities to be outraged by their characters having a good old bonk.They get it together at the end of the book, but alas, in the film they do not. In the book though, unless I've missed something, Gray is not specifically Afro-American, though he cultivates his own Afro-American Deep Throat (a White House janitor).I quite enjoyed Sam Shepards' randy drunk law professor who has fallen in love with his beautiful student Darcy. He's very improbable yet quite convincing. What she sees in him is harder to figure, but he is disposed of early on. Most of the other characterisations are stock standard &#150; the dimwit President (an amalgam of Ford, Reagan and Bush senior), the conniving presidential aid (most of the Nixon White House), the straight arrow FBI director (maybe not so stock standard) the laconic, not to say taciturn evil hitmen, the tough but supportive  editor (John Lithgow rather good as a Ben Bradlee type). As in `Three Days of the Condor' the great liberal press saves the situation and the crooks are brought to book (well, some of them) despite the machinations of the White House and the CIA. There's not an original idea in the film but Alan Pakula puts everything together quite well. It's not a patch on Pakula's `All the President's Men', but it's hard to hate a movie aimed at trying to save the Louisiana Brown Pelican. Remember the rhyme? `What a wonderful bird is the Pelican; for its mouth can hold more than its belly can.'

But it's high stakes Washington politics that can be interesting regardless, and it has the innocent individual on the run from danger that can sustain even a bad plot.But this is a good one, raging from New Orleans (ever partying), to New York to Washington. Director (and producer, and screenwriter) Alan Pakula has a slightly breathless, slightly superficial style to his filming that gives routine Hollywood the doldrums, sometimes, but even so, he has a slew of impressive films to his credit, including the most subtle and original of them, his first, Klute. But check out Parallax View, too, for a curious film (nothing deep, but very clever). For a more chilling plot, Sophie's Choice, based on a book by John Fowles, a more slightly more probing writer than the man behind The Pelican Brief, John Grisham.

I would say this is on a par with those movies, and is typical of the mass market thriller genre. For me it's like watching TV, or an airline movie the treatment is predictable, the plot includes a lot of unlikely action morphed out by various CIA, FBI, and other serious types according to the general expectation of the audience on a simplistic level, with some creativity but certainly nothing original. This is a movie for a tired CEO to fall asleep to. Yet it stars Julia Roberts and Denzel Washington with an interesting cast that includes the very talented Sam Shepherd. Alan J. Pakula, who directed and penned the script from Grisham's novel, has a number of important movies to his directorial credit including All the President's Men (1976) and Sophie's Choice (1982), and some as a producer, most notably the celebrated To Kill a Mockingbird (1962). So what happened here?Just the usual gravitation toward the mean. If you make a movie aimed at a mass audience, what's the point of doing anything they wouldn't appreciate anyway? Roberts and Washington are here for their star power, not because of their considerable acting talent. Yet, perhaps inspired by one another, they both give strong performances that carry the movie and make this definitely worth watching.Julia Roberts plays a Tulane law student who gets an idea about who assassinated two Supreme Court justices and why, and she writes a brief about it, the Pelican Brief. We see her deep in the stacks at the library doing research, sporting several hair-dos at a little table under various lighting changes, so that we know its daytime and then night, etc., a clear device about as original as the pages flying off a calender. Tulane law professor Thomas Callahan (Sam Shepherd) is her mentor and bed mate. She's twenty-four and he's about forty, but a girl can learn a lot from such a man and he's warm and loving. Nonetheless we are scratching our head about this match up, especially when he begins drinking heavily (one of the justices was his mentor), and we know now for sure he's not in love. Well, the guy that gets Julia Roberts sure as heck can't be wishy washy about his love for her, we know that.We are also scratching our head because Denzel Washington, the ace of spades of leading men, an actor of power and accomplishment, is usually found in more serious venues, a guy who's played Steve Biko, apartheid victim and martyr in Cry Freedom (1987) and Malcolm X in Malcolm X (1992). So what's he doing in this mid-brow flick? He plays a beltway reporter, right out of the annals of the Bernstein and Woodward legend, but there is little real acting for him to do. So why is he here? It's to play opposite Julia Roberts of course! So what we have here is a very expensive entertainment starring two real actors. (I wonder how much money it made considering what they had to pay Grisham, Roberts and Washington.) Surely the subplot has to be romantic. How IS Hollywood going to play the racially mixed duo? Inquiring minds want to know. (Hint with great subtlety.)Julia is running, since the bad guys are after her. Notice that the plot conveniently gets rid of the too old for her guy. Try not to notice the other contrivances, the mysterious guy in the background who appears at exactly the last moment, for example. Just as one of the bad guys is about to blow our Julia away, he somehow blows the hit man away--by the way, getting blood on our girl. (It's enough to mention one plot contrivance per review, unless it's unusually bad, but there are others.) Well, Julia's getting the picture and it's pretty scary. She's on the phone as she's running from hotel to hotel, spending cash instead of using traceable credit cards. She can't trust anybody. Even the president of the United States is suspect, played incidentally with a kind of glee by Robert Culp as though impersonating Ronnie Reagan halfway into his dementia. Strange thing, Julia actually thinks you are supposed to really ACT in a thriller! Denzel knows better, managing a kind of controlled emotion throughout, saying as little as possible, using his eyes and making a lot out of silence, which is something an accomplished actor does when the script doesn't give him sparkling lines. Julia really does look scared, her face rubbery with a mean crease down the middle of her forehead. Watching just her, one could mistake this for an artsy-smartsy serious flick. Not to worry. There are some nice explosions and plenty of chases and all sorts of shadowy red herrings lurking about.Bottom line If this is your genre, and you've just got to get away from that pile of papers you brought home to work on, go for it. This is standard issue escapist fare, true, but the stars really do shine.(Note Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!

Pakula who also adapts the screenplay from the novel of the same name written by John Grisham. It stars Julia Roberts, Denzel Washington, Sam Shepard, Stanley Tucci, John Heard, John Lithgow and Tony Goldwyn. Music is scored by James Horner and cinematography by Stephen Goldblatt.When two Supreme Court justices are assassinated, Tulane University Law School student Darby Shaw (Roberts) writes The Pelican Brief, her theory on what is behind the killings. After showing it to her law professor lover Thomas Callahan (Shepard), it sets the wheels in motion for more murder and political intrigue, with Darby right in the middle of it and in fear for her life.Ah John Grisham, he was just like Michael Crichton, authors who for a while seemed the hip guys to read and therefore became ripe to have their works adapted into movies. Of course this in no way was a measure of quality, where just like some of the Crichton adaptations, Grisham's literary transference to the big screen hasn't always proved to be critically successful. Sure, star casting and big amounts of studio cash driving them forwarded have ensured considerable box office returns (Pelican Brief made close to over $140 million in profit), but audiences have remained indifferent towards the visual tales of legal eagles in peril.The Pelican Brief is quite frankly too often dull, a simple story is made to look over complicated by filling it with secondary characters that just come across as superfluous. The lead protagonists lack depth and development and long passages of dialogue feel like padding that just stretches the running time to the over long 140 minutes run time. Pakula (is this the same guy who crafted All the Presidents Men and Presumed Innocent?!) slow burns it in a way that we expect a big rousing pay off, yet the finale is one big anti-climax. Leaving us with a sort of oh, is that it? feeling.Another major problem is the casting of Roberts as Shaw. Although unfairly thought of in the 90s as rom-com fodder (being good at it doesn't make her a bad actress), Roberts lacks the range to really bring Shaw to life, to hold the film together with a detailed characterisation. This leaves Washington (as political reporter Gray Grantham) straining to hold the core coupling together, which he does, manfully, but even his efforts can't lift the human interest part of the narrative to exciting heights. While elsewhere it all feels routine from the director and Horner at times thinks he is scoring an Arnold Schwarzenegger movie, which of course doesn't fit.It's not a total wash out, there's a fine ensemble of actors to appreciate and those with a legal/political bent are sure to get something from the plotting. But this should have been much better, more brainy and for sure more exciting, as it is it's a over long bore that wastes talent and premise in equal measure. 5/10 "},{"Title":"Intensely engaging and suspenseful","Date":"7 November 2008","Score":"0 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Crime, Drama, Mystery","Review":" This film is about a law student uncovering a huge conspiracy that involves the assassination of two judges. After her brief gets into the hands of the FBI, she becomes the focus of assassination.Making a suspenseful thriller is not an easy task, but The Pelican Brief does the job. The plot quickly develops into a myriad of conspiracy, deceit, murder and paranoia. The constant surveillance, chase and murder is engaging and scary, these really kept me on edge throughout the film. Darby Shaw's well justified paranoia is intense and suspenseful, I really feel her fear and desperation. There were so many times I shouted danger to warn her, or shout don't! to hope to save her life. The plot is suspenseful, and it makes me want to find out what happens.The Pelican Brief is intense and engaging. I look forward to watching other John Grisham adaptations in the future.

Pakula (Presumed Innocent).As in the Sydney Pollack film The Firm, The Pelican Brief requires concentration and attention to detail as it relates the story of New Orleans law student Darby Shaw (Julia Roberts), whose theoretic paper, which outlines what she believes to be the reasons behind the brutal assassinations of two Supreme Court judges, lands her in hot water when it passes into the wrong hands. Her brief, it would seem, is much too close to the truth for comfort. So begins a frenetic chase as Darby runs for her life whilst she searches for someone in whom to place her trust. She finds that confidant in Washington Herald reporter Gray Grantham (Denzel Washington), whose determined yet ethical pursuit of the truth is both admirable and effective.Grisham's involved novel (which probably loses much specific detail in crossing to the big screen) gives the movie a plot that is fascinating enough to carry proceedings alone, however Pakula's effective direction and his choice of two popular stars does no harm to the cause. Both Roberts and Washington are in good form and give strong performances, as do the impressive supporting cast.A most enjoyable, and occasionally tense, thriller whose beginning and finale are both far outdone by the fast middle.Sunday, March 27, 1994 - Village Doncaster "},{"Title":"A great picture!","Date":"15 January 2005","Score":"0 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Crime, Drama, Mystery","Review":" A minimum of violence, a minimum of special effects, a maximum of good acting. Denzel Washington and Julia Roberts play very well together. The suspense is tangible, but low-key, which makes it all the more suspenseful. One of Grisham's better stories, it shows his unhappiness with lawyers. I got the feeling from Julia Roberts that she was not acting, but that she was really involved with the Pelican Brief. It's not an action movie, but a potent movie. In light of today's politics, it is rather noteworthy. The photography is excellent, which contributes to the picture.

In The Pelican Brief, supemely talented New Orleans law student Darby Shaw (Julia Roberts, in full pout and doe eyes) solves the mystery of who assasinated two Supreme Court justices after a few all-nighters in the law-school library.  She shares this info with her lover and professor, Thomas Callahan (Sam Shepherd, looking good!), who shares it with a friend at the FBI.  Soon everyone who knows about The Pelican Brief (Darby's novel title for her thesis; whatever happened to titles like Doe. v.

He checks out her story and soon they are both are on the run, relying on all the tools of spycraft they picked up from previous John Grisham novels, no doubt.If the pace of the movie had been faster, the viewer might not have had time to think of all the implausibilities of the plot.  But it clocks in at 215, when it has enough material for a tight 130.  However, the photography and scenery are nice but those late '80s women's clothes suck!

Pakula has created another exceptional looking political thriller that, at least, in terms of visual style matches his great earlier work- (Klute, The Parallax View, All The Presidents Men, Rollover). Unfortunately, the script based on a John Grisham novel is one of the weakest of his career. The premise of a conservative capitalist conspiracy to assassinate members of the supreme court is certainly credible, but, it doesn't quite translate into a 140 minute film. The remarkable look of the film is so remiscent of the director better work that the audience keeps waiting for richer character development. We only find this development during the first half hour of the film especially with the rich character of Thomas Callahan (very well played by Sam Shepard). Once we get into the action part of the film things get much more standard and morally clear- a real let down for fans of Pakula's excellent Klute or The Parallax View where the tension is created as much by the character's insecurities as it is by the actual physical threats against them. Pakula is a marvelous director of actors and this remains true here- Denzel Washington does fine sturdy work here in what is really a supporting role as Gray Grantham, a Washington reporter who comes to the aid of Shaw. Washington shines here and he virtually overwhealms the film. Julia roberts is adequate as the protagonist, Darby Shaw. Actually I wish that Cynthia Nixon, who has a small role would have been cast as the lead. Nixon is a brave, complicated actress and could have gone deeper places then Roberts. As noted before Sam Shepard does some of his best film work here and there is also nice work from John Heard, Stanley Tucci, Robert Culp and Jon Lithgow. However, it is the films cinematography by the gifted Stephen Goldblatt that makes me recommend this film. Goldblatt works here in beautifully composed low lit scenes. Some of the night scenes and scenes in the Oval office are so remarkably well photographed that the inadequacies of script disappear. The art direction and  set decoration are equally sublime throughout the film using a muted color pallete throughout most of the films- that contrasts sharply with the vibrant colors of the beginning and end "},{"Title":" Best of the Grisham-book based films.","Date":"17 January 2002","Score":"0 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Crime, Drama, Mystery","Review":"  Bought a copy 5 years ago and have watched it 25-30 times.

'The Pelican Brief' is extremely well handled. It has a slow, almost beguiling, plot development. But the quality of direction and the acting of its two leads seldom lets the story flag. It runs for well over 2-hours, And this gives Alan J Pakula, the director, plenty of time to realise his work without any botched haste. Here; strange-faced Julia Roberts plays the law student with an eye for conspiracies, Darby Shaw. When a couple of Supreme Court Judges get bumped-off, her published speculation falls into the wrong hands. Pretty soon Ms Shaw is also in the firing-line. She narrowly escapes a car bomb and, realising that she's been marked, goes on the run. Denzel Washington plays investigative journalist Gray Grantham. He becomes her confidante when all the other people she contacts get wasted. Beginning with wary suspicion, their relationship develops into one of mutual trust and respect. They are both fine actors and each gives a thoroughly believable presentation that doesn't descend into the usual trite and hammily predictable romance. The more these two begin to unravel her conspiracy, the more they become entangled in it. There are wonderfully observed moments of tension along the way. I particularly like the 'man in the wardrobe' scene, where his presence is barely hinted at as the mirror-door just opens an inch or two. You don't notice the door open so much as the reflection shrink. It's a very nicely observed little detail. Suddenly it becomes a life-or-death race in a multi-story car park. Again, the director makes use of another sly trick of reflection. These small details seem to hark back to an earlier, more intelligent age of cinematography entailing the likes of Orson Welles or Hitchcock. There is little in the way of pyrotechnics. A couple of cars explode. Bloody moments are equally low-key by most of today's standards. They're as gross as a good thriller should be. Short, shocking and rare. The ending is uncluttered by excessive schmaltz. Most of the villains are caught. The FBI get on the case. Ms Shaw disappears with their assistance. The hinted romance is still never more than a hint.A very strong and believable supporting cast of American character actors like John Heard and Robert Culp give the movie an additional stamp of plausibility. Editing is unobtrusive. Lighting and sound are as good as you could wish for. It's technically very competent.If anything; the conspiracy itself looks a little far-fetched. It seems highly unlikely that a top-flight law firm would engage in assassinations. It also seems equally unlikely that there would be 'people surrounding the president' who would 'stop at nothing' in order to see him re-elected. I can't imagine anyone risking a stint in the electric-chair - or whatever - in order to advance the political careers of the sort of shallow dimwits who find their way to the oval office these days. Perhaps in 'tricky dicky' Nixon's time, but not since. However, bent lawyers and homicidal political aides are standard Grisham fare.It's a nice movie though. And the 2-hours-plus hold your attention easily. It's what 'Enemy Of The State' should have been, but for the OTT acting, pyrotechnic overdrive, and self-indulgent violence. More brains than Brawn.Highly recommended.   "},{"Title":"Well acted and suspenseful scenes, but lacked a plausible conspiracy.","Date":"17 January 2004","Score":"1 out of 4 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Crime, Drama, Mystery","Review":"  The Pelican Brief was well acted, contained great scenes of suspense during the action scenes, but lacked a plausible conspiracy scenario.

He fit naturally into this role,most of his movies he makes his character stand out. he did a wonderful job in this movie. his costar however did not do that great,Julia Roberts is a cheap actress. her use of vocal tones high or low to show her mood-kept reminding me that i was watching an actress pretend to be someone.she really doesn't do anything special. there are a lot of actresses that when i see them on screen- i don't even remember their name-but i can remember their character's name.my only wish is that IMDb was in operation at the time of this films release, because the plot is also poorly thought out. OK here it is- someone that once worked for someone-wrote her theory on a political assassination - hmm that has happened every day since the beginning of the American political machine. to this day theories of political conspiracies are written and swept under the rug as often as people pour a cup of coffee. yet there are no government goons in the shadows-waiting to kill you. when i first saw this movie i would have given it a 8 or 9 but because i have seen it more than twice a year for the past ten years i knocked it down to a 3, and mainly because of a poorly thought out story line that gets old, and the older it gets the more unbelievable it becomes.throw a cheap actress like Julia Roberts into the mix and it is almost horrible. i could never understand what movie viewers saw in her, but i never did or never will see anything in her. I think Denzel Washington is the only one that made this movie come together. so my advice- is watch this movie only if you get it for free. but if you like Denzel Washington it might be worth watching, however be forewarned that you have to watch the other garbage.
