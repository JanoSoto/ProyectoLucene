[{"Title":"As important move about the American spirit as there is","Date":"14 April 2002","Score":"54 out of 56 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama, History","Review":"  This movie was obviously made as a labor of love, by someone whose ideals are deeply American. Director Sayles masterfully documents the nuances of the ageless conflict between those that would control others for profit and those that would not let themselves be controlled and thereby captures the essence of a battle that still rages between the American ideals of freedom and free enterprise.Historically, the film documents a victory (some say massacre) by the miners over the power brokers and thugs of the early 20th century coal mining industry. Taken in the overall context of the history of Appalachian coal mining, however, what it truly documents is one battle in a war that was eventually lost when the government once again came down on the side of commerce as opposed to human dignity at the battle of Blair Mountain.Fortunately for us, Mr. Sayles seems all too keenly aware of the tremendously important under-currents of this historical event. Rather than merely documenting the conflict and violence of this historic event, he artfully imbues the story with human elements of betrayal, regret, loss, resolve, and ultimately, sacrifice in the name of what is right and just. He reminds us that righteousness often comes with a price and that the real war is never won or lost but rages on forever, claiming the salvation and damnation of souls in it's wake.This film is a masterpiece and deserves its due. It represents everything good about film-making and should hold a special place in the hearts of all free Americans aspiring to the ideals expressed in our constitution.

Is the Academy afraid of John Sayles?See Matewan for its wonderful portrayal of the events that occurred in West Virginia in the 1920's. See this film for its phenomenal cast.  See it for its beautiful cinematography.  There is an ethereal glow that envelopes the characters and buildings of Matewan.There is also an underlying allegorical depiction of Christ and his followers.  Chris Cooper is a saint.  He reminds me of Gary Cooper a little bit.  He has such an unusual handsome face.  He is the protagonist joined by James  Earl Jones, Mary Mcdonnell, and Will Oldman.  Perhaps the most fascinating character is that of the Sheriff portrayed by Strathairn.  He is the angel on the black horse who carries with him the wrath of God.  Just watch him stand up against the bad guys.The main antagonistic characters are pure evil.  They terrorize the inhabitants of Matewan with juvenile antics.Please see this film and be prepared to have it imbedded in your mind for the rest of your life.

Ferociously independent --most of his films are made with privately organized funds-- and working with what has become a repertory company --most of his actors return to work with him for less than they would get elsewhere-- he has never made an uninteresting film. Even when his films may vary in overall quality, from merely good to great, they are each interesting and arresting.My mother was an organizer in the southwest coal counties of West Virginia, arriving there in 1926 (having left college), near the end of the coal wars. Her only comment on the film, when I screened it for her before she died in 1988,was that the working conditions and the living conditions of the miners and their families were far worse than depicted in the film. She always spoke at union meetings surrounded by a body guard of 10-20 armed miners. A number of her young colleagues were assassinated (there's no other appropriate word for how they died). The murder of Sid Hatfield, the town sheriff of Matewan, in the year following the year portrayed in the film, in broad daylight on the McDowell County courthouse steps precipitated the largest insurrection in the U.S. since the Civil War. More than 10,000 armed miners from the six coal counties, descended on the court house looking for the private detectives and law enforcement officers who were the assassins. They took over the court house and the town, and threatened open insurrection. Thew film is a great film. Unfortunately, like most of John Sayles's films, it did not play to a large audience.

The mine owners are equally determined to prevent this from happening.     John Sayles is a truly admirable film-maker.  For three decades now he has been making intelligent and eminently watchable movies, turning down Hollywood's money in order to preserve his artistic independence.  He often takes a small acting role in his films - and acquits himself more than competently.  In Leanna he played the predatory college lecturer, and here he is the 'hardshell' baptist preacher.  He gives quite a performance.      West Virginia's misty greenness and steep, wooded slopes are evoked beautifully.  The shabby rail depot where the shoot-out takes place is a genuine West Virginian location.  The feel for both period and place is created with loving sensitivity.   Director of Photography Haskell Wexler has done a great job (look out for the terrific train shot).  There is a persuasive grittiness and realism about all of the images, and especially the climactic gun battle, that is utterly absorbing.  The music which accompanies the action contains authentic vernacular songs, in perfect keeping with what is in essence a true story.     In the first years of the twentieth century, mine workers in West Virginia lived in abject poverty.  Subjected to the 'truck' system, they were paid, not in cash, but in company credits.  They had no choice but to spend their wages at the company store, where the mine owners dictated the prices.  On top of this, each worker was obliged to buy his own tools and to pay for wash-house facilities.     Into the community of Matewan comes a saintly stranger, Joe Kenehan (played by Chris Cooper).  Kenehan is a deserter from Levenworth, a conscientious objector who has taken to the creed of socialism with almost religious fervour.  Sent by the union as an emissary, Kenehan's task is to win the confidence of the people and to educate them in the ways of organised labour.     If Kenehan is a symbol of enlightened socialism, 'Few Clothes' Johnson (James Earl Jones) represents the true working-class hero.  Few Clothes understands mining more deeply than his bosses ever will.  Though he is now in his 50's, his fine body remains immensely strong.  This good and gentle man does not like violence, but he will fight to protect his people against their natural enemies - the agents of the mine owners.     Sayles' first-class screenplay cleverly exploits the religious imagery which suffuses the language of these simple, God-fearing folk.  The film makes the point that the 'getting' of socialism is a form of religious conversion.  Kenehan is a wandering missionary, rather like a biblical prophet, preaching the salvation of collective bargaining.  He is an alternative to the preachers, bringing Revelation to the miners, puttin' the spirit into 'em.  Little wonder that Bridey Mae Tolliver (Nancy Mette), the would-be seductress, is seen by the locals in terms of the Old Testament story of Joseph and Potiphar.     The tale is narrated by Davey, the boy preacher whose sheer humanity draws him into the workers' fold.  In this wilderness west of the Shenandoah Valley, two broad movements have developed within the baptist faith - hardshell and softshell.  The hardshell preachers dispense a strict, unyielding brand of christianity which is unsympathetic to the miners' cause - after all, there is the parable of the toilers in the vineyard.  Davey is a softshell preacher, a believer in the brotherhood of man who interprets Christ's message as an exhortation to kindness.     And then there are the Italians.  The immigrants speak little English, do not integrate and are (initially, at least) indifferent to the nascent union agitation.  They are exploited by the mine owners as unwitting strike breakers.  It is through the womenfolk that the antipathy between Americans and Italians is overcome.  At first, the women are every bit as hostile towards one another as the men, as shown in the clashes between Rosaria and Mrs. Elkins (Maggie Renzi and Jo Henderson, long-time collaborators with Sayles).  However, the great dramas of human life - birth, mourning, and the never-ending struggle to feed their families - draw the women together.  The workers realise that far more united them than divides them.  I figure we're all in this together.  The Italian miners join the strike.     Hired vigilantes have arrived in town, company men with the express intention of breaking the strike.  Their ugly presence sparks trouble, and the escalation of tensions begins, leading to gut-wrenching violence.  This tension is superbly conveyed in the scene where the night shift of strike-breakers enters the mine.       At one point, semi-wild hillfolk intervene to drive off Hickey and Griggs, company vigilantes who are terrorising defenceless miners.  Sayles' point is that the true Americans know instinctively where right and wrong lie in this conflict.  They are the natural allies of the miners.     Sid Hatfield, the law officer of Matewan (played by David Strathairn), is a good man in the great tradition of lawmen.  He sees his vocation in simple, powerful terms - to protect his people.  When the final confrontation comes, the choice that he makes is one of the most stirring events in a film charged with emotion.

Probably hasn't grown much. I still keep in contact with a few people from there.

I've heard stories of how the real Matewan Massacre went, along with Bloody Mingo and all the rest, and from what I've heard from my family, this movie is pretty close to the truth. Matewan has always been a rough town, and even today fights are commonplace in this little one street town. It's pretty desolate, with no real business, no industry, and the coal mines are almost mined out. The nearest decent place is Williamson (WV) or Pikeville, Kentucky, a small college town. I miss home sometimes, but at least I can watch the movie and be reminded of home. One thing about it... it's an entertaining movie. Hope you enjoy it as much as I did, but then again, I'm biased.

It accurately portrays the manner in which powerful industrial interests manipulated the worker's economic dependency using 'script' issued in lieu of lawful and legal tender and controlled the acquisition of basic needs such as shelter, food, and clothing. By owning the stores, controlling employment, threatening the physical well-being of its employees, and hiring of thugs to intimidate individuals and their ability to implement any organized mutual assistance, these wealthy and powerful companies sought to (and succeeded in ) maximizing their profits by using the labor of the poor and impotent at almost no cost to the company.One needs to search intensely to finally reveal the true history of our period of industrialization. It is of great credit to the producer's and director's of such films as Matewan that we can see clearly the history and ongoing great struggle between the working class and the wealthy elite to obtain their proper share of profits.This is a film where one enters a theater to be entertained, but leaves having the stirrings of compassion and outrage raised in their hearts.

All of the acting is great, including, in the starring role, Chris Cooper, (the Kansas City native who was the abusive father from American Beauty and who starred in another fantastic Sayles film from 1996, Lonestar), David Strathairn as the good-natured but stern police chief, and, in his only theatrical movie role ever (here at 14 years old), indie-folk legend Will Oldham, of Palace Music and Bonnie Prince Billie fame. He plays a preacher-in-training in the film, and does such a great job that it seems damn unfortunate for all of us that he didn't continue his acting career--though he would go on to make some great music, and continues to currently. It also features James Earl Jones, aka Darth Vader.Anyway, the film is very honest, subtle and exquisite. You don't feel, as you do with many films churned out by Hollywood, that things have been altered and embellished for the sake of making it interesting--it's very natural, and it seems very real. You're confidant that Sayles is giving you the truth here, as best he can, through his visual style, restrained, natural dialogue and engaging historic atmosphere.It's movies like this that renew my faith in period pieces. Important historical films at their best are able to capture a period and bring the audience as close as possible to experiencing the 'feel' of that time--I guess that kinda goes without saying though.

The subject matter cried out 'dull but worthy' and John Sayles is distinctly hit-and-miss when dealing with historical subjects, as the problematic Eight Men Out underlines, but this is quite a superb movie with a scope well beyond its budget. Almost a slow burn western as a miner's strike leads slowly but inevitably to a violent shootout between the railroad detectives and the local lawman and strikers, it's an involving and intelligent piece of work. That's not to say it's without problems it perhaps overstates Kevin Tighe's villainous stupidity (could he really have laughed his way through a sermon without seeing the relevance?), a scene where the white, black and Italian miners set aside their differences through music feels too Hollywood, and Haskell Wexler over diffuses the light a couple of times in that irritating late-70s-early-80s way in his otherwise exemplary cinematography. Sayles briefly offers another one of his stomach-turning cameos as a preacher, but at least he's only in it for a minute or two (unlike his genuinely irritating Ring Lardner impersonation in Eight Men Out) and he's on much more solid grounds with his impressive ensemble cast &#150; a young Chris Cooper on excellent form, Mary McDonnell before she got irritating, James Earl Jones before he stopped acting, David Strathairn, Bob Gunton and Will Oldham among them. You get the sense that Sayles likes his characters and cares for them. It's that which prevents the film from slipping into easy dogma and posturing and which makes it still seem surprising and shocking when the inevitable violence breaks out. And it's that that helps you overlook the flaws and embrace its many strengths.

Miners had to pay for all their own equipment, their housing was owned by the mining company and they also paid for it, workers were also paid in credits which they could only use at the mining company store. Workers who went strike were subsequently evicted from their homes.This movie is great. It's a page from history which should be told much more often. James Earl Jones is terrific as a black miner who is signed up as a scab but he's actually a union sympathizer who encourages the black scabs to strike with the West Virginia workers.Chris Cooper is also great as a union organizer. I think he's a highly underrated actor. He was very good in American Beauty as the hick next door neighbor and he's great in Matewan as well.

I think that was due to his role as the warden in The Shawshank Redemption where he just let it all out.I liked one scene in particular early in the film where the union men on strike try to weed out Cooper by finding out how much he knows about union history.

By making the miners work for the company, live in a company owned home and by not paying those cash, but instead making them buy their goods at the company store on company credit was like slavery. The workers are fed up in the story, and like any battle, there are two sides. One side is pro union, which the mine owners believe these are the Reds or communist, and the other sides of the battle are those that don't want the union; mostly these are the bad guys who own the mines (and most of the town). In today's world, we still see injustice arising like those of early twentieth century America, but in third world countries such as those in Africa.The best part of the film was the ending when the union workers and the mine owners face off in a confrontational shootout in the streets of town. It was beautifully shot with great scenery and suspense. Just at the drop of a hat, the town was forever changed. The sheriff, played by David Straithairn comes off almost cocky in his favor of the townspeople over the arrogance of the mine owner's thugs. It is good to see the law taking the side of the oppressed and not the oppressor.The two thugs sent by the mine owners were very much flat characters, drawn out and overused, even stereotypical at times. Forcing their way into the home of the woman and her son, and displacing the union organizer, they were rude and chauvinist too. Pulling a gun on a boy at the dinner table though, how immature. So I was especially grateful that they were on the losing side, much where John Sayles would like us to see them, which is probably why they were so flat and stereotypical.

They reference memory, the angst of vision, and emptiness of creation. They are ambitious and every bit as lovely as this.Here, I think Sayles decided he would attempt something simple and master it utterly, using `How Green Was My Valley' as a template. As there, so here. The situation is two dimensional with the bad guys and the salt-of-the-earth innocents. The development of the story is entirely linear with various enobling events. As there, so here with the director finding the most artistic Hollywood cinematographer in Wexler (as did John Ford with Arthur Miller). In both cases, the lighting is ethereal, placing these artificially gritty folks in a sort of Disneyland coal town.It is a remarkably simple morality play, but Sayles does indeed envelop it entirely. He has a special skill in visual narrative continuity. The motion of the dialog, the movement of the actors and the movement of the camera eye all continue from one set of scenes to another as visual phrases. I know no one else who does this so well with these three factors.As an aside, the situation of West Virginia is odd. It is the Saudi Arabia of coal, and as with Arabia, West Virginia should have elevated a largely illiterate populace to grand wealth and the foibles that come with it. Instead, essentially the rest of the country has conspired to take for ourselves without giving back, like we grandly subsidize Alaska. Here, Sayles mines this sad history for our comfortable, warm moralizing. Is it much different?Ted's evaluation 3 of 4 -- Worth Watching.

I immediately remembered about John Sayles and his nouvellas of cinema. With Lone Star I bemoaned the lack of a visual imagination, but coming to a Sayles film for a narrative like I did with Matewan, I leave completely satisfied. The man excels in telling us stories with scope and values of importance.What a lovely world he creates here, among the derelict shacks and cabins of the Pennsylvania foothills of Matewan a moral struggle is fought, flawed characters with faces blackened by coaldust fumble with great ideals and big hopes for a better future, and the one thing that stands between them and justice is their own prejudice. I like how the film suggests that for the collective to be reformed the individual must be reformed first, that we need to look inwards first before we make a stand. The stand in the film is heroic but also desperate, a bit of a lawless old West on the way to emancipation. John Sayles is a leftist and this comes across loud and clear in Matewan, but unlike a Godard film like Week End, Sayles doesn't call for blood, he calls for social justice.The narrative here sprawls in and out of log cabins where sullen faces plot strikes and discuss ideals, in and out of makeshift tents and muddy town streets where coalminers live and die and sing, now a fiddle or harmonica is calling out from the dark the sad tune of a life of suffering, and the finale is sealed with a shootout filled with tragedy and hope. Sayles' camera doesn't intrude in any of this, rather it's invited in and hankers down out of way to quietly listen or conspire.Matewan makes a great doublebill with Martin Ritt's The Molly Maguires, another forlorn drama of the oppressed that speaks of moral devastation in the Pennsylvania coal fields, but more, it stands by itself as one of the great American narratives of the 80's.

The townsfolk are more or less in thrall to the Stone Mountain Coal Company. The company pays its workers in company-issued scrip, not cash, which can be redeemed only at company facilities like the store and the workers' housing. The workers themselves, laboring under dismal and dangerous conditions, must pay for everything a la carte, including their work tools.The miners don't care for the arrangement, nor for the scab laborers -- blacks and Italian immigrants -- that the company brings in.Enter the union man Chris Cooper, a Christ-like figure preaching brotherhood and non-violence. He has his hands full getting the townsfolk to work together with the alien black and the Guappos who use corn meal to make something called polenta instead of good old-fashioned corn bread. It gets especially difficult when the Stone Mountain Coal Company hires a couple of mean goons -- Kevin Tighe and Gordon Clappe -- to evict troublesome families from company housing, forcing most of them to live in tents. Sheriff David Strathairn is on the side of the workers and forbids any confrontations in the town.I don't want to get into the plot in too much detail. It's a bit complicated and it leads to a more or less accurately depicted, but nevertheless familiar, shoot out between a dozen or more company thugs and the men and women of the town, with casualties on both sides.It's practically an object lesson in Marxist theory. The people of Appalachia aren't like Southerners. They were yeomen farmers. No big cotton plantations. They didn't object to strong liquor. And when they drink, it's not even bourbon. When the despicable traitor to the cause pours himself a drink, it's a clear liquor. And it's not vodka or gin, it's shine. And the mountain folk weren't wedded to slavery either. That's why we have a West Virginia as well as a Virginia. During the Civil War the governors of one or two Southern states had to send troops into the mountains to quell rebellions against the Confederacy. The hillbillies didn't necessarily want to remain in the Union. They wanted to be left alone.Their allegiance seldom extended beyond the local community or Holler, sometimes not farther than the extended family. As a union organizer, this makes Chris Cooper's job of implementing Marxism that much more difficult. The general idea is to persuade people that their misery isn't their own fault, not due to bad luck or laziness, but to their limited conception of power. Power lies not in loyalty to one's family or small community or ethnic group or race. Marx called that false consciousness. To liberate themselves, exploited laborers must make the transition to class consciousness by realizing that we're all in this together and have to exercise collective power.The movie dramatizes this conflict pretty well. It's a bit slow at the beginning but the tension grows quickly after we get to know the principles and their situations.Haskel Wexler's photography adds to the appeal, and the production design is splendid. Note the widow hanging up her laundry. The wooden clothes pins are old, worn, and dark. And she's hanging up a patchwork quilt, a signature artifact in the Mountain South. Even the dialect is fairly accurate. The narrator uses the regional hit for it -- as in Hit was in 1920 that the massacre happened. You won't hear that extra h in Charleston.The movie uses an assortment of symbols too. In the opening scene, we watch two disgruntled miners tamp a stick of dynamite into the wall of a coal mine and wait at a distance as the fuse burns down. (Get it?) The villagers near the beginning are seen playing a slow, not particularly catchy folk tune on guitar and fiddle. Later, one of the imported black men, James Earl Jones, joins in with a bluesy harmonica. By the end an Italian is playing along with them on a mandolin. (They're all playing the same tune now.) And the approaching train bringing the army of company goons emits great billows of ominous black smoke. (Well, I don't have to draw anybody a picture.) Chris Cooper has a sensitive face and thoughtful demeanor. He's the kind of actor who can -- and has -- gone either way, towards goodness or evil. A marvelous performance from Kevin Tighe as the smiling, confident, slimy villain. The guy has a great big, unashamedly Irish face. He's one of those suave heavies, charming when he's not committing murder. If he were a British heavy he might be James Mason. The poorest -- or let's say least convincing performance -- is from Will Oldham as Danny, the boyish nascent preacher. One winces when listening to him. He doesn't have the accent down, and neither do most of the others. Highland speech is really distinct, still. Bread becomes braid, and a tomato is a mater. James Earl Jones always radiates good will and is both comfortable and comforting. We don't get to see much of the Italians.It's propaganda, of course. Sayles' loyalty is never in question. But it' well-done propaganda and possibly a necessary memento of how bad things can get when Mining Companies are left to their own devices, able to make their own rules about the workers' safety and welfare. Not that the other side is endorsed without reservation. At one point, some miners are saved by the intrusion of a strange group of armed and ragged hunters called Foothill People. They don't hold with cars. They call them machines and curse them. And they say things like, The only law 'round here is the law of nature. I hope the writers didn't intend that as an admirable take on the character of justice.

Matewan quite accurately shows all the different types of characters and groups that played in such conflicts during the late 19th century to early 20th. Such conflicts erupted due to the different (actually, the opposite) interests of the corporate capitalists and the lower classes. While the movie is slightly biased in favor of the mistreated strikers (as is natural), it portrays an accurate picture of the events that occurred in Matewan as well as other mining towns in the early 1900's of West Virginia.

I wasn't around in 1920, but the gritty feel of the times is present, in spades, along with the sheer poverty surrounding the mines. At the same time, we're made to feel the abominable safety conditions prevailing in the black holes. No, this film ain't going to play your local chamber of commerce anytime soon. After all, union organizer Kernehan (Cooper) isn't just an outsider, he's likely also a communist, though the script fudges the issue. The coal company is about to beat back the strikers with Negro and ethnic scabs, until the organizer arrives with a tactical sense of how to foil their plans. So now the company brings in two arrogant thugs to push the miners out of town. And we anticipate a dramatic showdown, but one that's also based on historical fact.I love the way Sayles refuses to prettify the mountain folk. In their plain print dresses and drab denim work clothes, they're the anti-Hollywood. And when chief thug Hickey calls winsome Bridey Mae mountain trash, I wanted to reach through the screen and throttle him. I also love the moment when colored scab Few Clothes (Jones) enters the union meeting wanting to join up. It's an understandably hostile reception, until Kernahan defuses the hostility by telling the men to recognize a worker when they see one. And indeed, the strike won't succeed unless the racial and cultural differences are overcome. I like the way Sayles shows this overcoming in small steps, instead of rubbing our nose in it with a kumbaya moment.It's also apparent that religion plays a big part in how the mountain folk react to organizing efforts. The established preacher's (Sayles) message is to stick with the company and reject union troublemakers. For years, his message has prevailed. However, the kid preacher Danny (Oldham, in a gripping performance) is no longer just an oddity. Now he has seen the struggle, knows the sacrifices, and experienced the brutal company tactics. Thus, his movement toward the union message both helps galvanize the community, as well as reflects their becoming radicalized.I also like the fact that when push comes to shove with the company thugs, the town mayor and sheriff, defend their community. That's based on historical fact, and not what you'd expect when the company, in effect, owns the town (the houses and stores). But the allegiance of the two town officials is ultimately with the people instead of the owners. In fact, it's that growing sense of labor solidarity and community identity that create the force capable of standing up to the combined business interests that extend beyond the little town of Matewan.I guess my only reservation is with the two company thugs. Their arrogance, especially in the revival meeting, is spread on pretty thick. In effect, Sayles has stacked the deck by making them and the side they represent so dislikable. It doesn't reach the level of caricature, but it is manipulation, perhaps in a good cause, but manipulation nevertheless. On the other hand, the mountain folk are fortunately not romanticized or patronized. Instead, they come across as ordinary people finally responding to a bad situation that's only grown worse over time. Then too, Cooper's Kernahan is not romanticized as one might expect if this were a Hollywood treatment. He does intercede at important times, especially with his understanding that violence will only benefit the bosses. And though the unionists win the showdown, unless I missed something, we're not shown that they win the strike as a result.Anyway, in my little book, this is Sayles' biggest triumph. Filming on location was simply indispensable to the movie's gritty period feel. It's hard to believe that one man could be behind such a professional appearing production, especially as someone basically outside the movie-making industry. That, no doubt, accounts for the movie's willingness to take chances. I just wish the movie could be shown in every highschool history class. People need to be reminded why union's came into being, especially with so much anti-worker static being currently spun. Of course, no institution is above criticism, labor unions included. Nonetheless, America's bloody history of winning worker rights needs to be told each generation. Thanks John Sayles for resurrecting this important story.

Artistic works that discuss the clashes between labor and capital during the Gilded and Progressive Eras will undoubtedly include a discussion of radical political beliefs that those with conservative tastes in 2012 may find offensive or un-American. Nevertheless, the clashes between workers and the owners of companies are an important part of American history, certainly as much as the Civil War, World War II, or the tumults of the 1960s, and it is important for writers and filmmakers to mention them now and again. In this sense, a quality movie like Matewan is an exception rather than the rule with regards to period dramas related to important events in American history. The sensitive and poignant way by which John Sayles tells the story of West Virginia coal miners and a labor strike which culminated in bloodshed make the audience engaged in the plot and, by extension, the real life events described in the movie.The film itself is seldom boring, and the protagonist characters (Chris Cooper, Mary McDonnell, and Will Oldham) are sympathetically credibly portrayed. The harsh realities of the West Virigina miners of the 1910s and 1920s is portrayed in such a graphic and grim manner that the audience has an actual stake in their struggle as it portrayed in the film. The antagonist characters--the thugs hired by the Baldwin Felts Detective Agency to put down the strike by any means necessary--are less interestingly portrayed they are evil to the core, with nothing in their portrayal that would make them redeemable or three-dimensional. Some viewers will not like that the antagonists are not treated as realistic persons, but rather as monsters. There are few shades of grey in Sayles' movie the miners are the good guys, and the mine owners and their hired thugs are the bad guys. Notwithstanding the dual morality depicted in the movie, the film is stark in its realism, and there is little to take away from it that will leave the audience with a warm feeling. While Matewan ultimately comes across as a polemic film with an obvious message about the struggles of the working man, it is still a powerful and well-made drama that viewers will find involving. The real Battle of Matewan and the West Virginia Miners' Strike of the early 1920s are obscure events in American history, but are nevertheless important as part of the greater trend of social unrest inherent in America's Industrial Revolution.

His views are not difficult to make out. He retains his sympathy for the ordinary person, his dislike and mistrust of large corporations, his feeling for the labour movement, his support for national struggles against American interests and its agents abroad. These ideas, however, may prove inadequate. - David WalshPoverty is the parent of revolution and crime. - AristotleJohn Sayles has always been one of the least radical of supposedly radical filmmakers. Whilst overtly political artists like Pontecorvo, Gavras, Loach, Godard, Rosselini, Pasolini, Visconti, Romero, Renoir etc etc (many of whom regarded themselves as socialists/communists/Marxists) pushed themselves further with each film - aesthetically and thematically - Sayles has sealed himself into a very simplistic world-view. One that is largely unchanging, and one which he spends his career shoehorning all his characters into.That said, Matewan is one of Sayles' best films precisely because of its simplicity. The film tells the story of an early effort to unionise West Virginian coalfields, and takes place in an isolated town where coal miners are bullied by various mining corporations and their gun-toting thugs. The miners won't stand for this, of course, and led by Joe Kenehan, a communist sympathising pacifist (You work, they don't. That's all you got to know about the enemy!), they form trade unions, a militia and unite against their masters.Matewan works well on at least three levels. On the first, you have a Robert Altman inspired tapestry, Sayles introducing numerous characters and then sketching their criss-crossing relationships. Sayles often does this, of course, but unlike Altman's best films, Salyes' characters are largely walking mouthpieces, caricatures out of the World Socialist Textbook. And so you have the black proletariat leader and the white proletariat leader, both of whom learn that race is less a divider than class. Then you have the cruel corporate owners, the evil gun-hands, the preacher boy who oscillates between violent and non-violent resistance, the sheriff sympathetic to the striking miners, the communist agitator who teaches these American fools to stand up to their whip-masters, and the various civilians, wives and mothers caught in the middle.On the second level, you have an interesting sub-theme involving the way in which the secular world of organised labour intersects with religion and the church. The meeting point between each branch is our narrator, a young boy called Danny Radnor, who works as a miner and fully supports the strike and the Union, but also promotes his evangelical faith by becoming a preacher. What the film argues, though, is that socialism is, and should be, a departure from the teachings of 19th century Christianity. Labor unions, though resemblant of the church in some ways, are secular, worldly, modernist, non-conformist, and distinctly non-religious in their very existence, whilst the church (whose codes are mirrored to that of the coal company) promotes conformity, traditionalism, and subservience. This is all unsurprising; the Church has always been reactionary, sided against the working class, and supported fascism, dictators, monarchs and the ruling class over any even vaguely egalitarian movement. The Church, in a sense, has thus always been anti-Christ.What the film then does is ask whether the non-violence of the church and the turn the other cheek methodology of Kenehan, an atheist and communist agitator, both of whom refuse to be goaded into violence, can have any effect. The film provides no answers, both pacifism and violent recourse seen to be unsatisfactory, both with equally severe repercussions.On the third level, Matewan functions well as a Western. And so Sayles offers an assortment of gunfights, show-downs, tense stand offs and uneasy eyeballing, all of which help make Matewan the most tense and exciting film in Sayles' filmography. As the Western genre generally relies upon one-dimensional villains and clearcut conflicts, Sayles' stereotypes also feel at home. And while most of Sayles' films offer a kind of false, superficial scope, Matewan is somewhat mythic, with an almost parable-like quality. Matewan's cast is mostly excellent, particularly Sayles regulars Chris Cooper (a quiet commie), David Strathairm (an endearing sheriff), Kevin Tighe (a scenery chewing villain), Mary McDonnell (brilliant in her quieter moments) and some cool hillbilly mountain men (sadly appearing in only one scene). In terms of flaws, Matewan's first act is badly paced, some of its dialogue is far too obvious, as a critique of capitalism it's now lightweight, and Sayles never fully investigates the mechanics of the coal corporations, who heavily dominated the official culture and politics of the region. Today, global capitalism has all but killed unions. The development of a global job market, the appearance of billion of new workers and the readiness of millions more to work at any cost has robbed unions of their once-powerful position. And as the unions created the middle class, with them gone, the middle class begins to fade too. The response of artists like Sayles to such pressures has always been to nostalgically pine for a vague form of 20th century socialism, a stance which isn't necessarily wrong, but is nevertheless now too simplistic a post-capitalist alternative. Humans, and artists, need to think harder, envision deeper and plan more rigorously. Commies with six-shooters and 20th century slogans aren't going to emancipate a self-regulated, self-policed global workforce in possession of HD TVs and zillion dollar military hardware. Not a chance in hell.8/10 &#x96; For a more substantial take on this material, seek Pontecorvo, Loach, early Pasolini and Martin Ritt's The Molly Maguires, which tells virtually the same story.

The sole problem is that there is so much information to convey in a short period of time, there had to be some glossing over of the events that transpired.Being a big issue for the region at the time, the movie captured the feel of the plight of the area so well. If you are looking for more information and in greater depth than the 127 minutes of the film allows, try and find the book Night Comes to the Cumberlands by Harry M Caudhill which deals with the plight of the miners.Having the miners paid by company scrip and the shops (owned by the companies) taking scrip for their goods only was such a cunning move.

"},{"Title":"unfocused history lesson","Date":"5 December 2010","Score":"","Genre":"Drama, History","Review":" Writer director John Sayles turns the pages of history back to West Virginia circa 1920, where overworked and underpaid employees of the Stone Mountain Coal Company attempt to unionize the mines, touching off a violent confrontation with company strikebreakers. The background is perfect for what should have been a tidy little historical drama, but Sayles opts for the romantic approach, with lots of photogenic poverty and soft-focus solidarity. His intentions are honorable, but the film is far too superficial to function as anything more than propaganda the miners all wear halos, the company gunmen all have forked tails, and the final showdown comes after one too many subplot and campfire sermon. Capable performances and scenic photography aren't enough to compensate for an overplotted, overwritten script, which too often sounds like a grade school primer on early labor organization. The facts demand more than the two-dimensional treatment given here. "},{"Title":"A labor conflict in the Wild West","Date":"13 October 2010","Score":"","Genre":"Drama, History","Review":" Being a European I had some difficulty in understanding the occurrences in this film. It tells the true story of the labor conflict of coal miners in Virginia around 1920. They are dissatisfied with the working conditions and go on strike. The company uses the truck-system, and the workers live in company houses. So the company takes with the other hand, what the one has paid out in wages. Right at the start we see the strikers in action while stopping a train and trying to thrash a group of so-called scabs (who apparently were unaware of the prevailing conflict). In addition the strikers employ anarchist methods to intimidate the employer, like sabotage with dynamite sticks. It is not surprising, that the employer has placed a machine gun at the premises. On the other hand the employer himself uses similar methods, and has hired a private security firm in order to intimidate the people. He tries to bribe the mayor and the sheriff. Yes, they still have a real sheriff over there, complete with a badge and belt and pistols on both sides, like an ancient Sam McCloud! Fortunately for the miners, this local establishment remains on their side. When the bandits of the security firm try to evict several families from their company homes, the sheriff maintains that this action is illegal and puts an end to it. However, we as the audience lack the information needed to judge which of the quarreling parties has the supreme law on its side. Luckily we still have the union of miners, and they send an organizer Joe Kenehan into the area. This man is as best as you can get them. He has a social hearth and strongly opposes violence, firstly because it is against his principles, and secondly because the workers will eventually lose an armed battle. The union brings some material support to the strikers, like camping tents, which transform the area into a kind of refugee camp. During the night the company bandits have a raid and fire at random. The climax is reached when two young men try to steal coal, and one of them gets his throat cut by the security bandits. The miners revolt, and a gun battle ensues in which the mining company is temporarily defeated. However, both sides suffer severe losses, among which is the fatally wounded unarmed organizer. The film suggests, that this was the start of a long range of armed collisions between employers and workers. In Europe we have never seen similar scenes, and in my eyes the film looks more like a western than like a film about unionism. Perhaps it has some similarities with the French film Germinal, which however narrates a story about a labor conflict around 1870 - so half a century before! And even in that tragic event the national guard was immediately present as the legitimate defender of the law. I guess the differences reflect the weak position of the authorities in the American Federation. There was hardly any authority or legitimate law in the newly conquered land, and the people had to take matters into their own hands. Of course the most powerful party will always win, but in American states like Virginia there was no strong local or regional authority, that could play the role of mediator in order to mitigate excesses. The narrative suggests that the film director Sayles sympathizes with the miners, but essentially the whole mess turns out to be a display of stupidity. But perhaps this is European prejudice. Apart from this drawback, the acting is convincing, the dialogs are realistic, and the film shots aptly convey the local conditions.

This movie takes place at a time and place in our history when men literally spilled their blood and lost their lives to fight for the right to unionize, especially in the coal mining industry, where miners were often paid in company script instead of money which could only be used to purchase overpriced goods in company owned stores and the company held the title on their rented homes, so they could evict any troublemaker at any time for any reason. This movie shows what happens when men decide not to accept their fate anymore, and the extent the companies would go to keep the men working as little better than indentured servants, including murder. A sad, brutal period in our history, magnificently acted and beautifully filmed. A little known, but must-see film.

Despite this technical inaccuracy it is still an excellent film, well acted and written, and worth the viewers' time.I realize that at the time the movie was made the active rail lines in West Virginia were welded and not jointed, so perhaps to keep the overall location accurate,( Matewan is in Kentucky, right across the ridge from West Virginia), they had to use jointed rail.The engine in the movie was a more modern steam engine but very few working engines exist from the 1920's. And yes, I am a trainspotter.

Despite some fine acting and good scenes here and there, I was disappointed in how sluggish the whole film was.The blame for this must rest squarely on the shoulders of director/writer John Sayles, who has trouble setting a good pace and finding a dramatic center for the film. At first it looks like Chris Cooper's union organizer character will have that role, but the film loses interest in him midway, spreading it's concentration willy-nilly among a variety of people. Some of the characters - chiefly the local sheriff Sid Hatfield - never get sufficient screen time to give their characters the dramatic weight they're supposed to have.  It also doesn't help that the wonderful David Strathairn - who plays Hatfield - is forced to wear this hat that makes him look goofy, rather like a comic Walter Brennan character from a John Ford Western.There are fine individual performances Strathairn, Cooper, James Earl Jones, Mary McDonnell, Will Oldham, and others.  But Sayles just doesn't give the drama much momentum; the movie just moves along slowly from scene to scene.It's amazing that Sayles went on to write and direct the excellent Eight Men Out just the next year.  All the problems on display here are barely evident with that film.
