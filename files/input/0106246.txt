The plane really was chartered by a bunch of ruggedly handsome young men -- what else do you expect from a rugby team? And yes, the search was dramatic (the moment when Roberta Cannessa's father learned that his son is alive is one of those stranger-than-fiction moments), but it was enough of a task to compress the survivors' story into a feature film. The search would have comprised another film entirely on its own.How do you compress nearly three months of terror and tedium into less than two hours while still holding the attention of the audience? It's a daunting task, and Alive manages quite nicely. With technical consulting provided by crash survivor Nando Parrado, Alive captures the look and mood of the crash site, and sketches in the relationships among the passengers of the ill-fated flight.It leaves many strange questions hanging (Where, in this plane full of mostly unmarried adults, does Nando come up with two tiny red sneakers?) and those questions are best answered by reading the book. And watch Alive again. Things become clearer with multiple viewings.

I thought it was well shot, well acted and the fact that the real survivors were on hand as technical advisors showed me that the film was as accurate as it could be. One of the frustrations Ive come across in discussing this film is when you mention it to someone, and their immediate response is isn't that the movie where they all eat each other?...obviously, these people latched on to one small part of the story, and feel it is the basis for the entire movie. I found Alive to be more of an uplifting story. Sure, there's cannibalism involved, but in the 2 hours the film takes, cannibalism is focused on for approximately 10-15 minutes. I, instead, found myself moved by the determination of these young boys to survive. The plane crash, the avalanche, starvation, illness...all insurmountable odds stacking themselves against them, and they STILL found the strength to preserve their own lives. Alive as a movie about cannibalism? No. It is an example of the human spirit, and (I use the term again) an uplifting film with many touching moments. In closing, I borrow a line from the film...If I die, you can eat me. -) "},{"Title":"Gut-Wrenching Story Of Surviving The Impossible","Date":"31 July 2003","Score":"61 out of 69 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Adventure, Biography, Drama","Review":"  I can remember reading the book on which this story was based many years ago when I was in High School and being engrossed by the story. The movie version is no less engrossing, the entire story being made absolutely gut-wrenching by the fact that it's true. A South American rugby team is stranded in the remote heights of the Andes after a plane crash and has to find a way to survive the freezing temperatures, their injuries and a variety of other challenges (not the least of which is a lack of food.) The acting in it is good, but the situation itself becomes the focus rather than the actors, and so I can't really say that anyone in particular stood out to me, but that doesn't come across as a weakness here. After all, the story of survival was a story of teamwork; a star to the movie would have detracted from that.This is literally gut-wrenching stuff, and I'm surprised it doesn't have a higher rating. It is not an easy movie to watch at times. The injuries are graphically portrayed, the suffering of the injured very realistic and the ultimate solution to the food problem will upset some people (but, in spite of what I've heard some say about this movie, it isn't the focus of the story. It's just an example of what had to be done to survive in an impossible situation.)

If you didn't know better, you would say it was all made up by some scenarist with too much of inspiration, looking for a spectacular and sometimes shocking script. But unfortunately enough it all really happened, which makes the movie interesting to watch.For those who don't know the story yet, it is based on what happened to the Uruguayan rugby team during and after their plane crash in the middle of the Andes mountains in 1972. Some of them survive the initial crash, some wounded, others only with some minor scratches. They pray that they will soon be found, but no search team is coming to rescue them. At first they keep themselves alive by eating what they find in the luggage of the passengers, but soon that food is also gone. If they don't eat, they will all die. And they need to gain strength, because they need to try to get help themselves. There is only one horrible solution they will have to eat the dead people...Despite the fact that this may sound horrible to many, I must say that it isn't as bad as you may think. Of course you'll see them cut a piece out of the bodies and eat it, but it is done in a watchable way. I'm sure that only the very faint of heart will not be able to watch it. It's a part of the story, but it is never shown in a too spectacular or sensational way.All in all this is a very interesting movie. I asked myself several times 'What would you do if you were in that situation? Would you eat it or not?' I'm not sure, but I guess I would, but that's not why I tell you this. Just the fact that I was able to think about it in this way shows that it wasn't too bloody or with too much gore (I really don't like that). That's why I reward this movie with a 7.5/10.

The reality i felt when watching this movie was how easily we take for granted things like food to eat, clean clothes to wear, and warmth that comes from blankets and heaters. By the middle of the movie (when watching it last night after nearly 10 years) i was aghast at the sheer strength of some of all of the people that survived the initial crash of the actual plane. And when the deciding moment arrives where they must choose whether they are willing to eat human flesh to survive and find a way beyond the Andes, I found i asked myself 'what would you do?'. The answer is, i don't know. i truly don't. This movie makes you realise how precious life is, and how we should never take anything for granted. How we should be thankful of all that we have, and yet how easy it is to lose all that just by a bad twist of fate. Call this movie what you will, I think it's a must-see for everyone because it really happened. There are lessons to be learned, morals to be recognised, and questions to be asked and somehow solved. Each person/character you will encounter in this movie is unique which makes it all the more worthwhile to watch. Because you find yourself sympathetic with the viewpoints of all the men and women in the movie yet at the same time questioning what decision you would make if you were in their place. Maybe we never will know or understand what they went through. But by watching this movie and reading the book, it will help us become wiser people and possibly open our minds to the endless enigma that is life, God, and the vastness and emptiness of the world that lies not so beyond our reach.

It is based on a true event in 1972 and on the narrative book by Piers Paul Read.  It's about a Uraguayan college rugby team whose chartered airplane crashed deep in the icy Andes Mountains while on its way to a game in Santiago, Chile.  Reeling with disbelief and shock and bleeding from dozens of wounds,  the passengers who lived through the crash are faced with the brutal elements,  starvation and the horror that they may never be found alive.  The cast is terrific  Ethan Hawke as Nando,  the levelheaded,  determined leader;  Vincent Spano as desperate Antonio,  whose optimism slowly crumbles under the weight of hopelessness; Josh Hamilton as medical student Roberto,  who tirelessly treats gangrenous wounds knowing his ministrations are useless;  and especially Bruce Ramsay as Carlitos,  whose unwavering faith in God and his sense of dark humor (If you eat me,  will you promise to clean your plates?) acts as the glue that holds this wet,  shivering clump of survivors together.  You indeed can feel the cold and the misery as you watch these poor people wade through waist deep snow,  endure a nightmarish avalanche,  spend days at a time soaked to their skins in minus forty degree winds,  and face the ultimate decision that will make or break them physically,  emotionally and spiritually whether or not they can bring themselves to eat the bodies of friends and relatives who did not survive the crash.  Everything in this movie,  from James Newton Howard's touching music score to the unbeatable cinematography showing the majesty and severity of the Andes, is beautiful and flawless. This movie is one I'd recommend to anyone who wants an exciting, touching, unforgettable movie to chew on for years to come.

Although critics and viewers(why then did you waste your money?)  nitpick the dialogue, it ran smoothly in the compressed time given. Exactly how would you pass the time in conversation if you survived the plane crash, freezing temperatures, hunger and watching other people die in front you for 72 days? I don't think the dialogue was that bad, considering the time slot and trying to keep the story interesting for its two hours. When I first saw it, I was shocked by the plane crash sequence. I first thought it was all about cannibalism-like the Donner party- but it wasn't. It was more about keeping hope alive and working together even when despair and dying seems easier to give in to. What the rugby teammates did under the circumstances was incredible until they made the solution to hike out and get help. I haven't read the book its based on, yet I read a little about the actual people who went through the ordeal. There are similarities and contrasts with the real-life story and the movie.

One day I decided to read the book and short after that this movie was released. I couldn't wait to see it, and when I did I was a little disappointed (as you always are when you've already read the book). If you really want to know everything about the accident, read the book.Some thoughts and facts- The movie is faithfull to the book (of course, the book has much more information).- The survivors had plenty of offers for a book deal, and they took the one that gave them almost not money at all because they didn't want their tragedy to become a shocking Stephen King-like novel with gore, etc. The book documents facts, it has no tear-dropping dialogue or 20/20-like lines.Some points about other comments and critics- Yes, they were nice boys. They were the rugby team of the Old Christians School (I'm not translating the name of the school, that's the actual one), an English catholic school for boys only (at that time at least), private and expensive, where only high-class boys attended.-Also to the previous point Maybe none of the survivors looks exactly like Ethan Hawke, but, YES... some of them WERE blonde with blue eyes. Most people, especially in the US and Europe, tend to think that in Uruguay (a country with a weird name, i give you that)we all look like native-americans. PLAIN WRONG. Almost all of us are European-americans... the 95% of the population is white and the rest is black or else. As a matter of fact, this is the ONLY American (i mean, North, Central and Southamerica) country that has no native-american population at all. This territory had a very small population when it was conquered by Spain, and they were later killed by our government about 150 years ago (we are not proud of that, but that's the awful truth).- Yes, it was a charter flight, not an airline flight, in an Air Force rented plane to carry the players and some relatives and acquaintances to Chile. (Remember this was people with money and good social positions, therefore connections... and this is a small country).- Yes, the avalanche DID take place.- Yes, the Andes are nice (I myself flew over them twice, breathtaking sights, TRULY beautiful), but this movie was shot in the Canadian Rockies (hehe )Bottom line you can't compress 72 days into two hours and give each one of the people involved enough screen time to understand the part they played in that complex society they constructed in order to survive. Some of the most interesting characters are barely mentioned in the movie. If you are really interested in knowing what happened in that ordeal, again, READ THE BOOK.

It is a superlative sequence that skilfully encapsulates the helplessness and horror of those trapped in such a situation.After such an explosive start the movie quickly settles down to depict the struggles of the survivors of the crash to survive the bleak and freezing conditions.   The first night is a sub-zero nightmare, filled with the groans and cries of the fatally injured as they gradually die.   Ominously, perhaps, the bodies of the dead are not buried beneath the snow, but laid on top of it.That the writer chooses not to focus entirely on the cannibalism in which the handful of survivors partake strengthens the film, and prevents it from becoming a sensationalist gore-fest.   Instead, their decision to eat the dead is just one aspect of a multi-faceted tale of the will to survive against seemingly impossible odds.One problem I had with this movie is that the makers fail to cast actors who look dissimilar enough for the viewer to be able to differentiate one from another.   At times it is difficult to follow the narrative thread because of this, making it hard to be sure what is going on, and what frictions exist within the gradually dwindling group.   The impact on the group of the deaths of individuals as the film progresses is also weakened because the viewer is left unsure of who has actually died.   While the movie does occasionally focus on the psychological effects their dilemma imposes on individuals and the group as a whole, it does so only fitfully, as if the task is too daunting.The movie is very gripping, however, and never drags throughout its 2 hour-plus running time, and the makers can, perhaps, be forgiven for an ending that seems just a little too sentimental.

I would argue it is coherent because of the coherence of the society from which the survivors sprang most of them had gone to the same school, all of them had grown up in the same small country and, perhaps most importantly, all of them were Roman Catholics.

And oh yes, they will be made-for-TV - the kiss of death for any movie project as far as I'm concerned. This was the kind of prejudice that almost made me avoid watching this movie when my Better Half threw in the DVD. So it says something when I found my attention diverted to this harrowing and beautifully shot drama based on a horrifying true story.In 1972, a plane carrying a Uruguayan rugby team was crossing the Andes when their plane crashed in bad weather in the mountains. A number were killed and the survivors quickly began to realise that the unforgiving weather, lack of supplies and a called-off rescue mission would mean certain death. But some weren't ready to give up without a fight, meaning that they would have to overcome impossible odds just to survive. Faced into an unimaginable situation, what lengths would they go to in order not just to survive but to escape the icy grip of the Andes? Looking and feeling the business, Alive is a genuine triumph of film-making. Filmed high up in the mountains with little else to see besides snow and rocks, it forces home the hopelessness of the unfortunate souls trapped up there. Featuring a largely unknown cast, the horror of their predicament is all the more real. Ironically, the person who dispels the illusion that this is drama and not documentary is the biggest star on screen - Ethan Hawke, though his performance is as faultless as the rest. So with a truly inspiring story of how difficult the human spirit is to defeat, an jaw-dropping vision of brutal isolation and hardship and a cast who give it their everything, why doesn't Alive score higher than it does? The simple reason is that despite the story and everything going for it, Alive is the sort of film that you can only watch once. It reminded me of The Shawshank Redemption, another great film with a rousing finale and a touching tale of spirit but a film that I have little or no resolve to watch again. Watch them once, certainly, but after the magic has gone, what's left? The other thing that works against this film is it's sheer unrelenting sense of disaster. At times, you can't help but feel that it is just too much, even for a film like this. It's just one thing after another but of course, it did happen exactly as you see - the survivors who worked as technical advisers made sure of that. In short, this film is a stunning testament to those who survived the most traumatic of experiences and a solemn memorial to those who lost their lives.

Ethan Hawke and in fact all the cast are fantastic and resemble the actual survivors which made the movie all the more realistic.

As you might expect, this is a film about survival. But it's just as much a film about a faith in God and how much that faith can be tested and still survive. Thankfully, we're not treated to much gore, considering the subject matter, and much of the suffering is left to the imagination (though still painful to watch). Also interesting is the change of leadership among the survivors and how the leaders are able to rise to the changing challenges (which don't let up just because the food is gone!). Photography, editing, and music (Howard's score is grand in the traditional studio sense and this helps humanize the drama) are all excellent. One quibble, the opening shots of the plane look rather fake, especially considering this was ILM, but the crash itself is awesome.

This film is not that amazing film. It does alright, its good but could have been told in a different, and in my opinion, a much better way.The acting was a balance, it was good at times but terrible at other points, lines were delivered rather unenthusiastically or annoyingly overly dramatic by many, but there is also some good acting thrown in, most notably from Ethan Hawke who luckily becomes stronger and more involved as the film proceeds.The way in which the cannibalism issue was handled was impressive, and I would suspect was also realistic. The first time is obviously the worst, morals are questioned as the team make what is a very, very difficult choice to make that was conveyed extremely well in this film. But after the first time it becomes much easier and even casual to some characters which I would believe to be true.My problem with this film was it's tone. The story is about a group of friends and relatives whose plane crashes, killing some while the extreme weather conditions of the Andes slowly kills the others, and how the survivors had to resort to eating their loved ones to stay alive. This is a very dark, disturbing and traumatic true event and I was hoping would spawn a similarly gritty drama that I feel would have more accurately reflected the experience of the rugby team. I found this film to contain a large amount of 90's cheese and to find Disney in the credits probably explains that. The tone and story didn't go together at all, the cheesy film of a nightmarish event is the on screen equivalent of mixing oil with water in my opinion.Overall Alive is an alright film, it tells the story quite well it just has the wrong tone and feel for the most part. I would be very interested to see this film remade, as it is a tremendous event and I believe given a much darker tone, could give life to the film that I believe this true story deserves.

I had heard a lot about this film, mostly about some of the more grisly details, but I was surprised to find how emotional and thrilling it was to watch nonetheless. The plot concerns a Uruguayan plane flying over the Andes. The passengers are rugby players in their early 20s and their coaches on their way to Chile. Suddenly, the plane crashes. The pilots are dead, the radio is useless, the supplies are scarce and it is very very cold. The survivors must find a way to survive against all odds, hoping that someone will find them in this frozen wasteland.If you've heard of this film, it's probably because of the cannibalism involved so I'm going to address that part first. Your instinct is probably to think that either the survivor situation turned into a Lord of the Flies type of thing where people started going crazy and eating each other, or that this is going to be something that borders on a horror film, with people's intestines being strung up over a fire like sausages. That isn't the case.Let me break down the scenario for you The plane has crashed and there is very little food. People are eating a square of chocolate and a thimble of wine daily to make supplies last. Our heroes are scrambling to keep warm. People are dying from their injuries or from disease. Morale is way down and hope seems completely lost. Eventually, someone comes up with the idea of eating the bodies of those who have died. There's a big theme of religion in this film so some argue that once the soul leaves the body, there's nothing left but meat. Others argue (pretty sensibly) that it's an offense to the human body to even think of this. After some thought being put into it, some begin to relate the idea of giving up your flesh to save your friends as something akin to Jesus Christ telling his apostles that the bread they are eating at the last supper is his flesh, given up to save humanity. It's the most shocking part of the story, but it's not just a gimmick, it's a testament to the human will to survive.There's a lot more to this film than just the cannibalism, it really is a story about a group of being that refuse to give up hope. These are not soldiers on a mission that went wrong, or wildlife trackers used to doing whatever it takes to get back home, they're ordinary people. Surviving is about more than just finding food and shelter, it's about getting organized, keeping busy, finding ways to cope with the stress they're under. I liked seeing characters that were just as smart as me. Between the group of people there, you have some ingenious and creative minds that simply refuse to give up. Just on the level of ingenuity you have to applaud these people because you know a lot of people would have just given up.What's so exciting about the film is that these feel like real people. Usually in bad survival movies you always have one random lunatic thrown in the mix. A guy that wants to seize all the power for himself, that will go on a rampage and kill people he feels are slowing down the group or goes all rapist on the one female character because so many screenwriters feel the need to have a villain in the film. It isn't the case here. The enemy is despair and the mountain. The heroes are the survivors. It's a test of endurance, a battle of wits and a tremendous underdog story. The film juggles a lot of characters but you do feel like you get to know the key ones and you get a feel for the group as well. As the number of survivors dwindles I did get emotional about it. I sort of knew where the movie was going, but that didn't make it any less powerful to me.Initially I didn't have any problems with the film at all, but in retrospect I do have to surrender to the fact that despite the film being consistently exciting and kind of awe-inspiring. Alive doesn't really capture the full effect of the story. One might argue that it would be impossible to transfer the gravity of such an event into a 2-hour film, but if there's a flaw, that's it. Because these are actors that the director chose not to starve and because you can't really convey the utter despair you would feel after weeks of being stuck in the wreckage of a plane, surrounded by dead bodies it does feel like there is something missing. That said, it's as good as it's going to get The performances are solid, the special effects are terrific, there's real gravity in the situations. I found it to be thrilling, moving and fascinating to watch. The premise of Alive sounds ghoulish, but this is not a gimmicky exploitation movie, it's a stirring adventure and a drama whose story will stick with you.

Watching those around you die to avalanche, the loss of the human spirit, health deterioration, gangrene, and hunger, trying to maintain your resolve and hold onto faith, and eventually summoning the guts to brave the great white unknown of the mountains and snowy terrain in the hopes of finding rescue, all could make or break the best of us. Alive made some notoriety in its cannibal scenes where those still alive needed to eat from those that died during the crash (and afterward), but to simply identify that to the film alone doesn't do it justice. This film pulls no punches in showing that surviving isn't easy, and the arduous journey to a rescue comes with great sacrifice, a strong will to live, and making difficult decisions that few would ever wish to be burdened with. The desperate times call for desperate measures phrase certainly applies to the harrowing travail that all the survivors are up against. Ethan Hawke, Vincent Spano, and Josh Hamilton lead a strong cast of relative unknowns who all lend gravitas to their roles as struggling members of the rugby team praying to God at night and holding on to what little hope still exists after 60 + days out in the cold, enduring a blizzard, no food besides the dead they have to feed from, and dwindling morale (not to mention, the cold's physical effects on their bodies). Hawke's young man stepping up as a leader when few still have the ability to do so is a great part for him considering his age at the time (really consider what kind of career this man has had; he is a fine actor with a nice resume under his belt), while Hamilton's unsure but vocal character see-sawing about leaving to find that green valley of Chili somewhere over the mountains is another solid character within the film. What I think this film does well is establishing strong characterizations, allowing us to get to know these innocent people fated within an unfortunate situation, who had plans for the future, enduring and often losing to the tragic nature of the unavoidable harshness of inclement weather and freezing environment that befalls them. A riveting, frighteningly realistic and quite incredible true story that is at times really hard to watch and all the while always gripping.

This film may have some issues (mainly involving editing and a little script issue), but there is no denying the personal affection we feel for the characters as they struggle to survive. For a 1993 film, this film has some good special effects as the plane crash was very convincing.Frank Marshall's film is about the fore-mentioned crash in the Andes and it talks about how these men survived in the harsh winter environment with nothing but chocolate and wine. Later on, the film goes on to mention the last resort effort in cannibalism to stay alive, which is really hard to watch even though this is what saved their lives.For a film that doesn't have a big-name cast, the acting was really good and they all added depth to their characters. The only familiar names are Ethan Hawke and Vincent Spano. I really valued Hawke's character, Nando because of his bravery as he went out to find civilization.Overall, Alive is a movie that does the unthinkable and effectively tells an unfilmable event into a harrowing, emotional story. This film has one of the best endings you'll ever see in film, and it will be difficult to hold back the tears while Aaron Neville's Ave Maria, is performing. This film has great characterization and it's as if we went through the terrible ordeal with them. I rate this film 9/10.

This was truly 50 days of hell for all involved, living with dead bodies of former friends, eating them, etc. The Hollywood version is far graphic enough. I could barely watch it as it was, as much for, if not more for, the reality and pain behind such events. I could easily see this as a great vehicle for someone like Hitchcock, who liked to play survivor egos against each other for great drama, ala Liveboat. This director kept it more peaceful and amicable, though I can imagine there was far worse infighting during the actual event. Keep in mind these are not special forces landing on the Andes, but relatively pampered rich kids playing for a rugby team. All the more amazing they were able to survive this.

Alive belongs to the last category.The movie became famous for its cannibalism scenes. Being a shock theme that is usually only portrayed on extreme horror movies or fiction settings (the cannibal being always an alien/werewolf/zombie), it is shown on this movie under a very different light. Some people get uneasy and appalled by the scenes, but they are not appellative and not even a central part of the plot at all. Somber as they are, they push the movie into a more serious territory than the average survival stories around there where positive attitude, faith and altruism, alone, are enough to save your life. In this light, to not ignore the most gruesome aspects of what really happened on the accident is a big plus to Alive.Other positive aspect of this movie is how the social roles among the survivals keep changing progressively in very interesting ways. Immediately after the crash some leaders emerge, keeping control of the imminent dangers and preparing the rest of survivors, and the audience, for what seems to be a quick rendezvous in the snow while some helicopter will come to rescue them. However, as they realize no one is coming for them, the whole social order dismantles, new connections and new power struggles emerge.Those power struggles, however, are portrayed in a very ingenious way. The whole situation is uncommon it is not about limited food rations only, it is not the 10 people on-board and shrinking but 6 people lifeboat only scenario. Emotional breakdowns pose a threat to everyone, and as the movie progress towards its final third, you can see how the prolonged stay in the mountain has changed some characters, not as a matter of redemption or enlightenment usual in such movies (e.g., the drunk father and the careless mother who'd die to save a daughter), but as a result of the completely different life assumptions you have in a mountain, during the winter, after an air crash. Finally, the plot nails it right in not dedicating too much time to the rescue and aftermath. There are no accounts of countless changed lives and how everybody became better people. This might well disappoint those who cannot cope with the realities of the accident. I have watched the movie three times with different crowds of friends and acquaintances, and I remember to have heard some of them complaining that nothing happened in more than 2 hours but the accident and the cannibalism, because they missed the whole picture (pun intended) of the movie.

Some bearded castaways hacking away at corpses with axes and rip saws.But, no. It's actually quite a bit better than that. The airplane crash is fairly well handled by means of special effects and director Frank Marshall's talent. It's pretty horrifying, in fact, almost as good as the disintegration of the Fed Ex airplane in Castaway. About half the passengers die and roughly half survive, mostly members of the world-famous Uruguayan rugby team. They have virtually nothing in the way of food or supplies, and they are in the oxygen-thin air of the crest of the Andes, with nothing in sight but snowy mountain tops from one horizon to the other. The rescue effort was abandoned and yet they managed to survive for more than two months on melted snow and the flesh of their dead comrades.The locations (in British Columbia) are stunning. The snow glistens in the sunlight and you can almost feel your respiratory system shrivel in the icy air.It's hard, though, to tell some of the survivors apart although their names are used repeatedly, as if the writer, John Patrick Shanley, had foreseen the problem. I even lost track of Illeana Douglas, which is difficult. And towards the end, as often as not, the men have slight beards instead of unkempt House of David ornaments on their chins.The dialog, too, is functional but sounds as if it were a translation of the original Spanish or Guarani or whatever it was. It sounds stilted. Hernandez, you must not give up hope. That sort of thing.I was gratified that they didn't dwell on the tabloid aspects of cannibalism. Not that it's very alien in cultures. It is, after all, symbolically represented in many Christian ceremonies -- the body and blood, etc. And it made sense in the circumstances. A 50 kilogram man will yield about 30 kilograms of edible muscle mass if skillfully butchered, and that comes out to about 4000 grams of protein, assuming 90% digestibility, and disregarding inner organs. If they hadn't done it, they most likely would all have died. I'd have had a little trouble with it though.What's missing is the kind of dramatic interplay that one finds in a castaway movie like the original Flight of the Phoenix, the craft involved in illustrating dynamics internal to the group. It's a shame that so many of the survivors look and act alike, because none of them gives an outstanding performance.Worth catching, though.

But what this is lacking from this film is a feeling that these people were pushed to the very limit of human endurance. What we do see on screen for pretty much the entire time is a group of handsome young men, who never lose weight, never seem colder than someone waiting for a bus in winter, never state that they're hungry much, teeth never chatter, do not get frost bite (which must have been rife). Even the two severely injured lads at the back of the plane on stretchers are alert and seemingly healthy for most of the film when they must have been in agony. Also, why do we not see how they reached civilization? Where is the man on horseback that they made contact with? Surely that is one of the most important points of the tale?!! But on the plus side I thought the acting was good, the bits of humour were quite well done, direction and cinematography were some of the best I've ever seen and the special effects were amazing, worthy of an Oscar nomination.

It was absolutely right.One of the must brutal and gut-wrenching drama documentaries I have seen, ALIVE delivers on most points. If the boys have told the truth about their deal with the Andes, this film is about 95% consistent with what actually occurred for real (just a couple of petty details dramatized; I have read the book as well).However, the acting is a bit weak. This story seriously deserved better. Ethan Hawke, who plays the important figure Parrado, does a good job, as well as Josh Hamilton (Canessa), but those two are exceptions. I'd actually go as far as saying that in some scenes, the dead people are the best actors. Also, the narrator who opens up the film does not fit in, feels emotionless and not at all believable.But all in all, it's a story worth to catch up on, fairly well told in its film format. Beautiful scenery, unbelievable courage, poetic, absolutely excellent soundtrack by James N. Howard. Simply put, see it. You might become very tempted to read the book afterwards.

Twenty-one died, either instantly in the crash or from injuries they suffered from it.  Eight more died when what remained of the fuselage was almost buried by an avalanche.  Sixteen of them survived when two of their own breached the Andes and found help.  The ordeal came to an end on December 22, 1972, after seventy days of despair and tragedy.  But part of the survivors' ability to stay alive lay in coming to a harsh realization to eat the bodies of those who had died.ALIVE, directed by former Spielberg assistant Frank Marshall and scripted by John Patrick Shanley (MOONSTRUCK) from Piers Paul Read's great 1974 book about the ordeal, focuses on each and every aspect of this story--the pain, despair, hope, fear, and the bravery, etc.  It also tackles the cannibalistic angle as well, something it could not avoid if it wanted to tell it all.  But unlike the gory 1976 Mexican exploitation flick SURVIVE!, which was based on a totally different account, ALIVE does not dwell on the extraneously gruesome details.  The mostly-young cast gives efficient performances, and the on-location photography (done mostly in the mountains of southwestern Canada) accurately replicates the snowbound Andes.For people who like such true-story movies such as IN COLD BLOOD and ALL THE PRESIDENT'S MEN, ALIVE is a welcome recommendation to add to such a collection.

In fact, by the time they were rescued they looked to have been on a skiing trip and merely forgotten to shower for a day or two.If you want the real experience, read the book -- there, you will come to feel for the characters, and will feel their pain and suffering, trials, tribulations and triumphs and will sympathize when they die.

For those others who have read it the one they appoint as leader in the film 'Antonio' in the book the only person who has the name Antonio is Viztintin and he is portrayed by another actor. Also in the book the captain of the team is called Marcelo Perez. Another confusion i have is with the supposedly mad engineer. Who is he? And was that just for dramatisation purposes? Surely this book does not need anything added to it!Lastly i was a bit disappointed they did not show the point when Parrado and Canessa meet with the first people and also their first meal. Another amazing part of the book was when they meet their families again. Also a disappointment. Also, understandably, the search effort by their parents was left out as a two hour film can only be so long, i understand why it was not included.

I even cant think that if i am under the same4 circumstances i will have to eat dead human flesh, how i could do it, but when you are caught in such condition you must do whatever possible if you want to live. Some of the few died gradually not able to cope with harsh winter and some succumb to their injuries. But others decide to take measures to find a way out even in that remote high snow capped mountains and they really found their mark which led them out with remaining survivors. What i also observe that they turned to one person only,, THE GOD. God itself is some one who gives you power courage and will to fight , to live. What happened to them was the will of god and god itself brought them out of it. We are told when god considers some one his dearest one then it puts him under a test but one should pray to him not to test me because god ' s test is never easy one. every man/woman is not strong enough to pass it. But if you are really facing such circumstances believe in your heart that it is god ' will , he is always with me , he will be there for me even after my demise, he has put me in it and he will put me out of it , he never forsaken his people even they forget him.

Hopkins choice of scripts, Cannibalism is more of an adjunct than the theme to this one. Tastefully, ethically, and spiritually argued for only a few minutes and invites the viewer to consider what you would do in their shoes. The real story is about a diverse group of personality types interactions while finding themselves in horrific circumstances and forced to make difficult choices in order to survive. The over all tone is sensitive and moving, with a large but balanced focus on spiritual values. The soundtrack is perfection for the scenes, the end tune will move you to the edge of joyful tears if you are a person of faith. The cinematography in difficult low contrast exterior and low lux interior scenes is literally award winning and to be studied by any Video/Cine aspirant. To the viewer, completely non distracting, unlike other limited budget productions. There is a distracting amount of lack of annunciation in the dialogue which makes some phrases though naturally delivered emotionally, sound mumbled or slurred almost to the point of unintelligibility. Turn up the volume to solve this. There is a liberal sprinkling of humor (sometimes macabre) to counterpose the severity of their plight. As well as a couple of cliffhanger incidents not mentioned in the book. Conversational profanity is also liberal. The location set is awesome, and the special effects are superb, though NOT RECOMMENDED if you fear flying. Mostly true to the book other than a few name changes, and misappropriations of events to different persons than those stated in the book. The book is far more detailed on all aspects of the story, and if first read, better illuminates a few scenes where the viewer otherwise is scratching their head wondering what's that about? The film makes better sense and continuity immediately after reading the book. On whole an uplifting heroic film that I enjoy viewing at least once a year. The casting is good with many attractive unknowns and where are they nows. The acting with only a brief exception or two is excellent. Not for children under thinking teens, squeamish, or aerophobics. A true Classic that will encourage lazy readers to learn what sitting down with a good book is all about. The book, while more comprehensive is more of a documentary tone. Whereas the film captures the drama well and does not come across as a documentary. A must have for the DVD collection, as well as bookshelf. If you get the DVD version watch the Bonus Material. In the included documentary story ALIVE 20 YEARS LATER there is a brief moment where the real life Nando comforts the real life Carlitos, in front of the actor portraying Carlitos (Bruce Ramsay). It says everything in an instant about their ordeal and bonding, and how possibly the others also unspokenly felt about Nando, and literally looked to him for courage. No acting there at all. Pure reality. A very touching moment. If you want to see the awesome starkness of the afterwards named Glacier of Tears on the flanks of the Tinguiririca Volcano where they actually crashed in the Andes watch the RETURN TO THE ANDES bonus.All in all a highly entertaining and masterfully scored and cine'd 2 hour trailer that will induce you to go out and buy the book. That's when the entire story falls into place. Not a criticism of the film really, as it is impossible to squeeze the vast anecdotes, character backgrounds, family search efforts, and after rescue decompression found in the book into just two hours. The film does an excellent job of getting the pathos of the actual on mountain experience across.<><><><><><><><><> POSSIBLE SPOILER FOLLOWS <><><><><><><><><><><><><Splitting Hairs FYI on the Goofs portion of the film outline page here at IMDb, whoever posted that goofed in saying the altimeter reads 2000 feet. Any pilot can confirm that the Altimeter is the gauge in the top left of the last scene showing gauges. It reads 12,500 feet. The short hand points to the 1 for 10,000 ft., the middle length hand points between the 2 and 3 (like a clock moves) for an additional 2,000 ft., and the long hand points to the 5 for 500 ft., add all together for 12,500 feet. The height of the ridge they first impacted on in reality. If you single frame you see that the altimeter actually climbs about 20 feet right before they had impact, as would be expected and is accurately portrayed in the final pitching up of the plane trying to clear the ridge. This is exactly as Nando Parrado has said it happened. The top right gauge is an analog multi-revolution airspeed indicator with a digital Mach meter only found on military aircraft, It is able to be calibrated for local barometric pressure by the knob in its lower left which may lead the unwary to think it was an altimeter. As the actual Fairchild that crashed in the saga was also a military variant, that is real internal continuity, even though there are many other errors between the screenplay and the book. HOWEVER, there is a genuine Goof in the opening John Malkovich as older Carlitos narrative. In the pause after he says . . . how you'll behave, a highlight plays across his face and stops on his nose, then continues, only to whip across again a second later. Maybe they had a bet as to how many takes it would take, and someone was trying to get John to break form. Didn't work, not even the slightest squint or flinch from him there. That's stoic discipline! Why they didn't retake??? Maybe John's cameo was billed by the minute and they couldn't afford another $5,000 to retake. That's Hollywood!!! LOL just kidding John.

The actors were not spoiled with warm hotel rooms and room service. They all had tents and sometimes filming stopped due to bad weather. I especially admire the original survivors who helped consult with the making of the movie. Looking at an exact replica of the crash site, must have brought back some hard memories for them.If you like encouraging movies, also consider watching National Geographic's The Height of Courage A Norman Vaughn Story.On an interesting side note, the search plane they show in the movie is a Cessna 310T (twin prop).

My biggest problem is that the screenplay tends to play fast and loose with some of the facts of the book. First of all, nearly every name of every person lost on the mountain is changed. I do not know if this was done for legal reasons, but it seemed unnecessary and disingenuous. A bigger problem is the way in which events and facts are re-arranged to be attributed to Ethan Hawke's character, Nando Parrado. While I accept that this may have needed to be done in order to create a lone hero scenario, it downplays the contributions of others. Which brings me to my biggest problem, the complete disregard for the society which evolves among the survivors. The movie is written to attribute sole leadership to Parrado after the Vincent Spano character (Antonio Balbi, real name Marcelo Perez) is broken by the desperation of the situation. Nearly every other major character other than Parrado, Roberto Canessa, and Carlios Paez is ignored. While the book emphasizes the roles of Fito Strauch, Eduardo Strauch and Daniel Fernandez, their characters are reduced to mere side notes with Eduardo Strauch portrayed as frightened and nearly broken. Overall, I found the movie to be overly sterilized and cliché in certain parts. The movie does save itself by staying true to the major events. The plane crash is exactly how it was described in the book, as well as the avalanche. The depiction of Parrado's mania to escape is excellent. Still, the escape of Parrado and Canessa should have been given more time. The film moves very quickly and an additional fifteen minutes devoted to the trek through the Andes would have served the story much better. The cinematography is excellent.

I think this would have detracted from the experience the Rugby team had, the total isolation they felt, wondering if they would ever be found or would ever get out of the Andes. Showing the search for the Fairchild would lead viewers, especially those unfamiliar with the story, to believe that those who survived did so because they were found. Since, Nando and Roberto were ultimately the ones who got helped and saved the rest, showing efforts made by parents and rescue teams would be a bit unnecessary. It is inspiring to read the book Alive and to see the lengths the parents of Carlitos and Roberto, and other friends and relatives went through to find their children. Their hope even through hopelessness was inspiring. Talking more about the film, the crash scene was realistic, some but not all of the acting shoddy, but that didn't matter. What a great ending scene with Aaron Neville singing Ave Maria as the camera pans over a cross set in the rocks of the Andes. Miracle in the Andes by Nando Parrado is a good read as well, gives you the perspective on the survivor who, along with Canessa made it out of the mountains and saved his friends.

In LOST, the plane is shredded (actual crash not seen) but the survivors come out with the odd scratch. In Alive, the crash is graphically depicted, and even though the plane's hull remained largely intact, there were numerous very serious injuries amongst the survivors, in several cases directly leading to death.The current IMDb tagline They were ordinary young men driven to the very limits of human endurance is putting it mildly. I thought a better (though no doubt tasteless) tagline would have been, If I die, you can eat me. There is a marked reluctance to focus on this unsavoury aspect of the event (DVD covers do not mention it) though clearly it was key to the survival of the some half who did ultimately make it through those terrible 72 days.

There are many true life stories of survival that have been put on the big screen, but this has to be one of the most harrowing & disturbing. The film tells the story of an American rugby team becoming stranded in the Andes. At first it seems to be a straight forward matter of waiting to be rescued, but when supplies run out the survivors resort to eating their dead. This is indeed the major shock value of the movie, but the viewer soon finds themself accepting the situation.There are two major flaws to this movie. Firstly, for first half of the film the people simply await a rescue, thus there is an extremely sombre atmosphere to the story, with nothing to lighten it. Secondly, there is little character development, and no identifiable bonds between any of the characters, something essential to making a story like this become more than just true. Later on, the mood is lifted somewhat, and by the end of the film there is an enormous sense of hope and expectance that is truly exhilarating.If you can sit through the first half of Alive, then you will be rewarded somewhat.

School-bus accident at a railroad crossing or the sole survivor of a California plane crash, that sort of thing.  The latter story was filmed for TV & starred Blair Brown.  It was good but it doesn't hold a candle to 1993's Alive, directed with gusto by Frank Marshall.  Led by Ethan Hawke as Nando Parrado, this is not only a great tale of real-life survival, but one of great religious faith and courage.  It's based on Piers Paul Read's bestseller of the same name and digests the day-by-day happenings of these young South American survivors beautifully.  Unlike the Mexican exploitation flick Survive!, nor even the book itself, it does not dwell on the cannibalism which kept these people, mostly men in their early 20's, alive and kicking, in spirit if not physical strength.  True to form, most of the 16 survivors (out of an original 45) went on to respectable and successful lives with wives and children to extend themselves.  I really admire Nando Parrado; I think he's one of the great civillian leaders of our generation and Hawke plays him same.

It seems impossible that anyone survived the crash through what is depicted in the film, but it shows how the Rugby team made it out of the Andes alive. I really loved how the film jumped right into the story and didn't delay the movie by including unnecessary information. We get a look at what kind of people the members of the team were in about the first four minutes. That is enough time to understand what is going to happen to them and to build up a little sympathy for them. I hate how movies have those huge intros with the credits and loud music working up to the first scene and that is probably why I liked this film, especially during the first ten minutes. The plane goes down and we have the remaining two hours or some to focus on who dies, how the survivors made it to Chile and what the emotions and feelings were inside the doomed airplane. The run time was good. In some parts the film seemed to drag with nothing going on but that was how it actually was. Making it shorter wouldn't have covered all of the information that was needed to be covered but making it longer would just have been too much. Most viewers comment on how the acting was so poorly done, but again I enjoyed almost everybody in 'Alive.' I absolutely love Ethan Hawke and Josh Hamilton. Hawke does an excellent job of portraying Nando Parrado. Hamilton is also terrific as Roberto Canessa. With these two in the lead roles, the film can't be bad. But hey, that's just my opinion. All of the actors were good in their own way. They all developed an atmosphere for the audience that really makes you feel sorry for them. Even the actors who didn't deliver a whole lot of lines added something special with what they had to work with. Re-creating the plane crash was nicely done. The special effects department didn't go overboard and ruin the film by throwing in all of those expensive, computerized animations that made it look like some kind of a space movie. I can't really comment on any certain part of the recreation of the plane crash because it was all terrific. The setting that was used to make it look like the freezing yet peaceful and calm Andes mountains was nicely designed. I think that another writer said that the film was in some way botched because the actors didn't act too well in the 'cold' scenes. An area where the temperature dropped so low didn't even leave these guys shivering or acting like they were in discomfort. Alright, I'll give you that much. While these scenes may need a little work on, I thought that they were minor. They were hardly noticeable and I don't think that they ruined the film in any way.Now you have those people who are going to turn their heads when the team finally settles on cannibalism. The film didn't show a whole lot and they didn't need to. I thought that the movie handled this subject decently.All in all, 'Alive' is an excellent movie that tells the story of a doomed airliner and how the passengers deal with the problems and eventually survive the awful crash. I haven't read the book and I really don't see the need. I understand what happened to the team members because the film described it in a certain way that most stories can't be told.

The men who left the crash site to get help (and to tell the world that they shouldn't have called off the search) would lie on top of each other to try to keep warm and their hands were so frozen that they would urinate on them because their urine was warm and it was such a relief on their hands. Imagine having to do that yourself, and you might, you just might find yourself grateful that you never have had to go through what they had to go through. It was also sad to see, in the '20 years later' documentary, that when they were rescued and brought back to civilization, they were criticized for eating their friends. You'd think that the people they were returning to would be happy and grateful to see them come back and admire them for having the courage (it took a lot of courage-think of how long they debated over whether to do it or not and the arguments that it caused)...the courage to do whatever it took to stay ALIVE.

I picked up a copy after much searching and relished the chance to see the amazing events (especially the crash itself) portrayed on screen.I have to say that I was mildly impressed. The movie stays fairly true to real life and is well made. Considering that they had a few of the actual survivors assist with the production, I trust the integrity of how the characters, crash, and other details were presented. The crash scene in the beginning is pretty well done (especially for 1992) and the story can't help but be pretty gripping, which means that a lot of complaints like an unrealistic plot can be thrown out the window, because the plot already happened. The circumstances alone keep you on the edge of your seat during this movie. Heck, I even knew who was going to die and when, but I still found it exciting to see how these things were portrayed. There were a few parts that I found fault with in the movie. A couple characters were altered and some combined with others to form a new, fake character. I just have to assume that this was done to make the story more compatible for a film version. Also, there were a couple characters who died in real life that are portrayed as having survived in the movie, and some of the deaths in the movie seemed kind of unfitting, and undignified, especially for a movie based on REAL EVENTS with REAL PEOPLE. I like to think that the survivors who were assisting gave their consent that the representations were accurate. However, on top of all this, portions of the movie were left out. There is no reference to the mini-government that was formed by the survivors. Also, the search made by the parents, and a large portion of the final expedition are left out. Once again, I have to assume that the producers had their reasons. Overall, this is a solid, thrilling, and well made account of the Andes Miracle. Some things were changed here and there, and substantial parts of the actual events were left out, but its still a decent movie all the same. 7/10 stars "},{"Title":"Amazing true story emphasizes spiritual aspects","Date":"1 June 2005","Score":"1 out of 3 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Adventure, Biography, Drama","Review":" ALIVE Aspect ratio 1.851Sound format Dolby DigitalIn 1972, members of a Uruguayan rugby team are trapped in the Andes when their charter plane crashes in the mountains, killing many of those on board. Unable to overcome their situation any other way, the survivors are forced to contemplate the unthinkable - to eat the dead...Though the cannibalism aspect of this extraordinary true story had formed the backbone of an earlier exploitation movie (René Cardona's opportunistic 1976 Mexican thriller SURVIVE!), Frank Marshall's dignified Hollywood version - based on Piers Paul Read's bestselling book - places a deliberate emphasis on the survivors' spiritual response to their ordeal. Opening with a horrific plane crash (an effects tour de force) which places viewers at the heart of an appalling catastrophe, the film quickly settles into a matter-of-fact account of the protagonists' daily struggle to stay alive, though some of the dialogue sounds a little forced and unrealistic.Handsomely mounted on location in the Canadian Rockies, the movie is toplined by some of Hollywood's brightest (and most photogenic) young talents, including Ethan Hawke (DEAD POETS SOCIETY), Josh Hamilton (THE HOUSE OF YES) and Vincent Spano (CITY OF HOPE), with capable support from Jack Noseworthy (CECIL B.

A notable example is the depiction of Roberto Canessa,who,in the book Alive is a complex and slightly volatile character. The very duality of Canessa who is both aggressive and bullying and at the same time frightened and vulnerable,physically and emotionally, makes him compelling and memorable. I also felt the film trivialized the bravery and heroics of Parrado and Canessa's astonishing trek out of the mountains. The film shows us nothing of the ten day journey which made the rescue occur.

These were privileged yuppie kids with attitude who were on a winter jaunt while the rest of us were toiling at our 3 jobs to put ourselves through college! The great thing about the film is it doesn't smooth over their idiocy. Everyone in it is selfish. Everyone is egotistical. The pleasure is in watching them one by one bite it! So, if you like movies where horrible teenagers get torn apart by monsters (Jaws, Halloween, House) you'll enjoy this film! I can't think of a better group of selfish individuals to have something like this happen to!! Too bad any survived.

Death stalks and kills repeatedly. It is not clear what should be done to effect rescue, and the characters are all rather silly, incompetent, spoiled, rowdy, young men who have not even the sense to cover their heads in the cold, or set out markers to make them easy to spot. It is so frustrating mentally shouting instructions to these young twits telling them what to do. Of course they pay no attention. You feel the terror, the boredom, the indecision, the despair and the frustration. Of course there is the famous revulsion and acceptance at eating raw human corpses. After an initial freak out, it becomes no big deal.Different characters react in quite different ways to their predicament. Some go into a rapture about what a wonderful religious experience it is. Their fellows want to box them. Others go plain crazy. Others become extremely selfish. Others just want to die.What infuriated me was the flat-footed Christian propaganda behind this supposedly true-life film suggesting a beneficent God was behind all this pulling the strings. It was almost as manipulative as an episode of Touched By Angel with the back light and harp music.I'm fine with showing pious characters, but please don't force feed me Catholic Christian cant. That heavy handedness ruined an otherwise great and touching film.

A tale of a plane crash, human survival, 2 survivors scaling the Andes to save their colleagues and cannibalism has a lot of scope for a good film, but this does not deliver.A decidedly poor performance from Ethan Hawke in which he is often particularly cheesey is only saved by in what some cases are very good special effects.

It's obvious that the movie was trying to get across an important message, and inform us of a little known event, but the actual movie is unbearable and nearly impossible to watch.		The acting is relatively mediocre. It's nothing more than passable, boring, with little interest on the part of the actors. It's not all their fault, however, as the script and weak direction likely were the determining factors on whether the performances would sustain our interest, or not.	The only bright spot is the relatively standard scenery which stands out and looks magnificent because of the other aspects. When put up against the cinematography in a film like 'Titanic', the scenery in 'Alive' would look horrendous, but here it works on at least one level, attempting to fix the movie, but it never quite reaches that.	The special effects (during the crash) are also simple, not at all remarkable and at times almost laughable. It's as if whoever was in charge of the fx department didn't care enough to put much time into the project.	Save yourself two hours of wasted time and skip out on this stinker, rent 'The Edge' or even 'Cliffhanger' instead. Even if you were paid to watch it, it might not be worth the effort.0.5/10  "},{"Title":"Has Its Moments But I Wish I Fast Forwarded Through A lot Of It","Date":"5 September 2010","Score":"1 out of 8 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Adventure, Biography, Drama","Review":" From the time i heard comedian Carlos Mencia do a short sketch on this movie i had the incentive to one day watch it, that day was today. You cant help but feel a compassion for humanity when watching this film. It grips your inner core of what it means to take care of your fellow man/woman. However, i disliked the emphasis on praying god save us, help us oh divine invisible man throughout the movie. Took the fun away. Then again i could be dubbed biased since I'm an atheist. Whats funny about the cast is a few of the male actors sounded female in their voice which was odd, i dunno if that was intentional. Back to the film the ever growing paranoia, using religious faith as a scapegoat, coming face to face with nature's cold mannerisms, resorting to emotional last resorts, and descending slowly into madness all paints a pretty descent 2 hours.Conclusion OK film, has its moments but i kinda wish i fast forwarded through a lot of it. The story telling seemed very slow paced for me to really get into. Also, the main plot seems to have been executed too lightheartedly and not given full justice to become more memorable as the real event probably was. More of a documentary style of filming, i guess its up to each of us to make of it what we will under our own interpretation. Hence why i give this a mere 6 out of 10.

By apes, maybe...MAYBE","Date":"31 July 2009","Score":"2 out of 10 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Adventure, Biography, Drama","Review":" I settled in to watch this recently on HBO because I always found the Andes crash story ghoulishly interesting and was really surprised I hadn't seen it upon initial release.My first red flag was the Touchstone (Disney) logo. The Touchstone imprint was responsible for some truly maudlin goo in the '80s and '90s. Still, not all their movies stunk. Remember Splash and Never Cry Wolf? Then the plane crash...not bad, actually. Maybe there's hope yet, despite the fact that most of the cast doesn't look SA in the least. It's not a documentary or foreign art house film...it's a big budget commercial release.Then the GQ party-boy models-cum-actors open their mouths post crash and attempt some serious acting. Red alert opening your eyes really wide and walking around stiffly is not sufficient to constitute playing someone in shock. When the kid with the metal sticking out of his chest nonchalantly jokes about his severe trauma wound the movie enters a surreal, almost Mystery Science Theatre level of self-parody. Unfortunately, it never returns from that dubious pinnacle.The only credible actors here (aside from John Malkovich's brief cameo) are Illeana Douglas and Ethan Hawke, and both have far little relative screen time to save this picture.See, the problem with Alive is not the niggling picky details like the holes and implausibilities of the script. If only it were that minor! This is a movie with horrible, horrible acting, stiff line readings, and manufactured histrionics that would put most prime-time soaps to shame. It's got overstated music and Frank Marshall's leaden career-producer-hand at the till to drive it further into the ground.At a 135 minute running time, the cannibalism becomes one of the most palatable things on the menu.

ALIVE is based on actual events but is never as good as it should have been , though it`s never as bad as it  could have been either.The problem I had with the film was that I found it very difficult to relate to the survivors , not because they eat the flesh of the dead - Thankfully this aspect of the film is treated with dignity - but because their characters are so sketchily written. The other problem is that the production team seem to have forgot that it`s set thousands of feet up the Andes! The night after the crash the survivors nearly freeze to death but by the end of the film some of them are sitting around without their jackets on ! Just how warm does it get up there ?All in all ALIVE  is adequate but doesn`t make us share the feelings of the survivors triumph. For that to happen we must feel we`re there with the survivors freezing and starving.

You really have to see it to believe it. And what's up with the total lack of realism in this near-7-rated meagre excuse for a movie? Is it normal for plane passengers to resemble a bunch of people watching a re-run of Bonanza while the plane is being ripped apart mid-air? Is it normal for someones breath to be visible at minus whatever degrees from the right camera-angle but not from the left? Is it normal for a bunch of people who just crashed with a plane to be mostly completely calm and lucid? Is it normal for a guy with agonizingly painful wounds to only scream when the camera is there?I had a good laugh throughout the first 20 minutes of this movie but I hadn't planned on watching a comedy, making it sheer ejectbutton-material.If you liked this one, I suggest you go see 'Airplane' as well. It's got better jokes in it.This film getting a rating of 6.8 is insulting to movies that actually deserve that. Shame on u voters!

They are that good, they actually pull off a fine American accent.I usually try to find something positive in a movie, unfortunately Alive is not one of them.

But the real film is actually a pretty good film with an unthinkable idea, but if it keeps you alive, then I suppose it's okay. Basically students travelling in a plane go over the Andes mountains, and they crash. There are 27 survivors, and they are trying everything they can to survive and get help. When they get really hungry and the rescuers presume their dead, they decide that they have to eat the (frozen) skin of the dead to stay alive.

Imagine the thrill of being trapped in a claustrophobic, monotonous, icy environment!  Of hearing the condescending platitudes of colleagues!  Of freezing or starving to death!  The excitement of cannibalism!Aside from the movie's just plain awfulness, the story isn't exactly timely -- much less in need of re-telling, and it completely overlooks the fact that the victims weren't commiserating in English.  It is an irredeemably huge waste of time. "}]
