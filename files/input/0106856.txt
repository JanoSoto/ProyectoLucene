[{"Title":"An important look at the decay of society","Date":"9 June 1999","Score":"265 out of 296 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Crime, Drama, Thriller","Review":" Falling Down is the kind of film that has much more more happening than many of us want to know about. It is disguised simply as a film about an apparent nut who goes out and tries to right the wrongs that have been done to him and in his trek across Los Angeles he becomes an anti-hero. While that may be true to an extent, read more into it and you can see a film that tries to show us that there is something terribly wrong with how we live. I wasn't alive in the 50's, in fact, I was born in the 70's. So I can't honestly tell you if life was easier back then. But what I can tell you is that times were a bit more simple then. For the most part, you had one income in the household. You had T.V and radio as your entertainment and kids went outside to play. Now you must have both parents working so you can have that double income. Kids are obsessed with the internet and videogames and so on. What does all of this have to with the film? Everything!Falling Down is about the decay in one man's life and how it affects not only him but those around him. There is one very powerful scene in the film that can sum up everything.There is a key moment in Falling Down that is sad in it's reality, but true in it's opinion. Douglas is in a surplus store and the guy running it is a Nazi sympathizer. When Douglass doesn't share his opinions, they get into a confrontation. The guy snaps and tells Douglas to spread against the wall. He obliges and then the Nazi guy wants to handcuff him. He tells Douglas to give him his hand, he does. Then he tells Douglas to give him his other hand. Douglas is supporting himself on the wall in a 30 degree angle and if he gives the guy his other hand  he'll fall down.  Which is precisely what he tells the Nazi guy. This is a microcosm of the film and a microcosm of what may be wrong with not only society but people in general. There is a theory in wrestling that your arms and legs are like a table, if you take out any two of the legs or arms, your opponent falls down and is vulnerable. Same thing with a human being. Take away so many of his limbs ( job, wife, dignity, credit rating, kids, etc. ) and it may be only a matter of time before that person does snap. This movie shows us what happens to one individual that does snap. He wasn't all that bad to begin with, but as time went on and he was  lied  to, he can't handle it and finally one day, he has had enough. I think this film is more important than people realize and if you have only seen it once, see it again. You may see something that you didn't see before. Hats off to Schumacher and Douglas who had the guts to make this film.

Then add the frustrations of having an estranged wife and child, an extremely jaded and unbalanced mindset, and the frustration of being obsolete with no marketable skills. Set them against the decadent back drop of modern day LA where if you are 'Not economically viable,' you are of no use, and the result is Falling Down.The tag line 'The Adventures of an Ordinary man at War with the Everyday World,' makes Joel Schumacher's masterpiece sound like the benign story of a working stiff with issues. However Falling Down is a dark and engrossing urban fable, a study into the mind of the disenfranchised and reminder to all that the removal of comfort is a lot closer than we care to believe.Full of clich√©s, like the cop on his last day before retiring, Falling Down bravely meets all expectations of stereotypes, rather than challenging them, making for a realistic reflection of a failing society. Here, a man in extremis, without the feral cunning or killer instinct required for a life in the street, makes his way on anger and luck alone, somehow surviving to leave a paper chase of violence and destruction behind.Relying heavily on symbolism, illustrating a flip side of America running parallel to the hunky dory world occupied by the successful, the over all message of 'No Matter, Never Mind,' is clear in this world where children play next to vagrants dying from AIDS and Korean grocers can legally steal from the public with their overpriced goods.Michael Douglas displays some hitherto unseen talent as the unbalanced D-FENS, as he casually totes gang weapons (complete with rubber bands on the grips) in his formal shirt and tie, does battle with store owners and comes up against fast food restaurants, homeless people, gangsters and Nazis. Robert Duval is equally brilliant as the desk jockey on his final day, determined to stop anyone else from being hurt, including the perp.There is, of course, a small amount of Hollywood sentimentality thrown in for good measure, however the dynamics of such a strong narrative make this completely forgivable and it's possible to overlook this as a flaw given the film's overall strengths.Praise surely has to go to Ebbe Roe Smith for writing one of the finest scripts ever to grace celluloid. Known for bit parts and cameos, who the hell knows who Ebbe really is? Look on IMDb to find out (if you're a geek like me) or release him into the ether if you don't care. The truth is, he's out there. The question is Where's the next script?On the whole, Falling Down is a powerful and dramatic indictment of American culture, societal decadence, and the failing values of the West. It's not for everyone and will most certainly offend some, but if approached with an open mind, will provide plenty of fuel for thought.

It succeeds in doing so, but one must look carefully.  Each situation Bill Foster (Michael Douglas) faces is one that most people can relate to.  However, unlike most people he decides to fight the system and wage war on the everyday annoyances that we all face.  Foster is a People's Champion.  To illustrate this, most people who watch this film naturally pull for him and see him as being a hero, mostly out of pure sympathy.  However, at the end of the day, Foster is still the bad guy for going against the societal grain.  Most viewers will find this upsetting or even unfair, considering that he fought back against many criminals and unjust forces.  Where Falling Down fails at times is during the scenes where it attempts to do too many things at once.  The bits of humor throughout the film are mostly derived from over-the-top scenes, and at times Foster's actions seem cheesy and unrealistic.  The fact that the film is two stories in one (Foster and Prendergast) provides a good contrast because the viewer gets to see both sides of the story.  On one hand, we see an ordinary family man going bezerk (but in a way most of us can understand) and on the other hand we see a cop who believes Foster is a complete psychopath.  Only the audience knows the truth.  The film could have done without some of the lame subplots such as Duvall's marriage, even though those scenes illustrate his perception of being weak or whipped.  The film sets out to do a lot at once, which is quite necessary to create a thorough storyline, but at times doesn't come out right on film.One scene that I have always found moving and powerful is the scene where Bill Foster sees the man who is Not Economically Viable protesting outside of the bank that denied him a loan.  As everyone on the busy street goes about their business and ignores this man, Foster (and the viewer) are focused directly on him.  Foster obviously sympathizes with this poor, hardworking man who is also being stepped on by society.  As the man is escorted away in the police car he looks directly at Foster and says don't forget me.  In a gesture of sympathy and appreciation, he nods to him.  The two characters share a connection.  It is especially important to notice the symbolism of this scene.  Both men are wearing the exact same outfits a white short-sleeved dress shirt, black tie and black pants.  They are on the opposite sides of the street.  When they look at each other, even though they are white and black, it is as though they are looking into a mirror and seeing the same thing a victim of society.Overall, a slightly sad story that tries to do a whole lot, succeeds in most of it and provides lots of entertainment.  A good storyline and an excellent observation of modern society.

Falling Down may have a few incredibilities (though I remember going through a lot of situations in the film Douglas went through-though I never was angry enough to pull a shotgun out), but it's more symbolic than anything. I think the funniest part is the burger restaurant, obviously a mimic of McDonalds, and Douglas' reaction. It's kind of like he realizes, Hey, I'm this far, why not complain about the burger while I'm at it? It's always bugged me anyway!

The whole scene  with Douglas in the fast food restaurant was  priceless, giving a voice to the typical angry  consumer.

Having been pushed past the brink of sanity, Foster loses it and storms out of his car, walking around town and trying desperately to see his little daughter for her birthday, a daughter who is untouchable because of a court order against him by his estranged wife. Along the way, Foster will run across character types we've all come across the 'war veteran' bum who is really just a lowlife looking to score some quick cash, an irate Korean grocery store owner, a homophobic neo-nazi army retail store owner, a crusty elitist country club golf player, super friendly fast food workers, young Hispanic thugs, and so forth. And each one will chip away at what remains of his patience and tolerance for stupidity, fueling a rampage.Up against this anti-hero is Prendergast, a veteran cop who has felt many of the same pains as Foster, but who serves as sort of a foil to him. Foster has lost everything, and while Prendergast has lost quite a bit (his wife is a basketcase, his little daughter died years ago under mysterious circumstances), he still retains some optimism, calmness, and dignity. As Prendergast, who is on his last day on the job, begins to put together the pieces of the mysterious crime spree plaguing the city (he seems to be the only one smart enough to figure out it's all the doing of one man!), it pits him in an inevitable confrontation between him and Foster.Michael Douglas, playing Foster / D-FENS plays an incredibly complex character. On the one hand, you know much of what he does is so wrong, but at the same time there's immense satisfaction at seeing him lash out at those deserving of it. And while he tries to stay calm, he finds himself constantly provoked by those who have 'wronged society.' In fact, many of the things he does could so easily have been avoided if the 'victims' were not so positively despicable. You can't help but feel at the end of the day, when Foster gets his due, that he's, in some small way, made Los Angeles a better place despite the carnage he's unleashed.And this is perhaps what is so strange about the movie. There seems to be no clear message. Who was right? Who was wrong? It becomes a very blurry line over the approximately 2 hours of the movie's run. I've seen it now several times and I still can't give any definitive answer. Perhaps this is a strength, that different people will view this movie in different ways. Some will see this as the story of a noble, decent man who modern society has beaten down and crushed, and who desperately tries to struggle against the tyranny and betrayal. Others will see Foster as a lunatic who needed to be put down. No one, I think, will find that Foster doesn't warrant some sympathy.Personally, I think Foster got the wrong end of the stick. His wife's anger and fear of him seems somewhat unwarranted, and though it is clear that Foster (and not just society itself) has brought many of his problems upon his own head, he is tired and angry and rightfully resentful at the course his life has taken. He feels he has nothing to live for, so he takes it out on anyone who crosses his path. I recommend this movie because the performances are all-around great, it delivers a solid cast, and as the portrayal of one man's journey down the path of madness, few have done better.Grade A-  "},{"Title":"great film","Date":"7 July 2003","Score":"63 out of 81 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Crime, Drama, Thriller","Review":"  It's just not William Foster's (Michael Douglas) day.

He also slowly loses it, finally snapping at a fast food restaurant (a spoof of McDonald's) that refuses to serve him breakfast because he was late. Foster also known as D-FENS because of his custom license plate quickly becomes a source of terror to some, a hero to others. It's up to hesitant cop Prendergast (Robert Duvall), on the eve of retirement, to bring Foster down. Douglas and Duvall nail their roles within this well written movie.

Well, Leonard, I'll tell you. FALLING DOWN is a critique of violence and aggression in America, particularly - but not limited to - white heterosexual males. The point of the movie is to demonstrate that America falsely celebrates itself as a land of opportunity and a melting pot; rather, it's a powder keg of selfishness, arrogance, and prejudice that can cause anyone to snap for any reason.The movie suggests that this anger is learned at a young age through the media. Notice how the daughter of D-Fens (Michael Douglas) is playing with a water gun while watching violent cartoons. And of course, there is the boy who immediately assumes D-Fens is filming a movie because he has a bazooka. The boy then teaches him how to use the weapon because he saw it on TV.But the film doesn't lay the blame entirely on the media. It also covers the psychological aspect of violence, namely the impact of a person's work and family life on their state of mind. The movie perfectly shows how one can affect the other, while both affect the whole person. D-Fens was divorced, unemployed, and raised by a weirdly obsessive-compulsive mother (Lois Smith). His life - empty and routine - turned him into some kind of machine, as she put it. Meanwhile, Prendergast (Robert Duvall) had become a human punching bag at his job, picked on at work the same way he was picked on at home. It's only with the help of his sympathetic partner (Rachel Ticotin) that Prendergast is finally able to stand up to his co-workers and his wife. Sucker-punch notwithstanding, he used more appropriate forms of aggression than D-Fens did. Overall, this is a brilliant film with a lot to say about the violent and angry times we live in. It should really be seen by everyone.

Nearly every one of his films is an exercise in flashy stylistics with not a single thing to say. Look no further than his Batman films. But on one occasion, he managed to rise above his desire for eye-candy overkill. And produce something really worthwhile. And Falling Down was that film.Falling Down would have to be the best film out of Schumacher's mostly awful body of work. Its the one thing he's ever done where he actually forgets about battering an audience into submission with glorious light effects and pretty costumes and sets. He's produced a violent story to be sure. But a curiously humane one too. And Michael Douglas is its human centre.Douglas plays Bill Foster, a defence worker of seven years who gets laid off. He spends the next month and a half trying to make sense of the tattered shreds of his life. He's a man with no job. No wife and daughter because they've cut him out of their lives. And most importantly, he's a man without purpose.But on one particularly hot day in LA, he finds a purpose. The opening scene is filled with glaringly aggressive closeups of Douglas' face. Sweating and twitching. All while he's sitting in his car in the middle of an agonisingly slow traffic jam. You know something is coming. Something is about to erupt. And that thing is Bill. In a split-second he snaps, abandons his car and tells the baffled motorist behind him he's going home.Although Bill is indeed going home to his wife and daughter, he makes a few stops along the way. Bill has become so disillusioned by society's flaws and shortcomings, he feels a need to rectify it by lashing out at the mundane trappings of our everyday lives. With his crew-cut, white shirt and tie, briefcase in one hand and automatic weapon in the other, its Ordinary Joe meets GI Joe.Its hard to believe Falling Down came from the same director of mindless trash like Batman & Robin. This is an acutely observed portrait of the sorry state of our affairs. And Michael Douglas turns in a real showstopper of an acting performance. Its a style of acting brimming with raw honesty. He plays a man not at the mercy of madness, but someone who's grown accustomed to it. This is the film Michael Douglas should have won an Oscar for.The film is bold enough to portray Bill as an object of sympathy, even when he's committing shocking acts of violence. Bill is a middle aged man, who felt he was in control all of his life, and when everything that mattered to him fell to dust, it left him a broken man. His new mission gives him something to focus on, but I sense its not quite the liberating experience Bill envisioned it would be. Even when he tries to reassert control, his inherent emptiness still plagues him. What a brave, plaintively truthful performance!Falling Down has received a fair amount of criticism, especially from racial minorities, who have lambasted the film because Bill's targets appear to be Korean shopkeepers or Latino street gangs. It is easy to view it in that context. That Bill is nothing more than a walking megaphone venting his hatred towards foreigners. But that's too narrow a vision. Schumacher's direction is really more expansive then you realise.Yes he does trash the Korean's store, because he overcharges for a can of Coke, and Bill won't have enough change left over for the payphone. And yes he beats up Latino thugs. But these are just the bystanders along the way of Bill's inexorable journey. I don't think there's any intentional malice intended there.And Schumacher's direction is quite excellent. He stages self-contained vignettes that are tiny microcosms of what exactly is wrong with this world. Like the scene at the fast-food restaurant. A classic example of the bureaucratic red tape that deliberately sets out to entangle people like poor Bill. Who hasn't felt like standing up for they're rights as a consumer? Bill can't have breakfast because he's a few minutes late. These are the type of absurdities Bill is campaigning against.Falling Down works like a steadily unfolding carpet. And as Bill walks through the city of LA, he is wearing out the hollow material that its weaved from. There is a very natural flow to the film. Things fall into place quite beautifully. Such as when Bill makes the decision to carry a bag full of weapons instead of his normal briefcase. This is a man going through a steady metamorphosis from which there is no return.Some people have felt disappointed by the somewhat low-key ending. But I felt it couldn't have ended any other way. Its an ending of weary resignation. No matter how much Bill has tried to add meaning to his rootless existence, the truth is society may have to live with its flaws. No matter what Bill's efforts.One of the most daring films of the 90s, and any film that attempts to address society's failings with such frank honesty deserves strong commendation indeed.

Surrounded by people who also have to cope with it. Children shouting, drivers swearing, phoning, honking and other ways of bearing the waiting time. The cinematography is reflecting well the uneasiness of Foster as he sweats and seemingly looses his temper during the stay. Not being enough, a fly in his car makes him slap around aggressively while a little girl watches his movement from the backseat of a car as if she knew what dangerous potential of D-Fens Foster will show later on. Then he makes a decision He WILL leave this situation, leave the car and climb up the hill to go home...This is the starting point of Foster's mental falling down. It seems to be a strange behaviour to leave your car behind and escape from the jam. But to be honest - haven't you ever thought of just doing this?! Such a behaviour seems strange yet one could understand it as it means no real harm to anyone around him.Later, one gets to know that this man has lost his family, job and is not economically viable. In this hostile situation, thoughts about what you have forgone in your life may explain and defend this naive escape motivation. He escapes this dead-end - symbolized by a jam - to get home.In the next scene the sympathy towards the protagonist gets lost or changes into a feeling of unsettlement and pity. He might have just chilled out a few moments on the top of the hill/walked around to calm down and return to his car. But he does not. Instead, Foster get sucked into a maelstrom of aggression which he of course provokes.The movie is full of details about Foster's anger about society. A general anger which everyone has felt before but not uttered in such a direct and crude way. There are dozens of pictures of the decadence of the USA (a decadence which can be found in all western societies but to a special amount in the US) Overpriced goods in stores, gang-land area, people carrying guns (even automatic military weapons), the delusion of fast-food, racism, neo Nazis having their freedom, drug addicts, aids-suffering folk, beggars begging for money, D-Fens constructing weapons of mass destruction, divorce and a man not being allowed to see his child anymore, decadence of golf-sites, economically non-viable people,...... See for yourself your will find many examples throughout the film. And Foster is in the middle of it, realizing that this is not only unjust. He knows the he has also fallen victim of his surrounding society. Especially the scene where the cops get hold of the black guy protesting in the front of the bank is addressed to Foster. The police car stops and the protestant stares at Foster to tell him don't forget me. This scene seems to be Foster's point of no return. He won't forget, he will get his right to go home! In fact, it is a desperate right, a right of socially marginalized person, an illusion.Noteworthy is the way how Foster's potential violence comes to life. When he enters the Korean corner store the viewer does not realize that he will turn out to be a dangerous man with aggressive behaviour. Everything stars harmless when Foster just asks for change money to use a phone. It is the usual counter aggression of racism that drives Foster to use inappropriate measures. No change, you have to buy something. Foster hesitates but still accepts this silent offense by purchasing a coke. When he realizes that the price of this drink is exaggerated and will not leave enough money for his phone call he makes a last effort. He asks for 50 cents in exchange for a dollar (!). Even that offer is refused by clerk. Now Foster gives way to his anger and gets started about the inflicted rights of the consumers. His rage cumulates to point where the clerk feels unsafe and tries to produce a bat to force Foster out. Violence creates counter-violence and Foster gets hold of the bat palpability. Now having the power he interrogates the clerk of the prices of the other goods in the store relieving his anger on batting around in the corner store. But Foster never hits the clerk and finally even pays for the coke taking his change from the cash and leaving the store like a normal customer It was a pleasure of frequenting this establishment!.If you carefully revise this scene you see that it is not Foster who starts to be aggressive. It is an understandable reaction of his to get angry facing provocations like these. Also the way of taking out a weapon as a defence is inappropriate. Maybe a short palpability as reaction might not be seen as Foster's guilt. The situation gets out of hand. It seems to be an aggression based on racism of an Asian and white guy. But still the above mentioned sympathy for the protagonist is vanishing as his behaviour is unsettling. Foster's potential violence is present now. Nevertheless, the viewer is left with the feeling that Foster had a bad day and does not really want this.Michael Douglas plays Foster's psychotic development in a very plastic and authentic way. Douglas does not just emerge as a violent berserker. He reflects Foster's inner despair ambiguously Foster is not a man without feelings, yet, he is a man letting out too many feelings on the spot. Driven by his love for his daughter he fights his way through a hostile environment and society. He is only dangerous when people provoke him. He has lost his inhibition. Foster goes amok. In fact, this has happened several times in reality. Think about it.

Despite all the tumultuous events of the 20th Century, all the wars, technology, science, politics and the hard lessons, despite the brief optimism felt as the wall came down, the dream of a better world is still so far away.Most of the characters we meet along the way represent nations which, at some point in history, the USA has been at war with The Korean (economic), The Hispanics (land rights), the Nazis (ideology). We meet one solitary black man in the film, holding a banner which reads NOT ECOMINCALLY VIABLE. This speaks volumes and rams home the central message We looked abroad to solve problems while we ignored our own. The Whammy Burger Bar scene is a representation of the &#145;inflexible and misleading' corporate world (even the child can clearly see &#145;what's wrong with this picture'), it captures a dissatisfaction that has gained much momentum since 1993.Despite what was written in reviews of the time Douglas' character &#145;D-Fens' actually commits very few acts of violence in the film. The press yelled &#145;racist' too, but here's a story brave enough to avoid the token black-police-chief approach to race and show a world where everyone is potentially malicious. His mirror opposite in the story, played by Duvall, balances the bleak view of modern America nicely but, as we gradually discover how horrible and strange D-fens has become to his own wife and children, the film leaves thinking about how strange and horrible so much of American society has become.

Every single one of them has been entirely deserved. But those insults should be softened with just a little praise for making a bold urban nightmare like this film.Falling Down is the story of a man who is stuck in traffic one day when his tolerance for the world is finally used up. Identified only by his license plate D-Fens, the man (Michael Douglas) abandons his car and starts walking. He says he's going home, but where he's going isn't his home anymore. His ex-wife Beth and daughter Adele (Barbara Hershey and Joey Hope Singer) now live there and Beth has a restraining order against D-Fens. As he walks his way across Los Angeles, D-Fens has a series of violent encounters, first with the everyday aggravations of life in the big city. From busting up the shop of a immigrant merchant who speaks broken English to confronting some gang bangers to a gun point rant against the unctuous martinets at a fast food restaurant, D-Fens eventually graduates to more brutal acts against more existential frustrations like neo-Nazi gun nuts, pointless road construction and the vicious sense of entitlement among the wealthy. All the while, getting every closer to Beth and Adele.As reports of D-Fens' slow moving rampage come in, the only one to figure out what's going on is a cop spending his last day on the job. Detective Prendergast (Robert Duvall) is retiring early, an taking a reduced pension, to satisfy the demands of his insecure, needy and somewhat unstable wife. Aided by the only cop he's friends with (Rachel Ticotin), Prendergast sets out to stop D-Fens before this day turns out to be the last day in the life of a lot of people.Falling Down is a smart film that takes on two cultural phenomena of the early 1990s. One is the concept of going postal, where relatively normal men started going into their workplaces and shooting people. The other is the sense of economic disenfranchisement that came out of the recession that bridges the first Bush and Clinton Administrations. Now granted, as befitting a Joel Schumacher picture, this movie doesn't take those subjects on with any subtlety. But it does address them thoroughly with both empathy and honesty.Schumacher, Michael Douglas and screenwriter Ebbe Roe Smith combine to make D-Fens a character who defies easy definition. He's neither the righteous vigilante of right wing fantasies nor a liberal's easily dismissed symbol of white male intolerance. He's a man who can legitimately claim he's been victimized by society, yet he's also a man whose seething rage terrifies the ones closest to him. Most of the carnage he creates is accidental or without malice, yet his ultimate goal is the darkest sort of evil. D-Fens is someone you cannot completely embrace or reject. You can only wonder how much of yourself is reflected in him.The whole film is somewhat like that. Most of the characters, even minor ones, are given depth and personalities like they're real human beings and not just constructs serving the script. They experience genuine humor and friendship and anguish and fear in a way this sort of high-concept movie usually doesn't provide.The contrast between D-Fens and Prendergast that runs through the story is a great example of that kind of complexity. They're both guys whose lives aren't working out like they wanted. One has a failed marriage and a lost career, the other a dead daughter and a crazy wife he feels responsible for. The ways they deal with those challenges are quite different. D-Fens is an idealist who cares about the way he thinks things should be, at the expense of the other people in the world with him. Prendergast is a pragmatist who takes the world as it is and does what he has to do to get by, without even thinking it could be any other way.I suspect that Falling Down has not gotten the acclaim it deserves because it's a mainstream work of entertainment that won't fit neatly into a particular box. It looks and sounds like a white male power trip, but it feels much more introspective and melancholy and despairing. I find it to be a compelling story with some great acting and I think you should give it a look.

Have you ever felt so angry you want to explode? Have you ever had a week, or even a single day when nothing is going your way and everything seems to be going wrong? Who hasn't? On these days, you just want to throw your hands in the air and say I give up! Many people hold in their anger for days, weeks, months, or even years. They get up in the morning, go to work, come home, go to sleep, and do it all over again. There is no release of stress. People keep holding in this anger and tension, and it just builds, and builds, and keeps building, until it can build no more. This is the point where people lose it. This is the point where people commit suicide. This is the point where people go on shooting sprees. This is the point where people commit horrible crimes of passion, or just simply disappear and start a new life.Falling down is a movie about one such individual. The movie starts out with William Foster (Michael Douglas) sitting in a hot car in a traffic jam. You can feel the tension building up inside of him, until he finally gets out of the car and leaves it there. That moment when he gets out of his car is the moment he threw his hands in the air and said I give up! He wants to go home. We find out more and more about him as the movie progresses. We find out he has been fired from his job over a month ago, his wife left him and took their daughter, and he has pretty much lost it all. We don't know too much about him, which is a good thing, as this leaves room for us to fill in the blanks with our own imagination, and think whatever this guy has been through, it must not have been easy and this could be me. He goes through the city in a very matter-of-fact manner, trying to get home to his ex-wife, while people keep getting in his way. He has been taking people's crap all his life, and he is not going to take it anymore. William Foster is basically your average Joe. William Foster could represent anyone. You feel for this guy. You feel his frustration. You feel his anger. You see yourself in his character. You see how just one man who loses it causes a ripple effect and influences his environment.Throughout the movie, through all the things that happened, you ask yourself, did he really do anything wrong? He was quirky, he was brutally honest, he was aggressive. But was it justified? It actually makes sense! He really didn't do anything wrong. Afterall, he could have just went on a shooting spree and turned the gun on himself. The whole thing is a last ditch effort to get his life back together. When Duvall catches up with him, he realizes that this is in no way possible, so he essentially commits suicide by pulling a water pistol on Duvall and getting shot. Go see the movie. Then see it again, think about it, and absorb what you just saw. And most importantly, learn to shed yourself of stress, or you just might be the next William Foster!

The idea behind this, one that is not directly addressed in the film, is that Douglas is a sentimentalist at heart, and remembers a time and place in America where society was orderly and traditional.However, by 1993, the world has moved on and Douglas is living in the past. This is the underlying anger that motivates his irrational attacks on symbols of modern economics, elitist values, and racial/sexual insurgents.

First he finds himself in gridlock, which he deals with by abandoning his car. He then comes across an unhelpful convenience store clerk whose prices D-FENS 'argues, by demolishing the store with a baseball. He finds himself in gangland, and deals with gang members by attacking them and running them off. With their own weapons. When the gang retaliate, D-FENS takes their bag full of guns, and heads towards Venice for his young daughter's birthday party....Say what you want about the films subject matter, or it's rightly controversial characters, we all know a D-FENS, or at least someone who tries to put the world to rights.His cause may be just, but he's just another statistic who has been dealt a bad hand. He lost his job, his wife, and now everything seems desolate to him, where is life taking him? So is he right to be bitter, is he right to attack a shopkeeper because his prices are to high? Maybe not, but he sure has a right to defend himself when the shopkeeper goes to attack him.But then in turn, its possible that the shopkeeper has been attacked on several occasion, and by looks of where the store is situated, a person dressed like D-FENS wouldn't really be his typical patron, so this film could potentially hold a wealth of debatable material.The same could be said for the surplus owner, his outburst regarding sexual orientation could be just a shield for his own secrets. Maybe he's too scared to 'come out' because of his beliefs. After all, he reacts with what appears to be sexual frustration when D-FENS disagrees with him.And the film is covered with subliminal images. Almost every billboard sign and printed message coincides with the days events, or what is going to happen.It's also strikingly hilarious. The Whammyburger scene looks like its just been added to relieve the tension, and we've all wanted to smack a big mouthed driver at least once.Douglas is sensational as the desperate man who is fed up with society, and even though he thinks he's doing nothing wrong, it's just happening to him, but he's dealing with it all the wrong way.Support is brilliant, and it's probably Schumachers finest hour.

The car has been ditched and the journey is on foot. Perhaps the film's closest antecedent is The Swimmer in which a similarly deranged Burt Lancaster decides to 'swim' home through the pools of his neighbours.

I parodied many of these experiences in my 20 or so years spent there, and this was always one of my favorites.Michael Douglas' portrayal of D-FENS was,I believe, his greatest triumph.William Foster (Douglas) had been canned from his government defence job, and leaves his clapped out old car, with the license plate D-FENS, on the freeway and embarks on a walking crusade, on a very hot day, many miles to Venice Beach for his daughter's birthday celebration. He first encounters the Korean proprietor of a local convenience store, getting the better of him and relieving him of his baseball bat,used for (De-Fence). He then retires to a nearby park to repair a hole in his shoe, and is accosted by a pair of gang bangers. He uses the bat to see them off in good ol' Amarican boy fashion! He later encounters them again and manages to purloin from them a sports bag full of heavy armoury after they'd crashed the car they were using in the incompetent attempt to dispatch of him drive by style! Robert Duval performs equally well as the henpecked and put upon good guy cop on his last day with the LAPD.His wife has arranged for them to retire to Lake Havasu (London Bridge Havasu?)and he is only retiring early to please her. Meanwhile Foster has made his way to a Whammy Burger joint (very thinly disguised McDonald's) in order to seek some breakfast. He's informed by the very annoying manager that he's 2 minutes late and has to order from the lunch menu, but Foster has a bag full of firepower, so there's really no contest there! He has many more adventures, including giving a heart attack to an old golfing fart and eliminating a Nazi outdoors man store proprietor.Needless to say Duval turns out to be the hero of the day, after punching out an obnoxious colleague, and tracking D-FENS to Venice Pier. He also came out with one of the best lines of the movie, They lie to everyone, they lie to the fish! I have to get back to California, it's home to me now, and when I get off that plane I'll kneel and kiss the asphalt! I'll be home with all the other crazies.

Gradually, they shed their former selves, as when Foster gives him his breifcase saying 'I won't be needing it anymore.There are so many symbols sprinkled throughout, from the fact that both men have the same the toy in their possession that plays the same tune-'London bridges falling down', it is hard to pick just one. But here is one. One is the scene where Bill Foster is pleading with his exwife when he is the intended target of a retaliatory driveby. They miss and wind up crashing the car. He calmly walks over and then stops. There behind is an Hispanic style portrait of Jesus with his arms outstretched. He then blocks the view so that he has replaced Jesus. This imagery is repeated again at the very end when he gets shot and falls with his arms similar into the ocean. Another is him telling his ex over the phone how an Apollo mission had gone past the point of no return, and had to finish their journey to the end, what Foster must do.The cop, Pendergast, is on the same journey, gradually getting sucked into the of man on the loose. During the process, he loses his timidity and begins to reclaim what the once had. Both men, the end of their respective journeys, meet at the end in a showdown. A great scene. But one of the more subtle ones standout just as much. A man has been coming the same bank for seven years, the same as Foster's employment before his lay off, and is refused a loan. He protests with a sign saying 'not economically viable'. He is wearing the same outfit as Foster to a tee, and as he is led away by police in handcuffs, he catches Foster's eye, and Foster gives a slight nod.

Not only is it an excellent film, it's a really relevant one. It was true back in 1993, but I think it's even more true in today's world. It's the little things in the daily lives of people that can drive them crazy, as evidenced in this film. The film itself is a little clunky at times, but it has a hard-boiled script which created tough characters, but these characters work thanks to the tremendous acting.Schumacher's film is based off a simple premise and that is what would happen if someone went crazy over the daily stresses of life. This one man named William Foster only wanted to attend the birthday bash of his ex-wife's daughter. But of course he is dealt with being stuck in traffic on the hottest day of the year, so he begins a mental collapse with those standing in his way paying for it. Whether it's an over-priced soda or some gang members getting in his way, he is hell-bent on letting society know his intentions. Now it's up to a retiring cop, Prendergast to stop Foster's urban rampage.This film is incredibly acted. Michael Douglas gives one of his best performances as Foster. He does well in balancing the fine line between calmness and a quick temper to boot. While not his best performance, Robert Duvall does a good job as the elder cop on Foster's tail and is suffering with domestic issues.Overall, Falling Down can be seen as a satire at times, but its message is clear as day and it practically means that our society is crumbling apart. While this film is also seen as a crime drama, there is dark humor aplenty. There are some witty one-liners that Douglas would utter every so often. This film can also be seen as racist at times, but I don't believe Schumacher is playing to the stereotypes. Every urban area has their own nationality, so each race is fair game. This is a very good, action-packed film that effectively tackles an every day issue in our lives. I rate this film 9/10. "},{"Title":"London Bridge is falling down, falling down.

It is an absolute gem.In Falling Down, Michael Douglas (in possibly his finest performance) plays William Foster (or D-Fens), a slightly aggresive, but ultimately relatively ordinary guy who one day simply cracks. Foster decides he needs to visit his ex-wife and his daughter (it's his daughters birthday), and sets off on a route of rampage on the way, taking out anyone who stands in his way in this crazy world.As well as the fine performance by Douglas, Robert Duvall as a policeman on his final day is superb, as are the remainder of the cast. Ultimately though, without Douglas, this film would quite possibly fall flat. The way he manages to show a man who obviously has tinkered on the edge for some time, who finally snaps at the truely insane things in life (not being able to get a fastfood breakfast because they stopped 3 minutes ago for example) is stunning & for him to not even be nominated for an Oscar (was it going to be in the running for the 1993 or 1994 Oscars? Not sure) is a travesty.Whilst the acting is obviously worthy of mention, what we need to remember about films like this is that ultimately, even good acting is worthless without such an outstanding plot and script.Falling Down is clever in the way that, and I find it strange that out of the 10 or so reviews I've read on imdb, not one person has mentioned this, but the film is clever in the way that it regularly refers to London Bridge being located in America.In a world where capitalism, and an increasing obsession with the superficiality of life are taking over at an alarming rate, the title of this film reminds us of one of the biggest travesties of this capitalist history, this being the purchase of London Bridge. The title of this film Falling Down is taken from that age old nursery rhyme London Bridge is Falling Down, and for vast stages of the film, there are subtle, and not so subtle, links also made to the bridge. As well as Duvall's Prendergast, being forced by his domineering wife to move away, close to where the London Bridge now stands, there are the occasional clever lines which link Douglas to the Bridge and the Rhyme. The perfect example of these being when he is with the fascist and the fascist (Nick) tells him to spread his legs further. At this moment, Douglas replies with something along the lines of I can't move my arm because without it, I'll fall down. The writers of this film are clever clever men.Truth be told, I have but one complaint with this film. During his wave of distruction, Douglas arrives at the home of a Plastic Surgeon, and whilst there, he talks to a family who're having a BBQ. At this point, Douglas bursts into tears and seems almost like his mind has gone beyond that breaking point. At this moment though, the film switches across to Duvall and, when we return to Douglas (our anti-hero perhaps?) he is back on his feet and close to his ex-wife's home. What happened to him between these points? It appears almost as if the writers reached a blockage and didn't know where to go next, so they just skipped what could have been an amazing extra five minutes. A small shame, but ultimately it doesn't detract from this film too much.So to summarise. In Falling Down we are presented with a cleverly written piece of cinema with Michael Douglas putting on possibly the best performance of his career as he presents us with an ordinary man, who one day got so angry with the hideously flawed system in which we live, that he simply snapped. We all can associate with this man, this almost justice based psycho, who simply wants to be with his family & be happy. A modern masterpiece of cinema. Well worth a watch.

The innocent children... well versed in the operation of weapons of great destruction.

This is a world in which every element of society has completely lost touch with every other element. And the Michael Douglas character, feeling caught in the middle, lost in a world he no longer understands, snaps, grows bold, and swaggers through the twisted landscape, determined to make everything right again.He says he only wants to give his little girl a birthday present, but there is far more to it than that. Note that this gift he gives her is one of those little globe worlds, like a snow-shaker an ideal world he feels once existed and which he wants to be able to give to her.That world does not exist, of course, and perhaps even he knows it, but things are not as bad as his eyes see them. Chaos eventually resolves itself into order, and in the movie this happens through the Robert Duvall character from meekness and weakness he hardens into the figure of strength and righteous authority. Order is restored. The world is as it should be.We have never stopped relying on stereotypes, and this movie is very effective at puncturing them all, and leaving a little kernel of truth to observe and appreciate. Each of the little episodes that make up this movie always end in an assertion of simple humanity. The little masks that we wear, and that we see on others, are torn away and we see ourselves as we really are, no matter what image we might try and pass off for ourselves in the end, we are all fragile, vulnerable, often a little stupid but ultimately idealistic, and we are only good or bad by accident.Mixed with a sense of humour, a good cinematographic scheme, some decent secondary characters to support the powerhouse performance of Michael Douglas and the more subtle shadings in Robert Duvall's role, and the very real urban locations used, and you have one of the more notable achievements in film in the past decade or two. Enjoy.

Robert Duvall also does amazingly well in his role as a cop on his last day of the job, desperately trying to stop Bill Foster before he walks off the job.A lot of people make the mistake of thinking that because Joel Schumacher directed Batman and Robin that he's a terrible director. WRONG! It was just a mistake. He shows some great directing skills here. The cat and mouse feeling throughout between Douglas and Duvall is great. I also loved the music used in the movie.

This film really hit home for me and through Bill's confusion and psychotic thoughts and actions I can feel his sense of longing and yearning for the only tangible thing which he has ever had in his life...his wife and child.Pay close attention to this film as it is a lesson in so many things dealing with many simple subjects.

If we were less than tough and strong we would end up shooting and beating people up like Michael Douglas' character in this movie.  From the very start we realize it is something wrong with him, by the way he perceives the details, people's faces in the traffic jam, the heavy heat, or by the way he carries a conversation when he decides to leave the car in the middle of the road and go home on foot. There begins a journey with all the signs of a tragic end. Each new incident adds a little to his discomposure, and every time he refuses to ignore the absurdity of the situations, as a &#145;normal' person would do. But it's only a matter of time before he crosses the line and reaches the point of &#145;no return'. It is the point where someone loses their equilibrium, their sense of reason and stability and no one can help them. Society, in the form of local police reacts by trying to hunt him and stop him. Nothing left to do.  The big events in Bill's life that formed his character already happened. We only witness one day in his life, the fatal day that was bound to happen, when everything goes wrong.  The efficient filming and directing of the one-day story make possible the understanding of a lifetime. It seems to be one of the directors' strengths to choose a dense one-unit story (taking place one day like in `Falling Down' or in one particular spot like in `Phone Booth') and make something suspenseful and even meaningful out of it.

Like, for instance, he's stuck in traffic on perhaps the hottest day of the year. He's anxious to get home for his little girl's birthday. All around him were people shouting, kids acting obnoxious and road work equipment running. All of a sudden, Foster get's out of his car, license plate D-FENS, and claims he's going home.          En route, he stops in a convenience store and is enraged when he must pay .85¬¢ for a soda, so he trashes the store, pays for the soda and leaves. Next, he makes friends with an unfriendly gang. But unbeknownst to Foster, Detective Prendergast, who was retiring that day, became quite interested in this guy.           Continuing his rampage, Foster stops at the Whammyburger, and becomes very angry when learning they stopped serving breakfast, so he pulls out a gun from a gym bag full of firearms he took from a gang he met; Prendergast, reguardless of retiring, was still hot on Foster's tail. He had no idea who he was, but always got thedescription white shirt and tie. Not a good thing to wear in gangland; Foster stops in an army surplus store to buy new shoes. The storekeeper is a really, I mean really, disturbed man. He's prejudice and obsessed with war. The acquaintence between him and Foster doesn't end friendly.         Foster wanders into somebody's backyard and was angry to learn that the acres and mansion were owned by a plastic surgeon. After all, Foster used to work for a company that made missiles. He was practically defending the country. (Reason for D-FENS) and is upset that all he got out of it was unemployment. He makes it home for his daughter Adele's birthday, but wife Beth knew Foster was a dangerous man and tried to stay away from him. Soon, Prendergast arrives for a showdown at the pier. He takes out Foster.        So our story comes to a happy ending. I think at some points, we can all understand what Foster is going through. I'm sure we've all been down that road. Does Foster kill anybody? Just people who deserved it; Michael Douglas was very good in this movie. It's the first Michael Douglas movie I've ever seen, next to The American President, I guess this is the first Douglas movie I've liked. Robert Duvall is good also.

How cool is this cool guided film, led by a stellar performance by Douglas, in still one of his best roles. Falling Down just doesn't touch on the frailty of a man, whose finally had enough and cracked, but other things like ethics, economy, and anti gay themes (the great Frederic Forrest, in his homo phobic gun trigger role) to name a few, are wonderfully exemplified. But also the movie also it has a realness in it's characters, who Douglas encounters, en route to his destination, that being of his split wife, and daughter, on her third birthday. Not all the people Douglas encounters, are pleasant, but they're all real people, not fictional in the sense of being unreal, and aren't over the top, although the young sickly smiling waitress, really adds to the term, happy meal. We've all been there; we're finally had enough, and want to kill, the only difference, Douglas takes it beyond that, that ends in such a a tragic and sad climax, similar to that of Thelma and Louise, cause these are all heroes. From the first reel, in wonderfully captured close ups, we feel what Douglas feels, and can't wait to go and this journey. Bill Forster (an ordinary and kind of creepy looking Douglas, with short prickly hair) vacates his car in hectic mid morning traffic, causing quite a traffic bottleneck. It's so interesting, how the story and situations, realistically follow, and anytime Douglas is on the screen, he's engaging. Now slowly connecting the dots, veteran cop Duvall (in one of his best roles) on his day of retirement, works this last, out of the ordinary domestic-call it what you will, to track this crazy down, alongside his younger partner, Ticotin, really showing female power. Personally, some of Douglas's victims, are righteous kills, where there was quite some egging on moments, for me. F.D. really plays out realistically, something more than a movie, with potent and admirable statements, insightful too, for it's realities and views, not just by Douglas. The arrogant, uncaring, road worker, made me sick. A fattened up Tuesday Weld is fantastic as Duvall's unstable wife, where that punch out was gratefully warranted. Falling Down is something of a jewel of movie, but it's a electrifying movie experience, representing with moral and social issues, you should experience, just once.

Or longed to vent their spleen at greedy shopkeepers who overcharge for basic goods? Or imagined launching an RPG into some seemingly pointless roadworks?Recently canned defence worker Bill Foster, (Michael Douglas), a powder keg of anger and frustration whose very short fuse has just run out, doesn't just fantasise about such things abandoning his car in a jam on the freeway, he sets off on foot to visit his young daughter at Venice Beach, leaving a trail of escalating violence and destruction in his wake, using extreme force to deal with every obstacle.Foster's rampage through gangland LA eventually comes to the attention of soon-to-be-retired cop Prendergast (Robert Duvall), who tries to apprehend the armed and dangerous D-Fens (as he is also known) before he can reach the home of his frightened ex-wife Beth (Barbara Hershey).Director Joel Schumacher has more than his fair share of detractors (most of whom cite the admittedly god-awful Batman and Robin to support their argument), but Falling Down is just one of several films that go to prove that the guy is no talentless hack (The Lost Boys and 8mm are also amongst my favourites of his).From the excellent opening crane shot which crawls from a close up of Douglas's face, out of his car, over the queue of traffic, and back into the vehicle, Schumacher's direction is simply superb visually stunning, the city of LA&#x97;captured in the sweltering heat of mid summer&#x97;is as much a character as any of the humans, its contrast of urban decay and opulent wealth used to highlight the injustices of life; expertly paced, Foster's gradual journey from angry average Joe to psychotic loony is utterly convincing.Of course, Schumacher owes much of his film's success to star Douglas, who puts in a wonderfully nuanced performance, keeping his progressively violent character sympathetic to the end Foster is not a monster, but a sad product of a society that keeps piling on the pressure until breaking point. It's thought provoking stuff, now more than ever in these days of mass shootings and acts of random violence.

Apart from the lead character's decent into madness, there is racism, homophobia, the decay of modern society, and cynical observations on life, poverty, commercialism and the economy.Many audiences know Michael Douglas for his roles in Wall Street (for which he won the Academy Award for Best Actor), Basic Instinct, Fatal Attraction, and Traffic. Without a doubt, this is certainly one of his best roles to date. Michael Douglas plays William Foster, also known as D-FENS. The movie opens with William Foster stuck in the middle of a traffic jam. After his frustration boils over when the air conditioning fails to work in his car, he abandons his car in the middle of traffic. Foster's only reply, I'm going home. From there he starts his journey across Los Angeles to see his estranged daughter for her birthday. We later learn that Foster is divorced from his wife (Barbara Hershey) and she has filed a restraining order again him. He has also recently lost his job.Along the many encounters on his way home, he clashes with a belligerent store owner, gang members who accost him, construction workers, homeless people, fast food workers, various rude people who behave with a sense of self-entitlement, and a bigoted Neo-Nazi. Foster just explodes after his buttons are pushed one too many times and lashes out at everyone, leaving behind him a path of destruction. Foster also accumulates along the way an arsenal of weapons which he uses to deal with the many problems he comes across. We also learn that he has had problems with his temper and unstable behaviour in the past, hence why his wife does not want anything to do with him.Robert Duvall brilliantly plays Sergeant Prendergast, a mild mannered police detective stuck behind the desk who also happens to be retiring from the Los Angeles Police Department at the end of the day. In a way, he is the opposite of Foster, but he too has is problems of his own. He is henpecked by his unstable and neurotic wife who wants him to retire from the LAPD early to move away from Los Angeles, his only daughter died many years ago from unknown causes, other police officers such as the arrogant and obnoxious Detective Lydecker (D.W. Moffett) treat him with contempt including his own commanding officer Captain Yardley (Raymond J. Barry) who openly admits he never liked him and the only person that sticks by Prendergast is friend and ally Detective Torres (Rachel Ticotin). Although it is his last day before retirement, Sergeant Prendergast is determined to find Foster before he causes more harm to others and before he reaches his ex-wife and child. Towards the end Prendergast eventually stands up for himself, shutting everyone up, and while he shows everyone that he is a good cop and decent person at heart he does so without lashing out violently unlike Foster.While audiences can empathise with many of the problems Foster encounters, the movie certainly does not glorify or condone vigilantism, breaking the law, violent behaviour, and bigotry, contrary to what some people believe. Michael Douglas' character William Foster is certainly not a hero in this movie, instead he is the villain and the victim, and shows the audience that he is a sad and broken individual that is past the point of no return.Joel Schumacher has had a mixed career as a director (he almost killed the Batman franchise with the 1997 flop Batman and Robin), but without question Falling Down is his best movie to date. Falling Down is very underrated and while certainly not for everyone, it deeply explores the many social themes shown in the movie and provides us with many thoughts.10/10 "},{"Title":"A man who confronts all the problems he sees with society on his way home.","Date":"3 January 2015","Score":"2 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Crime, Drama, Thriller","Review":" William Foster (Michael Douglas) is having a bad day.

He storms across Los Angeles violently lashing out against all the injustices that get in his way. Meanwhile we see Sergeant Martin Prendergast (Robert Duvall) a police officer on his last day of work dealing with similar injustices at the police station as he attempts to track Foster down. As you watch this movie you realize that even though Foster is a complete nut, you can sympathize with lots of the problems he encounters. I mean who hasn't gotten a burger that looks nothing at all like the one of the menu. Prendergast is also annoyed at his surrounding but he seems to have kept himself together. Douglas and Duvall play Foster and Prendergast perfectly, and the writing is equally enjoyable. It's a perfect depiction of the many problems with society of the modern age. I highly recommend it.

While I believe this happens all too rarely, Tigerland being his last phenomenal venture, his good films are really good.And Falling Down achieves near-perfection in its dive into the urban nightmare that was (and perhaps still is) America, specifically L.A. It's about a man who, in a scene that harks back to the opening scene of Fellini's 8 1/2, exits the fiery hell of his automobile, grabs his briefcase and enters the streets. But this is not another story of a yuppie being destroyed by a world he doesn't understand.D-Fens, or Bill Forster knows the urban nightmare. He lives it. And when he goes to a showdown with it, he's horrifyingly well-prepared. Through his eyes and his encounters we witness the contradictions, hypocrisies and lies of the world through which he wades. His odyssey is aggressive, but also full of despair - the growing knowledge that he is not going to achieve anything though it, he will simply fall down. But the fall reveals, like most plights into madness, the truths imperceptible to those who operate like good little boys and girls obeying the rules put down for them. After all, Falling Down, is a about the death of the American dream, a subject all too often explored, but rarely with such grace, humor, and insight.It also has one hell of a performance by Michael Douglas. He captures the middle-class, white-collar fragility and eventual collapse flawlessly. D-Fens has many shades to him; he's part insane, part over-educated, part under-skilled, but he is also lost and in pain. When he challenges the system he's letting off steam and sprouting words of bitter truth, but eventually he surfs into the darkness of his own psyche and reveals a lost and vulnerable man. This is crucial to Falling Down, because it is not simply a vigilante story. It's a story of a man who simply cracks under pressure and Michael Douglas does a phenomenal job of portraying him.It also has one hell of a performance by Robert Duvall. I remember Duvall as the half-insane surfing-obsessed captain in Apocalypse Now, but this is exactly the opposite. Duvall plays a detective who serves as a perfect counterpoint to D-Fens. He sees what D-Fens sees, but instead is quieted by it. He possesses a certain wisdom acquired through age and tragedy. Duvall is frail on the outside, but has surprising strength on the inside - Douglas' character is precisely the opposite. The difference between the two characters is what makes the climax so anti-climactic, yet concurrently so satisfying. It's a showdown of quiet understanding and damning inevitability.But it is also of hope, in some strange way. Because Duvall's detective understands D-Fens profoundly - and vicariously so do we. He represents the sign of hope amidst the world we have just witnessed, because he doesn't quit. Falling Down, thus, is about a deadly descent and little falls from which we can recover. It doesn't seek to manipulate, but to reveal. It's dark as hell, but so is it's topic - there ought to be more films like it.

Because this is a retelling of the tale of Ulysses (Homer) who is homeward bound (a perilous journey after the wars) to resume life with his beloved Penelope.For those who have heard that this is a violent and racist film --- forget that.  D-Fens comes into several threatening circumstances as he wends his way home and he reacts to protect himself, acting with violence when he is threatened with violence. I admit one must consider what seems violent to him.  The toughs with the baseball bat or machine guns are clear enough examples.  The McDonalds and Korean shopkeeper scenes require empathy --- the violence here is that nothing is as it should be (to him). Remember the Bazooka?  The pawn shop episode shows D-Fens expressing moral outrage.  Nothing about this film suggests Violence Exploitation to me.  It is all organic to the story. I think this film is an example of everything clicking together resulting in brilliance.Uh, I liked it. A lot.

His increasingly irrational behaviour is the response of a man whose personal life has unravelled at the same time as he believes that changes in society have transformed L.A. into an urban hell.Foster is first seen caught in a traffic jam on a sweltering hot day. His frustration grows to a point where he can't tolerate it any more and so decides to abandon his car and walk on to his ex-wife's house because it's his daughter's birthday and he wants to attend her party.On his journey across the city, Foster first gets into an argument with a Korean shopkeeper about the high prices that he charges and then terrorises the man by brandishing a baseball bat and trashing a large number of the products that are on display in the shop.He then has a confrontation with a couple of Hispanic gang members who threaten him with a butterfly knife for having inadvertently wandered onto their territory. He retaliates using his baseball bat and pockets the knife after the two men run away. The two gang members later seek revenge when, with others, they try to kill Foster in a drive-by shooting that goes wrong. After some people are shot and the gang's car crashes, most of the gang are killed. Foster then goes over to a badly injured survivor and using one of the gang's own guns, sadistically shoots him in the leg. He then picks up a bag full of weapons that he finds in the gang's car and continues on his journey.A whole series of incidents follow which either frustrate or anger Foster and he responds by actions such as terrorising the staff and customers of a fast food restaurant and killing a homophobic Neo-Nazi store owner from whom he steals a bazooka which he later fires in the direction of a group of men working on a construction site.The L.A.P.D. receive information about the various incidents and assume them to be unrelated until a desk-bound officer, Sergeant Martin Prendergast (Robert Duvall) recognises they probably all involve the same man. Prendergast and his partner Detective Sandra Torres (Rachel Ticotin) deduce that Foster is probably heading towards his ex-wife's home and so rush to the house in Venice, California where Beth (Barbara Hershey) lives with their daughter and the events that follow soon lead to a confrontation between the two men.Falling Down is a disturbing story which raises some interesting issues about the degrading treatment that ordinary people can suffer when they're made unemployed and divorced and they also live in an environment in which no-one treats anyone else with any respect. It's also understandable how an ordinary person can become brutalised by such an experience and how they could even descend into the type of madness that Foster goes through.It's also clear, however, that he had a pre-existing propensity for violence which Beth recognised and led her to taking out a restraining order against him. Although he'd never actually beaten her, she'd become terrified of him because she knew it would only take the right trigger to provoke him into extreme violence.Foster's appearance is not typical of a man of the nineties and suggests that his values are anchored in an earlier period of time. It is also, of course, a symptom of the fact that he's slow to recognise change and reluctant to come to terms with it.Prendergast is a man, who for different reasons, also experienced difficulties with his wife, the loss of his daughter, the imminent loss of his job and a lack of respect from those around him. His more reasoned and philosophical response to the situation is also seen as providing him with a more successful way of navigating his way out of the predicament than the course of action taken by Foster.Solid performances by Duvall and Hershey contribute greatly to the success of this film and Michael Douglas is exceptional as he expresses his character's anger, sadness and confusion with incredible power and poignancy.

After losing his job, as he tries to go home for the birthday of his daughter, he gets stuck in the traffic and heat of L.A. . He gets out of the car and starts walking, but soon faces several people who try to hinder him - jerks, criminals, fanatics. Foster snaps and begins his descent into madness and violence. Cop Prendergast (Robert Duvall), on his last day before retirement, pursues him.Schumacher made some terrible films in his careers (I am looking at you, Batman & Robin), but this one redeems him to an extent. It's surprising on how many levels Falling Down works black comedy, social commentary, drama, character study... besides, this has to be one of the most crowd-pleasing movies of all times. Fact is, in most over-stressed inhabitants of great cities there is something of William Foster. And even if D-Fens is nuts, at first he is even somewhat sympathetic.Douglas delivers here the best performance of his career. As Foster he is creepy, funny and pathetic all at the same time. Duvall gives a nicely understated turn as quietly competent Prendergast.Supporting players are wonderful too, and perfectly cast. From smug Rick to the annoying panhandler, from the unfriendly shopkeeper to the bitter construction worker, they really look and act like people you could meet in those situations in real life.And Falling Down is, among all other things, very funny. The script has an hilariously wicked quality to it. Several scenes crack me up every time, like the confrontation with the hobo who claims to be a Vietnam veteran (What were you? a drummer boy?) and the golf players (Bad news.

This is an incredible movie whereby it spins an allegory about one man's descent into hell and the society which represents this hell. There are no winners in this plot and I see occurrences similar to what I experienced in Los Angeles during 2006. I feel this could happen to any person regardless of race or gender. In this case, he was a white middle aged man with many issues. The movie seemed realistic is some instances but drifted away to Hollywood fantasy (the bazooka scene later in the movie). Do we see similar cases like this today? This could definitely happen in any community in the United States for any of the reasons defined in the movie. One should watch this and then understand many of the frustrations which many people don't assume affect different sectors of society. Because one dresses in a shirt and tie does not mean that a calm demeanor lies beneath the surface such as what the allegory of this movie is stating. I consider this one the best of '93 and well worth buying or watching. I will be watching this again in Lubbock, Texas and with my cousin and friend in Los Angeles.

Some are politically correct; some are not.

"},{"Title":"Loss of sanity caused by a man who lost his way","Date":"1 March 2016","Score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Crime, Drama, Thriller","Review":" Michael Douglass has already become unstable in the first scene he's in when he's sitting in his car, hands firmly on the wheel and looking very frustrated. His first moments of really snapping come in the first ten minutes of the film when he first, jumps out of his car in the middle of traffic jammed LA highway. Then, he goes off the rails in a Korean owned convenience store when the Korean first, refuses to break Douglas's dollar without purchase, and then, overcharges him for a 12 oz can of coke. Well, at least Douglas thinks he's being overcharged because he's totally obsessed with comparing corner store prices to what they were in the sixties. Douglas starts asking prices for individual random merchandise, and then smashes or breaks each item with a baseball bat when the Korean guy names the price, because Douglas finds each item much more expensive than it would've been in 1965. He has no ability to except inflation, how everything in America has been getting more expensive over the years. But Douglas's anger is more about him believing that the Korean store owner has raised prices to rob the American public including himself.Similar style situations carry on throughout the movie. Douglas feeling that he's being robbed or taken advantage of, and then handling it with the most extreme anger and even violence. We also learn that Douglas has lost his job and that his wife has put up a restraining order on him. This tells us that Douglas has already done some things in the past he shouldn't have done before the day where he hopped out of his car and started a walking wave of destruction. Douglad feels like his actions are necessary because they're for a just cause. In some situations though, it seems more like he's just defending himself such as when two Latino gang members are mugging him with a knife to his throat. He whacks them with a baseball bat only when it looks like it was in self defense because the only other option at that moment would've been to hand over his belongings. Later on, Douglas shoots and kills a Nazi surplus store owner, but only after he assaulted Douglas and had him pinned to the ground with a gun to his head. A lot of people here will argue if Douglas really did anything wrong in either of those circumstances because they both clearly seemed to be moves made in self defense. Other things Douglas did, however, were very clearly things that were definitely wrong and crazy moves of Douglas snapping such as when he pulled out a gun at a fast food restaurant because they stopped serving breakfast. Same with when Douglas shot a bazooka at a construction site just because they closed the road. Same with shooting a phone booth with a machine gun just because of some impatient jerk waiting to use the phone. Same with the Korean shop. They were all things that no sane, held together person would've done. So did Douglas break some laws that day? Absolutely. Big time. Were there better, more reasonable moves a man could've made who's tired of the pressures and injustices of modern society? Whos been made to feel obsolete or economically unviable? Absolutely.The police team on Douglas's case is led by Detective Prentagas (Robert Duvaul). He is on his last day on the force before retiring. Duvaul himself has felt some of the same pressures of society and also feels obsolete. But unlike Douglas, Duvaul has held it together and stayed on the right side of the law. Duvaul's captain has told him that he's worthless, so he handles it by showing a higher exceptional performance on the job. That's a better way of handling things than stealing baseball bats and guns and destructing or shooting at things. Duvaul shows his boss that he's gonna catch the Douglas character for all he's done, and he won't go home until he's done it, no matter how many times his wife bugs him to come home. His wife has been after him to retire, and that's the only reason he's doing it. His wife also is the one who made him get off the street and take the desk jocky job. His co workers and boss in return all think Duvaul is a coward. Catching Douglas is what Duvaul will do to prove them wrong. Duvaul will also choose not to retire yet and show that his wife is not the one who wears the pants in the family. See how both Douglas and Duvaul handle the pressures and injustices of society. One in a sane and legal way, and one not so.

The movie pretends to be a revenge fantasy but just look closer and you'll see that it's just aggravating manipulation.The opening scene features Michael Douglas sitting in his car on a sweltering day, having lost his job, stuck in a traffic jam and being accosted by a pesky fly. His eyes, his sweaty brow and his twisted furious lip give us the visage of a man about to burst. He is and for the rest of the movie that's what he does.Stomping home with a briefcase in one hand and a bat in the other he runs into a Korean grocer who won't give him change for a dollar (and has trouble pronouncing eighty-five cents) leading Douglas to trash the place with the bat. He crosses a golf course and raises that ire of a snobbish golfer with a stupid hat leading him to give the guy a heart attack. He runs into a couple of street kids who want his briefcase. He runs into an annoying neo-Nazi. He runs afoul of a smiling fast food worker who won't serve him breakfast because it's 5 minutes into the lunch rush, Douglas retaliates by firing a submachine into the ceiling.My problem is that the movie doesn't play fair because everyone that Douglas runs into is rude, unbending and/or obnoxious so we never feel that any of them are the least bit reasonable. Nor do we feel anything for Douglas who is never seen as anything but a raging Buford Pusser, a hothead with bad luck who always seems to be in the wrong place at the wrong time. This is a road-rage movie and not a healthy one.I know that many people have argued that the movie is just satire but I think that it chooses easy targets.

There is quite a bit of pathos mixed in with everything, esp. when the leads both realize that the tipping point has been reached, and left behind quite far. Duvall provides and efficient foil to Douglas' angst and fury, being the guy who's seen-it-all and doesn't like it one bit, but between the two, this guy's put a lid on it, and the lid's quite strongly in place. Regret the fact that I was never able to watch this on the big screen, which the lead's fall-from-grace would have been mind-blowingly spectacular, but the small screen had to do, in those good old days when R rated flicks had their place in regular local programming. Still a wonder why this has not been given its rightful due, both by critics as well as audiences, since it is quite mainstream to please the masses and has uncompromising elements that, one would think, the critics enjoyed writing about.

The title Falling Down refers to the old London Bridge that has been relocated to Arizona, and a retiring detective's wife want to move there rather than stick it out in Los Angeles. The day that he is set to retire LAPD Detective Prendergast (Robert Duvall of Joe Kidd) finds himself up to his ears into a series of homicides involving an enigmatic character, William Foster (Michael Douglas of Last Vegas), who is an unemployed defense scientists. During his heyday, Foster designed missiles to protect America. Since he has lost his job and divorced his wife Beth (Barbara Hershey of Beaches), Bill has been living with his mother. Of course, he hasn't told his mom a thing about losing his job. He keeps up appearances by packing his lunch in an attach√© case and heading off to work. When Falling Down unfolds, our protagonist finds himself caught up in gridlocked traffic. He blows his cool at this point when it becomes too much to handle. The air conditioner in his automobile doesn't work and Foster is about to burn up. He abandons his automobile to trudge off from the freeway to a convenience store where he tries to buy a Coca-Cola from the Korean proprietor, Mr. Lee (Michael Paul Chan of The Goonies), who wants to charge him 85 cents for the beverage. Foster has been trying to reach his ex-wife by telephone because he is coming home to help his daughter, Adele (Joey Hope Singer) celebrate her birthday. Between the time that he smashes up Mr. Lee's store until he shoots it out with Prendergast on the pier at Venice Beach, he collides with trigger-happy Hispanic thugs, an Aryan (Frederick Forrest) who runs an Army & Navy surplus store, and several other villains. Los Angeles is presented as a zoo with all sorts of objectionable people. Sometimes, depending on much of a racist you are, you may find Foster's antics rewarding. The conflict in the fast-food restaurant when Foster cannot order breakfast because only lunch is being served is hilarious. Foster's tutorial that he receives from a young African-American kid on a bicycle is fantastic, too! His encounter with the Hispanic ruffians who try to extort money from him is good. Eventually, this idiots load up in a car and come after him with an arsenal of firearms, but when they try to cut him down in a drive-by shooting, they miss him entirely, crash their car, and guess who finds them? Foster strolls up, relieves them of their armory, and shoots of the survivors in the leg. As tragic as Falling Down is, you may still find it entertaining. Initially, we feel sympathetic toward Foster until he eventually crosses the line and harms harmlessly individuals. Even then some of these people bring problems on themselves. The scene at the golf course is pretty funny, but Foster winds up killing an egotistical golfer who needs his medication. Meanwhile, our detective hero tangles with his wife on the telephone until he gets fed up with her. The performances are all memorable as is this controversial film with commentary galore. You won't forget Falling Down.

The cop and D-Fens are totally opposite characters. the cop is like the most of us. a pacifist. D-Fens is a extremist! Will they change. well you have to watch the movie to find out!! it.. All the characters fit the role perfectly. Like they say in the movie Everyone has their own idea of paradise A must watch.

It can be even tougher if you're a corporate drone who can't afford a soda, a phone call or even sleeves. And when your AC is broke and Garfield smiles at you, you can't find any comfort in how similar your life at that moment might be to the R.E.M. video for Everybody Hurts. Michael Douglass is one worker ant that isn't going to take road construction and grumpy golfers sitting down. He simply has to escape the stench of mediocrity that is the proverbial traffic jam and go on a quest for a less aggravating life. Why he can't find that in the middle of Los Angeles is anyone's guess. But Falling Down isn't simply a film about the angry white man or about your rights as a consumer. For the most part, Falling Down is a cautionary tale for stubborn fast food chains who refuse to serve breakfast after 11am. It's also a warning to sweaty convenience store owners who charge too much for soda, gun store nuts with dreams of domination and loco gangsteritos who don't tolerate loitering in the hood. Meanwhile, Rob Duvall is having a great day. He's in the same traffic jam but he's admiring the vandalism on a giant woman's breasts. That is, he's admiring the vandalism on a giant woman's breast on a billboard. This is a man who appears to love the smell of car exhaust in the morning.

Falling Down tells the terrifying story a white-collar man who has been fired and is now getting revenge on his city on the hottest day of the summer. This is not your traditional revenge film. It's much darker, seamier, and more uncomfortable than any drama in recent years.Michael Douglas plays Bill Foster, a man who once had it all. A steady job, a great wife, and a kid. Through a series of unfortunate circumstances, Bill has lost almost everything. On the hottest day of the year in Los Angeles, he loses his patience. I'm going home he claims as he leaves his car on the freeway after a taunting, very realistic sequence at the beginning of the film. The remainder of the film shows him returning home to his wife, who doesn't want to see him ever again, so he can give his kid a birthday present.On his way home, Bill runs into all sorts of crazy, patient-testing circumstances. For example, being a few minutes after the breakfast curfew at a fast food restaurant or wandering into the wrong side of town. The outcome of each is completely unexpected and very different from what reason might tell us. The great thing about these sequences is they're genuine and discard any form of clich√©s we've come across in other action films.Falling Down's excellent filmmaking reminded me of a very underrated thriller I enjoyed about a year ago. It was called The Trigger Effect and was overlooked by pretty much everyone. The direction both films took was impeccable, and each created such an amazing atmosphere for their respected issue. In Falling Down, we get a great look at the seamy side of the city. Some points we feel hot-headed like the character or just plain hot from the heat that seems to be drifting from the screen into the audience. The atmosphere is exquisite, and going back to the opening scene, it depicts a plethora of things that we hear on the streets, only magnified. What makes Michael Douglas's character snap is because he is hearing horns honking, smells the exhaust from cars, feels the heat, feels a fly on the back of his neck and hears it buzzing, etc. All of these things are quibbles we have about every day life, but it's the little things that final push the character off the small edge he's standing on.In The Trigger Effect, the characters are going through a power outage. The seamy qualities of the town like looting, robbery, and low patience seem to also spill out onto the audience. That was a great thriller not only for its plot and dialog, but its believable scenarios complimented by its perfect atmosphere.I think one of the most overlooked aspects on Falling Down is its social commentary on the world we inhabit now. Arrogance in society has now etched itself in being the norm, and we look at snobby attitudes as the typical lifestyle today. It's unbelievable. What was considered low class back in the fifties, is now considered normal in the 2000's. Never did we think something like swearing, gangs, fights, guns, robbery, and just plain ignorance would be the normal lifestyle. Guess what? It is. And it has been on the rise for years.The film also silently sneaks in political undertones. In an effort to show centrist political opinions, the character of Bill Foster is portrayed as a person favoring both political parties. Scenes establish he doesn't believe in welfare and others establish that he is for anti-immigrations laws. Falling Down doesn't bleed politics, but doesn't hesitate to sneak them in. I believe it furthers the creation of the character as a person. We can learn more about him even in the grittiest circumstances.Falling Down not only gave me a great movie experience, but it showed me the un-sugarcoated life of the world. Rarely do we get such brutal honesty in the world today. The film shows us that the truth must come with less sugar and more facts. Schumacher has successfully concocted another true-to-life thriller.NOTE I neglected to mention the subplot involving Robert Duvall playing a cop trying to stop Foster's crimes. I felt that it wasn't wholly necessary, and we needed less of that and more identifiable urgency in the film.Starring Michael Douglas and Robert Duvall. Directed by Joel Schumacher.

I didn't want to perceive the character of William Foster aka D-Fens as a bad guy either, because this contradicted the whole rooting process the film's thought-provoking script was encouraging, so, who is he, if not the bad guy? Admittedly, D-fens incarnates the demographic category called the 'Silent Majority', the average worker, overeducated and under-skilled educated enough to 'play the game' and live with a secure job and a happy family but not skilled enough to be more than a decent family-man. Suitably, he's Caucasian, thirty-something, with a white shirt and black tie, a prototypical look with enough anonymousness to crystallize all the animosity of a society begging for convenient targets not menacing, not carrying any weapons and not belonging to a minority, not rich enough to build a wealth on productive forces other than his, and not poor enough to live as a parasite. His life is a bunch of 'not' that classifies him in the most vulnerable social category.D-Fens' social condition immediately reminds of Travis Bickle from Taxi Driver with that three-dimensionality enriched by a psychological ticking bomb D-Fens as the quintessential implosive angry man who accumulates pressure before finally Falling Down reaching his breaking-point. His journey into the depth of L.A. urbanism is the nightmarish experience that will turn him into a dangerous sociopath. Still, D-Fens is no Vietnam vet, he's more civilized than Bickle and it's precisely his educated behavior and negotiating manners that fan the flames of his recurrent encounters until it culminates with the 'bad guy' realization, when he laconically understands he was already 'bad' by society's standards. And Douglas' attitude is crucial as it reveals an acceptance of fate, deprived from the excitement that could have asked for a distasteful celebration.Now, 'how can society make an everyday man bad?' is the interesting question the film raises, making relevant points through a clever editing. It opens with a suffocating traffic jam during a hot-summer day. Stuck between shouting husbands, ugly old broad putting her lipstick, noisy kids and an irritating fly, D-Fens, in an existentialist impulse, leaves the car and go &#x85; somewhere, a tribute to the opening of Fellini's 8¬Ω leaving us with the same level of uncertainty. But I don't think a specific destination was necessary considering the episodic architecture of the plot that features many aspects of the American society's decline, starting with a banal Korean convenience store.The film is a powerful assemblage of many vignettes denouncing the degeneracy of a society so dedicated to the notion of profit, that human interactions had been reduced to slogans, prices, communication, and ownership. And the core of D-Fens constant misadventures relies on his incapability to assimilate this new language, whereas it's a sandwich picture, a vulgar graffiti, the hostility of a homeless bum or a rich golfer... The irony is that the film indirectly reflects the same issues it denounces as any viewer would feel the deepest contempt toward Frederic Forrest as the hateful Neo-Nazi surplus store owner, while we're less reluctant to find excuses for the Latino gang that attempted to kill him, as if we were already manipulated by an unconscious Manichaeism.But to accuse Falling Down of racism is a superficial mistake, because the film sympathizes with the white man as zealously as Spike Lee with Black people, but it never loses its objectivity. There's a powerful scene showing a black man protesting in the street because his bank refused a loan as he was not 'economically viable'. This man, dressed like D-Fens, was mirroring his condition as an outcast. Indeed, a society where the biggest residences are inhabited by plastic surgeons says a lot about the level of superficiality governing it and when banks consider people as economical objects, it's only fitting that people treat themselves the same way, with their appearance as the number one asset. So, why does the film make a bad guy out of a sympathetic character? Maybe it subtly helps to show how being a man is a supplementary handicap in a society where the mother has all the rights. Barbara Hershey plays Beth, the ex-wife, who refuses to let her husband see their daughter on her birthday while nothing ever seems to point out how violent and bad D-Fens was, we can only speculate that his anger management problem was more serious than Beth's apparent paranoia. Or another answer is illustrated by the Prendergast character, Robert Duvall as the cop prematurely quitting his job, an attitude that appeased his anxious wife (Tuesday Weld), but inspired the disrespect of his colleagues. Falling Down punctuates D-Fens' story with Prendergast investigation and we're led to believe that D-Fens 'falling down' will coincide with Prendergast 'rising up'.But the Prendergast subplot, despite Duvall's impeccable performance, betrays Joel Schumacher's direction, which uses an intelligent script with an obviousness that doesn't trust enough our intelligence. Portraying D-Fens as a man capable to hurt his daughter undermined his status a victim, with society responsible of his guilt. The movie describes a psychological 'falling down', which physically is an accelerating linear movement before a final impact. The impact was the direction D-Fens' journey needed, not a potential killing. The film sinned a lot by 'over-directing', like having the kid say he learned how to use a bazooka from TV, or Prendergast being constantly teased by his colleagues when we know he's getting closer to D-Fens while we never expect what will come to D-Fens, we're always ahead of Prendergast.And the popularity of the D-Fens' clips on Youtube proves that what people most remember is how relevant the film describes 90's American society without the flashiness of 'Fight Club' or the poetry of 'American Beauty', it's a dark depiction of a 90's post-modern slice of life without concession and with more humor than many comedies and despite some flaws, one of the most important films of the 90's.

But thankfully most of us don't strike back violently like Michael Douglas in Falling Down. Douglas plays an unemployed defense contractor who finds himself out of a job in the early 1990s now that the Cold War is over. He is also estranged from his family, and thought to be a danger to them. One morning, while stuck in a traffic jam, he cannot take any more. He gets out of his car and starts walking across L.A., claiming he is simply going home. Basically this means to his daughter's birthday party where even if he made it there, he would not be welcome anyway. He reacts violently to anyone who confronts or hassles him on the way home. And on the streets of L.A., there is trouble around every corner. Douglas leaves plenty of victims in his wake. Depending on your own life's experiences, you may or may not agree with his actions.It is easy to compare this movie to Death Wish, or some other vigilante film, but this is far more complex for better or sometimes worse. The big problem with the film is its meandering perspective. The scenes where Douglas confronts stereotypical big city types are often constructed in a manner that we the audience are supposed to see it his way. We are supposed to recognize their behavior or attitudes that set him off, and more or less accept his reaction. All the while we are meant to believe he is crazy. So, in effect, if we've ever thought about taking out our frustrations on rude or dangerous people, then we may in fact be crazy too. Douglas is clearly a loon, but so are these stereotypical store clerks, construction workers, gang members, old buzzards on a golf course, homeless urchins, etc. How can we not take some satisfaction as Douglas stabs a Neo-Nazi? Or blows up a needless construction site that is wasting tax payer money? Does that make us crazy, too? Or does it only if we actually commit the violence? The film has some annoying female characters playing Douglas's estranged wife and Robert Duvall's overbearing wife. In fact, just about every character is this film is somewhat annoying. Maybe this is done to add to the frustration Douglas feels. Duvall plays an aging cop working his last day before retirement. His aggravating wife keeps demanding he comes home before he gets hurt on his last day. That whole angle is a bit stereotypical. Did it have to be his LAST day? How about a couple months before retirement? Joel Schumacher has done much worse, but Falling Down is not great. How you respond to it will depend on your own perspectives. Can you believe this is almost 20 years old? Is L.A. better or worse since then? How has your town or city changed? Are you economically viable? A greater number of Americans likely find themselves not so viable in these days of Hope and Change. 7 of 10 stars.The Hound.

To be honest, it's a bit awkward that a director like Joel Schumacher could have directed this, but don't let what happened to Batman cause any skepticism. This is a film that we can all relate to in some extent.Michael Douglas' character as William D-Fens Foster depicts this antihero at a stage in his life that he is completely fed up with everything, and all he wants to do is to see his daughter for her birthday, despite a restraining order set from his ex-wife. D-Fens is emotionally unstable at best, not accepting any turned down remarks and always questioning people. Even though he may be causing a ruckus to store owners, restaurant managers and gang members to name a few, we still find D-Fens to be a likable character for stating his message in the most effective ways, whether blood is to be shed or rounds are to be fired.A cop on his last day retirement, played by Robert Duvall, is kept on his toes about this situation, and he will follow down any traces. Even though his co-workers and wife do not approve of this and prefer him to take it easy on his last work day, he won't stop until he gets his hands on D-Fens.Society in general can manage to bring out the worst of us, and Falling Down just proves this further. Sure, it's unethical to cause destruction and mayhem to speak your voice of dissatisfaction, but in this film, all the restraints are broken and the city of Los Angeles is receiving its payback to the mental destruction of this man.

And, for this film, Falling Down, the first half gets 5/5, due to fabulous direction, dialogue, and a real sense of a gun as a leit motif. Im sure that when watching this film, from the start you would be aware that he will get a gun, and he will slowly deteriorate into a murderer. And the start of this film really gives this impression that he is in fact a broken man, prepared to let loose and return societies cruelty, almost comedically meeting different every day frustration that a normal man might, yet making him seem like you or me.However, the second half, i only give 2/5. This is based on the fact that, with a build up of this man prepared to start causing havoc, but fizzles out a bit, as well as losing the leit motif of a gun after he gets one, it seems like it wasn't worth doing in the first place. And his apparent 'killing spree', only involves killing two people, one was an accident, when he gives him a heart attack after firing his shotgun, but also destroying the mans pills. The other was in self defence. I'm not saying that I wanted a violet film, but maybe the suggestion that he was willing to kill anyone to get his way, even if only suggested. I give the second half 1 star for the character portrayal, as it was fabulous and realistic. I gave the other star for inventive ending, giving birth to other brilliant film endings such as that of Gran Torino. It didn't get a star for story, locations or speed. I found a pier too much of a clich√©, and the story progressed far too quickly, for example, the transition between house and pier. Also, the story in the second half was far weaker than that of the first half. In summary, with one of the best opening scenes, and fabulous scene setting, it was let down by a lack of character direction, love him, hate him, feel sorry for him, hate him again, disappointing. But comes back with a fabulous ending.

Along the way, he encounters a number of colorful characters who symbolize personal frustration, impede his desire to go home and ultimately come into his line of fire. Trailing him is humane, veteran cop Prendergast (Robert Duvall) on his last day before retirement determined to bring him in and prevent further bloodshed and destruction.Michael Douglas does a masterful job of conveying the frustration of the disenfranchised. Having lost his job and unable to share liberal visitation with his young daughter, he is a study in both rage and frustration. Despite his violent actions and his unbalanced state, we feel for Douglas' character because some of those he comes up against (the gang members, army surplus store owner) are even more vile than he is. We also identify with the annoyances of traffic jams, overpriced items, self-important country club types and fast food fiascos. He is in many respects the little guy up against an unfair and an uncaring world, his lifelong hard work and duty to self undercut by a system that chews people up and spits them out. Jobless, unable to remain close to those he cares for and unable to adjust to life's curve-balls, he becomes unhinged. Douglas' character (D-FENS) is one we can strongly sympathize with in principle- even if we disagree with his actions.Marring the film is the subplot involving the relationship between Robert Duvall and his unbalanced wife (Tuesday Weld)- a scenario that adds nothing to the film. It is there apparently to show us the humanity in Duvall's character, but it is merely annoying. Also unsatisfying is the dynamic between him and his Captain, a hard-ass type who dislikes Duvall, but whose character is never fully developed.Notwithstanding these criticisms, Falling Down is well worth two hours of your time and a worthy vehicle for Douglas.

I am only doing it now out of some probably-mistaken idea that if I take the time to comment on what I think was a superb movie, not only will it be seen more often, but maybe that the people responsible will even get their due compliments for pursuing their profession so well.01. Michael Douglas gives a very good performance in a very difficult role. Somehow the people who rate such things need something of the platform diving paradigm -- degree of difficulty. A very good performance in a very difficult role is much higher praise than a very good performance in a role that any qualified actor ought to be able to perform in their sleep.02. Robert Duvall, it might be said, especially since I guess I now know that his performance in A Civil Action was, sort of a reprise, is probably panned elsewhere by those who do this often as 'just being Robert Duvall'. I don't think so. I see on the screen an actor of immense skill, immense experience guiding that skill, and a result that was a delivery of what the screen writer and the director asked of him, beyond what they could have hoped from whatever dialog they wrote or stage direction they provided.03. Barbara Hershey could be overlooked, but I think that she played the role, understated as appropriate to the overall production, perfectly. Don't overlook those grainy scenes from their home movies -- that was the actor on stage as well. If you close your eyes and let your memory of the film remind you of the all the women pushed to the side by a film script that ultimately plays two male protagonists against each other, you'll see Tuesday Weld, perhaps over-playing a not-too-attractive role as Mrs. Prendergast, and you'll see the love/fear of Mrs. Foster from Lois Smith, but above all you will think of Foster's ex-wife dealing with a husband forcing a child on to an unwanted rocking horse, and know that a whole lot of acting was powerfully delivered in a low-key style.04. And finally there is my praise of 'tone' -- tone in the photography, tone in the soundtrack, and finally, the philosophical tone of the story as it plays out. I don't know enough about the film business to know to whom that praise should go. First, I have the feeling that the original writing did not do as good a job of managing tone, so I am sure that whoever takes a book or a play and turns it into a movie, did that. Second, I don't know where the naming of the film came from, but it certainly, in retrospect, must bear some of the burden for the generally-low-success the film achieved. There is so much more here than 'falling down'. A title also portends a tone, and the subtle tones of this production were so much more than what anyone scanning the TV listings would expect from Falling Down.As I said up front, I don't do this much, but I suspect that Out of Order, Venice Heat, or even Retired would have worked better. I can also think of a worse title, Lake Havasu, but I think if that showed up on the TV re-run list, it would have at least as good a draw as Falling Down. This film deserves to be seen more than once.

We first see him stuck in a Los Angeles traffic jam, bumper to bumper, sweating and fretting, until he walks away from his stalled car and begins to walk home -- that is, where his divorced wife (Barbara Hershey) and his young daughter live.Some home. (Like that in the John Cheever short story, The Swimmer, it's a fantasy.) As he trudges along in his white shirt, tie, and unhip eyeglasses, he pauses from time to time to phone his wife and tell her he's on his way, because it's his daughter's birthday.I know it's Adel's birthday -- what do you want?, she tells him, adding, I'll call the police if I have to. Meanwhile, Douglas runs into all kinds of obstacles. A street-wise Korean shopkeeper wants to charge him eighty-five cents for a can of Coke (a big laugh, as of this date) and Douglas blows his cork, smashing some merchandise and walking off with the owner's sawed-off baseball bat.Things get worse. He crosses paths with some cholos who demand his money and produce a weapon that, when I was a teenager, was widely known as a Portugese knife. But he clobbers them with his bat and, later, winds up with a gym bag full of their pistols and automatic weapons. Douglas may be a fruitcake but everyone else is mean too. The confrontations continue and the police, represented by Robert Duvall and Rachel Ticotin, finally get wise to him and track him to the Santa Monica pier where he is more or less holding his wife and child hostage. When Duvall tries to place him under arrest, Douglas asks wonderingly, I'm the bad guy? Whatever other things he's lost, self-justification isn't one of them.From what I'd heard, I hadn't expected much of this film -- another revenge story, along the lines of Death Wish. But it's actually fairly complex, despite some clumsy moment and many implausibilities. The film's chief weakness is that, though Douglas is clearly around the bend, everybody who gets a taste of his anger somehow has asked for it. The offense can be major -- trying to gun him down on the street -- or minor -- refusing to serve him from the breakfast menu at a burger joint after eleven thirty.And I don't know if the writer, Ebbe Rowe Smith, intended it this way but both Douglas's ex-wife and Duvall's current wife, played by Tuesday Weld, are both bitches in their different ways. When Douglas has called to say he's on his way home, despite the restraining order, Hershey calls the police and informs them that he has a tendency towards violence. (He pounded on the door after midnight.) The police ask her if he struck his daughter. No. Did he -- strike you? Not exactly. I didn't want to wait until he got around to it. He COULD -- I think. The cop nods knowingly and makes a note. Abusive husband. That's a cheap, stereotypical shot. Douglas has a restraining order against him because he's suspected of perhaps some day possibly committing a violent act within his family. Kind of a unilateral preemptive move on Hershey's part.Duvall's wife, Tuesday Weld, is also a thoroughly formulaic figure -- whining, narcissistic, demanding, hypochondriacal, the clear wearer of the pants in the family. Wardrobe and make up have turned her into an ill-groomed slob, but it would have been truer to the character (Duvall She lost her beauty.) if she had done her desperate best to look good. The two wives may be manipulative but Duvall's partner, Rachel Ticotin, comes off as an admirable figure. Not dazzlingly gorgeous, she nevertheless has good, strong features arranged in an uncontrived manner. And she gives a good performance. So does Lois Smith in the small part of Douglas' uncomprehending mother. Some of the bit parts are so poorly done, they're an embarrassment to watch. Douglas himself can't be considered a wildly expressive performer but he successfully suggests the kind of pressure one might find behind a zit that's about to pop. Robert Duvall has given some magisterial performances early in his career -- M*A*S*H and The Godfather among them -- but here rather walks through the part with a lot of pointless or possibly ironic chuckles.Weaknesses aside, Douglas's character is complicated enough to grip us and the milieu of Los Angeles is captured in all its local color, which varies from indifference to outrage.

Michael Douglas is a lonely man, who has lost his wife and family because of (non-violent) temper fits, has lost his job because of the depression this caused, and now lives with his mother. On his daughter's birthday, stuck in a traffic jam, he suddenly cracks and accepts his life is no longer worth living. He decides to make his way on foot to his ex-wife's house to see his daughter one last time. On the way he meets a variety of ill-wishers - a shopkeeper who won't give him change, gang members, a Fascist and a selfish rich golfer. Now liberated from his usual restraint he meets selfishness and violence with violence. The cop, who has discerned the pattern of this rampage, despite the disbelief of his colleagues, finally confronts him. Douglas pretends to have a gun and is killed. On one level the story is about two people with difficult lives, and how one copes and the other doesn't. On another level it is a serious question about how our society tolerates all kinds of behaviour, and yet destroys someone whose intentions are fundamentally good. As Douglas says during the film I'm the bad guy? How'd that happen?

While stuck in a traffic jam, William Foster/D-Fens (Douglas) gets out of his car, and leaves the car right where it is. He starts walking through Los Angeles. When Foster first starts out, he seems to be lost as to what he wants to do and where he is headed. Then his journey becomes a quest to get a birthday gift to his daughter. He must get from Point A to Point B. As the movie progresses and he makes his way towards his ex-wife's house, we see that some of life's simple things become more important to him. We see him enter a fast food restaurant and order a breakfast meal, only to be told that he is a few minutes late and they won't take his order for that meal. What takes place in the following scene is Foster's drastic solution to a simple problem, giving new meaning to the old Burger King slogan  Have It Your Way. The plot has Foster go through a series of everyday challenging situations and solving them in an unconventional way. Actor Fredrick Forrest's performance as Nick the racist surplus store-owner is exceptional and convincing. Joel Schumacher does an impeccable job directing this particular scene. In fact, the entire film shows Schumacher's expertise in the directing field. As the movie progresses, you will get to know the character of Foster, and even though you realize he is no longer rational and on a rampage, you find yourself rooting for him as he deals with some of the mutants of today's society. Robert Duval is superb in portraying Prendergast, the Los Angeles's detective who tries to figure out which direction D-Fens is headed. Falling Down's writer Ebbe Roe Smith shows how Foster and Prendergast each deal with the future of their lives. He allows us to feel the frustration of becoming obsolete and dispensable. Keep an open mind and you will see this movie represents real life feelings in today's world. When viewed from that perspective, it can be a more rewarding film than what is portrayed at surface level. This movie provides good entertainment and is well worth seeing.

William Foster (Michael Douglass)is down on his luck. He is an unemployed over-educated defense worker in LA. After he begins to see faults in society he decides he is going to break a restraining order from his wife and go and see her and his daughter. He doesn't ask for trouble but soon is faced with it from various people just looking to put down problems. After he destroys a convenient store over a can of Coke, Officer Prendergast (Robert Duvall) begins to hunt across town, following a series of rampage left behind by Foster. Foster is the clear example of a troubled person who just wants to be happy but can't find it. As he lashes out against people in his way, you realize what he really wants, just to go home for his daughter's birthday. The film is impressive on many standards. First it is a film that doesn't involve a young, hateful teenager lashing out but an educated, respected man doing so. The dark sides of LA are visually expressed stunningly and each scumbag he comes across you feel right with him as he yells or punches him.The film is a tad violent but still is well done. Douglass and Duvall perform perfectly and the combination of certain personalities in each character caught my eye as this being one of the first movies I've seen to do that.Falling Down.

His airconditioning broke down, he can't open his windows, he gets annoyed by a fly in his car and by what is happening around him... Don't we all know the feeling sometimes? And than it happens, something snaps in his head and he steps out of his car. He leaves his car, saying that he's going home. On his way home he meets all kinds of people who annoy him for one reason or another. When they don't get out of his way soon enough he responds in a violent way, even though he isn't really a violent man.When you see this movie you will probably sympathize with the guy. You see that he's having a hard time. And last but not least, he does what you always wanted to do, but never dared. Perhaps that is where the strength of this movie can be found in.

Then, our empathy for him naturally drops a bit...sure he's in despair and understandably angry, but should he be killing all these people? They play up the comedy angles to make it bearable.Meanwhile, Duvall's character is experiencing early in the film rather than expressing, e.g. feeling the weirdness of being a short-timer at work.  The scene with the captain trying to talk him out of quitting is priceless.  He says no and really means it.  Then at the end he winds up talking *himself* out of quitting, and that's when he has something to *say*.  Hence most of Duvall's lines are nearer the end. I think it was a logical solution.A wonderful performance from Duvall, as usual.  And the best role of Douglas's career IMO; something other than the super-successful over-confident sneering jerk he so often plays.

What really surprised me was that it was made and released 10 years ago.   But I'm not going to give away any of the story in this comment, therefore - No Spoilers.Falling Down is not so much an extraordinary motion picture as it is was and is visionary.   Robert Duvall and Michael Douglas not only had a magnificent script to work with, but they themselves turned in extraordinary performances.  Duvall is always the character he plays, and in this movie, Michael Douglas was almost unrecognizable as the motion picture hero I had become accustomed to.   Most motion pictures are simply entertainment as they should be and are gross exaggerations of reality in a very positive light as we the viewers would like to see life, not as the lives we face daily really are.   But Falling Down, though not something that happens everyday in America, is about how much a person can take in our socioeconomic culture before breaking.   And more and more people are breaking.   Most aren't hiking across a city reeking destruction, but many are withdrawing into cocoons of not wanting to know, while many more are reported slipping into Clinical Depressions as life does not work out as the Great American dream we all once believed in, or at least I did.   We like to think of ourselves as living in the greatest country in the World.   The U.S. is the certainly most powerful country in the World for the moment, but our greatness began disappearing in the late 60's and early 70's, and has been slip sliding away since.   This motion picture is about living in the most powerful country in the world, but no longer the greatest - nor the easiest.   It's hard living in the United States of America.   Maybe not as hard as Russia, China, or India; much less Afghanistan or Iraq, but in a country where we do not live as relaxed with the established historical cultures as, for example, in England, France, Italy, or even Germany.   Remembering the first time I heard someone say, Love it or Leave it during the Vietnam War era and then hearing another say, The Roman Empire collapsed and the Italians relaxed - I remembered those cries for help so long ago.   In our culture, we are not yet relaxed and this movie is a prime example, though exaggerated, of how not relaxed we are.  My compliments to Duvall, Douglas, Ebbe Roe Smith, the writer, and Joel Schumacher, the director, for making this movie and for doing it an entire decade ago.   That in itself is remarkable; that they Ebbe Roe Smith and Joel Schumacher both saw what was happening while the rest of us were watching the Stock Market bubble expand and thinking everything was getting better.I very highly recommend this movie and further recommend that those who are really interested in where we are in America purchase this motion picture and watch it several times a year as the future unfolds concerning the American Empire and our attempts to superimpose our culture on the rest of the World - something that is not going to work nor happen.Again, Falling Down is an outstanding work and very worthwhile to own and watch.

This movie truly shows how life is unfair and sometimes you just feel like going over the edge. Michael Douglas should play characters like this much more often, because he's so much better at it then that victim he plays in all of his other movies. This should be the movie that Michael Douglas is known for. He plays a guy in which you don't know whether you should love or hate. Many scenes are actually quite funny too, providing some comic relief. One of the main reasons why I like this film so much is that Michael Douglas actually plays a character that everyman can relate to. In most of his other movies he always seems to play cocky rich guy, most notably Wall Street, where he plays the kind of guy you just want to see killed. But this is a much different role for Douglas. Anyone can relate to and empathize with Douglas' character in this film.Overall, this is a terrific film that shows how people can be pushed over the edge. I would recommend it to anybody. 10/10.

Those days where your life turns to crap and you feel like punching everyone in the face.  That's why I can sympathize with Douglas' character.  He's having a bad day and he simply wants to get through it without people p**sing him off.  Of course, he's a short fuse, but what fun would this story be if the character were mild-mannered?Douglas' methods of dealing with his anger are quite unorthodox, but if you had the courage to do so and didn't have laws inhibiting you from doing so, you would destroy a man's store for overcharging you for a can of Coke (85 cents?  Come on!  I don't know a single store around me that charges over 75 cents for a CAN of soda!) or murder the gang members who tried to pester you for trespassing on their property.  I was cheering when Douglas beat the living daylights out of those 2 thugs.  Some of the things he did are pretty ridiculous, but that's what makes him a flawed character.  When I watch a movie, I tend to sympathize more with characters who aren't straitlaced and likable in a conventional sense, because I feel more of a connection to them (i.e.  Kevin Spacey in American Beauty).  I believe we're all demented in some sort of way; Hollywood has a way of making their sympathetic characters way too sympathetic because they're afraid audiences will become intimidated.  Oh boo-hoo!  I'm sure I'm gonna read quite a few comments saying how difficult it is to like a film where the main character's not that likable.  Sure, pulling a gun on a fast food manager and cashier for not serving breakfast is pretty darn crazy--and what he does afterwards is even crazier--but we all do crazy things!  Maybe not as outlandish as that, but crazy nonetheless.But when it all boils down to it, his intentions are pure.  He just wants to go home to see his daughter and hand her a birthday present.  The store owner mistakes him for a theif and tells him, Take everything in the register!  He doesn't want to steal from the owner; he feels the owner is stealing from him for charging 85 cents for a can of Coke.  When he lowers the price to 50 cents, he stuffs a dollar in the register, removes 50 cents in change which he needs to make a phone call and leaves.  As he says, I'm just defending my rights as a consumer.  And when he hides in that rich family's backyard, suspecting that the cops are coming, the father tells him to take him along, thinking he's holding them hostage.  Douglas replies, I have a family of my own.  His recurrent line is I'm just trying to go home.  Through all his anger, you can see spurts of humanity in his character.  For example, when the Nazi gunshop owner throws the snowglobe, which Douglas hoped to give to his daughter, against the wall, he cries out No!  He doesn't want to kill anybody, he doesn't want to steal from anybody, he just wants to go home to his daughter.Douglas' performance is great, one of the best of his career.  And it was also a wonderfully written part for him.  Robert Duvall also gives a fine performance as a straitlaced, mild-mannered but highly committed detective on his last day of work.  And boy is Rachel Ticotin--one of the very few female stars of Con Air--one hot babe!  Joel Schumacher's direction is quite vivid and uses a color pallette that gives the audience a feel of the sweltering Los Angeles heat--much like Spike Lee displayed Bed-Stuy's hottest day of the year in Do the Right Thing.  This movie took me on a wild ride that's both bursting with excitement and darkly hilarious. Yes, I laughed a lot during the film, mostly at Douglas' witty one-liners which delighted me even more, since I was able to sympathize with his character.My score  9 (out of 10) "},{"Title":"A truly depressing film, with a lot of great stuff.","Date":"15 December 2002","Score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Crime, Drama, Thriller","Review":"  I'm not really even sure why I like this film so much, in fact I'm not so sure that I did the first time I viewed it.  Since then I've seen it a few times and can now truly appreciate this film.  The story is fairly simple, but done so well that you just can't wait to see what happens next.Michael Douglas pulls off one of his best performances to date as William Foster, a man that has finally had it with the pressures and annoyances of life and just looses all control.  Robert Duvall pulls off another great performance, as Officer Prendergast, although very similar to various other roles that he has done.  Barbara Hershey is fantastic in the film as the former wife of William Foster.  She really shows in her character how truly scared she is for her daughter and what William will do.  Rachel Ticotin is another bonus in the film as Prendergast's partner/friend.  She does a very good job with her role.Joel Schumacher pulls off another great directorial effort.  He seems to be a truly exceptional director from the films of his that I've seen thus far (with exception of the Batman & Robin debacle of course).  He seems to very good with intense films such as this film, 8mm, A Time to Kill, The Client, Flatliners and so on.  Keep up the good work Joel.This film is full of scenes that I really, truly love.  I love how most of the situations in the film could be completely avoided if people would just be a little nicer to each other or understanding, but instead, they have to be jerks about it and make things difficult, and thus escalating the tension in the situation.  I really liked that when push came to shove with William, he didn't show any mercy and taught whoever that person may be a lesson (more so in the beginning of the film, the scenes get more and more intense as the film progresses, by the end of the film he has far surpassed simple lessons).  William is quite an interesting character, because he does have a temper and is a truly disturbed individual, but he is actually quite kind and caring in his heart.  By the end of the film, you can't help but feel for him, but still keeping in mind that he's got some major issues.I definitely wouldn't recommend this film to just anyone.  I would only recommend this film to people that really like intense dramatic films that are rather depressing.  Although, if you just want to see some great acting, then this is a great choice.  If you do end up seeing the film, I genuinely hope that you enjoy it as much as I did.  Even if you don't like it so much the first time, give a second chance.  I guess after writing this review, I now realize why I like this film so much.

Part of the appeal stems from the fact that it pulls the audience everywhere, from the riproaringly funny instances of violence, that probably were intended to be so, through to shock, apprehension, laughter again and ultimately poignancy, while never losing the grim realities of urban America. Falling down has been described as a political film, or certainly a film with a political message running throughout and I dont dispute this for one second. With the characters it inroduces, even fleetingly, it asks some tough questions about peoples attitudes in a city where millions coexist, which in turn diminishes the respect that people should have for one another. Ultimately the films conclusion has society as the loser and I felt this really hit home. One mans struggle to cope is not his own failure, but rather that of the people who govern him. The smaller story concerning Roberts Duvall's seasoned cop runs in parallel with the main plot but eventually links in beautifully. The role was a complex one that Duvall just fitted perfectly, right down to the cops jacket size. Douglas likewise was good as the mentally unbalanced white collar worker, with the disturbing side of his character reinforced by a very good musical score. However, as his encounters with his fellow citizens begin to add up, its then that the audience realise that there are more distasteful people out there. The scene with the Nazi in particular stood out, as it went from being hilarious to disturbing very, very quickly. This film also makes the audience aware of the prejudices of modern America in which the white man, with a white shirt and tie is easily tracked through gangland territory, where, as Duvall reasons What would a man with a white shirt and tie be doing in...Gangland? A good film with a very good ending that leaves the audience with a strong message and feeling of sadness.

Foster is not a nice guy, he is not a good father, he is in fact a racist, xenophobic all over unpleasant guy, who in fact mirrors much of what is in society today, who in fact we identify with and mistakenly call heroes or anti-heroes in this case. I am the bad guy, how did that happen, says it all, he is the bad guy, and most of us don't get it.A strange and wonderful movie with some great commentary on us as people, and our society as well. There is nothing in this movie to make us feel good about ourselves, other than the way Duvall deals with his life, his issues, his struggle. Foster is a failure, a loser, someone wrapped up in his own problems, angry with society - too much like many of us in society today.

Without a job or a relationship to worry about he suddenly becomes aware of the dire state of society around him, the very same society that he so eagerly tried to protect form the commies in the past. This film is only partly about the 'falling down' of a single character. D-FENS' transformation from well-respected citizen to gun- slinging maniac is closely linked with his learning process, i.e. his rising awareness of the rotten state of society around him. His idealised notion of  America is gradually replaced by the more realistic but also very painful certainty that his values (eg honesty) are terribly old-fashioned. Nowadays, the heroes are plastic surgeons. Nowadays, the 10 year olds can teach you how to handle a rocket launcher. Nowadays, immigrants show no interest in becoming Americans anymore. Freedom of movement is a thing of the past, you've got to watch out for gangland graffiti now.The list goes on and on. This is a pessimistic movie. Or is it a realistic movie? Watch it and find out.

When you are in the grocery store you don't mind getting out of other peoples way but then it seems like you are the only one providing that courtesy. In situations like these one gets perturbed. Because of this it is very easy to watch Falling Down and yell things at the screen like 'Yeah, Man!' and 'Nice one!' But we must avoid getting carried away with these feelings and remember the golden rule. Stress is a killer. The Douglas character doesn't understand why he is the bad guy despite the fact that many people he has encountered are the dead guys. When watching this movie you get a strange feeling. You are supposed to root for the guy but you're glad he's not anyone you know.

Luckily i ignored them and Falling Down turned out to be one of my favourite movies of the 1990s or any other decade.

There is more than a hint of Grand Theft Auto about this film. We see the narrative unfolding from the point of view of Michael Douglas and the police, but it's mainly Douglas' view that I'm talking about. We see how he starts out in his car, stationary, literally going nowhere. Then he realizes his mission he has to go home. So you can imagine a little arrow pointing in the direction of 'home', in this case the already well trodden GTA neighborhood of Venice Beach, and off he goes as the crow flies. On his way he fights with the convenience store owner and gets his first weapon upgrade, a baseball bat. He quickly upgrades again to a flick-knife but things really take off when he gets a whole bag full of guns following a botched drive-by shooting.Along the way he gets distracted from his mission. He shoots up a burger place, shoots up a phone box and blows up a construction site. This impulsive drive to release all the tension that's been building up in this guy's head is great to watch and is so similar to how most of us play GTA that it's uncanny. The best part, for me, wanton violence and destruction of irritating stuff aside, is when he's in his final confrontation with Robert Duval. It's the moment that he realizes that he's not the hero of his story, but the bad guy. This, again, resonates in some of the more cerebral video-games of today, perhaps most notably Shadow of the Colossus. Obviously, the films has influences of its own but that's not for now. I do love the Macbeth-inspired soliloquy on the 'point of no return'. That was a masterstroke. The point is that, like most good films, there's more than one way to read this. And I like the fact that you can view it in many different ways. It means I'll watch it again, and again, and again.

William Foster's trek across L.A. shows us a non-homogeneous look at the city. Douglas's Foster is an anti-hero. You root for him but can't quite ignore the danger of his break. His pathetic life becomes superimposed on other people's pathetic little lives, any of which probably strike too close to home for many viewers. You may identify with at least one of the characters way too much to be comfortable for you. Robert Duvall does some of his best work as Detective Prendergast who has to deal with his burden of boorish co-workers and shrewish wife (played very well by Tuesday Weld). Rachel Ticotin is Prendergast's partner, Detective Sandra (that's it, no last name), who is the kind of co-worker we all wish we could have. (An aside here, Ticotin is one of those actors who doesn't come to mind when you think of the great ones, but look at her work. It is always good, maybe so good that she becomes lost in the character instead of maintaining her own identity. Isn't that the mark of a great actor?) Falling Down is a bittersweet look at the end of one man's life attended by people with similar lives who handled their challenges differently.

The reviewer said that the film not only vilified guns, but also said that there was no way to stop this kind of guns on the streets. We didn't get the chance to rent it that week so I checked out a few scenes online and was so impressed by the few scenes that I saw that I went right out and bought it. Now, you may be thinking that was a foolish decision on my part. I was worried that I may have bought a movie with a few good scenes and two hours of fluff, but it was a chance I was willing to take. The decision, despite it being impulsive, was one of the best movie purchases I have ever made.Falling Down is about a typical man named Bill Foster, who is played by Michael Douglas. Now, I will admit that when I first saw that Michael Douglas was the lead, it sort of turned me away a little bit. I'd seen earlier films of his, and it seems like he always plays the same character. Some rugged tough guy struggling with issues and what-not. I thought that way until I saw Falling Down. His performance completely blew me away. I was not expecting such a subtle, yet tortured character, much less such an obviously screwed-up one.Foster just got laid off from his job at the defense department who is stuck in bumper-to-bumper traffic on the day of one of the hottest days in Los Angeles. His stress doubles so much that the simple noises of bratty children fighting or people honking their horns in frustration become magnified to an almost unbearable level. He instantly gets out of his car and walks away, abandoning it. At this point, you may be able to tell that Foster isn't exactly a person who is mentally well. But who could blame him? Foster starts walking to get to his daughter's birthday party, which is across town in Venice, and as the minor annoyances we all face become unbearable, he decides that he won't put up with it anymore and goes on a rampage through the streets of Los Angeles. It's almost as if it's a game of Grand Theft Auto. One thing leads to another, and he's walking down Hollywood with a gym bag full of guns. I suppose you can see where things are going from here. What follows is a disturbing, yet somehow strangely hilarious series of events where Foster starts a one-man war on the system that shunned him. There's also a detective that won't quit pursuing him, but this is difficult because Foster is always one step ahead of him. Sure, he may be going berserk, but it is in an understandable way. Foster isn't really hurting anybody, he's just lashing out at the society that he once loved, and the society that loved him back. Foster is a relic of another time, a time when people had respect for each other. He doesn't like what he's doing; he almost feels that he has to. He's confused and he just wants to try and make people understand what's wrong with society so things can get better. The ending is very suspenseful and one of the most beautiful and tragic endings I have ever seen.The cast was incredible. Not only do we receive a spellbinding performance from Michael Douglas, but we also get a lovable performance from Robert Duvall as a soon-to-be-retired detective. I was surprised at Duvall's performance as well. I haven't ever seen Duvall in such a role before. Duvall knows that the city is a terrible place, but he isn't trying to make it perfect. He's trying to do whatever he can to make it better. Barbara Hershey also does an excellent job as the ex-wife of Foster, who is afraid of him. What makes this even more tragic is that Foster doesn't know why she is afraid of him, and even thinks that they are still married. The only thing I would have changed with the cast is perhaps giving Foster more screen time, and dropping the subplot about Duvall's marriage.This may be the only comedy-drama besides Dog Day Afternoon that not only compels you with its intriguing and disturbing storyline, but it makes both the comedy and the realism work.An interesting scene involves a man who is Not Economically Viable protesting outside of the bank that denied him a loan. As everyone else on the street ignores him, Foster pays attention to him. Foster obviously sympathizes with this man who is also being stepped on by society. As the man is escorted away in the police car he looks directly at Foster and says don't forget me. In a gesture of empathy, he acknowledges this. When they look at each other, it is as though they are looking into a mirror and seeing the same thing a victim of society. Another scene I always thought was really sad was where Foster remarked that a plastic surgeon has a better house than him, who keeps the country safe. That really tugged at my heartstrings, because it's true. The most important and hardworking people in this country get absolutely nothing in return from the country they spend their lives serving.Overall, this is a very original and sad film. Not depressing, tragic. Even though Foster is supposed to be the villain, you identify with what he's feeling and you start to, oddly enough, sympathize with the man. Falling Down isn't a revenge movie. Nobody is supposed to cheer. It's meant to be both tragic and amusing with its shatteringly violent path of destruction that Foster is carving into the city. It really shows what this man is going through and makes you feel for him. That's quite an achievement.

At the heart of Falling Down is a fast-paced action movie, and the psychological depth and social condemnation of Taxi Driver is nowhere to be found. However, the film does do a terrific job of throwing the viewer into the protagonist's neurotic, claustrophobic state of mind with minimalistic but effective editing and camera work.Veterans Michael Douglas and Robert Duvall put a lot of heart into characters who, on paper, are little more than clich√©s. In the end, what makes Falling Down work so well is that in spite of a script quite rich in clich√©s and one-liners, it feels like an intimate independent film as much as a Hollywood action blockbuster.

Look no further. As a kid I always saw the City of Angels as a glamorous, exotic place, since most movies back then were set there. But upon watching falling down at the age of 14 I went off it completely. I no longer saw it as a bustling metropolis of wealth and sunshine, but as a fragmented, angry, unjust place barely able to call itself a society.Michael Douglas stars as William Foster, a middle-aged, middle-management schlub working at a defence company who suddenly finds himself obsolete in an increasingly chaotic, senseless world. Stuck in heavy traffic one morning, he suddenly snaps, leaves his car, and crosses LA on foot en route to his daughter's birthday party. Along the way he has many encounters with what sadly passes as modern humanity. Only now he's just not going to sit by and tolerate it. He's not choosing apathy like the rest of his fellow citizens. Foster (or D-FENS) fights back face to face, unapologetically, And you know what...he's right every time.Robert Duvall plays Prendergast, the cop who puts together the pieces of D-Fens' rampage. The two men are as far apart as they are so close, but none of the LAPD care much for Prendergast's suspicions.The lazy, arrogant, ignorant, disinterested cops are the only weak link in Ebbe Roe Smith's otherwise tight screenplay (you might remember him as 'Jim Bob' in Fletch Lives). Creating stupid characters to further the drama is just too easy, and every time one of them speaks it really drags the movie down.Joel Schumacher's career has been filled with ups and downs (Batman and Robin certainly ain't one of the 'ups'), but Falling Down proves that he can be a good director when he wants to, regardless of how wildly inconsistent his track record is. James Newton Howard also contributes a nice score (which has never been released), but really this is Douglas' film. He's often funny without even meaning to be. D-Fens is just speaking his mind, but still his views come across as controversial or intolerant. If only more people had the courage to take a stand against injustice in real life instead of 'just dealing with it'.Idiot cop characters aside, Falling Down is one of Douglas's best, and perhaps more relevant now than it was in 1993.

True, even in the good old days there were problems, but the world was better at the time. The world has changed a lot and everything that surrounds it, even more so since we entered in the 2000 generation. And progress just keeps changing the world and everything fast, way too fast. The world has gone crazy.Michael Douglas is the main protagonist. While he does a great portrayal of the character William Foster, better than his performance is the character himself. It's an unusual role by Michael Douglas and that's what makes the movie interesting. The role he portrays is the reflex of this generation. People are always in rush, under pressure and stress nowadays. Exactly like Douglas's character. The big difference is that Douglas's character found a way to throw up all his fury by doing things that most of us wouldn't have the guts to, no matter how much urge we felt to. You've gotta admire this guy for that.William Foster does very wrong things, but I understand just how he feels and what he is going through. The demands and fierceness of society, the pressures, the frustrations, the stress, the nerves... all of that can lead to insanity. Don't we all just want to explode at times, just like Douglas's character? I'm sure that we all feel like this in certain times of our lives.Deep down, Foster ain't a bad guy. He is just an ordinary guy who has become so stressed and frustrated that he has come to a point which he can't hide his anger anymore. That is obvious on his variable temper. He is enraged, disturbed, confused and makes sardonic observations on life and other stuff.Basically the story is about him, a normal man declaring war against his daily frustrations across the city of Los Angeles and at the same time trying to get home for his daughter's birthday party. And it all happens in only one day! A very hot Summer day, to be precise.Not everything is good, though. I hate the Nazi guy and the whole sequence with him.

It's really one of the best, most thought-provoking films of the 1990s. It's filled with ideas and sharp observations from the first scene to the last. At the beginning, when D-Fens is stuck in traffic, you really get to feel how stressful and numbing the situation is for him. The scene is shot in an unusual way, with a close focus on what's surrounding his small car. The last important scene is an emotional tour-de-force. Michael Douglas gives one of his best performances as William D-Fens Foster, a working class hero. He just wants to get home to see his family, but the ills of a big American city keep getting in his way. These confrontations are thrilling, but also funny in a black comedy kind of way. Douglas is really the heart of the film. Robert Duvall, however, is also impressive as Sergeant Martin Prendergast. His character is a reasonable man but with problems of his own. He has it better than D-Fens. Still, in a way he understands what D-Fens is going through. Falling Down reminded me of Come And See (1985), a great war film. It's structured just like that film, and just like that film it has a powerful ending. Maybe Falling Down was influenced by Come And See. Falling Down is one of several Hollywood films of the late 1980s and early 1990s that fall under the white man as a victim category. It's undoubtedly the best of them. In addition to the action it features beautiful cinematography. The neighborhoods that D-Fens passes through aren't exactly pretty, but they're photographed very well, and Andrzej Bartkowiak captures the look of a hot day perfectly. One of my favorite things about the film is that it has that early 1990s Hollywood look. I guess this is because of the cameras that were used at that time. Cameras these days capture colors perfectly, but the films end up looking too realistic, kind of dull I might say. Falling Down is great and entertaining. I highly recommend it.

It has a familiar place on most retail shelves, but isn't often mentioned. I myself had never heard anyone talk about it until someone recommended it to me roughly about a week ago. It's early Schumacher, coming out some time before he ruined the Batman franchise, and it seems like one of his little secrets, only there for those who find it word of mouth.Starting with a less surreal take-off of the opening scene of 8 1/2, Falling Down follows a new day in the life of D-fens, a white collar man who decides in the middle of a traffic jam to play hookey, only to find himself suddenly seeing the decay around him with a little more clarity. At first he simply rants and raves and attempts to get a breath of fresh air, but as he continually finds himself under pressure (and habitually gains access to more and more weapons), his personal momentum builds into a violent and scathing criticism of everything that gets in his way--which covers many facets of society, luckily enough.Believe me, there's some catharsis to be felt from this one. Ever gone to McDonalds and just wanted a McMuffin, but arrived five minutes too late for the breakfast menu? Watch this movie, it'll help you feel better. Ever wanted to put both gangsters and rich country club yuppies in their place? Watch this movie, it'll make you feel fine. Ever wanted to believe you could turn your mundane life into going out in a blaze of glory? Well, if you relate enough to this guy, you might just be the type to snap, too.Michael Douglas' performance helps a lot. What could be a twisted and schlocky movie becomes endearingly personal and tragic with Douglas' mopey face. Robert Duvall plays a nice counterpoint as the policeman who, like D-fens, always played by the rules, but whose stress is eventually making him question the logic of following the system. And scattered throughout are some rather brilliant single moments of epiphany as D-fens rants about the minor things that make society so frustrating, from disgusting cheeseburgers to inflation to questioning the point of most construction.I will admit there's some ways in which I don't agree with this film, for instance his taking his rage out on some of the smaller workers who probably don't really care for their jobs in the first place. The retail employee in me cringes when I think of how over-used The Customer Is Always Right! and What About My Consumer Rights! are for means of bringing a stressed out, semi-paranoid, frustrated person into a public rant. D-fens constantly rails against the lack of caring and personalization in service as one of the many chips in society's glossy facade, but in a way its the very convenience he craves that has led to a major lack of interpersonal connection. My thing is, if you don't want the hamburger, then don't pay for it and don't eat it--but whatever you do, don't pull out a gun on minimum wage workers, they have crappy lives anyway.Nevertheless, this movie comes from a very strong place and has a lot to say about the various levels in which we've all fallen out of sync. For those looking for a somewhat more violent, massively darker Office Space, Falling Down is that movie to unwind with after having a very, very long day.

Falling Down is an absolute classic for the underrepresented genre that exists all on its own, with only it to represent it 'bleak present' sums it up.The story is done eloquently, from the beginning scene of high tension from daily routine to the maddening rush of road rage. There are characters throughout the film that are built upon fear. The director has deftly carved out such people such as the ultra-racist, the lonesome old hag, and the need for defense in the simple lives of Americans.Once in a while a film such as this arrives in Hollywood, with a major star in our case, Douglas, in its title role. It brings up the problems that plague our daily lives, the rut of its cyclic nature, and the need to get away from it all, the latter of which is expounded by Duvall. The overall film is shot like a simple action film, but it takes a wider eye to pick out that it is not your average Bruce Willis film here.There are some chintzy dialogue issues, as with all films, but mostly we are sympathetic to the cause of the protagonist &#150; a man who has nearly completely reversed his role in life, from defender to offender, and had no choice in this downfall. Is it possible to be good and evil at once? It seems that our main character has become so unaffected by his own wrongdoing to see that he has lost his sight, and it makes him all the dramatic and attractive.If it were so simple that he was falling indefinitely into villainy, we might not be as thoughtful and attentive, but he has a deep social calling. There are some amazing points that our hero brings out in his adventure. What are golf courses, Douglas asks at one point, about this waste of space, in the height of his transition into his end.Of course, there is the aspect of sacrifice. We all have to surrender something in order to gain something &#150; but at what cost? When does 'economically inviable' turn into a breach of our own values and lives? Falling Down seeks to answer such questions, if not with extremity, then with grace and ethereal sadness.RATING 9.5 /10 I've passed the point of no return. You when that is? That's point in the journey when its longer to go back to the beginning then it is to continue to the end.

Michael Douglas is at his irascible best as a civil servant unhinged by modern life, divorce and redundancy and driven to a series of psychotic acts by a relentlessly hot LA. His road-trip style rant turns into a pursuit as Robert Duvall, an equally disaffected cop, recognises his doppelganger and sets off after him despite disparaging colleagues.The film succeeds in making something of all of this, but the product is simply a happy mean. The set pieces have a tendency to take on a life of their own (and a danger of a proxy mouthpiece for Schumacher?) The rich possibilities for comparing the two lead characters' situations are only basically explored; the end of the film doesn't provide either with redemption or real catharsis (although Duvall's final word to his boss is a super exception to this). But it's never slack and certainly enjoyable for all Schumacher's heavy-handedness there's also a lightness of touch (the subplot concerning Duvall's daughter). 6/10 "},{"Title":"greatest film ever.","Date":"24 August 2005","Score":"2 out of 3 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Crime, Drama, Thriller","Review":" Unbelievable.

Frederic Forrest is kinda funny as the neo-Nazi surplus store owner but it's really not enough.  The fast-food outlet segment is sicko-stuff - if he's really got a gripe, why not go and protest to the fat cat executives and not hassle people on minimum wage. We must be told about 15 times in the first 10 minutes that it is Duvall's last day on the job...The movie is so incredibly predictable. At times, the film verges on so bad, it's good but like most of Schumacher's oeuvre it is just plain bad.  I watched it on DVD and the only thing that could sustain my interest was swapping between languages. Basically, the premise of the film is fundamentally flawed.  D-FENS believes he can do whatever he wants 'cause he has to see his daughter on her birthday. So that means other peoples' lives don't count for zip...he loses all respect for other peoples' concerns and he is actually the aggressive invader interrupting people living their lives.

The movie I was derivative (the opening sequence with our hero stuck in traffic was stolen from Fellini, except there he was transported to heaven, as I recall.  Also, everything this flick had to say was said in Scorsese's Taxi Driver.  And said better), exploitative and cartoonish.  Firstly, and I don't think this is a spoiler (but I don't want to be blacklisted), the movie undercuts it's own intentions by revealing fairly early on, that D-Fens is (as Brad Pitt says of Kevin Spacey in yet another, better movie) a nutbag.  I could not find any common ground with this character, because he is insane.  Perhaps he was only borderline psychotic before the unfortunate events that precipitate the events in this film, but he is NOT any kind of everyman.  If he were, this would be a better movie. Also, I find most of the characters he interacts with drawn with a crayon and sledgehammer.  The Gangbangers, the Oriental shopkeeper, Fredrick Forest's Nazi army/navy store owner...not real people at all.  And D-Fens simply walks away each of his confrontations, carrying a huge bag full of weapons.  Imagine, a nerdy, white guy with a pocket protecter, brittling with firepower, walking away from a huge car crash (where he shoots a defensless gangmember who is spraled on the sidewalk), in what appears to be South Central in LA...and NOBODY SEES HIM!

At this moment he is weighing in his mind what he has in life to hold on for and discovers...nothing! No job, no home, no family and in-turn no self respect. In response to this epiphany he decides to simply perform a basic act of visiting his involuntarily estranged daughter as there is no logical justification that he doesn't. Woven into this story are many excellent examples of how things such as Political Correctness and the state of mind that it induces have transformed the world we live in into a living hell. Not just Political Correctness but the whole no you can't, just in case culture of the modern world e.g. D-FENS Restraining Order has been granted not because of any violent acts he has committed but because there were times when I thought he might. Just as Prendergast's restriction to desk duty that his wife insists on is based on him being wounded once in the line of duty. It begs the question of what should we do instead, just in case something might go wrong, nothing? And isn't the living I hell of the world that that philosophy in practice has created worse than the potentially negative outcomes of taking the risks of maybe hurting yourself or someone else or offending someone?The film is rich in allegory and metaphor with a clear parallel to draw between it's pro and antagonist. At the beginning of the movie D-FENS has lost everything; job, home, family and Prendergast is a man who has lost his only child and is on the brink of an involuntary premature retirement that will mean he will lose his last vestige of manhood and self-respect, in short, his feelings toward D-FENS are ones of empathy. The climax of the film, which is where the richest metaphor lies in that the two stand at the end of a pier, in Los Angeles(the western-most tip of the western world) where D- FENS is held at gun-point; where he is offered the option of surrendering his miserable existence on one side of the bars for the other when he does what is essentially the simultaneously selfless and selfish thing in one by bluffing Prendergast into a Draw- on-three when he is not really armed. This action is selfish for the obvious reason that D- FENS gets to commit suicide by-proxy(in-turn not facing the consequences of his actions) but selfless in that at the price of his courage to enter a confrontation without knowing that a safe outcome is guaranteed Prendergast gets to experience the uncertainty of life and the enjoyment of triumphing over it and in-turn realizes that his job may be the only thing he has to hold onto that stops him falling down the abyss that D-FENS has.This movie is brilliant because as a fan of post- apocalypse movies, which commonly come in the Sci-fi genre, this one is on it's own in that it is a contemporary post- apocalypse movie rich in many opposites; hope and despair, tragedy and comedy, with no clear hero or villain and the only thing setting D-FENS apart from anyone he comes into confrontation with being that D-FENS has consciously chosen to surrender his responsibility to society whereas his rivals have likely never asked such questions. One might say that this is a story of too much, too late; when D-FENS protests I did everything they told me I would respond by saying that that was what on a large scale had created the world we live in which these days when I see people pushing shopping carts, digging through trash, trying to find something of value to sell to make ends meet between welfare cheques I can't help but to conclude that this movie was ahead of it's time.

But, I would say that his role in this film easily equals it, if not betters it in its own way given that Douglas has to take on a character of a type of man who isn't always acknowledged - a man with mental health issues who slips into a breakdown and goes to war with society. That role is hard to take on, and hard to make successful, because although people want to root for the underdog, as we find out, Douglas is no underdog in this film. Falling Down starts at the beginning of 'D-FENS' (Douglas' character of no name), in a traffic jam, stressed, on the verge of a breakdown. Finally, his mind cracks and he simply says 'I'm going home'. This starts his warped, violent journey across various neighbourhoods in Los Angeles, from gangland to construction sites, to the rich areas and finally the coast where his journey comes to an end. In between his mindset continues to become darker and darker and the violence he uses to get what he wants becomes stronger and stronger. He starts with a and ends with a gun. It appears,at first, that he is the voice of the average man, someone who is being treated badly by his employer, his ex wife, and society in general. And, at first, perhaps we fall for it. But, it soon becomes apparent that 'D-Fens' isn't just an average men, he's part of the same problem, the same sick society that has caused him to snap. He's no longer the underdog, he's a menace and a danger to those he is supposed to care for, and it can only end one way. I suppose this is almost a warped, darker version of Clint Eastwood/Sergio Leone's A Fistful of Dollars, set in the present. Douglas is the only American actor who could pull something like this off. He takes a character that is by nature terribly ill, terribly sick, and so thoroughly unlikable and somehow makes us root for him at the right moments, feel for him at the right moment, want him to win at the right moment,yet turn against him when we realise who he really is. No other American actor could have done that - they are by nature too positive! In fairness, it's not just about Douglas, even though he does drive this film. Robert Duvall does provide some strong support with a character that is clich√©d. He takes the role of the retiring cop and lifts it above the level that it really is. And various other actors and actresses including Raymond J Barry, Rachel Ticotin and Barbara Hershey lift their roles to another level. One of the flaws of this film is that the supporting roles are perhaps too clich√©d at times, and could have down with more thought. Having said that, if more time had been spent on those characters, we'd never have seen Douglas literally tear up the screen. Another weakness is that at times the scenes and violence are almost cartoonish and over the top. But, again this is the films way of taking a very dark story and making it watchable and even enjoyable at times. This would have been a very hard film, and a very dark story had it not been for the almost dark humour that appears at times. Not perfect by any means, but this is the film for the average man who feels like the underdog. It also does have a bigger message than most Hollywood films do, which is always refreshing. 8/10. "},{"Title":"Falling Down","Date":"31 December 2013","Score":"","Genre":"Crime, Drama, Thriller","Review":" Falling Down is a smart, tense thriller, one that within a few minutes has you on the edge of your seat. From the very beginning, we are forced to live alongside William Foster (Michael Douglas) for a single day. One hot and sweaty summer, Foster abandons his car in the middle of a traffic jam and goes on an increasingly violent rampage to get his own back on society; all the while trying to make it very clear that he is not a vigilante; he just wants to get to his daughter's birthday party. It all comes together perfectly right before our eyes. So it all starts off tame, yet totally enthralling; we are shown the chaos of modern day life through the eyes of one man. William Foster strikes one as a regular, mild-mannered guy. Douglas plays him quietly, gently, capturing the mannerisms of an ordinary middle class man. But only mere minutes into the film, this relaxed fa√ßade is shelved and we are thrown into a shattering confrontation at a general store, where Foster explodes and releases his inner thoughts on society, behaviour and ethnicity. We see elements of Foster's normality throughout the film,but from act one onwards we don't look at him in quite the same way; in fact, we barely see a normal man at all. Although Falling Down is not an action movie, there is a firefight early on and once some angry Latino gangs get on Foster's trail, violence crops up quite often. It's not only gangs going after William Foster either; Sergeant Prendergast (played half-heartedly by Robert Duvall), on his last day before retirement and also quite fed-up with society, is quickly alerted of Foster's rampages and takes the case into his own hands. Before the intense stand-off in the finale, Foster runs into some trouble at a fast food joint, confronts a white supremacist surplus store owner, and launches an impressive attack on a group of lazy construction workers. The pacing throughout this tremendous movie is perfect, with the music keeping the tension palpable for the duration. Michael Douglas gives a spectacular performance from the get-go in both his quiet, emotional moments with his ex-wife and child, and his insane rampages as he becomes increasingly mentally unstable. Falling Down is taut, shocking and sometimes even darkly funny; the perfect mix of action, thrills and the ultimate social commentary.8/10 "},{"Title":"Rising Up","Date":"11 December 2013","Score":"","Genre":"Crime, Drama, Thriller","Review":" Joel Schumacher directed this compelling drama that stars Michael Douglas as William 'D-Fens' Foster, a recently laid-off defense factory worker, and most disgruntled, frustrated, and rebellious man who one day abandons his car during a heat-wave in a traffic jam and proceeds on a personal odyssey through the streets of Los Angeles, ostensibly to reunite with his ex-wife(played by Barbara Hershey) and young daughter, but along the way encounters a myriad of gang members, ungrateful foreigners, inconsiderate fast food restaurants, a confused Nazi, and callous golfers who test his patience and sanity. Robert Duvall plays investigating police detective Prendergast, who also has a troubled wife(played by Tuesday Weld) but has handled his life differently.

But Joel Schumacher's film is about more than petty revisionism, for it is a piece depicting a white man in a Western metropolis losing their minds amidst a place seemingly ravaged by foreign policy; multi-ethnical congregation and crooked economic thinking and of which has led him to be where he is as certain others, perhaps less entitled to what they've got, thrive. Alongside Mike Leigh's film Naked from the same year, Falling Down is compulsory viewing as a film depicting a series of vignettes and altercations between a lone, unhinged lead and those of whom he encounters as he trawls his way through a place you probably think you know through that outlet we call 'popular culture', but whose true face here strikes us as a lot less than what is pleasant. The approach, often limited to that of films from Africa; the Middle East and Latin America, allows the screenwriter to weave their protagonist down a series of alley ways encompassing the political feeling; the false economy and racial segregation apparent in of one of the most recognisable cities of the Western world. In short, it works an absolute treat. Schumacher places us into the mind-set of his lead during the opening sequence, a traffic jam on a busy freeway in sweltering L.A. conditions as canted angles and preoccupations with unpleasant, annoying things force us to view the world from a very specific standpoint. In there amongst the noise; the flies and the road works holding everybody up is Michael Douglas' character a perfectly nondescript guy, although whose image through popular culture since has rendered his image anything but ordinary, that sports a short haircut; glasses; a blank, white shirt and an innocuous black briefcase to go with an everyday build. The epitome of white, working class Europe and America who're burrowing away in their middle-age, we have our lead in William Foster. Cracking under the conditions, Foster ups and leaves his car stranded in its lane for the nether regions that greet the patron who so dares navigate that territory just to the sides of a motorway. His reply to one driver's perplexity at the situation reveals that he's going home, but he is going home to a family that's later revealed to have already been broken by him in the past. Some duality is established through Foster's foil for the film, Robert Duvall's police officer Martin Prendergast; an elderly law enforcer on the brink of retirement whose reaction to everything in that very same traffic jam is to merely curse and get on with it. Here is a man whose reaction is to chuckle at some graffiti on an overhead billboard more-so condemn it as an item synonymous with the collapse of society. It will come to pass that, like Foster, Prendergast too is just trying to get home; to get home after a long time spent doing what he does and to get home to a domestic set up poles apart from Foster's on top of his very different reaction to the opening hold up.The meat of the piece is Foster's stylised rampage through the streets, parks and turfs of Los Angeles; a place wherein one is nary too far away from a Latino punk, a homosexual, a white supremacist or a con artist who's ploy to do what they do in a busy public area in broad daylight with the minimum of respect is one of the more disturbing sequences in a film that's already featured vandalism and gun crime. One such sequence sees Foster, quite literally, dismantle Capitalism in its purest physical form when he takes a baseball bat to a store owned by an immigrant seeking the American dream as well as its supplies therein. This is on account of everything costing so much more than when Foster was a child. Later on, the collapse of education and the general fallout of the relationship children have with their elders is depicted in a scene when Foster recalls how referring to someone more advanced in life as sir is the cultural norm, a view that a pair of Latin American thugs do not share. Foster's encountering of inter-racial segregation; Capitalism run amok, as foreign aid does so additionally, and a complete loss of respect plaguing society as a whole fuels this strand of causality aggression; provocation and regression. Its culmination, on a 'bubbled' golf course, as those affluent enough to shroud everything out in spite of the fact most of them are probably responsible for it, would be a lot funnier if it didn't ring so painfully true. Set away from Douglas' episodic spree is Prendergast's piecing together of said thing, a relief if your politics do not sync up with that of Douglas' character's and certainly a strand with more of a backbone, from a classical film-making angle, if clues; progression and a general sense of unfolding narrative are the characteristics you use to define such a thing. Schumacher builds a wonderful atmosphere out of the little things, the notion that Prendergast is on the cusp of leaving his job; the idea that gunshot wounds are commonplace in his chosen career and the sense we get of how utterly devastated his wife would be should such a thing happen becomes more and more apparent thus aiding this coiled feeling about things. Foster's handiness with automatic weaponry and the fact Prendergast is essentially tracking this guy to bring him to justice one way or another is prominent. Say what you will about most of Schumacher's work, but Falling Down is wonderful.

Well, this man (played beautifully by M. Douglas) takes that to the next level. He's in his car in a still-standing line at a roadworks site. Suddenly he gets out of the car, and when a police officer yells at him what he thinks he's doing, he says simply 'I'm going home.'And he blasts the things that stand his way out of it with, of course, guns. You see, this is no office worker. This is a man who works secret projects for the U.S. army, so he has access to lots and lots of guns. Every time he sees something that angers him he begins to yell about how society has broken down, Meanwhile the police, lead by detective prendergast on his final workday before retirement, try to track him as he leaves a trail of murders and shooting-ups behind in the city. He is doing all that to get to his ex-wife and children. His ex-wife divorced him because one day he went crazy and beat her up, and so he was given police orders to stay at a distance of at least 100ft from her st all times. Prendergast really understands what this man is doing and why he's doing it. All this leads to an epic showdown at a pier, where he is ultimately shot by Prendergast, which is the end of the film.Conclusion Rent this movie and watch it. You will not be disappointed, Pinky-swear.

He's just like any other workingman where they have to put up with the crap they see; budget cuts, being fired or even like what I said in the beginning statement. He's fired from his job as a weapon maker for the military as his character made missiles, bombs, guns, etc. He's laid off from his job and all he wants to do is go see his ex-wife for his kid's birthday party. From the moment we see his character go insane and killing off people left and right, that's where the fun begins.Robert Duvall plays Detective Pendergrast, a good cop who always went by the law and never said a cuss word in his life (though his captain like profanity). It's his last day as a Los Angeles police officer before he retires in Arizona. If things couldn't get any worse, he hears about D-FNSE going on a rampage from shooting a liquor store, killing a bunch of gang members, holding a burger joint hostage, killing a racist military expert, blowing up a construction site, killing a rich golf member and the only response from most witnesses is that he's a white guy with a shirt and tie.There are many movies that I recall where it had these male losers who didn't do anything at all. Fast Times At Ridgemont High was the early movie of where teens went through different topics, except for Jeff Spicoil who didn't care about anything except for surfing; The Big Lebowski was a story about a man who didn't give a crap about anything except smoking grass; American Splendor showed the life of Harvey Pekar who wouldn't care if 9/11 happened, and was tired of living with the rules of trying to be like everybody else. Falling Down is different. It's a man who is tired of the system and of waiting for somebody to do something about it; D-FENS is just the type of guy we need.

All he wants to do is get home, unfortunately he's held back by his restraining order. Talk about bad luck. What will he do next, you never know but it's safe to assume that it will be incredibly bad-ass. The Whammy Burger scene is too awesome to put into words, and the same goes for the scene where he walks up to a golfer who tries to take him out with a ball. Which angries him tremendously. The scenes with the police inspector inspecting stuff are a little less interesting, but they work up to a truly brilliant climax, which is both witty and saddening at the same time.

He did an excellent job as the person some of us actually secretly wish we could model the indestructible anti-hero that's Mad as hell, and not going to take it anymore! One of the best aspects is that unlike some anti-heroes ('The Punisher') he didn't set out, nor wishes to be a vigilante. He was just a man who reached his limit awhile back and now can't hold it in anymore. He just, for lack of a better term, wants to go home. Synopsis Bill leaves his car in the hot sun/stopped traffic one morning and begins his journey home while along the way meets some interesting characters who, well, irk him and since Bill has passed his boiling point, he has nothing to lose and tells/shows them how he feels. Mostly he does it with extremely funny dialogue I loved. Meanwhile, soon-to-be retired desk-cop Prendergast is dealing with a million issues of his own (a very ill wife, a deceased daughter, retirement) and still, he's on the case of the strange white male with a white shirt, tie and baseball bat who's wrecking havoc in the LA county. It's too bad that, despite I believe strongly on the statements Bill makes (namely fast food, those awful gangsters and the grumpy old golfers) I can't really side with his methods. And besides, unfortunately, whether or not this movie was real, nothing will change. We would still always be neighbors to these jerks. This is one of my all-time favorite movies. Douglas was brilliant and for him alone and the extreme depth Douglas showed, the movie needs to be seen.

While we should have some sympathy for this guy who snaps under the frustrations and irritations of life does this excuse his actions? Some reviewers feel that Foster didn't really do anything wrong. On the contrary, his murdering of the neo-Nazi by shooting him in cold blood and his gloating over the elderly golf player dying of a heart attack verge on pure evil. One wonders whether he would have murdered his family then suicided if given the chance. The only good thing he did was to allow himself to be shot so that his daughter would get the insurance.

My favorite scene in the whole movie was the one in the fast food restaurant it was just something a lot of people can agree with and it was hysterical. The film basically show how the decay of society can drive some people mad, and the anti-hero just goes bonkers gradually even more as important things in his life get taken away. This film does show that there is something wrong with our society and corrupt which was the highlight of the film.

It's not particularly pleasant. Yet it sure is trenchant. Bill D-Fens Foster (Michael Douglas) is an American who plays by all the rules. But one summer day, he gets stuck in L.A. traffic. The longer he sits in his car, the more fed up he gets with the hassle, the noise, the stress. He abandons his car and starts walking.For the duration of the film, Foster walks and walks, and walks, first to a small grocery store where the owner wants too much money for a soft drink. Stressed-out Foster trashes the place, as a way of standing up for my rights, as a consumer. Continuing his journey through the urban jungle he encounters (1) two gang members, (2) a friendly but robotic manager of a fast food joint, (3) the Nazi owner of a leather goods store, (4) a street construction crew, and (5) a couple of wealthy golfers. In each encounter, our anti-hero vents his anger, his exasperation.We all feel like Foster at times. But most of us have built-in psychological brakes that prevent destructive behavior; Foster does not have those brakes; instead he explodes. Not only does the film explore the stress of urban life, it also makes the point that there's not a lot that separates those who are financially secure from those who are not.The film's themes are highly relevant to contemporary urban living. But the film has a major plotting problem. Too much time is spent on Detective Prendergast (Robert Duvall) and especially his wife, Amanda. And the police crew giving Prendergast his retirement party is extremely annoying. A lot of the scenes dealing with these ancillary characters could have been cut.Foster's wife, or ex-wife, Beth, is one character I detested. She refuses to let Bill see his little girl on the girl's birthday. That refusal inflames Bill, and rightly so. His wife (or ex-wife) is selfish and insensitive.The film's tone is not realistic. Yes, urban life is stressful. But it's not as melodramatic as the film would lead one to believe. So much of the acting and dialogue are overwrought. The Nazi store owner, played by Frederic Forrest, seriously overacts, for example.Falling Down has a lot to say about the stresses of contemporary American life. Yet, I found the film hard to watch, partly because of the poor plotting, and partly because the subject matter is not palatable.

Michael Douglas is OUTSTANDING in this role, with a very unpredictable personality. There are times when you compliment the guy for standing up for what he believes in, and while watching the same movie, you feel that he MUST pay the consequences for hurting, and in one case, killing a person.SPOILERS HERE Bill Foster, (played by Douglas) is trying to get home to his daughter's birthday party. Robert Duvall plays the cop on his last day of work before retirement trying to stop him. There are some supporting roles worth a mention, such as Tuesday Weld, who plays Duvall's emotionally unstable wife, made worse by a tragedy in their own family. Barbra Hershey, plays Douglas' ex-wife who is looking for protection from her violent husband.Watch for several good stand-out scenes, the best involving Douglas going berserk at a fast-food burger joint. Much of what happens when Douglas is on-screen is predictable. However, he acts out the role so well, it is really reminiscent of watching say Jack Nicholson go into a slow descending rage. (He would have been just as good if not BETTER in this role!) But maybe he wasn't considered because he's getting too old. However, Douglas is THAT good in this role. When he is on screen you can't take your eyes off of him.The problem is that when he is not on screen, the film loses momentum. While an honest effort by the minor characters, they just aren't strong enough. The investigation and questioning by Duvall, his co-workers, the interviewed witnesses, takes too long to get going. Meanwhile, the viewer is waiting for the action to go back to Douglas so that he can do his next crazy thing. There also isn't enough material for Duvall's unstable wife, or Douglas' worried wife to work with. But it's a double edged sword. Had they BEEN given stronger story lines in the script, we wouldn't have been able to see Douglas in several good scenes.Because of this dilemma, I don't know what would have made Falling Down better. My best guess would be the following indicated belowThere's just one or two little ingredients that are missing, which stop this film from being great. These are too many minor characters and not enough material for them to work with. However, this is still a highly recommended film and well worth seeing.

Of course it's a bit unrealistic but i am sure nearly everyone will spot a tiny smile on his own face when Michael Douglas gets even with the building workers for closing down the road for weeks without doing any repairs on it. But besides the main plot there is a subplot based around actor Robert Duvall. I don't want to say that he didn't do a good job, but I as a viewer just didn't care for him. I had to prevent myself from fast-forwarding through the scenes in which he played.

Is it really just because I must be no less crazy than he, as most would readily insist? Or, could it possibly be something much less typically simple (non-) minded than that, which is more popularly, normatively, thus alone unassailably reflected in what has happened, what we've all allowed to occur, to every one of us, and insist upon keeping that way? Perhaps it's the form, and not the content, of how he'd begun expressing himself? Well, then, maybe he should have just found a friend to talk to, or even a stranger on the street; one who would, no doubt, have sarcastically called him crazy, regardless of how calmly and sensibly he'd tried to share his feelings! In fact, far-too-many, if not most, instinctively interpret kindness as weakness and stupidity! About the only form of somebody's need to falsely or at least ignorantly but sincerely believe himself at all Christianly Compassionate, rather than much more predictably and viciously resentful, which he'd thereby have had even a small chance of encountering; would have undoubtedly assumed the conventionally and evasively falsifying expression of a suggestion that he see a psychiatrist, where the presupposition that he's the only one with the problem remains axiomatically supreme. At best, the psychiatrist might uncharacteristically concede, if he's sufficiently one-upped, that, while society itself unwittingly suffers from its own pseudo-collective form of psychosis, there's nothing anybody can do to change that, thus leaving the only realistically sane alternative that of adjusting to it, while antiseptically neutralizing the very reason why society itself could and even should consider changing, one real individual at a time, if not all of them, at once! . . . His wife was certainly not available, just as the film itself at least appears to presuppose that no account as to how the brutally-insensitive hostility in her attitude had come about needs to be offered, since the answer to that is allegedly right before the horrified eyes of the audience, which smugly assumes the way he's expressing himself to be nothing but the cause, rather than perhaps at least as decisively an effect of the fact that no other form of approach had ever made any constructive difference. In fact, try saying please, to the Devil, and his technique will often be to get your goat, so he can be the one to point the finger! The only thing which never self-vindicatingly comes into focus is the kind of man who just wants to see his daughter, or the kind of man whose reasons for feeling so dangerously perturbed should have been no less self-evidently and understandably revealing. Perhaps he should have made a movie about the problem, although it would have thereby been reduced to nothing but a form of contained and squared-away entertainment, infested with mere actors (as well as Circus Maximus spectators), who've learned nothing, but only want to be, as Nietzsche so cynically and accurately observed, well-paid, and glorified, in full (Matthew 61-6). Or, what if he'd tried to share his thoughts on a web site such as this, about a similar kind of film; only to have received a long string of negative votes, and even complaints to the web site masters about how he's not sticking to an appropriately relevant or artistically non-controversial critique of the film; from many-too-many who are offended due to their unwillingness to handle any deeper, more meaningfully relevant kind of truth, and whose demands that the comments be deleted would thereafter be instantaneously honored? . . . I was going to say that such people are typically reflective of Hitler, in their spontaneously instinctive inclination to insist that anything they don't like be totally censored; particularly if their feeling is prevalent enough to where they know their demand would thereby alone be self-evidently vindicated, no questions asked, as well as very undemocratically minus any respect for perhaps even the many who would have appreciated a chance to read such comments. But, then, on second thought, perhaps even Hitler was also if not even primarily reacting, in spirit, to the very kind of people who would have unhesitatingly reacted, in precisely his way, to still others, who would have reacted, in exactly the same way, to them, had any one of them, from either category, simply had the chance Hitler did to do so, coupled with what Scarface called the guts to be what you want to be, which alone most so very virtuously, timidly, domesticatedly, albeit no less brutally, uncompromisingly, in attitude, lack. I have no doubt that most would want my head, or at least my comments bigotedly deleted, for what I'm about to say, in the more constructive way that they'd thus quite hypocritically suggested the Columbine boys should rather have expressed themselves! Nevertheless, what I do believe is that there is a great deal of truth to the assertion that Hitler had been at least as much a reaction to Hitler as anything else (he had himself called it Fighting Terror with Terror!), and that this is at least as much the reason he's been so hatefully, hysterically demonized, from beneath all the indispensably good arguments against him behind which they conveniently hide from themselves! Even Bible Believers incoherently forget that, when Paul and Peter speak of all the powers that be having been Divinely-Ordained, Hitler must thereby have been meant, too, at least for the duration of his tenure, and for a much better reason than that he had simply come out of nowhere,  to disrupt an otherwise Christianly Harmonious situation! The biggest waste of all is that nobody's learned, even from Hitler! However, the next and last one will prove to be much more antithetical or diplomatically palatable than he had been, particularly in his most equally, morally unjustifiable folly!

He then continues on his trek but is harassed by two gang-bangers who cite him for 'trespassing' and 'loitering'. When these would-be toughs try to take his briefcase, D-FENS fights back, hitting the gang members with the bat and driving them off. Sgt. Pendergast (Duvall) is following D-FENS's progress after the store clerk is brought to him under the mistaken pretext that it is another robbery. Pendergast is about to retire and move to Arizona, but when he finds out about D-FENS he is determined to stop him. D-FENS subsequently runs into a homeless man who tries to trick him into giving him money, but D-FENS hands over his briefcase which has nothing except food in it, and walks away in annoyance. Soon after, the gang-bangers who D-FENS had driven off earlier come looking for him, and find him at a phone booth. They make a drive-by shooting trying to kill him, but miss and their car crashes. One gang member is killed outright; the second find D-FENS standing over him, an Uzi in hand, threatening him. As the gang member begs for his life, D-FENS shoots him in the leg & walks away, picking up the bag full of guns as he does. Pendergast soon finds out about it when a gang member's girlfriend is brought in for questioning about the drive-by. Meanwhile, D-FENS enters a fast-food restaurant, only to find out he cannot order breakfast as it is after 1130. He pulls out a submachine gun and sprays the roof with bullets, then decides to order. Yet he is again annoyed when the product he gets is incredibly small compared to the ad photo. However he walks out of the restaurant & carries on, where he sees a man on a street corner protesting outside a bank about being 'not economically viable'. D-FENS sees the man arrested by police, and as the man is driven away, he says to D-FENS 'Don't forget me'. D-FENS nods, as if he feels a connection, which he likely does. Carrying on to a surplus store, he finds out the owner is a neo-Nazi, who threatens D-FENS with arrest after D-FENS disagrees with him. D-FENS tricks the man and overpowers him, killing him with one of the guns from the bag, then leaving with a rocket launcher the man had shown him. After he tries to call his wife, a rude man at a phone booth berates him for taking too long. Angrily, D-FENS pulls the Uzi from his bag and sprays the phone booth with bullets. Pendergast, meanwhile, realizes that these incidents are connected and is determined to hunt down D-FENS. On a freeway, D-FENS discovers more obnoxious road workers and takes out their equipment with the rocket launcher. Soon, he reaches a golf course, where an unpleasant old golfer tries to run him off the course by hitting a golf ball at D-FENS. D-FENS angrily pulls a sawed-off shotgun from the bag, and the rude old man grabs his chest. After D-FENS sends their golf cart rolling into a water trap, D-FENS stands over the old man & taunts him, as his heart pills are on the cart that has rolled into the water. Venice police, meanwhile, have responded to his ex-wife's calls about D-FENS's threats, and Pendergast & his partner, Det. Sandra Torres (Ticotin) head for her home. But D-FENS is on his way there as well, and a dramatic showdown between D-FENS & Pendergast will ensue...This movie has some fine performances from Douglas & Duvall, but even more than that, in D-FENS, it gives us a character that many of us can sort of empathize with. Douglas's character is one who has felt the frustrations & setbacks of so many things that people in the 90's dealt with; corporate 'downsizing' or 'right-sizing'; crime; the excesses of near-absolute free enterprise; divorce & marital issues. Many of us think criminal thoughts; we just don't act criminal acts, as D-FENS does. Undoubtedly so many of us have imagined ourselves as a D-FENS kind of person.8/10 "},{"Title":"One for the downtrodden.","Date":"30 December 2005","Score":"","Genre":"Crime, Drama, Thriller","Review":" Falling Down Drama Ever have one of those days where you just must've woken up on the wrong side of the bed and every little thing just seems to irritate the hell outta you until you just can't handle it all anymore and pretty soon&#133; yah snap?And then, you feel really refreshed for a moment&#133; And then everything just gradually, somehow, incredibly&#133; gets worse?That's Falling Down. A Tale of Urban Reality. Michael Douglas stars as the guy that just can't take it anymore. But he doesn't just snap. He calmly goes berserk through Los Angeles. All he wants to do is see his little girl on her birthday. So he walks away from his car, leaving it stranded on a busy highway so he can meander through the city to go see his daughter. And along the way, he meets countless interesting jerks and pricks and gradually takes revenge on the world that has so thoroughly screwed him and left him broken. Robert Duvall plays the desk cop on his last day who's seeing connections between spots of random lunacy as they crop up in a straight line in the city. It's all uphill from there, right?Here's the breakdownThe Good--This is a rare film and one to be applauded for it's stark raving visualization of a broken-down middle-aged white man. In this day and age of rampant, raging political correctness, here we have a film following someone screwed by the system&#151;who isn't a minority. It lends to the idea that society itself has dealt the protagonist a mighty blow. Okay, to some people, this sounds stupid, I've met them. Oh the poor white man!! (sarcasm, followed by) Who gives a f*ck? Well, for one, white guys that have lived in a system that prides itself on helping everyone but heterosexual healthy white males&#151;the ones blamed for everyone else's misfortunes&#151;this is a film of pride and sorrow. It hits home. Down on your luck and it just gets worse and no one wants to fight for you&#151;the white man. Left to fend for yourself in a system increasingly against you&#151;the white man. No more luck and no way out. So, granted, this film has a small audience, but that doesn't lessen the impact of the story&#151;and that's my top spot here for The Good&#151;this film has some balls on it.--Within about five minutes, your eyes widen and you wonder just how far this film will go to show how on the end of his rope, Michael Douglas's character, known only as D-FENS is. The outburst he exhibits from being charged 85 cents for a can of pop gets the movie off to a great start&#151;one which helps hold attention.--Excellent acting through and through. Douglas hits all the right notes and buttons from agitation to confusion, he exhibits, not just traits growing in our modern, busy-as-hell yuppie white middle-aged males, but also a frustration that can be shared by most all people for the little things here and there that pick and bite at our stress tolerances.--Surprising, shocking, and funny scenes crop up throughout the film&#151;though they aren't ha ha funny so much as they are very entertaining. Just watch the scene in Whammy Burger and tell me that's not as funny as it is tense.--Michael Douglas and Robert Duvall are both top notch in their performances. We have quite a bit of depth in both of them and get to know them quite well. We're introduced to their minds and ways and the problems they've experiences which have dominated their lives and the different ways they've handled all that life has done to them.--Some great dialog, simply beautiful. No, the words aren't pretty, but the phrases really grab your attention&#151;and several are really quite amusing. What's that? Pills? You're pills are in the cart? Well what can I do? Now aren't you sorry you didn't let me pass through your golf course? And now you're gonna die wearing that stupid little hat.Didn't Hurt It, Didn't Help--The music and cinematography are about average, nothing overly special.--The desk cop out to solve one last mystery does feel kind of clich√©, however, Robert Duvall carries the character extremely well&#151;and is immensely likable. Both main characters are done so well that part of me rooted for one and part of me rooted for the other. Perhaps, in the end&#133; maybe they could get each other&#133;?The Bad--Like I said, this really feels like a film to grant some strength and pride to white guys as well as sympathize with them. I've personally had my own screwing over by the system, so this film still resonates with me. But a lot of people will just be annoyed by the message and tale.The Ugly--Some possible stereotyping going on here and there. Nothing major.--That Nazi is quite a fellow. Quite a slimy fellow.Memorable Scene--But I want to order breakfastI'm sorry, but we stopped serving breakfast a few minutes ago.Acting 9/10 Story 9/10 Atmosphere 8/10 Cinematography 6/10 Character Development 9/10 Special Effects/Make-up 9/10 (it's hard to do gunshots wrong, nothing major) Nudity/Sexuality 0/10 (nothing to note) Violence/Gore 6/10 (some violence, no gore) Dialogue 10/10 Music 6/10 Direction 9/10 Cheesiness 1/10 Crappiness 0/10 Overall 9/10I really enjoy this film, pretty much everything about it is entertaining and eye-catching.

In anger he turns to the streets with a arsenal of small arms and shoots everything up. The film is like something out of the newspaper (with the LAWS rocket scene being over the top). I know a guy who lost a promising career amid a flurry or is it fluery of corporate lies and religious lies. The man had to deal with a spectrum of emotions and moved on. Me. i get into the japanese train of thought. Suppose a man, a ronin is cast from the noblemans house and is left to fend for himself. Should he waste his tiem with a foolish violent attack on the nobleman and his clan? No. What he should do is side up (if possible) with the noblemans chief rival or rival house and plot the corporate or destruction of the noblemans house system from within. (Knowledge of the noblemans trade secret etc. could be useful to a enemy.) This is the best revenge there is as opposed to killing human beings, even those who have wronged you. i see the footage from columbine and I think...what a waste of life. the two students could have amounted to something in life and gotten married stated a computer business and instead they murdered a bunch of their classmen in a wall of bullets. Flooishness many times comes from the barrel of a gun. I do not live by this creed. Strategy in life even when we are down can propell us to greaer things after we have fallen like LUCIFER. (Even when we have not deserved it.) This film portrays the number one american response to loss of career and estee REVENGE WITH A GUN. Instead of plotting to kill a person who has wronged us, why not plot a new course for our lives. This film shows the downside. Something not mentioned in the film, the downside of killing people is jail time with two other inmates in a cell who want to make love to your butt. Something to think about. The wise man moves on and uses strategy (in business) to seek retribution. Who knows ten years from now a jilted employee could stage a hostile takeover of the company that screwed him by having joined a rival firm. (without murder and hurting people.)

To sum it up very quickly  Michael Douglas is a divorced, working stiff, who is fed up with the way our society runs.  He then heads through the city, using all necessary means to make it home.What makes this movie so enjoyable is how Douglas' character (Bill Foster) deals with his frustration.  As we see him tear his way through the neigbourhood, smashing up grocery stores who over-charge him or dishing it right back to street punks who think they own the city, you can't help but grin with envy.  We've all shared his problems, like ordering the perfect looking burger and winding up with a squashed mess. The difference is that we all just learn to lump it, whereas Foster unleashes a outburst straight out of our most raged-filled fantasies.The film as a whole does not glorify violence.  It is not so much an action movie, as it is a character study of two characters, played by Douglas and the always credible Robert Duval.Falling Down is sucessful and enjoyable because of a high action element mixed with a well thought out script.

We're supposed to live in a world that, thanks to technology, is supposed to be less stressful and more hassle-free.  Yet, tho we all get annoyed and angered by so many ridiculous things in life, most of us don't start shooting up places to get a sort of revenge.  Douglas plays a recently sacked defense contractor who made a career of building weapons used to destory and kill.  While driving home in heavy traffic, he finds he can't take it anymore.  He is thru with the noise, the traffic, the crying babies, the sirens, the thousands upon thousands of people, the smog, anything and everything under the sun is the target of his hatred. He leaves his car in traffic and starts to walk home.  It is his daughter's birthday, but he's not on good terms with his ex wife, and he's really not supposed to be able to his daughter.  The film is a very intersting look into the man's journey to see his daughter, and the various annoyances he comes across on his way there.     There are many themes in the film.  From how ridiculous some things in our society have become, to racism and bigotry.  Douglas runs into it all...all within a few hours time.  You have Duvall who plays the cop who ultimately ends the madness, and he does a great job.  I liked his character.  He is somewhat weak, but weak only because he loves his wife, and probably doesn't think he could be any stronger than he is.  He's a good man, you can tell, and he comes off very nicely in this movie.  Douglas' character is like a lot of people, minus the fact that he's sort of insane.  We all deal with a lot of the stuff he deals with in the movie, and we sometimes find the world unfair and unjust.  We would all probably like to do something about it now and then, but we don't usually act on it.  Douglas has been pushed so far, he has no choice but to step over the edge and do whatever he wants.  He doesn't hold back at all in the movie.  The story is well written, and it's entertaining throughout.  No lagging in the story, pace is really good, and there aren't a lot of parts you sit thru waiting for something more exciting.  The film would lie somewhere in the action genre, but there's comedy, and a deeper story underlying everything, in that he loves the family he once had, and probably wishes he hadn't screwed up and lost it.  This is a great film, and it is shot beautifully in various parts of Los Angeles.  I would completely recommend this movie.  It is entertaining while making you think of certain topics you wouldn't normally look at in this particular way.  10/10  "},{"Title":"The king of the urban jungle","Date":"11 January 2001","Score":"","Genre":"Crime, Drama, Thriller","Review":"  ** May contain spoilers **This film has to rank among my favourite Top 10.

It gave a brave commentary on how life is in the urban jungle and showed what could happen if someone had enough with all that was wrong, and then set it straight. To be fair though, he didn't actually intend to go around killing people and generally causing chaos, it found him. I think the most memorable image from this film was when 'D-Fens' had shot the latino thug, picked up the bag of assorted firearms, and proceeded to walk towards the crowd. The music in the background gave the impression he was a vigilante superhero. My only concern with this film was the stupid comedic set-pieces ie the boy telling him how to operate a bazooka, and then him firing the rocket down the manhole.All in all, after having seen this film twice, it has done enough to remain as one of my favourites.8 marks out of 10 "},{"Title":"the movie didnt fall down","Date":"9 January 2001","Score":"","Genre":"Crime, Drama, Thriller","Review":"  This was a good movie because there was some humor to.

During the course of the movies his weapons get bigger, but this is all an impotent man has left.  His wife hates him, the world ignores him - the man is theoretically impotent to do anything about the situation until he he starts asserting his masculinity with heavy duty weapons. Compare him with Predergast another impotent man, whose dominating wife has ruined his career and made him into a joke - but he loves he non the less - he too is impotent, only able to use his weapon when he finally breaks off the shackles of his overbearing partner.

Michael Douglas plays William Foster, a k a D-Fens (his license plate), a defense contract employee who loses it in a traffic jam on his way to work. He just abandons his car and calls out, I'm going home. He proceeds to travel through L.A., encountering what he feels is gross injustice and unfairness, and responding as feels necessary (usually with guns). Robert Duvall plays a cop on the last day before his retirement who hears of D-Fens' rampage. There's a not-quite-solid sub-plot about Duvall and his whiny wife.The movie is pretty well-acted. Michael Douglas is very good as D-Fens. Robert Duvall also does well, but his character lacks depth. All the other performances are at least decent or better, but nothing really stand-out. The dialogue is pretty good. Most of D-Fens' exchanges with people he doesn't like are pretty funny and on-target.My problem with movie is that most of the stuff D-Fens gets so angry about isn't that bad. D-Fens himself is certainly better off than many who have a much better claim to righteous anger than he does. That would be okay, except the movie shines a much too favorable light on D-Fens. When he trashes a convenience store because they wouldn't make change and charged 85 cents for a soda, D-Fens claims he's protecting his rights as a consumer, and the movie doesn't present anything to you to indicate that he is morally wrong. Do you really think a Korean guy who owns a convenience store in South Central L.A. is living it up in some mansion because he charges 85 cents for a can of Coke? His vengeance becomes more pointed and hateful as the movie progresses, and he's still portrayed as some kind of savior of the common man. Truthfully, the only people in the movie who got what they deserved were the gang in the car crash and the Nazi. And D-Fens wasn't even responsible for the car crash.D-Fens sees a lot of society's problems quite clearly. A lot of everyday crud we take for granted really seems ridiculous to him, and it is. This is really apparent in his often witty evaluations of each problem. But his responses to these are totally out of proportion. I don't think the director, Joel Schumacher, makes this clear enough. He makes D-Fens into a working-class hero, along the lines of Peter Gibbons of Office Space. (I know Falling Down came before Office Space.)Anyway, Falling Down is decent, pretty funny, worth seeing. Especially because it will redeem Joel Schumacher to a great many people who consider him a totally worthless human being because of Batman and Robin.6/10 "},{"Title":"Perfect.","Date":"9 November 2000","Score":"","Genre":"Crime, Drama, Thriller","Review":"  When picking my favorite movies, I use two things with which to judge  how well it was made, and how much it hit me personally.

He soon enough begins lashing out at these unjustly hassles in unfriendly and sometimes psychotic ways.

Lashing out violently at what he feels are injustices done to everyday people, he leaves a trail of anger across L.A. while walking across the city to see his estranged daughter on her birthday.Michael Douglas offers up a riveting performance as William Foster, an unemployed defense industry worker (he makes missiles he later tells us) who becomes known as D-FENS due to a chance encounter with LA Detective Prendergast (Robert Duvall) on a jammed expressway before the rampage begins.  Foster is divorced, estranged from his ex-wife Beth and daughter Adele because of a restraining order and hasn't paid child support in months.  This, coupled with Adele's birthday, his unemployment and living at home with his mother build up stress to levels where he snaps when needing change for a phone call to his daughter.  Douglas offers up a brilliant glimpse into the mind of a man who's world has crumbled around him and lets his temper overrule his better judgement.  The anger felt real and conversations with Beth are incredibly creepy.Robert Duvall plays Detective Prendergast. On his way to his final day with the police force, he becomes stuck in a traffic jam made worse by an abandoned car.  The plate reads D-FENS and another motorist tells Prendergast the guy left it and said he was going home.  He thinks little of the information until reports of a white man in a shirt and tie terrorizing Korean grocers, hispanic gang members, pay phones, and white country club snobs begin coming in.  Putting one and one together he begins to track the suspect and finally figures it all out.

Divorcing him because of his firey temper and fears he may one day become violent towards her or their child Adele (Joey Hope Singer) he begins calling her saying he's coming home for Adele's birthday.  Calls to the police first get a good response, then a second call results in an uncaring response by of all things a woman officer.  Beth doesn't offer up much as a character except to serve as the destination of Bill's journey.Tuesday Weld as the most irriating character in this film as Amanda Prendergast, the wife of the detective.  Her reaction to the change of life as well as her insecurities following the SIDS death of their two year old daughter cause her to be irrational and moody.  Not sure why she was here, but I could have lived without the character.Falling Down delivers a powerful, violent statement that anger and rage can manifest itself in many forms for many reasons, regardless of socio-economic status.

Three words synonymous with the magnificence that is Joel Schumacher's Falling Down. Schumacher's captivating cinematography is once again displayed at its finest in what is, arguably, one of the most shocking films of the modern era. Michael Douglas heads an the cast as an unemployed single father rushing to get home for his daughters birthday. In the midst of a large traffic hold up on one of the hottest days in history, he steps out of his car and crosses the road walking towards the other side of town. Thus beginning the countdown to his inevitable self destruction. Caught between everyday people and situations, he fails to control the pressures placed on him with the absence of his personal and professional life. His painful existence soon gets the better of him as modern day society feels the wrath of one man pushed too far. Not too far behind Douglas is Robert DuVall, a veteran cop on his last day on the job, trying to track him down and put an end to the torment. The script has been  beautifully cast and the acting is simply stunning as Douglas and DuVall clash head to head, one not knowing he is being pursued and the latter not knowing who he is after. Schumacher's direction is superb capturing all the emotion and fear with unsurpassed realism. Watching Falling Down once is simply not enough. Mind you those with sensitive ears will want to keep the volume to a minimum as profanity rocks the screen throughout, however it does, it most cases add to the tense atmosphere that is generated continuously throughout the film. Overall Falling Down is a disturbing look at 20th Century society and the life of an ordinary man driven beyond the limits of sanity. It is a chilling portrayal of a single life painstakingly pushed towards self-destruction, which conveys only one message - every man has his breaking point.

Already divorced from his wife and made an example of by the judge who presided over his divorce, D-Fens suffers an emotional breakdown while in a traffic jam and begins his rampage through LA on a direct course for Venice Beach, to see his daughter on her birthday.The film conveys some disturbing memories form those times. Cold corporate America, traffic jams from hell, a pervasive sense of despair prevalent through society.....But it does it's best public service when it shows what can happen to someone when they become isolated in a crowded city and cut off from the things they love. This doesn't justify D-Fens's behavior. In the end he turned out to be a mentally disturbed individual who couldn't obey the law through reason.

Look what he did in Batman Returns by making the Batsuit look like car rugs sewn together. Not to completely chastise him, he can be a really good director if he wanted to, but his failures seem to get the best of him and catches him off guard. Falling Down had tons of potential to captivate its audience as an eye-catching drama with plenty of commentary for good measure. And it succeeds in that spectrum thanks mostly to Schumacher, but with the help of the always impressive Michael Douglas during the first two-thirds of this movie. Douglas' perspective stands true to today's economy that even the rising price of a can of soda can raise angst among society as a whole. His frustration on the golf course represents shows how much he sympathizes the lower-class people in society. Up until, Falling Down have we ever seen Douglas annihilate a phone booth and that's when the movie bone's the fish. By shooting stuff for no real purpose is when we discover the film has lost its spunk.And so, as Douglas rants about the negativity of society, these comments become very random or sever the viewer's minds with it obviousness. Going back to the golf course scene, this would've been the best scene in the movie had Schumacher prevented Douglas from making a mockery of himself with unnecessary preachy diatribes. Ever since special effects came into prominence in movies, Hollywood has never mastered the skills of subtlety. Every problem in movies can be resolved with just a large dose of violence and hostility. It's as if they think the audience will buy into it. Like we're all a bunch of idiots. And so I say that Falling Down is strong in entertainment value and a film that anyone can enjoy. The Achilles Heel in this movie is that the ending didn't live up to its promise from its outstanding beginning. Too bad because as long as Schumacher is at the helm, he'll continue to make movies that builds on momentum with a disappointing outcome in the end.

I think calling it clich√© is shortsighted any more than calling than calling Iron Man clich√©. In terms of the movie, there are good guys and there are bad guys. The bad guys are the self-centered, thoughtless people who drift through life being rude and inconsiderate to strangers and the people around them. The good guys are the ones who care about life and other people. The movie makes no qualms about clearly defining who's who.Its not supposed to be complicated. The other people in the movie are strangers in the perspective of the anti-hero, played by Michael Douglas (William Foster) and the movie is set in a camera narrative centering around his world and secondarily to Robert Duvall's character (Detective Prendergast). The minor characters are underdeveloped to not distract attention from the central figures in the movie, both troubled, both angry and frustrated, but who deal with their issues differently. Detective Prendergast, if he has a first name doesn't ever have it mentioned by his family or friends in the context of the movie. He is referred to a Prendergast, but there is some amount of character development centering around him. This is one of Robert Duvall's finest modern performances. He is sympathetic, brave, heroic and troubled by his life as a police officer and his wife's emotional problems. It would be simplistic, although not incorrect to call Detective Prendergast the hero of the movie, although the movie centers more around Bill Foster. Michael Douglas' portrayal of Foster is complicated. He is a nice man, concerned, thoughtful, but possessing a terrifying temper that is his Achilles' Heel.The minor characters are merely a backdrop. There are nice guys and bad guys in most every situation, whether the fast food restaurant shooting, or the police officers who show up to try and help Barbara Hershey (Beth Trevino, the ex-wife of Bill Foster). Some of them are overly offensive and obnoxious, where some are overly sweet and caring. This is, again, from the perspective of the violent, intelligent and angry Bill Foster who sees things as good and bad, polarized completely. He doesn't see subtleties in people, he only sees what his life has conditioned him to see, he reaches his breaking point and reacts with great volatility being kind and thoughtful one minute and angry and explosive the next. Some moments bring him back to his socialized facade of civility only to lose them once again. A man lost in the conflict between his morality, his anger, the people around him and the pain of a world he lives in that violates his preconceived ideas.This movie has a great deal of conflict and paradox, which is the point, I think. Its not supposed to be clear what happens or even what force motivates Bill Foster. Enjoy it. Its a great movie and has real rewatchability.

Although Bill has a lot of screen time the film doesn't really explore his character with much depth. The idea seems to be that he has become disillusioned with modern society; nearly every person he meets is rude and deliberately unkind. This might have been more interesting if there was a possibility it might signify a skewed narrative subjectivity but any such ambiguity is wiped out by the subplot with Detective Pendergrast, a police officer one day away from retirement who not only happens to be in a uniquely perfect position physically and mentally to track and catch Bill but also has his own encounters with unnaturally hateful people.For the most part the film focuses on Bill's nightmarish encounters with modern society. Basically, the film sets up some easy targets such as uncooperative retail workers, lazy road crews, and violent gang members and barely manages to knock them down with its unconvincing criticisms. The problem here is not just that these ancillary characters are cartoonishly exaggerated; Bill's character isn't normal enough to be our guide through an environment that seems to be created to seem naturally hostile. His main character trait seems to be anger and he often appears to be seeking conflict as his encounters on his journey to his daughter's birthday party at his old house become increasingly violent and the body count steadily increases.On the upside Robert Duvall does an amazing job with his role of Detective Pendergrast, the character that gradually displaces Bill as the narrative completes its trajectory. The performance of Michael Douglass as Bill is somewhat less convincing but not necessarily bad. Another positive here is that this film isn't so serious that it becomes depressingly misanthropic, in fact it's the sort of work that has comedic moments that would likely seem more pronounced (and effective) on a second viewing. The best that can be said about Joel Schumacher's direction is that it only calls attention to itself a few times; this isn't a film with a particularly strong aesthetic. Still, a rapidly edited montage early on was intriguing enough to make up for the frequently heavy handed music cues. "},{"Title":"Shocking, thrilling and generally quite frightening.

Michael Douglas gives a really strong performance as the lead, but I think that the star of the show is Schumacher. His direction is really something. All the way through you have the feeling that something really bad is about to happen, and when bad stuff is happening you get the feeling it's about to get worse. The tension is incredible. Despite the setting in the streets of L.A. Schumacher still makes you feel extremely claustrophobic, like you can't get away. It's the perfect length and the plot moves along at a decent pace. I can overlook the slightly predictable ending because the film obviously has a lot to say socially. It is essentially a psychological analysis of an everyday man who has snapped under the pressures of society. Other social outcasts are also featured, though in different ways- young gangsters, victims of economic downturn, and even one Nazi. Despite all this I still managed to laugh at times, and this does well to cover up what could have been a really nasty film and made it more enjoyable to watch. "},{"Title":"Peace Dividend","Date":"18 April 2010","Score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Crime, Drama, Thriller","Review":" During his heyday in the eighties and early nineties, Michael Douglas seemed to specialise in what might be regarded as issue movies- films which dealt with some particularly controversial or sensational social issue. Thus The Star Chamber dealt with vigilantism, Wall Street with white-collar crime and corruption, Fatal Attraction with stalking and Disclosure with sexual harassment. Falling Down, perhaps Douglas's most controversial film, can be described as a super-issue movie as it manages to package a number of social issues in one.The film is set in the course of a single hot summer's day in Los Angeles. Early in the morning, with the temperature already rising, a man abandons his car in a traffic jam and sets out to walk across the city. In the course of the film we learn that his name is William Foster, that he is in his late thirties and that he lives with his elderly mother. He was at one time employed as a draughtsman in the defence industry, but was made redundant about a month earlier. He is divorced from his former wife Beth, by whom he has a daughter, Adele. The purpose of his cross-city journey is to see Adele on her birthday.Along the way, Foster is involved in a series of bizarre incidents. There is not space to describe them all here, but they mostly involved him reacting with increasing levels of violence to various provocations, some of them trivial, from those he encounters. The first such incident comes, for example, when he goes into a Korean-owned grocery shop to get change for a telephone call and ends up smashing the place up in protest against the owner's high prices and his surly and uncooperative attitude. Foster's behaviour brings him to the attention of the police, and Martin Prendergast, an officer on the eve of his retirement, takes on the task of tracking him down.The film was released in 1993 but was filmed the previous year, towards the end of the presidency of George Bush senior, and captures the feeling of disillusionment which afflicted America surprisingly soon after the end of the Cold War and victory in the first Gulf War. After the fall of the Berlin Wall people began to talk of a peace dividend, as it seemed that the money once used for expensive defence projects could now be diverted to more socially constructive purposes, but the early nineties were to turn out to be a period of economic recession, the leading reason for Bush's defeat by Clinton in the presidential election. (It's the economy, stupid!) For former defence workers like Foster, who had helped defend America against Communism, there was to be no peace dividend, only unemployment.Besides losing his job, Foster has another major grievance. His divorce was evidently a bitter one, and Beth has obtained a restraining order against him, even though she admits he has never used or threatened violence against her. Her aim seems to be to cut him not only out of her life but out of Adele's life as well. When Foster eventually reaches her house, Beth is horrified, but the little girl is overjoyed.This is probably Michael Douglas's best film, better even than Wall Street. In many of his films, Douglas plays tough, self-confident characters (the monstrous Gordon Gekko in Wall Street being a good example), but here he plays the archetypal put-upon Mr Average in a performance which expresses not only anger but also pain and sadness. Rather surprisingly, Douglas was not Oscar-nominated for this role; indeed, the Academy ignored the film altogether, possibly regarding it as too controversial. He also received excellent support from Robert Duvall as the quiet, patient Prendergast, Frederic Forrest as a creepy Neo-Nazi extremist and Tuesday Weld as the difficult Mrs Prendergast.A lot of comments on the film centre upon which of the two main characters we sympathise with. At first sight the answer seems obvious. Foster commits several criminal offences, some of them serious, in the course of his journey. Prendergast, despite his own frustrations- he is unhappily married to a neurotic wife and is unpopular with many of his colleagues- is a model citizen and professional who stoically and patiently goes about his duty of enforcing the law. Some have seen Foster as a dangerous right-wing vigilante, and there is some evidence to support this. His behaviour towards the Korean shopkeeper, for example, does suggest racist attitudes on his part.Yet the film is rather more complex than a simple case of right versus wrong. The title, taken from the nursery rhyme London Bridge is Falling Down, can be seen as referring to either Foster's mental collapse or to the state of American society. Foster perceives the flaws and injustices of that society- unemployment, crime, poverty, abuse of power, extremism- and, in his crazed way, decides to do something about them. His actions may be extreme, but the frustrations which lead to those actions are something shared by many American citizens. It should be noted that not all his concerns are those of the political Right- the one person he actually kills (in self-defence) is the Neo-Nazi.In the words of Peter Finch's character in Network, Foster is mad as hell and he's not going to take it any more. As in Network it is a man on the verge of madness who can see more clearly than the sane. Prendergast's peaceful acceptance of misfortune can be seen either as admirable stoicism or as the spineless conformism of the little man who, by rights, should be mad as hell but who just goes on taking it. 8/10 "},{"Title":"One of the best thrillers of the 90's","Date":"16 April 2010","Score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Crime, Drama, Thriller","Review":" This movie I saw long ago when I was a boy and I decided to look at it again after many years because we stayed in the memory yet.

However, he does not hesitate, and his goal of leaving the victims in its path.This film is a critique of society, racism, nationalism, work, etc. incorrectness.

In it, he plays a mentally unstable everyman who cracks while stuck in a traffic jam on a blazing hot summer's day in L.A. He abandons his car and sets off on a journey across the city to see his ex-wife and daughter on the day of the little girl's birthday. Douglas is simply outstanding in this role. His character is a complex one. While he is clearly a dangerous man, who is a definite danger to his wife and daughter, we also feel some empathy with him in his odyssey across the city. His journey is essentially a string of encounters with, for the most part, very unsympathetic people &#x96; a greedy shop-owner, a couple of gangsters, a Nazi, an obnoxious man outside a phone booth, a scrounger, a snobbish golfer, a fast-food manager, idle road-workers. Because he has gone over the edge he has no problem with giving these characters a piece of his mind and resorts to violence when required too. These encounters are often blackly comic with Douglas in his element delivering his brand of justice. Although you know he is going about things in a completely over-the-top way it's hard not to cheer him on.Falling Down reminded me a bit of the 1968 Burt Lancaster movie The Swimmer, where a man travels home by swimming through all of his neighbours pools. Both films share the idea of mentally troubled men with terrible home lives travelling home-wards via a succession of encounters, although in the case of Falling Down we are aware from the outset that Michael Douglas has a screw loose. This also has crime-thriller elements too but it shares the earlier film's complex central character. We never really know what Douglas did in order for his marriage to end but we are given various clues as to his instability and potential for violence. He is a fascinating central character.Able support is given by Robert Duvall as a police officer who is in some ways a mirror image of Douglas; an opposite with similarities. While he shares the protagonists problematic home-life and both men are soon to be out of work &#x96; although in Duvall's case it's his own choice &#x96; as a man his problems stem from opposite characteristics, where Douglas is too volatile, Duvall is too placid. They make for a great pair of central characters to hang the movie on. The other notable presence in the film is Frederic Forrest as the Nazi shopkeeper. You won't forget that character in a hurry; he is an extremely well-observed creation brilliantly played by Forrest.This is a great film that is paced excellently. The balance of thrills and drama is very well handled too. It's no ordinary crime-thriller though as it doesn't always give easy answers to where our sympathies should lie. It's often very funny too. Definitely recommended.

Made unemployed from his job at a defence contractor and separated from his wife and daughter, he is stuck, stuck in traffic, stuck in his mother's house, stuck in an America that doesn't care for the average Joe, stuck in a mindset that cannot cope with the outside world. He decides on the hottest day of the year to leave it all behind and just get to his daughter's birthday party, but due to the people he meets this day he is just not gonna make it, as he decides to be a champion of the people and take on the very people who make are lives so unbearable for the rest of us.This film is one of those that is both good but frustrating as their is so much to like in it, from his handling of the common thugs who think that their violence makes them something special, to burger joints who present a picture of their burgers that is like some kind of Utopion vision when the reality is very often squidgy and unsatisfying and finally the bitter old men in Rupert Bear pants and tea cosy hats who walk round their golf courses hating everyone and everything, in spite of owning most of it.All of this is great and the sparring that D-Fens does throughout the film with Detective Pendergrast is very entertaining as he contends with similar problems to D-Fens but handles them all a hell of a lot better, the direction is great and tells the story really well, but the big problem with the film is the way that it cops out by making D-Fens a man with Psychotic tendencies before the story starts as we see in earlier scenes. As this is a Hollywood film it can't be an average man having a breakdown it has to be someone with mental issues already and that is what annoys. This could have been a better film if we felt that we were D-Fens but these issues remove him from us and dilutes the impact that it could have.That said it is still a good watch 8 out of 10 "},{"Title":"What Price The American Dream?","Date":"23 July 2006","Score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Crime, Drama, Thriller","Review":" America, land of opportunity, a place where all men are equal under god. All well and good, but in this film Joel Schumacher gives us a long hard look at the underbelly of American society, and the view isn't nice.In a society so in love with it's cars it has grid locked itself we encounter William 'D-Fens' Foster (Michael Douglas), a man who's American dream has been shattered. Estranged from his family, jobless and cruising for a nervous breakdown a former hero and a man who has worked (in the words of his on screen mother) 'Designing weapons to keep us safe from the communists', hits breaking point, snaps and sets out on a journey through the dark underbelly of capitalist society in an attempt to a home that for him no longer exists.We see a society where small business can vastly inflate their prices in the name of profit, where corporate food franchises sacrifice customer service and quality of produce on the alter of a branded image and false smiles. A society where racism and homophobia are allowed to flourish in the name of free speech and gangs are prepared to massacre in the name honour to protect a few acres of wasteland whilst the rich spend time and resources playing golf and protecting their property with barbed wire in an effort to keep the underclass out of sight nd out of mind.Through this mess stalks Douglas, asking the awkward questions, dealing the roughest form of justice and fighting just to survive in the sea of capitalist excess.Counterpoint this with Robert Duvall as Prenderghast, a mild mannered cop on his last day on the job. Here is a man for whom the American dream has worked. He loves his menopausal wife, likes his job and is looking to retire to Arizona his life's work well done. Prenderghast is the polar opposite of Foster, he likes to talk (in the film he fires one shot compared to hundreds of rounds Foster fires off) and does hes damnedest to keep the American dream intact for everyone.Don't get me wrong, this film is not anti-American, or anti-capitalist or anti-western, but it does ask some pointed questions and intelligently leaves the viewer to give his own answers. Add in the fact that is film is very well made, with some superb pacey editing, and some wonderfully claustrophobic atmospherics and two fine performances from Douglas and Duvall and you have a true gem of modern cinema that stands up to repeated viewings.

Stuck in a monumental traffic jam, D-FENS angrily abandons his car and begins walking to his destination his ex-wife's home, to give his little girl a birthday gift.Along the way, he smashes up a Korean shopowner's store, stands up to gang members in a style we mere mortals have only dreamed, kills a Nazi, shoots up a phone booth and terrorizes employees and patrons at a fast-food restaurant. His ex-wife, played by Barbara Hershey, who knows he is coming over despite a restraining order, tells a cop she wants police protection. While he has never before become violent, he has a horrendous temper and she knows he might be capable of far worse. Still, in response to the cop's query (who at least knows enough to ask), she says he rarely drinks and doesn't use drugs. Yet, as with Anna Ayala, crazy, out-of-control behaviors are inexplicable unless we assume alcohol or other drug addiction.One reviewer claims that the point of the movie is to make a statement about society and that we should stand up for ourselves, albeit in more constructive and non-violent ways. And while we should, only an alcoholic is likely to go over the top the way D-FENS does, even though he is mostly reacting to behavioral manifestations of addiction in others (for example, the gang members, almost 100% of whom are substance addicts of one stripe or another). While healthy people may harbor fantasies of doing crazy things in response to idiotic rules and the rude behaviors of others, the neo-cortex, the human part of the brain responsible for restraining the impulses of the lower brain centers, usually prevents them from being acted out. This is not the case for alcoholics, whose damaged neo-cortex exercises far more limited restraint, a differential biochemistry discussed at length in my book, Myths and Realities of Alcoholism Removing the Stigma of Society's Most Destructive Disease. Another reviewer blames the recession that resulted in his layoff (the early '90s was an era of massive layoffs in the defense industry, to which D-FENS had devoted his life), but a layoff alone cannot account for insanity. While some may ask whether the fault is his for allowing himself to be driven over the edge or society's for pushing him there, addictionologists know that the odds of unrestrained violence are remote without damage to the frontal lobes of the brain, the most common cause of which is alcoholism.In my first of four books on the subject of alcohol and other-drug addiction, Drunks, Drugs & Debits How to Recognize Addicts and Avoid Financial Abuse, I discuss another dark comedy, War of the Roses. This would have been one of the greatest alcoholic movies ever if it had portrayed either main character (one of whom happens to be played by Michael Douglas) as drinking heavily. While recovering addicts know that the movie has addiction written all over it, most non-addicts think it's just about a psychotic couple whose love inexplicably turns to hatred over the course of a 17-year marriage. Similarly, Falling Down portrays a man with behavioral indications of an out-of-control limbic system (the pre-human, emotional brain), the normal cause of which is alcoholism. If we assume he hid his addiction well (as many do, even from their spouses), the movie makes sense. Still, it's a good movie, combining an appeal to our visceral emotions with some very amusing scenes and, not least, Robert Duvall in a wonderful role as the endearing Detective Prendergast as the only law enforcer able to put two and two together.

It is a spectacular study of the American Dream going horribly wrong. I'm quite sure Joel Schumacher was trying to make a serious social comment with this film. Somewhere along the line though, that comment gets lost. Any sympathy we might have for the D-FENS character is slowly stripped away until you actually want to see him killed by the end of the movie. I believe this was a mistake. Schumacher's social comment could have been more forcibly made had some good come from D-FENS'S campaign of righteous chaos. Most of the people he harms are pretty awful anyway.Michael Douglas plays the part of D-FENS superbly. One wonders why he hasn't taken on similar roles rather than the catalogue of aging womanizers he usually plays. Despite his flawless performance though, I kept wondering what Di Nero would have brought to the role.The other element that lets this movie down is Robert Duvall's stereotypical retiring cop. Duvall plays the role well. But that whole plot line introduces an element of cheesiness that is hopelessly out of place in what should have been a serious social drama. If you've not seen Falling Down then its well worth watching. But for me, it will always be the movie that missed a chance to be another Taxi Driver or Rebel Without a Cause.

It is a potentially cathartic rebuff to all the little unredressed wrongs that pile up on you in the course of a lifetime. But the film is a less cerebral 'Network', and the character's walk across town is less rhetorical than a newsman preaching from a bully media pulpit every night, bellowing I'm mad as hell, and I'm not going to take it any more and encouraging others to question the system. I think it's for this reason -- that the film takes a small-view angry caveman with club approach to a world that must be rebutted in articulate and rational (and large) terms -- that Falling Down sputters out for me part way through. For a film about a guy that everyone in the audience supposedly identifies with as he loses it, Falling Down shows terrible judgment in having the cops shadow the Douglas character all along the way, waiting for just the right minute to spring in, commenting passively on his every move from a distance. This will likely put a damper on this film for you. I mean, as they depict it, the poor guy never really had a chance to get away with anything.But ultimately, taking the makers at their ambition, which is to rip the lid off conformity and renounce taking it, Falling Down fails. It isn't uncorked and crazy enough, as it would be were Falling Down a low budget exploitation film. The execution of the concept envisioned by the makers needs a revving up in several departments. It seems strangely passive, for what it is, and oblique; when it's all over, you don't really know what to feel. The rampage the film promises seems to end before it begins. The fact that Douglas is not exactly a sympathetic actor, as he must be to make you root for the protagonist as you should in a film of this kind, doesn't help things.I give this film a black or white rating, a cut to the chase, don't waste my time rating, just as Douglas' character no doubt would as the film begins. One star. Worthwhile in that someone may someday be inspired to do a righteous remake of this film with all the outrage and politically incorrect potential totally over the top, really taking the gloves off. That might not make it a great film --in fact, I seriously doubt that it would-- but at least it would make the next Falling Down more memorable and rescue it from blandness that swamps this one. Someone didn't have the strength to put on film what they were feeling, or was out-voted by committee, a not uncommon occurrence in Hollywood. Better luck next time.

The message here seems to be that while it might be cool to flip out, to take out your frustrations against life in general on other people, this won't get you anywhere - those frustrations aren't unique to you, everyone has them, and the only way to cope with them and have a happy life is to accept them and deal with them.

Thus, Falling Down, a drama following a downsized, formerly dedicated defense contractor (D-FENS, reads the vanity plate on his dilapidated hatchback), treads familiar plot territory, even for its release in 1993.  Fortunately, the film navigates its way around the potential for redundancy through a self-critical awareness of the clich√©s it uses to tell the story, using them as just one strength among many in this American allegory. For example, Robert Duvall plays the ubiquitous Last Day on the Job cop, but his colleagues jibe him about that very myth of the mortality of retiring police officers. Furthermore, Duvall's nuanced portrayal of the problems that age and meaningful relationships bring to a masculinity-dominated world allows his character to transcend any mere stereotype.  The film lets the viewer know that yes, it is aware of the cop clich√© and no, Duvall's life is not picture perfect, either. In that same respect, Michael Douglas' protagonist Little Guy, while sympathetic in some respects, is not a very lovable character, and is downright reprehensible at times.  While some would criticize the filmmakers for the flaws in Douglas' character, the film provides enough evidence to show that D-FENS' estrangement from his family and society in general is at least partly his own fault.  Thus, Falling Down avoids the unrealistic depictions of saintly Everymen crushed under the foot of an Evil Empire like the recent Denzel Washington vehicle John Q., and manages to present a complex (read realistic) portrait of the problems in post-Cold War American society, most of which still exist.  After years of focusing on external threats during the Cold War of the Reagan Era, America was forced to examine its many problems at home, and Falling Down delves into them latent racism, unemployment and inflation, drug culture, the apparent breakdown of the family unit. But I digress.  What I'm trying to say is that Falling Down presents a problematic picture of American society on purpose, and it's an entertaining and insightful picture at that.  Those who criticize the film for supposed racism need to realize that the story is told from the perspective of a middle-class American male Caucasian; no one in the movie claims that that is the right or even preferable perspective, it just happens to be the majority perspective.  The standard movie clich√© of One Man Taking a Stand Against the System is that old democratic message; Falling Down adds a more specifically American tone.  The movie goes a bit further than the standard redemptive theme by adding that the one man taking a stand needs to face the problems within himself before trying to overcome those around him - or he may well find himself falling down.  The need for coming to terms with oneself before external reform, while particularly applicable to America in the early 1990s, is a fundamentally human message.  It's a message worth hearing, and Falling Down is a movie worth watching.

The movie was very much accurate in its portrayal of the so-called City of the Angels. Michael Douglas is William D-FENS Foster...Just another hard-working, screwed-over man who believed in making his American Dream come true in the Golden City...Los Angeles, California. Where once the skies were clear, the ocean was blue and the weather warm, there's now a smoggy and congested megalopolis with enough rage to go around for everyone. Bill is a figure that is easy to sympathize with as he relentlessly churns through this bleak and filthy maze, with one thought in his frustrated and exhausted mind...to find his daughter. She is the apple of his eye and is his hope for the future. It is the proverbial wake-up call to be more mindful of those of us who are less fortunate and to help one another...Otherwise there will be more Bill Fosters(I think that tragedies of the last 2 years bear witness to this).Robert Duvall is Officer Prendergast, a man who has been as much or more than Foster but somehow made sense of things and survived. He has doubtless felt the quiet but mounting frustration that Bill has endured, yet he refuses to be drawn into the chaos of Lost Angeles. Prendergast realizes he has to find Bill before it's too late...for the both of them. FALLING DOWN could be considered a story of good against evil...And how they both reside within us.

First, I'm amazed that it got past the development stage. Dealing with development people -- I have, and they're idiots -- what shocks me is that someone understood this film enough to let it fly, during what we might look back at as the height of political correctness. (I'm a comic, so trust me when I say things have eased up again in terms of what you can and can't get away with.) This film took b*lls to make. I'm surprised no one insisted that D-Fens should have a chemical imbalance that forced him to act this way. Whatever Hollywood stuff creeps into the film is there by necessity, and even then I think it's minimal.-- That it's racist. People, do you actually think the folks who made it didn't know that? Like it didn't occur to anyone that the guy is white and most of his targets aren't? It's part of what the film was trying to say, and if you missed that, too bad. What we're left with is a movie that tempts you to actually sympathize with the protagonist. And the worst part is, you might, to some extent. I saw this with a normally reasonable friend who said, I feel bad for this guy. And I said, So does he. That's what started this mess. D-Fens only sees his own situation and no one else's.I don't think this movie gets enough credit. To have the main character take such negative, life-altering action, and yet to be ambiguous enough that it lets you draw your own conclusions, well, I think that's gutsy. How often does a film portray things so wrong and leave open a window so people might find them right? You ain't gonna get a flick like this every year, so appreciate it. I think the guy is big-time sick, but maybe others don't. And that, in case you missed it, was the point.

This film was very much a picture set in the early 90's. The Cold War won and the promised peace dividend was a recession in which the tired old ideas from government and authority had been flogged to death.  Bill Foster ( D-Fens) was a casualty of that world  with the tragic case of not knowing it. Because it can happen to anyone of us. Lose your job , then your wife , then your kid and then probably the dog. Angry at everyone around him , even his own mother , who probably gave him values of hard work gets rewarded. The family man had his life turned upside down . Discarded by his Company , redundant and the feeling of betrayal is very easy to understand. Note the scene , where the plastic surgeon , living a life of splendour and opulence , yet Bill Foster , who studied , worked , got on with his own inner private life had everything taken from him. The plastic surgeon , no good to anyone but the vain and the wealthy , a world that was now closed to Bill Foster. The Land of Opportunity had now turned into a living hell. Where advertisers promote products that are sub-standard.( note the whammy burger scene )Where street gangs ran rampant , yet if they actually had jobs to go to then drive by shootings may well be a rare event. We have the first victim of Bill Foster's angst  as a Korean shopkeeper blatantly profiteers , it could've been an Indian or a white guy , these small-minded petty bourgouis people are out there...his race is an irrelevance. I secretly cheered as D-Fens made his own price adjustments.The most profound scene for me was the black guy , outside the bank , shouting , Not Economically Viable. Bill Foster acknowledges him , as he is taken away in a car , that knowing look of empathy and solidarity. The best is always the killing of the neo-nazi. When the arm store guy tells him that they are the same , Bill Foster says no , Im an American and your a sick f**k. Michael Douglas was great in that film. Playing Bill Foster was for me anyway , his best ever role. Robert Duvall was brilliant as the retiring cop.Facing a day , when it can so easily end in tears. Barbara Hershey was also good as Bill Foster's wife , who at times was neurotic , but believable. I actually wished for a very different ending , you already felt watching the film , that it could end in just one way. The missile scene was over-done. It wasn't nessacary. If you wanted explosions the drive by shooting was a good place or even the Whammy burger joint. Falling Down was one of the best anti-hero films of its time. The observations and incidents , we have probably all been there in one form or another , except perhaps the arms store. Im giving Falling Down 9/10. Great film , great cast , bit over-zealous in places , but a little bit of Bill Foster lies in most of us...its just we dont know it yet. Lets pray we never have to.      "}{"Title":"I'm the bad guy?

Of course, all fiction is contrived, but it shouldn't feel that way.  The premise seems ripe - working stiff family man can't take society's B.S. any longer and we, the audience, are to follow him on a day-long tirade against some of his biggest annoyances.  Unfortunately, the delivery lacks a convincing flow and gets quite awkward at times.  And of course there is the subplot, about a retiring cop who is torn between a controlling wife and a career he is still passionate about.  Those were the really painful scenes - the acting on & around the police force was incredibly bad.  None of the characters seemed real, it's as if they just walked off the set of a sitcom.At times where we are supposed to relate to the main character, it's just too hard, because they seem to mingle with the idea that the man is just a sociopath to begin with rather than an everyman gone nuts.  But most of the time it doesn't matter, because hardly any of it is believable enough anyway.  Not just the story (although we have a guy here walking around with a bag of guns shooting at random, killing a person, and hardly changing his outfit much - and he isn't apprehended or even really identified until the end of the day...yea right), but the lackluster delivery doesn't help either.

But what bothers me, is the fact that some see him as a hero or voice of the everyday consumer, standing up for his rights. A few say the ending wasn't fitting, like it's saying to tell us to lay down and take it. Well, that isn't what this movie is all about. If you watch it a lot of times and listen between the lines, the story is all there. Even Joel Schumacher admitted that D FENS is not the hero but the villain. That's true! Why? Because he's lost it. That's why the title is called Falling Down, because that is exactly what is happening to him. He's falling from reality going insane every time a he passes humiliation. The truth and story of this film is that he blames everyone for what happened to him, as he has lost his job, and he can't see his daughter anymore. Even the video near the end says it all, that he was already disturbed when he was showing what a jerk he is, or the phone call to his wife, Did you know, Beth, that in some South American countries it's still legal to kill your wife if she insults you? He was threatening her, it was a sign he was ill from the beginning. Like when Pendegrast asks his mom where his daughter lives, she says something like He won't tell me, he blames me for what happened. See? He lashes on anything because he thinks they are in his way, when he actually went to them, except for the Surplus salesman and gangsters. Or when he goes to the restaurant he gets a machine gun since he can't have breakfast, but he is late, it's his bad, can't he just accept that? And he wasn't supposed to cross the golf course because it said no trespassing. He did things that were foolish, thus leading to his own demise. You see, he thought he was right but he isn't supposed to use violence. And at the end, when he says I'm the bad guy? How did that happen? I helped build missiles. I helped protect this country. You should be rewarded for that. But instead they give it to the plastic surgeons, you know they lied to me. He blames the plastic surgeons as well. That's the problem with people today, we blame others for our misfortune, and we don't even realize we're to blame. D-FENS blamed everyone for his lost, and does't realize he is at fault. He doesn't know how to let go. That's what we all have a problem with, we just don't know how to let go. And he thought that violence is the solution to problems when it isn't, you see, that is why the ending fits, it shows where it has taken him. But he really wanted to die, the Pendegrast was giving him a chance to live, but he wanted to die than face the music. This isn't a situation where he is the government and D-FENS is the little guy, no. It shows how lashing out to others and blaming others will get you. You reap what sow.

He's a defence worker who, whilst sitting in a traffic jam, suddenly abandons his car. He is desperate to regain contact with his ex-wife, and decides that he must be re-united with her, but she is terrified of his mood swings, and wants to keep him away at all costs.As Foster makes a beeline for his wife, he meets a diverse array of people. He doesn't have enough money to pay a shop owner, and thinks his prices are too high, and so trashes his store. He strays into the territory of some urban youths and narrowly survives a drive-by shooting.These are essentially a series of self-contained sketches, each of which illustrates a different problem of modern life. Even though Foster behaves in a way that seems highly irrational you still sympathise with him, and it's questionable whether he is really any crazier than the society in which he lives.Foster's nemesis is Prendergast, a close-to-retirement cop played by Robert Duvall. As Foster causes mayhem wherever he goes, Prendergast starts to see a pattern, but he is hampered by many of his colleagues, who think he is just imagining things, and trying to delay his retirement as long as possible.The sections featuring Duvall are quite conventional. The cop nearing retirement is a well worn clich√©, but here it's effective, as these scenes lend the film some variety, and complement Douglas's scenes rather than detracting from them. The two main protagonists are both sympathetic in their different ways and each is single minded in the pursuit of their objectives, but it's impossible for both to succeed.There is a surprising amount of comedy in the film, black though it is, generated by Foster's extreme reactions to seemingly innocuous events. Against all the odds the comedy succeeds, mainly thanks to Douglas, who turns in one of his best ever performances, as a man pushed too far by events beyond his control.Foster could be dismissed as a lone nut-case, but there can't be many who haven't contemplated acting as he does at one time or another. He sees himself as just an ordinary man trying to live a normal life, and is genuinely amazed when told he is considered a bad guy.Falling Down is a terrific film, which illustrates some of society's problems through the travails of its central character. It's amazingly effective at getting its point across, while retaining some ambiguity on the question of whether Foster is a hero or a villain. That's left for you to decide.

'Falling Down' is only hollow, glossy Hollywood hokum, but it expects the audience to believe that it is tackling serious issues head on, which I suppose it does up to a point, but the result is unsatisfying, and frankly, one big cop-out.The film was directed by Joel Schumacher, and stars Michael Douglas with Barbara Hershey, Robert Duvall, and in a miniscule part as Duvall's wife, Tuesday Weld, a classic example of a fine actress wasted by the Hollywood system. But that's another story. The problems of this film begin with the conception of its main character, Bill Foster (Michael Douglas). The first half of the film's footage involves Foster leaving his car behind in the middle of a traffic jam and walking around aimlessly in Travis Bickle fashion trying to figure out what the city of Los Angeles has finally been reduced to. A lot of ranting goes on about the parlous state of the American nation with a number of pointless characters to ram it home to the audience that modern day Los Angeles is merely a microcosm of the deplorable state of the rest of the country. Douglas, in a very brave performance is from the outset characterised as a complete nut so there is little suspense and even less point to his childish and pointless rampage.Within the first twenty minutes it's revealed that Foster has been retrenched from his government job; he has also been divorced, but nevertheless is a fine upstanding American. (The only proof we have of this is his run in with a bikie gun fascist in a rifle shop in which Foster routs him and castigates him for not being American enough.) The only thing Foster seems to believe is that the system has screwed him, so he decides, 'to take action'. This consists of shooting up a Korean mixed business so that the owner runs out on the street screaming and terrified, getting rid of some roadside workers with a stray bazooka because they're holding up the traffic and terrorising a group of elderly golfers so that one of them has a heart attack and dies. All this mayhem because he's been stuck in a traffic jam in downtown L.A.! Naturally Foster's behaviour attracts the attention of the police, and they attempt to second guess what he's going to do next, but since the guy does not have all his marbles, this becomes a difficult prospect. By the second half of the film, the director dumps his audience like a rejected lover, and we are left to our own devices, to be led into a number of boring subplots concerning Foster's personal problems and the detective who is in charge of the case's marriage problems, which are tedious and do nothing to explain the inexplicable. Barbara Hershey gives a tolerable performance as Foster's estranged wife and there is a denouement of sorts which acknowledges that as we all know, the man doing these things is not in his right mind, so he therefore commits suicide, leaving behind a cute little daughter who will no longer have to worry about having a nut for a father.Schumacher lays on a lot of pointless melodramatics to supposedly reassure us that because we are watching a nut we therefore have nothing to worry about. Reasonable people don't get this upset or only attempt to take steps to take control of their lives in a law abiding fashion ( in spite of the exact government indifference to their plight which this film is purporting to illustrate.) It's in this way, practically everyone has a right to feel offended by this film. The real life problems of the mentally ill are mocked and trivialised, and the well adjusted amongst us are lectured by a lurking reactionary subtext to take what the system dishes out to us. In other words, only the mentally ill would be interested in changing a system that according to this film ultimately works, Falling Down leaves a very bitter aftertaste because it is so intellectually dishonest. Its methods are underhand and exhibit the Hollywood studio way of fleecing the punters with sense enough to know they are, in actual fact, being robbed by a system that uses them up, then spits them out, and then have to swallow the logical surmise that the people who made this film really don't give a damn about it.'Falling Down' is a nasty piece of work, cynical in its purpose, totally specious in its overview of ordinary people and their struggles, and also demeaning to those who know what it's like to experience mental health issues because of outside circumstances they are powerless to control. It's not recommended; it is bad and hopelessly conceived on all possible levels, be it art, social commentary or entertainment. As an afterthought entertainment is something it sorely lacks, considering 'Falling Down's' overly anxious and ultimately unsuccessful attempts to have itself taken so seriously.

This is merely the tip of the iceberg however and 'D-Fens' become more and more irate as he continually encounters people that rub him up the wrong way when he is merely trying to get back home to see his daughter. As time progresses, D-Fens behaviour becomes more erratic, unpredictable and dangerous and officer Prendergast (Robert Duvall) on his last day on the force makes it his mission to stop D-Fens as quickly as possible.Had this film been handled better then it could have been an excellent character study. I got the impression here that D-Fens was intended to be somebody that we can identify with and relate to but for me these aspects of the story didn't really come together too well mainly for two reasons;1) THE STORY - Initially it starts out well and some of the plot elements are believable - nobody likes being stuck in traffic and yes I'm sure we all have days where we'd love to abandon our cars in the middle of a traffic jam. I think the most believable scenario in this film is where D-Fens tries to order breakfast a few minutes after the cut off time and is told that he needs to get something from the lunch menu. The first thing that came to my head was 'Jobsworth' and D-Fens frustration here is understandable even if his behaviour is not. Where it fell apart for me was when D-Fens stole the guns from the gangsters and went on his killing spree - it felt like a slight overstep to me as it was possible to feel some sympathy for and relate to D-Fens up to this point. Now to the second major problem with this film; 2) D-FENS CHARACTER - My understanding is that this was intended as a character study and perhaps the point here was to give an insight into how a series of everyday problems can cause a potentially unbalanced individual to snap. The problem with this film is that it never attempts to really explain D-Fens behaviour and doesn't bother offering much of an insight into his mind or thought process. Mental Health Issues are thrown around now and again, but the filmmakers never really attempt to explain D-Fens behaviour. I'm not normally a fan of voiceovers, but I do think that it might have been beneficial here just to try to gain more of an understanding of the protagonist.Falling Down is perhaps worth watching once but only really for Michael Douglas. He puts in an excellent performance here where he very much plays against type and it's a pity that his character wasn't given the depth needed to make this a great film. When the film ended I couldn't help but feel that Martin Scorsese's Taxi Driver had more depth and gave a much better insight into the mind of a crazed and disaffected individual.

Going into a store run by a Korean, he objects to the prices of items, takes the owner's baseball bat, and starts beating him and the merchandise. He's on a roll.After he beats some gang members, he calls his ex-wife on the phone. The gang goes looking for him, sees him, and starts shooting. People fall left and right. Not Foster. The gang crashes their car. Foster walks over to them, all dead but one, and says to the one alive, You missed. He shoots him with the guy's gun, steals the bag of guns the gang was carrying and takes off.Complaints start coming into the police precinct, where it's Prendergast's last day, and he has his own problems. Eventually he puts two and two together and realizes this is the same guy with whom he was in the traffic jam. Over his wife's (Tuesday Weld) objections, he stays late to see if he can find Foster.I think anyone living an urban life, especially in a big city, can sympathize with the Foster character. We've all felt like he has, life can really get to you. Foster's ex-wife (Barbara Hershey) is terrified of him and has an order of protection on him. It's his daughter's birthday and he's told he can't see her. He lost his job a month ago and his mother still thinks he's working. Life's problems pile up.The scariest scene takes place in a surplus shop, and it goes to show that times really haven't changed. This movie could have been made yesterday. The Nazi loving redneck running it (Frederic Forrest) who is, admittedly, way out there, objects to having two gay guys in his store and drives them out. I reserve the right, he yells at them. He hates everyone - Jews, gays, you name it.Douglas does an excellent job as a man who has had just one too many things go wrong on a boiling hot Los Angeles day. Robert Duvall does a masterful job as Prendergast, a man who suffered a tragedy in his life and understands his aggressive wife better than anyone. Tuesday Weld is amazing in the character role of the wife, moving out of the blond beauty leading lady parts easily.Most of us plow through to the next day. Foster falls down. Admittedly his world is sadder. I did everything they told me, he says, speaking of his time serving his country. We all do and somehow, like Foster, it just doesn't turn out as we expected.

The thing is, Foster has, shall we say, become a little unbalanced due to certain problems and is prone to violent outbursts, so when Foster decides to just leave his car in the middle of a traffic jam, he starts off on a journey taking him through various incidents from dealing with gang members to just trying to get breakfast. Robert Duvall plays L.A. Detective Prendergast, a cop who is just trying to get through his last day before retirement but unwittingly gets caught up in trying to find Foster.I had first seen Falling Down when it came out in 1993. I thought it was a good movie then and after seeing it again 21 years later, I still think it's a good movie. Falling Down is most definitely not a vigilante movie, and I can't see how anyone can even think it is. If anyone thinks it is then they really need to look up the definition of what a vigilante actually is.The story is one that we can all relate to as well in some form or another as I'm sure we've all had that fast food dinner that looks nothing like it's picture, encountered ignorant workmen, or had obnoxious people complaining about the littlest of things. The difference is, most of us wouldn't act out in the way that Foster does, but I think that's where it poses the question...how would YOU handle these situations if you were in Fosters shoes? The film does get a wee bit slow & repetitive in places as well with Foster wandering from incident to incident, but in a way it's these incidents - and how a seemingly average guy handles them - is what keeps it going. That and, of course, Douglas' great performance.While obviously not being a comedy, Falling Down does have some really good touches of darker comedic moments in the attempt to break some of the seriousness of what is happening in the film.All in all, Falling Down is a really decent movie to watch, so if you've not seen it yet then it's one I recommend giving a go. "},{"Title":"An advanced social criticism","Date":"8 January 2010","Score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Crime, Drama, Thriller","Review":" Falling Down is probably the funniest movie of the year. It is also a serious, though not totally successful, attempt at social drama. What is useful for us as writers is to see why this strange mix works so well.All good writing begins with design, and Falling Down is no exception. Let's look at some choices.The typical writer who wanted to tell a story of a man who faced the lie of the American dream would probably place the hero in a crumbling neighborhood or a brutal company. The larger forces of society would attack relentlessly, the hero would fight back valiantly. The result a one-beat social issue story that no one sees.The writer of Falling Down chose a very different structure. First, and most importantly, he gives the story a myth foundation. This automatically gives the film an epic quality and kicks it up to an American scale. In particular, this is the ever-popular Odyssey story in which the hero must get home.Second, the writer turns the myth structure/Odyssey story on its head; the home is a broken one, the man is slightly wacky, and the wife doesn't want him. This makes the film an anti-Odyssey story, which means that the overall structure will itself express the theme of the lie of the American dream.Third, the writer makes most of the social conflict scenes comedic. Not only does this relieve the monotony of the usual social drama, it moves the story into the realm of the black comedy, which is the most devastating of all social fiction. But the writer goes further still. Had he simply made this a black comedy, it would likely have fallen victim to the usual vice of the black comedy being too rarefied for the audience. The brilliant design move in Falling Down was combining the black comedy with the myth structure, making the film universal, accessible and thematically powerful at the same time. Let's look at the structure of this film in more detail to see how it really works.Problem/Need The main character, Bill (aka DeFens), is in trouble from the opening scene. Stuck in a traffic jam, Bill is invaded from all sides by the sights and sounds of social crush. He is indeed on the defensive, and when he runs away from his car, he finds not relief but rather more assault. Even worse, Bill has also lost his job at the defense plant and his ex-wife has a restraining order that prevents him from seeing the little daughter he loves.Bill's need - what is lacking within the character - is where this film hits its first stumbling block. In order to show a man who is willing to use weapons in response to social slights, the writer has had to make him psychotic. Not only does this prevent the audience from identifying with the hero, it reduces the ultimate impact of the social commentary. It also makes it impossible for the hero to have a real moral need. This man has no control over his actions, so he cannot be blamed, even when he terrorizes his wife. The film partly overcomes this weakness by making Bill's complaints so reasonable and his attackers so recognizable. But the fact remains that this man has a few screws loose.Desire Bill's goal, like Dorothy's and Ulysses', is to get home to his family. Myth stories have a tendency to be episodic, so the writer wisely adds a time element to the hero's journey to add momentum. Bill must get home in time for his daughter's birthday party. The irony of course is that this is no longer Bill's home. Notice how the use of an ironic goal allows the structure to carry the theme. Bill's goal, which is nothing less than the idealized American dream, is in reality an ugly nightmare of divorce and separation. And the fragmentation that the hero experiences in the city at large is found in even worse form at the endpoint of his journey.Opposition As in any myth structure, Bill encounters a succession of opponents in his journey home. The strength of the myth form is that the journey gives the story a vast scope; the hero meets an array of people who represent a number of ethnic and economic categories. The weakness of the form is that it makes all of these opponents superficial. Since each opponent can only be seen for a brief time, the writer can give no one real definition. The film has rightfully been criticized for taking easy shots the Latino gangbangers, the Korean grocer, the plastic surgeon. This lack of deep targets is the primary reason why the film remains superficial in its social commentary.A more advanced form of social criticism would have searched for the web connecting all these disparate opponents under the surface. For while these people are clearly part of a fragmented world, they are also part of a system that creates fragmentation. The writer's job is to find that system. Indeed the great power of the black comedy, as a story form, is not that it shows painful comedy, but that it explores the logic system that governs a society. This attention to logic, or more precisely illogic, is what sets Goodfellas apart as a great black comedy.To finish reading this review and to find others, please visit http//www.truby.com/im_fd.html "}{"Title":"Falling Down","Date":"23 November 2009","Score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Crime, Drama, Thriller","Review":" The idea of an everyman coming into contact with a dystopian society is actually quite old. This film updates the entire concept with the premise that someone actually steps out of his car in Los Angeles, where nobody walks except those who don't have a car, bus-fare, or a need to actually leave their neighbourhoud.Our so-called hero steps out of his bubble, and engages an entire sub-culture that makes no sense to him, but requires a hostile response to the events that befall him. I'm not sure that I would be as adaptable, but Los Angelians would know. How far would you go to extricate yourself (and ultimately your loved ones) from an environment of arbitrary violence? As someone said, There seems to be no clear message. Who was right? Who was wrong? It becomes a very blurry line over the approximately 2 hours of the movie's run. Are we expected to agonize over who was right or wrong? Even in my little Canadian home-town, I was threatened with handguns and worse in my early days (late 60s, early 70s) and had no particular recourse for any of this, outside of avoiding this network of acquaintances, having survived.Should we all be assured a hygienic and risk-free environment as soon as we step outside of our comfort zones? Does the casual Social Contract even approach this concept - especially in uber-cities? No - you plays yer money, and you takes yer chance. Common sense remains the least common commodity. Those who have it will prosper (except for random events). Those who do not possess it will keep wandering into nasty situations, where the potential for a random, disinterested and brutal death is always a possibility.

Something very different from director Joel Schumacher, something we would have perhaps expected to see in the hands of Oliver Stone, with his no nonsense, hard hitting approach. Schumacher's films are very diverse though, and include St.Elmo's Fire, Dying Young and Flatliners.This time our director has tackled the issue of the way society is today. Michael Douglas is 'D-Fens', a man who decides he cannot stand the way things have become, both in the world and in his own life, and so he decides to take action, and I mean action! Falling Down is a violent film which tries to comment on society's 'illnesses'. Sadly our hero resorts to all out war to make his point, and this of course solves nothing.The actual plot of the movie (which regards 'D-Fens' trek across LA to see his estranged wife and daughter) is the real base of the story, however it only serves as a distraction from the real issue.Michael Douglas returns to top form in an unaccustomed and menacing role, and is ably supported by Robert Duvall, Barbara Hershey, Rachel Ticotin and Tuesday Weld. The music (James Newton Howard) and cinematography also work well.Falling Down does expose the dark side of humanity well, and shows that the world we live in is not a good one, while still pointing out that combating violence with violence is futile. Unfortunately it offers few answers, and one cannot sympathise with a lead character who so quickly becomes that which he despises. Perhaps Oliver Stone could have made a more confronting picture.Desperately needed a more sympathetic, average guy hero.Monday, July 19, 1993 - Village Centre Melbourne "},{"Title":"Don't mess with D-Fens","Date":"26 September 2006","Score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Crime, Drama, Thriller","Review":" This a movie about a man who gets even with society.

"},{"Title":"Not as bad as expected","Date":"22 June 2006","Score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Crime, Drama, Thriller","Review":" As far as I'm concerned, Joel Schumacher is the epitome of what people mean when they disparagingly call something 'too Hollywood' he likes his explosions HUGE, his emotions sappy and his characters paper-thin. So, with that in mind, I had low expectations of 'Falling Down,' but watched it anyway. (For a change, I wasn't watching it because of my wife, but because I've always been a little intrigued by the premise. It was only Schumacher that kept me from it before now.) It's not unreasonable to say the movie surpassed my expectations, but not my much. This is a hard film to get a grip on. Is it a comedy? Is it an action movie? Is it the story of a psycho on the loose? Is it a biting satire/commentary on society? Is it a racist diatribe? It seems 'Falling Down' is a little of all these, but it's often difficult to tell if this is intentional, or because writer Ebbe Roe Smith (an actor writing, rarely a good sign) lost the thread somewhere along the way. Again, it seems a little of both. For instance, there are clear indications of intentional parallels to be drawn between the D-FENS and Prendergast (the off-kilter women in their lives, 'London Bridge is Falling Down,' their general demeanours). However, with those same two characters, we see an unravelling of narrative parallels (D-FENS attacks the Korean shopkeep with open racial malice while Prendergast carelessly assumes the Korean and the Japanese cop speak the same language; D-FENS battles the Mexican gang guys, and Prendergast has to fight to weasel his way into his Mexican coworker's case) that seem intentional at first but may have just been coincidental. Then there's the view of D-FENS as a man on the verge of becoming (to borrow a term from 'Manhunter'), and the two directions we can see him going. Could he have been a quiet fighter for justice like Prendergast, or would his vigilantism have been a slippery slope to the homophobic/homoerotic leatherboy Nazi fantasy of 'Nick, The Nazi Surplus Store Owner'? (I won't even go into that whole twisted scene! Was that homoeroticism intentional? I REALLY hope so...I'd hate to think someone could come up with that without meaning to.) Beyond all this symbolic nonsense lies the movie itself, truly a Schumacher piece. The explosions are indeed huge, the emotions are certainly sappy, and the characters are so thin you can practically see through them. The script, though at times inventive and thought-provoking, contains some terrible dialogue and it is often painful to watch two heavy-hitters like Duvall and Douglas struggle with what's in their mouths. The cast beyond them is filled out with some of the stiffest actors I've ever seen supporting playing even flimsier characters than the leads (what was the deal with the super-obnoxious guy paired up with Prendergast's gal-pal?). So, what was this movie? It was (I hope) a dark comedy action antihero diatribe, but it was also a half-assed attempt at depicting America in a single human. That human, of course, is our main character William 'D-Fens' Foster. He's not just an average American, but the country itself. It's not necessarily apparent at first viewing, but it really all comes together when, just before he's shot to death (your spoiler, ladies and gents) Prendergast assures D-FENS he's 'the bad guy' (in almost exactly the same way other characters have evoked his disbelief when they expect the absolute worst from him). His response is, 'How did that happen? I did everything they told me to.' Therein lies the crux of the movie and the character he is America, which has become the 'bad guy' to most of the world, in spite of (perhaps because of) doing everything it thought its own populace and the world stage wanted. But (as ably illustrated in the home movie when he's forcing the kid onto the rocking horse he was going to buy her AGAIN this year), it was always more about what he/it wanted countries don't ask to be invaded and have their dictators toppled, but America's always been more than willing to do it for them...as long as there's something in it for America. All told, this wasn't a bad movie, just typically heavy-handed for Schumacher. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone, and I'm glad it was a late-night flick I didn't have to pay for. The biggest success of the entire film, regrettably, is that it conveys that it was a hot day, a damn hot day.

And then there's this fly buzzing around... sure, you know what that's all about, eh? But you don't snap, do you? You don't just leave your car in the middle of the road. And you don't make your way on foot through the city, lashing out at anyone you run across to ease your own pain, your growing frustration. You might, though, if you're a white-collar worker like the one played by Douglas. He's reached a midway point in some ugly midlife crisis as this story begins and by the half-hour mark, he's gone beyond the point of no return. Who can identify with him? - try about 20 million middle class American males. Douglas creates an interesting and compelling character here. He's not completely crazy nor is he entirely oblivious to his surroundings in his obsessed determination to reach 'home.' What he is, though, is very angry, just boiling mad - probably because he held it all in for his entire adult life up to this point. So when he runs across the various inane qualities that make up big city modern life - rude shopkeepers, local gang members, vapid fast food rules - well, this takes its cue from the film Network - he's mad as hell and not gonna take it anymore. It's a bit on the simplistic side but we soon realize it's not meant to be a fully realistic slice of life. We've all probably felt that twinge of embarrassment over all those huge golf courses taking up all that space - this is wish fulfillment fantasy on what we might do in a daydream. By the time he uses that rocket launcher as a protest against the misuse of a construction contract budget, we realize its more of a parable, a satire and commentary on our society. The interest is in going on this journey with Douglas and see what he next encounters. I think it stretched things past a limit during his confrontation with the neo-Nazi skinhead bigot-nutcase, but even that scene served to underscore the differences between the two Douglas did come across as racist during his earlier scene with the Korean shopkeeper, but he was more irritated by the man's inability to enunciate English words than anything else; let's face it, Douglas is just fuming about everyone here - there's not much discrimination. Just check out his nasty parting remarks to the rich old white fat-cat on the golf course.In a parallel storyline, we see another fine actor, Duvall, as a cop on the verge of retiring - this is literally his last day on the job. His scenes with the other cops and, over the phone, with his tiring wife, lack the intensity of Douglas being on the move and, after a couple of minutes of such easygoing charm, we want to get back to Douglas on the prowl. But it all comes together in the end; Douglas & Duvall seemed to be heading for similar fates (it's hinted more than once that Duvall may end up being shot) but in the climax their respective destinies were always to be completely at odds with each other - we just don't realize this until it ends.

It's the perfect example of an everyday person who just has one messed up day, and yet you kind of feel sorry for the lead even though you can clearly tell he has problems...the only thing is that we all have similar problems.The DVD version is a disappointment since it's pretty bare bones, but if Warner Brothers ever decides to re-release an updated version, I'm pretty certain it would sell well.

I hate Joel Schumacher for desecrating the Batman franchise with Batman and Robin, but I am ever grateful for his direction of this milestone of a movie. Before you read the rest of this comment, I'd like you to look at the Maltin Review, the link for which is at the left of this page under the Plot and Quotes section (it's very short).I asked you to do this for two reasons. First of all, Mr. Maltin makes the observation that the movie is very well acted, and this is true.  Each character is portrayed so convincingly that the movie is almost disturbingly real.  I finally have a professional to substantiate one of my views....Secondly, the Maltin Review (ignorantly) poses an important question that I wish to explain.  The question is What's the point?  More than anything else, this movie is a social commentary.  It states that morality is decaying.  Our values and ethics are gradually wasting away.  Each of Foster's (D-Fens) obstacles lacks some sort of decency or respect. Foster himself represents the American goodness that seems to be disappearing from our populace.So what does Douglas's character do when he is brought to confront these obstacles?  He acts accordingly.  The viewer should note that Douglas always gives these people what they deserve.  All of his aggressors-changed-victims get exactly what they had coming to them, and nothing more.  The store owner is set straight for running a consumer-unfriendly business, the gang members die for their own stupidity in trying to take another's life, even the Whammy Burger gets justice for not employing humanity and kindness in its restaurant.Towards the end, it begins to look as if Foster has gone over the edge. But he really hasn't.  He's simply dishing out the justice that the law prohibits. Foster is righteousness incarnate.  Although he crosses the boundary of legality, he never commits the immoral.  But one man can't get rid the world of its filth, and by the end of the film, we notice that the line between good and bad is severely blurred.  I can't reveal the end, nor do I want to, but the most significant line of the movie occurs within the last 3 minutes--watch it and you'll see exactly what I mean.Okay, I may as of yet failed to explain the point of the movie. Sorry. The point is that common decency is in a downward spiral, and there's nothing we can do to help it.  THE GOOD AND THE DECENT ARE OPPRESSED BY THE WICKED (not to sound too biblical).  Maybe it's just bad parenting or something, but too many people fail to be compassionate toward their fellow human beings. Take, take, take--Ask not what your fellow man can do for you, but what you can do for your fellow man, for God's sake.As for the title of this comment, here's something for those of you who have seen the movie. (DON'T READ IF YOU HAVEN'T SEEN IT!!)-The main scenes of the movie are practically foreshadowed with the bumper stickers in the traffic jam.-The scene in the back of the army surplus store is the turning point. (I can't. I'll fall down.)  No kidding.  When Foster's glasses crack so does he.  Its the first and only time he voluntarily kills someone.-The not economically viable man is wearing the same outfit as Douglas, tie and all, hinting at the obvious--that Douglas isn't (socially?) viable either. You can *sense* the understanding between the two even though no words are exchanged.There are tons of other thought-provoking though seemingly invisible elements in this movie.  This includes the whole falling down leitmotif that requires an entire essay itself.The last thing I wish to touch upon is the fact that there are no perfect motives in the movie.  For example, when Foster is trashing Mr. Lee's store, we notice that a jar of American flags falls to the floor and breaks, almost defeating Foster's patriotic speech about Lee's corrupt business.  Later, after creating a scene at the Whammy Burger for being denied breakfast, Foster changes his mind and orders lunch instead.  We would like to sympathize with Foster for just wanting to see his family, but in the end we see how violently he kisses his wife, and suddenly it appears that he has gone perhaps a bit to far.  Each of these incidents inspires some sort of sympathy for Foster's aggressors, further testament to the fact that the line between good and bad has been blurred.This movie stole my heart with its previews.  No film I've ever seen comes close to being so fulfilling. Falling Down will satisfy 99% of its audience. Take my word for it.*please*.

Perhaps it wasn't what I knew, but what I hoped, and despite Joel Schumaker's nearly unforgivable slop-jobs in the latest Batman movies, I got exactly what I hoped from this film.Every scene with Foster is just the way I'd do it if I were falling down the logic, the coolness, the rational and intentional violence.  At one point I asked myself why I found this morbidly funny and entertaining, especially the Whammyburger locale.  But with each scene, Foster proclaims that he 'just wants to go home' and the audience can identify with the simplicity of his objective.Most every sequence in this film starts with a long, mastershot of the city, coupled with brooding music.  As one begins to pick Foster out of the crowd, the impression would almost be that what is shown is nothing more than an urban battleground, one soldier fighting a war against his world.Which brings me to my point 'Falling Down' isn't a drama, isn't a comedy, isn't action, it's a war film.  It's plain and simple-- Foster is waging war. this film is like the Saving Private Ryan of the urban decay genre.  The writing and performance aspects are solid gold, not a hollow moment is to be found in Michael Douglas.  The plot is a perfect Journey archtype, much like Apocalypse Now.  Every scene has new people and new situations, yet all lead to the same theme of civilization desecration.Tolka's advice Pause after each scene with D-Fens and ask yourself, can you blame him?.

I just don't want to be blacklisted! What struck me about this film is that the protagonist (good guy) and antagonist (bad guy) are not as clear as in some two-dimensional plot-lines. What brought this idea home was at the end, when Michael Douglas says, in utter astonishment, You mean I... I'm the bad guy?  Since this is in the point of view of what, in most films, would be the antagonist, (he is after all, causing civil unrest, property damage, etc. to the dismay of the police and in particular, a soft-hearted old Robert Duvall who is about to retire--bring on the violins!) the audience has sympathized with him, as audiences usually do to the character whose side of the story they know most about.  One might even say that the roles of the good guy and the bad guy have been reversed entirely.  Why? Consider the personalities of the two central characters.  Is it not Duvall who seems the most dishonest of the two? After all, he is the one who, to comfort his wife, tells her anything to appease her hysteria.  He is the one who cons the mother of Douglas's character to get what he needs from her. In contrast, Douglas is always very straight forward with the people that displease him to the vetI'm not giving you my money,to the fast food cashier But...I want breakfast!, to the psycho with the army surplus stash We are not the same...I...am an                       American...and you...are a madman? it's                       been a while Most shocking, at the end, Duvall does not even want to discuss anything. He pulls his gun and is no nonsense.  All he wants is to get this over with and get home to his wife which he has finally put in her place. However, these are evidences only to the small minded.  This movie is not that simple.  Although he attacks things in our society that are irritable to us all, he is still attacking.  Most importantly, this behavior did not start with his dismissal from his job.  In the home movie which he watches in his wife's home after he realizes that she and their daughter are not there, we see him at on one of his daughter's birthdays, insisting that she ride the horse-thing that he bought her despite her crying protests.  He is a controlling person, and when he doesn't get his way he is, as evidenced by most of this movie, able to resort to extreme measures.This is probably why he was fired from his job in the first place, though, of course, an employer would not say You're a psycho, don't come back! Ironically, he identifies himself with the man protesting in the street who was told that he was no longer viable, as presumptuous as the army surplus man identifying with him, Douglas's character. In short, this is a film that can be enjoyed on many levels.  Every piece of it seems to have a greater meaning.  By the way, for some reason it took me a long time to figure out that Falling Down, in addition to being the perfect phrase for the way Douglas's character felt, also referred to the song on the music box which Duvall sung along to in order to soothe his hysterical wife.  The song,London Bridge, was also where he and his wife were planning to visit.  The sno-dome thing that played the song was not unlike the sno-dome thing that Douglas had bought as a birthday present for his daughter.  What a great movie!

He's middle-aged, middle-class, and in the middle of a frightful nervous breakdown.His employment prospects have slipped down the pan. His marriage has followed it. Yet both of these things prove transient for many people. However; like many good, kindly men and willing fathers; thanks to that relentless bigotry of feminism, even the best are treated as if they're the worst. After all; they're male, aren't they? When I first sat to watch this movie, I assumed I was going to see a black comedy about an ordinary Joe who got pushed beyond his limit and began rebelling against the expected subjugation of his goodwill. A sort of 'Reginald Perrin' with attitude. And that's certainly how the story begins. We see this schmuck trapped by the vicissitudes of modern life on a sweltering-hot day, begin ignoring the acculturated fences and start cutting a swathe through problems and inconveniences in a fashion that has most of us envying his grit and self-will, and cheering his disregard of conventionality.But this is Hollywood, and such heroes can only exist in comedy. If rebellion became truly idealised - well...what then? The comfortable status quo would be subverted, and that would never do. Men might even begin to demand equal treatment. Outrageous.This man's anarchic responses take a progressively more confrontational turn as the evident balance of his mind tilts towards mental illness. Partway through his aberrant career, a retiring police-officer (ho-hum, yawn) is alerted and a manhunt begins.From this point on, the story degenerates into a predictable, formulaic piece of misandric trash. Basically; he's not just a guy who has had everything taken away and fighting back; he's a murderous ex-husband on a mission of lethal revenge against his former wife, with whom the anti-male state has conspired to deprive him of all he has valued. There's only one solution then. It's inevitable. You can see it coming from that point on.If the movie had been intelligent, it could have shown the history of his tragic decline - perhaps by back-flashes - and developed a sensitive (though improbable) denouement in reconciliation. But the makers weren't up for sympathetic backfill or honorable reprieve. This man was just a dead-beat dad who was earmarked for death. Plain and sickeningly simple.Every player acquits themselves well. The technical issues are all up to snuff. Still I came away with nothing but contempt for this movie, its makers, and the ingrained misandric intolerance it continues to propagate.

We all have our boiling points, yet the boundaries of society normally prevent us from exploding at the simple injustices presented day by day. However, in the case of William Foster (Michael Douglass) from Joel Schumacher's Falling Down, he lashes out at every simple societal transgression after he loses his job, gets divorced from his wife, and is issued a restraining order so that he is not able to see his daughter. The violent acts performed by the frustrated Foster are what make Falling Down worth a rent. Every person has their pet peeves about how society functions and it is really interesting to watch a common citizen attack the fundamental norms of everyday life in America. For example, in one scene Foster goes to a fast food restaurant in order to eat breakfast only to discover that breakfast is no longer served because it is 1135 a.m. and the restaurant quit serving at 1130 (I've been there). Where most of us would just be disappointed and would order something off the lunch menu, Foster whips out a gun and begins shooting the place up. There are several scenes such as this that are really entertaining. Unfortunately the scenes where Foster is not thrashing out at people are where this film suffers. There are a lot of scenes that I felt were not needed. I love Robert Duvall but we've seen his retiring cop character many times in other films. In all honesty every time his character appeared on screen I simply wanted Schumacher to cut to a scene in which Foster was belaboring the citizens of L.A. Overall, this film is filled with some fascinating scenes and a great performance by Michael Douglass. So although the story did not keep me captivated and the other characters are not nearly as interesting as Foster, some specific scenes are enough for me to recommend Falling Down.

Although there are some similarities between these two movies, Taxi Driver is in a whole different league. Falling Down is less heavy and more lighthearted. Although, the fact that the movie here on IMDb is being categorized as a comedy isn't exactly right. The movie is more of a thriller that is brought in a refreshing and not too heavy way but never without loosing its power or without making a statement.Mostly the movie is more of a social comment then anything else. It shows how an more or less average man one day gets fed up with the rotten society and tries to take matters into his own hands, which gets him into some 'unlikely' but also still somewhat recognizable situations. The movie is told in such a way that it implies that this could happen to every one of us. Therefor it's a bit too bad that toward the ending it becomes more and more obvious that the main character already had psychological problems to begin with. It doesn't really make the movie any less powerful or without making its point clear but its also a sort of an unnecessary addition to the story, that becomes a bit too 'Hollywood-ized' because of this. The movie its story is nothing too impressive but yet it is refreshing and enough stuff to make you think.It's too bad that Michael Douglas never plays more roles like this. He is excellent in this movie and above all, he is highly believable in his role. I even dare to say that this is one of his very best roles till date. Robert Duvall is also great as the detective.

It's easy to see the confrontations that Douglas has with various people as comical, and also rather coincidental - but the film takes it's comedy to an extent to that it really bites, and Falling Down certainly benefits from it's edge of humour. The film follows the idea of a man on the edge; a man sick of it all.

All this happens on the same day that veteran police officer Martin Prendergast is retiring to live with his wife; but first he must find the white shirt-wearing, briefcase-carrying madman causing havoc in the city.This film really comes together because of an absolutely great performance from Michael Douglas. I'm not a big fan of Douglas, but here he looks sinister enough to be believable, while retaining a potent flavour of satiety to ensure that the film works as an expose of the things that a lot of would like to do. The image of Douglas' short-wearing office worker trudging through the streets, baseball bat in hand is one of the truly indelible images of this film. The meetings that Douglas has with various members of society, including a territorial gang, a couple of golf players and, best of all, a Neo-Nazi gun shop owner are absurdly funny, and while something of a coincidence; many of them see Douglas make a good point, and the most shocking thing about this movie stems from the fact that we know the lead character is a social deviant - but he's so often right! As you might expect, the action scenes are well done and often take centre focus - but Schumacher never lets the focus leave the main character and his plight. Overall, Falling Down is a film that both entertains and makes its audience think, and I wouldn't hesitate to name this film as one of the very best of the nineties.

I suppose it's not his fault that he's been reduced to playing a stereotyped detective in Falling Down, one who is (as is so often the case in such cliched assembly line movies) on the verge of retirement when he's called out on one last case.  Well, Duvall's fault or not, it is his visage that was rapidly flashing across my TV screen as I fast-forwarded past his scenes to the slightly more interesting ones with Michael Douglas.  If I were of another generation, one that thought of Douglas as something other than Kirk's son, perhaps I would not find this double Oscar winner (for co-producing One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest and as best actor for Wall Street) so undistinguished.  To me, he reached his peak as Karl Malden's partner on TV's Streets of San Francisco and comes across on screen as smaller than life.  In Falling Down, he is D-Fens (a name taken from his personalized license plate), a burnt out defense department worker who thinks the world is going to Hell in that proverbial handbasket.  On a day when the temperature in Los Angeles would make even Hades seem cool, D-Fens finally cracks and goes on a violent rampage with the aid of a machine gun he swipes from a gang member.  With his nerdy buzz-cut, short-sleeved white shirt, and pocket protector, Douglas puts on an entertaining show, if not a credible one.  But who can blame him?  The direction by Joel Schumacher is pedestrian, and so is the script by Ebbe Roe Smith.  As Douglas' wife, the lovely Barbara Hershey is wasted, while Tuesday Weld as Duvall's plump, nagging wife is unrecognizable.  Falling Down isn't dull, that's for sure, but it's little more than a cleaned-up retread of Death Wish, a much more provocative film.

Finally he snaps & gets out of his car & decides to walk home, on the way he wants to call his ex-wife Beth (Barbara Hershey) & check on his daughter Adele (Joey Hope Singer). However he runs out of change, he goes into the nearest shop to ask for some but the owner (Michael Paul Chan) won't give him any. William completely flips & smashes the shop up with a baseball bat but still pays for his Coke, he sets off on foot across L.A. & gets into more trouble as he fights back against the things in society which annoy him...This French American co-production was directed by Joel Schumacher & is an interesting film that almost works, as it is it's a watchable piece of moralistic exploitation but it isn't quite the classic that it could have been. The script by Ebbe Roe Smith has a fascinating premise that many of us have probably thought about doing ourselves that of an ordinary man lashing out against the petty bureaucracy & the pressures of everyday life in a spectacular way. It's starts out terrifically with Douglas just leaving his car in the middle of a traffic jam because walking would be quicker & I just love the scene in the burger restaurant where he makes a impassioned speech about the difference in the picture of a burger & the one he actually gets as it's a scene I can really relate to! However while Falling Down starts out as a dark comedic attack on consumerism & has a nice social commentary running through it the film doesn't do anything with it at all & quickly jettisons it in favour of a standard psycho on the loose & the police who are tracking him down type scenario which is nothing new & Douglas's character becomes like those he was initially targeting. By the time Douglas is using bazooka rocket launchers to blow freeway construction sites up the film has run out of steam & feels like it's forgotten it's own purpose. The ending where Douglas suddenly realises he has become the bad guy would have been good if the film had maintained it's attack on consumerism & petty law making but it doesn't so it isn't.Director Schumacher does alright, he keeps things moving along I suppose & there are some funny moments together with the more violent ones. I wouldn't call Falling Down an action flick but there are a few set-pieces here. The film starts out so well I'm not sure what happened to it but somewhere along the line it loses it's initial appeal. There's some violence, someone is stabbed in the shoulder, there's a drive by shooting, people are beaten with baseball bats & a construction site is blown up. The film also has racist overtones, Douglas comments on the Korean shop owner not being able to speak proper English as he smashes his shop up, all the gun wielding gangs are of Mexican origin, there's anti gay dialogue, one character is a Nazi who hates gays, blacks & foreigners, the homeless are portrayed as aggressive lying beggars & Douglas has a rant about the rich at the end in which he lets someone die because he's playing golf.Technically the film is very good with on location L.A. shooting, it certainly has that big budget look about it & it has high production values. The IMDb says that Falling Down was filmed between 29th April & 4th May 1992, so the IMDb are saying Falling Down was shot in a week! I think they need to find more reliable sources... The acting is OK, Douglas is alright as the anti-hero while Duvall is alright as the cop tracking him down.Falling Down could have been a classic had it been consistent throughout, as it is it's still an entertaining film with a dark humorous streak that I liked. It's a good film for sure but it could have been even better.

But in any case Falling Down is still a good film with a good performance by Douglas as D-Fens who plays a laid-off Government Defence worker who gets up ever day for work except there is no work to go to. He feels pushed aside by society that he says he helped protect and one hot summer day on the LA freeway he finally breaks down and abandons his car and walks away. After he does this he comes across many different kinds of people from all walks of life from a Korean store owner, a Neo-Nazi military surplus store owner, a bum in a park looking for money, Mexican gang-bangers,grumpy road construction workers, rude workers in a fast food restaurant and a ex-wife that nags him and will not let him see his only daughter. All of these people D-Fens encounters throughout the film and after each encounter he looses it more and more. We feel and understand his frustration at a society that moves too fast, is way too tolerant on criminals, where English is becoming a second language in America, illegal immigration overrunning our cities, deadbeats who don't want to work and where just basic manners are all but forgotten. We cheer him on for example when he trashes the Korean man's store cause he was being overpriced for a can of soda or when he shoots one of the scum-bad gang bangers. We come to identify with him and his outrage and we understand what pushed him over the edge.Robert Duvall plays the cop who is close to retiring but the case of D-Fens gets his attention and so he stays on to catch the man that is running amok in the city. In a way Duvall is a lot like D-Fens who has become numb to what is happening around him and how society is changing but you feel he has learned to live with it and play the game. I will not give the ending away except to say that there is a show-down between Duvall and D-Fens at the end that was disappointing.The problem I have with this film is that at times it did not take itself serious enough and as a result it became a bit silly in a few scenes. An example is when D-Fens gets his hands on a rocket launcher and finds himself in a position that he decides to use it. He does not know how and so a young boy who just so happens to be passing by shows him how its done. Unbelievable and it just took some of the Punch out of the film.But besides that this film does make you think about where we are as a society, and just how lose a canon we all can be and what we are able to deal with. Most if us do deal with it in frustration and are able to go about our daily lives. As Duvall's character does. Some however like D-Fens are the loose canons that can't.

Michael Douglas plays Bill D-FENS Foster, a quiet, passive, seemingly decent man whose desire to see his daughter on her birthday begins to unravel into an urban journey of violence and madness. The film touches on social commentary, showing how civility and decency can be ripped out of a common man by an American society that is rude, greedy, predatory, and violent. Foster, the protagonist, has taken and bottled the slights for too long. Armed to the teeth, (completely by circumstance and not by premeditation), he takes matters into his own hands. It's an interesting twist, how the super straight Foster has to become an unstable, gun-toting nutjob in order to walk down the street unmolested, to be treated with courtesy at a fast food restaurant, or to buy a can of soda without being ripped off. In this way, the film touches a raw nerve with the average American, exploring the rage that flows like an undercurrent from a frequently cheated populace.Robert Duvall plays a detective, a mirror character to Foster, who shares the same desires for civility, courtesy, and respect in an increasingly uncivilized world. Duvall's quest is simply to get out of the game, to retire from the police force with his sanity intact before he too is pushed too far.By the end, Duvall and Douglas are pushed into an inevitable showdown. The sympathy that the film has built for Foster is then thrown out, as he is revealed for what he is, a failure of a man on what amounts to be little more than a violent temper tantrum. The film's early power seems drained away by this revelation and the audience is left feeling cheated and exploited. Instead of standing for decency and justice, Foster is ultimately revealed as a weakling and a coward. He says, So I'm the bad guy? without ever realizing why. It's a dissatisfying end after such an interesting and powerful start. It's a shame that the film raises interesting questions without having the stomach to tackle any of the answers.

I remember watching FALLING DOWN in a theater the day it was released and I've seen it several times since then and each time I get down viewing it I have the same love-hate feeling towards it. There's no question that the two leads give remarkable performances and there's no denying that there are some incredibly entertaining moments but at the same time this is one of the most confused, plot less and at times mixed-up films ever made. You have to put a lot of the blame on the screenplay as well as director Schumacher as neither one seem to know if they want to go for a flat out comedy or if they're doing some sort of social drama. Throughout the day, this rather nerdy character gets into one mess after another. Some are hilarious like when he goes after a Korean store owner who charges too much for his can drinks. We get other funny scenes including a restaurant who stopped serving breakfast too early. These films are very funny as we get an oddball carrying a variety of weapons and usually overreacting to everything. Then we have a lot darker moments and most of them dealing with the character pretty much stalking his wife (Barbara Hershey) and daughter. These scenes are shot extremely dark and Douglas is so great as these creep and Hershey is so great at being terrified that these scenes really go against many of the earlier scenes. There's another subplot with Duvall being haunted by his ill wife and dead daughter, which again add more dark moments. No matter how many times I watch this film I'm still not quite certain what the screenplay was going for or if perhaps the studio or director just got cold feet and didn't go all out with the material. I think you could lump this movie in with films like DEATH WISH and even TAXI DRIVER but both of those films had something to say but this one here appears to be rather brain dead. Is there a message to be found here? I personally don't see one. I just see someone who finally breaks and crosses the line with his craziness. What makes the film a must-see are the performances especially the two leads. Douglas was always playing very strong men so it was great seeing him play someone rather weak. I thought the actor did a terrific job at bringing this character to life as he can perfectly handle the comic bits but he's also quite creepy during the darker moments. Duvall, one of the greatest character actors in history, is also terrific simply because of how calm, cool and collective he plays his part. There are several scenes here where the character must baby other characters and I thought the way Duvall did it was quite unusual and it was done in a way most actors never would have thought about playing it but he makes it work. Hershey is also extremely good in her scenes as are the rest of the supporting players. FALLING DOWN has been called a masterpiece by many while others have called it a complete disaster. I wouldn't lean towards either but I think it's safe to say that with the performances and a better story it could have been something a lot more special. The story, as it is, has so many problems but when it's on the film is extremely strong and there's no denying that the movie is incredibly entertaining from start to finish. I just wish I knew what they were thinking and trying.

Foster is fed up with all of 1990s' travails, including traffic jams, high prices, and the general malaise of a society that isn't living up to the false promises provided by a media that tend to romanticize the past rather than report it.  He goes on a one-man rampage to try to right this wrong, highlighted by a speech inside of a small store where he declares that he wants all the prices to be what they were in 1964.  He also gets more than a little upset when, inside of a fast-food joint, he is told that he cannot eat breakfast because he has arrived just a few minutes after they stopped serving breakfast.These are clever plot ideas that the American Everyman can identify with. What we can't identify with, however, is the notion that given these frustrations, it's alright to pick up a high-powered weapon and start to shoot people.  This is where the movie goes wrong.  Sure, I hate sitting in traffic jams, and would love to simply abandon the car and start walking. Sure, I'd love to bring my childhood back with 1960s' prices.  And I'd love to give the McDonald's manager a piece of my mind because I missed his artificial deadline for breakfast (I'm hungry, dammit!  I want to give you my money so you can serve me breakfast!  What's wrong with that?).But I, and I daresay most people would not resort to gun-toting violence as Douglas does.  As he starts to pick off people and destroy property, my ability to identify with his character quickly waned.  By the middle of the movie, he had become just another movie psycho that I didn't care about.One scene that goes terribly wrong is in the fast-food restaurant, where Douglas has just missed the breakfast deadline.  This could have been a funny, perceptive scene, holding a mirror up to a silly society that says you can't have breakfast after a certain time.  But once the violent element comes in, it's no longer funny, it's sick.  And it's all the more sick since at the time the movie was made, the country had had a rash of shootings where gunmen indiscriminately walked into McDonald's restaurants and killed people, including children.  The filmmakers should have known better.(One other minor point throughout the movie, Foster is identified only as D-FENS, which is the name on his vanity plate (he works for the defense industry).  It turns him into a faceless, non-human persona, which fits his character and adds a bit of poetry to the screenplay.  But by the end of the movie, he is being called by his real name. Roger Ebert incorrectly reported that throughout the entire movie he is only referred to as D-FENS.  It should have been that way.)Falling Down has a good premise; it could have been a great sociological study of American society. But because I couldn't care about the Douglas character, it became just another banal shoot-em-up flick with a pseudo-tragic ending.

Is it any wonder that Falling Down's director went on to make Batman and Robin? What has the potential to be an insightful film is strangled by patronising unsubtlety and jarring comic setpieces.Michael Douglas (is that ever a good idea?) plays the lead, a sacked white collar worker who's on a rampage because he's charged 85 cents for a Coke and can't order breakfast in a pseudo-McDonalds three minutes past the deadline. Robert Duvall, in probably the least of his performances, plays a policeman so unliked even his close personal colleagues call him Prendergast. His disenchanted, slightly racist attitudes are used as a counterpoint to Douglas'. Or at least they would be if the characters were more than two-dimensional sketches.The narrative moves along in fits and starts, with an awkward structure. It's text takes in diatribes against minorities and the American dream, giving it a responsibility to portray those issues effectively. However, what should have been an intense, dark thriller is given way to forced ironic juxtaposition. Take the scene in the restaurant. Douglas, ranting against having to call the service staff by their first names, as dictated by their badges, produces a gun. Well, says an assistant, you can call me Miss Folsam if you want to. Some people probably find that kind of thing very amusing, but with that one sentence you've instantly lost any credibility the scene had; worse than that, you've broken the fourth wall. For no-one facing a gunman would say such a thing, the whole scene is played for laughs, and so you're instantly taken out of the reality of the picture and reminded that what you're watching is just a film.Other irritating moments abound, like the moment where Douglas cannot operate a bazooka. So a small boy comes along and nonchalantly tells him how to do so, with a shrug of the shoulders and a I saw it on TV. Okay, Shoe Maker is making a point that children are exposed to violence (Though as this film has more than it's fair share, he's lobbing rocks from a greenhouse), but does he have to do it so heavy-handedly? Every single plot point is rammed home, from the Korean guy who knocks over a tray full of mini American flags, to the financially unviable protestor to the road workers. Worst of all, the concept that the lead may have right-wing tendencies is never dealt with adequately, merely used as a plot device to move Douglas from disaster to disaster, it's implications unresolved.And can someone tell me how, when he's watching that video of his wife and kid and pauses it, then legs it out of the house, how come for the end of the film it's begun to play again, ten minutes earlier on in the tape? Does that video have a special rewind ten minutes then play switch??? Only in the final confrontation between Duvall and Douglas do we achieve anything approaching a form of emotional resonance. But it's too little too late, a last dying gasp from a lazy irresponsible film.

I had a preconceived notion that this film would be one of those great pieces that had fallen by the wayside over the years, perhaps because its subject matter and overall tone were a bit too unique for the average moviegoer. This was before I found out who directed, however. The first scene of the movie, a well-edited sequence that does a great job of establishing the claustrophobic world that manages to get the better of William Foster, upheld my initial expectations for the movie. And I did enjoy the various situations in which Douglas finally stands up for himself where he would normally back down (I just want some breakfast.). The rest of the film, however, tended to disappoint. For one, the entire idea of Michael Douglas' character stalking his estranged wife and child seemed very clich√©d and detracted from the movie's ability to explore William Foster as a unique individual and not simply one more one-dimensional, Hollywood-safe psychotic. Adding to this disappointment was the continued involvement of the police department in the entire affair. I would have much rather seen more time focused on William and taken away from Duvall's character's plight as he tracks a potential killer on his last day before retirement. I came to see the misunderstood individual and to learn something about him, and not simply to watch as the good cop solves everything. The conclusion offers no further creativity and simply continues on the film's path of mediocrity and blandness, further solidifying its status as a potentially great story severely damaged by the director's willingness to stoop to tired ideas and clich√©d characters.

I find it racist, however, because it fails to target the film's hero as a perpetrator who refuses to acknowledge his own white privileges; a perpetrator who honestly believes that HE (as a representative of the American ideal of a middle-class, white male) is the target of brutal racism from the racially marginalized.  This film attempts to perpetuate the notion that the American norm is indeed a middle-class white male, and that the tradition of this ideal is being compromised by ethnic diversity, implying that whites are the new social victims.`Falling Down has been widely reviewed as an Everyman tale and D-Fens characterized as 'Joe Normal', 'average citizen', 'universal hero', or simply 'all of us' (Carol Clover 8).  This is particularly relevant in that each phrase relates to the notion of unmarked terms.  White privilege is defined by having access to these terms (i.e. `ordinary', `normal', or simply `American').  This `universal hero' concept, though, is particularly frightening.  One aspect which is so dangerous about the movie Falling Down is the audience reception of white males who see D-Fens as `patriotic.' Many audience members closely identify with D-Fens's actions, or at least the motivation behind them.  The director himself, Joel Schumacher, also contends, `This is not a bad guy, but he's had it' (Clover 7).  Even the blurb on the cover `appears to lend moral endorsement to the actions of the central character 'The adventures of an ordinary man at war with the everyday world' (Gabriel 130).  And this is precisely how many moviegoers viewed D-Fens, as an `ordinary man' who is justified in fighting back as a victim.This perception of D-Fens as a victim is a result of several factors. Casting lent a hand to introducing `yet another oppressed white male,' as Michael Douglas had recently finished Fatal Attraction and Basic Instinct (Gabriel 131).  Most importantly, however, is D-Fens's series of adventures through L.A., and the social, racial lens through which Schumacher presented them.This lens is one based on sympathy for D-Fens's character (as implied by Schumacher's afore-mentioned statement) as opposed to the people he encounters.  `Where audiences might be expected to empathize with D-Fens's adversaries, an 'allegiance switch' is contained, both by the use of humor and by restricting audiences' access primarily to one point of view' (Gabriel 135).An early scene which takes place in a small grocery store owned by a Korean immigrant sets the stage for D-Fens's first encounter.  John Gabriel's interviewees (i.e. select audience members) sympathized with D-Fens when he could not successfully get change from the Korean owner without buying an `overpriced' soda (Gabriel 135).  D-Fens is outraged at the Korean's `self-righteous overcharging' and takes a bat to his store, shouting ignorant babble about the Korean `invading his country' and so on (Clover 8).  In U.S. theaters this was reportedly met with shouts and applause from white males.  Yet the victim, for having to pay 35 cents more than expected for a soda, is not the hardworking Korean grocer, but rather the white, middle-class vandal.D-Fens is also presented as innocent in a future episode of the film, in which D-Fens meets with the owner of an army surplus salesman named Nick. A `homophobic, racist, anti-environmental, misogynist neo-Nazi,' Nick hides D-Fens when the police come their way in search of him (Clover 8).  Here D-Fens is set up perfectly to regain any camaraderie with the audience members that may have been lost after the Korean store incident.  When Nick's racist and bigoted attitudes are revealed, D-Fens calls him a `sick a**hole' and shoots him.  For D-Fens to kill the neo-Nazi, sweeping the path for democracy and justice, he is comparatively presented as the patriotic hero, even despite his earlier faults.  `By locating genocidal viciousness and insanity in the neo-Nazi (and indeed having D-Fens kill him, moralizing about freedom of speech as he does so) the film can define D-Fens as your average short-tempered neighbor who just happened to break one day' (Clover 8).  In other words, although the incident with the Korean grocer may have exposed D-Fens's racism, the incident with the neo-Nazi served to redeem him and present him once again as `the good guy.'The very elusive and `invisible' subject of whiteness is imperative in racial discourse.  As Carol Clover describes, `It is the great unmarked or default category of western culture, the one that never needed to define itself, the standard against which other categories have calculated their difference' (Clover 9).  For studies in race to further social progress, this notion must be annihilated, thus revealing whiteness as an ethnicity no different than any other.  If this can be accomplished, than the prevalence of white privilege can be broken down, as it should.  In closing, it's important to realize that the inherent problem in Falling Down, and indeed the tradition which characterizes most of the media, is not that it recognizes whites as social victims, but that it fails to recognize those innumerable privileges with which whites are bestowed each day for no other reason than being white.Now I don't consider myself a social commentator by any stretch.  I'm just a college student who has read a few articles on this subject.  I suggest, however, that before people praise this film any further, they read through the following sourcesBerger, Maurice.

But the dream has been a temper tantrum for so long, that it hardly matters.Perhaps this could have worked even with just Nic Cage, with his intuitive affinity for self-mockery and the grandiose (compare this to Vampire's Kiss, an early yuppie version of American Psycho). Michael Douglas has the face but he doesn't have the histrionics to pull it off, he's as square as Schumacher.

I mean all my friends seemed to like it but I just found it lame and rather boring. It had heaps of potential, man slowly goes crazy in middle of busy town with base ball bat and guns, but it didn't seem to go anywhere. I found it extremely frustrating for that the fact that it slowly built up, through Mr Douglas starting out with a base ball bat going up to him getting a bag full of guns and even a rocket launcher, but then before it could turn into a blood thirsty, all action shoot out it just ended. There was no going back to the brothel with a collection of carefully concealed guns as in Taxi Driver. Or a say hello to my little friend style shoot out as in Scarface. It just ended. They also had some of the most stupid action scenes ever put to film, Mr Douglas firing a rocket launcher down a sewer comes to mind, which brings the whole level of the film right down from serious hard hitting drama to silly, unbelievable nonsense. This is by far the best film from Joel Schumacher but bearing in mind his other films include Batman and Robin that really isn't saying much.

The film ambiguously combined an appeal to the audience's vigilante instincts with a desperate portrait of a man undergoing mental disintegration. Joel Schumacher attempts to scale similar ground in 'Falling Down', but unfortunately, fails miserably in this disastrous mess of a film. Michael Douglas' character is more completely (but less explicably, and also less believably) deranged than Robert de Niro was in Scorcese's movie; yet the film tries to balance this by presenting him almost as an American everyman driven to distraction by incessant provocation. This mad-but justified combo really doesn't work, but it's not the film's only failing. The sheer number of people who make Douglas' day strains credibility he can't talk to anyone without them insulting him, and most of the people he kills conveniently turn out be holding weapons he can take with him to use on the next punk to cross his path. After a clich√©d depiction of the violent inner city borders on racism, the film clumsily attempts to redress this by having Douglas set upon by a white supremacist as well. The movie's periodic transition into unsubtle comedy doesn't work either, the funniest thing being the way that, at some level, Schumacher seems to be expecting the audience to continue to take this drivel seriously. The psychology of the final showdown is also absurd, although it throws in a load of Hollywood sentimentality into the mix for good measure. Everything about this film reeks of a script written to fit a pre-defined (and derivative) concept, in a story that makes no organic sense. Schumacher has made at least one good film ('Tigerland'), and has also made plenty of mundane thrillers ('8mm', for example); but this is surely his most ridiculous movie.

Figured while I'm here I may as well pass comment...) It is rare that I stumble across a movie with absolutely no redeeming qualities whatsoever but this is one.Here Michael Douglas plays possibly the most dislikable character in the history of cinema, a pathetic racist yuppie bully, who having been charged to much for a can of coke (or something) decides to go on a murderous rampage because he's 40 years old and p****d off his life didn't work out as nice as it could have.Truly dreadful and offensive. Utter small-minded hatfull garbage. I can not believe I actually sat through this to the end (I guess I just wanted to see him inevitably die at the end).Do not rent/buy/tape this film. It is truly awful.0 out of 10 "}{"Title":"Someone owes me 2 hours","Date":"6 July 2001","Score":"6 out of 35 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Crime, Drama, Thriller","Review":"  This movie is just plain terrible.  It is such a propagandistic anti-gun, anti-defense, anti-white male movie.  It is slow, there is little action, and what little action there is is played in a way that makes the Douglas character seem like a psychotic racist, homophobic, moron.  It tries, at some weird level to make the Douglas character sympathetic, and 'falls down'.  Robert Duvall puts in what might be the worst performance of what is an otherwise stellar career, and Rachel Ticotin's character seems lost as a cop trying to do good.  Barbara Hershey plays her role of Douglas' estranged wife as a hysteric nut-case.This is just a really bad movie.  If it is the only thing on TV that night, read a book.

Unemployment and a failed marriage precipitate a mental collapse that takes Foster on a psychotic rampage, during which he terrorizes an assortment of clich√©d characters, almost none of whom have the means, ability, wit or gumption to defend themselves.The parade of feckless victims undermines the movies believability people simply are not the politically correct stereotypes portrayed in Falling Down. Most of the victims are portrayed broadly and ineffectively, except for a nice, albeit brief, turn by John Diehl as a father who behaves in a calm, nuanced manner that seems appropriate to the extreme situation.One of the movie's more galling conceits manifests itself at the Duvall character's farewell party, where the world-weary cop dutifully surrenders his pistol, reinforcing the filmmakers message of only active duty police should have guns. This ignores the fact that in the United States, almost all police officers own their own sidearms; only SWAT weapons such as MP 5s are departmental issue.This is preliminary to the movie's climax and final conceit, in which Foster's wife gets possession of Foster's gun - and promptly throws it in the ocean, as if it is a snake and not a practical means to protect herself. The film makers sacrifice a legitimate, common sense ending to their film in order to underscore their message that civilians are helpless victims. Most people, even those bereft of even a modicum of intelligence, would still do the common sense thing and hold onto the gun for self protection.The perpetrators of Falling Down, a poorly done agenda driven flick that advances the reductionist, dilettante (and quite frankly totalitarian) dogma of only the police should have guns, sacrifice the considerable talents of Michael Douglas and Robert Duvall on the altar of political correctness.
