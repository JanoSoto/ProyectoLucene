In fact, you'd have to look hard to find a more colorful film ever made.The Beatles characters are fun, spouting a number of good puns and inside jokes concerning lyrics from some of their past songs. The bad guys here, the Blue Meanies, are also fun to watch and really different from anything you've seen.This is wild stuff which can appeal to adults even more than kids. The only improvement I would have made would have been to shorten it a bit. Even at a fairly short 90 minutes, some could have been trimmed.The DVD is fine, except for the last 30 minutes when it gets grainy. However, the 5.1 surround sound more than makes up for that, affording the viewer to hear all these famous Beatles songs in a better format that surrounds you as a CD could never do.

Many people feel that this film is a miracle, and I have the same feeling, especially when I'm watching it breathlessly from the beginning to its end.Similar to the way the Beatles themselves have created many of their masterpieces, this film is the result of a controlled chaos. Lennon remarked that many of his imagery and lyrics were just conceived off the top of his head, which is precisely the thing that gives them the freshness and spontaneity we adore. Same is with the rich and fulfilling imagery of this film -- it is obviously an outcome of the 'shoot from the hip' approach. It sounds unbelievable, but the film's ending (the most brilliant piece of all), was thrown in during one hectic weekend! Knowing this, it is not surprising to learn that the principal artist who designed the look and feel of the Yellow Submarine movie, almost went blind after finishing it (he set a grueling schedule of sleeping only four hours every other night during the making of the film! -- it took him several years to regain his health)On a personal level, this film works as some kind of revelation for me. It is impossible to put it into words, but the film stirs the deepest, most contradictory emotions in me. It transcends space and time, and has the ability to bring me into the state where the regular, everyday thoughts do not apply. In that respect, it is as strong as the best Beatles songs.Many criticisms of this movie are sadly missing the point. To criticise the animation as being jerky and unrealistic amounts to criticising Picasso for not painting more photo-realistic canvases. Misses the point entirely. To criticise the understatement-laden dialogue is to miss the finer points of comedy, insisting on the Three Stooges slapstick only. To say that the story line is incoherent is to betray the sitcom-infested mind in the sad state of commercial-induced eating disorder.I must confess that I had approached the viewing of this film with a huge dose of skepticism. I thought it's going to look and feel lame, with a dated and naive hippy/psychedelia cliches. Boy, was I in for a shock!My rating 11 out of 10 "},{"Title":"Have some nasty medicine, your blueness.","Date":"16 May 2001","Score":"26 out of 30 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Animation, Adventure, Comedy","Review":"      Next to FANTASIA, YELLOW SUBMARINE is one the best animated feature films ever made.

The scene looks hastily slapped together,like something out  The Beatles cartoon series (which was hated by the real life Liverpool lads.  That's why they were originally not too thrilled with the announcement of this animated film.)

There are lots of Beatles in jokes, George's fascination with Indian music and John's fascination with scientific theories are lampooned, the Beatles' power is joked about (Nothing's Beatle Proof!) and poor old Ringo is just plain made fun of. The movie itself is arguably the most psychedelic ever made. The Beatles' descent into Pepperland is just one psychedelic scene after the other. The animation isn't great, but everything is just done so strange and fun that it becomes absolutely irresistible. The colors, landscapes, and creatures are just really different and vivid and vibrant. The songs are fit in very, very well (although Nowhere Man is undoubtedly the best sequence). Overall this works great as a musical or as an animated film, and there's definitely a lot of priceless, subtle dialog. I would name it one of the top 20 animated films of all time, really. Definitely worth watching, just because there simply isn't any movie like it.10/10 "},{"Title":"If you think music video started with MTV, see this film...","Date":"24 June 2005","Score":"25 out of 29 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Animation, Adventure, Comedy","Review":" Yellow Submarine is a great film but it's not because of the plot or even the whimsical, non-sequitur filled dialogue. Yellow Submarine works best as a series of loosely connected music videos that pre-date MTV by 12 years.If you grew up with MTV and you think that most music videos consist of 80's Hair-Metal bands in concert or rappers in hot tubs with women in bikinis, take a look at some of the musical numbers in Yellow Submarine.You have Only a Northern Song which is presented with Andy Warhol style pop-art images. Nowhere Man is a whimsical, trippy, rainbow colored cartoon. When I'm Sixty Four is illustrated by a Sesame Street style numerical countdown. Even All Together Now, for which The Beatles themselves actually appear on screen, contains little camera tricks and quick cut edits that are common tools of more recent music videos.The two best segments in the movie, in my opinion, are Eleanor Rigby and Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds. Eleanor Rigby uses black and white still photos of what is apparently Liverpool rotoscoped with occasional splashes of color to illustrate the dreariness of the lives of all the lonely people. The full-color rotoscoped images for Lucy, such as the can-can dancing chorus line and the horse running in the field, are beautiful.If you are a fan of The Beatles, great animation, or music video, this film is for you.

The idea that music may save the world and that the yellow submarine may be an escape from bleak, dull gray world is great. But even if we put this philosophizers aside, we view hilariously funny, colorful, brisk movie, with The Fab Four as a brilliant cast. And the lines! They are great, as when Ringo does exactly what the captain told him not to, or when The Nowhere Man starts his unforgettable gibberish, or when at the very end the real Bealtled appear, with all those quips and jokes.

Yellow Submarine is 130,000 frames (90min x 60sec x 24 frames/sec) of classical, pop, tribute (to earlier animation styles), and original art from Da Vinci to Warhol to Picasso to Popeye to unbridled hallucination, drawn to a best-of-Python screenplay of non-sequiturs, puns, and pokes at institutions from cold-war antagonists to (governor) Reagan's paranoid National Guard deployment against counterculturists.It's a feast for the senses and sensibilities. One can revel in the flashing, dancing colors and art styles--most of which well-shame anything Disney ever attempted and make today's phony-depth digital claptrap look like spilled esophageal reflux. The soundtrack is a condensed spectrum of the range with which Lennon/McCartney/Harrison composed, from deeply contemplative (Eleanor Rigby) to near-post-adolescent exuberance (Harrison's contributions) to silly-love-song filler showtunes (All Together Now). The dialog exchanges keep viewer's verbal senses on the edge of their seats. The theme undercurrents lightheartedly appeal nostalgically to those who were drawn to it in its theatrical release, historically to those who still wonder 'what the 60s was all about', without getting in the way of sheer artistic ebullience.If you're an adult, it helps to like animation and British-invasion-era music (or Mozart, Bach, Beethoven, Rodgers & Hammerstein, for that matter). If you're an adult watching it with your kids (there's nothing offensive), be prepared for them to groan at Disney/Pixar/Nickelodeon rubbish from then on, and say I want more of THAT!

However it's never looked better than when I finally saw it on DVD. The colors are finally more alive than they ever have been before! No black line film scratches or film jumps.As a boy,it was easy to get lost in this animated fantasy although the more mature underlying ideas were impossible to comprehend. The good versus evil is something most Saturday morning cartoons were made of and I waited eagerly for The Beatles and the people of Pepperland to defeat the very scary Blue Meanies.The animation is not Disney but as The Beatles themselves are noted for saying (on the DVD),if it had been a sticky-sweet Disney type film,they'd have wanted absolutely no part of it. The whole experience is bizarre,crazy,lampooning,farcical and many other verb or adjective you'd care to add. Especially in the building with many doors!There's even a serious tone with the addition of the song,Elanor Rigby,which plays over somewhat somber looking pictures of Liverpool and other sad things.In the DVD we get a previously edited scene where the guys are chased by the Meanies blue attack dogs (while Hey Bulldog plays over it.) This scene was done last and one can tell the animation here is not as good as the rest of the film is. This makes the scene seem slightly out of place with the rest. It's the only thing I can say about the film in a slightly un-positive light. Still,it doesn't affect my rating.Even though it's not the real Beatles talking,the quick quips and one liners are still funny as if John,Paul,George or Ringo had said them.I love when Ringo sings,Tiptoe through the meanies,when he and the others are sneaking through the dark while thousands of them are sleeping on the ground at their feet. The message of peace and All You Need Is Love may seem dated to some folks but without believing in that to some degree,one wouldn't be able to enjoy this movie. The film is a fun psychedelic fantasy but the idea of world peace and the futility of war and dominance are not.That idea alone is enough to rate Yellow Submarine 10 stars. I also rate it that for the incredible visual aspect of the closing,It's All Too Much number (written & sung mainly by George) and for the funny live action/sing-along of All Together Now at the end. The only one's I see not enjoying this film are those who have become cynical or think computer animation or Disney are the only acceptable formats.

She loved to read, watch the movies and listen to the music. Her favorite group for many years had been the Fab Four from Liverpool, The Beatles. Her wish was to collect one day all their Albums on LPs (yes, guys, it was that long ago). She had a dream to see her idols on the concert or in the movies but it was impossible. Their movies were not shown behind the iron curtain; as for the concert, they would love to come to her country but were not allowed. Then, one day, her mom told her that in the cinema close to their house, the retrospective of the British Animated Movies would be shown and she mentioned one of the titles, Yellow Submarine. The girl could not believe her ears. Could that be true? Did the yellow submarine travel many seas and make it to her city? Ringo, John, George, and Paul did not stuck in the sea of time; they emerged from a Vacuum Flask to Nowhere and with the little help of a Nowhere Man, Jeremy, they walked through the sea of holes that stopped their minds from wondering&#133; The girl had to find out if it was true.Next morning, skipping her college, she went to the theater. Looked like all college students of her city forgot about their lectures and labs, their tests and exams. Hundreds or maybe thousands of young people were waiting for the box office to open. The line was long but no one seemed to care &#150; smiles, laughs, lively conversations and arguments on who were the greatest and most talented of four could be overheard everywhere. The Beatles' voices from several portable recorders were floating above the crowd. The girl hated long lines (she hates them now, too) &#150; she had spent many hours that would combine into days and weeks of her life in lines. Unfortunately, they were the part of the reality in big city behind the iron curtain. There were two lines from that period of her life she still remembers fondly, though. First, a year before she waited for a ticket to Yellow Submarine, the world's most famous painting, Leonardo's Mona Lisa was brought to the girl's City's Museum of Art and for several months, the art lovers would wait for in line to see the most mysterious and celebrated smile ever captured on the canvas. Second, when she was the part of the young and energetic crowd waiting impatiently to sail with the Beatles on their ship and to help them to fight the Blue Meanies and their merciless Flying Glove.After several hours, she finally got her tickets and the movie started. She was completely charmed and overwhelmed from the very first scene Once upon a time, or maybe twice, there was an unearthly paradise called Pepperland. 80,000 leagues beneath the sea it lay, or lie. I'm not too sure. d. The colors &#150; bright and joyful. The whole movie universe felt like a bright and joyful dream produced by wild but very kind imagination. The Blue Meanies and the sea monsters that the fab four would have to fight looked like they were painted by Hieronymus Bosch in a playful and humorous mood. And then they were the songs &#150; the main attraction for the most of the viewers. Please keep in mind that Yellow Submarine was made in 1968 &#150; way before MTV and music videos but the way the songs were presented in the film, combined with the different sorts of animation, media, and cuts was pure art, pure genius, and pure joy to behold and listen to. Yellow Submarine, Hey Bulldog, Eleanor Rigby, All Together Now, Lucy In The Sky With Diamonds, All You Need Is Love, When I'm Sixty-Four, Nowhere Man, Only a Northern Song &#150; just to name few of them. The girl's favorite was Eleanor Rigby &#150; the combination of still black and white photographs of Liverpool that can be a lonely place on a Saturday night, and this is only Thursday morning with the color pictures of its citizens, all the lonely people &#150; where did they all come from? with the saddest music in the world was heartbreaking. She also loved When I'm Sixty Four &#150; the clever and funny illustration that one minute = 60 seconds is a pretty long time and Nowhere Man &#150; sitting in his Nowhere land, making all his nowhere plans for nobody...90 minutes had passed too fast. The Beatles won their battle with the Blue Meanies and returned music, happiness, and harmony to the inhabitants of Pepperland. It was time to go home but the girl did not want to. She wanted to stay on the magic yellow submarine and sail with the Beatles to where the sky is blue and grass is green and all you need is love.

Few G-rated animation features can have such appeal to all ages. Simply put, this is a masterpiece.Some have complained about the fact that The Beatles don't provide their own voices. Sure, the impersonators may not sound too much like the distinctive voices of the fab four, but you'll certainly overlook this within a minute or two of their appearances. As an animated film, its one of the most innovative ever. The combination of Salvador Dali landscapes and the pop-art of Peter Max works very well and is always fascinating to behold. This is as much an artistic achievement as animation could ever hope to make. Plus, as we all know, The Beatles wrote some of the best pop songs ever and the action on screen always fits perfectly with the soundtrack.

A far-away fable of a land where people are charming, where string quartets of seniors can sit in the park, flowers in bloom everywhere, butterflies drift by while children dance and play in the sunshine.You and I remember Pepperland, but it seems so very long ago. The songwriter Randy Newman puts it at Dayton Ohio, 1903. Long ago when things could grow, the air was clean and you could see, and folks was nice to you -- our Pepperland was a time when bandstand gazebos in public parks were put to use and the music there enjoyed by all.The Blue Meanies could not tolerate such open joy. It irked their sense of Order and Control. They sent in the Butterfly Stompers, Hidden Persuaders, Hungry Turks, and the 10 foot barristers they called the Apple Bonkers. Music, the open and shared music commons that gave the sense of community and culture, was collected up and locked away, guarded by dogs and goons, and the cultural heroes enclosed and silenced. Soon Pepperland too was silent, cold as stone, a tear in an eye here and there the only life to be found.But look around. This is not fiction.Everyone decries the decay of our civilization. Pollution, crime, vandalism, distrust, lockdowns in the schools, deadbolts on the doors, the homeless everywhere, endless demonstrations, lawyers and regulators at every turn. What happened? How did we get so bonked? As Soft Machine sang, Why are we sleeping?When I recruit players for our community band I tell them of Yellow Submarine. I remind them of that scene where the lads from Liverpool must tip-toe in the night, up past the guards and their dogs, their urgent mission up the hill to break into the sealed-up grand bandstand and the bandroom where the ancient brass-band gear of Sargeant Pepper's band is locked away.What happens next, I tell them, is what WE do. Our job, as community musicians, is to sustain Pepperland.Marshall Allen tells us, If you want a better world, you must make a better music. Once upon a time, our streets, our parks and our communities were filled with music. Music we made ourselves, music we made together, for ourselves and our neighbours.Yellow Submarine is a call to arms; you say you want a Revolution? Unlock the bandrooms, grab the old uniforms, STRIKE UP THE BAND! The Stompers, the Persuaders, the Barrister Bonkers, even the Blue Meanies themselves and their right-hand glovemen cannot stand up to the power of music to bring back the love and wake the people. We all want to change the world, but dig what good is revolution if you can't dance to it! By now you've already figured out I'm a huge fan of this film; it's been on my top-films since I saw it in the theatres the first time around. There is already powerful magic in this film, and this new re-release has done more magic of its own to bring the original vision into the twenty-first century. The sound is incredible, the colours astounding, and the added footage completely justified. Unless you are buried bonked under a mountain of green apples, and especially if you are, you should commit this film to memory, because THIS is how it is done, how we get out of our current societal mess, how we get back to where we once belonged.

The previous year had seen 'Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band' take the world by storm, and though 1967 ended on a bumpy note when the TV special 'Magical Mystery Tour' was raked over the coals by critics and audiences, the soundtrack to the same was very successful. No other rock band in the world could say their biggest flop to date spent two months at #1 and sold millions of copies. And somewhere in all this whirlwind of activity, practically ignored by the group, was a new feature film called 'Yellow Submarine.' It was to be a full-length cartoon, and the main reason The Beatles agreed to such an idea appears to be so they wouldn't have to be in it. The group had not enjoyed making 'Help!' and an animated film looked like the least painful way to fulfill their contractual obligation for a third movie. Others would provide their voices. The Beatles did agree to contribute four new songs, which they did, a bit grudgingly and half-heartedly. During their studio sessions at the time, if a song wasn't perceived as particularly worthwhile, a common comment was it will do for the film. Paul's was 'All Together Now,' a catchy though inconsequential sing-along that will never be mistaken for 'Hey Jude' or 'Yesterday.' George got the honor of doing TWO of the new songs (another sign that John & Paul didn't consider the project very important); 'It's All Too Much' and 'Only A Northern Song' are blasts of psychedelia that one doesn't hear very often these days. Far and away the best of the four new tunes is John's irresistible rocker, 'Hey Bulldog,' which wasn't even included in the film's original U.S. release. Fortunately, the writers, director, and artists responsible for actually creating 'Yellow Submarine' took the project a good deal more seriously and invested a lot of creativity and hard work into it, working under a tight deadline and budget. It turned out considerably better than probably anyone, certainly The Beatles themselves, expected it to. In fact, after seeing a rough first cut, the group decided to associate themselves more closely with the movie and filmed a brief appearance for the end. The tale of Old Fred and Blue Meanies and Pepperland and a Sea Of Holes traversed by a yellow submarine turned out to be a magical one, full of wonderful psychedelic images and funny dialogue, not to mention a soundtrack full of great Beatles tunes. It was fairly successful at the box office in its initial release but was rarely shown in the years afterward (continued interest culminated in a grand remastering and reissue in 1999, accompanied by a new 'songtrack' cd which includes nearly every song referenced in the film, unlike the original soundtrack, which had only the four new songs, 'Yellow Submarine,' and 'All You Need Is Love.') By the time the movie had its gala premiere in London, John, Paul, George, and Ringo were big fans and more than happy to attend and give it a properly fab send-off. In the years since, all have spoken fondly of it. It's fair to say that of all the projects The Beatles embarked upon in 1968, nothing brought them as much goodwill with as little effort on their part as the film 'Yellow Submarine.'

I was a young teenager at the time, and my father had brought my sister, brother, and me to Europe for our first visit. The picture was showing at a large cinema called the London Pavilion in the heart of Piccadilly Circus, and The Beatles themselves had attended the opening just a few days before. It was great to see this movie on a big screen with a good sound system. We loved the music and vivid colors. When we saw it again in Boston a few months later, we were angry that the Hey Bulldog number and a few other bits had been cut to reduce viewing time. I think the Eleanor Rigby number is best. The animated montage shown during the Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds number was partly taken from the 1933 Hollywood musical Dancing Lady and in 2006 I saw this old film on Turner Classic Movies, instantly bringing back memories of Yellow Submarine. The girl on the merry-go-round horse was none other than the leading actress Joan Crawford .... who was beautiful indeed in 1933, despite becoming a horror much later. No wonder John Lennon's character in the cartoon liked her so much in his psychedelic dream!

I'm a baby boomer (or at least I was born at the very tail end of the baby boom generation). I love the Beatles' music. I love surrealism. I love animation. Heck, I'm even an artist who paints primarily cartoonish, surreal works in bright colors. I'm a fan of the dada aesthetic. I like intentional silliness, absurdity and nonsense. In elementary school, I was obsessed with Edward Lear's Book of Nonsense. I'm still obsessed with Alice in Wonderland, The Wizard of Oz, Charlie and the Chocolate factory and so on. When I was a kid in the early 1970s, I can still vividly recall watching Yellow Submarine on broadcast television (I can't imagine NBC, ABC or CBS showing this during a prime time slot now) and being entranced by it. But I'm not sure if I've watched Yellow Submarine since then, and this time, it just didn't click with me.The story, which initially grew out of the lyrics of Yellow Submarine before incorporating ideas from other Beatles songs, begins in Pepperland, which is supposedly located deep beneath the sea, even though nothing there appears wet or underwater. Everything is fine in Pepperland at first, but it's not long before the neighboring Blue Meanies decide to attack Pepperland (it could have been that they just lived in another section--maybe the ghetto of Pepperland), primarily with green apple bombs, which has the result of freezing the Pepperland citizens and most importantly stopping their music. Fred (Lance Percival) manages to avoid the apple bombs--he's one of the only persons who remains unscathed, and upon the advice of the Mayor (Dick Emery), he sets off in Pepperland's Yellow Submarine to search for help in fighting the Blue Meanies. He ends up in Liverpool, and runs into Ringo first. Ringo recruits the rest of the Beatles, and they begin a series of misadventures as they work their way towards Pepperland in the Yellow Submarine to see what they can do.The animation is interesting conceptually. It's strongly psychedelic, of course, which means that it has a surrealist, dreamlike, hallucinatory logic behind it. The colors are bright and garish (which is a good quality to me). Although the animation is nicely varied stylistically, it often resembles a cross between a Peter Max painting and Joan Miro's work from the late 1920s on, with elements of Roger Dean landscapes thrown in for good measure (the Dean element probably wasn't an influence but an example of synchrony unless Dean happened to work on the film some--he was in London, in art school, in 1967).Given those characteristics, it's no surprise that I love the conceptual basis. However, the realization isn't quite so successful. The main sticking point for me, technically, was that I couldn't get over the glaringly obvious shortcuts continually taken to lessen the workload. There are segments that are just still pictures with maybe one tiny element animated. A lot of the animation consists of repeating segments. The Nowhere Man sequence is half-animated, the other half of the song is the first part run in reverse. Pieces of animation reappear throughout the film. Some scenes are just still pictures on a multi-plane system and motion arises only from the planes and camera moving at different rates and angles. Way too much of the film has the feel of super-low-budget Saturday morning cartoons.On the other hand, even that wouldn't have to sink the film. I'm a big Scooby-Doo fan and the cut-rate animation style from the early years actually has a kind of quirky charm to me.The problem was more a combination of factors. In Scooby-Doo, the focus is on characterization and story. The discount animation style plays second banana. Yellow Submarine doesn't have much in the way of characterization or a coherent, gripping story. The dialogue is purposefully nonsensical--often it's just a string of arbitrary puns, and The Beatles (whose dialogue is voiced by others) mostly mumble. Even some of the other characters are relatively unintelligible. Instead, we're asked to engage with the film on the more psychedelic level, based largely on the visuals. But the visuals weren't executed well enough to work for me, so I mostly found myself doing three things thinking Hey, this stuff is simple enough that I can figure out some basic animation techniques by watching it, intermittently watching my DVD counter while I wondered how long the film would go on, and waiting for the next Beatles song.The Beatles songs in the film are great, of course. Without them, I surely would have given the film an F (a 4 or below). The animation for the songs can even work occasionally, at least until you get to the laborious 1 &#150; 64 count on When I'm 64, which was like watching my DVD player's clock take over the television screen. If Yellow Submarine were just some loosely tied together music video I might have given it a higher score. A majority of the frames work as drawings/paintings for me, and I actually like quite a bit of the Blue Meanies animation, but on the whole, the film just didn't click. Maybe I wasn't in the mood for it. Maybe next time.

There will be mild spoilers aheadThe plot here is really kind of basic. In a far off land called Pepperland, the Blue Meanies have attacked because they hate music and happiness. They imprison Sgt. Pepper and his Lonely Hearts Club Band in a globe and subjugate the people to their rule. One man, Old Fred, flees in the Yellow Submarine to find help (as the Lord Mayor says, H is for Hurry, E is for Ergent, L is for Love me and P is for Please!).Fred takes the sub to Liverpool and more Beatles music, Eleanor Rigby next, coming upon Ringo walking alone and feeling unappreciated. Fred jabbers incoherently, but Ringo agrees to help and off we go to get the other three, each making an entrance amidst rater whimsical surroundings (lots of strangeness in the house they're in, with things playing with toys and odd things going on behind doors).Paul is last to arrive, completely up to speed on things and referring to Blue Meanies as though he knows what they are. The Beatles join Fred in the sub and proceed though various Seas which serve as musical cues as well as introducing the character of Jeremy Hillary Boob, a rather endearing if bombastic little man.En route to Pepperland, we meet monsters, Indians, the cavalry, a Sea of Holes (where Ringo winds up with a hole in me pocket literally. Jeremy is kidnapped by the Blue Meanies in the Sea of Holes, which gives way to the Sea of Green and Pepperland.Pepperland has lost all color and is now a sad, drab and gray place. The Beatles manage to make it to where the other band is imprisoned and Ringo uses the hole from his pocket to free them from the globe. Some of the best stuff happens in here, like a conversation between the head Blue Meanie and his toady Max. Max has some great lines here, mostly replies to questions. Jeremy, of all people, neutralizes the head Blue Meanie and the day is saved.There's a short live action bit with the real Beatles cutting up for the camera and ending the film by singing All Together Now.

There was some contention with the British distributors not liking the movie and it was in danger of being pulled from the cinemas. They reckoned it was confusing and no-one knew what if was supposed to be about. So as soon as it premiered in Liverpool my cousin and I went to see it immediately at the first-run cinema The Gaumont in Liiverpool City Centre. There it was paired with a gung-ho action movie called Mozambique and the sound was not up to standard for the start of the movie, but even these shortcomings could not detract from the fabulous experience of seeing this film. We knew all the Sgt Pepper songs off by heart and it seemed to encapsulate what the Beatles were all about at that moment in time. As for those cinema bosses in London well they were just blue meanies. Zoom to 1999 and the Liverpool re-release of the remastered film at the Philharmonic Hall. Tribute bands were playing outside the town hall and a character dressed as a Blue Meanie was walking around. I went to see the film again. It had survived all that the cinema bosses could throw at it and was louder and more colourful than ever. It is another revolutionally piece of cinema under the Beatles name and is an absolute animated classic.

Admittedly, I had no idea what to make of it. I knew nothing of '60s culture or of psychedelic artwork, and I CERTAINLY didn't know about the Beatles. The one thing I remember from the movie was the really strange, surreal story in which nothing made sense and my mind cracked a little.Now that said crack has expanded into a sizable fracture, I can tell you that Yellow Submarine is perhaps one of the greatest animated movies of all time. It tells a lot through its combination of magazine cutouts and elementary school style of art. The animation is strange and the characters' outlines are ever-shifting, like the animators completely disregarded what they drew for the previous frame and went solely on memory.The writing for this movie is EXCELLENT. Nearly every line of dialog spoken has a touch of comedy, if not more, and practically every joke is a bullseye. One of my all-time favorite zingers appears in this movie, when Ringo is accounting for what his friends are doing in the crazy apartment-hotel-flat that they may or may not live inOld Fred What are your friends doing here?Ringo Displaying.Old Fred Displaying wot?Ringo Displayin' around.BUM BUM BA-Dumb *TSS*.Even though it's not the Beatles who play themselves, the voice actors they got mimicked their inflections as perfectly as Maurice LaMarche mimicked Harold Ramis in The Real Ghostbusters. They changed the pitch of each voice a bit to help differentiate the Beatles from each other, even though George sounds nothing like he does in real life.The villains are&#x85; Crazy. The Chief Blue Meanie is kind of like a psychotic and totally out-of-his- mind Queen of Hearts from Disney's Alice in Wonderland (the GOOD Disney's Alice in Wonderland), and his henchman, Max, plays a good straight man to the Chief's obnoxious and high-pitched screaming. Oh, and Mel Blanc a.k.a. The Voice of Every Single Looney Tune EVER has an uncredited voice cameo as one of the Blue Meanies.And, of course, this movie has Beatles songs. My GOD does it have Beatles songs. Forget Beatles Rock Band if the Beatles' songs were psychedelic drugs, THESE sequences would be what hallucinations would spring to mind while we experienced them. Not only do we have the four, count em' FOUR original songs written for the movie, as well as Yellow Submarine and the greatest rendition of All You Need is Love ever recorded, but we also have renditions of Eleanor Rigby, When I'm Sixty-Four, Sergeant Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band, Nowhere Man, and Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds, though not necessarily in that order.Overall, I'd recommend getting into the spirit of the Beatles before watching this movie. Speaking as someone who knew nothing about the Beatles when he watched it, this movie actually made me like the Beatles LESS due to the fact that I didn't understand them. But if you're a person who loves the Beatles and hates whenever American Idol and the X Factor butchers one of their songs, then this movie will please you to know end.All together now...

He said that he had the unfortunate pleasure of seeing this movie and that if one wants to see a bizarre movie then one should watch the art house film that was really weird, but at least he had a point. Coming from a guy that watches wrestling because it is brainless entertainment, I don't put much credence on his opinions. If he were to be more consistent in his comments, and maybe even learn to appreciate some of the finer points in movies then it would be much better and I would probably take his opinions more seriously.Anyway, this movie is about a guy, Old Fred, who flees Pepper Land when it is attacked by the Blue Meanies. He flees in a Yellow Submarine and enlists the Beatles to help him free Pepperland. They then go on a bizarre journey back to Pepperland where they pick up a Nowhere Man because he looks lonely and defeat the Meanies by playing music.This is one weird animated feature, and for those who have seen Monty Python's flying circus, you will probably recognise the animation style. It is distinct and very rarely seen anywhere else. The movie is also serenaded by numerous songs of the Beatles, most likely off of their Sergeant Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band album, which I might end up getting one of these days. It actually reminds me of this guy that the only record he would play was Sergeant Peppers, and in the end everybody got really sick of it.The animation isn't all that consistent, as it takes a much different look during the song Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds, being a more artistic, yet not so definite, though the humans in this song seem to look more realistic and less animated.The interesting thing in the end is that they do not kill anybody. There is a bit of violence, as conflict defines literature, but the Big Blue Meanie in the end is forgiven and allowed to join in with the people of Pepperland. In the end their message is clearly make love, not war, and by showing a bit of love to everybody, then everything is solved. Great in theory, but in reality, in a world where everybody is out for themselves, impossible.Favourite Line Excuse me, would you believe me if I told you I was being followed by a Yellow Submarine?

I love the Beatles, and seeing this tribute to their music was fascinating. The songs were excellent, the animation was unusual (especially the unforgettable Elanor Rigby scene), and the characters were a lot of fun, including the eccentric Jeremy and the Chief Meanie. The dialogue itself is cheeky and has some very clever one-liners. Old Fred's retelling of the the Blue Meanie invasion to the Fab Four remains a highly comical dialogue, and the final battle is simply bizarre. This is, without a doubt, a '60's movie. The messages and the visuals give you an idea of what it was like to live in that time, bombarding the viewer with some of the strangest and most imaginative visuals I had seen at the time. While the Beatles didn't provide their voices for the movie (outside a brief cameo at the end), the voice actors did an excellent job imitating the groups' mannerisms.While it is said that the real journey is found in the travel, and not the destination, the actual trip to Pepperland takes up a huge majority of the story, providing a trip (in many senses of the word) that becomes less plot oriented and more of an animated musical showcase for the Beatles' music. While the music is excellent, this tends to make the pacing of the middle of the film drag significantly, becoming more an art piece than a story. In the closest comparison, Yellow Submarine becomes the Fantasia for the 1960's.Despite a few quibbles here and there, I've remained fond of Yellow Submarine, its art style, and especially its music. All in all, a delightful film for Beatles fans and animation enthusiasts who have a taste for films that remain unique.

To me, Yellow Submarine's story seems to be geared more to naive children, rather than to intelligent, thinking adults.One of this film's biggest downfalls was that a good number of The Beatles' songs that riddled the story (such as Eleanor Rigby, Nowhere Man, & When I'm 64) just didn't fit very well into its plot-line which focused on a crisis in Pepperland that was provoked by an all-out attack from the Blue Meanies.

Initial reports said that the Beatles themselves would provide their own character voices,however, aside from composing and performing the songs, the real Beatles participated only in the closing scene of the film, while their cartoon counterparts were voiced by other actors.The Blue Meanies take over Pepperland, draining it of all its color and music, firing anti-music missiles, bonking people with green apples, and turning the inhabitants to stone by way of the pointed finger of a giant white glove. As the only survivor, the Lord Admiral escapes in the yellow submarine and goes to London to enlist the help of the Beatles. The charming and innocent boys travel through strange worlds and meet bizarre characters, including the Nowhere Man. Several blissed-filled musical sequences and drug references later, the Beatles drive out the Blue Meanies and restore Pepperland to tranquility armed with only music, love, and witty remarks.The movie is an animated meandering journey filled with puns and dry British humor, where psychedelic music videos take precedent over any linear story. What little there is of a plot, however, concerns a vibrantly colored place called Pepperland that resembles the album cover for Sgt. Peppers Lonely Hearts Club Band come to life. The swirling animation is a mixture of pop-culture images and modern artistic styles brought loosely together with a naïve antiwar message and some clever political commentary.Also,the animated feature could be considered a family movie as it will definitely provide fun and entertainment to viewers of all ages.Also,it is characterized by a joyful blend of colorful animation and the music of the Beatles will delight anyone regardless of age.OFF TOPICThis film is was on limited released this year (May 2012).

The surreal aesthetic from this film is enough to make this movie have an everlasting place in the history of animation. As such, the viewer can just be carried away by the excellent songs and the imaginative musical numbers, with lots of humorous sequences, and few doses of metaphysics and spirituality proper to the time in which this movie was made. Such ideas could be curious for modern viewers, like for example, the idea that we all have a double somewhere in the world, or the existence of a perfect country, where all is happiness and music.All the characters from this movie were very good and interesting, such as Jeremy Hilary Boobor the leader of the Blue Meanies...The creativity from this film was clearly ahead of its time, and even when the modern viewers could consider the quality of the animation dated, the incredible imagination displayed by this film stands, even for modern standards, where there is a lot of weird animations, but none of them had the charm and beauty of the Yellow Submarine.

It's not everyday you find a musical that can be funny. Well, this is it. Yellow Submarine is the fourth Beatles movie, made in 1968. The story begins in Pepperland, an undersea haven for peace and music. That turned out to be a problem when the music-hating Blue Meanies launch an all-out assault, paralyzing all the inhabitants except for captain Fred, who sails to Liverpool in a Yellow Submarine, looking for Hurry-Ergent-Love me-Please Help. Meanwhile, a young drummer named Ringo wanders around, realizing nothing ever happens to him. He is then followed by the Sub, up to his house, where he agrees to help Fred. After tracking down his bandmates, John, George, and Paul, the fab four sets off into the sea. Facing some delays in the sea of time (they turn into old men!), They are pursued and eaten by a Vacuum Flask. Emerging in what appears to be... well, Nowhere, they meet a strange man, Jeremy The Booby, who fixes their sub, but it flies away. They then have to walk through the sea of holes to get to Pepperland, but along the way, Jeremy vanishes. Upon arrival at Pepperland, the Beatles must work their way through a barren wasteland to the bandstand and revive the locals with their music. They then fend off the Meanies by speading the music, laughter, and all-around peace, with a little help from the Booby. The Meanies give up and decide to become nicer people. Well, that's pretty much it. I give it 100 out of 5 stars.

Along the way they gain the assistance of Nowhere Man, who seems to be an incompetent `wet blanket' but later turns quite useful.Although the images are memorable, the animation is jerky; obviously not much money was spent on that aspect. Also the humour is a bit dated, though nostalgic. Still this is one of the best animated features of the 1960's.The style of cartooning is simple and vivid enough that children will like it immediately, but grown-ups will appreciate hearing Beatle-songs (eleven of them) they remember from their own youth, and savouring the many puns. The images (invented by Bohemian artist Heinz Edelmann) defined and illuminated the spirit of the times, and originated the psychedelic art that was so popular in the early 1970's.

I would consider this to be on of the best Beatles contributions.Yellow Submarine is an eccentric, psychedelic cartoon, so rich in color and humor and oddities that it is guaranteed to make your brain and eyeballs quite pliable. It is difinitively surrealistic. The story is about the Blue Meanies, a group of music-hating misanthropes who come to Pepperland to destroy it's citizens, those who are the music makers. An old captain hops aboard a yellow submarine, and along the way, picks up some notorious music makers, who help to save Pepperland from the wake of the Blue Meanies. I suppose the story closely resembles Homer's Oddessy, with the Beatles together matching Odysseus. They embark on quite a strange journey in search of Pepperland, and along the way, meet a whole slew of interesting creatures, friends and foes. Some of which, looks to be influenced by some of Dr. Suess's imaginative worlds. In this cartoon, you can see some Bakshi influence (the creator of American Pop, the pop art of Andy Warhol, as well as an animation style so prevalent of the early 60s. Moreover, if you recall the late 80s and early 90s commercials for Bubble Tape, Twizzlers, Carmello, or Skittles, you can see that those advertisements were influenced by the animation style of Yellow Submarine.I particularly love the Beatle's humorous dialogue, so subtle and spontaneous, which is not surprising, given the surrealistic atmosphere. Combined with an excellent accompanying soundtrack, this is quite an astonishing cartoon that was both quite ahead of it's time, and still maintains quite a large following. Although once the Beatles arrive in Pepperland, the movie tends to drag on as we await the rescue of Pepperland's citizens from the reign of the Blue Meanies, with more than enough musical numbers to pass the time. I think that, along with Bakshi's 'American Pop' and Béla Ternovszky's 'Cat City', this is one of the best animated features I have ever seen. Beatles fan or not, this is one cool cartoon.

Worse, the flick illustrates the basic tenets of the liberal-moonbat philosophy that life is a pastel dream; that All You Need Is Love; that anybody who harshes your buzz is a Blue Meanie; that pop music is the single most unifying force in the world; and that the answer, whatever the question may be, is YES.

The Beatles journey in the Yellow Submarine and on the way go through the Sea of Green, the Sea of Holes, and the Sea of Time, among other locations.My Critique This and the magnificent Sleeping Beauty are almost dead even on my list of the greatest of all animated films. Where as Sleeping Beauty used 70mm film and detailed art to create a definitive style, Yellow Submarine uses fantasy and absurd visuals to create an even more memorable style. One of the great things about this film is you notice something new everytime you watch it. Animated shows such as The Simpsons and Futurama owe a lot to Yellow Submarine in the way they use background to tell jokes you can only catch with an acute eye or freeze-frame. Long before MTV was airing music videos all shot in different styles and tones, Yellow Submarine was pioneering it. All of the roughly dozen songs in the film have a different feel. Elanor Rigby uses post-modernism. Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds uses Impressionism. When I'm Sixty Four cannibalizes numbers with art deco images. The only drawback is that the Beatles didn't supply their own voices. This doesn't really diminish it much though, considering the voice artists sound pretty dead on.

Nearly all films portray flower power as immoral and even violent. This includes apparent cult products like Easy Rider, Fritz the Cat, Strawberry Statement, and even Hair (the movie). Obviously the establishment had a strong disliking against the rebellious forces. In essence flower power was creative and sensual. And Yellow Submarine manages to grasp this atmosphere of hope and development. Certainly John Lennon and George Harrison themselves were icons of the kind-hearted attempt to revolutionize human relations. The resulting film is lovely albeit somewhat naive. The graceful state of Pepperland is overpowered by the emperor of the blue forces. The Supreme Counselor of Pepperland sends out the Yellow Submarine in order to get help. This help turns out to consist of the Beatles, and in particular their music. For the blue forces shrink at the sound of music. Their existence is based on the word No. Their main weapons are the flying gloves (note the resemblance to love), that of course contain fists and are capable of causing nuclear explosions. In the end the music prevails, and even elicits tears from the emperor of the blue meanies (sounds almost cute). Perhaps it helps, that there is a total lack of reds. Just green pastures, butterflies and free fruit. And shaking hands, the secret symbol of the reds. Still the separation between good and bad is less obvious than it seems. For on their quest the Beatles fraternize with Nowhere man, a cross-breed of a monkey and a blue soldier (isn't he a bit like you and me?). According to Lennon he is content, just let him be, and continue his circular movements. But the gentle Star adopts the creature. And during the liberation of Pepperland the Beatles discover copies of themselves, enclosed in a bowl of blue glass. It leads ever present Lennon into reflections about space and time. And life in general, naturally. Another ambiguous object (there are many) are the big green apples, that are used by both parties in order to put out of action the others. However, the Beatles act devoid of violence. They just appeal to common sense, resignation, perseverance, and humor. Undoubtedly this was the spirit and attitude of the overwhelming majority of the people involved in the flower power counterculture. It is nice to finally watch a film that says just that, and no more.

Happily, I'm more for the latter.The film begins with the happy world of Pepperland being bombarded by the music-hating Blue Meanies. An old man is the only one who manages to escape, so he sails off into Liverpool, with Pepperland's mystical Yellow Submarine, for help. There he finds the Fab Four (of course), living in a bizarre house bursting with... well... pretty much everything. I can't explain it, you'll have to watch it.They agree to help him save Pepperland, and thus a trippy, psychedelic adventure begins. They travel through different dimensions, all imaginative beyond words, and singing their classic songs through-out (a mix of old favourites and new ones recorded for the film, all of them brilliant as usual). The animation is fantastic and has a style of all its own, and some of the designs are truly outstanding.There are moments when the film just snaps and forgets it's at least supposed to coherently tell a story, but most of the film genuinely is a lot of fun. The writing is both tremendously clever and terribly groan- inducing (there are too many puns the Fab Four crack to count), but there's never an unimaginative moment or line.Famously, the Beatles only allowed Yellow Submarine to be made to complete their three-movie contract with United Artists, not even contributing their own voices (the animated Beatles were instead voiced by Paul Angelis, John Clive, Geoff Hughes and an uncredited Peter Batten, who all do a brilliant job), only adding four new songs to the film. However, they loved the first cut so much that they agreed to pop up at the end in a cameo, singing another round of All Together Now. It works brilliantly.Overall, Yellow Submarine is an endlessly imaginative adventure, with brilliantly original animation and fabulous musical numbers. It can be very hard to watch in places, but as a whole it's a pleasant and enjoyable adventure with the Fab Four. In its odd way, it's very almost perfect.

However, mostly, it's just a finally realized animated experience, with some good humor and a good rote storyline to be quite entertaining.The evil Blue Meanies come to take all the music and joy out of Pepperland, the happy-go-lucky paradise where music and love allows the populace to live in peace. Using freezing weapons and giant apples (think what that means with the Beatles' record label...) they quickly subjugate the entire populace save one man who manages to escape in a yellow submarine to go get help. After an extremely amazing animated sequence involving the song Eleanor Rigby and a surreal adventure in a labyrinthine mansion, he finds help in the form of our favorite quartet, John, Paul, George, and Ringo, who look suspiciously like the Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Heart Band that originally led Pepperland to paradise. The four heroes travel through alternating Universes that are basically long plays on logic and reason (and very funny and interesting at that), and then work together to bring love and joy back to Pepperland, using Beatles songs throughout.In a world of post-60s psychedelic revelation, this animation is still closer to The Phantom Tollbooth than Alice in Wonderland, or worse, Pink Floyd's The Wall. Most of it is just wordplay and puns, with a few messages about keeping an open mind and accepting one another thrown in. It's a great concept, and superbly realized especially with the various approaches to animation throughout (though the Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds bit gets almost as bizarre as interpretations of the song itself).--PolarisDiB "},{"Title":"The Greatest Rock n' Roll Adventure","Date":"1 September 2007","Score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Animation, Adventure, Comedy","Review":" The Beatles were easily the greatest rock and roll band of the 1960s.

They were in five films, Yellow Submarine is the fourth film (they didn't do the voices, but they appear at the end as themselves), and it's animated.The story is about The Beatles, their mission is to save the paradise of Pepperland beyond the Sea of Green from the music-hating Blue Meanies. The 88-minute film (I know the DVD says 90 minutes, that's because the 1999 restoration credits are 2 minutes long, the film is 88 minutes and the alternate version without the Hey Bulldog scene is 85 minutes) is filled with over 10 songs by The Beatles, including four new songs that were introduced on the film Only a Northern Song (a great song performed by Harrison), Hey Bulldog (which was shamefully cut from the versions released outside of Europe), All Together Now and It's All Too Much.The classic songs used in the movie are some of the greatest songs by the band Yellow Submarine, Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band, All You Need Is Love, When I'm Sixty-Four, Lucy In The Sky With Diamonds, Nowhere Man, Eleanor Rigby and pieces from A Day In The Life, With A Little Help From My Friends and Baby You're A Rich Man, Love You To and Think For Yourself.If you are a big fan of The Beatles, definitely check this out if you haven't. If you love animation and have not seen this, check it out. The animation in the film ranges from psychedelic visuals to photography. Plus, there is an epilogue by The Beatles themselves that adds to it. One small little thing I must mention is that, one some scenes, the songs' pitches are slowed down, because record players had a pitch control.

Though don't for a second think I mean that in a bad way &#150; take 'Yellow Submarine' for example, the real animated feature of its age; cheerfully pacifist, and a glorious little flick that defines freakiness at its most dazzling and far-out.One of the hardest things about being the true-blue Beatles fan I am is admitting that 'Yellow Submarine' was undoubtedly the greatest movie ever made in their name (though 'A Hard Day's Night' makes for a close second). This is because it was the Beatles movie in which they themselves had the least participation &#150; heck, if you thought it was really the Fab Four themselves churning out those Liverpudlian voice-overs, you were way off. That said, those impersonators don't do a bad job in the least &#150; I can watch and listen and think, 'Hey, that's not John', every now and then, but otherwise I'm impressed enough. Besides, any exaggeration on their part only helps to boost the whole cartoony feel, so, as George Harrison himself said, it's not a bad thing.True, there isn't really much in the way of a coherent storyline, but that hardly matters here. Much like Disney's 'Fantasia', this is a different kind of animated feature to the ones you're probably used to &#150; and the real asset of 'Yellow Submarine' comes in seeing just what they do with all those classic Beatles numbers on film. The selection of pre-existing songs (mostly from the Sgt Pepper period) is great, and their visual interpretations are a real treat from start to finish, allowing the inspired psychedelia to come alive with such vividness that even the sky's no limit. 'Eleanor Rigby' in particular gets the most beautiful music video you could imagine, while that notoriously-titled number 'Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds' is nothing short of mesmerising. No 'Strawberry Fields Forever', unfortunately, which would've been nice, but I suppose you can't have 'em all. The small handful of specially recorded songs also compliments the soundtrack nicely (I'm particularly fond of the self-aware 'Only a Northern Song') &#150; too bad none of them ever achieved the same classic status. For true Fab Four buffs, there are also countless references to other songs from their catalogue littered throughout the dialogue, while the Beatles themselves provide enough casual wit to keep you chuckling.At first glance, this may come across as a somewhat dated, flatly-animated fare, but believe me, when this gets going it can really dazzle you, sucking you into a lavish onslaught of colour and flower power before you know what's what. The 2D drawings in this flick prove themselves to be easily as cool and classy as anything in Pixar's visual canon. And, while the mere concept of all those Blue Meanies, Apple Throwers and four-headed bulldogs may intimidate the more down-to-earth viewers, in terms of the values this movie stands up for it's hard not to leave 'Yellow Submarine' without feeling enlightened, like a part of you deep down just wants to dance around and sing 'All You Need is Love' &#150; if everyone could feel that way at the same time then we'd have world peace for sure.So, there you have it &#150; the greatest movie the Beatles never made (well, to be fair they do appear as themselves in a brief live action sequence, but that was obviously just tacked on). Whatever impact this may have had on the people of its day, it still remains almost completely uneroded by the aging process, and a fresh and quirky marvel for the folk of the 21st century to enjoy. Strongly recommended, especially for Beatles fans, animation enthusiasts and anyone out there who can appreciate the true visual glory of 60s psychedelia.Grade A- "},{"Title":"magical mystery tour","Date":"26 May 2004","Score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Animation, Adventure, Comedy","Review":"  Here is what I know and how I feelYellow Submarine was supposedly conceived one day when Paul imagined Ringo being followed around by a yellow submarine and hence a new Bealtes tune was born.

Springfield (NOT Steinfield, NOT SPRINGSTEIN!!) tried this himself, it was a flop and he went on to become a vampire turned detective.The film of course featured several standard Beatle's tunes, plus a few more written for Northern Records. I still enjoy the energy of Hey Bulldog but my favorite is Only a Northern Song. The lyrics are lame, everything is a little off chord and the song admits it. This is John's wonderful sardonic wit at work saying he could get even richer off nothing more than recordings of Beatles bathroom sounds. Nearly as good as his peanuts spoof - happiness is a warm gun (bang bang, shoot shoot)RIP - John Lennon...The artistic style of the film was heavily influenced by a contemporary pop artist by the name of Peter Max. He is best known for doodle style line work and bold, primary colors. This design lives on today in most of the black and white color me items found in department stores. One uses felt tip markers to finish the work.The only other film combining pop rock N' roll and animation I can recall is the Heavy Metal Movie in 1981. Due to a bunch of copyright cat fighting, it is very rarely seen, which is quite unfortunate. Pepperland was sort of resurrected in another film by the name of Twice Upon a Time, very innovative in its cut and paste animation technique. This particular gender of alternate reality was last seen in Disney's film Monsters Inc..Although it was visually mesmerizing and acoustically entertaining, Yellow Submarine was about as lame as Northern Records as far as the plot went, a sort of black and white struggle between good and evil. All was not an entire loss though; the film shows a bit of subtlety in the fact the villain of the film is vanquished not by either theBeatles nor even Sg. Pepper - the Chief Blue Meanie is toppled by the least effectual character in the film, the boob, aka nowhere man. Does this suggest society's biggest lies are most vulnerable to the likes of ineffectual intellectuals? Ask Woody Allen - he knows.As far as feelings went, I saved them another decade for an animation named The Point. H. Neilson wrote the music and the Beatle's link was his friendship with John (the film pussycats) and the fact Ringo narrated this subtle pun on the meaning of the word point. The animation employed watercolors which lent an interesting but occasionally uneven nature to the animation. I can't say why this film was almost a religious experience for me other than the fact I was sixteen at the time. Roger L. Sieloff  "},{"Title":"It was good, the best is when the songs.

John & George don't even sound as high as their true voices (of there real selves at the end, and when they sing.) I don't understand why different guys did the speaking voices of the Beatles on this, instead of the real Beatles themselves doing it. Also, there were some songs on here where there wasn't as many stanzas, choruses, or finishing off interludes as the correct Beatles' songs did it, on their real albums and this Soundtrack. Only the songs Only a Northern Song, With a Little Help from my Friends, Think for Yourself, Baby, You're a rich Man, and All You Need is Love all did not finish off the ordinary way, or were cut somehow in different places of each ones. They were either only in parts, shortens, or mixes. And Only a Northern Song sounded in a different key in this movie than it did on the Soundtrack, and is said on the subtitles like Only a Normal Song, instead of Only a Northern Song. I wonder why? Now, I'm confused between the correct song title and what George said in that part of the chorus. I wonder Which one did he say? 'Normal' or 'Northern'? And which one should the correct song title be? But everything else pretty much finishes off the way it does on the albums, and is more correct.

A well-loved curiosity, Yellow Submarine deftly paints the mythical Beatles at the peak of their fame through unusually disinterested hands, without seeking approval for every artistic judgement, suffering undue interference. The film has therefore become a unique piece of art that snaps a remarkable moment in the history of popular culture.The bizarre mash of design and animation styles manages to form a fairly seamless whole, conveyed in 'Sesame Street'-style episodic chapters for the song-length attention spans of sacramental chemical abusers and (secondly) children. For example, the Only A Northern Song accompaniment is a technically accomplished and visually stimulating celebration of The Beatles' concurrent psychedelic mythology in beautiful, quasi-religious pop art; then, stylistically, it is gone never to return. Interestingly, the song itself, like many others of Harrison's, is spiky, angry and much underrated; it is presented here only by way of gruff dismissal by the band as mere padding for the soundtrack. The Beatles' loss was the film-makers' gain.The irreverence of the lads at their deadpan, press-conference best has survived the band's initial indifference to the project, and their wicked sense of humour has been stamped with uncanny accuracy on the script many brilliant and groan-inducing one-liners are let fly, with more Beatles lyrical in-jokes than are entirely necessary (Enough to fill the Albert Hall!).On that note, it's hard to imagine dreary Rolling Stones partisans getting excited about the whole affair, and the very idea may be logically dismissed as narratively abominable contractual filler - a position supported by the minimal involvement of The Beatles themselves. However, even John, Paul, George & Ringo's brief but enthusiastic appearance at the end of the story is a real joy and an unexpected treat in a movie where the spirit of the age bleeds out of every frame. It is a document.It's a tremendous pity that they couldn't find a use for Strawberry Fields Forever, or more of A Day In The Life than its climactic orchestral cacophony, rather than retreading lesser moments like When I'm Sixty-Four or All You Need Is Love (essentially Three Blind Mice in drag) - perhaps the most dated, over-familiar and unwelcome contribution to the project, upon which the salvation of Pepperland is unfortunately dependent. That aside, the soundtrack is irreversibly fused to the film in the minds of those who see it and embrace it.Infectious, nonsensical, whimsical and sometimes genuinely beautiful... many years from now, our children will be treasuring this film.On a corrective point, many people seem to be under the impression that the Hey Bulldog sequence has been slapped into the film from the cutting room floor for the DVD - this is not the case it has long been familiar to UK audiences.

Personally, I hope they're wrong, because if Shrek (nice in some scenes, but there are many more where the characters move as if they are computer games, especially the princess) and Final Fantasy (amazingly detailed but unconvincing movement and downright boring facial expressions, judged by either live-action or animation standards, and it takes too few chances to exhibit what animation is good for) are the wave of the future, than animation is just the walking dead.  I'm sure the style of animation in Yellow Submarine has been commented on before, but I thought I'd throw my two bits in before moving on to the important stuff.  First of all, even Disney's films had started to become cheaply animated and less than creative.  Secondly, non-Disney animation seemed to be more interested in Pop art style than Disney's realistic style or even the wacky Looney Tunes gags.  Just look at what came out within the next couple years--A Boy Named Charlie Brown (1969), Fritz the Cat (1972), and Heavy Traffic (1973).  Now, I'm not particularly knowledgeable about pop art nor am I a really big fan of it, but there's no denying that Yellow Submarine and these other films brought a freshness to animation.  Some of the sequences are absolutely amazing, even in this age of computer animation (Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds, Nowhere Man, and Only a Northern Song being my favorites).I like the Beatles, and Yellow Submarine includes some of my favorite songs (Yellow Submarine not being one of those).  However, for those who don't like the Beatles, this movie could very well be a chore.  Even I don't buy into the theme of the movie (which is pretty much expressed in the song, All you Need is Love), which allows for the happy ending (which, in my opinion, isn't a whole lot more convincing than a Care Bears movie).  What makes the movie work for me, as far as the non-musical moments are concerned, is the mixture of dry British humor and silly puns (some of which even draw groans from the characters themselves).

It contains a glorious cocktail of artistic styles and mediums ranging from pop-art to art nouveau. The two particular scenes that really appear to stand out are when 'Eleanor Rigby' is played and we are shown a grim and almost dystopian view of industrial Liverpool (great pop-art), and of course, the finale; which is literally bursting with colour and psychedelia (best wear your sunglasses!). George Harrison's 'It's all too much' coincides wonderfully with this.The score is well constructed and it's great to see that the film contains some of The Beatles earlier hits; 'Nowhere Man' (which appeared back in 1965 on the album 'Rubber Soul') for example. This is a treat for fans and those who are curious alike.It seems peculiar that The Beatles themselves didn't actually do the voices of their animated characters (their voices aren't overly authentic to the trained ear), but they do make a brief appearance at the end of the film. Yellow Submarine is also great to watch in groups. I had the opportunity to see it at local theatre and it was completely sold-out. It was very encouraging to see young children clapping along to the songs and dancing away along with their parents and other 'random' Beatles fanatics. It's simply great to see a film that has a simple beginning-middle-and-happy ending; there's nothing ambiguous here. The Beatles live on!

Sometimes there is just a pleasant ambiance and other times there are specific instruments or voices coming from the rear.  The disc also includes an informative commentary track by the film's line producer, John Coates. In addition, a supplementary sound track includes all the music, both songs and score, separated from the dialog and sound effects. A short documentary details the making of the film, and brief interviews give other insights into the production's background.That's just the extras. The film itself is immensely entertaining. The story is simple. The Beatles are enlisted by Capt. Fred to save Pepperland from oppression by the Blue Meanies. In their odyssey from London to Pepperland in the titled submarine they encounter all sorts of creatures and characters alongthe way. Then, of course, there's the marvelous music. The songs include several from the Sgt. Pepper album Sgt. Pepper, Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds, When I'm 64; others from their catalogue All You Need Is Love, Nowhere Man, Eleanor Rigby. Each song is a music video in itself, long before MTV and VH1. The voices of the Beatles are imitations in the dialog portions of the film. However, the songs are the originals and they will have you tapping your feet and singing along (you can use the optional English subtitles). Of course, it all has a happy ending.

So the Lord Mayor (Lance Percival) sends Young/Old Fred (Percival again) in a yellow submarine to get the band. John (John Clive), Paul (Geoffrey Hughes), Ringo (Paul Angelis) and George (Peter Batten) are now on a weird, wonderful, colourful, zany and over the top Alice in Wonderland type journey from Liverpool to Pepperland. In the end, the Blue Meanies make peace, and they all live happily ever after. Also starring the voices of Dick Emery. The Beatles (John Lennon, Paul McCartney, Ringo Starr and George Harrison) may not be voicing themselves, an I thought they were (the actors are very convincing), but they do sing all the sings in the film. A really wacky animated film, probably influenced by light drug use, songs include Yellow Submarine, All Together Now, All You Need Is Love, Eleanor Rigby, Hey Bulldog, It's All Too Much, Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds, March of the Blue Meanies, Nowhere Man, Pepperland, Pepperland Laid Waste, Sea of Holes, Sea of Monsters, Sea of Time, Sgt.

The addition of four new  songs bring back memories for me of those long summer car trips listening tothe Fab Four on tape. The magical world of Pepperland, land of music andbeauty, is that precious happy state of mind we all try to reach. The future of all  that is good is threatened, however, by the invasion of the Blue Meanies, a race  of happiness-hating beings, representing that depression that threatens ourown peace. And who can save the world of happiness from the slings andarrows of sadness? Why, John, Paul, George and Ringo, of course! Thisbeautifully metaphorical movie brings the Beatles out of the hoakiness of Help  and Hard Day's Night while keeping the Marx Bros. style of the Beatles' comedic  talents Ringo, the simple, woe-is-me comic relief, George, the detached,mystical hippy style meditator, John, the intelligent, smirking boy, and Paul, the  happy-go-lucky stage-performer. The addition of the little Nowhere Man is a  welcome addition, representing the silliness of the continuing search forknowledge while isolating oneself from the rest of the world. I, for one, was  surprised to find that these were not the actual Beatles' voices speaking. They  sound so much like them! But, fear not! The Fab Four show up in person to bid  us goodbye, and telling us to keep singing to chase away our everpresent blue  meanies! So, just don't think that these aren't the real Beatles speaking, they are  wonderful with their crisp, refreshing British humor in the style of such geniuses  as Lewis Carrol and Oscar Wilde.

Much like the odd quality of Monty Python's animation, the animation here is all completely quirky. Some things move, some don't, and some objects have things that they shouldn't have. It's all very hard to explain, but it can be compared to Monty Python by its pure comic irreverence.The silly plot has the magical land of Pepperland, where music is enjoyed by all and everything is groovy, being overtaken by the music-hating Blue Meanies. Young Fred (Lance Percival) is sent in a yellow submarine to find help. He finds John, Paul, George, and Ringo (who are not voiced by themselves), who accompany him throughout various seas and the entire world to get back down to Pepperland. Along the way, odd things happen, puns are thrown around, and they meet a Nowhere Man named Jeremy Hilary Boob, Ph.D (Dick Emery) who knows everything.As I refer back to David Lynch, there's a difference between enjoyable weird and just plain scary weird. While Lynch is scary weird, Yellow Submarine is just pure fun. There's no real story, everything that happens is really random, and it couldn't really be any better. The animation I found to be quite ahead of its time. The animation was so zany, so&#133;odd, that it's memorable.The whole movie had a real tongue-in-cheek feel to it. There are multiple puns, and much of the movie seems to be a parody. For instance, like many spy films, the yellow submarine has everything, and I mean everything, built into it. Of course, it's hard to take any movie where the bad guys are called Blue Meanies seriously, but that's a moot point.The music is just a big compiled bunch of The Beatles' hit songs, and many of them, such as `Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds', are just filler and don't really add anything else to it. I'm not a huge Beatles fan, but I know some of their songs, and I think about half of them were new to me. Sometimes they helped the movie, but oftentimes they just hindered. Not to say that they weren't enjoyable, but they were pretty worthless. Overall, if watching an animated movie that was obviously made while people were on drugs, then Yellow Submarine is your best bet.My rating 8/10Rated G.

Fred travels through time to earth to find Ringo out for a walk.  He follows Ringo back home and begs him for help.  Ringo agrees and rounds up the rest of the Beatles to return to Pepperland and challenge the Blue Meanies with joy and music.It has been many years since I have seen this film so I decided to revisit it.  The first obstacle I had to get over was my dislike for 60's psychedelic animation &#150; of which much of this film is made up of or aspires to.  I feel that it has dated very badly and that it is difficult to watch unless you accept that it is very much of it's time.  Once over that obstacle then there is much to enjoy.  The plot is crazy but (as with the animation) shows such great imaginations at work behind it.  There is much to enjoy visually &#150; even if it has become a psychedelic cliché of the sixties.The humour is very dry and matches the Beatles' wit in Hard Day's Night.  Although the Beatles themselves do not provide the spoken voices for their characters (until the end) their onscreen characters are still well done and convincing.  The music is the main pull I suspect and it has several Beatles hits that everyone will love.  Not being a major fan of theirs, there were songs that I didn't know &#150; but I still enjoyed these.The film's weakness is that it is very thin on substance as the focus was imagination.  As a result it does drag at times.  When the music is on then it is fine, when the Beatles are bantering then it is fine, however, at other times the stretches begin to show and the material isn't good enough to hold the attention.  Other than this flaw I did enjoy it despite not really liking all this hippy trippy stuff that is of the 60's and nothing more.Overall an enjoyable bit of animation.  Those who dislike the Beatles or dislike 60's animation will probably do best to avoid this but if that's your thing then there is plenty to enjoy here in this imaginative and witty film.

Most professional reviewers are convinced that this is a classic example of &#145;60s film-making, wallowing in its psychedelia and celebrating its disregard for narrative.  Let the film students think what they want (or what they're told); I couldn't care less how much of a symbol of its age it is.  For 99 of its 100 minutes, I was looking forward to the end credits.Finding something to complain about in this movie is like finding a needle in a really big stack of needles.  The design was ugly and repellent, and in places the animation was less fluid than a flicker-book with half its pages missing.  The basic idea was inventive, but its execution was so underdeveloped in some places and so ham-fisted in others that any good points are lost in the growing sense of boredom that should overwhelm the audience.  The acting is often terrible, the cast tend to mumble their lines, and most of them sound as bored and confused as I was.  The script is feeble, most of the dialogue is pointless, the jokes are rarely funny, and the wordplay is wince-inducing.The main problem is that it was written backwards.  Released in 1968, it takes songs from the Rubber Soul, Revolver and Sgt. Pepper albums, released two or three years earlier, and tries to fit them into the story.  They don't fit at all.  Old songs are given new, inappropriate meanings, where their lyrics are either ignored so they become pointless, or interpreted so literally that they become laughable.  We get Eleanor Rigby, and the only way the writers can fit it into the movie is to have Ringo say something like `Even Eleanor Rigby's life was more exciting than mine.'  To fit in When I'm Sixty-four, the Beatles travel through time and grow old.  By the second verse they're back to normal but that doesn't seem to make any difference.  The most laughable is the inclusion of Nowhere Man; they meet someone who lives in a place that is literally nowhere, and John says something like `There must be some way to describe him' before singing `He's a real nowhere man, living in his nowhere land...'  This, like most of the songs, is lip-synched so badly even Milli Vanilli would complain.Another fault is the desperate attempt to include lyrics as dialogue.  There are some awful examples; when they appear in a sea of holes, John says `This reminds me of Blackburn, Lancashire' while someone else says `these could fill the Albert Hall'.  These are just strained and pointless, and while the intention may have been to immerse us in the world of the Beatles and their music, it just makes the writers look like sycophantic know-it-alls.The new songs make no real impression, and some of the lyrics of All Together Now are so simplistic they reach banality, though it's saved by a catchy tune.  The old songs are great, but they always were, and if I want to hear them I'll play the albums and continue to avoid this over-rated mess of a movie.

Maybe not multiple times, but at least once.This bears saying because it IS kind of stupid, when you break it down to its bare elements. The idyllic English countryside fantasy-world of Pepperland has been taken over by the Blue Meanies, and only the Beatles can stop them. So it's a surreal but nonsensical journey from the Beatles' Liverpool to Pepperland, punctuated by a bunch of their songs which have very little to do with the story. Plus a handful of jokes which are painfully un-funny.This totally would be an embarrassingly trite cash-grab if not for the truly interesting and unique art direction, which really has nothing to do with the Beatles at all except for them both exploiting a psychedelic look. This Czech guy, Heinz Edelmann, designed everything with this neon-tubed, pop-art, minimalist look that really works.Even better are the weird images and effects that pop up, especially during the musical sequences. Like the Oscilloscope under the face-caricatures in Only a Northern Song, or the rotoscoped acrobats in Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds. I can see how many would find this all to be just artsy-fartsy nonsense, but for me it works. Even without any apparent underlying meaning, it somehow feels both whimsical and sad, in a good way.In summation, this movie is well-financed Outsider Art.

The Beatles don't so much as provide the voices for their animated counterparts, but Yellow Submarine, like the music that inspired it, has not only endured but gained in stature. Why? The plot is a barely-there concoction of some mystical never-never land being taken over by goofy baddies and requiring the rescue of four well-known lads from Liverpool. Most of the songs we see performed don't really advance the plot the way they should in musicals. The animation is often hectic or weird; Pixar-spoiled eyes may glaze over at much of what they see.Yet it all still packs a punch, because of its daft combination of surrealism and humor. Tone, too, like the early scene where we see the citizenry of an English city (London or Liverpool, not clear which) going through their gray daily rituals, mimicked absurdly, at times quite affectingly, in a series of set-piece animations performed with photographs of real people to the song Eleanor Rigby, a perfect marriage of sound and scene that sets the bar for the rest of the film. Embarrassing personal admission I always get a lump in my throat whenever I see that man bending down to pet the little dog that leans forward to reach him, the two never quite touching.Of course, the only thing missing from that is humor and the Beatles, both of which follow quickly when we see Ringo pursued by a yellow submarine (A suggestion to this effect to producer Al Brodax by John Lennon was apparently the seed of the film). The submarine captain, sole escapee from the now-Blue-Meanie-overrun domain of Pepperland, located many leagues under the sea, has come to enlist the help of some folks who can provide the only weapon Blue Meanies can't face Music.Some say the film suffers from the fact the Beatles don't do the voices. I used to think that, too. But the actual voice actors do an extremely good job, not so much approximating how each of the band members sounded but how they all sounded together, throwing up a veritable medley of puns and witticisms with breezy nonchalance. By this point, the real Beatles were drifting away from the state of togetherness they presented so effortlessly in their earlier movies, A Hard Day's Night and Help! Yes, this would have made more sense than shooting Magical Mystery Tour or following a bogus holy man to India, but would the real lads have put as much energy and passion to their performance as the voice actors did? I doubt it.What makes Yellow Submarine works is that it is a bit of a piffle, taking itself very lightly but invested with a certain deeper intelligence, in terms of its art scheme, composition, and dialogue, that reveals itself with multiple viewings. And there's so much eye candy and overall fun that one readily goes back to watch it over and over again Look, a school of whales. They look a little old for school.Yellow Submarine represented a great advance on several fronts, particularly animation (finding something kids and adults could both admire was supposed to be impossible, even at Disney) and the art of the music video. The Eleanor Rigby sequence is arresting, but there's other brilliant adaptations here showcasing Lucy In The Sky With Diamonds (rotoscoped dancers that move hypnotically to the melody), All Together Now, and, most amusingly, When I'm 64. The DVD released in the U.S. in 1998 restored a sequence us Americans never got to see before, where the Beatles dodge a multi-headed beast to the tune of one of the group's most obscure compositions, the raucous Hey Bulldog. It's another highlight.Though it has evolved from entertainment into a cultural touchstone today, Yellow Submarine remains an enjoyable, engaging, one-of-a-kind film. Sociologists will do well to study it, and after they've gone to bed, their children will probably sneak down to watch it for themselves. The Beatles' self-perpetuating legacy lives on.

That the movie has lush, striking colors and visuals, a range of originality (if I had seen it when I was a kid I could compare the experience to that of seeing Toy Story when it was first released), and includes musical interludes with some of the finest songs the Beatles produced in that period, the movie works very well for the parents as well as the kids.   Such songs include the title song, Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds, When I'm Sixty-Four, and Nowhere Man, which are great numbers, and Eleanor Rigby taking the cake.  But that brings me to the other audience, the one that remembers seeing the film for the first time in its initial release- perhaps under the influence of certain substances- and those in this generation who discover it for the first time and are NOT children.  Since Yellow Submarine is as much a musical/fantasy vehicle for the Beatles as it is a trippy, abstract art-film (in the later category it's a gem), it could be frustrating to those in the audience who find the animation TOO experimental and, shall I say, 60-ish.  And those who love the animation may not like the Beatles.

'Yellow Submarine' literally changed my life when I saw it for the first time at age 7. It broke the barriers for animation as a whole, and inspired studios other than Disney to make their own groundbreaking features.Made with a very low budget, 'Yellow Submarine' is made entirely from scratch. Years before CGI, which is horribly overused in animation these days. The colors and backgrounds are hand painted, and is far more glorious than anything a computer can do. The story to 'Yellow Submarine' is not elaborate, but wonderful in its own way. It's a message that love is much stronger than hate. Even though they're the living embodiment of hatred throughout most of the film, I adore the Blue Meanies for reasons I can't quite figure out. I love them more than The Beatles themselves in this film. Jeremy's also a favorite character of mine. He's just too cute, and his speaking in rhyme never fails to delight me.As for The Beatles, the real band members didn't voice their cartoon counterparts. But the other actors I think suit them even better in the movie. It gives them a more distinct feel I think. Though it would have been awesome if they had played rock instruments, the classic Beatle songs make this soundtrack better than any other. The Beatles always will be my favorite band of all time.If you're heavily into The Beatles or animation, don't pass up 'Yellow Submarine'! It's on the level of Woodstock and 'Easy Rider' when it comes to the importance of '60s culture.

Can you honestly imagine Robbie Williams, Madonna, or Oasis making a mad film like this? At the time, the beatles didn't care if it made money - they had enough after all. Can you imagine any popstar doing anything now for purely artistic reasons?The only people that come to mind are Blur, Radiohead and loads of unknown electronica artists - so , maybe I'm wrong.

Still, my mother's a Beatlemaniac and when I heard Yellow Submarine was coming out on DVD, I knew it would be perfect to buy her for Christmas.To make a long story short, I need to purchase another copy, as I've taken control of hers.Yellow Submarine is like a filmed dream.  If you try and make sense of it, you'll find yourself with a horrible headache, but if you suspend your doubt and go along with it, you'll find yourself enjoying it and even feeling as if it does make sense in a wierd way.  If it is a dream though, it's the most wonderful, uplifting one I've encountered.The animation can be simplistic (though other times amazing) but it's nonetheless extremely charming.  Indeed, this seems to be the case with most aspects of the film the puns groanworthy, the psychedelia dated along with the peace and love theme, the plot rediculous, but it all somehow forms a mix which is absolutely enchanting and loveable if you give it half a chance.Though it's certainly apropriate for all ages, younger children may find it overly long and confusing, and would probably enjoy watching only short bits of it and some members of the Pokemon set are likely to find it primitive, corny and boring, but older children, teenagers, and adults from all generations should all be able to enjoy and appreciate this unique work of art.And yes, thanks to the soundtrack, I've now listened to Beatles music with a new interest and outright love.

Mixing music with animation was very bid risk for Disney, both budget and audience wise.  However, FANTASIA was years ahead of it's time, and it doesn't get the credit that it deserves.  YELLOW SUBMARINE is the same way, however it came out at the right time, and that is why it was a success.  It's a extraordinary film that mixes pop art with music, and succeeds! YELLOW SUBMARINE is the story of a peaceful land called Pepperland, where there are flowers, singing birds, and music everywhere.  Then above Pepperland in the mountains are the Blue Meanines, who hate love, joy, and especially music.  The Blue Meanines attack and take over Pepperland, causing it to be dull, grey, and very very sad.  However, during the take over of Pepperland by the Meanies, the composer, Old Fred, escapes in a Yellow Submarine and seeks out help to save Pepperland. What better help than to get The Beatles.  The Beatles travel in the Yellow Submarine and go through the Seas of Time, Science, Monster, Holes, and more until they reach Pepperland, and try to save it. I'm going to be bias, I'm a HUGE Beatles fan, and I've enjoyed YELLOW SUBMARINE  since I first saw it 11 years ago, when MGM/UA released it on video for the first time.  I loved the songs, but I also enjoyed the witty one-lines and the cool animation.  I was surprised recently that it was reveled that each Beatles song has a different style of animation.  And for years I heard about the deleted song from the U.S. version of HEY BULLDOG.  I always wanted to obtain a U.K. copy of YELLOW SUBMARINE just to see that extra 3 mins. that American audiences didn't get to see. Now YELLOW SUBMARINE has finally been re-released on video and on DVD for the first time. After years of waiting, I was pleased to see the deleted sequence, it sort of makes sense between the The Beatles and Sgt. Pepper sub-plot, but it really doesn't effect the major plot.  What is also great about this re-release is first the digital remixing of the songs (they sound A LOT clearer and better, and I can't usually tell the difference of other remixes).  And the resoration of the color, the film looks a lot more colorful and brighter, and more like a psychidelic film, than a old film from the '60's. I have always enjoyed YELLOW SUBMARINE, and the new DVD/video re-release is a major must buy for Beatle or movie fans.

This is not just a cartoon for Beatles fans, although if you love the music you can sing along and enjoy, but is a convincing and surreal story in its own right, a marker of life in the sixties that many of us were not alive to see. The plot, of Blue Meanies versus Pepperland with the Beatles coming to the rescue, and encountering weird and wonderful monsters and No-Where Men along the way is captivating and enthralling, but without doubt, the sure energy and goodwill of the film just carries you inside it, so that before you realise it, you are singing along and having an emotional experience that leaves you breathless in the perfect ending which would have seemed too rediculous to have been made in any other film. In other words, this film is a lot more than a mere Beatles experience, and in fact seeing the Beatles actually there in the flesh at the end is almost an anticlimax, saved by the return to the final, world-uniting and enjoyable song.

It shows what a sheltered workshop animation has become (had already become, by the end of the 1960s - and I speak as a lover of animation).  Fans are so willing to accept the will for the deed.For instance the art direction is usually superb (and much more varied than I thought it would be), and it's what people who like the look of the film are enjoying; but the character animation often puts us off with its clumsiness.  I'm sure there are people out there who feel that this is striking below the belt after all, wasn't this a cheaply made film, and shouldn't it be judged as such?  Well - why?  We are members of an audience, people we are critics, not accountants.  The budget is none of our concern.  How would you feel if Caravaggio had hastily splashed paint on his canvas to give us an idea of the layout, while leaving out all the brush-stroke details because he was pressed for time and short of cash, so that we had to mentally reconstruct what his paintings ought to have looked like?  `Yellow Submarine' could have kept EXACTLY the same pretty look AND had good animation.  We should not settle for less.The EXTREMELY charitable reviews this film has got are due to its charm.  It has so much charm and so little of anything else - I wouldn't have thought this possible.  But the lack of everything else makes the experiencing of watching it a flat one.  The songs are great, of course.  There can be no rational doubt that the Beatles are the very best thing that happened to popular music in the second half of this century - possibly in the century as a whole, but in the first half it's harder to determine what's `popular' and what isn't.  Still, there aren't THAT many great songs, all things considered.  Given how shameless the film is in breaking out into song at the drop of a hat, one wonders why it doesn't break into song more often - the patches of `plot' that stretch out to the horizon while we wait for some music to interrupt them, can be quite tedious.The film could have done with a better script.  I know - AGAIN it sounds as if I'm striking below the belt.  But damn it all, I'm not asking for much.  It could have been every bit as sweet and surreal AND had a better script; so, again, why are we so willing to settle for less?  (And did it HAVE to be so hippy-trippy?)Oh, yes - more puns were needed.  If you're going to take the wordplay route then you have to go the full distance - otherwise you'll have a compromise between earnestness and flippancy that pleases no-one.Hell, watch it anyway.  Sweet, surreal, charming - these words all truly apply, even if it's also rather poor, unsatisfying, and just the teensiest bit dull.

The Beatles' were jumping on a bandwagon, of course. They didn't invent any of the Love messages; but they did give it all a publicity boost, and frankly, I feel the world is better off for it.
