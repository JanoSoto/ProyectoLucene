If this sounds vague to you, I'll tell you what it is. It's a great martial arts movie made in the era of Bloodsport, Kickboxer, King of Kickboxers, and such other similar films. For what it is, its a phenomenal movie. Great fight scenes, especially when Phillip Rhee is fighting as well as the Korean team, (the rest of the American team sucked, filled with bad actors like Eric Roberts.. who gives a sh!t about eric roberts, but I digress). Sure it was cheesy but what did you expect, an Oscar award winning movie, no, you go to see this for the mindless fun it gives you, just like Rocky IV that everyone mentioned in the comments, sure story wise Rocky IV wasn't the best, but I love the fights, the training, all of that... Its a fun movie.This is my all time favorite martial arts movie, along with anything from Sho Kosugi, and Van Damme's Bloodsport and Kickboxer (his other movies sucked the big one). It has great fighting scenes, decent yet predictable story, you like the characters, etc. etc. The sequels however were retarded, how an Olympian Tae Kwon Doe becomes involved in all these crazy adventures in 2,3, and 4 I don't know.

Director Robert Radler's film consists of a martial arts tournament, being held in Seoul, South Korea, between the American Karate team and the Koreans.The plot for Best of the Best consists of the assembly of the team, the selection of the fighters, their training by a dedicated coach (James Earl Jones), personal conflicts and triumphs, and the eventual showdown in Seoul with the Korean martial artists.Just one thing though It's not Karate they're training in; it's Tae Kwon Do, which is Korean! Much more, why would Korean fighters be training in an Okinawan art? What's going on here? (Tae Kwon Do is constantly referred to as Karate throughout Best of the Best and its sequels.)The best of these Korean Tae Kwon Do artists is Dae Han (Simon Rhee), a one-eyed Karate machine who accidentally killed the older brother of American martial artist Tommy Lee (Phillip Rhee) during a match, and he carries that guilt on his shoulders of having to watch his brother die. Coach Couzo (Jones), his assistant Don (Tom Everett), and their trainer (Sally Kirkland) have the duty of assembling Lee and four others to fight in Seoul Single-dad Alex Grady (Eric Roberts), Travis Brickley (Christopher Penn), Virgil Keller (John Dye), and Sonny Grasso (David Agresta). Their training regiment is long and difficult, with scenes inter-cut with that of the Korean fighters showing off their skills, jump-kicks and board breaks and all, leaving us wondering if our boys are really ready for Tae Kwon Do in its purest form.It should come as no surprise to drama hounds that they don't like each other and come from all walks of life. They have their personal squabbles too, like Alex's son is hurt in an accident and he himself struggles with an old sports injury, Travis's racist remarks only burden Tommy even further and alienate the men even more, and it's obvious that Couzo is hiding some skeletons in his closet as well. But once they learn to come together and act as a team, they'll manage all right (that's Best of the Best's message).Considering that Best of the Best has not gotten much attention, it is surprisingly well-made, well-written (with a story by Phillip Rhee himself and Paul Levine, who also worked on the script), and watchable. You do make a genuine connection with the characters (some are more developed than others), and you even feel for the Korean team at some points. The Koreans aren't some evil force out to conquer the world, but still aren't to be taken lightly because they're every bit as dedicated to winning as the Americans are. The script is uneven and the direction fades at different times, but these only seem to be minor obstructions from enjoying the picture.What it boils down to, ultimately, is a brutal full-contact tournament between the 10 members of both teams; the Koreans are fighting for national pride, while we're simply fighting for the right to be called the best of the best. We take a beating, all right, but there is something genuinely heartwarming about the ending, that will be left up to the viewer to see. What is most unexpected about this ending and events leading up to it, is that during an era rife with xenophobia and American jingoism, Radler's film sweeps all that stuff aside in favor of a somewhat balanced portrait of the other side.

Irony because he was the writer and the inspiration for the project. Irony because he was also the only real martial artist on the set -- and it showed. He was poetry in motion and the other players had to work to act like they knew what they were doing. Films either work or they don't. This one worked. The sequels, and there were many, did not.

But don't be fooled by his centered demeanor, Virgil does have a weakness. He finds nothing more persuasive than inner and outer labia.

After all, the Koreans practice for competition by trying to chop down trees with their hands.

The world's Tae Kwan Do championship is coming up and a team of 5 different Americans is chosen to face the reigning champions from South Korea. The Americans led by Coach Couzo (James Earl Jones) has to face themselves before facing their opponents, in more ways than one.We get your 80's character clich√© of The best fighter but with troubled past (Philip Ree), your guy who looks like a geek but could snap your neck in two (John Dye) your resident a-hole (Chris Penn), your supporter guy just to fill out the roster (David Argresta) and your leader who happens to be the star of the movie (Eric Roberts). We also got your female trainer who happens to care more about the fighters than their training (Sally Kirkland).Like I said, the on paper storyline development is phenomenal and James Earl Jones does a hell of a job in his role. Unfortunately other than Chris Penn, the rest of the cast leaves a lot to be desired. Sometimes Eric Roberts was a little too melodramatic in his role of Alex Grady and just looking at David Argresta in his role of Sonny made me laugh every time he appeared on screen.Now, as the movie progresses we learn that Tommy Lee (Philip Ree) happens to be pulling his punches because its discovered the leader of the Koreans Dae Han (Philip's real life brother Simon) had killed Tommy's brother years ago. Tommy doesn't want to hurt anyone but he's forced to literally knock out Virgil (Dye) to prove he can beat anyone. We also learn that Alex has a son who's injured in a car accident, and James Earl Jones comes off as a complete jerk to get Alex's mind off it. However in the end, James shows mercy and drives home the fact he is the best actor of the cast and his scenes later in the movie only prove it.Now for the plot holes....and there are a few. Apart from the shoddy acting, there's a scene where the 5 fighters are forced to run 20 laps around an outdoor track, which is 5 miles. We're supposed to believe Chris Penn....the fat guy from Reservoir Dogs and To Wong Foo....can run 5 miles without dropping dead? Also he supposedly does 165 sit-ups in a row, HA! Don't get me wrong, Chris Penn in his prime could play the antagonist as well as anyone but they really stretched the character's limits by having him cast. The next part is the bar fight where Team USA cleans house of the rednecks in the bar, how they didn't get arrested is what I'm trying to figure out.The ending is a little cheesy but it actually set up a we're all winners touching moment that even I thought was good. I won't give away too much but I'll get to the point and say the martial arts were good, James Earl Jones was good, the storyline itself was good, the ending was touching....but the acting was mostly ridiculous.My favorite highlight is actually something you'd miss it if you blinked. Wade (Sally) is getting Team USA to stretch and Travis (Penn) simply lays down, puts a towel over his eyes and goes to sleep while everyone else stretches and struggles.Overall its a very watchable movie with great fight scenes and Chris Penn and James Earl Jones delivering the goods.

I've seen (and will continue seeing) countless movies of all genres (I'm a fan of Woody Allen, Oliver Stone, William Freidkin, John Frankenheimer, Ridley Scott, Milcho Mancevski, John Woo...) and lately cannot even make myself finish watching over-budgeted, lame, boring, horribly scripted Hollywood crap targeted at people with an attention span of a chicken.Nevertheless, among the usually inartistic and less-intelligent categories such as martial arts or romantic comedies one can find a real gem. The cast is right on the spot; James Earl Jones, Sally Kirkland, Eric Robert and Chris Penn, even though not cr√®me-de-la-cr√®me actors, are well known and deserve credit for acting along major A-list actors during their careers (Eric Roberts was in the Dark Knight and pretty good to be honest). Now let's get to brass tacks a. it has a realistic, unburdened and clear plot; b. the 2 lead characters are well developed; c. the dialogue is superb, all characters seem human with fears, dreams and commitment we can relate to; d. the fights, even-though a bit unrealistic - the fighters seem intentionally slow at times waiting to receive the punches, are not over-choreographed, are entertaining and believable (injuries, tiredness, etc. are adequately expressed); e. typical American pump-up one-liners are kept at a minimum and only during the last showdown; f. the ending is truly fitting and unexpected. So, looking only for movies that have down to earth, realistic dialogue and believable development of events, irrespective of their weirdness, heroism or even everyday life simplicity, I truly recommend this one to all eclectic movie aficionados.Oh, the soundtrack is nice and pass on the sequels (they are not worth it).P.S. Please check also the romantic comedy Two Weeks Notice with Hugh Grant and Sandra Bullock for a surprising touch of great realism and dialogue.

The difference here is the excellence of the cast, which counts with legends such as James Earl Jones, Sally Kirkland and Louise Fletcher as bonuses, along with a, if not great, at least nice set of second team actors like Eric Roberts and the late Chris Penn. The tournament scenes are well-choreographed and filmed, without the fast pace modern films have and allows the audience a few cheers with the matches/battles. Another cool thing to see is the Korean training, compared to the couch potato Americans. It is hilarious to watch, also, the first time Sally Kirkland's character enters the training room.

There are five men in the national American karate team who have been picked to take on China in a tournament but the story really focuses on two of the team members which Tommy and Alex. Alex is a burned out fighter who makes a comeback and has dealt with tragedy in his past with the loss of his wife and trying to be a good single parent to his son Walter. Then we have Tommy who is battling his own demons with the thought of fighting the man who killed his own brother in a similar tournament many years back when Tommy was just a boy. This is where the plot unfolds and continues till they meet at the tournament. This movie always reminds me of Rocky but with Karate not Boxing because the film is watching them train and talking through there problems till they get into the ring. You may laugh at this but wait till the end of the film when Tommy comes face to face with his brother's killer Dai Hon and then we'll see who is brave enough to hold back the tears because I think it is some of the best B movie acting I have ever seen. Unfortunately this did no favours for the future of it's actors apart from Chris Penn maybe from Reservoir Dogs but the coach played by no other than James Earl Jones who makes his best performance in years that stands out in my mind.There are a lot of patriotic scenes that will roles back your eyes in emotion when the two countries come together at the end to unite even after all the bickering they endure to one another throughout the film.

This is much more than a film about a bunch of tough guys trying to kill each other.There is a much deeper meaning to this film.  It features characters from all walks of life.  The lower-middle class factory worker, a karate instructor, the egotistical cowboy, the Italian from the slums of Detroit, and the Buddhist in training all come together to work towards a common goal.  In only three months, these men must develop themselves as fighters and as teammates. They must overcome their differences if they want to succeed.The enemy in this film is the powerful Korean National Karate Team, a virtually invincible opponent.  The team from the states must overcome adversity that takes many different forms in this film.  Each fighter has an internal conflict that he must overcome.  The coaching staff even has its problems.James Earl Jones, Eric Roberts, and Sally Kirkland lead this great cast that turns in a tremendous performance.  Being a movie about its characters each actor had to really get into his or her role.

I mean are not they already the Best? Why do they have to show that they are the Best again?Anyway, this movie does one thing in that the movie does not really tell you who the Best are. (a sequel is in fact possible and I guess Phillip Rhee  should be thankful since his only acting, writing, or directing work in the past decade has been the Best of The Best franchise)Instead, this movie gets into the personal histories of really only 2 of the fighters. These fighters of course follow usual plot lines and eventually lead an under-maned and out-gunned team.The movie is definitely lacking in some respects. It does not deliver as a full fighting movie, nor is it believable as a pure drama type (root for the underdog movie).Basically, it jumps around and we only get bits and pieces of an interesting movie. (ie, it jumps from training to the bar to the coach to videos of the competition to history of the combatants to the kid to getting kicked off of the team to being back on the team, etc...). It seems that the makers wanted to put so much into the movie that they forgot that it needed to be a complete movie to begin with.Still I do like James Earl Jones, although some of his character's motivation (ie. the past teams) seems far fetched.Watched on video in 2001.

But what happens when a film forgets the 'montage' part and just gives us the training? That's what happens in Best of the Best, which barely leaves the film enough time to do the actual fighting at the end.The films opens with James Earl Jones of all people doing trials to cobble together a team of five Tae Kwon Do champs to go head to head with some Korean guys. He finally picks Eric Roberts (who has a 'five' year old son to look after), bumhole Chris Penn, Tommy (who has beef with the one eyed Korean champ), a Buddhist called Orville and an Italian-American guy who you know will be first up to have his arse kicked.After bonding with each other during a bar fight, our lads set off for some training under the watch of hard arse James Earl Jones, who shouts a lot at everyone. No one likes Chris Penn either, and to add to the drama Tommy's having flashbacks to his brother being killed and Eric's kid ends up in a coma! This lot need to neck some Beta Blockers and get to that tournament fast! Couch Earl Jones won't even let Eric have some emergency leave to go see his five year old teenage kid and therefore Eric quits the team and goes to see his son and no doubt buy more timotei for that hairdo of his, while Tommy quits as well. It's all drama, no kick boxing. C'mon! Get it together.Finally, and I mean with about ten minutes of the film to go, we finally get our kick boxing tournament. I'm all up for grown men round-housing each other in the face but this film is too well acted and too well made to be stupid enough for me to enjoy fully. Both Julia Roberts and Jones James Earl are fine actors, but couldn't they have taken a leaf out of a Gary Daniels or Godfrey Ho film and thrown in some side story involving drug runners or at least an exploding car or too? I paid thirty pence for all four of the Best of the Best films, so I can't complain much. I'm halfway through watching the second one and it's much better. "}{"Title":"Today, you have the chance to be the greatest martial artists in the world","Date":"16 May 2015","Score":"","Genre":"Action, Drama, Sport","Review":" I've started to write this review several times but aborted the attempts when I found myself unable to convey the quality of this movie. Mind you, I'm not necessarily talking about its theatrical value, but as its quality as a genuine martial arts movie, opposed to just an action movie with kicks. It's not the only film to attain this distinction, but the fact that it manages to do so on an adult level with a mixed cast of both acclaimed and (at the time) forthcoming stars qualifies it as the grown-up version of THE KARATE KID. If this means little or nothing to you, I advise you stop reading this review, but if you believe that the fighting arts can positively affect your life and that a good movie can be made of this concept, read on.The story A team of professional martial artists must master themselves under the tutelage of a tough coach (James Earl Jones) en-route to representing the United States in the national championships and an all-or-nothing battle against the formidable Korean national team.I won't deny that the movie strays into B-grade territory every now and again. Though the rest of its fights take place on the mat in a professional capacity, the film affords itself one bar brawl, similar to something you'd see in a Van Damme movie (albeit with six Jean-Claudes instead of one). The script seriously neglects at least one of the main supporting characters (David Sonny Agresta), and the inclusion of one main character (Sally Kirkland of Anna as James Earl Jones' co-trainer) is unnecessary. With that said, the movie features surprisingly strong acting for any kind of martial arts film. The cast list includes no less than three Oscar-nominees in pivotal roles (Jones, Sally Kirkland, and Eric Roberts), and while they're not giving the performances of a lifetime, they and the others are way beyond adequate. Jones' booming voice and Eric Roberts' emotional mini-speeches readily stand out as things that would have been difficult to pull off with a lesser cast and script and immediately set it apart from wannabe films that focused more on fighting.The fighting is worth more than half a glance, however. As the freshman outing of fight choreographer and quasi-villain Simon Rhee, the series of matches are a celebration of traditional tae kwon do, emphasizing realistic forms. The fighters are mostly real-life practitioners and collectively good, but I find myself appreciating the husky and uncharacteristically-cast Chris Penn almost more than the rest, as he goes to show that you do not have to be physically toned to excel at throwing kicks. There are a couple training scenes about, with the fights polarized to the first and fourth quarters of the film, and yet the martial arts are the subliminal driving point of the story. Each of the major characters has clasped onto a single aspect of them for Phillip Tommy Rhee, it's personal desire and sacrifice; for John Virgil Dye, it's the spiritual aspect; for Chris Travis Penn it's the building of confidence; and so on. Throughout the movie, the characters grasp additional aspects, therein becoming better people regardless of whether they win or lose their end matches. Some of the situations these concepts are demonstrated in can be hammy, but the emotional truth is untainted. The movie sets an upstanding example.Director Robert Radler would dedicate a good number of future martial arts flicks, but none with the emotional and dramatic worth of this, his magnum opus. I can honestly say that I can't think of a serious karate film buff who ought to be without this little gem - it's that good, even after two decades of future films to compare it to.

There's a reason why Best of the Best is not as well known as Bloodsport, The Karate Kid, and Rocky. The answer Best of the Best is an all-too cheesy copycat of of all three movies. Of course the movies have all drawn inspiration from one another, but Best of the Best is much inferior. But, having studied the martial arts and knowing different movies' intentions, I liked Best of the Best more than most people. Most people hated it, but not me! Mixed martial arts legend, Chuck Liddell called this his favourite fight movie growing up. It wasn't that good. Best of the Best is the prime example of a guilty pleasure. That's why I'm giving it 10/10.One thing I will give this movie credit for is it is about taekwondo. Most martial arts movies are either about karate or kung-fu, and lately, mixed martial arts. Many martial arts blend in well with each other, but I must give this credit where credit is due. It is about five taekwondo experts from all across America--Alex Grady, Tommy Lee, Travis Brickley, Virgil Keller, and Sonny Grasso (Roberts, Rhee, Penn, Dye, Agresta)-- who are chosen to compete against a team of unbeatable Koreans in a full contact fight. Each man must learn to work as a team and deal with their pushy coach (Jones) as well as their own personal demons. Sounds familiar? The main fighters it focuses on are Eric Roberts' and Phillip Rhee's characters, Alex Grady and Tommy Lee, whose subplots are actually pretty good. Grady is a widower who must provide for his young son, and Lee witnessed his soon-to-be opponent (played by Rhee's real life brother, Simon) murder his brother in competition and he swears revenge. Both subplots are good and provide the substance and seriousness that the movie needed. When Lee's subplot gets looked into more, it actually is heartrending and provides great sympathy for the characters. Best of the Best features training sequences, fights, and various situations that mirror the movies I mentioned earlier. Also, I mentioned that this was much cheesier. During the final fight scenes at the end, the Americans (good guys) are clad in black and the Koreans (bad guys) are clad in white. From a guy with fight knowledge, i can assure you that the fight sequences are very well done, but the fighters themselves are comical. Sonny Grasso is your stereotypical Italian, Virgil Keller is a hippy, Travis Brickley is a rude cowboy, and Alex Grady has beautiful hair. The Koreans don't have any distinctive features, but are still funny in how they try to look and act vicious. Tommy's opponent wears an eyepatch and looks like Snake Plisskin from Escape From New York and LA. Tommy is the only fully serious one. The fights are great and there's great emotion stirred up. It leads to a somewhat cheesy, but thoroughly wonderful ending.

The movie follows five best US contestants in full contact world karate/taekwondo championship against Korea. Trained by one of the best coaches in the US, the two leading characters are facing their own demons through training, now that was for the sense of drama&#x85; The film holds pretty interesting acting cast, starting with James Earl Jones, who plays coach Frank Couzo. Don't know how Jones ended up in martial arts film, but, I think he loved the character. Well, later he filmed another martial arts action film Excessive Force (1993), so he is fine by it, and he did his acting well as always. Now, we get to our two leading men&#x85; Eric Roberts, who plays a veteran fighter Alex Grady who returns after a long time absence, due to injury, to fight again on big competition. Roberts was solid in his performance, he always had that tough guy/martial arts image on his face, but he was funny on some occasions. Standing next to him as another leading man&#x85; Phillip Rhee who plays Tommy Lee, a real life martial artist and expert in Taekwondo and Hapkido. Tommy Lee participates in the tournament only because of revenge of his brother, who died by the hand of Dae Han, the leading captain of Korean taekwondo team. Rhee is not that quite good in acting, but I think he tried hard in some important scenes, but his martial arts scenes were great. Now, we get to our supporting cast&#x85; Chris Penn&#x85; well, Chris was a great actor, really intense in his performances, and I was pretty confused by his appearance here, because I saw him before in Reservoir Dogs and The Funeral. But, maybe he took the role because of his martial arts skills and&#x85; he was good as the tough, troublemaker, bully member of five best fighters. And than we have Sally Kirkland (wow, she was something back then), as a second trainer, that appears from nowhere to show a true spirit of Koreans and their taekwondo. And we also have such great actors as Louise Fletcher, a great actress&#x85; but her career was washed up, even back then and John P. Ryan as a manager of US team. Now, in the Korean fighting team we have two well-known fighters as Simon Rhee (brother of Phillip Rhee), who plays Dae Han, a very skilled Taekwondo master in real life, but not a great actor, and we have James Lew, who was known as a supporting opponent to many martial arts stars during 90s.OK, now&#x85; fighting scenes were good, the atmosphere during the fight was good, most of other things were solid&#x85; And, we have that usual effect of Korean team&#x85; they were presented as a real villains here. You know, because the US team is a leading team in the film&#x85; and of course, the Koreans look really evil here, they are really stone cold, crazy and scary, but that was to increase the drama&#x85; And we have that usual clich√© of fighters who are fighting with themselves before they enter the tournament, you know, the good old, you'll never win until you defeat your demons. Overall, it's a solid movie and I recommend it.

I mean it. It was not released legally here so we had to watch this and many other martial arts movies illegal on a VHS tape with a terrible video quality and many times dubbed in six or seven languages. It was pretty terrible but we saw many movies that way.But I did not see this movie on a VHS tape. I saw it on the TV about ten years ago. It was really terribly dubbed but I thought it was great. The fights were very good and the story was good enough to make an 11 years old boy happy.I saw it again a few weeks ago. I really enjoyed it but this time I didn't think it was that great. The fights were really good but the story was not that good. The acting was not good. Some people here say that it was good to hire actors instead of martial artists to play the roles but they are pretty wrong. Eric Roberts is an actor. But he has black belt in karate and that is why they hired him. Chris Penn had a black belt too. Not to mention Philip Rhee. But the characters were one-dimensional and not as developed as they had to be. The only really good actor here was James Earl Jones but his character was wrong somehow. I mean wrong. He was the trainer of the US karate team but he was FAT and completely out of shape. And he was not a martial artist. How could he train martial arts masters? He didn't show any martial arts experience or knowledge in the entire movie. Also the movie didn't need the character of Sally Kirkland. Really. May be she was supposed to represent the spirit of the martial arts or something like that but I think they put her in the movie just because there has to be a female character. But the big problem of the movie was... I don't know. I will call it americanism. It is obvious that the movie was made to make the Americans feel they are the greatest nation of the world. When you see a Korean guy yelling USA! USA! you will get what I mean. We could even see the Americans in the bar watching a martial arts tournament. That is not normal and you know it. They watch football or basketball or even boxing. But not karate. And what we saw was not a world karate championship.

The Best of The Best deserves more than 3 sequels, Phillip Rhee should have kept this masterpiece going instead of ending it because now we see less of him and we know phillip adores his fans, I wish he would do something that could make him get more involved with his fans so that they can see him more often, I'm sure he doesn't want to be forgotten about by them, I'm sure they won't but who would want to risk it? anyway, the movie is great and so are the actors and the sequels, love it, wish I could see more of rhee than what I'm seeing right now, which is nothing, I give this a 10 out of 10 stars because it deserves that and much much more.

I remember this film having great fight scenes and a compelling, better than average story and solid acting. The passage of time has conspired to prove me wrong.Best of the Best is not a bad movie by any means, just not as good as I remember it to be. Phillip Rhee is the only actor on the American team who can fight without the benefit of editing and stunt doubles. The rest of the cast just throw some sloppy looking basic punches and kicks, when combined with quick cuts and sound effects, gives the appearance of them actually fighting. I'm growing tired of other user comments disparaging Hong Kong martial arts films. The best action scenes in the best HK films make the fighters in this movie (with the exception of Rhee and the Korean fighters) look like geriatrics fighting underwater.This movie's plot device of competitors dying in a Tae Kwon Do match is also ludicrous. In international competition, TKD fighters wear heavy chest padding as well as headgear. They have about as much chance of dying as getting hit by lightning during the match. I could see the possibility of someone dying from a professional boxing match (which has happened hundreds of times, unfortunately) or an MMA (mixed martial arts) event, but not a TKD tournament.Basically, this movie seems to have been conceived as a love letter from Phillip Rhee to Tae Kwon Do out of a sense of ethnic pride in which he trumps up the effectiveness of TKD. Ask any serious MMA fighter, and you'll learn the TKD is of dubious value in a real fight.

(spoilers)","Date":"26 September 2004","Score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Drama, Sport","Review":"  'The Best of the Best,' though an American martial arts production, is just as corny (minus some decent fighting sequences especially in the finale) as the Asian productions (and there are plenty to choose from). This movie combines the drama and martial arts genres to develop a product chock full of conventions and clich√©. The basic story is that of the newly formed U.S. Martial Arts team, which is preparing to compete against the highly disciplined (could you imagine doing this for your whole life?) Korean team. James Earl Jones, whose character doesn't seem quite developed, plays the coach of the team, Coach Cuzo, a guy who often wants his fighters to excels, but sometimes enjoys a bit of innocent rule breaking. Eric Roberts is Alex Grady, the oldest fighter on the team, who joins the team to I suppose prove something to his young son, Walter. Not much is stated about his intentions to join the team in regards to the relationship with his son (unlike other films, there is a close father and son bond), but he does claim that the opportunity is the only thing he's got. Walter embodies your dramatic elements and devices in the movie and does so to such a degree that Eric Roberts comes off as a rather pathetic fellow. Joyous and proud, I suppose were the intentions, but really, it's hard to take him seriously towards the end. They just packed the dialogue with too much moralistic gushiness and inspirational blah...blah. Your martial genre is symbolized by one of the team's best fighters, Tommy Lee (Phillip Rhee), who is paired against Korea's best fighter that Tommy knows all too well, because like all martial arts movies, Dae Han (played by Simon Rhee, Phillip Rhee's real-life brother) had killed Tommy's brother in a fight when Tommy was much younger. Tommy is both scared that Dae Han, an extremely powerful fighter, would kill him in a match, but also that Tommy's emotions might get out of hand and that he could kill Dae Han in a fight. This martial arts genre clich√©, develops half-way through the movie, when the Korean team is finally introduced. Prior to that, we just see juxtasposing scenes of the Americans and Koreans training in their own way. It's hard to believe that the Americans were able to muster any strength against the Koreans, given their training discipline versus the slacker Americans. But then again, this movie, included with the genre, also manifests that American pride and goal-setting structure so common to movies like these. So, even if it is corny and predictable, we still anticipate it.Despite these genre conventions however, and the flaws therein, the movie does offer up a significant amount of fast-action fighting sequences, both in and out of the contest. To watch Chris Penn, who plays the arrogant cowboy type (from Miami of all places), swing kick a cigarette out of guys mouth is pretty cool in the scenes just before the bar brawl. And the final competition between Dae Han and Tommy Lee are guaranteed for a little jaw dropping awe. I suppose, if you're going to watch a martial arts movie, the fight sequences should dominate more than anything else, even stupid stories. I mean, hell, if the stories were what mattered, half of the martial arts movies out there (especially from the 70s) wouldn't be around because they are all based on one repeated story to avenge the death of a master/father/brother/uncle, etc.  "},{"Title":"Makes Rocky 4 look like a cheese and wine party","Date":"9 September 2001","Score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Drama, Sport","Review":"  This film had everything tears, violence and drama.

That is, it attempts to be a feel-good, character-based movie about endurance, loyalty and patriotism, wrapping it up into a crowd-pleasing package with some great tournament battles along the way.It doesn't work.I found myself bored by this uninvolving film, one that's dated in the worst way of the '80s. The fashions are ludicrous, the hairstyles ridiculous, the characters overblown and boorish. Take, for instance, Eric Roberts's supposed hero, a vain, posturing and mulleted muscleman who looks like an extra from MASTERS OF THE UNIVERSE. His appearance alone encapsulates everything that's wrong with this movie.Other characters fare no better. Phillip Rhee is underused and his character only springs to life during an unexpectedly poignant twist at the climax. James Earl Jones gets a few good speeches, but that's it. Chris Penn plays a loudmouthed jerk, and the others are bland and interchangeable.The film meanders through one clich√© to the next, with family drama interspersed with some rather dull bar-room brawls and the like. The tournament at the end strives for grandeur and excitement, but instead I was itching for it to be over so I could go to bed. ROCKY this ain't.

Alex jumps at the chance to try out for the team & is one of the five lucky ones who are picked to represent the US along with Tommy Lee (co-writer & co-producer Phillip Rhee), Travis Brickly (Christopher Penn), Virgil Keller (John Dye) & Sonny Grasso (David Agresta). Under a tough training regime run by Coach Frank Couzo (James Earl Jones) & guidance from sports psychologist Catherine Wade (Sally Kirkland) the five martial artist's home their bodies & minds to become the best of the best but will even that be good enough since team Korea are considered near unbeatable...Directed by Robert Radler this rather tame martial arts film seems to have developed a bit of a cult following over the years & has spawned no less than three sequels (although in name only to be fair), personally I didn't think that much of it & a half decent cast is wasted on broad sentiment, questionable metaphors & bad dialogue. The basic concept of Best of the Best is the same as Rocky really, the underdog in the fighting arena (be it boxing or martial arts) comes through in the end despite personal issues & fearsome, seemingly unbeatable opponents. Also, much like Rocky it has to be said, Best of the Best features several musical training montages that are horribly dated thanks to the lame 'Best of the Best' theme tune & the training methods. The character's are stock clich√©s, the fighter who wants a second chance to prove himself, the big fat strong one with a bad attitude & one who is scared to fight as his brother was killed in the arena ten years ago & thus seeks redemption & a chance to overcome & control his fear. Of course no martial arts film would be complete without a tough, but likable & fair coach & Best of the Best is no different, did you really think it would be? The film also tries to have a stab at a few moral messages like team spirit, if you try your best you will always be a winner & the pinnacle of Best of the Best's deep meaningful plot is a scene in which two young brothers are at a petrol station & the younger one drops his ice cream onto the ground & starts crying so his bigger brother lets him have his ice cream, with depth & meaning like that why was Best of the Best never nominated for best picture at the Oscar's?At over an hour & a half Best of the Best is kind of boring, it's well over an hour before team US even get to Korea & apart from a bar fight all the combat takes place during the last twenty minutes in very controlled tame bouts. I mean it's even rated PG so don't expect any gruelling fight scenes, a few kicks & punches & that's it & no-one dies either. In fact best of the Best features one of the slushiest endings I have ever seen in a martial arts film where the object of the character's is to beat the living hell out of one another, at the end of Best of the Best both the US & Korean teams hug & make-up & become friends. What? We don't want hugging & friendship we want to see people's teeth knocked out & bones broken.There's a few surprising names in the cast not least James Earl Jones who probably just needed the money & wanted a free holiday to South Korea. John P. Ryan has nothing more than a cameo & his character is totally forgotten by the end as are the themes of corporate sponsorship that his character raises while Oscar winning actress Louise Flethcher has a small role too. Eric Roberts has a very bad late 80's mullet hair do while Christopher Penn is as thin as I can ever remember seeing him in this. Phillip Rhee & his opponent Dae Han Park played by Simon Rhee are in fact brother's in real life.Best of the Best is a musical montage fans dream, there's about six of the things but everyone else is going to be disappointed. There's far too much pointless training filler & the broad morals raised are paper thin, a good cast wasted really. Followed by Best of the Best 2 (1993), Best of the Best 3 No Turning Back (1995) & Best of the Best Without Warning (1998).
