[{"Title":"Oscar Worthy Performance by Michael Keaton","Date":"14 December 2001","Score":"29 out of 29 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama","Review":"  	One of the toughest things about drug and alcohol addiction is owning up to the fact of that addiction; being able to say, `I'm an addict.'  Because until that happens, the addiction will continue and the prospect of getting any help will lessen with each passing day.  And the important thing is getting that help before it's too late, regardless of how it comes about.  It's being able to recognize the opportunity and having the gumption to take advantage of it, which is what happens to a young man on the brink of disaster in `Clean and Sober,' directed by Glenn Gordon Caron.  Michael Keaton stars as Daryl Poynter, a high power real estate broker with a couple of problems  He's appropriated some $90,000 from an escrow account to play the stock market (which quickly took a nose-dive on him, leaving him about $52,000 short), but that's not even his biggest problem; his biggest problem is that he's a cocaine addict, as well as an alcoholic-- and he doesn't even know it.  All he knows is that his life is in turmoil and he can't fathom why.  And when a girl picks up at a mall ODs in his bed one morning, his life really begins to fall apart.  He needs some time to sort things out and he needs to get away-- to hide for awhile-- and he comes up with a brilliant idea; he'll hide out in a rehab center where they guarantee anonymity and confidentiality.	He checks in, and it works.  Nobody knows where he is, and the rules of the house prevent him from having any contact with the outside world.  But Daryl-- a born hustler-- has hustled himself into a corner this time.  Because he can't stay in if he doesn't play the game, which precipitates taking a long, hard look at himself.  So for the first time in his life he gets caught up in his own scam; and it just may be his salvation.  But before he can come back, he's going to have to hit rock bottom first, which he does-- in a pivotal scene involving a phone call to his mother.  And it's only when he's faced with total collapse that he finally begins to look inward, and to take stock of how he measures up against the others he meets at the facility; when he starts to realize that he's not the only person on the planet.	Working from a tightly written screenplay by Tod Carroll, director Caron delivers a hard-hitting film that takes an uncompromising look at the effects of addiction, without relying or dwelling upon the physical aspects of the problem to illustrate the depths of despair to which it can lead.  To be sure, Daryl looks strung out; but that aside, the story relentlessly chronicles how swiftly drugs and alcohol can wreck a life in all regards.  It's a powerful statement, unflinchingly delivered in a concise and straightforward manner.  Caron approaches the subject head-on, avoiding any melodramatics while keeping it grounded in reality, which enhances the impact of the drama as it plays out.  And it clearly demonstrates how far-reaching the problem is, in that it touches so many others-- friends and family-- any and all who come into contact with Daryl.  It gives a personal perspective on the issue that is even more pronounced, in fact, than that of Sandra Bullock's `28 Days' or the more recent `Blow,' and is more emotionally involving as well, on the level of Steven Soderbergh's affecting drama, `Traffic.'  This is an Oscar-worthy film on any number of levels, but 1988 was the year of `Rain Man,' and the Academy was clearly looking in another direction, leaving this film without even a nomination.  And it's a shame.	As Daryl, Michael Keaton gives a performance that had Oscar written all over it; that he failed to receive even a nomination for his work here is a travesty, as this is without question the best he's ever done and on a par with any of the best of that year, including Hoffman's Oscar-winner.  Whenever an actor can disappear within a character so completely-- as Keaton does here-- it speaks volumes about the performance and the believability of that character; and there's no sign of Keaton when Daryl is on screen.  Keaton has a very definitive persona, but as you watch Daryl, there's not so much as a fleeting glimpse of Billy Blaze in `Night Shift,' Carter Hayes in `Pacific Heights,' Jack in `Mr. Mom,' or even `Beetlejuice' or `Batman.'  With Daryl, Keaton has created a unique character, so real and presented with such intensity, that even a passing thought that this is an actor playing a role is impossible.  And that's a performance that deserves much more than a passing nod of acknowledgement.	Also turning in an extremely affecting performance is Kathy Baker, as Charlie Standers, a fellow addict Daryl meets in rehab.  Baker has an alluring quality that works perfectly for the blue-collar character of Charlie, whose vulnerability quickly gains the sympathy of the audience and helps to draw you into the story emotionally.  There's an obvious softness beneath Charlie's rough-hewn exterior that is becoming, a down-to-earth aspect of the character that Baker conveys quite nicely.  This is a very real person she puts up on the screen, and it's easy to believe that she operates a crane in a steel mill, because there's nothing in the way Charlie is presented that is false or pretentious.  It's a solid performance, and one of the strengths of the film.	The supporting cast includes Morgan Freeman, who gives an understated, impressive performance as Craig, Daryl's counselor; Claudia Christian (Iris); M. Emmet Walsh (Richard), Tate Donovan (Donald), Brian Benben (Martin) and Henry Judd Baker (Xavier).  A realistic examination of a problem that affects virtually everyone either directly or indirectly, `Clean and Sober' is a sobering film that, while at times is emotionally draining, is nevertheless a worthwhile and entirely satisfying experience.  10/10.

This stands as his best dramatic performance ever, in a career filled with many fine dramatic and comedic roles.  As Darryl Poynter, Keaton shows us a character that starts out as a total heel and a user, but is slowly transformed by his stay in a drug and alcohol rehab center (and his interactions with others there)into someone who genuinely begins to see the errors of his life and makes a concerted effort to change.A fine ensemble cast adds to the drama, including Morgan Freeman, M. Emmet Walsh, Kathy Baker and Tate Donovan.  The script by former National Lampoon writer Tod Carroll is filled with memorable characters and realistic situations and is further enhanced by the solid no-nonsense direction by Glen Gordon Caron.An excellent and WAY under-appreciated movie that was thrown away by Warner Bros., Clean And Sober is a riveting drama of rehabilitation and redemption that will stick with you long after you see it.

He play a slick addict that is only looking to hide from life's problems at a drug rehab clinic run by the ever wise, and tough-minded Freeman. Even if there are minor flaws in the film, they don't matter. There are moments of truth and clarity that are rarely seen in a movie now days. There is a scene when Keaton's sponsor, played extremely well by Walsh, tells Keaton's character, that he cannot be responsible for someone else's addiction. He asks him, could anyone have made you stop? It so silly, but no matter what, we as human beings continually look to take responsibility for others, when we can barely control ourselves!  The supporting cast is terrific. Morgan Freeman as the clinic's counselor is just perfect. Kathy Baker is also memorable as a person who is lacking self esteem and cannot see the forest for the trees. A recovering addict herself, Keaton attempts to help her, while he is also romantically interested in her. Definitely a four star movie. I have watched this over and over & never tire of the performances.

A serious night of partying goes deadly wrong for Daryl and he finds himself a fugitive from the law and decides to hide out at a drug and alcohol rehabilitation center, aware of their rules regarding confidentiality. Daryl resists the program initially, still in denial, but eventually comes to realize that he is really an alcoholic and a drug addict and that he must deal with this realization if he ever wants to look at himself in the mirror again. This movie is gritty and uncompromising in its realistic depiction of drug and alcohol addiction and where the addiction can take you. Daryl is depicted breaking into his office looking for money as well as calling his parents asking them them to apply for a second mortgage on their house so that they can lend him the money. These scenes are frighteningly realistic for those who have dealt with addiction or have a loved one caught in the grips of addiction. Michael Keaton delivers a powerhouse performance, the best of his career, as Daryl, the big shot who sees his world crumbling around him and continues to deny what the root of the problem really is. Morgan Freeman gives his usual solid performance as the head counselor at the rehab center. Kathy Baker, Tate Donavan, and Claudia Christian also offer solid support as fellow rehab clients and M. Emmett Walsh plays Daryl's sponsor, a relationship Daryl accidentally stumbles into. If you have ever had a problem with drugs or alcohol or care about someone who does, CLEAN AND SOBER is an important film to see and ponder. The film doesn't answer all the questions that may come to mind about the disease of addiction, but it clearly shows where denial can take someone suffering from the disease A riveting and powerful film that should not be missed.

(minor spoilers)","Date":"19 May 2004","Score":"13 out of 14 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama","Review":" Clean and Sober is a sobering drama about the tragedies of addiction. Michael Keaton is Daryl Poynter, a fast-talking washed up real estate who finds an acquaintance in his bed, dead from a cocaine overdose, and himself facing real criminal sanctions after money goes missing. As a drug and alcohol addict, though refusing to admit it, he checks himself into a rehab clinic only to avoid his employers who are looking for the missing money and cops who want to interrogate him about the dead girl. For Daryl, rehab is only a safehouse, not a reality. He doesn't face the fact that he has real problems and needs real help to get back on his feet. Things are whirling too quickly out of control for him to keep up on the outside and his experiences in the clinic are his own, sobering experience.The clinic is overseen by a former addict, Craig (Morgan Freeman), who is Daryl's counselor who can only help Daryl when Daryl helps himself. Craig tires playing games with Daryl, who has no interest in cleaning up, but only hiding out, and even faces getting kicked out. Daryl finally wakes up largely due to interactions with fellow residents in the clinic, each having their own horror story about how their addictions tore apart their lives in one way or another, putting them in debt, neglecting their families, neglecting their health and so forth. Daryl slowly starts to witness the reality and stops considering everything to be a big joke. These are real people with real problems, and he's one of them. He even goes so far to try to help someone else recover from the pitfalls of their addictions, befriending Charlie Standers (Kathy Baker), who still lives with an abusive, junkie boyfriend. Unfortunately, for her, she is beyond saving, and her helplessness leads to her own destruction.After watching Clean and Sober, you can see similarities between the stories as well as the characters among this film, the Sandra Bullock comedy, 28 Days, and the Angelina Jolie drama, Girl Interrupted. It is a powerful, though sad, drama and one well performed by all involved. And, it is, as a previous viewer wrote, an honest look at real people.

I have always admired Michael Keaton's work. He is one of those actors who can do both comedy and drama and do it very well. 1988 was an incredible year for Keaton, he was even featured on the cover of Newsweek. He was in two films that year where he played parts that were as different from each other as night and day and he was awesome in both. In Beetlejuice he played a comedy part. He was hilarious as a lecherous scuzzball from hell. He was just too funny to be scary. That was as original a comedy as you would ever see and it was due largely to Keaton's wonderful performance. In Clean And Sober he plays a dramatic role just as awesomely. This film is dark and gritty and at times depressing. You feel drawn into the darkened world of drug addiction where there is no hope and no light at the end of the tunnel. Watching Darryl Pointer's tortured life reminded me of a poem I heard that went    Now hollow fires burn out to black and the lights are dimming low    Square your shoulders lift your pack leave your friends and go    Fear not my friends, naughts to dread look not left or right    In all the endless hell you walk there is nothing but the night Darryl is a real anti-hero in so many ways. He is self centered, very abrasive and he just checks himself into the rehab center to get the heat off himself because after a night of boozing and coking there is a dead girl in his bed. At first glance, Darryl is a real sob (even Keaton said that he was at first tempted to turn this role down because this guy is such a pig). BUT, but you still care about this guy because Michael Keaton's amazing acting makes Darryl seem so real to you. You say to yourself God help him, let him see the light before its too late. Morgan Freeman was relatively unknown at the time, but he carries the load as Darryl's almost saintly counselor. There is one scene that takes place when they are both at a urinal (how touching!) where he tells Keaton to take it one step and one second at a time. SPOILER ALERT!SPOILER ALERT! Kathy Baker gives a fine performance as well as another addict that Darryl ends up really connecting to. You feel so sorry for this woman and sense the pain that she has inside as well. I think her biggest problem was just plain self hatred. How can other people love you if you don't love yourself? The most painful lesson that Darryl learns is that you can't control other people's lives and change their destinies. It's wonderful when you see this man who was so self centered start caring about other people and realize the truth about his own addictions. Critics raved about Keaton's performance one said Give Michael Keaton the Oscar for Clean and Sober Maybe its because this film was so dark and gritty and almost film noir like that it wasn't given the credit that it so justly deserves.

I didn't know until now, but the fact that he didn't even get a best actor nomination is a travesty. He did, however, win a Film Critic Award for best actor. The year this movie came out must have been a year of great movies, either that, or the Academy sucks. The part near the beginning of the movie where he is at his friends house, and his friend is going to play tennis, and Michael Keaton says, do you mind getting me another one of those beers? was exceptional, and then you knew this was going to be a great movie. Morgan Freeman does an exceptional job as the drug counselor (but then I expect nothing but great performances by this man). And the casting was also exceptional.The only problems with this movie I felt were that overall it seemed like a very low budget movie, and Kathy Baker was a drag on the overall message.

It is amazing that he was not given anything close to an Oscar nomination for his role. He definitely deserved more recognition than he got. Nonetheless, he proves here he can do a serious role quite well.Keaton is Daryl Poynter, a yuppie real estate broker who is oblivious to his alcohol and cocaine addiction. He has embezzled $92,000 from the company escrow account and invested it in the stock market. But he lost this gamble, and now must quickly recover the money or face serious embezzlement charges and termination. As if that's not enough, he wakes up one morning to find a dead girl in his bed from an overdose (someone he partied with the night before). The police are on his case about the dead girl, the girl's father has posted fliers around the neighborhood branding Daryl a murderer, and his employers are about to discover his embezzlement. Daryl is in a bind, and needs to hide out for a while to straighten things out. He tries to leave town, but his credit cards are maxed out. He is turned away from staying at a friend's house, so he gets his own idea a drug rehabilitation clinic promising discretion and confidentiality. Thus, he takes advantage of it.The catch is that Daryl does not think he has a problem, and only wants to hide out in the clinic rather than face the music. His saving grace may be counselor and former addict Craig, played by Morgan Freeman. Craig is a no-nonsense, tell-it-like-it-is type of person, and has seen and heard all of Daryl's lies and tricks. Daryl must play by the rules and face his addiction, or get expelled from the facility. He begins his slow transformation when he meets Charlie Standers, played by Kathy Baker, in rehab. Charlie operates a steel mill crane, and lives with an abusive addict boyfriend named Lenny. When Daryl gets to know her better, he offers her a way out of her situation. He also comes to like her, although she does not feel the same way about him right away. But controlling someone else's problems and destinies is next to impossible (even a bit conceited), as Daryl finds out the hard way and through his AA sponsor Richard, played by M. Emmet Walsh. Will he see the light and admit to his problems before it's too late? Can Charlie find the courage to leave Lenny, or is she headed toward destruction?I highly recommend Clean and Sober for anyone who has ever had a substance abuse problem, knows someone who has, or is a family member or friend of an addict. No matter the circumstances, this film is truly a wonderful depiction of the consequences involved with addictions of any kind. The good news is that if one is willing to admit to their problems and get help, with consistent effort there is light at the end of the tunnel. A terrific film with realistic people and challenges!

But if you really stay tuned and pay attention, it is an inspiring story of redemption of a human being that has reached rock bottom, but along the way finds himself and his soul. In this film, Michael Keaton gives the best performance of the year, 1988. It still ticks me off to this day that he wasn't even nominated for Best Actor at the Academy Awards. But the National Society of Film Critics did recognize him as Best Actor that year for this film and BEETLEJUICE, so that is something.Keaton plays Darryl Poynter, a middle class (back when there was one to speak of) business executive who is deep into alcohol and drugs. One morning, he finds the girl that he hooked up with has overdosed and calls the cops. He is informed to stick around town until the matter is resolved. He has also embezzled money from his company for a business scheme and rather than face what he has done, he checks himself into a rehab clinic (he heard about it over the radio). The clinic would completely 'hide' him and keep his confidence. No one would know he was there or how to find him.Darryl's initial intro to the clinic is rocky to say the least. He immediately antagonizes the clinic's counselor Craig (played by the great Morgan Freeman). Craig knows that Darryl is a con artist and is just using the clinic as a shield. Darryl also has a few shaky run-ins with fellow addict Charlie (played by Kathy Baker in another Oscar-worthy performance in this film). During his time at the clinic, Darryl gets to meet with a sponsor Richard (played by the great character actor M. Emmett Walsh). Slowly but surely Richard helps Darryl to see that he is indeed an addict and needs help, and the main source of help needs to come from within himself.I recall seeing this film when it first came to video and then cable back in the late 80s and I must have watched it repeatedly at least a dozen or so times around then and have had the privilege of seeing it a few times since. It is surprisingly watchable and not as downbeat as it appears. It is realistic without being sentimental, sappy, or overly emotional. Every moment is believable and every character is authentic, even the most minute ones. And Keaton is just plain remarkable. I can't wait to see it again. This is easily the performance that Michael Keaton should always be remembered for and associated with.And it is a film that anyone who has ever felt like their life was in turmoil and there was no hope should watch and learn from. With a great lead performance, strong supporting ones, a solid script, and a finely tuned story, CLEAN AND SOBER may be the best film ever about such a sad, important subject.

I think it's a great film. Each time I see it I like it even more. But, at the same time, each time I get let-down by the ending. It's so lame and contrived when Kathy Baker is driving and then a car crashes into her car and then she's dead and poof, Michael Keaton is talking to his sponsor crying and the next scene he gives a speech about how much he went through, thus mentioning a funeral - and then the movie ends. Kathy's character only dies for to aid the main character's plight, i.e. to give him closure, and I hate when this kind of thing happens, when a character has to die to help a more important character progress. But no matter, this is a great film for one hour and forty minutes. You'll really feel as if you're anticipating Keaton's every move. His acting is awesome. And it's great to see Morgan Freeman. This is before he got the fame he deserved. One great scene is when Keaton is in rehab and about to move on to the next step, going from his detox pajamas to regular clothes, and he walks out of the television room with the news on and as he does an airplane on the screen that had been taken over by hijackers the day before suddenly explodes. The hijacker story on the TV began when Keaton was first admitted into the hospital and then ended in tragedy after Keaton is done detoxing, and it's symbolic of how, when getting sober, nothing else really matters... the world could be ending on the outside but you're still just trying to get to the next step. It also showed the selfishness of his character, not caring about anything or anyone but himself. Keaton keeps his character as a selfish jerk, even when he gets nice and cleans up, and that's realistic and quite refreshing because sobriety doesn't dissolve the selfish personality traits that led to the addiction in the first place. I recommend 'Clean and Sober' (or as we used to call it 'Scene and Clover') highly except for the ending. But you know that already having read this review.

With a sponsor who is exactly what he needed - a bastard with a heart - he gains insight into his own life and finds his direction.What I enjoyed was that the movie did not pound a point into us. As if we could not get the concept. It let us gather in what was told and watch what happened. We see some in sight into the mind of the addict, without it being a person we really could care less about. Some how we feel for him and want him to find a good path.My friend told me that the scenes in rehab were authentic, complete with the sex that takes place. 13th stepping as they call it.Keaton plays the role so well you can forget who he is and take in the character.If you know someone who is working a recovery, you might enjoy watching this with them, not only for what they can tell you, but for what you might learn about them.

"},{"Title":"well-made drug rehab drama","Date":"11 November 2010","Score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama","Review":" This sort of topical cautionary fable usually plays better as a television movie-of-the-week, but here the Big Message is downplayed in favor of a frequently engrossing drama, presenting erstwhile funnyman Michael Keaton with a meaty character to cut his dramatic teeth on. Keaton plays a young high financier and substance abuser hiding from the authorities in a drug rehab center. The role allows him the opportunity for some colorful temper tantrums and histrionic withdrawal anxieties, and he responds with a high-strung performance anchored by an excellent cast of veteran co-stars. Half way into the film the screenplay meanders into an uncertain (if thankfully unsentimental) love story, but just before it can end happily ever after a surprise plot twist brings reality back with a jolt, leading to a bittersweet conclusion almost spoiled by an annoying, self-congratulatory epilogue. It may not win any battles in the war against drugs, but the film is a cut above the usual big screen temperance lesson.

I've loved him ever since I saw 'Batman', as a kid, I imagined being him while playing to be the dark knight. As I grew up, the late 1990's, Keaton was not being seen much in movies. But as a fan, I continued watching his movies. Be it his hits or flops, I followed the characters he portrayed.'Clean And Sober' is a film that makes me proud to be a Michael Keaton Fan. He delivers like never before. He plays his careers most important, message-oriented, complicated role in 'Clean And Sober'. He plays a hot-shot real estate dude, who's a drug-phony and has a lot to do with a recent death. Keaton gives this dark and selfish character so much of depth, that he over-takes the entire film. He is the life of the show.As a film 'Clean And Sober' caters to a niche audience. It's a mature film, that you begin to understand slowly. But it has terrific moments, superb dialogue, and as mentioned from the very start, Michael Keaton At His Very Best! Reccmended to all Keaton buffs out there, this is a performance that we can cherish about for a really long time.

There's no doubt that he gets most of the screen time, and his character of Darryl Poynter is the one around whose experiences the movie revolves. Darryl is a hot shot commercial real estate salesman with a couple of problems first, he's embezzled $90,000 and is on the verge of getting caught, and second, he's an alcoholic and drug addict who hasn't admitted that fact to himself, and who discovers (at the same time he realizes that his embezzlement has been found out) that a girl he picked up at a mall the night before has died of an overdose in his bed. With everything closing in on him, Darryl needs a place to escape to so that he can figure his next move out, and he decides to check himself into an addiction counselling centre to take advantage of its confidentiality. He has to lie his way through while there, to convince his counsellor (played by Morgan Freeman) that (1) he accepts that he's an addict, and (2) that he's serious about recovery so he can stay. At the centre, he meets Charley (Kathy Baker), who's dealing with her own addictions and her relationship with her husband, who is both an addict and abusive (certainly verbally; possibly physically.)While Keaton was the star, I was actually far more taken with Baker's performance and her character of Charley. She did a great job portraying this character who was struggling to overcome her drug and alcohol addiction, but who continually allowed herself to be manipulated by both Lenny (the husband) and Darryl, who develops a real obsession with her (to the point at which he seemed more like a stalker than anything else.) I thought Charley's story was more interesting and far more sad, while Darryl was most interesting when he was dealing with Charley. In the end, a tragedy involving Charley (which somewhat mirrors the tragedy the movie opened with) is what jars Darryl into finally admitting to his addictions.This isn't the most powerful movie dealing with the issues of addiction and alcoholism I've ever seen (I'd probably give that nod to 1962's Days Of Wine And Roses with Jack Lemmon) but it's an interesting, if somewhat melancholy, movie. 7/10 "},{"Title":"Different kind of drug film.","Date":"18 August 2008","Score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama","Review":" Clean and Sober is quit different from most movies I have seen dealing with drugs (as a main theme). Most of the film takes place during and after rehab, which is somewhat unusual (but not bad in any way). Michel Keaton is really good as a drug addict. The role is different, but shows his more serious and adult side. This being said, the movie, unlike most drug movies, isn't really powerful or extremely dramatic. In fact, its rather dry in that area, but is still good (and even somewhat better than a lot of drug films) because its very realistic and believable. It also goes in depth with the characters personal lives outside of drugs, rather than focus on their actual drug addiction. Its a good movie overall, definitely recommended to any fan of Michael Keaton or anyone who likes well made but realistic drama's. I rate it 8/10.

His portrayal of an addict struggling to regain control of his life laces his usual comic prowess with just enough depth and insight; it must have taken remarkable technique and control to bring us from revulsion to sympathy without ever spilling into pathos. Take him away and the movie is a well crafted and earnest 12-step promo. It's nice that they steer away from Hollywood happy-ending crap, but what they offer in its place seems like simply a different kind of cliché the 80s version of the 'serious' movie. Morgan Freeman manages to avoid the burden of being inspirational, but the same cannot be said of M. Emmett Walsh, who of course deserves better. Still, I did watch it beginning to end when I had other things to do. Thanks Michael Keaton.

Although the movie doesn't go full-throttle to depict the real hell some addicts go through, the movie still has several uncomfortable (as they should be) scenes that give us some idea of the life of an addict. I also appreciated that the movie ends with not everything rosy in the main character's life, that there is still a lot of work for him to go through. Keaton gives a real solid performance - I didn't think of his comic roles in other movies while watching this movie. Though Morgan Freeman and M. Emmett Walsh also deserve kudos for their supporting roles. My only real objection is that the subplot about the woman who died in Keaton's character's home at the beginning of the movie is dropped around the midway point and never brought up again. From what I saw, the cops and the father of the woman should have still been searching for Keaton. Otherwise, this is a real good movie, well worth your time.

Based on most responses, it's probably one of the more realistic and better-executed drug and alcohol addiction movies. That's only if you can stand to watch it.I have very limited experience with drug and alcohol addiction and was unable to relate to any of the characters. I also couldn't muster up much sympathy or empathy for them either. I do love romance, but here I just wanted Keaton to get clean and sober and to not get involved with the women. With my lack of interest in the characters and their situations, this film offered me very little, and I found it boring and slow-moving.The film also doesn't seem to stand up to the test of time. Very dark lighting that made it look like a bad 70s cop show. But then again with its dark content, that might be on purpose.My personal recommendation is to not watch Clean and Sober but if you are looking for a drug and alcohol addiction film, or are taking a class on Michael Keaton roles, then this is certainly worth a look.

This very serious drama is a real change of pace for him but that doesn't mean that it was a good move. Keaton is actually at his worst portraying a drug addict who serves time at a drug rehabilitation center and gradually undergoes treatment in an effort to help him get over his addictions and dependancies on narcotics. Keaton just doesn't cut it in the role of a junkie. Ignore this one and see his other 1988 film vehicle, Beetlejuice which is far better.  "}]
