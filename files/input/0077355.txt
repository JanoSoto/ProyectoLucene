The concept was novel, and surreal. Dr. Susan Wheeler, (Genevieve Bujold) is a successful, beautiful, and intelligent woman, at Boston Memorial Hospital. She has a love/hate relationship with fellow doctor Mark Bellows (Michael Douglas). She has no reason to suspect any sort of foul play at work, until she looses her best friend to an accident during surgery. A deep investigation leads on to the awful truth, that her friends death was no accident, and other deaths weren't either. Much more suspense and intrigue await at the Jefferson Institute, were the shocking truth is revealed. Michael Crichton is just as good a director as he is a writer. The two leads play great off each other, and Jerry Goldsmiths score will send eerie vibes through you goosebumped skin! The first, and best medical thriller, COMA has everything a proper, intellectual movie needs. Terrific introductions, affective development, twisted characters, and mystery for the bold, and brave. A classic to be known, and enjoyed over and over again.

Dr. Susan Wheeler (Genevieve Bujold) wants to know why much to the disappointment of her doctor boyfriend (Michael Douglas). When she tries to find answers, she finds herself marked for death.Michael Crichton directed from Robin Cook's great novel. There are huge gaps in logic, but the film is so exciting and entertaining those can be forgiven. It's fairly well-directed and well-done overall. There are many great sequences--Bujold being stalked by a killer in the hospital late at night; a visit to the creepy Jefferson Institute; some lovely views of Cape Cod MA; Bujold, and then Douglas, tracking a suspicious oxygen line and the accidental death of a janitor. Also there's Jerry Goldsmith's loud, pounding score moving the picture along and, best of all, this was shot on location in Boston.The acting is so-so. Douglas and Bujold are OK as the leads. Richard Widmark is having the time of his life playing a hospital administrator. Rip Torn and Elizabeth Ashley also turn in good performances. Also look for Tom Selleck, Ed Harris (with hair!) and Joanna Kerns in bit parts.A very good movie. However you do have to deal with some very dated dialogue of Bujold trying to make it in a man's world. Also be aware that this is pretty extreme for a PG rated movie--there are fairly clear shots of Bujold's body during a shower scene and plenty of nude, dead bodies in a freezer sequence and some really gruesome scenes throughout the hospital.This film has disappeared for some reason. It caused a lot of excitement around here when it was filmed in 1977 and was a big hit in 1978. Then it just disappeared. That's surprising considering how the careers of Cook, Crichton and Douglas have taken off. It deserves rediscovery.

It creates a mood and builds suspense to an almost unbearable degree. Elfin Bujold (sporting a truly unappealing hairstyle) is Dr. Susan Wheeler, a principled, dedicated intern at a major hospital. She begins to notice a disturbing trend...that folks with purportedly minor surgeries are not coming out of their operations conscious. From this point on, it is virtually Bujold against the world as a gallery of sexist, condescending doctors (including her own lover Douglas) tries to poo-poo her findings or encourage her to lay off. Naturally, she can't leave well enough alone and is soon up to her ears in intrigue and violence. The film has a blatantly frank point of view. People eat sandwiches while they are examining cadavers. Brains are sliced like deli meat. It's all very clinical and unsettling to non-medical viewers. There are several highly-charged moments including a duct hole exploration and a chase through a seemingly abandoned hospital. Jerry Goldsmith's clanking score doesn't take center stage until late in the film, but is wonderfully nerve-wracking when it needs to be. Bujold and the Chief of Staff Widmark make wonderful counterparts as they come from different generations and different eras of medicine. Best of all is the brief, but unforgettable, appearance of Ashley as the world's most intimidating nurse. In her opening scene she blinks exactly once! Her voice is a monotone terror and her stare is up there with Medusa's. The section that contains her is surreal, but arresting and very campy! Adding to the fun is a series of small appearances by people like Torn, Chiles, Selleck and Harris. This is a frightening film with some memorable imagery and a startling amount of skin for a PG film.

Set against a hospital backdrop ranking in verisimilitude with that of THE HOSPITAL (the only other accurate medical drama of the 1970's), this is a gripping thriller even on repeat viewing over twenty years later. Bujold's acting has been mentioned by other reviewers, but I would award special accolades to Richard Widmark, whose character's unctuous avuncularity is executed with superb subtlety. Plus, he even comports himself just like a real physician of seniority.I do have a few complaints, not least of which is the gratuitous and grossly inaccurate portrayal of clinical lab personnel and the laboratory environment. Shame on Crichton, who must have missed out on visiting the lab through his entire tenure as a medical student. The laserdisc transfer is technically one of the worst I have in my collection. The monaural soundtrack is overdriven and distorted; the colors are washed out; and careless unmasking of the print (COMA is not letterboxed) results in visible boom mikes in several shots.Still, this is a classic film, and anyone who wants to get up to speed on medical movies wouldn't want to exclude COMA.

She tries to tell her boyfriend fellow physician Michael Douglas about what's happening, but he's not buying it.

In her performance Bujold manages to hit the notes of idealism, vulnerability, and toughness at the same time, not easy to do. Bujold for instance, scared as she is, proves quite the match for Lance LeGault who's trying to kill her.Some others in the cast are Richard Widmark, head of the hospital medical staff where she works in Boston, Rip Torn the very well connected head of anesthesiology which seems to be where the problem lies and Lois Chiles whose case sparks Bujold's interest.Making early film bit appearances are Ed Harris and Tom Selleck. But the performance that will totally creep you out is Elizabeth Ashley, head of the institute where all the coma patients are warehoused. She makes Nurse Ratched from One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest like Mary Poppins.Coma is a fine thriller of a film and those last few minutes with Bujold quite vulnerable will have you on the edge of your seat.

In terms of the suspence, tension and general spookiness of such a normal and everyday subject as hospitals, doctors, etc., was very influential in how I perceived the things around me.  The great thing about the film, and the book - of course, was that we put our trust in people like doctors, policemen, goverment officials, and the like - and most of the time that trust is blind faith.  Dr. Cook and DR. Crichton are masters at this genre - Making the incredible credible.  Even though this film is a bit dated, It is almost becoming a reality.  In China, prisoners are harvested for their organs so others can benefit. Technology, like in the film, can now sustain life for as long as the machine(s) and/or computers can function.  It was Sci-Fi in 1978 - now an all-to-real reality.  Back to the film itself, I thought Dr. Crichton did a wonderful job on the directing and the screenplay.  The material he had from Dr. Cook was first-rate.  The cinematography, done by A.S.C. President Victor J. Kemper was outstanding.  The technique of keeping the images at the hospital as cold, sterile and clinical as possible was brilliant.  Mr. Hirschfield's Jefferson Institute sequences were also fantastic.  Dr. Crichton's editing pace was also a stroke of genius.  All editing was done with straight cuts.  No zooms and very few dolly /pan shots.  This was keep with the theme that YOU, THE VIEWER, are in the hospital and the cuts are as impersonal and precise as the doctor's scalpel.  The cast was also well thought out.  Ms. Bujold, even though she speaks with a thick French-Canadian accent, was the perfect protagonist.  You do not have to be an Amazon Woman to be strong and independent.  Mr. Douglas was a bit sleepy in his role, he just needed more to do.  Mr. Widmark was perfect as the Chief, as was Mrs. Ashley as the Institute's head matron.  Look for Tom Selleck and Ed Harris in their first movie roles.  Also, in the Jefferson Institute sequence, you will see a young Christopher Reeve as a hapless victem of the movie's plot.  All in all, Coma is one of those films that, even though had moderate success at the box office, is really a forgotten gem in the MGM vaults.  It proves that you do not need blood guts, or special effects to make a great movie.  Gee, kind of like Mr. Hitchcock.

The hero is a heroine, a doctor at a major Boston hospital. The actress is French Canadian Genevieve Bujold, a slight but strong character, one of the first of the admirable women leads in movies in the New Hollywood and feminist aftermath (thankfully). In truth, she is admirable if sometimes stubbornly solitary in her pursuit of the evil she has uncovered at work.And that evil is a series of unexpected comas in young patients, including her best friend (who has gone in for an abortion in this Roe v. Wade era, under the guise of a less politically loaded procedure). This leads to more sensational aspects that I leave to you to uncover.By her side, either for her or against her (you can't tell after awhile) are two huge Hollywood names, an aging Richard Widmark as the head of the hospital and a young Michael Douglas as another up and coming surgeon (and Bujold's lover). The politics as well as the medical ethics get increasingly mixed up in sensational trashy novel style, which is exactly what this kind of movie needs. It's fun, quasi-realistic, interestingly speculative, and overall well made.Yes, well made and well directed. Crichton pulls of his second full Hollywood production off with conviction. It feels like a routine, well made, Hollywood movie from 1978--it would have been terrific at a good drive-in, and it's great at home, too. Just to be sure, the movies at the time that were more inventive and impressive included Deer Hunter and Midnight Express to name just two. And in its own way this tries to touch on an explosive idea at the time (beyond the casual abortion aspect), which is the dignity of life and the black market in body organs.

Another of those movies is the weird early science fiction movie by George Lucas of which the title escapes me right now.In Coma, it was in particular the image of the Jefferson Institute building that recalled an evening somewhere in the late '70s. There's probably no movie featuring a more effective and suggestive modern-style horror house. For me, the Jefferson Institute complex perfectly impersonates and clenches the feeling that this intelligent thriller is trying to get accross. By its architecture and desertedness, it suggests sterility, impersonality, loneliness and the feeling of an industrial complex. The sterility of a medical system that does well in the technical aspect, but features a growing impersonality that makes it miss its primary goal to make people feel good. The loneliness of Bujold, who is rather assumed by everyone to be paranoid than to be believed, even by her boyfriend. And the industrial feeling of a healthcare system that doesn't exist to cure people, but to keep itself alive as an industry (=profitable).With the arrival of sophisticated genetic techniques, the medical horror genre is bound to return soon to the big screen.

I think that is some of the reason for the low ratings. The other is the basic rule of conspiracies, the one that wrecked Capricorn One The more people know about the conspiracy the less likely it is. Here we have an entire organ stealing operation with a storage center for those deliberately put into comas where they keep them until they get buyers for their organs. The amount of people, at the hospital and at the storage building render its believability quite low. Yet, it is relentlessly suspenseful and scary. There are lots of stalking of Bujuold, and chases in the dark across the grounds and in the buildings. She hides on the campus of the medical school while this creepy guy shadows her. You will never forget the scene where she pushes all the plastic bagged cadavers on top of him in the morgue. The movie was well written in the amount of scares of the pop out variety and chasing with stalking. It is not for the kids. The medical methodology for putting people into comas seemed well done to me but I am not a doctor.Widmark has a very tiny role here, he does it well but if you sneezed you would miss him. The acting has some shaky sections; Douglas is just starting out here. It is one of his first movies after being on TV's The Streets Of San Francisco do not expect the skilled actor of the 90s you will be disappointed.

Many of these have been detailed by my fellow imdb reviewers and I could throw a few more logs on the fire myself, but the Hollywoodization doesn't spoil the sinister edge to the film.                 Bujold is surprisingly good in the lead role, carrying virtually the entire movie scene-for-scene, and Michael Douglas is pleasant as Bujold's accommodating boyfriend.  But the best performances are Richard Widmark as a somewhat sympathetic head of surgery, and Liz Ashley, terrific as the administrator of the dreaded Jefferson Institute conducting weekly guided tours and giving a chilling dialogue on the future of health care.   Crichton's direction isn't overly inspired, but I loved the broad shot of the cold sterile Institute and Bujold and Ashley's tense first meeting and the sight of the comatose bodies suspended at varying heights is so stunning that, once seen, is never to be forgotten.  3 1/2 *** out of 4       "},{"Title":"Edge-of-seat thriller","Date":"20 May 2001","Score":"2 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama, Horror, Mystery","Review":"  I like the fact that this is a rare story where a woman is dependent upon her own wits to get out of a life-threatening situation instead of being doubtful when the man is trying to get out of the same.

Based on the bestseller by Robin Cook, and brought to the screen by Michael Crichton ( the man behind 'Westworld' and 'Jurassic Park' ), it is a terrifying exercise in Hitchcockian suspense. 'Dr.Susan Wheeler' ( Genevieve Bujold ) notices that a number of healthy people have been lapsing into comas during routine operations. All have happened in the same operating theatre. The comatose patients are then shipped off to the mysterious Jefferson Institute. When Susan's best friend Nancy ( Lois Chiles, later to appear in 'Moonraker' ) also lapses into a vegetative state, Sue investigates, uncovering a conspiracy led by Dr.Harris ( Richard Widmark ). The Jefferson Institute is illegally using the bodies for medical experiments. Attempting to expose the scheme, Susan is herself then drugged and sent off for an operation. It is down to her boyfriend, fellow doctor 'Dr.Mark Ryland' ( a young Michael Douglas ) to try and save the day...French actress Bujold showed tremendous promise in 'Anne Of The Thousand Days' ( 1968 ) but sadly never lived up to it. Not her fault. The scripts she was offered were mostly poor, such as the execrable 'Swashbuckler' ( 1976 ). 'Coma', though, is an exception. Anyone who thinks movies in which women are the main characters are a relatively new invention should be made to watch it. Douglas' character, by comparison, is a supporting one.'Coma', even when viewed thirty-three years later, is strong stuff. Scenes such as Susan being shown round the Jefferson Institute and encountering dozens of bodies suspended in mid-air are horrifying to this day. When an assassin follows her into a room full of vertically-stored corpses, she pushes them and they topple on top of him like falling dominoes. The suspense is highlighted by a typically brilliant Jerry Goldsmith score.Things To Look Out For - one of the doomed patients is a young Tom Selleck ( future 'Magnum P.I.' ).Film versions of books are often inferior, but 'Coma' does not dumb down the story. If anything, it is better. Cook's novel was badly let down by a weak ending. The film's climax, however, is right on the money.

Of course, one can never follow a novel completely since what can be conveyed to the minutest detail in a 600 page novel definitely cannot be packed in a two hour movie. But still, when you do not miss out the essential aspects of the movie, only then can you satisfy those who have read the novel. Coma is one of the fine examples of how a movie can be made out of a good novel.Coma is based on the novel of the same name by Robin Cook. Robin Cook, being a man of medicine himself is able to present to us with great amount of realism as to how the profession of medicine can be used for commercial selfish gains. Most of his novels are set in a premise where the men of medicine are misusing their powers in order to gain wealth. The story of Coma is about a hospital where something suspicious is going on, as discovered by our lead character &#x96; Dr. Susan Wheeler.The movie then shows how her suspicions prove to be right but she gradually discovers the complexity of the plot and is then faced with a dilemma as to who can be trusted and who cannot be trusted. The best part of the movie, as is the best part of the novel is that it works in a smooth flow and makes us believe that what is being depicted is a surreal possibility and who knows &#x96; somewhere in world, it just might be the truth.For a movie that is made in 1976, the direction, screening and scripting is simply beautiful. It keeps us on the edge of our seats and gives our gray cells plenty of exercise as they try and anticipate as to what is going to happen next. The whole cast does a wonderful job in creating a movie that will for me remain one of the most defining movies in the genre best described as medical thrillers'.

This movie is definitely in my list of favourite movies of all time, as it has all the necessary elements that make a movie great.First of all the directing by Michael Crichton is excellent. Almost every camera shot has a meaning to it. The best scenes, however, are all the chase scenes. Every one of them captures you complete attention, notably the Jefferson Institute sequence. The general feel set throughout the movie by the directing is similar to Roman Polanski's 'Frantic', where you can feel the tight edge to the film without the help of acting or music.Secondly, the script, also by Michael Crichton, is superb. There isn't a single piece of unnecessary dialogue throughout the whole movie. The deception over who is the real Dr. George is very well written. Also, the descriptions of surgical procedures in the movie are very clear to understand.Thridly, the cast is great. Genevieve Bujold is perfect as Dr. Susan Wheeler, the doctor who is tormented by the fact that something is amiss at the hospital, but no-one believes it is true. You can really feel the character's shock, grief, horror, torment, terror etc. because of the great acting by Bujold. Michael Douglas is also brilliant as Dr. mark Bellows, Susan's boyfriend who never completely believes her story until the end.Finally, without the score by Jerry Goldsmith the movie wouldn't be nearly as suspenseful as it is. The music during the Jefferson Institute chase is very suspenseful.Overall, a must see movie for fans of a solid thriller. However, if you're looking for action and special-effects-to-the-max, this probably isn't the movie for you.

After Susan's best friend ends up in a mysterious and unexplained coma, Susan uncovers a conspiracy at the hospital which involves putting random patients into comas to use them for organ harvesting. Unfortunately the hospital staff are killing anyone who tries to help her find information, and she's their next victim. What's shocking in this film isn't so much the hired assassin or the comas, it's the fact that a hospital, which is there to help everybody who is sick, has so much disregard for human life that they'll kill people and sell their organs for money without thinking of the families and friends of the victims. In reality there is a big debate over whether or not organ harvesting is ethical and moral. Organ donation occurs every day, but there is consent from the donor. In this movie there isn't. However, there are several stories about human vivisection and taking organs from living people in third-world countries, which is really very disturbing. And although my country has free health care most countries do not, you must have medical insurance to receive care. It is true, hospitals care more about money than life these days. The acting of all characters was exceptional, and the ending was very suspenseful, when Wheeler herself was to become the next victim of the coma plot. The background music was pretty eerie. The movie itself was based on a novel written by the king of medical thrillers, Robin Cook. Decades later Coma was adapted into a TV miniseries. A similar movie was filmed in 2008 that shares elements of Coma, the horror film Autopsy. It's really worth watching, especially if you're a fan of horror that points out real-life issues.

Unlike those rousing crowd-pleasing adventure yarns, COMA is a film which works on subtlety, building up a level of quiet suspense unseen in all but 5% of such would-be films. Yes, this is great stuff, with tons of atmosphere and suspense, great acting from the entire cast and a large, complicated (yet easy to follow) plot with far-reaching implications. There are so many great scenes in COMA that it's hard to keep track of them. There's a wonderful stalking sequence in which Bujold finds herself being chased by a murderous mystery man, which makes the best use of a hospital I've yet to see in a movie - forget the gory, boring HALLOWEEN 2, this is the real stuff and with not a drop of blood to be seen. There's also a really nail-biting climax which had me on the edge of my seat - something which only a small handful of films are capable of doing.Following in the footsteps of other '70s conspiracy films like THE CONVERSATION, COMA lets the plot unfold at a slow pace, building up pieces of a jigsaw until it all falls into place with a horrific clarity. Genevieve Bujold is excellent as the smart and sexy young doctor who acts as the eyes and ears of the audience, as we follow her journey and never get ahead of her in her investigation. The camera-work and music is also great, with fine locations (the Jefferson building couldn't look more sinister) and some excellent visuals, like the famous shot of the comatose bodies suspended from wires in a warehouse. The action set-pieces are well handled and stick in the mind (like the murder of the janitor, for instance, which has the best on screen death by electrocution I've seen).Bujold is supported by a familiar cast of old and new faces, all of whom put in fine turns. Michael Douglas is the misunderstood boyfriend who helps Bujold in her research, while Richard Widmark has the fun role of the evil mastermind (don't worry, it doesn't take much to work that out) behind the illegal organ donation scheme. The rest of the cast includes Tom Selleck as a victim, Rip Torn as a doctor and a chilling turn from the guy playing the hired killer; it's a shame I don't know the actor as I'd keep an eye out for him.

Moreover, I'm seriously relieved that neither myself nor any of my closest relatives is due to check into the hospital for any type of 'routine procedure' any time soon, as one single viewing of this film is enough to make you paranoid and suspicious about everything that might be going on there. Susan Wheeler is a young and promising resident surgeon at the acclaimed Boston Memorial Hospital who, following her own friend's simple abortion gone wrong, begins to investigate the unusually large number of spontaneous comatose cases. Apparently, and during the past year alone already, more than ten totally healthy and young patients fell into a coma after seemingly routine surgical procedures. Dr. Wheeler suspects a conspiracy, especially when it turns out all patients were treated in the same OR and transported to the mysterious Jefferson Institute afterwards, but the entire medical staff &#x96; including her ambitious fellow surgeon and lover Mark Bellows &#x96; revokes her attempts to prove it. I was seriously surprised to eventually find out how rudimentary the denouement of Coma in fact is. The mysterious occurrences and Dr. Wheeler's private investigation lead towards a fairly logical and even somewhat predictable conclusion, but still it I must admit it left me disturbed and speechless. This is entirely Michael Crichton's earning, as the screenplay is very careful and thrifty with the revelation of elementary story elements and twists. Coma basically could have been a rather short and straightforward thriller, but Crichton expands it into a compelling and sometimes even somewhat overlong mystery thriller. I've read in the trivia section of this website that both the author of the original novel, Robin Cook, and writer/director Michael Crichton hold a doctor's degree. This is clearly noticeable in the dialogs and automatically turns Coma into a far more plausible and respectable medical thriller. Believe you me, I've seen numerous hospital slashers of which the dialogs didn't contain any medical terminology at all and that is quite pathetic to observe. Coma works terrifically as a tense and nail-biting thriller, but admittedly it isn't the most exciting movie ever made. The development of Dr. Wheeler's research keeps you on the edge of the seat, but the actual action and suspense sequences are tedious and overdone. The assassination of maintenance witnesses, for example, is completely gratuitous and even Susan's hysterical escape from the Jefferson institute feels dragged in just to appeal to fans of the more exploitative 70's thrillers.

Investigating the case, she discovers both an unusually high instance of coma amongst otherwise healthy patients, and extreme resistance to her actions from senior colleagues. Is she clutching at straws, or is there a deadly conspiracy at work ?Robin Cook's bestselling novel Coma is the classic organ-harvesting cabal thriller, a staple of tabloid headlines ever since, but there's only one movie which deals with the subject, and the reason is because it's a near-perfect thriller that couldn't be bettered. It does what so few thrillers do; it gets the balance of characterisation and authenticity and action and suspense exactly right. The first half is an immersive, completely believable depiction of hospital life (Crichton was a medical student at Harvard) - the cast seem more like medics than actors - whilst the second is a delirious, nerve-wracking fantasy of assassins, murderous chases, futuristic cryogenics and political coverups, and the shift from one to the other is seamless. Bujold is convincingly out of her depth but determined to uncover the truth, and Douglas is the ultimate don't-rock-the-boat corporate climber, forced to make fundamental decisions about who to believe. Both are excellent, with strong support by Widmark, Ashley and Torn as the heavies, and nice bits by Chiles, Selleck, Doyle and a young Harris.

I find it disappointing that Crichton hasn't made more films, because although he's a great writer it's his directorial style that really scores - his grasp of visual grammar, suspense and eye for spaces in the frame. Most movies made by writers-turned-directors (e.g. Sleepless In Seattle) show little visual flair, whereas by contrast Crichton's movies are full of imaginative effects (see Westworld and Runaway particularly). Coma has a big set-piece chase sequence through the deserted hospital which is spectacularly creepy and unsettling, and the Jefferson Institute scenes are just breathtaking. With the possible exception of the work of David Cronenberg, this movie taps into everything that has ever unnerved you about doctors and hospitals, and is one of the finest conspiracy thrillers of the seventies.

Although, when Dr. Susan Wheeler's friend happens to be one of those casualties, she takes it upon herself to dig in deep, about this strange occurrence, as the frequency and cloud covering it seems to be way too fishy. Soon, she finds herself in one big conspiracy that just doesn't want to be found out with plenty of obstacles blocking her path and no one believing her.No wonder why hospitals can give you the wet-willies! Director / screenplay writer, Michael Crichton's Coma is a glum medical thriller with a very scary idea and builds suspense and intrigue up like Hitchcock flick. The secret web of crafty turns and unpredictable patterns, works extremely well with its cleverly planned out and thorough script, which takes its time in setting up the mystery and paranoia edge. It's truly effective in that department, but I did find to be overdrawn and finish with a too soft of an ending. The compatible looking production gives the film a little more credit and a certain slickness to its B-material. Yeah, it's b-stuff, but the key is, it's done very well with it opting for a more serious outlook despite the silly nature of it all when you look deeper into it. In patches it does get quite nagging and I found it hard to actually connect with the bitter heroine in this piece. The story doesn't particularly flesh out these characters, but really, they are secondary to the morbid actions occurring. Genevieve Bujold gives in a true performance as the headstrong Susan Wheeler, who puts her nose where she's not supposed to, but I found the character very unlikeable and frustrating. Michael Douglas who shares the screen, basically isn't given too much to do, but he's fine in the co-role as Wheeler's sceptical boyfriend / fellow doctor Mark Bellows. Richard Widmark gives a tip-top performance, Rip Torn is fair and so is Elizabeth Ashley. In bit parts, are Tom Selleck and a creepy looking Ed Harris. Chiming in is Jerry Goldsmith's kinetic score that's truly on the alienating side and crisp photography gives the film a real nice shine when capturing the cold and sterile setting. Novelist / director, Crichton, does a efficient job in the director's chair and he frames some well-executed, blood curdling and nail biting scenarios.The thriller Coma, provides a good dosage of ghoulish entertainment.

His loss to the world of medicine, though, has been cinema's gain, as admirers of The Andromeda Strain as well as this film can testify. Like the English director Bryan Forbes, Crighton has always seemed able to produce thoughtful and original work which touches on the boundaries of normal experience, and this is no exception. Crighton gets good performances from the whole cast, with Genevieve Bujold, in particular, reminding us of what a fine actress she can be. As a doctor suspicious of certain goings-on in her hospital but disbelieved by everyone around her, including her on-screen lover Michael Douglas, she shows courage and determination (without ever losing her femininity) which is welcome in a female lead.

Susan investigates the circumstances surrounding her friends coma & discovers a high rate of young, healthy patients who mysterious come out of routine surgery in a coma. Susan's investigations take her to the Jefferson institute where the coma patients are taken & where she finds out the horrible truth...Written & directed by Michael Crichton this is a pretty decent thriller. The script is slow going at times which is a shame because it can become a bit tedious in places, it sets the basic situation up of people mysteriously ending up in coma's but then doesn't do anything with it for ages as we see Susan search for the truth. This is OK & it provides a taught enough thriller but I just wish it was a little bit more eventful & not quite as long. The basic story is interesting, it's as much a psychological horror as thriller as it plays on our fears about Hospitals. Places where we go to be healed & cured, the notion & idea that these sacred places could be used for evil gets to you on a basic level & in that respect the story is effective. Unfortunately the film is rather ponderous & takes absolutely ages to do anything with the idea & even then I felt the eventual end was a bit of an anti-climax. This is a good solid thriller for sure but I wouldn't call it a classic by any stretch of the imagination. The character's are good, the dialogue is OK & the story is interesting but I just couldn't help but feel a little bored while watching it.Director Crichton is usually better known for his big budget screenplays like Jurassic Park (1993) but he turns in a relatively tight & taught thriller even if it's a little slow going at times. There's a nice atmosphere to it & the seeing the comatose patients in the Jefferson institute hanging by wires is sort of creepy but there isn't many out & out scares, it's a film which constantly tries to build the tension until a big climax which as I said I don't think was as good as it could have been.Technically the film is very good, it has that Hollywood polish about it. Actually shot on location in Boston in Massachusetts. The cast do a good job & the acting is fine, this was an early role for Michael Douglas & as such isn't the star while Tom Selleck has a small role & loses his kidneys.Coma is a decent thriller that entertains to an extent, there are some interesting ideas & notions but it's all just a little bit too slow going & unspectacular for my liking.

The film draws on the fears of people doing terrible things in secret and also the idea of what goes on while you're under the anaesthetic while having an operation. The film's plot follows the mysterious goings on at a hospital after several patients slip into comas. Of course, comas are a normal occurrence at hospitals; but it's happening far too often for Dr Susan Wheeler's liking, and so she sets off to find out the truth behind what's happening. But sometimes, the truth is too difficult to take. Because of the way that the film draws it's plot, the overall atmosphere is one of paranoia; and the movie taps into this with the viewers in order to make itself interesting. Throughout the film, the audience is never really certain what's happening and the way that the film holds certain cards towards it's chest until they have to be played gives full credit to the assured plotting.The film is typical of the seventies because of it's bulky plotting and the way that the action is forced onto the viewer. The seventies was a definite golden age for cinema, and although this isn't one of the golden films of that era; it shows that it was the golden age because even the lesser seventies films did what they set out to do, which is something that cant be said for this day and age. The acting in the movie is largely good, especially when you consider that this movie is closer to the 'b' side of cinema than it is to the 'a' side. The acting in 'b' movies often leaves a lot to desire, but I'm happy to say that isn't the case here. Geneviève Bujold, despite having roles in a few notable releases (such as De Palma's Obsession and Cronenberg's Dead Ringers) never really got noticed enough to be a star, but still does well here. Her opposite number is Michael Douglas, which despite only being a co-star really, still manages to do well with his role. On the whole, I don't recommend having high hopes for this one...but it is worth watching.

It still makes the hairs on my neck stand up, one of Crichton's scariest films.The movie takes place at Boston General hospital. The two main characters, Michael Douglas(Dr. Mark Bellows) and Genevieve Bujold( Dr. Susan Wheeler). The two doctor's have a rocky relationship. They love each other, but they can get on each others nerves. Dr. Wheeler is a doctor who is smart and doesn't get the respect from some of her colleagues , because she's female.One day her best friend, Nancy Greenly goes in for a simple procedure, but does not wake up. She is in a Coma, on life support. When Wheeler finds out she is devastated, she wonders what went wrong? She is so upset she tells Mark, he explains to her that something must of happened with the anesthesia. At first you don't know if Bellows is on her side or not, because he doesn't seem that concerned. Then when another patient comes in for knee surgery, Sean Murphy(Tom Selleck) the same thing happens to him. Wheeler does some investigating, and finds out the two surgeries were done in OR 8. It gets around to Dr. Harris( Richard Windmark) about her snooping and she needs to drop it. In order to keep her position at the hospital she must also see a hospital psychiatrist. She is also warned by Bellows and this starts to put a strain on him , and his promotion. Bellow explains that these are powerful people, especially Dr. George(Rip Torn); the head of anesthesiology.She ignores the advice and finds out these coma patients are taken to The Jefferson Institute. A center for long-term coma care, among other things.One day Mark and Susan go away for the weekend, upon returning they pass The Jefferson Institute. Once there Wheeler is already suspicious. There she meets the nurse( Elizabeth Ashley). Susan believe she is getting closer to the truth and the answer lies her at the institute. She also thinks Mark is involved which really drives her into more hysteria. She learns that people are deliberately being put into comas. The next day one of the custodians approaches her, and tells her how they do it. When she goes back to the hospital to find out the mystery, she realizes she is being followed. The fixer( Lance Legault) chases her though out the hospital. She discovers the custodian has been killed, and how they are putting people in coma's. she is getting closer to the truth because of the looks she gets in the doctor' lounge especially by Dr. George. He dislikes her because she independent and nosy. She doesn't know who to trust, that day she arrives at the institute for the tour. Once there she finds out everything, the Jefferson Institute is a front. They are really harvesting and selling human organs to the highest bidder all over the world. Wheeler's next step is to find out who is behind it. Once back at the hospital She and Dr. Harris have a discussion about it. He is the the one who is behind it; and wheeler doesn't realize this until he tries to kill her. He schedules an unnecessary surgery, telling the other staff it's her appendix. He will try to kill her while making it look like an anesthesia reaction. When Mark arrives he doesn't think anything of it until Dr. Harris demands OR 8. It will be up to Mark to try and save her before it's to late.Coma is a classic suspenseful medical thriller. When I had my first surgery in 1998, all I could think of was this movie. We all think doctor's would do their best, when our lives are in their hands. COMA shows the dark side of the medical profession, that we hope never will happen. A great film I would recommend to anyone, a true classic.THX, Kris L.

Her boyfriend and fellow doctor is not convinced that anything out of the ordinary is going on, but Dr. Wheeler is suspicious.  She begins asking questions and looking at hospital records.  This is not taken well by the head of the anesthesia department (Rip Torn) and even less well by the head surgeon at the hospital (Richard Widmark).  She does some investigative work of her own and makes a morbid discovery at 'the Jefferson Institute'.  It becomes obvious that Dr. Wheeler is being watched and that her own life is in danger before this film reaches its nervewracking conclusion.Directed by Michal Crichton, Coma is put together well with many nice touches and good performances from the actors.  The suspense builds as the story progresses and unfolds intelligently.  Genevieve Bujold is especially believable in her lead role as Dr. Susan Wheeler and Richard Widmark is very effective also.  There are some parts of the film that I consider graphic gratuitous medical scenes, such as the removed brain of Dr. Wheeler's friend (Lois Chiles) being sliced up for an autopsy and the internal organs being held by a medical person as he is cutting them open with a pair of scissors.  The scenes may be realistic, but they aren't for the squeamish.  All in all, Coma is a glossy movie which moves along at a brisk pace and which has all of the fine attention to detail and suspense that many of Alfred Hitchcock's films have.

Susan Wheeler, a young doctor at the hospital was a close friend of Nancy, and when she starts looking into her friend's death she finds a disturbing pattern. Over the last few years the same thing has happened to numerous young, relatively healthy patients during routine operations. The numbers are far higher than would be statistically expected, but when Susan tries to voice her concerns she is met first with complacency, then with obstruction, and finally with threats that her career will be at risk if she persists in investigating this matter. Even her boyfriend and fellow-doctor, Mark Bellows, refuses to believe that anything sinister is going on. Undeterred, Susan continues to investigate, only to find that she has stumbled upon a horrifying conspiracy and that her own life is in danger.Today, a plot like this would seem quite commonplace; the Hugh Grant vehicle Extreme Measures from the mid-nineties is so similar to Coma that it virtually qualifies as an unacknowledged remake. In the seventies, however, such a plot probably seemed much more original. Although there were exceptions, such as the sadistic surgeon played by Charles Coburn in King's Row, Hollywood had hitherto generally portrayed the medical profession in a good light, so the idea that doctors and nurses could be murderous villains rather than selfless, idealistic healers was no doubt shocking.The film also makes good use of its setting. As another reviewer has pointed out, many thrillers make use of dark, claustrophobic settings, so it must have been a challenge to the ingenuity of writer/director Michael Crichton, himself a former doctor, to conjure up an atmosphere of suspense in a cold, clinical, brightly lit hospital. (Alfred Hitchcock took on a similar challenge in North by North West when he succeeded brilliantly in creating a sense of menace during the crop-duster sequence, set in daylight in the flat, wide open Illinois prairie). Some of the suspense sequences in Coma have a particularly macabre quality to them, especially the scene where Susan is menaced by a villain in a refrigerator filled with corpses in body-bags.Michael Douglas (in one of his earliest starring roles as Mark) is adequate but seldom more than that. He gives little indication that he was on the verge of stardom as one of Hollywood's biggest names of the eighties and nineties. Genevieve Bujold, however, is rather better as Susan, making her an attractively determined heroine, and there are good supporting performances from Richard Widmark as Dr Harris, Susan's paternalistic boss who may not be all he seems, and from Elizabeth Ashley as Mrs Emerson, the weird, zombie-like nurse (a sort of Stepford Wife of the medical world) at the sinister Jefferson Institute where the coma patients are taken. One can also spot a few stars of the future in minor roles, such as Tom Selleck, Ed Harris and Bond-Girl-to-be Lois Chiles as Nancy.There are (as others have pointed out) a number of holes in the plot- I could not, for example, understand why the medical establishment of the hospital were so complacent about the number of patients they were losing to coma. I won't detail the other plot-holes as to do so would be to give away too much of the plot. These are not, however, the sort of weaknesses that are likely to spoil one's enjoyment of the film, but rather the sort that become apparent when one sits down to analyse it later, or when one sees it for a second time (as I did recently). Some commentators have called this film Hitchcockian. Whereas in quality it is by no means up to Hitchcock at his best, it is a reasonably exciting, if modest, thriller. 6/10 "},{"Title":"Nancy Drew for grown-ups","Date":"8 January 2011","Score":"2 out of 5 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama, Horror, Mystery","Review":" A mediocre yet nonetheless entertaining thriller starring Geneviève Bujold as a resident who discovers that very sinister things are going on the prestigious Boston hospital she's working at.

April 10, 2006. Remembering when I interviewed Mr. Goldsmith for Billboard Magazine while Editor of Radio/TV in L.A. (1979-80) It was one of the biggest thrills in my print journalism career of 35+ yrs. in both the mainstream & gay news media.His music MAKES the movie, which was well-written, cast and acted. You can hear future scores-of-his (The Omen) as well as his 1st major film (A Patch of Blue) which knocked me out during my freshman year at New Mexico Highlands University in Las Vegas, N.M. That's still one of my fav soundtrack scores of his in my book! Even in 2006, the theme of Coma strikes a REAL chord about health care. Re Terry Sciavo & the right-to-die. Funny, sad (?) & pathetic how since 1978 these issues are still NOT adequately or at all addressed by our so-called political and/or religious leaders? Think about it!

I went to the doctor today and he gave me only six months to live.  I said, Six months!!  Oh, my God, I want a second opinion!  The doctor said, You want a second opinion?  Okay, you're ugly too.Well, it might or might not be funny, but it's not as funny as the plot in this movie.  Genevieve Bujold, cute as a button and sassy too, uncovers a plot to bootleg organs at a profit from unwilling young donors.  Richard Widmark is sinister, but not Tommy Udo sinister, just -- untrustworthy.  Rip Torn as the chief of anaesthesiology is more blatantly alienating.  Michael Douglas is blandly handsome, but relaxed and comforting.  Elizabeth Ashley, also sinister, overplays the part to such an extent that she comes over as something Kim Hunter might have stumbled across in the cane fields in I Walked With a Zombie.  She alone is at least as amusing as that joke up there.  There's a hit man who wears a single expression in all his appearances.  The other players are competent.  I especially like the bed-ridden patient, Mr. Schwartz, who is examined by Dr. Douglas.  Douglas tells him, You're going to be fine, Mr. Schwartz.  That's what you think, says Schwartz, rolling over in disgust.  The settings are well used,  The frighteningly sterile ex-IBM building in Massachussetts.  The highly polished hospital corridors.  The gorgeous seaside scenery which looks like Barnstable or someplace although it is actually California.  We learn something of how operations are carried out too, thanks to a surgeon who guides us through the process of inducing anaesthesia, and to a pathologist whom we can watch at work, rather like the guy behind the counter in a deli who slices the salami.  We must also take note of Jerry Goldsmith's post-Chinatown creepy score, including some bone-chilling pizzicato.Now, the plot per se doesn't need to be completely dissected because we know who the murderers are already.  So we'll simply partially disarticulate it.  Abduct the plantar surface, please.  Feather.  Thank you. (1)  Bujold is one tough cookie allright.  A thoroughly seasoned doctor.  Yet, when she finds herself in a kind of freezer filled with hanging bodies ready for the dissection room she goes all to pieces, collapsing in Douglas's arms and shivering with fear -- The bodies!  The bodies!  (2) Doctor Torn, concerned about the rather reckless number of cryptogenic comas that have suddenly cropped up, goes through the patients' records thoroughly, looking for a common element but finds none.  If there were something there, don't you think we'd have found it? he asks Bujold.  The only thing he's missed, as it turns out, is something a sight-challenged person would notice immediately, namely that all the unfortunate incidents took place in Operating Room 8.  (3)  Correctly suspecting that she is being followed by a murderer, Bujold dashes down the stairway of an almost empty hospital and bumps into an old friend on his way to the medical library.  She asks if she can walk with him and, pleased, he agrees.  He's her protection, you see.  However, he is held up momentarily by a conversation on the wall phone, while the hit man hovers palpably in the background.  What would you do in her place?  What does SHE do?  She smiles good-bye at her friend and walks off to try to find a hiding place alone.  (4) Twice, Bujold manages to delay the murderer and dash out of his sight and finds another unlikely hiding place.  The hit man doesn't have to search for her, however.  He unerringly goes directly to the correct door, smashes the glass, and enters the room.  (5)  The viewer ordinarily hears the other end of any phone conversation.  But when Bujold overhears Douglas speaking quietly into a phone, saying suspicious things like, She's okay.  She's here right now, when the hit man and the other members of the conspiracy are still after her, we don't hear whom Douglas is talking to, so we can believe along with Bujold that Douglas is in cahoots with the perps.  (6)  There is what Roger Ebert calls the semi-obligatory romantic interlude in which Bujold and Douglas take a weekend vacation at the shore, chasing each other through the surf, rolling in the sand, strolling arm in arm on the boardwalk, having a romantic dinner in a seaside restaurant, while Goldsmith's violins provide an uncharacteristically pleasant support.  (7)  Bujold has a nightmare and when she wakes from it, she shouts and thrusts herself up from the bed, shoving her face shockingly close to the camera's lens.  Well -- okay, I see the last two points are not holes in the logic of the plot, just rusty cliches, but symptoms consistent with necrosis of the imagination nonetheless.  (8)  Bujold has just managed to trap the hit man in the refrigerator full of hanging bodies and has bolted the door from the outside.  The guy has a silenced pistol with him and has shot one or two holes through the cadavers.  Now Bujold is in a position to prove to everyone that she's not paranoid, as they've been arguing.  I mean, this murderer is safely locked inside the reefer until someone lets him out.  And when Bujold then runs to Douglas to tell him about it, she turns to jelly, becomes hysterical, begins speaking gibberish, and sounds like a raving lunatic instead of the independent and resourceful panzer she's been so far.  And at this point, the plot forgets all about the hit man locked up in the reefer, as if he had never existed.  (9)  Well, this is a huge hospital -- Mass General, in fact.  It must have an equally huge basement, correct?  Having received a hint from a workman that there is a clue to the conspiracy located somewhere down there, Bujold finds it among the furnaces, boilers, tanks, and electronic junk in roughly one minute, as if having sniffed it out.  What alerts her?  An ordinary green oxygen tank, with an ordinary tube, which she tracks to its source.  (10) As she's being wheeled off to OR 8 for the appendectomy which will undo her -- and we get another cliche here the patient's point of view of the ceiling and the hovering face as the gurney is wheeled down the corridor -- she is accompanied by Douglas, who still believes her conspiracy theory is nonsense.  Drugged, she nevertheless manages to convince him that there is evidence in the basement.  If it took her one minute to find the evidence, it takes him even less time.  He dashes down the stairs to the basement, up the ladder, following the evil tube, uncovers what looks like the innards of a table radio from 1933, and plucks at the offending wires in it, causing a shower of sparks and saving a life.  Well, that's that.  Will you close the patient up, please?  I've pretty much made fun of it because the plot really is silly, sometimes irritatingly so.  Yet I watch it fairly often because it's well done.  Crichton never was and never has been an artist -- either as a novelist or a director -- but he's shown himself to be a good, commercially oriented techie.  It's a colorful and engaging movie, and if you can relax your critical faculties, or better yet, anaesthetize them, you'll enjoy it, from beginning to end.

This is a movie that I would never in a million years be a fan of today, although I will admit it scared the heck out of me when I was a kid.On the plus side, it's an interesting medical thriller with acting that was (at least I remember it as being) very very good. However, on the minus side, the story is just to morbid. And the  movie pushes scares on you in a very obvious way.I think the book Coma has held up better simply because the story works better as a book then a movie in the first place. This is suspencful but in a very grim way.And it's the type of movie that might be fun to view ONCE but doesn't hold up at all to a second viewing. And also, some of the scenes that worked so well in the book just don't work in the movie-EXAMPLE(SPOILER)-When Sue is being chased and winds up surrounded by all those bodies-that was a RIDICULOUS scene in the movie version-in the book it seems credible-in the movie it comes off as a very obvious way to elicit gasps from the audience.I would say, if one is interested in the story of Coma try to find the book first before seeing the movie. Not that the book is exactly perfect but its eons better and works more as a medical mystery/thriller then a wanna be medical thriller/almost horror.

This movie is one of those typical well build up thrillers from the '70's, that however in the end still falls sort of flat, due to some improbabilities in the story.The movie begins slow, perhaps unnecessarily slow, to set up the characters and their relations. It does give the movie a certain sense of realism and at times suspense but it also provides the movie with some unnecessary long sequences that don't really add enough to the movie and its style. It's has '70's written all over it but the movie is not as 'experimental' as other genre movies from the same period. The cinematography by Victor J. Kemper is without any fancy tricks and the musical score by Jerry Goldsmith is (disappointingly) simple. All indications that this movie was made in the late '70's. It still has '70's style but without all the movie technical experimental elements, like genre movies from the more early '70's. It does make this movie more watchable for a wider audience.Basically from a technical point of view, the thriller elements in this movie are well build up and executed in the movie but unfortunately the story itself is filled with too many loose ends and improbabilities to consider this a perfectly made thriller. Too bad, since the premise itself of the movie is quite good. Especially in the end the movie becomes more and more unlikely. For instance why only just O.R. 8? Wouldn't that just arouse automatically suspicious after a while? And why does Susan Wheeler keep returning to the hospital, were she knows that she has more enemies than friends. All logically flawed plot elements that causes the movie to be a bit unlikely and not always credible as a thriller.It's nice to see that the main character of the movie is a female. Geneviève Bujold delivers a strong performance in the main lead. I don't know, for some reason the movie also becomes more realistic because of that the main lead is a female. With a male lead movies like these too often and too easy turn into heroic macho movies, which are not halve as credible. The movie also has a very solid supporting cast, with lots of actors that later grew out to be big ones, such as of course Michael Douglas but also Rip Torn, Tom Selleck and Ed Harris, who portray some much smaller roles.Overall this still is one fine typical '70's thriller. As long as you can see past its flawed script and don't expect too much of a masterpiece, you'll certainly enjoy watching this movie. 7/10http//bobafett1138.blogspot.com/ "},{"Title":"SPOILER - Memorably bad movie","Date":"11 September 2004","Score":"0 out of 4 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama, Horror, Mystery","Review":"  I recommend this film because it's so bad it transcends what it was meant to be and is instead something infinitely more satisfying.

Coma tries to answer this question in a Hitchcock-ian fashion, creating a creepy atmosphere as it goes along and its effort is admirable, but the end result sadly doesn't satisfy the hopes. Convincing anybody that in order to try and save patients needy of organs other random healthy patients are killed, is absurd and beyond imagination of the greatest fool. In 90% of my comments I never summarize the plot but the villainous doctor's reasoning that it's better to kill healthy people in order to save sick patients than just leave the healthy people be is so stupid its offensive.But if you cut the last 10 minutes Coma is fairly decent and the leading lady, a sort of version of a much more feminine Sigourney Weaver, quickly grows on you.

A very silly film that will have a doctor checking for your pulse. One interesting thing though (if you're all sitting comfortably). During 'the sinister clinic scene' (ooh!)
