[{"Title":"A stylish slasher. One of the bests from the 80's.","Date":"6 May 2005","Score":"26 out of 34 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Horror","Review":" Tobe Hooper's straight slasher flick deserves a chance. We admire this genius for Poltergeist and especially Texas Chainsaw Massacre but it's fair to recognize the good job he did with The Funhouse.The movie is creepy itself because of it's colorful but creepy setting and atmosphere. I mean, how could something go wrong in the fun house? Well, when there's a freak wearing a Frankenstein mask killing other weird people you can imagine that things could get nasty. The premise is well known. Two couples go to the amusement park at night and soon after they arrive they enter the fun house and witness how a freak kills a woman. That's when the typical killing starts as the freak and his father chase the teens in order to hide the murder.Overall there are some very creepy moments like when the freak takes off his mask revealing his disfigured head, when this freak slaughters a girl with his claws, the crazy witch, the puppets, and the death scenes. Hooper's direction is top class as always. He put a lot of effort in a low budget slasher flick and that's why he deserves some credit. I'm not saying that he wasted his talent on a movie that doesn't asks much for it; I think that this is one of the best looking and directed slasher flicks of all time. There are some camera angles that looked very innovative for it's time (example, Richie's dead body in the moving wagon). The acting is quite good for a movie like this. I felt sorry for the kids when murdered. Also, the cinematography is quite impressive. The movie is from 1981 and looks very good. The correct use of light in dark settings helped a lot and gave a creepy look to the fun house. The F/X is also good. The freak looks gruesome and horrible in a positive way. The gore is okay. The Funhouse is definitely a must see for fans of the genre. I can say that this is one of the best slasher flicks out there. The movie is not only about a demented killer chasing teens but it has some truly suspense moments and the effective jump-out of your seat scenes. Recommended for horror fans in general; this is another Tobe Hooper classic that shouldn't be missed.I wonder if this movie inspired Hooper to make The Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2. There are some similarities between the two movies; for example, the freak trying to abuse on a girl, the setting, the child abuse (uh, the freak is often beaten and yelled by his father), some death scenes, the ending, etc. "},{"Title":"As Nightmares Go, This One's About As Terrifying As It Gets...","Date":"5 December 2008","Score":"22 out of 27 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Horror","Review":" Up until THE FUNHOUSE, Tobe Hooper had only come pretty close to recapturing the relentless and ruthlessly nightmarish feel of the classic that catapulted him to fame, THE Texas CHAINSAW MASSACRE. TCM 2 came closer than most of his films, but it traded in psychological terror for buckets of blood 'n' guts, where the first TCM had very little.THE FUNHOUSE goes back to Hooper's roots, trading in the gore for playing with your nerves like Jimmy Page playing guitar. Traveling carnivals have always had a sinister, menacing undertone to them - that's part of what makes them so attractive - and Hooper, with a smart assist from Larry Block's script, takes that queasy unease and turns it up to '11', so that when the true horror is revealed, it's intensified that much more.Four friends on a double date (Elizabeth Berridge, Miles Chapin, Cooper Huckabee and Largo Woodruff) decide to hole up in the Funhouse of a traveling carnival just outside of town way past closing time, just for kicks. It's a weird place that gives off a freaky vibe, but they don't come to realize just how freaky, until they see something that puts all of their lives in danger, and realize to their horror that not all the freaks in the show are fake...or at all fun.I don't want to spoil the surprises, but as is his habit, Hooper front-loads the movie with some acting vets, including genre favorites William Finley and Sylvia Miles. Plus the great Kevin Conway plays a pivotal role in bringing about the terror and death that the seemingly endless night holds for the trapped teens.Anyone expecting Hooper and company to just pour on the gore is bound to be disappointed. THE FUNHOUSE is more about empathy and atmosphere...I mean, who HASN'T been through a funhouse like this at some time in their lives? The more you can put yourself in the place of the main characters, the spookier the film will be for you - especially in the third act.Kudos to everybody for putting in some damn good performances, but especially to Berridge and to Wayne Doba who gives us a monster that is by turns pathetic, disgusting, pitiful and horrifying. And for John Beal, who created a score that plays with your nerves just as powerfully as the visuals do.This is one of those best viewed alone, with the sound up and all the lights out...And don't worry - if you screech like a little schoolgirl at some parts, it'll be our secret, I promise...(hehheh) "},{"Title":"For horror fans, The Funhouse is just that!","Date":"22 September 2005","Score":"22 out of 28 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Horror","Review":" From director Toby Hooper (The Texas Chainsaw Massacre-1974) comes this above average slasher-thriller film, that's certainly one of the best of the '80's!Teenagers go to the county fair on a double date.

Two couples visiting the local traveling carnival decide to spend the night in The Funhouse and fool around as a lark. After witnessing a murder, they become the targets of a deformed maniac and his barker dad who are determined they will not leave to report it to the police. I read the Owen West (aka Dean Koontz) novelization back in the day, which was infinitely more padded with back story, abortion issues, religious fanaticism, and a rather Byzantine attempt to link the heroine and her younger brother to the killers before they ever set foot on the midway. Mercifully, the film abandons all of the excess baggage and strips the story done to the bare essentials. I enjoy Tobe Hooper's direction here much more so than that shown in the original Texas Chainsaw Massacre as it seems we are seeing a much more polished effort. He nicely establishes the atmosphere of the midway, which by turns is colorful and sordid. The central characters are nicely delineated (although due to the abandoning of the subplots from the novelization, Shawn Carson's younger brother seems like a fifth wheel rather than integral to the story) and well played by an appealing cast. They seem like credible and overwhelmed young people rather than fodder for the axing. Lead Elizabeth Berridge, in particular, has a nice girl next door quality and radiates a resourcefulness through her terror without ever seeming like either Superwoman or a victim. The make-up for the primary killer is particularly effective and novel. The film builds up a substantial head of steam before going for broke in a wild Grand Guignol climax. The score is also worth mentioning as it provides a very effective counterpoint to the action. Ironically, this film is rarely mentioned by horror fans, having been buried amid the morass of Friday the 13th clones that proliferated in this period, but it is definitely one that should be rediscovered. "},{"Title":"Cosmic prank","Date":"31 July 2012","Score":"13 out of 17 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Horror","Review":" Along with every other horror fan out there, I have been puzzling about Tobe Hooper. Texas Chainsaw features highly in my list of favorite films. At least two of his other films are really worthwhile, one of them right here. But, it all quickly unraveled for him and by the time he had moved on to Cannon in the mid-80's, he was pretty much over as a filmmaker. I think the crux of the problem is that he was not Hollywood material. He seems to have been a shy and almost asocial presence on his own sets, a kind of droopy, charmless guy, bullied off The Dark by the crass Kinski, sidestepped in Poltergeist by the more agile Spielberg, which can be viewed in Europe as the kind of quality that signifies an artist, but the Hollywood environment requires someone to direct the crowded set and costly , complicated production, and that means energetic decision-makers of some persuasive wit and strong character. You see, he did not come up through the Hollywood system at all. He was a documentary cameraman in the 60's and you can see that in his best work. He did Chainsaw in a close circle of friends, away from Hollywood fanfare. It just didn't seem like he could muster the ego for necessary friction to see that vision through (the drug problems were probably ways to cope with that). His own fault was that he couldn't find it in him to cut out on his own.At any rate, I consider Hooper our loss. The guy had a genuine vision and that vision is prized by me, even snippets of it like we have here. Here's an easy riddle the film is typical in the slasher vein about a group of teens stranded after-hours in a funhouse. Its singular call to fame now is that it was once part of that notorious list of Nasties. Now that list is dumb and arbitrary in a number of ways, but why this nearly bloodless film? Why not Friday the 13th?But of course for the same reason that Texas Chainsaw got an R rating. The very fabric and walls of the thing are violence.Oh, a lot of what's inside including the storyline and bad guys is silly or simply mediocre, and mainly put together from bankable horror elements, from jump-scares to ruby-red color filters, which is after all the gist of a funhouse the horror house is fun because you anticipate the elements and staging, and look forward to this being controlled around you. The opening that slyly takes us from a re-enactment of famous scenes in Halloween and Psycho through a Frankenstein poster on the wall to Bride of Frankenstein playing on TV, is Hooper's way of commenting on the redressing of spare parts he's going to use.That's fun and really a lot of the film is, but not genuine vision. Hooper's vision is something more powerful than either Carpenter or Argento, both effective in other respects, were doing on this level, and that is the place itself is causing evil. It was dumbed-down by Spielberg in Poltergeist - written by him but a Hooper-originated project - as an actual force in the walls, and all sorts of gizmos and movie effects were brought around to clarify. But it was something altogether different to a 'haunted house' effect in its original conception.Chainsaw is the most pure in this regard. But, it's a recurring feature in Eaten Alive, Salem's Lot, Poltergeist, and this. Hooper explained it as a 'physical sensation' he was after. I think it's something more he achieved.There is violent energy in the gears and walls of the world, and it's the turning of those gears much more than storybased character decisions that control and manifest the energy as a kind of semiconscious , animal evil in the narrative of the film. You can observe that the 'Funhouse' extends and anticipates the actual physical place (opening scene - dog - shotgun guy). It's something mischievous in the air. In our film, all of it is centered on a imaginative kid on his way to the scary place. That kid is scared out of consciousness. Shots of the unconscious kid are intercut with shots of the terrified teenagers trapped inside the maze. And there is the enigmatic shot of the boy saying nothing about that to the parents.This is brilliant. The boy pulled a prank and expects one back from his sister, the cosmic prank that shatters lives is the universe conspires to stage the real thing.Nothing of this registers directly, because we are distracted by the much more ordinary monster in the narrative (initially Frankenstein).The entire last 20 minutes are a zap of cinematic energy from these cosmic gears that create and destroy the monster that is the prank that throws the world helter skelter (the finale takes place in a staging area full of gears).Why? Because the god of the machine is watching (as the old crone cackles about) and wants to be amused.Make no mistake, this is the sister film to Texas Chainsaw.

During the night, they witness the murder of the fortune teller Madame Zena (Sylvia Miles) by a man wearing a mask of Frankenstein from an opening in the ceiling of a room. They decide to leave the fun house but they find all the exits locked. Meanwhile Richie sneaks in the room and steals the money of the manager of the place. The masked man returns with his father and owner of the fun house to show the corpse of Madame Zena; when the man realizes that he had been robbed, he presses his son that removes the mask and shows his horrible face. Richie startles and drops his lighter in the room. The owner asks his freak son to chase the thieves and eyewitnesses in a night of terror for the teenagers. Funhouse is a good low-budget slash movie and as usual based on the stupidity of a group of teenagers, especially Richie that is an irritating character. The cast is formed by unknown actors and actresses and Miles Chapin seems to be repeating his performance in Hair with another imbecile character. Tobe Hooper uses the entertainments in the fun house to keep a creepy atmosphere, but the movie could be shorter. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil) Pague para Entrar, Reze para Sair (Pay to Get In, Pray to Get Out)Note On 02 April 2015, I saw this movie again.

They are gone, they are gone. The freak show was the best-part of any carnival, as any carny-goer will attest, and a great-time for scaring-the-ladies. One would be-regaled by the carnie-barkers as to the mysteries-within the two-headed cows, the mutant-babies and the stillborn-infants, the cock with four-legs, the bearded-ladies, the rubber-faced freaks, the geeks, and the mummified-mermaids and Old west-yeggs. All this got swept-away by the scions of political-correctness of all-political-persuasions. And where did that leave the freaks? Homeless. If the freak show gave the public anything-at-all, it was the sureness that there were indeed others worse-off than ourselves, and we supported-them. The good-news is, people like Jim Rose have resurrected this era, and here's to more! The film is possibly the finest stalk-and-slash of the era it was made-in, and the opening-scene is a very-funny homage to the shower-scene in Hitchcock's Psycho. The majority-of the action takes-place at the carnival, and the funhouse, but there are some great expositions of the entire-carnival (Hooper even inserts a man covered-in-blood into a crowd-shot to see if we're paying-attention). We see a striptease-tent, the freak show, and even some of the lives of the carnies, and it's definitely well-researched. The colors and the grotesqueness of ALL carnivals is here, on-display, and there are some interesting aside-comments on why we go to them. Often, it is mystery and curiosity, and that is the heart of the film--discovery-as-horror-reveal.And so, the kids go to the carnival, and stay-the-night in the funhouse on-a-dare, voyeuristically-invading the lives of the carnies. Before-long, they have witnessed-a-murder by the carny in the Frankenstein-mask...who might-not be-human. But, Hooper has forewarned-us of everything, including the mutant-killer in the earlier freak show scenes (the bifurcated-head of the cow, the mutant-fetus, and other-shots). It just builds-and-builds to the hysterical-ending, growing more-and-more ominous. There are many-many-scenes that are simply atmospheric--crucial to any effective-horror.As-usual, any great horror-film has its stand-out actor, and in-this-case, it is Kevin Conway. His triple-roles as the funhouse-barker, the strip-tent barker, and the freak show barker are simply-classic. Without-him, The Funhouse would not be nearly-so-good. Like many of Tobe Hooper's horror-films, this story concerns a family, or multiple-ones under-attack. There are a few-moments where it is truly-difficult not to feel-pity for the deformed-killer, as it is obvious his life has been miserable and abusive. If you don't have some empathy for the monster in a horror-film, you don't have a very-good story.There is an incredible-scene--possibly the best in the film--in-which the main female-protagonist lands in the machine-room of the funhouse. It is highly-orchestrated, and expresses a fear of the mechanical, with steam-blasting pumps, pulleys, gears, and timed-noise. It is probably Hooper's best-constructed scene in any of his films for sheer hysteria and tension--excepting the dinner-party in Texas Chainsaw Massacre, because the hysteria was real. Also-noteworthy, is the score by John Beal. It has the Bernard Hermann-style of descending-scales, and a skill for-creating atmosphere. The Universal-DVD is perfect, with superior image and audio-quality. This film will be-remembered, later-on, as one of Tobe Hooper's best.

That being said, I consider the 1980s the grandest time for the horror genre.  You had fine slasher movies like Friday the 13th, Nightmare On Elm Street, My Bloody Valentine, and Prom Night.  You also had great monster/ghost/zombie movies like The Howling, Day of the Dead, and The Fog. Well, the Funhouse falls right in the middle of the these subgenres.  The story centers around Amy and her three friends (two guys and a girl), who, after seeing all the ghoulish and bizarre attractions at the carnival, decide to have a lock-in at the Funhouse for a night of hanky-panky. Well, a lock-in they get, followed by a night of sheer terror as the foursome witness a murder by the carnival's secret attraction, the hideously deformed freak, and become the target of the Funhouse's maniacal operators. Who will survive?  Will any survive?  And what kind of trauma will they have to endure?  For those that are into blood and guts, this movie will probably not do it for you, because it doesn't contain much.  But for those of you who love a great horror movie with suspense, a claustrophobic atmosphere, and a grainy touch, this chiller is for you.  I personally give it my highest recommendation.  I truly believe that it is a forgotten classic. After all, it was Tobe Hooper, of Texas Chainsaw Massacre and Poltergeist fame, who helmed this gem.  Even the tagline for this movie was perfect Pay to get in.  PRAY to get out.  And thank God that J.D. Roth wasn't in this film.

Rumor was circulating that kids in another county were killed at that carnival in the past. But they ignore the father, craft a really thin lie (the old sleeping at a friend's house routine), and go anyway. And then comes the big idea stay overnight in the funhouse. This plan goes fine until the kids witness a fortune teller slash prostitute get murdered by the man in the Pat Sajak mask.Tobe Hooper, the director, is a big name in horror. Texas Chainsaw Massacre and Poltergeist are modern classics. I don't claim to be an expert on Hooper -- I've seen only a handful of his work -- but I would rank this near the top of the list. I have read other reviews calling this film, without hesitation, Hooper's best work, and I think they make a strong case. While the least known of the big three Hooper films, it has a timelessness to it that will strike terror in people's hearts forever.Carnivals are scary. From Carnival of Souls to the more recent Dark Ride, the background of a circus can be chilling. Throw in some clowns, carnival barkers and automated robots (dolls that move) and you have the perfect set-up. You don't really need a masked killer to heighten the fear, but Hooper throws one in anyway. If nothing else can be said about this movie, you can say the perfect atmosphere was created for winning film.Beyond that, we have the same old horror standards. Teenagers making out, smoking pot and being stupid. We have a main character -- Amy Harper (Elizabeth Berridge) -- who is quite sexy, although her taste in men needs some adjustment (I'm sorry, but I thought Buzz Klemmet (Cooper Huckabee) was a jerk). And getting busy on the first date after not hitting it off well? Believable for some reason. Unlike her female co-star (Largo Woodruff), they find ways to get her topless multiple times in the film. I'm not complaining, but the real mystery is this why didn't we see her in more 1980s films? I think the defining moment for this movie is when the mask is removed from the killer. I won't reveal anything that will spoil it, but I have to say that the man under the mask was quite the shocker for this first-time viewer. You think you know, but you have no idea.Absolutely see The Funhouse. 1970s and 1980s horror is a defining era for the genre, and this film sits right near the top of some of the best works. Possibly eclipsing Texas Chainsaw Massacre and comfortably resting with Halloween (a film this one pays homage to in the opening scene), Hooper has made a name for himself. More recent contributions -- such as The Damned Thing -- are lacking, but classics like The Funhouse will guarantee him a slot in the Horror Movie Hall of Fame, if such a thing existed.

For anyone interested in the appeal of a traveling carnival, this film has some great sets.  The Funhouse also features some great Rick Baker/Craig Reardon effects in the form of the movie's villain, a deformed albino with fangs and claws.But the rest of the production is sorely lacking.  Tobe Hooper does his best with the material, but he's not too good at smoothing over the obvious lack of logic inherent in the film.  For instance, the plot concerns a small group of four teenagers who decide on a lark to spend the night in the funhouse of the traveling carnival they're visiting...the same carnival that was around when those two girls were found dead in the woods some time ago.  Now, why on Earth would anybody in their right minds find the idea of staying in a carnival funhouse overnight exciting?  Where will they sleep?  What will they do the next day?  Won't they get hungry?  Thirsty?  Have to brush their teeth?  Use the bathroom?Not only that, but the attractions in this carnival are most definitely not of the transportable variety.  The titular dark ride seems so immense that our teen protagonists find it impossible to navigate their way out of the funhouse when danger rears its ugly head.  Here's an idea maybe follow the metal tracks in the floor until you are standing at the exit?  In fact, the funhouse is built like a permanent fixture, with at least two floors and what appears to be a sub-basement!  How would the carnies ever be able to dismantle this thing and move it in one day?This flick also suffers another blow by giving us nobody to root for.  The teenage protagonists are wholly unlikeable.  They smoke pot like they're sipping soda out of a can, they steal money from strangers, they are stupid enough to want to spend the night in a carnival attraction, and they commit the unpardonable horror movie sin of fornication--all except for the female lead, of course, although she isn't even interesting enough to be engaging.  The dialogue in the film is flat, and it has no success in establishing any characterizations on behalf of the would-be victims.  I wasn't even paying attention to most of the film's first reel.  The Funhouse is also one of those movies where the villains seem to know exactly where their victims will be standing, like directly on top of a trap door that is conveniently deployed right on cue.  The machinery of the funhouse also knows exactly how to deposit dead bodies so that they will stop exactly in front of our screaming victims.Suspension of disbelief aside, The Funhouse stirs up some uncomfortable feelings when the filmmakers use their monster to get scares out of the audience, then tell us he's simply deformed.  In reality, he is one of the only sympathetic characters in the movie, and the film's climax is the only portion that packs a wallop the script pits the only two characters in the film worth caring about against one another.Hooper throws in some sly references to Texas Chain Saw Massacre, even if it does involve the gratuitous and illogical use of swinging hooks (haw haw), but by the time the movie delivers any real shudders, it's too late.  Ironically, Dean Koontz was hired to write a movie tie-in novel for The Funhouse, which was published under the psuedonym Owen West.  Koontz fleshed out the story considerably, adding some great touches that the filmmakers would have been wise to exploit in their own movie.  Too bad, because Koontz's treatment may have given Hooper a bigger, sharper hook on which to hang this film.

The Funhouse is slow movie and that's actually a good thing about it. It tries to develop the characters and yes it does successes on some levels, you actually care for characters. Lead actress, always lovely Elizabeth Berridge who plays Amy is sweet and looks very innocent here, even if she does reveal her boobs in one scene (actually two), but anyway, her character is very sweet and you care for her during the whole hide and seek period.

Typologically, a Funhouse is a building which is not inhabited by humans, but by projections of human fantasy whose motives are basically taken from Old-World legends and mythologies, in some modern cases also from horror movies (zombies, aliens, Freddy Krueger, Bela Lugosi, etc.). Normally, you drive alone or as a couple in a wagon called vehicle that has either the form of an open car or an engine (hence Ghost Train) on a single or double rail along which there are contacts by which the passing wagon makes the appearances move, shine and utter sounds. Since most modern appearances are quite realistic, it is only a short step to think that they could become actually alive. However, The Funhouse falls not into this cheap trap to show as robots with alleged free will, but carefully maintains the Poly-con-textural border between the ghosts and their operators. As a matter of fact, this movie serves a lot of unexpected or rather seldom scary effects and thus belongs definitely to the best representatives of Slasher Movies. The idea, however, that there is actually no escape from a Funhouse-building is an invention In Europe as well as in the United States, such theme-buildings must have roofs that can be removed in no time in the case of a fire-emergency. Also, they must have clearly indicated emergency exists as well as water connections in the case that a Funhouse is a non-ambulant building (a building which is not transported, as the one shown in the movie, from fairground to fairground). Since I belong to the possibly very few people in this world who actually had several times the possibility to walk through enlightened Funhouses, Dark Rides and Ghost Trains, I can assure you that this movie - quite unlike Ghost Drive - does a hell of a job in showing you the inside of such a theme-park building which is normally as secret to public as the election of the pope is.

A fascinating subtext running through the story is that it is a variation on the tragedy of Dr. Frankenstein and his monster. In Tobe Hooper's tale, the monster is one born of genetic mutation, cleverly foreshadowed by the Freak Animals Alive tent exhibit, where the fetal brother of the monster floats in a jar as an abominable attraction for the hoi polloi.Indeed, in the film's opening sequence, the Frankenstein monster is shown, first as a poster showing the Glenn Strange characterization (my favorite!), and then as a Mego doll&#151;oh sorry, action figure&#151;carried by the young boy, Joey, whose sister soon curses him because of his bizarre prank that scares the wits out of her. Joey's actions are also another subtext running through the film he dons a mask to become a monster that frightens his sister, and the actual monster wears a Frankenstein mask to become less of a monster, and therefore less frightening to others. It is interesting to note that, unlike the current spate of horror films that feature eye (popping)-candy and little else, in this film, the characters are presented with choices, yet consistently make the wrong ones. And as we all know, in a horror film, when you make the wrong choices, someone, or more likely today everyone, winds up dead. Amy, Buzz, Liz, Ritchie, and Joey consistently make the wrong choices, and suffer the dire consequences. In the tale of Dr. Frankenstein and his monstrous creation, wrong choices also led to death and disaster, but at least here we have the Funhouse!The funhouse is surrounded by the carnival, a seedy, grimy affair filled with seedy and grimy denizens. There is a bag lady that looks very much like Grandmama from the Addams Family spouting god is watching you! a homeless man that wonders around like a zombie, a few bums, the past her prime fortune teller and palm reader (well played by Sylvia Miles), the not so magnificent Marco the Magician, and the barkers (three of them superbly played by Kevin Conway as if he were a natural). Properly toned by John Beal's score and Andrew Lazlo's cinematography, the loud and brightly lit carnival facade hides a darker, more primitive underbelly of murderous anarchy, and its nexus is the funhouse, established by Mr. Hooper's use of two tracking crane shots, one at the beginning and one at the ending of the mayhem, that emanate from the funhouse to encompass its surroundings.Our hapless group of monster fodder soon regrets their decision to stay the night in the funhouse, and Joey soon regrets sneaking out from his bedroom&#151;down the trusty-trellis-by-the-window&#151;to visit the carnival. We also learn that the father of the monster has regrets about letting it live, in a scene that contains a wealth of hinted at backstory, but must share responsibility for its actions because of choices he has made. Dean Koontz, in his novelization of the film, includes this back story.The climactic confrontation in the mechanical belly of the funhouse is suitably horrific, yet uses little gore, and, unlike the requisite sequelization antics of many fright films today, provides a definitive and satisfying closure. Unlike the mindless snuff horror approach to today's films, The Funhouse explores themes and provides a story depth that is worth viewing, along with the thrills and chills.

Director Tobe Hooper, responsible for one of the greatest horror movies of all time (TCM) and at least partially responsible for another (Poltergeist), takes a stab (ha!) at the '80s slasher craze. On the surface it seems like just another mental defective/weirdo/lunatic goes on a killing spree movie. Those were hardly rare in the '80s. But it's put together well with stylish direction and ample amounts of suspense. The cast is decent with Elizabeth Berridge doing a fine job as the Final Girl. She also has a nice nude scene at the start of the movie, for all the breast enthusiasts out there. The main flaws with the movie are the pacing in the first hour and the overall familiarity of the material. Still, it's worth a look if you like '80s horror.

I guess I was expecting something low-budget and lame, but that's not the case. This is a top-rate quasi-slasher flick from that era, taking place at a carnival, which is a great location for a horror movie. The plot revolves around two high school couples (Elizabeth Berridge & Cooper Huckabee and Miles Chapin & Largo Woodruff) who spend their double date at the local carnival and foolishly decide to spend the night at the Funhouse where they inadvertently witness a murder. Horror ensues as the masked murderer turns out to be a hideous freak.I discovered why this is such a well-done horror film from that era &#x96; it was made by Tobe Hooper who directed significant horror films like The Texas Chainsaw Massacre (1974), Salem's Lot (1979), Poltergeist (1982) and Crocodile (2000). I realize a lot of people don't appreciate the last one, but I actually prefer it to the other three.The movie's effective because the protagonists represent the typical 17-18 year-old youths from that time period, or any time period really. The story takes its time to establish the characters on their carnival date before the horror goes into overdrive and the acting of the teens is convincing when it does. That's one of the things I like about this movie the most (beyond the carnival atmosphere, that is) &#x96; it's realistic tone. Don't get me wrong, there are things that happen that wouldn't likely happen in real life, like a prop at the Funhouse scaring the youths at precisely the right moment, but generally speaking the tone's very believable, plus there's no goofiness or indications that it's all a joke, as in Crocodile. Both girls are a highlight, particularly Largo Woodruff as Liz. Sylvia Miles appears as the tarot card reader, Madame Zena; she still looked good for being in her late 50s.The freak is played by Wayne Doba who is passionate in his portrayal and extremely credible. Plus the make-up is hideous and memorable. I also liked the depiction of the monster's relationship with his dad, the Funhouse Barker played by Kevin Conway. All-around outstanding job on this front.Unfortunately, the pacing of the film is weak and there are numerous draggy sections, which causes one's mind to wander. This is the only reason I don't rate it higher. The movie would've been more effective if they cut 12-15 minutes of fat, which explains why the video version only runs 80 minutes; that's the version you want to see.The film runs 96 minutes and was shot in North Miami, Florida.GRADE B "},{"Title":"A Tobe Hooper Classic","Date":"21 February 2015","Score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Horror","Review":" Tobe Hooper made this film after the success of The Texas Chainsaw Massacre (1974). After an aborted project (Eaten Alive, 1977) and a telefilm (Salem's Lot, 1981). The film shows a sure directorial skill that would fade little by little after his Lifeforce (1985). The film revolves around a group of teenagers who decides to spend the night inside a dark ride (The Funhouse) and witness a murder between two members of the circus. After this they are hunted by the by the deformed killer and his father and... well, the rest is the usual nerve wrecking scenes. This film had a huge mark on me when I watched it in television in my infancy, I remembered it for long time and unfortunately it was rare to show on TV and since I didn't had a VCR I couldn't watch it anywhere, when I got older I imported it on DVD, which is the copy I own. After a gap of some 15 years, the film still has the sinister mood of my recollection. It is sad that Hooper career followed a downward spiral, none of his films has the force of TTCM, though he came close in Funhouse and with Poltergeist (1982).

Although my all-time favorite movie s the 1981 slasher film My Bloody Valentine, this movie is thrilling, entertaining, funny and creepy all in one. I think my favorite character was the pretty minor magician who scared the pants off an audience when he pulled a prank on them. The acing overall wasn't that good but the soundtrack was memorable and the movie does manage to remain shocking. It also shows a side-story with Amy's little brother getting lost at the carnival while sneaking out after dark.This isn't a bad movie, it's worth watching and really fun to see with friends.

It's a really underrated and overlooked gem from 1981. Perhaps Tobe Hooper's other films have overshadowed this one.Nevertheless, you should definitely add this to your Halloween scary movie repertoire - but it's also just an anytime watch as well. Spoiler ahead (description of ending/climax)There are many great scenes in this film, but WOW! the climax scene is superb. It takes place underneath the Funhouse, in the dark and creepy gears and pulleys/mechanical room. Great idea by Hooper, it's the creepiest part of the Funhouse - the ugly basement/undercarriage.For 3 or 4 minutes, nothing actually happens. The cute protagonist looks around horrified, with plenty of scary music, lightning, and intense cinematography all coming to a crescendo. Then the film comes to its climax, with the terrifying death of the deformed/mute man. The scene takes up about 6 or 7 minutes - which is quite some time for one scene.

Sometimes REALLY creepy. And who really knows what sorts of evil characters a carnival might bring into your town. That kind of thing. And working in close proximity to the State Fairgrounds, which I do, I often see these types a little bit too up close and personal for my liking each Labor Day week. The people we see at the carnival in this film bring a new meaning to the word creepy, though. The story here might not be completely original, but it somehow seems fresh. The film boasts decent production values, and a colorful cast of mostly unknowns. Top it off with a great horror film director, and we almost had a classic here.The story details four young people who visit a carnival and stupidly decide that it would be cool to spend the night in the funhouse after things close down. These four have been smoking weed all night, and maybe that was what caused this incredible lack of judgment. With all of the crazy characters they had met by the time they made this decision, one just simply cannot believe anyone would have done this. Oh, well. They decide to stay, and tragedy soon follows. The ornery drunk who runs the funhouse has a mutant retard for a son who kills a woman after a disastrous attempt at sexual intercourse with her for the price of $100. The four kids, hiding in a loft above, witness this and understandably try to leave. Too late. The father comes back and locks them in. Further complicating matters is the fact that one of the kids stole all the money from the old man's strongbox. It's safe to say that these four kids will not be allowed to leave the facility alive. The old man sicks his mutant son on these teens, and the resulting carnage is very frightening, and not overly gory.The film scores big points for atmosphere, acting, and suspense. You really feel like this is a real carnival full of freaks and geeks. You never know what will be around the corner of each tent, or who will jump out at the actors from the periphery. The opening scene is a wonderful homage to both Psycho and Halloween. Maybe even a slight nod to Kubrick's The Killing. I swear the kid's mask in that scene is a dead ringer for that worn by Sterling Hayden during the heist. The film loses points for their concept of the monster. The mutant son has a good back story, but they didn't create him correctly. Actor Wayne Doba is clearly wearing a mask and it just looks too over-the-top. I would have suggested just making his regular face look ugly with makeup instead of creating this ludicrous mask with fangs whatnot. Doba has the movements this character would make down perfectly, but when he shrieks or cries out, you can tell he's doing it through a mask! It just looks and sounds too fake. Maybe you won't mind as much as I did, but I think the physical appearance of that character needed a different concept.Overall, the film is worth the price of admission, though. I'll give it 7 of 10 stars. Kevin Conway as the midway barker and funhouse proprietor gives a particularly strong and creepy performance. If you thought carnies were creepy before, you really will think they're creepy after watching this! The Hound.

Hooper seems particularly preoccupied with sex in this one, probably having fun over the slasher genre, what with the 4 sex-crazed teenagers (bar Amy, who in the end survives, hehe) deciding to spend the night in the funhouse, or the bag lady insisting that God is watching you, but also with the monster offspring etc.In fact, the sequence where the monster tries to be friendly with Liz is a masterpiece of cynical humour  the crying woman reluctantly offering her services to the sex-crazed man/monster, and in the end back-stabs him. It's only for the better then that Hooper turns to a kind of hallucinated subliminal horror with the last part of the film, which uses the grotesque in toys/clowns/carnivals etc in an imaginative way.

It works best as a companion piece to Chainsaw Massacre sharing and expanding upon many of its chosen themes with rigorous intensity, such as, the idea of malevolent astrology within a fundamentally unreliable world, an emphasis on concealed horror within the image of the terrible house that is associated with the dead weight of the past crushing the young, notions of rural degeneracy that are tied to this, the use of anarchic black humour, class conflict (affluent, permissive white teens who are stalked by a working class monster) in a fragmented society that is on the verge of disintegration, ideas of vegetarianism children are meat, the parallels that he insists on between what is normal/abnormal the repressive patriarchal family unit where mom and dad drink and son and daughter run wild upstairs finds its mirror in the the monstrous all male family and finally the idea of this all coming to an end with an apocalypse.For an 80s horror it is not nearly as reassuring or as conservative as most of the output in that decade. It is also a clever pastiche of Universal monster movies of the 30s and a Hooper's response to John Carpenter's seminal Halloween and the seemingly never ending tide of teenie kill pics that cashed in on its success. Funhouse is a joy to watch and Berridge makes a great 70s-esque final girl who survives more by accident rather than by actively 'taking the monster on'.

Thus is the setting for The Funhouse. Teenager Amy Parker and her friends Liz, Ritchie, and Buzz have piled into Buzz's muscle car for a night at the carnival - the same carnival were some teenage girls had disappeared a year previous. After getting high and taking in a few rides, the group proceeds to take in the freak of nature tent, a magic show, get their fortunes told, and sneak a peek at a girlie show. Towards the end of the evening, Ritchie gets the bright idea to spend the night in the Funhouse, challenging the others to do the same. The four teens enter the Funhouse and proceed to ditch their ride cars. After the carnival closes, the group of kids starts a make out session in the dark&#133; when they hear a noise. Looking through the floorboards, they see that the Funhouse worker Gunther (made up to look like the Frankenstein monster) is paying for sexual favors from the fortuneteller (Sylvia Miles of Midnight Cowboy). When he jumps the gun so to speak, she berates him and refuses to give his money back. This sends Gunther into a frenzy and he proceeds to strangle her to death. Having witnessed this, the kids decide to try to get the hell out of there. Making their way around the darkened corridors with nothing more than a lighter, the foursome try to find the exit. Ritchie discovers the dead body of the fortuneteller and says he's going to check on her to make sure she is in fact dead. When he returns, he finds Buzz has indeed found the exit, but it is a steel door that has been padlocked. They decide to try and see if the entrance is open. On their way towards the front, they see a light wink on below them. The carnival barker has walked into his office and has discovered that Gunther has killed the fortuneteller. Be it that the barker is in reality Gunther's father, he decides that they will get rid of the body and blame it on the local townsfolk. When Gunther gives back the money he took from the cash box to pay the fortuneteller, the carnival barker discovers that the rest of the money is missing. Enraged, he incites Gunther into beating himself up, to the point where he rips the Frankenstein monster mask off&#133; exposing a horribly deformed person underneath. Shocked by what they see, the kids shrink back from the sight, only to lose the lighter through the floorboards. The clatter makes a noise, and the carnival barker stops his tirade with Gunther when he realizes they are not alone...This is one of those movies I BEGGED my parents to see when it first came out. The commercials for it looked AWESOME. Unfortunately as a whole, it did not totally live up to my expectations once I saw it. For one thing, the Funhouse itself is an impossible structure. The thing has a sub basement in it for Pete's sake. This thing is supposed to be mobile? There is no way this thing traveled with the rest of the carnival. Plus, back in the day, there was some false advertising. Two different commercials had been cut. One of these had footage of the two actors (Cooper Huckabee and Elizabeth Berridge) being chased by Gunther through sets that did not even exist in the movie. I hate when production companies do that, as it misrepresents what is up on the movie screen. Of course, the carnival barker firing up everything in the Funhouse well after midnight must have gone over really well with the nearby carnies trying to get some sleep. Back in the day I believe this was made for 2.5 million dollars. Please keep in mind that was a BIG budget for a horror movie. The money definitely went towards the production design. Technically, it is a good movie. All of the moods are there, and the sets for the Funhouse itself are impressive. The music by composer John Beal is tremendous, and adds a lot to the overall flavor of the movie. Noted makeup artists Rick Baker and Craig Reardon did a credible job with the makeup of the deformed Gunther. Unfortunately there was not a lot of articulation in the prosthetic, and it comes off more like a mask at times. Director Tobe Hooper has had a spotty career that has had more ups and downs than a carnival roller-coaster. He of course is known for The Texas Chainsaw Massacre back in the mid 70s, but since then he has had a hard time matching the feel and effect that his initial foray into terror had. This movie is very sluggish at times and even when the action picks up, the pacing feels like it is going in several different directions. As to the death scenes, they are on a whole pretty unspectacular. Mind you, this was back at the height of the early 80s horror resurgence, so it was odd that with such a story and location that so little was done with it. What this movie has going for it is atmosphere, decent acting and good character development.

Hooper doesn't really even show much action for the first half-hour or so showing these teens having a good time, allowing the characters room to develop before lowering the boom on them. The film's opening scene, when a kid brother tease-scares his showering sister(the heroine of the film, Liz Berridge, who was quite good, I felt)Tobe pays homage to Universal monsters(posters of the Frankenstein's monster, Dracula & The Wolf Man on the kid's bedroom walls)Halloween & Psycho..he sure tickled my fancy right off the bat paying tribute to these horror staples. I recommend seeing the wide-screen version of the film so that you can appreciate how well made the movie really is thanks to Tobe's impeccable camera-work. I liked the score, too. Fun cameo by Finley as magician Marco the Magnificent, dressed as a vampire. As usual in a Tobe Hooper film, you get undesirables littered within the carnival setting such as a God will punish you bag lady, a hobo with tattered clothes who seems to pop up when others are walking, an old man spying on strippers through the peep hole of a tent, and some hunter who pulls a rifle on Berridge's kid brother whose following behind his sister to the carnival.

In this stylish slasher movie, two teenage couples go on a double date to a local carnival, despite the fact that two girls were found murdered the year before after the carnival left town. As it gets late and the carnival begins to shut down for the night, the teens decide to spend the night in the funhouse on a dare. While making out, one of the couples notices that they are over a room, and as they peek below they see a man in a Frankenstein costume paying one of the fortune tellers for sex. She refuses, and he ends up ultimately killing her. The teens scramble to get out of the large funhouse in fear, and are chased and attacked by a gruesome, mutated monster type being. Who's going to survive the night in this funhouse?I saw this movie as a young kid and it scared me half to death, but now seeing it years later it isn't quite as frightening, but it's still an imaginative, unique horror movie. A funhouse is a perfect place to set a horror flick, since they are strangely eerie to begin with. The story isn't all too original - it's your typical slasher film with a few spins put on, but the setting is what really makes this movie. The score in the film is strange and creepy, and the set design (particularly the funhouse itself) were done with great taste. And, what better place is there to set a horror film than a carnival? Carnivals are bizarre enough, with all of the oddball people that you encounter there. It's the perfect place to compliment a good horror story because of it's natural strangeness. The ending of the film was abrupt and effective, but very fitting. The final girl escapes, it's morning, and the carnies are opening up everything again, just like any other ordinary day at the carnival. But this poor girl is going to go home by herself, all of her friends dead at the mercy of the carnies.Overall, you have to give Tobe Hooper credit for this one. It's stylish, imaginative, and held my attention the whole way through. The Funhouse is different, but it's one of the more memorable horror films to come from the '80s decade. It may not be an all-time classic like Hooper's Texas Chainsaw Massacre or Poltergeist, but it's surely one of his better films overall. Definitely recommended if you are a fan of Hooper, or enjoy a good old slasher flick. 8/10.

Despite this, it still manages to be entertaining fun from start to finish, delivering some surprisingly good performances and an impressively hideous monster (courtesy of top movie make-up man Rick Baker).Referencing both Psycho and Halloween, Hooper establishes the stalk 'n' slash vibe from the word go by having teen cutie Amy (Elizabeth Berridge) taking a shower in the opening scene. A masked knife-wielding heavy-breather enters the bathroom and attacks Amy, but is subsequently revealed to be her younger brother Joey playing a joke on his sister. Understandably upset at having her brother disturb her whilst she is soaping up her jubblies, Amy tells him she won't be taking him to the carnival.Amy, her new boyfriend, and another couple drive to the carnival where a night of terror awaits them. Meanwhile, Joey sneaks out and makes his own way to the fair&#133;In my opinion, the first half of the movie is the most effective; Tobe Hooper makes the most of his colourful locale, using the bizarre sideshows, strange attractions, and weird people that make up the travelling carnival to create a decidedly unsettling and sinister atmosphere. He also uses strong primary-coloured lighting to accentuate the unreal and dreamlike nature of the setting (a trick he had previously utilised in his 1977 film, Eaten Alive).Once the bodies start to pile up, however, Hooper fails to make the most of the creepy atmosphere he has so carefully constructed, instead giving us a run-of-the-mill second act, in which Amy and pals desperately try to escape from the funhouse as they are gradually picked off one-by-one by the drooling freak.The labyrinthine setting, whilst impressive, seems far too vast and complex to realistically be part of a travelling carnival, and Hooper fails to use it in an effective manner. With a deformed maniac and a whole building's worth of animated mannequins, hydraulic ghosts and mechanical screaming ghouls at his disposal, you would think that Hooper could rustle up a plethora of extreme scares, but he fails to do so. He also expects the audience to swallow the idea that the axes, swords and other props that the ride's mannequins possess would actually be real&#151;not rubber, not plastic, not wood, but cold sharp steel, to be conveniently used by the frightened teens in their bid to stay alive.Hooper also spends far too much time on following Joey as he mooches around the carnival. Since Joey has no particular involvement in the plight of the teens, his inclusion is redundant and best left on the cutting room floor.The film ends as one might expect, with Amy defeating her foe and staggering outside, the sole survivor of the funhouse.Before settling down to watch this movie, I suggest that you try and forget that Hooper is the man who brought us Leatherface; The Funhouse cannot compare with Texas Chainsaw Massacre, so don't even try. That said, despite its flaws, this is still a pretty decent slasher film and I do recommend it to fans of the genre.

Tobe Hooper dined out for years on the over-hyped Texas Chainsaw Massacre churning out derivative horror garbage like Funhouse during the subsequent years.For a movie with a running time of one hour 35 minutes its about 44 minutes before anything remotely interesting happens. The walking talking clichés who enter the carnival do the attractions and then the viewer is taken round some of the attractions again. Yawn. In the meantime the kid brother of one of the main players, having sneaked out of the house and made his way to the carnival wanders around the funfair trying to find his older siblings. This is also really boring. Hooper has mastered the art of stringing out tedium to the point of infinity with a script that could be summarised on the back of a postage stamp. Even factoring in the age of the film, Funhouse is a cliché ridden, poorly acted borefest with a lamentable rubber faced monster. And some people rate this as a masterpiece. Nurse!.

Spielberg struck out with Hook, Stone with U-Turn and Hooper was out to lunch with this poor effort.  Funhouse takes a typical premise but does nothing with it.  Four teens are out for an evening of fun at a carnival and they end up paying for it with their lives.  It is a great idea to have two guys and two girls spend the night in a funhouse but the execution of it is quite banal.  And that is too bad because it had all the ingredients to be quite scary.What is good about the film is the opening which pragmatically tips it's cap to Carpenter's opening shot in Halloween.  It is a nice touch to see a Halloween mask put over the camera as a little boy, heavy breathing and all, walks slowly into the bathroom where his sister is taking a shower and then pretends to stab her with a plastic knife.  The other decent part in the film is when the first guy dies, he is then hit in the head with an axe by one of his friends.  They thought he was the killer coming around a dark corner and they split his head open with an axe.  These two parts were very well done.  The rest of the film is not.The killing doesn't even start until almost an hour into the film.  And that is fine if the movie and the screenplay in particular would have done a better job of setting it up.  But all we get is some inane scenes of the kids going on carnival rides and smooching.  Nothing forbidden is even remotely mentioned about the funhouse except that a couple of years ago a couple of kids were found dead in a funhouse a few states over.  But then they leave it alone.  I wanted to know more about this funhouse a few states over.  How did the kids die?  Was there a suspect?  Was anyone indicted in the murders?  There was nothing to make me afraid for the kids to enter that house.  And that is where the film fails.  Sure the killer is deformed and ugly and blah blah blah but even he isn't that scary.Funhouse is a disappointment but Hooper is to be forgiven.  He directed TCM and Poltergeist and that is a good enough track record to be exonerated from any wrong doing with this film.4 out of 10**** Just a side note.  Has anyone ever given any thought to Hooper being somewhat of an animal rights activist?  I have.  In Texas Chainsaw Massacre, there was great detail not only verbally but visually to the slaughter of animals.  And this one had a carnival full of deformed animals on display for everyone to gawk at.  I can't put my finger on it but there has to be some sort of connection there.  If anyone else has any theories, please email me.  And if that is the case, then kudos to you Mr. Hooper.

It's a common philosophy to imagine what might have been had we reacted to a bad situation in a different way. No matter how successful, happy or influential someone may be, we all carry regrets that weigh heavily upon our shoulders like anchors. Deep inside every one of us is a dreamer that yearns for a chance to relive past experiences armed with the knowledge that we gained the first time around. Although turning back the hands of time is an impossible act, the ability to do so would be beneficial to each and every one of us. This mentality applies in all walks of life, and cinema is no different. Imagine for a moment that after John Carpenter's Halloween set the standard, the genre loosened its restraints and pushed forward to greater heights. Instead of the intoxicating pollution of minimal brained and non budgeted features that plagued cinemas after 1978; what if studios had spent time and money investing in the cycle and pushing new boundaries for its ongoing development? Despite an astoundingly negative reputation, the slasher genre, when handled correctly, can provide exemplary results. Just ask Alfred Hitchcock.In 1981, Tobe Hooper was a director with the world at his feet. Hot on the heels of his cult classic features The Texas Chainsaw Massacre and Eaten Alive, the director had been recognised by movie mogul Steven Spielberg and his name had become well respected in Hollywood circles. With the weight of a major studio behind him, Hooper decided to invest his talents in the fashionable slasher genre, which on paper promised to provide a feature that would finally rival Carpenter's classic.Hooper makes no effort to disguise Funhouse's slasher heritage and he launches his entry with a scene that references two of the genre's heavyweights. Whilst showering, our protagonist Amy is stalked via Carpenter-alike steady-cam in an opening that successfully sets the mood for the remaining runtime. The carnival has arrived in town and Amy and three of her teenage friends have decided to go along for the opening night. Despite warnings from her parents, the youngster bows to the pier pressure from her boyfriend and the youngsters arrive to be entertained by the lights and attractions on display. Ritchie has the ambitious idea to spend the night in the Funhouse, believing that the group can make-out and spend time alone without the intervention of their parents. It soon turns out to be a fateful plan, when the teens witness the brutal slaughter of one of the workers. Alone and locked in the carnival until morning, the troupe are stalked by a maniacal assassin with no chance of escape.An endless amount has been written about Tobe Hopper's full from grace. Much like a footballer that scored thirty goals in his first season and just one in the next, the downhill slope for the quality of his work was stark and unrelenting. The Spielberg collaboration on Poltergeist was supposed to launch Hooper as a Hollywood suspense maestro that would rival Hitchcock and Kubrick. Unfortunately the movie started a slope to mediocrity from which his career has never recovered. Generally movie fans look back on The Texas Chainsaw Massacre as the only truly outstanding feature in his catalogue. This record is somewhat inaccurate, because despite the inferiority of the majority of his later work, Funhouse is a decent feature that deserves further recognition. Chainsaw Massacre's strengths were its excessive use of terrifying sound, a skill that Hooper successfully repeats in this follow up. The final scene is an excellent juxtaposition of visual and audible horror and the suspense is harsh and unrelenting. Mixing bright flashes of light and the ear piercing chimes of steel cogs and chains, the director creates an atmosphere of unease that provides an outstanding backdrop to a tense showdown. The movie is helped no end by an excellent performance from the final girl, and the gore is kept minimal, which adds further credit to the director's artistic flair. We humans are obsessed with our image, and Hooper makes an intelligent social commentary as the youngsters glare in amusement at the freaks on display at the carnival. Their brash attitudes are ruthlessly avenged when they realise that they are alone with something they had previously considered to be defenceless against their mockery. Revenge is dished out coldly as the protagonist emerges psychologically warped and drained like the creatures on display at the 'freak show'. Funhouse's subtle ethical theme shows an intelligence largely unseen in the genre. Hooper's stylish direction is complemented by some crisp photography and the breathtaking editing builds impressive tension. Set pieces are skilfully conveyed and the circus freak makes an excellent bogeyman. The leads carry the feature comfortably and Hooper delivers a final that underlines his status and ability. Why Tobe Hooper never became the horror maestro that so many predicted is a mystery. Funhouse proves however that there is more to his catalogue than a Chainsaw Massacre in Texas. By far one of the best of the early eighties slashers, this entry deserves to be highly regarded. On a footnote, Funhouse was bizarrely and inaccurately banned briefly in the United Kingdom as part of the video nasty phase.

The main characters here aren't exactly likable, and I didn't really care whether they lived or died.

Is there any resonating quality or completely unique idea to be found here? No, not really. Still, it has a bit of a Scooby-Doo quality to it. Mischievous kids get stuck in a spooky funhouse and they are tip-toeing around with a masked killer on the loose. The only thing missing was Shaggy and Velma. The acting is typical for a film of this nature, but the dialogue isn't overly dreadful and the script is simple and unobtrusive for the most part. The movie doesn't try to be anything more than a romp in a creepy carnival. It also doesn't try to be any other movie. Is it a slasher film? Eh.. kinda? It doesn't feel derivative, for the most part, so you don't feel like you are watching Friday the 13th or Halloween - both made a short time before The Funhouse. It effectively uses the setting as the centerpiece and allows both the victims and the creepy carnival custodians to operate within that framework. Obviously, movies like this aren't a thing to take seriously and Hooper keeps the dialogue light and the tone remains Joker-esque in nature. This movie proves that horror movies can be both dark and fun at the same time.The Bad As the opening credits role, there is a montage of creepy automated puppets that are littered throughout the funhouse. It sets the stage for what you think is going to be a very creepy place. Sadly, the funhouse isn't really all that scary. It's a nice atmosphere for the story of the trapped kids and their would-be attackers, but the funhouse itself is a letdown. The other attractions on the carnival grounds like the (real) two-headed cow and cleft-palate cow are a more jarring sight than anything in the funhouse. The creepy puppets are just kind of in the background for most of the movie set in the funhouse and it feels like a wasted plot point. I also have to admit that the movie became much less scary (although it's not all that scary to begin with) after the deformed killer's true identity was revealed. There was something far creepier about not knowing who or what the Frankenstein-masked weirdo was and I felt that the reveal came too early in the film. The initial reveal is cool, but the end of the movie just wasn't as much fun because of this. It's like, Well, I know how this ends now. And it ends just like you think it does.The Carnies This is a Tobe Hooper directed movie and if anything, Hooper can tell the story of a deranged family better than most. The are a few moments that feel a bit like we are back in a certain grimy, backwoods Texas house, but they are not so overbearing that they become too derivative. He loves his mute, grunting, drooling derelicts now, doesn't he? And you know what? So do we. He effectively piques our interest through a slow reveal of the killer, who initially dons a Frankenstein mask and gloves. Is he a kid? Is he just an emotionally adolescent adult? Is he deformed? Well, slowly you find out and it's worse than you think. Although you have time to think about the killer under the mask, like stated above, the reveal does happen a bit too early in the film and you are left with a chase & slash movie for the unoriginal final act. I can't fail to mention though, behind every crazy killer is a crazy parent... and the apple never falls far from the tree. Gotta love sadistic carnies!

The whole thing is chaotic and hysterical (and I don't mean funny), with the four kids in constant panic as soon as they are discovered. Amy, the final girl is particularly great, and she truly shows terror and hopelessness through her acting.The inclusion of a monster made the film even more unique, and the viewer faces a moral dilemma, almost feeling bad for the deformed son and his protective, but deranged father. The creature is still human, paying for sex since he is sexually deprived, and exhibiting emotion over his father's death and when he is scolded. Another interesting aspect of the plot is that there are not only relatively few deaths, but most take place within the final half, and even final quarter of the movie. It takes it's time building up to the last half hour of utmost tension, and it is never boring.The Funhouse is exactly what a solid horror film should be, and then some.

They soon find themselves trying to stay alive as they are chased through the locked up ride by a psychotic mutated killer. While The Funhouse might not be as shocking as it was thirty years ago, it still provides some nice scares and creepy deviants that will make your skin crawl. Shout! Factory once again delivers a solid high definition edition of this cult classic for its fans to enjoy. A great picture and plenty of fun extra features outweigh the lack of any stereo audio improvement. http//contributor.yahoo.com/user/849014/eric_shirey.html "},{"Title":"Based on a Book by Dean R.

Koontz was approached to write the book based on the original story pitched to him and being young and wanting a paycheck he agreed. The book was definitely better than the movie and when the movie was released the book, by his pen name Owen West (by Mr. Koontz's admission, he was Owen out West and needed the money, thus the name Owen West) was basically yanked from the stores due to the fact that the movie was so poorly reviewed. Do yourself a favor and try the book, so much more dark, complex and much more of a back story. The father/barker story is explained, the mother/drinking is explained and the story is more emotional. If only Hollywood could learn to just film the book. I have the same feelings on all of Mr. Koontz's work translated to film. Watchers, Phantoms, Whispers...etc. The closest that a film maker has come is the film version of Intensity.

It's about a group of kids that go to a creepy carnival and find themselves trapped in the funhouse after they witness a murder. The killer happens to be a deformed carnival freak. Funhouse plays out slow (they aren't trapped in the funhouse til 50 mins into the movie), developing it's characters and foreshadowing the horror ahead. Tobe Hooper turns what would have been a standard slasher into a well-crafted and amusing horror thriller. Hooper has the ability to capture tension and the disturbing like no other director of i've seen. The deformed creature's effects were done well, there's some t&a, and the actors are all surprisingly good. It's a good 80's horror flick that gets overlooked too often. Solid rental.

The film has all the makings of your typical slasher film from the period. The film always adheres to Hooper's main horror theme s of freaks, horror houses and inevitable Teenage doom and suspense. The film seems to be in two parts the first part building up the climax. The film is interestingly filmed in most part in a carnival atmosphere. The film explores teenage issues like drug use, peer pressure, sexual curiosity, authority and even stealing. Lighting, mood, darkness of carnival people, music and camera angles and makeup help to shine Tobe s reputation as a successful horror director in the 80 s. I enjoyed the film I took it for what it is a 80 s slasher late night flick. The story was good, effects OK make up etc acting was good and plot well thought out. Not a massively popular title in the video store if you can find it, the fun house does rest in my horror collection 8 out of 10.

Against her parents advice Amy Harper, Elizabeth Berridge, goes out with her hunky boyfriend Buzz, Cooper Huckabe, to spend the night at the local carnival with her two friends Liz & Richie, Laugo Woodruff & Miles Chapin.The carnival in question has had a habit of people attending it ending up dead, with two young girls being it's latest victims. That's what makes it so challenging for Liz & Co. as well as her little and bratty brother Joey, Shawn Carson, who sneaks out of the house to go there on his own. Amy Buzz Liz & Richie have a good time looking at the freak-show who's attendant is this guy, Wayne Doba, dressed up in a Frankenstein mask and going on a number of rides. The carnival finally closes down but the four young people decide to stay there overnight and dare the fates, like in a hunted house or cemetery, which turned out to be the biggest mistake that they ever made in their young lives.Hiding up on the celling and watching what's going on with Frank, Frankenstein, Jr the two couples are at first amused with him trying to have some hot and heavy action with the carnival fortune teller, who turns tricks on the side, Madame Zena ,Sylvia Miles, that leads to the inexperienced, in having sex, Frank to embarrass himself. Frank who's not that normal to begin with goes haywire attacking Madame Zena brutally murdering her.Frank's father the owner of the freak-show, Kevin Conway, comes into clean up the mess Jr left behind and you get the impression from the talk he has with Frank that he's been doing this very often. In fact Frank Jr was responsible for the two girls who were found murdered at the carnival a year ago. The movie The Funhouse has it's scary moments but it's the spooky atmosphere and creepy acting of both Kevin Conway & Wayne Doba, as Big Daddy & Frank Jr, that really makes it work.What set off Frank Jr more then even his inability to make it with Madame Zena was that the money that he collected from the public at the freak-show was stolen by a greedy and unscrupulous Richie. Going completely nuts Frank Jr rips off his Frankenstein mask, revealing a face that not even a mother can love, with him looking like he was hit right between the eyes with a hatchet.The movie then goes into the usual slasher on the loose scenario with Frank Jr doing in just about everyone in the cast only to get himself french fried and grounded, like in a meat grinder, in the end by a plucky and at the same time hysterical Amy.What makes the movie so much more effective then the average slasher movies is that Frank Jr believe it or not does invoke sympathy from the audience since he's more a victim of birth, that he had no way of controlling, then of circumstances. It's Frank's father who's been covering up his crimes for years who should be held more responsible for them then. Pops could have had his son treated and kept away from an unsuspecting public who would sooner or later, like Amy's friends, fall victim to him.

Review There are not many films out there that can evoke the sort of sleazy, skanky, weird, freaky atmosphere of the Carnival setting. Only a hand full of films have done this pretty well (Something Wicked This Way Comes, Clownhouse, and even Killer Klowns from Outer Space) but here my friends is a perfect example of what a good Carnival movie looks and feels like! Granted, this is not Tobe Hoopers best film ever, I leave that place for Poltergeist and TCM II. But this is not a bad little movie.Funhouse is a slasher film that takes its themes and sticks to them all the way through. Not one moment passes by that you are not reminded that this is a funhouse, a carnival and you are gonna see imagery that constantly reminds you that. Even in the first scenes where we get some shots showing off Amys room filled with horror movie posters like Frankenstein and Dracula we are reminded that this is a horror film, and don't you forget it. It seems to me like Tobe Hooper was just having some good fun with this one! The story is about four teenagers going out on double dates, out of all the places they could go they decide to visit the carnival thats visiting their home town. Off they go, after a while one of them has the bright idea that it might be fun to try and sneak into the funhouse and stay in the carnival for the night. There my friends is where the fun ends for these four teenagers...and sheer terror begins.What I enjoy best about this film is how Tobe Hooper bombards us constantly with carnival imagery, you get your laughing clowns, your tents, your rides, your shows. Also i enjoy very much how the first half of the film just totally immerses us in the carnivals different rides and shows, for example we get the hokey magic show...which has an interesting finale, we get the girly shows, we get the freak show and we get the fortune teller. In each of these rides there's a feeling of foreshadowing, like something evil is lurking about, specially in the fortune teller scenes, also in the scenes with the announcer screaming you'll go in but you'll pray to get out of the funhouse!. Also the girls encounter this old lady in the bathroom, a homeless bum who warns the god is watching you! Well suffice to say that the movie just oozes with foreshadowing and an ominous feeling.In the freak show we focus on another one of the movies main themes which is freaks of nature, disfigured humans and animals. You see one of the carnies who works at the carnival is a deformed creature, son to the owner of the carnival. Tobe Hooper takes advantage of this and gives a good message on what a dysfunctional family is like, and its grizzly results, a favorite subject of his as witnessed in films like The Texas Chainsaw Massacre parts 1 and 2 or Eaten Alive.It seems Hooper enjoys portraying crazy messed up families.The film does have its flaws, because some scenes are way too slow and the pace at one point just doesn't seem to pick up. It slows down to a crawl. But once it picks up it gets very interesting, and like I mentioned before to me the most interesting parts of the movie are those in the first half, where they focus on the carnival itself as an enigmatic and evil character. After the kids get locked inside the Funhouse for the night the movie turns into your regular monster movie. You know, a bunch of people running away from the monster.Speaking of the monster, the creature here was supplied by make up man extraordinary, Rick Baker himself. Its not his best work but hey it gets the job done.Another flaw is that there's this little sub plot involving Amys little brother going on his own to the funhouse, which leads to nowhere. Why was that sub plot there? Beats me.In conclusion, its essentially a monster movie with a surreal carnival setting, with a slow pace, but with enough patience you'll get to the good stuff. Hope you'll have a good time trapped in the funhouse!

The awesome looking carnival set design creates a real sinister mood; and as a result, despite being considerably low budget, the movie has a certain edgy appeal. The atmosphere is accentuated by a fantastically thrilling score, which helps to elevate the level of suspense and enhance a few of the shocks. Notable make up effects by Rick Baker and a scenery chewing supporting performance by Sylvia Miles also contribute to the overall success of the film.

This time it's the traveling carnival complete with creepy funhouse serving as the back drop for said peril. Four teens agree to sneak inside the funhouse and spend the night. OK brilliant!! They witness a murder within the funhouse, committed by the barkers freak son. The son is the deformed product of a sexual liaison between the gruff funhouse barker and a cow?!!? Talk about the plot thickening. If you pay close attention you also learn the monster was a twin, the other child not surviving birth and thus being put on display in a formaldehyde jar and appropriately named Tad. The teens are discovered by the father and son and the terror begins. Despite being a slobbering albino freak-a-zoid (come on and wind him up) the deformed monster son is the only character you feel for. The murder he commits is out of simple mindedness and sexual frustration. It is the father who is really the more sinister villain of the pair and he generates further sympathy for the monster by being quite abusive to him, his son. This movie is fairly maligned and it shouldn't be. It's one of Tobe Hoopers better efforts. People need to realize that The Texas Chainsaw Massacre really isn't as fantastic as they try and paint it. It's a great film but peoples love for it more comes out of the(then)bold subject matter and few strong shocks than the films direction or style. I'd wager if it had come second or third in Hoopers career it'd not be so widely cherished. The Funhouse would be just as strong a film had it been as streamlined as TCM. Its main flaw to me is its runtime, padded early on with needless dialogue and a few scenes that do not add anything to the film. There's also a semi distracting sub plot that could have been ditched. A runtime of about 85 minutes instead of the 90 or so it has would of helped this movie vastly.

It's a creepy, surreal, atmospheric, stylish, scary and demented nightmare, from Tobe Hooper, who graced us with THE TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE.Four teens decide on a whim to spend the night inside the funhouse of a sleazy traveling carnival.  Once inside, they bear witness to a murder, then wind up in a cat-and-mouse fight for their lives with a crazed barker and his monstrously mutated offspring.While it was unfairly thrown into the same pile of slasher flicks such as MY BLOODY VALENTINE, THE BURNING and PROM NIGHT, THE FUNHOUSE is a far better movie.  It is deliberately paced, building tension and a sense of unease well before the kids have ventured into the nightmarish labyrinth of the funhouse.A subplot about the little brother of one of the girls following her to the carnival is equally harrowing, and his encounters outside of the carnival prove to be just as bizarre and shocking.Skewed dialog, offbeat performances, terrific music, freakish make-up effects and surreal imagery all make this one of the best horror movies of it's time.  This movie, along with CHAINSAW 1 and 2, was an obvious influence on Rob Zombie's design for HOUSE OF 1,000 CORPSES. Unfortunately, it is also a sad reminder of what Hooper was once capable of delivering.

This atmospheric and inventive horror flick in many ways reminds Texas Chainsaw, by placing ordinary people against extraordinary circumstances, a formula that would be expanded to death (no puns intended!) during the nineties with the likes of Scream and I Know What you Did Last Summer. However, those recent pictures don't even touch the grace of the old ones.The seventies and the early eighties were a profitable and interesting time when Hollywood produced the best. This leads us to The Funhouse.Taking place in a local carnival, two couples decide to spend the night inside the funhouse, making love and smoking pot. As fate would have it, they end up witnessing a crime committed by a horrible deformed and retarded boy. The father comes to his son's aid.For him it's clear that the four teenagers will tell the police about the murder if they get out of the funhouse so, as any desperate father would do to cover his son, he  chooses to hunt the boys down, one by one.Great direction from Hopper, who extracted fear and terror from the claustrophobic and dark funhouse, great acting job by Elizabeth Berridge, in the part of a weak-willed girl at first who gets to discover strength inside herself in order to survive, and by Wayne Doba, enigmatic and memorable as the deformed boy. His creepy character is capable of terrible acts,he's a murderer after all, but at the same time, the way he moves, the way he talks and the form that he is attached to his father, the only one who cares for him, make you fell the pain he hides inside. The Funhouse takes more than one hour to finally deliver the chills (building the tension that will explode later), but when it does, it's like Tobe Hopper has placed us into the Funhouse's cars and then launch them into one hell of a terrifying and scary ride!

Of course,like any worthwhile horror flick, the business going on in the forefront(the teens being stalked and killed by a grotesquely deformed freak)isn't nearly as hair-raising as the background action. The carnival itself is a monument to human depravity; the lurid freak show exhibits and scuzzy peep show tent with its tired strippers and sweaty patrons holds testament to that. Also, we're treated to the twisted relationship between barker Kevin Conway and his son, one that surely ranks up there with the most unforgettably horrid in horror movie history; you can virtually see the torment on Conway's face over having to care for this monstrosity that is also his flesh and blood. Seldom have the complex, intertwined emotions of love and revulsion been so accurately conveyed. The carny life itself is shown to be one of bleak transience and hopelessness. And that funhouse . . . climbing around in the dark among a bunch of automatons that erratically come to life would be bad enough, even without a monster following you!

The cast is great, with everything photographed in richly saturated color. The basic idea may not be very original, but the seedy carnival atmosphere elevates it considerably. Let's face it--carnivals are scary. You're there at night, surrounded by a travelling society of people from God knows where with God knows what on their minds, with screams and calliope music blasting and bizarre things popping out at you from every turn...ugh! And the monster, played by professional mime Wayne Doba, is one of the most horrifying you'll ever see. The first shot of its shrieking, drooling, hideously deformed face is like a zap with a cattle prod. Even though the material is uneven and the rocky production history sometimes shows, this Tobe Hooper shocker is very solid, effective, and worth seeing.Trivia Dean Koontz wrote a novelization under the pseudonym of Owen West. Most of the cost overruns and scheduling headaches resulted from the transportation of an entire actual carnival from the Midwest to the Ivan Tors Studios in Florida.

Nothing different than movies such as Clownhouse and other movies that deal with carnivals and haunted dwellings.  In the beginning of the movie we see the Halloween rip-off where a sisters little brother plays a trick on his older sister by stabbing her with a fake knife while she takes a shower. Only the sister lived to tell her brother off.  As well as a teenager going out with a boy that her parents don't like and going out on dates to places that are suppose to be forbidden because people have died there in the past.  Nothing original about that plot.  They have a scene about that in almost every horror movie.  And then the teenagers decide to stay the night in the haunted carnival instead of coming home.  How original is that?  How many horror movies have we seen where teenagers spend the night in places such as graveyards, houses and carnivals?  There are parts in the film that seem to fit the movie and are interesting such as when the medium tries to please this retarded beast and when things do not go his way he gets mad at the medium.  Aparently the beast is resonsible for most of the killings and when he doesn't get his way he trows a temper tantrum.  The man who played the father of the beast played a good character, I always admired him in horror movies, even though he did few of them and most of them were bad but he deserved a better part.  The killings done in this movie were almost laughable and why almost at the end of the movie did the girl stand in front of a fan and called out to her father for help when he rescued her brother from snooping in the carnival because he was following his sister? She could have called out in another location.  And why did this movie even have her brother in the carnival?  We saw very little of his part involving the carnival.  There were parts in this movie that didn't even make any sense and that was the downfall of it.  Other than that..... it was a decent little horror movie worth watching.  I'd give it a five.

At first the four are having a great time but after witnessing a murder they become the hunted by a mutant.Tobe Hooper's THE FUNHOUSE was released at a time when slashers were taking over the genre and if you look at the poster you'd think that this was going to be another but it's actually not. I think the film had a pretty negative reputation for quite sometime because people were going in expecting something that what they actually got. Technically speaking this is an extremely well-made film that manages to build up a rather nice atmosphere and it certainly has some interesting stuff going for it but there are still some flaws that keep it from being a good picture.It's interesting that Hooper would go for a scare picture even though that's not what people were really wanting in 1981. The film manages to have some very good moments thanks in large part to Hooper giving it a very interesting atmosphere. You can certainly feel the carnival atmosphere as you watch the picture and the screenplay certainly gives us a lot of character development for the four leads. Another good thing the film has going for it is the cinematography and music score. Both of them perfectly capture the shocks of what the film has to offer. For the most part the performances are also good with Elizabeth Berridge making for a good lead and we get some nice support from Sylvia Miles and William Finley.The film has its issues as I said and this includes the fact that nothing really happens until after the hour mark. I'm sure Hooper and company were wanting to build up the atmosphere as they did but I think they should have thrown in some sort of killing to keep people caught up in what's going on. Also, logically, you have to wonder about really being trapped in such a small space. This here is what really keeps the film from being better but there's still a lot to enjoy here. If you're looking for gore then you're going to be disappointed but THE FUNHOUSE is a nice little monster movie.

Most notably would be The Texas Chain Saw Massacre (1974), but that also means including this one. Although it is not as cleverly crafted nor as strangely terrifying as Mr. Hooper's first outing; it does have some redeemable qualities. The part that works the best to this picture's credit is the idea of which it focuses on. Funhouses are never what they promise, anywhere. The only intent funhouses are made for are to have fun by being creeped out. Nobody really goes there for actual fun and games.Well not according to these characters. Meet Amy (Elizabeth Berridge) a young teen girl looking to have fun with her hotshot boyfriend Buzz (Cooper Huckabee) and two other friends. Together they head out to the local carnival that's running in town and decide to be there snobbish young selves. Adding to that particular attitude is completely ignoring her parents wishes of not attending the carnival since there were some issues with it from the year before. Oh but no harm should come this time, it was all a misunderstanding - sure. Protagonist wise there isn't any particular actor that stands out. Lawrence Block's screenplay is at best average. It has interesting ideas but doesn't bother to conclude them with much closure except for its main plot.Funny thing is that Block only wrote for one other production and that was the failed and now cheap looking Captain America (1990). But perhaps even stranger is that there are various elements to the story that are similar to The Texas Chain Saw Massacre (1974). Specifically that some characters have the Southern accents, work as a family and do not have normal lives. All very similar to the cannibal family that Leatherface belonged to. The man in charge of this family is The Barker (Kevin Conway - who would play better roles later on his career). Conway is probably the best part when it came to characters but sadly he was underused. Along with Conway were other strange characters that appeared from time to time. An example of this would be of some old preacher woman. And her significance was for?As for the funhouse itself, since that is where our story takes place mostly, it works at times. Some of the vintage props look great because by today they look rather creepy. But there were also other items that felt like something today's funhouses would include too. The best particular scene would be the chase in the basement. That was creepier than the actual funhouse. Andrew Laszlo's cinematography, the guy behind First Blood (1982) got some nice shots of the carnival but once inside the funhouse, nothing was really interesting. John Beal's music was alright occasionally. He did have some creepy tunes but other than that it wasn't very memorable. It's not unwatchable but there are better things to see unless carnivals are truly unsettling to you.The setting can't fail at being creepy because what funhouse isn't? What makes it average though is its non-engaging characters and flimsy writing.

They soon find themselves trapped by the carnie and his father who will kill anyone to protect his monster like child.I remember I was really eager to see this movie a couple of years ago, as I found out that this were directed by Tobe Hooper who directed the terrifying Texas Chainsaw Massacre. But on my first viewing I found this movie really rather average and quite disappointing. Then not long after I discovered that there was a book based on this movie, so I set out to find it and read it, and to be honest I really enjoyed the book, even more so than the movie itself, as it delved more into the characters and put in a twist that doesn't even feature in the movie itself, well anyway the books are always better than the films anyway.But compared to some of Tobe Hoopers other movies he's done over the years this is actually a lot better than nearly all of them. The funhouse itself filled with animatronics clowns and creatures. This part gives off an undeniably menacing vibe and gets the movie off to a decent start. And when the teens are found out by the killers is definitely effect as they are chased around the funhouse. This movie also has a classic feel to it and parodies at the beginning are quite and sets the tone for this movie.But one of the disappointing aspects of this movie are the deaths are rather lack lustre and there's almost no blood which is quite odd the fact that this is supposed to be a slasher movie, instead this movie relay's on old school scares and sheer terror which does work. The special effects are also really good as well, like when the monster/man child takes off his mask and shows his real face, which was horrifying but awesome. But another disappointing aspect is that none of the teen characters were likable or sympathetic enough to root for, but they were decently well acted though.All in all The Funhouse a bit hit and miss for me, it does have a fun creepy setting, but tends to go off pace.

But what the hell, what is it all about, why was it on the 'video nasties' list. We all know that the list of 'video nasties' was a list with mostly boring flicks that had nothing special to offer. But they were on the list because when the boom of VHS happened in the UK the covers were mostly nasty or gory or had sexual pictures. So the list was one big joke. I wont go further into the story but The Funhouse is another perfect example of why it was put on the list. The name Tobe Hooper did ring a bell, he was the director of The Texas Chainsaw Massacre (1974). One that was banned for more than 20 years in the UK but never was put on the nasties list but still, Tobe was a bad man back then. If you watch The Funhouse then you will see that it really is a slow starter. It takes almost more than half this flick before things really go wrong with the children attending the funhouse. But what a great opening sequence this flick had, an ode to old school horrors. The first thing I was surprised of was the juggs shown by 19 year old Elizabeth Berridge. From there on it's classic galore. We see someone picking up a mask just like in Halloween, even the way it was shot reminded me of Halloween (1978), then we see the shower scene, did that ring a bell, yep, Psycho (1960). All that terror is going on while the parents are watching Bride Of Frankenstein (1935) on television. But it goes further. Rick Barker (special effects) even made a mask that looked like the monster in Frankenstein, by which I mean the Universal classic. So far so good but as I said, from there it all falls a bit down. It is even so that I haven't seen any red stuff to mention let's even say gore. The whole flick is created on the atmosphere of the carnival and especially the funhouse. It isn't a slasher but still it's a feed towards the killer. For a Tobe Hooper flick it's well directed and still even as you get through the first half you want to know what will happen with the children. For the time it was made, the heydays of the slashers it was low on everything but the acting saved the flick and it became collectible due the 'video nasties' list.Elisabeth went further to perform in Amadeus two years later and is still busy at this writing. Shawn Carson, (Joey Harper) as a kid went further to another classic Something Wicked This Way Comes (1983) but it was also his last flick. Another name that made it was Cooper Huckabee (Buzz Dawson) who is seen in True Blood as Joe Lee Mickens and is at the moment busy making an exploitation with Quentin Tarantino, the notorious Django Unchained. Others went further uncredited in other horrors like Jeepers Creepers II (Largo Woodruff) and some did went further as a B-actor in major flicks like Kevin Conway.So much is said about The Funhouse but for people who do want the full 'video nasties' list in their collection pick it up, for others who like for example the original House Of Wax (1953) it's also a recommendation.

It's certainly more creative and better made than the vast majority of slasher movies. Still, although it's better than The Mangler, it's light-years away from his tour de force, The Texas Chainsaw Massacre. Although it has its share of good, scary moments, it's an overall mediocre film. As a diversion for a rainy afternoon, it works, but no one will rank it among the horror greats anytime soon. It takes forever to get going--nearly the entire first half in fact--as the young principles are enjoying a traveling carnival's many delights and freakshow shocks. All well and good, but this is a horror movie. Shouldn't something scary be happening sooner or later. Well, it finally does, as they all sneak in the funhouse to spend the night--an action they will all soon regret, as the carnival's dark secret is revealed.To his credit, Hooper successfully establishes a creepy atmosphere that is strangely appropriate to the setting. Take a look at the way the opening credits are designed, with these seemingly ordinary, yet sinister circus dummies. It's an open secret that most of us have a part of ourselves that mistrust clowns. After all, why would any sane person choose to dress in such garish colors and makeup? The lighting uses a palette of reds, grays, and greens to create a setting that exists in its own little twilight world, not unlike the later Nightmare on Elm Street films. Makeup artist Rick Baker has crafted a fairly convincing monster lurking within, menacing yet oddly sympathetic. Horror buffs will dig the opening spoof of Halloween and Psycho. The ending is a good piece of suspense work.Still, the film's many flaws work against its virtues. TCM might have been a bit slow to start, but in that case, Hooper had done a much better job establishing an uneasy mood to set us up for the more outright scares. Likewise, he tries to do so in this case, but this time, it doesn't quite work. Plus, there's a pointless subplot about the heroine's younger brother, who sneaks out of the house at night to head for the carnival. I was under the impression that this material was added solely to pad out the running time. The character's presence never makes any difference in the resolution of the story, so these scenes are entirely superficial. Finally, the Richie character is a bit annoying, especially since his actions alert the villain to their presence. I was hoping to like The Funhouse. It has a good central concept, a creepy atmosphere, and a few good scares. Kevin Conway does a credible job as the deranged carnival guy, and newcomer Elizabeth Berridge is a strong lead heroine.

Soon they are noticed, and trying to find their way out the locked up funhouse.Even though it somewhat plays out like a roller coaster ride with its up and downs amongst its pacing and jolts. Hooper's slasher item is solid and stylishly done, if typical stalk 'n' slash. Coming off such films like The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Eaten Alive and the TV feature Salem's Lot, Hooper was on a roll and The Funhouse was another capable effort. What I really loved about this one was the use of the authentic carnival setting. The off-kilter atmosphere was right on the mark, with a moody and vivid presentation cooked up and lurking within was a dark underbelly. Production designer Morton Rabinowitz did an ace job. Hooper executes the slow burn suspense nicely, and creates a bizarre and creepy ambiance from his well-placed visuals and takes advantage of the novel backdrop. Really Hooper keeps it restraint, and lets the smoothly framed and provocative camera-work of Andrew Laszlo and elaborately creepy music score by John Beal form the film's lasting effect. Writer Larry Block's story goes about things in a rather simple and old-fashioned manner, where the script shows some attention to the characters and settings. There's a neat little Halloween crossed Psycho homage to open up with too. Sure it's slow to kick off with, and the deaths are bloodless and mostly off-screen, but the film reeks with an airy and chilling vibe that's just hard to shake and the location seems to get far more tighter and claustrophobic further along it goes. Rick Baker's make-up effects are very memorable, and will have you drooling. The performances are above average, and they set up some amusing personalities.

It has all the perfect ingredients freaks, sleazy carnies, creepy fun houses...The answer, unfortunately for viewers of The Funhouse, is Tobe Hooper.The film, which follows a group of dim-witted teenagers trapped in a fun house, suffers from bad writing, poor character development, and general unbelievability. For starters, the film goes nowhere for the first forty-five to fifty minutes. If this time had been used for character development, it wouldn't be so bad, but instead it just follows the characters as they meander through the carnival.Furthermore, when things finally get going, none of the characters are worth caring about. Their behavior is too stupid for the viewer to be invested in them, particularly when they just stand around when they should be running.This issue is particularly striking in the case of the heroine. She does little if anything to protect herself. For the viewer to invest themselves in a protagonist, whether it be Jamie Lee Curtis in Halloween or Heather Langenkamp in A Nightmare on Elm Street, they have to make some effort to defend themselves, or at least act independently. Our heroine just stands around screaming.The only thing saving this film from a one star rating is its at times inspired use of atmosphere. The carnival comes across as genuinely sleazy, with shifty carnies and the occasional mad person walking about. Furthermore, the ending is truly eerie.

The vast majority of the reviewers of this film seem to have fond memories of being scared by it when they were younger. Never having seen it before might explain why I found the film so boring and unoriginal. The opening scene, described by many as a homage to Halloween and Psycho, felt more like a ripoff to me; plus I felt bad for poor Elizabeth Berridge (better known as Mozart's wife in Amadeus) who had to bare her breasts within the first 4 minutes of the film, for no other reason than to fulfill the gratuitous boob shot that was required of so many films in this genre. The film itself takes much too long to get going...nothing happens (and I mean NOTHING) within the first hour. By the time deaths finally began to occur I really didn't care. The look of the film is great, the score is interesting (without borrowing a lot from other films), and the killer is interesting as well, but I just couldn't get past one simple fact for a travelling carnival, the funhouse itself is huge, consists of multiple floors and most obviously could never be packed up an d moved to a neighbouring town by the one man who runs it. It looks great Tobe, but a basement on a carnival ride? Enter at your own risk.

His debut film, Texas CHAINSAW, might be the greatest horror film in modern times, a benchmark in which to compare all horror movies since. So, why is it that he's never really been able to come close to the majesty of that movie? Yes, you can point to POLTERGEIST, but many in filmdom would argue that movie is more Spielberg than Hooper.I would put this movie in a similar category with EATEN ALIVE, his previous film, a movie which I seem to enjoy far more than most. Both movies carry a similar problem, though. They are gorgeously filmed, stylishly lit, artistic slashers with wooden characters, dull plots and poor pacing. Part of that blame lies in the screenwriters, to be sure, but it's as if Hooper spent far too much time worrying about how to shoot his films and not enough wondering if it was a worthwhile film to make in the first place.The movie starts off with an homage to HALLOWEEN, introducing us to the main heroine and her kid brother who will be pivotal to the plot. We could, also, argue here that there is a fine line between paying homage and ripping off. Our final girl has a typical a*hole boyfriend who is taking her to a carnival against her father's wishes, with two stereotypical teens in tow. From here, the movie spends a little bit too much time with the teens exploring the carnival. It badly cries out for something similar to the Hitchhiker scene in TCM to establish a bit of tension that will carry the plot through this portion, something that portends the doom to follow, but it's essentially nothing more than 4 generic teens walking around a carnival. When I say generic, I mean it. There is no personality to here. Nothing to like or dislike. They exist only to die later. I do think Kevin Conway's multiple appearance as a carny barker are good here and help to set somewhat of a tone. There's something inherently creepy, to me, about that poor audio, cheap microphone sound that's used well. The fun starts when the teens decide to spend the evening in the funhouse. This is where Hooper really shines. He uses the spooky qualities of the old school carnival shocks to maximum effect, combined with his always excellent sense of lighting to create a genuinely unsettling funhouse atmosphere.The teens then witness something that will spell out their inevitable doom and our creature is unmasked in a reveal reminiscent of Chaney's PHANTOM OF THE OPERA. The monster makeup is excellent and provides a unique slasher villain. From here, though, the movie just never goes anywhere you want it to go. Hooper sets up these amazing sets and excellent shots and you want so much for him to use this setting to the same max effect that he was able to use the old farmhouse in TCM, but it never gets there. The killings become paint by the numbers, formulaic slasher deaths, all leading up to the inevitability that our final girl will escape and the monster will meet its' demise.It's better than the majority of generic slashers that came out in the wake of HALLOWEEN and Friday THE 13th, but can't quite elevate itself to classic level.

The acting is solid and the dialogue is about as realistic as you can expect in one of these films.

After witnessing a murder, they find themselves trapped in a funhouse with a hideously disfigured and dangerous humanoid fiend (a remarkably expressive pantomime performance by Wayne Doba). Director Tobe Hooper vividly captures the creepy seaminess of the lurid carnival setting, builds plenty of tension and eerie atmosphere, adds a few nice touches of pitch-black humor, pays affectionate homage to various fright films of yore (for example, the monster wears a rubber Frankenstein mask to cover his grotesquely malformed face), and stages the shocks with real skill and flair. John Beal's smart script neatly explores the themes of family, illusion, perception, voyeurism, and invasion of privacy while cleverly subverting basic genre conventions The kids aren't completely sympathetic because they are responsible for the predicament they find themselves in due to the fact that they stayed in the carnival after it closed, the monster comes across as both tragic and pitiable, and the creature's brutish and domineering father (superbly played by Kevin Conway) emerges as the true hateful villain of the piece. The four young leads do commendable work Foxy buxom brunette Elizabeth Berridge makes for a fetching and appealing damsel in distress as virginal innocent Amy, Cooper Huckabee contributes a likable turn as the decent and handsome Buzz, while both Miles Chapin as the nerdy Richie and Largo Woodruff as teasing trollop Liz are solid in their roles. Popping up in nifty secondary parts are Sylvia Miles as withered old hag fortune teller Madame Zena, Herb Robbins as the friendly carny owner, and William Finley as pathetic drunken magician Marco the Magnificent. Andrew Laszlo's sharp cinematography gives the picture a strikingly stylized garish look. John Beal's robustly ominous score does the spirited spine-tingling trick. A worthy scarefest.

Two couples decide to spend the night in a seedy carnival fun house (which has a reputation for being the site of the murders of two girls in another town, who's maniac was never caught), while there, they witness the murder of a psychic that they had visited early in the night, while the carnival was open, at the hands of a cleft-headed sideshow freak who hides his deformity behind a Frankenstien mask. On the run, the kids find that they can't escape & then get picked off one by one by the crazed maniac. I had a lot of fun with THE FUNHOUSE (no pun intended) it was quiet a treat to view the film again after having not seen it in many a year & best of all, despite when it was made, the film still holds up very well today & makes for a fun popcorn horror flick. The acting works reasonably well & director Tobe Hooper is able to deliver one of his best directorial efforts in his career. Particularly impressive is how he is able to deliver a gorgeous widescreen colour camera work. You could tell that he had a ball helping put together THE FUNHOUSE, which is probably best described as the equivalent of a ride on a ghost train. The film opens strongly as we see through the eyes of a masked prowler (a nod to HALLOWEEN) entering a girls bedroom to stab her while she takes her clothes off to get in the shower (In a terrific nod to PSYCHO). Universal also doesn't ignore their past horror heritage either, as the lead heroines younger brothers room is filled with classic posters & masks of all the Universal classic movie monsters like the WOLFMAN, Dracula & FRANKENSTIEN & THE BRIDE OF FRANKENSTIEN is seen playing on the TV set the parents are watching, before the heroine leaves for the carnival & all of this is just in the first five minutes of the film!. Hooper also really milks the atmosphere for all it's worth, especially in the carnival attraction & fun house itself, with it's reasonably eerie look, with creepy looking dummies & mechanical laughing puppets & statues that adorn the fun house itself, while the carnival itself is decked out with various weirdos of all kinds, to creepy looking old bag ladies, crazed gun toting, possibly homicidal hicks, creepy carnival barkers (three of which are played quiet wonderfully by COLIN FINLAY), weird magicians who's closing act is murdering a girl on stage, with a poker through the heart while trapped in a casket, only for it to turn out to be a fake (a nod to Universal's Dracula, with us even receiving a history lesson on the man the famous vampire was based on), dirty odd ball bums, odd ball fortune tellers, a creepy old man peeking in on naked girls, weird monstrosities in jars & deformed animals in a freak show, in fact minus the kids & parents & the girls younger brother, no one seems to be completely sane & all of this lends to a creepy unsettling feel. The suspense & tension is great, as is the eerie carnival atmosphere & the great, eerie & haunting carnivelsque score by JOHN BEAL which next to the cool soundtrack that throws some eerie sounds from all areas of the screen, makes this one of the best horror soundtracks ever to grace a horror picture. The films kills are relatively bloodless (usually electrocutions & stranglings, not to mention some blood on the creatures claws, hangings & a few bloodless impaling) however & are few & far between, not to mention it takes it's time getting going, so hardcore horror buffs looking for some bloody action will no doubt be disappointed by this fact. But it's never boring & always has something going on to keep you interested in its plot, until the action kicks in. The film only falters when it shows the creature make-up up close, when it really should have been keep half hidden in the shadows, since you can clearly see most of the material used to make the freak make-up is rubber. Highly recommended horror buffs, this FUNHOUSE is definitely terrifying & worth the ticket price if you want to see a really good horror film that sadly doesn't seemingly get made anymore.**** stars "},{"Title":"Nothing special.

Directed by Tobe Hooper of Texas Chain Saw Massacre (1974) fame, whilst that film was not on the nasties list, it certainly impacted in the hearts and minds of any respectable censor. This entry did not spend much time in banned status, as it was released uncut in 1987, and was later reinstated with a 15 certificate in the early part of the noughties. It is very difficult to see why (outside of my own speculation of director association) this film was even considered by the DPP, as it has not one element of horror or gore, or any kind of overtly nasty elements.The narrative involves itself with four teenagers, Amy (Elizzabeth Berridge), Buzz (Cooper Huckabee), Liz (Largo Woodruff) and Richie (Miles Chapin), are on double dates to a local traveling carnival. They decide to stay the night in the funhouse. There they witness the murder of the carnivals fortune teller, by the deformed, retarded son of the owner. After Richie steals some money from the kitty, their presence is signaled. So proceeds a standard stalk-and-slash style climax. Released at a time when there was practically a new slasher film released each week, The Funhouse shares more narrative ideas with The Texas Chain Saw Massacre, than the majority of the slasher films, that were using Halloween (1978) as their template. This film is stylistically similar to Halloween, not using the more gritty, haphazardness of Chain Saw, it's cinematography almost replicating that Carpenter widescreen classiness. But the carnie family are closer to those Texans (replete with it's own Leatherface), than the lone figure so prevalent between 1978 and 1984. The film is pretty low on scares, but does pass by it's 90 minutes relatively quickly. This is not to say it's a terrible film. It certainly is better than much of the sub-genres output. But it's still a shame that Hooper was never able to recapture the excellence of his first feature. Something he has still yet to top.www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com "},{"Title":"She's stoned.

Far better to keep people thinking something's going to happen than to deliver it all the time - so long as you can maintain the suspense and provide a payoff at the end. I think Funhouse manages to do this, building up the creepy atmosphere of the funfair for two thirds of the film before things really kick into high gear. The director doesn't cynically assume the audience needs cheap thrills every few minutes to keep their attention. Having said that, a few more chills and thrills than we did get wouldn't have gone astray, which is probably the main reason the film gets a low IMDb rating. Director Tobe Hooper would go onto Poltergeist after this, which made a much bigger effort to keep you on the edge of your seat, even though it too took the time to build up the story.Even so, what we get here is quite entertaining, the acting is competent enough (why haven't we seen more of Elizabeth Berridge?), the lighting is used to good effect, and the special effects are pretty good for the period.

As it stands, Dean Koontz's novelization of the screenplay has a far cooler opening than the actual film itself complete with a killer baby in a crib that would have predated Frank Henenlotter's Basketcase by a full year.

One of it's most impressive feats is that it gives us a nice carnival atmosphere with some interesting sights. The setting is the best thing about this, as great pains is taken to turn the early part into setup, and this does create a great atmosphere for later on in the film. By taking a trip through the garish freak-show, which includes on exhibit a two-headed cow and a deformed, bottled fetus, the mechanized fun-house creatures, the deformed inbred monster, the creepy surreal barkers and more, the groundwork is laid for some real fun. The attention to detail he gives the carnival at the beginning is amazing, even the stuff that is going on in the background. This is obviously thrilled by the colors, textures and shadows of the carnival and capably turns the place into a menacing and alien environment. Even the carnival workers themselves are weird and seedy. The fun-house itself is a great set. There are loads of evil-looking mannequins brandishing knives and spinning around on the spot. It's all very colorful and really adds to the freakiness factor of the setting and provides an ideal place for a series of stalk 'n' slash moments with it's dimly lit corridors, noises whirring in the background and dummies popping out to scare people. The film's main positive point, though, is the extremely great showdown at the end. There's rarely been a better one in the annals of the slasher genre, starting inside a hall of mirrors and wandering through the back-rooms, down into the bowels of carnival, finally ending up in the machinery room. It's quite impressive and really stands out in the field. The stalking inside the fun-house generates some great tension as well, including a couple crashing through doors and some real surprise pop-ups from the other carnival attractions. The film even includes a few stand-out scenes, where the killer takes off a mask and reveals a real inhuman visage, and a particularly harrowing image where the heroine is calling to her parents through a large, wildly-spinning exhaust fan, but they cannot hear her because she is too far away. With a surprisingly sleazy way of getting events started, this one has a lot to like and becomes a really underrated slasher.The Bad News There really isn't a whole lot wrong with this one. One of it's problems is the slow pace in the beginning. By using the opening as the setup for the walk-through of the carnival, this here takes a large amount of time to get started. There's around an hour of material before the killer is even getting started, and while it builds up atmosphere, this really could've been trimmed down a tad and replace most of the running around.. The sub plot involving Amy's Brother is one of those big reasons, also holds things up and ultimately never comes to anything, despite the build up it is given. It's quite hard to believe that the outcome is really all that deserving, and it in itself is just an awful plot-line that holds up even more time. The film's other big problem is the lack of gore in the kills. For such takes as an ax in the head, a sword in the back, a stabbing and being crushed by hydraulic equipment has so little gore in the film, and it really could've used more. Otherwise, this one here was quite nicely done.The Final Verdict With only a few nagging problems, this really is a quite underrated slasher film with a lot to like about it. It's creepy, frightening and full of intense action, leaving it a film full of entertainment and a full recommendation for the slasher fans in the crowd.Rated R Violence, Graphic Language, Nudity and mild drug use "},{"Title":"Funhouse ain't no fun, if only for Chapin","Date":"16 May 2014","Score":"0 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Horror","Review":" I hate a lot nothing happeningness in movies, especially horror films, with not much gore, etc. Sadly Funhouse is one of those movies.

One saving grace of the film, where I thought the small dark haired girl, seen in that other movie, The Beach Girls, was cute, was talented actor, Miles Chapin (The Funny Farm, Get Crazy), the joker of the foursome, who's spirited performance is one of the only reasons to see this. Our foursome, happy and free, decide to stay up in the Funhouse, only they've invaded someone's territory, for the amusement park is owned by a family of weirdos, one sour tarot car reader, who doesn't take kindly to ridicule, or, people interrupting her sessions, like from Chapin's background smirks, that has him trying to suppress his laughter. Honestly Chapin's the best thing about this film, and the tarot card's reader doesn't give them the most warmest of invitations to come back. Personally I'm with her on that one.

Hooper fails utterly to build any suspense whatsoever, and instead opts for making it seem like a lengthy ordeal...and what a lengthy ordeal it is. The film clocks in at just over an hour and a half, but it seems like trying to get through Berlin Alexanderplatz; it's a dull slog in which nothing interesting happens, and even when the monster is unveiled, it's neither shocking nor even mildly engaging.That's the most inexcusable aspect of The Funhouse it's boring and at no point does the direction build any tension. It's not scary. It's not funny. It's not even exciting. It seems almost pretentious in its self-indulgence, but there's absolutely no artistic statement to it, possibly because there's also no art to it. This is as imaginative as paint-by-numbers, and about as unexceptional. If you ever wondered why you haven't heard of The Funhouse, try to sit through it. Unless you're the type of person who really and truly enjoys watching obnoxious people spend an utterly unexceptional evening at a carnival, you won't get much out of this.

The latter amounts to an all-too-obvious homage to both HALLOWEEN (1978) and PSYCHO (1960), and the scene is followed by one more &#150; though it seems highly unlikely to me that the average American family of 1981 would gather in the living-room to watch something like BRIDE OF FRANKENSTEIN (1935) playing on TV&#133; Anyway, the carnival section delivers the goods in both the atmosphere and chills stakes &#150; from animal freak shows to fortune-telling and culminating in a 'House Of Horror'-type ride; the youngsters then commit the typical foolishness associated with slashers by opting to stay behind for the night to make out in The Funhouse &#150; even though this particular carnival troupe (including an underused but effective William Finley as a 'gruesome' magician) had been connected with a murder a couple of years back! Sure enough, they soon witness the slaying of the ageing fortune-teller (Sylvia Miles) they had themselves made fun of by a kid in a Frankenstein costume (the usher to The Funhouse itself) &#150; the result of his feeling slighted when his sexual encounter with the undiscriminating Miles was prematurely terminated! When the teens' presence is detected, the alcoholic Funhouse barker (Kevin Conway) puts the monster boy (who's his own disfigured and uncontrollable offspring and not unlike the Leatherface of Hooper's earlier classic THE Texas CHAIN SAW MASSACRE 1974) on the teenagers' trail; while he naturally wants to protect his son as well as the image of the carnival, Conway's also intent on retrieving the money that was stolen from his coffers by one of our imprudent and, subsequently, ill-fated heroes. For my money, the make-up job done by expert-in-the-field Rick Baker for the monster/killer is one of the most effectively hideous ever devised; the scenes of violence, then, combine Hooper's trademark intensity with a fair smattering of the gore demanded by the subgenre &#150; unsurprisingly, the heroine is the only one to make it out alive&#133;though she's anything but unscathed by the experience.

With Tobe Hooper directing, a mutant albino daddy's been keepin' locked in the basement, and a healthy 1981 in the copyright position, I could hardly wait to pop it in. I was actually surprised I had missed it when it was released.Man, was I disappointed - What a weak movie! Almost every scene is predictable and for some ridiculous reason, Tobe chooses to broadcast each upcoming death and then let the scene linger far, far too long.

The Funhouse represents another lacklustre effort for Hooper, and if it wasn't for the fact that the DPP made a blunder in 1984 when they confused this film with the alternate title for 'The Last House on Dead-End Street', I very much doubt that it would have been remembered. It does seem like Hooper wanted this film to be considered 'nasty', however, as he implements scenes that see things such as a hideously deformed man paying for sex; but the feel of the film is so childish that it never really achieves this aim. The plot follows four teenagers that decide to go to the local funfair. After taking in the sights, one of them suggests that they stay in the funfair overnight; and this leads to view the carnival's seedy underbelly, and they come a cropper when they find themselves at the mercy of a murderous employee.The film starts out very slowly, as Hooper shows all aspects of the fair. I understand the importance of creating the right atmosphere for the film; but did we really need to see the deformed cow show, the ghost train, the fortune teller, a 'magician' and a whole load of other stuff? As if this wasn't bad enough, once the film does get going properly, it simply descends into the same slasher tedium that was overly popular back in the eighties. The killer is hideously deformed, and the best scene in the movie sees him remove a Halloween mask, only to reveal a face that is actually worse than the mask! However, the make-up effects look cheesy, and seem like an obvious attempt to make the killer memorable...but since it's hardly original, it doesn't really work. It also takes far too long for it to appear that any of the cast are actually in any real danger, and while the ending and build-up to it actually aren't bad, it's brought down by the lack of tension. The cast aren't very memorable, with only the one that dies first standing out and even though this film will always have viewers for its undeserved Video Nasty status, it really isn't very good.

Completely out of nowhere total knuckle head Richie suggests that they spend the entire night in the carnivals funhouse, don't ask why. Amy's little brat of a brother Joey (Shawn Carson) visits the carnival on his own, strangely he doesn't interact with anyone else at the carnival and has no significance whatsoever to the overall story, he just generally walks around aimlessly to waste time. Once in the funhouse they hide and get ready for a long night. Then under neath them a light turns on, they appear to be above another room. The friends look on as Madame Zena the fortune teller and the funhouse's attendant (Wayne Doba) who wears a Frankenstein mask enter the room below them. The attendant gives Zena $100 in exchange for her to masturbate him. After he can't get an erection and Zena refuses to give him his money back he strangles her. The friends try and leave the funhouse but all the doors are locked and chained up, they are trapped. They decide to head back to their hiding place, again they look into the room below. The funhouse's Barker (Kevin Conway) who happens to be the attendants dad is also there now. The attendant takes his Frankenstein mask off and reveals that he is a mutant freak. Richie drops his lighter and they are discovered. From then on the friends must survive as they are hunted down one by one.Directed by Tobe Hooper, and according to the IMDb he turned down Steven Spielberg's offer to direct E.T. (1982) because of this film, bad move Tobe, bad move. This adds nothing new to the horror or slasher genre. It's predictable, dull, boring, over talkative and uninteresting. The opening sequence rips off both Halloween (1978) and Psycho (1960) or if you prefer pays homage to them, either way it gave me the feeling that there wasn't going to be an original idea in the whole film, and by the end I thought I was proved right. There's just about next to no gore or violence and an extremely low body count, no one is killed until over half way through the film. The monster itself, created by Rick Baker, is revealed in a very low key fashion. It's obviously just a mask that has no movement at all, the eyes, nose and forehead are static while occasionally it's mouth will open and close a little bit. Personally I thought he looked creepier with the Frankenstein mask on. There is brief nudity at the start as Amy takes a shower. The script by Larry Block is strictly by the numbers, I could easily tell who was going to survive, and that she would stop screaming become tough and resourceful and kill the bad guy at the end. Something else to take into consideration is that this was made after or about the same time as most other early eighties slashers including Halloween, Friday the 13th (1980), the Burning (1981), the Prowler (1981), Hell Night (1981), Just Before Dawn (1981), My Bloody Valentine (1981) and Night School (1981) and I would stick Funhouse right at the bottom of that list. The main problem I had with it is that it's just so devoid of any action, it takes 40 odd minutes for Richie to even suggest they spend the night in the funhouse, and it's one of those film where I got the feeling not much really happened between the start and finish. The only thing the film has going for it is the fact that it's technically very well made and has a polished look about it, otherwise this is a total waste of time. Recommended to insomniacs only.

Even though he makes good use of the creepy carnival settings, the violence and the killings are uninspired. The main characters are annoying ( except for the young Elizabeth Berridge. She's a real sweetie ) and the villains are laughable and they suffer from the typical clichés.---------SPOILERS-------- The plot is classic. Two young couples decide to spend the night in The Funhouse...a spooky attraction on the local carnival. The owners of this funhouse turn out to be real circus-freaks and they youngsters witness a murder. From that moment on, they become the prey of the vicious owners. No surprises or creative aspects in the plot so far but that isn't really necessary in a slasher. All I expect is a bit of nasty gore and innovative killings...and we don't even get that. The highlights of this movie are the puppets and little creatures who're hanging in the funhouse. The make creepy noises and build up the tension pretty well. But when the actual characters have to take over this job, the movie becomes a boring, mediocre product.A real shame about the atmospheric locations and especially a waste of the young talent of Elizabeth Berridge. Still, it belongs to the better films of Tobe Hooper. If you analyse his entire career, you can easily come to the conclusion that he's a very overrated director. True, he deserves all the praise he can get for Texas Chainsaw Massacre but it is his only REALLY good movie. Horror Hotel and Salem's Lot are decent efforts ( and perhaps also the Funhouse belongs to the decent ones ) but Poltergeist and especially his more recent work is laughable.  The Funhouse is worth one watch for the cool puppets and impressive carnival decors...as a horror movie, it can easily be skipped. "}]
