Yes, Marlon and George were perfect for their respective roles. Brando playing the aging corporate bad guy who knows the score, and Scott an over the hill cop who gets his teeth into something he just can't seem to let go of. Both, to me, fit their respective characters well. The nature of the plot, although kept vague was necessary for the internal intrigue to build. Still, many did not like this forced need to contemplate the many aspects of this film as it was being seen. Yet, I wonder if those who did not enjoy this movie as I did might not find it more interesting if viewed today with gas heading toward $4 and then maybe $5 a gallon? Does everyone need to have everything shown to them in a movie or am I just one of the few who's head doesn't hurt when I use it for what it was designed to do?

For some reason, I actually liked this film--maybe I have bad taste, but I found it to be a very pleasant surprise! Maybe some of my positive regard for this is because I like George C. Scott so much and because I like paranoid and depressing movies (and this one has all these elements). In fact, I am guessing that the depressing nature of the film is much of the reason why others dislike it (there are a lot of murders in the movie). But I liked it for the odd plot--about the evil oil producers trying to suppress a secret for a cheaper fuel through murders and payoffs. But, if you do decide to watch this film, please try to remember that it's only a film. This is not a piece of non-fiction!UPDATE--8/08. I re-watched this film (something I rarely do) and was surprised how dull I found it a second time. While I still liked the paranoid plot involving a worldwide oil conspiracy, this time I noticed that the film was a bit too talky and the plot a bit too convoluted. Plus, and I know Brando fans will hate me for saying this, but his acting seemed a tad over-done. Still, it's a decent film even if I did knock my original score from 8 to 6.

Most in this country would love to be left to their own devices by marketing/consuming fuel based on American coal derivatives like those delineated in the Genesis formula instead of depending upon foreign petroleum. The parallels outlined here are close to today's, especially the popular theories these days that big oil is suppressing valid fuel alternative projects that would undercut their energy dominance, hence, their financial status.Unlke some other reviewers, I thought the film moved along at a nicely orchestrated pace, making it, perhaps, a more analytical movie than a Hollywood flash-and-dash melodrama. The film follows a logical progression of events that lets the viewer absorb the contents in easy to swallow doses, that is, as long as he/she pays attention to the plot development.I was impressed by mostly all the actors, especially Marthe Keller, who acquitted herself very well in her portrayal by staying well within her character and by her impeccable timing and fluid delivery. Mr. Brando's rather short stint in the film was punctuated by terse, cynical and penetrating dialog, playing the enterprising villain who continually cuts to the chase with large doses of street-wise metaphors. George C., as usual, is a no-nonsense good cop who only wants to see justice prevail, regardless of who gets burnt. Yet inside him, demons from the past lurk and can't help but surface from time to time you can see it in the non-verbal communication that Mr. Scott so characteristically exudes.Thanks to TCM for showing these kinds of films that are usually omitted on other movie channels.

Everything revolving around the basic premise of this film, the situations, the dialogue, the revelation of world economic truths, the actual history behind the modern-day, post-war plot line, the intrigue, and the superb conflict-acting by both George C. Scott and Marlon Brando made this cinematic foray into a little-known history of my former business all the more believable---and here's why During the war, the Third Reich, and out of sheer necessity from its failed campaigns in both North Africa and the Caucasus Mountains, actually DID develop synthetic petroleum extracted from coal (called coal hydrogenation, or Kohleveredelung) in the Ruhr Basin for everything from lubricants to fuels to other synthetic by-products. The principal synthetic refineries at Merseburg, Magdeburg, and Gelsenkirchen, Germany, and Ploesti, Romania (11 facilities all-told), and a number of related others, were raided by both the US Army Air Forces and RAF Bomber Command as maximum-effort targets to be destroyed at all costs. The Wehrmacht had it and we didn't and we wanted it, and after the war, we got it and kept it, and kept it a secret, so the movie really is a loose form of cinéma vérité. This was more than alluded to in George C. Scott's final scene of excoriation of Marlon Brando's character, which was eerily similar to Ned Beatty's soliloquy and not-dissimilar treatment of Peter Finch in the earlier 1976 feature film, Network, however, much shorter.The one tag line that brought it all into focus by Scott at the end was, You're not in the oil business; you're in the oil SHORTAGE business! Although panned by a number of reviewers (including The New York Times, amongst others) for everything from goofs (all movies have them), acting, and art direction, I gave it five stars, simply for the combination of a familiar hypothesis and idea, and with the raw dynamic acting talent of those two splendid late giants of the film industry, Scott and Brando.To someone as me who cut his teeth in the oil business out of college, and whose father actually bombed some of these plants from a B-17 during the war, it was once again mesmerizing to see this both rumored and storied mystery come to life.

It has a solid cast, a solid script, solid production values &#150; everything, in fact, but a reason to watch it. It's one of those lethargic thrillers where cardboard characters constantly talk to each other about things that happened offscreen and which the film would have been far better showing us as George C.

The teaming of Oscar's two most famous refusniks sadly provides no sparks &#150; indeed, there seemed to be more drama offscreen between director John G. Avildsen and writer/producer Steve Shagan over the re-editing of the film, resulting in a compromise cut that probably satisfied no-one (it's a genuine surprise to find them jovially sharing the audio commentary on Warners' new DVD). Not that it seems that anyone else was so passionate about the film there's no shortage of class talent here (John Gielgud and Beatrice Straight also turn up), but it's clear that the paycheck is of more interest to them than the script and they're just slumming it.

Scott) who investigates the murder of his friend, a retired cop, which leads to Germany and a Nazi formula for synthetic fuel that big oil naturally wants to suppress at all costs. Marlon Brando plays a shady oil tycoon but only appears for roughly 15 minutes of the almost 2-hour runtime.The film is top-of-the-line as far as cast, location and cinematography go. It starts off like a Dirty Harry flick substituting Scott for Eastwood with his Asian sidekick, but the plot's complicated and there's not enough action for Dirty Harry fans. The rest of the film seems like an episode of Columbo mixed with Scott's Hardcore (1979) where he goes undercover in Southern California investigating his daughter's disappearance.The highlights include the WWII and Nazi elements, acting giants Scott and Brando, the lovely Marthe Keller, the rest of the cast, the great locations (California, Germany and Switzerland) and the emphasis on dialogue above thrills, which may be a detriment to some. Regarding the Nazi elements, there's a brief strip club scene in Europe where Nazi imagery is used as a backdrop for the dancers, fittingly showing how yesterday's unspeakable horrors are forgotten by the next generation and utilized for entertainment or recreation.Brando has proved time and again that he has a knack for playing weird, quirky characters (The Missouri Breaks, Apocalypse Now, The Godfather and The Island of Dr. Moreau) and he tries to do this here with his portrayal of an oil executive, but with so-so results. I didn't buy it; the character comes off as more of a performance rather than a real person. Still, you've gotta give him credit for trying and Brando is always entertaining, even when he fumbles.The main problem here is the convoluted plot. There are so many names it's hard to keep up (I recommend using the subtitles as it helps you keep track). The conclusion is both thought-provoking and unsatisfactory; a strange mix.So The Formula is a mixed bag, but its strengths outweigh it's weaknesses. It's worthwhile if you're a fan of the stars and if you're in the mood for a thought-provoking and globetrotting crime/thriller that's heavy on talk and light on thrills.This movie surprised me; after hearing all the criticisms I was ready for a dull experience, but this wasn't the case at all.GRADE B- "}{"Title":" Want  to know why fuel is so high, don't ask me, I'm only a customer  ","Date":"21 September 2012","Score":"2 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Crime, Thriller","Review":" Steve Shagan wrote this novel long before the film emerged and became a prophetic warning to the world.

The story as found in the novel begins with the murder of a retired LAPD police officer and assigned to Lt. Barney Caine (George C. Scott). Although evidence suggests the dead Officer died from Cocaine, Caine suspects it was blatant murder. With a gut feeling and growing suspicion of multiple involvement by others, Caine travels to Europe to learn who was behind the killings in America. This eventually leads to Adam Steiffel (Marlon Brando) a very rich and powerful Oil Executive based in the US who explains where and how the world works. A Plethora of Hollywood stars including John Gielgud, Marshall Thompson and Wolfgang Preiss, makes for a solid movie, but one wonders why Brando is only given minimal screen exposure.

It was that fuel, made from liquefied coal, that had Germany hold off defeat while inflicting millions of allied casualties for some two years after it's supply of oil, mostly from the Romanian Ploesti Oil Field, was obliterated by allied daylight bombings in 1943.Seeing in the spring of 1945 that the war was lost, for Germany, German General Helmut, Richard Lynch, makes a desperate dash with a truck full of Nazi secret documents towards the Swiss border only to get intercepted by a US Army patrol. It's then that Gen. Helmut makes a secret deal with US Army Major Tom Neeley, Robin Clark,to trade the documents for his safety out of the country and possible being tried as a Nazi war criminal. It's now 35 years later and Neeley now a retired L.A police chief is found murdered in his home with it made to look like it was some kind of mob hit. In fact it was but the mob wasn't the Mafia but those running the world's oil cartels.With Neeley's good friend in the LAPD Let. Barney Caine, George C. Scott, put on the case it becomes evident to him that those who ordered Neeley murdered originated, by a check on Neeley's recent travels, from Germany. That becomes even more clear to Let. Caine when within days Neeley's estranged wife Kay, Beatrice Straight, is also fund murdered in her Jacuzzi with the same murder weapon that murdered her husband! The film follows the same formula in that as soon as we're, or Let. Caine, introduced to a major character in it he, or she, ends up being murdered! Let. Caine traveling to, at that time in 1980, West Germany on official business starts to put all the loose ends in Neeley's murder together and uncovers his involvement with the Nazi Genesis Project! If the secret of the Genesis Project were made public it would put the world's oil cartels out of business!Hard to follow and very boring at times, with the action in the film about as long as a one minute TV commercial, the best part in it is the confrontation between Let. Caine and Titan Oil CEO Adam Steiffel, Marlon Brando, at the conclusion of the movie. It's that scene that explains to the audience what exactly is going on in the film.***SPOILER ALERT*** Steiffel who's the man behind all the murders in the movie comes across so likable, due to Brando's comedic mannerisms of him, that you find it hard to dislike him. In fact you look at Scott, as Let. Caine, to be more of a villain that he does in is verbally abusing the what seems like the helpless balding fat-man that Steiffel is. In the end it's Steiffel who ends up getting the last laugh by checkmating Let. Caine, despite all his efforts, in his trying to get the Genisis formula out to the public. Which shows that big bucks not morality or the public interest is the way to get things done in this world. There's also in the movie the husky voiced and very athletic looking Marthe Keller as Lisa Spangler in a role that she seemed to play in every film she was in back then; The mystery woman.

Another movie that broaches oil greed is Local Hero with Burt Lancaster playing the part of CEO Armand Hammer and his quest for acquisition of land on the northern edge of Scotland and his description of the Scottish people as blue eyed Arabs. Since the days of John D Rockefeller, oil has, for all practical purposes, ruled the world. How ironic that we are now at war with a country with the world's 2nd largest oil reserves and our leader was the one pulling the trigger.

It's a mystery/thriller in which the mystery is almost impossible to follow and the thrills are few and far between. The plot becomes confusing almost from the start and never turns itself around. Ones only reason to watch this movie would be to see two of our greatest actors, Marlon Brando and George C.Scott, performing together. Sadly even that falls short as they only have two scenes together, albeit these are the two best scenes in the movie. Brando's speech about the oil companies is terrific. Too bad the rest of the film didn't live up to that scene.I can remember that just prior to the opening of the film at Christmas of 1980 it became public knowledge that the studio (with the backing of writer Steve Shagan) took the film away from director John Avildsen. Shagan wanted many changes made so Avildsen sent a long memo to the studio outlining Shagan's apparent wrong decisions with the editing. The studio seemed to agree - somewhat. Some of Avildsen's suggestions were restored while others weren't. Thankfully the Brando speech that I mentioned above was not cut per Shagan's request. Avildsen believed that because Brando basically improvised the scene Shagan was not happy with it.Come to think of it I think I would have rather seen a movie based on the internal battles of the studio/writer and the director then this mess. Whomever is to blame, and it's probably 50-50, The Formula is a major disappointment considering all the talent involved.

At least five people get shot dead in this film. Colour me stupid, but although I've seen it three or four times I still can't figure out the motivation. Their shootings seemed arbitrary and unnecessary who gained? A misleading cocaine-dealing trail had apparently been laid down (by who?) for stolid, stone-faced cop George C Scott, but it had been deliberately framed for him not to fall for it. So what was the point? I can't figure it out. What had Mrs Kate Neeley got to do with it? Who was doing the shootings? Seems as though it was Marthe Keller, according to her body oil --- but hang on, who sent her to LA? Was Steiffel ordering the killings? Or was it the Baader-Meinhof Faction? I've read more than one summary of the plot, but none of them seem able to get it straight.Site plot summary A detective uncovers a formula that was devised by the Nazis in WWII to make gasoline from synthetic products, thereby eliminating the necessity for oil, and oil companies. A major oil company finds out about it and tries to destroy the formula and anyone who knows about it. Site plot synopsis There is no plot synopsis. Still, it seems like Steiffel must have been responsible.Perhaps, as one reviewer says, just talking to Lieutenant Scott gets you shot. Was Shagan enrolled in the Raymond Chandler school of thriller-writing? Chandler said that writing thrillers is easy if you don't know what to make happen next, bring on a man with a gun. Even better just have somebody shot. Happy Days are Here Again is not precisely rock 'n roll, so add a dash of sex and drugs.Listening to the Avildsen (born 1935) and Shagan (born 1927) special feature commentary is enlightening. Add some stimulating one-liners from the script. We are the Arabs. (Steiffel). Fiction ruins factual research. (Shagan). Walls make good neighbours. (Robert Frost --- weird that A & S wouldn't remember that famous quote). You're in the oil shortage business. No enemies --- just customers.The puzzles multiply the closer you look. Obermann's next of kin was in his wallet. That's how they got to Keller. Then how come he never had a niece? Why did phony old Gielgud dismiss Fraulein Spangler? Vy vosn't Dr Abraham Esau shot? Vy vosn't he more hairy? Shagan said he had the book in his head. This shows, since the requisite smooth transition to film never happened. Some of the shots, and sets, were visually adequately attractive, but they were static, not cinematic.Finally, if I heard him right, and it sounded as if it was confirmed by either A or S, Marlon mumbled that Jefferson said that 'Money, not morality, is the principal commerce of civilized nations'. This doesn't make any sense, if you think about it. Also, what Jefferson actually said, in his letter to John Langdon, 1810, was that Money and not morality is the principle of commerce and commercial nations. Now that does make perfect sense. Perhaps the jumbled mumble was simply Brando's quirky take on his decidedly oddball character.Brando and Scott used to play chess, when Scott was sober. Both giants were a tad tired and over-weight. Neither looked at all comfortable in his ill-fitting clothes. The film is a chess problem without a solution, but it's fairly amusing trying to find one. Could be a Queen's Pawn opener, and a draw. I must check the moves again. That old-fashioned notation is definitely dated, however.Could somebody please produce a good, clear summary/synopsis, so I can get shot of the whole hangover. It's given me a headache. By the way, I've ordered the book, in hopes it may help me clear my head and sort it out.Book arrived. Stap me vitals; and split me windpipe. There's that Jefferson misquote again ! Money not morality is the principal commerce of civilized nations. Why can't Yanks speak English?

It had a really bad feel to it on a made for TV movie level, so I kept it in the background so I could get some snippets as this looked really really boring and it's all that was on at the time. Anyway if your political bents swing towards the Greenpeace crowd than you will rate this a 7 to 10, since I'm on the other end of the political spectrum it gets a 2. I love secret Nazi formula thriller stuff, and one that holds as much promise as the formula here did along with Scott should have come much better. That said the movies only redeeming qualities was it's similarities of Brando's character to Dick Chaney, and the speech in the end when Scott says Your the reason why old people have to eat out of garbage cans!. That and a weird scene with strippers on stage in Germany with swastika pasties on, that was kind of interesting, you had to be there. I think both of these actors pulled some stunts during the academy awards and they were the forerunners of todays mostly leftist Hollywood actor crowd, and this movie has a clear political bent to appeal to that audience with dialog like the old people and trash cans. I'm surprised he didn't mention anything about soup lines, but I might have just missed it as this movie was hard to stay focused on and for once I preferred to do some work than follow this boring drivel. 2 of 10 stars, Scott didn't make all that many truly great movies in his career, but I certainly remember the ones he did do, this one wont be remembered as one though.

Yeah. Right. What would they care? Which oil companies? Time and President Reagan proved the premise of this film to be false, a self-serving propaganda piece perhaps crafted to make Jimmy Carter, look good and win a second term. This would likely have resulted in us speaking Russian, those fortunate enough to survive, wouldn't it?The oil companies along with the American people in 1980 were enduring The Carter Glory Years, when both moslem radical and soviet thugs held America hostage, with the apparent approval of the commander in chief. One of the ways in which these intergenerational, symbiotically relatedhead lice held us for ransom was by means of 'oil embargoes'. OPEC constantly engineered 'oil shortages' throughout the 70s, starting in the fall of '73.The Carter Glory Years featured inane 'Big Bad Oil' fairy tales, invented by leftists and repeated by the uninformed. One tale was that oil companies were sitting on trillions of gallons of oil, awaiting a mysterious price hike. Another was the fatuous muth about 'the guy up in Maine who invented a seventy - the number steadily rose from seventy to one hundred to two hundred and beyond - mile per gallon carburetor but Big Bad Oil Companies and Evil Detroit stole his patent and destroyed his plans.That's the false premise of this film, which explains why it's patently stupid, boring, and false. If we'd only stop and THINK about that which we hear, eh? Ask yourself, what oil company and/or car maker could get away with it? Answer none. Ask yourself, what oil company and/or car maker wouldn't love to be the first to market a new car line with a two-hundred mile per gallon carburetor? Every one would love to do so, wouldn't they?This fairy tale's silliness was compounded by the fact that by the 1980s, computer controlled carburetors were being supplanted by fuel injection. That said, a gallon of gas can push a given weight only so far and no more, no matter what some 'guy up in Maine' claims to have invented.With Hollywood, if you want to know the truth, turn the lies in its movies 180 degrees around and you'll have it.Interestingly, within a couple years of The Formula's release, President Reagan got government out of the oil business, and gas became plentiful and cheap. This permanently angered The Left as well as sore loser Mr. Peanuts, but facts are facts.Would you expect any different from Hollywood? Why? Didn't both Lenin and Stalin say, 'give me Hollywood and I'll control the world'? You think they just sat back went to sleep after saying that?Marta Keller is beautiful to behold and George C. Scott is as always, a barely contained hi-voltage dynamo of psychic energy.Boring? It's no different from British horror films in which the monster never shows up for curtain call but instead you listen - for two hours running time - to professorial British gents discussing the beast as they sip Port in the walnut panelled drawing room of a country estate located a discrete distance to the west of London.Paul Vincent ZecchinoMassive Critic at Critial MassManasoviet Key, Florida26 January, 2012 "},{"Title":"This formula didn't work.","Date":"28 July 2002","Score":"2 out of 7 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Crime, Thriller","Review":"  What a waste of talent.George C Scott looked almost disinterested.Brando looked and acted like a pretentious idiot.Beatrice Straight must have felt lucky to be shot so early in the movie.The editing was very poor and with such a complicated plot this only added to the sense of incomprehension that descended whilst watching this dire film.It appeared that the whole story was some sort of warning about the way global conglomerates are controlling oil production and prices.Why spend so much time and money to tell us something we could get from the front page of The Observer or The Independant?

The poor cinema goers who paid 7 bucks got a confusing trite plot and not one laugh. When are the writers/producers/and actors going to get over their  envy over successful people in other lines of work. Its ridiculous to think some one person, or company, or county could control a formulae such as the subject of this movie. Equally as stupid, is the popularized idea that the oil companies keep down the mileage of cars. If one company in one country could produce a 4,000 lb. SUV that got 100 miles to the gallon, don't you think that we Americans would buy such a car. The fiction that Oil and Car manufacturers are in a conspiracy is another hoax Hollywood likes to perpetuate. Their are no car manufacturers in the Middle East, and none worth mentioning in Mexico, Venezuela or the Central and West Asia or Indoesia. Conversely, Japan, one of the largest exporter of decent cars, buys all of its oil. Our kids are hardly educated when they leave school, lets not dumb them done anymore Hollywood. "}]
