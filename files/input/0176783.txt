This reception was possibly due to the generally slow box office of April 2000, but also to the fact that, at times, the film's style compensates for its lack of substance. Still, the film is a fun way to spend a few hours and the screenplay provides a unique story.The acting is pretty good, especially from the three leads - Lena Headey (Cathy), James Marsden (Derrick) and Norman Reedus (Travis). I saw Headey in some other films after this one, namely Face and Ripley's Game, and was impressed not only by her emotional range, but also by her mastery of accents. Both Marsden and Reedus are better actors than they are given credit for.The film's style and locales epitomize what I would personally call 'twenty-first century chic'. The loft is ultra cool, and so is the club. In fact, the film is worth seeing for its locales alone.Overall, a nice little thriller. I give it a 7/10.

I was pleasantly surprised at the discussion engendered by viewing the film in a classroom setting.  The students responded enthusiastically and thoughtfully to the many ethical issues presented.  I recommend the film for this purpose.The first 80 minutes or so of this 90 minute suspense thriller reminded me of some of the earlier films of Brian DePalma.  It is nicely shot at an urban university (NYU?), and the colors and angles add to the introduction of the main plot device - an innocent rumor started as a group project for a communications arts class.  Notice how many right angles and sharp points are present in the party and residential settings.  The students felt this contributed to the intended feeling of edginess engendered by the first 20 minutes.The first 80 minutes are well-conceived and intricately-plotted. The plot reveals itself at an excruciatingly pleasurable pace, and a nice twist is that the character of Derek appears to know no more than we, the audience, do.The ending is abrupt and somewhat derivative, but, in post-viewing discussion, we were able to identify a number of clues to the ending which the director has sprinkled throughout.A dark, cine noir feeling to the production results in a film a bit out of step with the 21st century, but one that should be satisfying to fans of the genre.

But it definitely left something to be desired. The plot starts out well and is very intriguing. However, the story takes some twists and turns that make it confusing and unbelievable.The plot begins with three college friends, Cathy (Lena Headey, The Devil's Advocate,) Derek (James Marsden, Disturbing Behavior,) and Travis (Norman Reedus, Deuces Wild,) who find they are very good at starting rumors. They decide to use this talent to do an experiment for a class in which they begin a rumor, track it around campus, and see how it changes and spreads. The poor subjects of their experiment are Beau (Joshua Jackson, TV's Dawson's Creek) and Naomi (Kate Hudson, Almost Famous.) While at a party, Derek discovers a situation between Beau and Naomi that soon becomes the rumor. However, when the rumor takes a drastic turn and students start accusing Beau of rape, Cathy and Travis must try and convince Derek that what they've started may lead to something worse. And when Naomi is found dead, the three roomates must fight among themselves and their consciences to fix a rumor that gave them more than what they bargained for. James Marsden gives an excellent, evil performance. Norman Reedus puts a lot into his character that excels in the end. And Joshua Jackson gives a wonderful performance as a wrongly accused man. I found Lena Headey and Kate Hudson's acting somewhat bland and boring. The movie seems to try too hard when trying to surprise you. In fact, it tries so hard that it creates way too many I have an ulterior motive and I'm not what you think I am side stories.

The viewer is left to think about the harmless thing called gossip, and about the views and moral codes of today's young generation.   It is pleasant to note that the characters are quite realistic.  We have all known, in high school and college such artistic weirdos as Travis, such hysterical golden girls as Naomi, such intellectuals as Kathy Jones, and such successful athletes as Derrick--popular and admired, and yet feared somehow, for the little diabolical flash in their behavior.  It is a tribute to the talent and skill of these actors that they inspire belief in the viewer while playing the roles of abstracts.   It should be noted particularly that James Marsden, usually an underestimated actor, manages by his skill to inspire sympathy, and in the end, a certain amount of bewildered admiration for his character.  One may argue whether lying and manipulation are immoral--but doing both of them well, and professionally, is worthy of respect.   To conclude--this is a film that is rare in the genre of youth films, in that it gets the viewer to sit back and think about the life these characters live, and the life which all of us saw firsthand in school and college.  The life of gossip, of lies, rumors, reputations . . . a life in which words have power over reality.  The Director shows this well, and the talented and skilled actors make us believe in the reality of their characters, their deeds, their emotions, and their thoughts.

Hmmm... Reflectively, that's a pretty good premise for a light comedy. Or, a gritty reality show. I'm sure I'll see it next year, after somebody reads this and works it into a million dollars I won't share, but you saw it here first, folks! Moving on. This brief sojourn afforded me several nights alone, left to shift for myself. Evidently, 21 year old girls go out EVERY night. Naturally, I thought to while away some time with a fine feature film.Enter culture shock. It seems that young women of this age possess very little of what their parents would consider watchable, let alone entertaining. However, sandwiched between classic Disney films, Bum Fights and a preponderance of films starring Orlando Bloom and Silent Bob, I found Gossip.Deciding to give it a try, I spent the next hour and a half or so with a growing feeling of nausea. This is a very disturbing film. The premise seems harmless enough. Three college students (James Marsden, Lena Hedley, Norman Reedus) decide to start an ugly rumor on campus for a class project. They claim that a friend, Beau (Joshua Jackson) had sexual intercourse with an unconscious date, Naomi (Kate Hudson) a notoriously virginal girl. Vicious as this seems, it remains relatively harmless until well meaning interference by other students convinces Naomi she has been date raped, and this baseless, thoughtless lie becomes a criminal matter.As a parent, this is a Class A nightmare. I STILL worry, much to my daughter's disgust. But, I also have a son, and the hellish circumstances faced by innocent Beau and his family resonates as well.The performances of all of the young up and coming actors, none of whom, except Hudson, I have seen before, is earnest and intense, especially as the situation spirals out of control. Edward James Olmos is, as always, utterly convincing as the detective assigned to the case.What I find so disturbing about the film is that it fails to make the point that gossip and rumors like these are not only ugly, they can be utterly destructive. Even if the subject is cleared in the end, the psychological damage to him, the girl, and both of their families is ongoing. I happen to be a big believer in justice, and I would have liked to have seen the three students responsible seriously punished, criminal records of their own being the least of the consequences.I am also disturbed by the opinions of others regarding this film. Comments that solely praise the beauty of an actress or the excellent directing, and say NOTHING about the subject. In fact, one went so far as to state that this is just the way things are on a college campus. How sad is that? How far has our society's moral standards fallen as to brush this off as nothing unusual? This Life Sucks.. So What? attitude is more frightening than the threat of nuclear war. Dress it up any way you want, Gossip is a revisiting of the Salem Witch Trials. The general consensus that no one seems to care, or feel that the instigators deserve vilification, at the least, both sickens and scares the hell out of me.Aside from that, there were serious reality flaws in the script. Forensic evidence, for one, or the lack of even more than a brief mention of it. The evil of Marsden's Derek revealed as if it were justification, both for the initial lie and the subsequent actions of the other two conspirators. The quick, and almost too pat ending.This film had an opportunity to make a powerful statement about the effect these kinds of vicious head games have on the innocent. A good film can go far in the changing of perceptions, attitudes, even actions of those who watch it. Unfortunately, Gossip fails in its chance. I give this film an overall six because of the dedication of the cast. Other than that, I cannot recommend this film as anything other than a sad, sad commentary on the lack of moral standards of the up and coming generation. God help us if they don't wake up.

Nothing that would make my favorite shelf, but a movie I could definitely watch a few times a year. It's got an interesting plot and story-line, and most of the actors were top notch.Now that being said, there were two things that kept this movie from being an excellent movie. The first one was Lena Headey; her acting was mediocre at best, and in certain parts, down right awful. But this normally wouldn't be enough to knock off too many points, but the second problem... The ending -while decent- was definitely one that required you to suspend your disbelief. It leaves you wondering, What was the point?.But the acting by James Marsden, and Norman Reedus were amazing, and almost make up for it. Marsden plays the manipulative liar, who really isn't a bad guy, one who almost leaves you feeling a certain amount of pity at the end. Reedus was amazing; probably one of my favorite performances from him. The shy, SoHo, bohemian artist thing works really well for him. The interaction between the two men are some of the most interesting parts of the movie, and show the dominant/subservient or leader/follower relationship perfectly.Passable performances by Joshua Jackson and Kate Hudson. Nothing stellar, but nothing to complain about either.Again... Decent movie, one that could have been a hit with a few tweaks, and a different actress for Jones, but nothing that will make a 'favorites' list any time soon.

And, even though explained away by an alleged substantial allowance, his apartment is perhaps too glitzy and fashionable for a college student. The thesis that Webb, Jones and Travis cook up together is too vague and spontaneous to be of practical use for study purposes. The debate over the rape and murder charges are unlikely to be used for teaching purposes as Professor Goodwin permits, the finale is far too elaborate to be convincing, and so on.But there is also much to enjoy here not least of which is a plot which, until the final few minutes brings the prerequisite closure that American audiences seem to crave, is clever, unpredictable and thought provoking. Guggenheim can claim Michael Lehmann's now classic 'Heathers' (1989) asone inspiration for 'Gossip'. Kate's introductory remarks'I'm a girl with a problem. I know better, but I have got myself in a very tempting situation'recalls Veronica's infatuation and self-analysis in the earlier film. Webb's mysterious charm can be compared to that of Jason Dean's, while both films share a college ethos, a sense of practical jokes spinning mercilessly out of control - a plot momentum that is only stopped with an unsatisfying ending. The slickness of 'Gossip' betrays its more recent provenance, and one is left feeling that a grittier, more documentary approach might have suited its subject more, particularly as it lacks Lehmann's ironic intensity. Fortunately the direction of Guggenheim's film is right on the button and sweeps matters along so that, for most of the time it doesn't matter that some sharpness is lost. Guggenheim's work within television has obviously led him to make some observations on the effects of the mass media. Such reflections are articulated most clearly by the McLuhanite Professor Goodwin, whose lectures bring most of the principals together, or are expressed in more practical terms by Travis. A shambling and reclusive figure, in many ways he is the most interesting character in the film and one wishes that his role had been expanded to articulate more of this obsessions. His enlargements and manipulations of Naomi's image in his TV den speak volumes about intrusion into personal space and it is entirely apposite that Webb's downfall should be captured on a monitor.At the heart of 'Gossip' are many such intrusions. Specifically, the rapes, allegations of rape, and confession of rape, each echoing one another, driving the plot. Webb's earlier encounter with Naomi, his struggle with her on the bed during which she scratches his cheek, his uncertain sexual coupling with Jones, Noami's allegations concerning Beau&#133; all these are linked by allegation and gossip. Significantly, the same line is uttered by Naomi to Beau, as she asks him to explain himself, as when Jones interrogates Webb about his role in matters 'that's not an answer'. There is, of course, no real effective 'answer' to rumour. It is always a wayward invention of reality which, as Travis knows, just needs to be 'good, simple, and with room to grow'. As his name suggests, Webb can 'spin' a yarn, catch people by their credulity and it will run its course, as for the most part people are content to go along with it and enjoy it.Spoiler ahead!Interestingly, the 'pilgrimatic' Jones (a reference to her perceived decency throughout), confirms the pervasive nature of rumour, when she contrives the scenario that forces Webb's confession. The 'death' of Naomi is conveyed to Webb third hand and 'confirmed' by the word of others. It is of course still only rumour, but under semblance of a reliable report. Fittingly, Webb is completely taken in when his own weapon is used against him. By the end of the film, as she admit, Jones has acquired, albeit in a good cause, guile and deceiving skills of her own. Her own satisfaction at her use of methods she had previously condemned, may be tempered by sadness. But the audiences' pleasure in following through the train of events that unfold, and realising that it was all fabricated, only emphasises the truth of Webb's exercise.

Now I realize that most people don't really like this film, for one reason or another, however this film has some of the most amazing qualities that filmmakers neglect to acknowledge in today's filmmaking. One of which is the anatomy-and assemble of the cast. The main and supporting cast alone is one of the reasons that I first wanted to watch the film. James Marsden gives an absolutely enthralling performance that should be more recognized in his career. I see no real holes in his acting and his character makes me wish that we could see more of those characters in films today. When James was in this film he was just getting his career going and, what some might say he was somewhat young in that stage of his career, we should hope to see such hard work, attention to character and determination in today's 'upcoming stars', as he did then. Derrick Webb is a character, I for one, hope to see more often in thrillers in the near future. Derrick's interesting appeal to women, and the fact that he is rich, makes it so much more enjoyable. Not to mention his character's thrilling change and turn of events; where at one stage we actually feel sorry for the guy for being a different type of 'freak'. Travis, played by Norman Reedus is one of those characters that I love, to delve into his artistic expressions and talent, and not to mention Norman's gripping performance as yet another type of 'artistic freak' in the film. So basically I love almost everything in this film from Joshua Jackson (and his performance) to the actual storyline as well. Furthermore, the camera lens and series of close ups at thrilling points of the film are absolutely brilliant, which again I wish filmmakers put into today's movies more often. Say what you will about Gossip but I completely love this film, and find myself watching it over and over again for multiple reasons. So it all comes down to great acting, and not only good looking actors (that we don't see as much today, as we should), great storyline, great camera shots and angles. One for the ages in my opinion (that should really get higher ratings than 5.6).

Fortunately for the creators, the movie works out better than one thought up to the contrived finale. There are things that don't make sense, but one goes along just for the ride.

I'll admit, I saw it because James Marsden was in it, and I was surprised by his edgy role. Gossip centers around three college students, Cathy, known to everybody as Jones, who seems like a normal college girl, Travis, the off-the-wall artist who has a different mind which he shows in his work, namely his room, and Derrick, the arrogant, quick- talking schmoozer who can lie his way in or out of any situation, who owns the apartment the three share. What starts as Derrick defending a girl in a class, where he states, We're people, and we do what we do... I like gossip. It's fun. This leads Jones to come up with their project for the class; start a rumor, track it and see where it leads. That night, the three attend a party. Jones is taking pictures outside when she bumps into rich girl Naomi, getting out of a town car with her boyfriend, Beau. Jones takes a picture of them going inside then scoffs once they've left (Who arrives to a party in the meat-packing district in a town car?) When Derrick and his date are in the bathroom while she gets sick, Derrick sees Naomi and Beau making out. Beau tries to push Naomi, but she stops him. Shortly after, from having too much to drink, she passes out and Beau leaves. Derrick sees this and gets the idea for their rumor. The next morning, hungover Jones is hesitant to go through with it; Derrick teases her about not being able to be mean (You're from Plymouth, with the Pilgrims and there were no mean Pilgrims) so Cathy tells Naomi's best friend she slept with Beau. Naomi hears the rumor and is afraid Beau raped her. Things go wrong. Beau gets arrested, Cathy starts doubting the plan, Naomi can't stand to hear Derrick's name, and Derrick doesn't tell the truth until he's absolutely backed into a corner. Was Gossip a world-turning film? Probably not. Do more than a handful of people know it exists? Again, probably not. Did it really need to be rated R? Once again, probably not. But it's a good movie to see once. It's edgy and a little dark but there are some dare-I-say cute moments. If you see it in the video store or better the library, rent it.

Also it hit hard with its message about what a rumor can do. The story not always hold on because it felt unrealistic and exaggerated. The music/score was good and it added intensity to the movie. I truly recommend this movie to anyone looking for a more original and intriguing than the usual teen movie, i would say its very fun too.

How were they going to prove their thesis to their professor? 2. When did everyone decide to expose Derrick? Was the thesis all a ploy to make him admit his past misdeeds? 3. WHY did everyone turn on Derrick? His character definitely wasn't as evil as SMG in Cruel Intentions. 4. Are we supposed to sympatise with Naomi. She wasn't a particularly nice person, so I couldn't see why everyone teamed up to help her in the end.The acting was good- Lena Headey was good as the conscience of the group, Norman Reedus' character took a mad,obsessive tangent midway into the film and James Marsden was good as Derrick- but he wasn't EVIL. Of what little we see of Kate Hudson's character doesn't endear her to us. If she was trying to illicit sympathy, she failed.The movie starts out as a drama, but then turns thriller, leaving behind the interesting take of the REALISTIC damage in starting a rumour.

Starring a very colorful twenty-something crowd we are taken into the world of university, where three roommates (James Marsden, Lena Headey, Norman Reedus) all take a class talking about the value and destruction that can be wielded by the simple juicy bit of gossip. As an experiment in the cultures, the threesome decides to spin a little yarn and track how intense the aftermath can be.Their guinea pigs are a beauty queen who won't have sex with her man and her man who claims he actually did have sex. Obviously this explodes into a rape investigation and threesome is caught wondering who is telling the truth, what is that person hiding and what exactly did happen.`Gossip' is the type of film that isn't juicy or even amounts to anything really interesting. What we do end up with is a lot of potential in a cast. Such stand-outs or gems in this film are three of the female leads who include Lena Headey, Marisa Coughlan, and Kate Hudson. These three actresses need better parts in far better films. Lots of these twenty-something actors are solid and wonderful. The only thing missing from this Williamson-type film was the homosexual male struggling with his sexuality.The male quotient of this film was domineered by the overly exhausting villain played viciously by James Marsden. Marsden is another actor who has never been given a chance at a better role.Gossip's sex scenes are short and anti-climatic and even bridge on torturous. Where is the passion and exhilaration often associated with the tantalizing of attractive leads? There is more steam in daytime.The analysis above does beg the questions, did anyone really love or care for another and were these people really shocked that a sex crime was actually committed? None of the characters in the whole entire film really lent any emotional connection to their sex lives or to the people they were supposed to be involved with. Without this emotional connection I found this film vacuous. (1.5 of 5).

When Bo is arrested Cathy does some investigating. Derek argues whether they can arrest you based on what people believe?

James Marsden plays a real heat seeker bent on deception and popularity that can unravel at any moment. Lena Headey plays the guilt ridden gossip who seeks answers. Kate Hudson is featured as a gossip target who becomes the greater victim. Joshua Jackson becomes another victim when his reputation is on the line after being arrested. Norman Reedus plays Marsden's and Headey's roommate with an eye for the arts.

Essentially he never says anything more sophisticated than what the (coincidence or subtle racism?) African-American girl says to open with... basically just that gossip is fun.  Gee, give him an 'A+'.  Made the film sit with me funny right from the start.Then the film progesses into an over-produced high art (yet really blatant) display of the plot.

Come on, this isn't Dr. Zhivago here.  And the kid who said he was broke had only about $50,000 worth of multimedia equiptment in his room.  AND WHAT was up with how that dude found a way to make it art?  Did anyone follow his complex schematic for his piece that later sort of deteriorated into just a simple collage?

James Marsden (last seen in Disturbing Behavior, with Josh Jackson's fellow Creeker Katie Holmes) and Marisa Coughlan (Teaching Mrs.Tingle) give wonderful performances and Kate Hudson does well as the innocent victim.There are lots of twists and turns in this movie, so it may be somewhat confusing, but overall it is a good story.  The only problem with this pic, is the length of time it takes to actually get to the climax.  The first 30 mins, drags on for a while but the ending is fairly good.  Another problem I think was that the movie was advertised as starring Joshua Jackson when in reality he was only in it for a few short scenes and had minimal dialouge.  Most of the generation X'ers will go to see it for Josh Jackson and will be disappointed in that respect, but will find that in waiting for the scenes with Jackson in them, they will get wrapped up in the story anyway (which was probably the studios intent anyway).Over all, Gossip is not the world's greatest film, but who really expected it to be anyway.  Good acting, good story, bad production.  This film could be so much more, but hey!

The premise ? In an unidentified major Univeristy, presumably in the US, a group of college classmates, who are also roommates, take on a human/social experiment about the nature of gossip. They spread a rumor about the richest girl on campus, pretty, blonde Naomi Preston (Kate Hudson) who was once the girlfriend of the guy who is now exploiting her, Derrick Webb (James Marsden). Derrick and his wickedly careless and insensitive, cruel friends/roommates Cathy and Travis (Lena Headey and Norman Reedus) begin to spread the gossip concerning Naomi's date rape experience as well as other vicious and damaging lies. Before long, the entire school believes the lie and Naomi finds herself in the middle of a media circus and a public courthouse trial case. But she is determined to expose her colleagues and their malicious experiment and scheme. She consults investigators, among them Detective Curtis (portrayed by Latino actor Edward James Olmos) to seek out those who wronged her. Before long, Derrik, Cathy and Travis find themselves in big trouble and attempt to cover up their evil deed. This may not be a very powerful film or even a very great one, but it has a truthfulness and realism, played out with a what if kind of scenario that really carries the film, not to mention the great cast of actors giving it their all, despite being very young and good looking actors. As such, this film is for a young audience. At times, it appears as if it's an intensely dark soap opera intense and dark soap opera in which good looking people set out to harm others. In this case, it's a lot like Cruel Intentions ,which had been in theaters only a year earlier in 1999 (it had also starred Joshua Jackson and other hot young stars)which was in itself a modern take on the French novel and film Dangerous Liasions. Clearly, the success of that film made this film possible. This is a very disturbing film and it's not suitable for even pre-adolescents, despite the young cast. It's really a dark drama about young adults but it's adult nonetheless. There is enough R rated material here to indicate that is intended to be viewed by a mature audience- violence, graphic sex (including rape) and profane language. Even with all this, the college classroom scenes are by far what provides the film with meaning. The professor and his student's conversations and eventual reactions to the rumor experiment is proof that people do indeed love gossip, but it's harmful and it dehumanizes and corrupts our society. The battle of the sexes discussion is also quite interesting and very well-handled. But the movie's heart lies in the fact that Derek Webb is the type of corrupt young man that actually exists out there and may be getting away with crimes, and all the more so because he looks harmless and is an attractive white male. Thus, this film is a caution tale, though this film is hardly Lifetime material, possibly because it has the independent Hollywood film signature all over it. I hope this movie opens people's eyes about gossip and about lies and how to value the truth which is the greatest human gift of all.

Why is smart Jones having sex with the X-Man when she knows his insert-and-discard history -- especially when she's living under his roof? Why is a club's bathroom next to a bedroom, with just a latch-handle door between them? Did the Dawson's Creek guy really go and leave the club with his girlfriend passed out on the bed? Wasn't she mad about THAT? And then it gets around to ending. Woo-hoo! I was already writhing on my bed, overwhelmed by the utter absurdity, but then it went RIGHT over the top. What was already implausible was made doubly so. I still can't untangle the inconsistencies of this film. If the ending is to be believed (snicker), then what about that big, bad investigation? Such as when the female investigator tells Jones how she's not such an a-hole, etc. That scene logically fits in HOW? And that last dialog exchange is such a howler! THOSE were the best lines that were decided upon? Wimpy and eye-roll-inducing. I was surprised that Paul Haggis didn't direct this film. Gossip is bad. It can hurt people, and sometimes the gossip can be turned against its source and hurt the source, too -- and might even land him or her in PRISON.

Three college kids, as part of a project, attempt to spread the rumour that one prudish girl, Naomi (Kate Almost Famous Hudson)- who had been a virgin - had sex with a guy she was seen with - Beau (Joshua Dawson's Creek Jackson). They then see how the rumour goes, and watch as it spirals out of control (as it would do).Gossip has some flaws. James X-Men Marsden plays the centre character of Derrick Webb, who becomes embroiled in his own web of lies. He's grand but he's too much of a pretty boy to try and play a character who has an under-current of darkness running through him, as Webb does. His character is also extraordinary rich - I don't exaggerate when I say that one bedroom, in his student apartment, is larger than a fair few student apartments that I have seen. There's also the implausibility of the gossiping - students sure do gossip, but a sexual encounter wouldn't spread such as it does. Part of the problem there is most people just don't care and wouldn't know the person involved, but we'll leave that aside.How does the plot work? Fairly well. I didn't guess the twist ending which was a somewhat silly and contrived end (and quite unbelievable). The pacing, in the beginning, was fairly slow but that's okay because the gossip does take a while to fly out of control (at which point the pacing picks up). The acting is generally okay with the most note-worthy performance going to Hudson (though it's hardly a standout).I enjoyed Gossip for a diverting 90 minutes of my time. It's no classic, and you're quite likely to forget it - particularly with a twist that's absurd rather than smart. Don't go to any bother to catch it, but if you've some time to kill, you could do a lot worse.

Yes, we needed a half hour to get the message that college students do this every now and then. Who would have thought? The acting in this movie struck me as second rate. There wasn't a single performer who stood out to me; who grabbed my attention.

Director of  photography Andrzej Bartkowiak, who just finished Romeo Must Die, captures the film's atmosphere with a sense of intrigue and allure. Production designer David Nichols contributes skillful imagination in building an effective mood for the film. With such a cunning outer appearance, one must ask oneself if a movie can succeed just because of a good taste of style. Without a doubt, the answer is no. Gossip stars James Marsden, Lena Headley, and Norman Reedus as Derrick Webb, Jones, and Travis, college students who travel from party to party, drink booze until they pass out, and spread seemingly false rumors about their fellow classmates. Their professor (Eric Bogosian), gets them to rap about lying which gives Derrick an idea he, Jones and Travis will make up a rumor and see just how quickly it spreads. They use an incident involving rich snobs Beau (Joshua Jackson) and Naomi (Kate Hudson) who could have been involved with date rape after a wild party. Derrick says Naomi was drunk and taken advantage of, and the gossip continues like a wild fire.The plot soon becomes murderously twisted; we learn of past incidences between several characters. The audience begins to question if Beau actually did have sex with Naomi that night. The so-called victim believes she was raped herself. There may be more to Derrick's motives than meets the eye, and when the good-hearted Jones becomes suspicious of strange coincidences involving him, things really start to boil.Derrick's original reasoning for passing tattles is not clear. The Joshua Jackson and Kate Hudson characters are the least developed in entire production, yet the two are the center of the story. Perhaps if we knew more about these characters we would have become more involved. The characters need explanation for the audience to form opinions about them.Davis Guggenheim's drama contains suspenseful and mysterious overtones in the second half of its story. As the movie advances and the stakes increase, the tension becomes consistent and effective. I thoroughly enjoyed the final act of this motion picture.Gossip is a good looking movie, occupied with a swank soundtrack and attractive, well-cast performers. However, the filmmakers do not take advantage of the young stars. In a movie about spreading gossip about sex and treachery, you would expect the story to have many contorted sex scenes featuring steamy encounters and bare body parts. Gossip holds out on the viewer expecting explicitly and sexuality, and instead uses blathering dialogue to withhold its material. The R-rating comes from its theme and sexual dialogue, nothing to do with sensuality or nudity. At least similar films Cruel Intentions had shocking wit and twisted audacity, and Body Shots portrayed date rape as brutal and sadistic material. Gossip is just a whole lot of gibber-jabber.

The script doesn't do that well at setting up the interesting idea (opting for a lazy lecture genesis) or even delivering it but it doesn't make the concept any less interesting although it does eventually just start to morph into a standard teen thriller &#150; all style, breaking glass and running. Likewise the characters are very clichéd spoilt student types who worked because I didn't care so much for them as actively look forward to seeing their selfish, rich world implode on them. Dislike is probably not enough to base a film on but it was enough to hold my interest here.Guggenheim can't manage to do much with the idea other than let the silly teen thriller unfold but at least he injects style into it &#150; helped greatly by good sets (even if they just made me dislike the preppy spoilt lives of the students all the more!). The cast match the stylish but empty tone of the film &#150; Marsden in particular being pretty but unable to do much more than just deliver the basic script. Reedus has a thankless task of being the red-herring, crazy character while Headey turns in a solid enough moral compass character. A young Kate Hudson doesn't do much and when Eric Bogosian is the big cameo in any film then you know things aren't up to much.Overall this is an OK teen-style thriller that has an interesting idea at its core but ultimately does nothing with it apart from just what you would expect from the genre. It all looks good, has a pretty young cast and produces a thriller that will not put any pressure on you to get involved or to think things through. Glossy, undemanding fare that will distract at best.

Part of the problem is that the film never comes across as particularly convincing, either in its setting or in its characters.  The film takes place on a college campus located in Manhattan filled with the types of students that make the rest of us feel as if we wasted our own college years attending dull dry lectures and writing lengthy term papers when we could have been having so much more fun creating scandals and sending the entire institution into fits of apoplexy.    Not only do these students never crack open a book or put pen to paper, but even the one class we see them attending turns out to be a seminar on the role of gossip in the media.  Doesn't anybody ever study the classics anymore?  The main characters even live in one of those impossibly dank, dark cavernous artist lofts that only people in movies ever seem to occupy.The film centers around three college buddies &#150; two males and one female, naturally &#150; who share not only an apartment but also a penchant for spreading fictionalized stories about themselves to get what they want (usually something insignificant like free drinks).  One day the young lady, `Jones,' suggests that they start a rumor about a snooty little rich girl who has recently transferred to the school and track the story's progress as part of a research project for a media class they are taking.  I guess this is what passes for research methodology these days now that books have become passé even in academic settings.  (You'll note that no one involved in the `study' ever attempts to document any of the findings on paper once the rumor has been successfully launched.  How were they planning to get a grade on the assignment?).  It's obvious that the makers of the film believe themselves to be making some sort of profound statement on the dangers of rumor mongering &#150; you know, about how easy it is to start a rumor but how hard it is to control it, etc. &#150; but the characters seem at times so dimwitted that it becomes impossible to take any of it very seriously.  Jones is supposed to be the compassionate, rational one among the trio yet she seems genuinely surprised when the little experiment goes awry in ways that to us seem entirely predictable.  Credit the filmmakers with at least presenting characters who are marginally ambiguous on a moral level, but we find it hard to believe that a genuinely good, caring person like Jones would have come up with such an idea in the first place.Moreover, the film features one of those surprise `turnabout' endings, the sheer logistics of which strain credibility to the breaking point.  In fact, since the ending is telegraphed way in advance anyway, it fails both on the level of suspense as well as credibility.`Gossip' tries hard to be taken seriously, but in the end both its own air of contrivance and our own sense of incredulity manage to do it in.

Not quite.  Disappointing is perhaps a better word, and that's because it fails to live up in either cleverness or craftsmanship to the rest of the movie.  One thing that can be said in its favour - how do I put this, so as not to give anything away? - is that if, like me, you spent the entire film having little idea what was about to happen next, the slightly muffed and over-elaborate conclusion will come as a pleasant surprise.  We're led to expect - again, how do I put this? - late nineteenth-century Italian opera.Gossip is much more of a clever, well-crafted, involving film than you might think, especially since everyone has been so mean to it.  The uni students are more plausible than they usually are in American movies, no character who's meant to be likeable isn't, and the ideas - the purely narrative ideas - are all interesting.  ONE implausibility is worth mentioning, however.The story is this.  Three students decide to plant a false rumour - the but of the rumour being two people they don't much care for - in order to see how it spreads.  Anyone who has seen any movie knows that they're just ASKING for the gods to smite them.  And yes, the gods smite them.  Events spin out of control like you wouldn't believe.So what's the rumour they plant?  Get this Naomi and Beau ... you know, the couple, they're dating, they were at that party together...?  Well, they had SEX.  Gasp.  How many people would bother to repeat, or even remember, such a rumour?  I'd be more likely to comment on their drinking unusual cocktails.Suchlike motivational weaknesses are the only telling flaws.

Here, we think we are observing a simple effect where the characters make up the story for others of the characters. The twist, of course, is that the writers and players get combined. Nothing new here, except the notion of the `third man,' the artist friend who creates wall art (not unlike movies, no?), mirroring the creation of the film.

The film does lose a lot of goodwill with a lazy twist ending that provides easy answers and will change the way you look at the film on second viewing, I'd suggest for the worst.As mentioned above, the film is about three room mates, Derrick, Cathy and Travis who are all attending college together. Inspired by a communications lecture on Gossip (because of course everyone pays attention during college lectures) she decides to start a rumor and then track how it spreads. They go to a party and see Beau (Joshua Jackson) making out with save it till marriage virgin Naomi (Kate Hudson). So they decide to spread the rumor that the two slept together.The rumor quickly gets out of control, and people start believing that Naomi was raped. Unfortunately for Beau, she became unconscious that night and believes the rumor too, so Beau is up- on rape charges. From there this actually is a pretty good look at date rape and consequences. However this is ruined by the twist ending, which actually throws all of that insight away in order to tell a story of complicated revenge.Look. I give this a tick because it is well made and stylistically directed by Davis Guggenheim. It looks at serious themes, and for much of the duration, does these themes justice. However the ending is either to make or break the film for you. And I would suggest it would break the film for most viewers. However, if you were dissed b y the ending, watch the film again. It actually is a different experience the second time around and it is not terrible as a revenge flick.Anyway, not bad, but could have been infinitely better had it stuck to the issues of date rape and gossip culture.
