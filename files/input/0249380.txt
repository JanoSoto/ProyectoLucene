This is an interesting film, even if you think it's 'crap'. Why is it that all the men I know who've watched it, think it's crap? I teach this film as part of a course and without fail all male students thus far have said it's 'not porn' and the thing they most objected to was seeing 'grannies doin' it'. Could it be the fact that for once we actually see men's faces when they come that disturbs so much? What we never or rarely see in porn, is a male appearing vulnerable. In Baise-Moi this is explored. As is said above, yes the 'plot' may be virtually non-existent, but isn't that the case with most regurgitated mainstream films anyway? This film isn't about stimulating an audience sexually, be they male or female, indeed it is just as objectionable to women as it is to men. But I do believe that the reasons are different. The feedback I've received is that men are expecting to be aroused either through plot, character or scenes of a blatant sexual nature. Women are generally just intrigued and then often put off by the violence - by the women - that is often apparently unmotivated. We don't really see films where women are violent without 'good' cause, it's too disturbing and dispels too many myths that potentially undermine society, supposedly. Only just over a decade ago a film, which by comparison views like Bambi, was almost not made because it depicted 'female violence'. Thelma and Louise was viewed as a rather risky production.So I'm not surprised that Baise-Moi gets a slating. It may well be all those things that the above reviewer suggests, and indeed there are elements I agree with. But this is an important film, even if you watch it just to hate it. If you do hate it, all I ask is that you really think about why you hate it. If you want CGI, predictable narrative structure, drip-feed invisible editing, and to feel absorbed and immersed (I knock none of these things), then don't bother. If you're a thinking person who has an inquiring mind, give it a go.

The directors claim this to be a movie about friendship - and that the bonds of that relationship have nothing to do with the circumstances from which they are born.  I'm somewhat sceptical about that.  If you just wanted to make a movie about friendship, it could be about nuns.  Or puppies.  Or just about anything. But Baise-moi (which translates as Shag Me, not F**k Me) serves to highlight very clearly the moral hypocrisy that surrounds cinema, and has done ever since the days of the Hayes Code.  The irony here lies in the fact that it is the explicit sex that caused the film to be banned in so many territories.  No one has a problem with the violence. Sure, the violence might be simulated, and the sex isn't - but they both occupy the same space on the screen.  And while it's legal to have sex in the privacy of your home, the violence depicted could never be legal. After all, you can see worse violence in Freddy vs. Jason, and more explicit sex on any porn video you might choose, so what is it about the combination that riles people so? I'll concede that the film is flawed, and demonstrates the debutant directors lack of experience, but for the challenge it sets to our jaded set of morals in the west, it should be applauded.

What caught my attention was the proud proclamation advising all readers that the movie, although itself French, had been Banned in France.  Upon returning home to New York, I discovered that one of the Art House movie theaters in the City was screening the film, and so (with my Finnish fiancee) decided to see what all the fuss was about.  Boy, did we ever.From the comments read here, and the reviews I knew the movie was violent and sexually explicit.  Not necessarily offended by either of these two conditions, I went with an open mind to see what had perturbed the sensibilities of our Gallic cousins.  Presumably, as anyone who is reading this will know, the story involves two women who embark on a crime and murder spree in France (the movie has English subtitles).  The resemblance to Thelma and Louise however, ends with that; the sex is unusually graphic (and in copious supply) as is the violence (a lot of stomping to death, and a lot of blood and other organic matter splattering after bullet impact).On an intellectual level, one could make the case that the film's very essence is the relationship of sex and violence (as manifested by the only sex these women know one is a small-time prostitute, and the other has earned money from time to time by performing in pornographic films.  When they, during their descent into crime and murder, have the upper hand over their sexual situations, they react only with the same violence and brutality that they themselves know and understand.  It is important to note, however, that the victims of their rampage are not only creepy men interested in creepy sex, (of which there are several)but innocent passersby, a woman at an ATM, for example, as well.I myself do not really understand why the repeated porn-movie shots were all that necessary, (except to depict the physical contact as cruel, unpassionate and debased) and the unrelenting gore did get rather tedious after the first few violent spasms.It is a coarse and crude movie, but in fairness, it is dealing with coarse and crude people and equally unpleasant circumstances.  From one point of view, the lives of the French underclasses is explored, and it's pretty grim; a travelogue for France it definitely is not- perhaps that's why the French banned it.

Is it because of the explicit sex (far more fleeting than that shown in any porno tape freely available at most corner video shops), the stylized ultra-violence or the combination of the two ? Unlike some films, this one doesn't in any way glorify violence though, it merely shows the sad inevitability of it as far as its two main characters are concerned.Both Nadine (Karen Lancaume aka Karen Bach) and Manu (Raffaella Anderson) routinely endure violation both in word and deed on an almost daily basis as sex workers, prostitute and part-time porno performer respectively. The gang rape of Manu and her drug-addicted friend shown here is totally different from the clich√©d they-may-protest-at-first type of rape scene encountered in some adults only features. While the other girl cries and screams throughout (and is ever more horribly abused because of it), Manu adopts a facade of indifferent resignation, cleverly robbing her rapists of their sadistic thrill. Rest assured that the scene goes on a lot longer than anyone would want it to and that it is very painful to watch, which is the whole point of it. When Manu and Nadine meet and embark on their violent road trip, fully aware that they ultimately can't 'get away with it', sex becomes a source of liberation to them. Like so many guys on the lam in any criminal buddy movie you can think of, they take what they want, when and how they want it, casually discarding (not always violently) their casual partners post-orgasm. One of the most common accusations at porn's address is that the explicit sex scenes dehumanize the people performing them, but here that could not be further from the truth.Former hardcore actresses Lancaume and Anderson are both terrific in their parts and the sex they have (and, yes, it is 'real' sex) enhances their characterizations, rendering them more complete. The 'cinema v√©rit√©' rawness of the digital video format in which it was shot, interrupted by sudden flashes of style when violence erupts (an artistic decision to give the viewer a feel for the power and pleasure the women derive from their acts as an escape route from their drab lives), draws the viewer uncomfortably close to the action. Again, that seems to be the point. So don't let the negative publicity fool you. BAISE-MOI is a rare film that utterly achieves what it sets out to do and it bodes well for debut cin√©astes Despentes (author of the sulfurous source novel) and ex-porn star Coralie. You may love it (as I obviously did) or you may hate it, but this is an important film that no one is likely to ever forget, no matter how hard they might try.

I love the cooking but hate the restaurants. French is one of the great languages of the world, but I find the French attitude to it xenophobic. Yet there is one thing that always stirs my passion. I admire them for it. I wish we had an ounce of it in Britain.The best known examples of course are the film protests in 1968 &#150; a time when everyone was protesting about everything. But they helped, indirectly, to restore the international prestige of French cinema. When Baise-Moi was banned shortly after release in 2000, there were spontaneous street protests. Now this is a bit different &#150; the film's artistic merits or lack of them are still a matter of debate. But I take my hats off to the French. I would love to see the British protest in the name of cinematic freedom. (The ban was eventually lifted after separate protests signed by Parisian intellectuals.)As you will already have guessed, the issues around this film are complicated. And they get worse. There is a tendency to react emotively to any highly charged sexual issues. This tendency can maybe blind us somewhat when it comes to analysing more important ones.This is a film made by women, about women living on the fringes of society. I was once importunate enough to argue with acclaimed filmmaker Gaspar No√© (after a public screening of Irreversible) that his film didn't address the issue of rape as well as Baise Moi. I still believe that, although Irreversible is a landmark film for other reasons entirely. Most films about rape follow male-orientated story lines. They often emphasise the purely physical, violence-aspect (as in Irreversible) or have a strong woman seeking and finding redress (as in The Accused). The reality is that most rape victims are traumatised mentally and emotionally. Physical hurt as a result of violence is no less an issue, but a separate one. Although The Accused looks at some of the metal trauma, it ultimately plays out as a success story. Few rape victims take on such a masculinised determination to succeed against the odds. Odds which are still stacked against the victim.What I liked about Baise-Moi is that it eschews the woman-survivor scenario for a more realistic picture of lasting psychological damage. Films that show the real horror of rape may discourage it more than ones that show women 'getting over it.' One of the victims of rape in Baise-Moi actually 'lets' her assailants get on with it, commenting to her friend afterwards that at least they didn't wind up dead. The rape (and the violence) of Baise-Moi convinced me that she probably hedged her bets wisely. Her lack of struggle didn't, in my mind, make her any the less a victim. And neither did the unpleasant fact that she was a part-time prostitute make her any more 'deserving.' This is something that it is not easy to live with. As a society, we have moved past the point where a girl in a short skirt acting flirtatiously (The Accused) is 'asking for it' or 'deserving of rape.' But where is our cut-off point? The marginals in society are often seen as dispensable. No-one wants to acknowledge them &#150; least of all mainstream filmmakers. Yet they can be just as much victims.Another thing I like about Baise-Moi is that the two girls that form a bond and go on a road trip are fully developed as characters. Like most young women, they enjoy having a good time and going after boys. But they have been mentally scarred. One of them has been brutally gang-raped and the other has watched her only friend being killed. They are not 'good girls gone bad'. They are fairly 'bad' already. But they are still victims. Beneath their bravado their mental deterioration is apparent. In Black Snake Moan, the horrific effects of a redneck woman's history of sexual abuse and rape are given some time through Christina Ricci's great acting, but the plot is driven by male characters towards a stupid and not very believable conclusion. In Baise-Moi, it is the trauma that the women went through that drives the plot. (Sadly one of the main actresses, Karen Bach committed suicide in 2005.) The film is arguably weakened by a change of style. The initial scenes are very realistic, including the horrific rape. But then the main protagonists go on a killing spree reminiscent of Natural Born Killers on trash aesthetic. Perhaps this is appropriate &#150; they live in la-la land as long as they can. But it will confuse some viewers.To reclaim women's rights over their true sexuality, to seize it back from the male gaze. It's always men who have a problem with a woman's sex that's their problem, not ours. A noble aim by the filmmakers. But will feminists baulk when they realise that one of the directors and two of the stars have previously worked in hard-core pornography? There's no logical reason why sex scenes should only be in porn, says Trinh Thi. Indeed, Hollywood agrees. I am sure there are convincing psychological arguments, but realistic sex still upsets many audiences (personally I have more of a problem with overly-realistic violence).This analysis has outstayed its welcome. I have laboured the good points of the film and rated it accordingly. On a technical level, the idea of using only natural lighting also works well. But apart from its stand against censorship and the way it deals with rape, the film is lacking in many respects. It was made on a very small budget and it shows. The acting is acceptable but not much is demanded from actors in terms of interiorisation and so on. There's a good soundtrack. But the main reason to see the film may probably be to argue over the issues it raises.

Like a skanky French Natural Born Killers but without the talent, irony or indeed entertainment, the heavy-handed symbolism and maddening acting should have you turning off after the first 40 minutes. You continue to watch however, mainly though a fascination as to how far the director is willing to push the boundaries of good taste in order to convince us of his point. Something to do with society raping people and by-products of the system, a reflection of the perversity at the root of civilisation, monkeys with guns and Girl Power.Joining the sensational release of Irreversible, with its centrepiece a nine minute rape scene, it could look to some that modern French cinema had found itself in a quandary, desperately seeking its next big theme in the rapidly thinning file of the last taboos. Thankfully, L'Homme du train dispelled those fears,at least for now. And maybe just two films don't make a wave, perhaps just a ripple.However, nothing changes the fact that when the closing credits finally arrived, I was angry. Because it was rubbish. Not a patch on the glory of La Haine which dealt with a similar rage, but with far more heart and intelligence. Baise-Moi also has the worst soundtrack ever.

This wasn't because it had particularly entranced or impressed me. The contrary, it had given me nothing at all.Why? Because somehow, everything was so much overdone that I couldn't take this film seriously anymore. There was so much sex and violence that I got the strong impression that the film was trying very, very hard to be offensive, as if it was aiming at superlatives in ugliness, rather than in telling a convincing tale about two women caught in a spiral of crime.Baise-moi had been described as Thelma & Louise with actual sex to me. Well, it is true that the main idea is similar. There are two women traveling through the country because they've committed crimes and know that their lives are finished now, that the police are going to catch them, and they decide that now that everything's over anyway, there is no way to hold back.Baise-moi had been described as a feminist film where women, who had suffered from male dominance in the past, exact revenge upon the men that they encounter.This is something that I had never interpreted into this film, simply because none of these women had ever been innocent, and because they do not just kill irresponsible, violent men, but also men that they seduce themselves, men that show the sense of wanting to do protected sex. And they kill women. No, they are in no way better than the characters that they encounter and murder in hideous, brutal ways.How easily the heroines decide to murder, and how much pleasure they take in it, made it absolutely impossible for me to relate to them in any way, or even take them seriously. It was just all too much. Too much sex, too much violence. I got the feeling that sex and violence were only there in order to create a superlative in ugliness, rather than in conveying a story, or making a point.Baise-moi left me with no impression, hadn't set me thinking, because it was so far removed from any real world. So constructed, unrealistic and over the top.There was nothing that I could do with this film, there was simply nothing about it to think about, other than Why did they make this terrible film? Had the intense unpleasantness going on in this film, served a purpose, I'd easily accepted it. But since I found nothing, since the film's story appeared to be not more than an excuse to squeeze as much and as ugly sex as possible into one film... I filed it away under unnecessary torture, decided to never ever, EVER, watch this film again, and I now consider this to be the worst film I've ever seen. Worst, not just because it really isn't my cup of tea to watch people get raped, rape, have sex in other forms and kill one another... but because whatever it was that the makers wanted to tell the world with their film... if they wanted to say anything at all... it just didn't work. And there's nothing else that could save this film, because it's also filmed in such an ugly style.

Well, the answer is No - not really.It starts well enough, nicely setting up the two main characters with some very well-acted, almost documentary-like scenes. Well, I say nicely - the word seems hardly appropriate when these scenes include Manu and another woman suffering a genuinely harrowing rape while Karen prostitutes herself, along with a liberal smattering of general sex, violence and substance abuse. Nevertheless, the opening is well-played out and directed with surprising flair (especially considering that this is the debut movie for both its directors).However, when the plot kicks in proper and the two women end up on the run together the film's interest begins to drop fast. Oddly, the further out of control the two protagonists get the less exciting the story is - it gradually becomes a mere retread of countless other low-grade revenge/exploitation movies, simply with a slightly more porno feel. By the denouement, to be brutally honest, I was bored stiff (a stiffness which is nothing to do with the pornographic element of the movie, I assure you).One of the main problems is the inherent lack of any kind of point. The beginning of the movie seems to be setting the film up as an analysis of our responses to violence - of how an upbringing in a cruel and violent environment can manifest those tendencies in ourselves - and also as a commentary on the parallels and links between violence and the act of fornication. However, it completely fails to deliver on either of these promises in the second and third acts and, increasingly, one gets the feeling the film's only reason for being is that it thinks it is cool. Unfortunately for Baise-moi, it isn't. It's a wasted opportunity. It's only real use is as a shock tactic, but even this is wasted on anyone who's seen a porn film - the violence side of it is no worse than is seen in any number of straight-to-video action/thriller flicks.Ultimately, all there is to recommend Baise-moi is a couple of impressive acting performances, a few amusing lines of dialogue and a thought-provoking 20 minutes at the start. The rest, sadly, is nothing to get excited about.

There's much worse in several critically acclaimed films that I really enjoyed - so that in itself isn't a problem for me.  What is a problem is that the film's protagonists have no reason for doing what they do - other than their graphic rape at the beginning.  If this film can be compared to 'Thelma & Louise' in any way, its that Themla and Louise were both likeable people who ended up in a bad situation they couldn't escape from.  The leads in this film are not exactly likeable at the start of the picture, let alone when they go on a killing spree murdering anyone and everyone that gets in their way.The rape sequence is very graphic - and certainly more realistic than your average Hollywood attempts.  But there is no real explanation as to why it causes the characters to lose control - it just does.  Obviously, rape is a tramuatic experience - but this film seems to just trivilise their order in an attempt to score cheap 'shock points'.The explicit nature continues with sex scene after sex scene.  Blow jobs, sex from both front and behind, standing up, lying down, on all fours - whatever your dirty favourite - chances are its in here... and seemingly for little reason other than titilation.Chances of the film being saved by feminist undertones are not taken.  Thelma and Louise took revenge on the kind of men who raped them, this women just kill whoever they feel like.  Not even 'Ms 45' killed everyone she could - only men who she had an understandable fear of following her ordeal.Certainly not a film for the faint of heart, I thought I could stomach almost anything - but watching them murder yet another person unjustly whilst having sex with yet another person who they later murder - it all became a bit too much.  I didn't so much find it shocking, as entirely boring after a while.  That the potentially enjoyable scenes were scuppered by violence seconds before they could've gotten interesting didn't help either!To conclude - I learned nothing from this film.  It's appalling direction and somewhat hammy subtitles (in English, possibly identical to the French - but I couldn't tell you for certain), as well as some dreadful acting from its leads... and worst of all - a jumpy nature that effectively ruined every murder - simply left me unable to find any merits within this picture.

The most controversial thing about this film are the sex-scenes, which are - at times - hardcore. I admire the fact the makers had the guts to film them and even let it pass in the editing room, but I have a suspicious feeling they did it just for the effect. The violence is also explicit and sometimes gory. But ladies, nouvelle violence died about seven years ago. They also discuss the fact they should say something cool whenever they kill people. But somehow they never manage to really say anything important, to make a statement. Okay, they are both on the run and one of them was raped earlier in the film, but they never give a clear motivation for the killing. Is it they want to have revenge on all the men? Well, later in the film, in a sex-club, they also kill women.If you look beside the controversy you can see that this could be a good movie, an evil Thelma and Louise, but the makers are too much focused on the sex and the violence and that makes it nothing more than an exploitation flick.

The sex is driven by the women's needs, it shows the vulnerability of men during orgasm, and the men are discarded like used tissues, if they are not killed, when the women have been satisfied.They even have a Thelma and Louise plan to die together by jumping off a cliff.

The movie made also a short run in Adult Theaters here in M√©xico City as Vi√≥lame! but I don't think it scored high. I enjoy a pretty strong stomach and, with the years passing by, I became more open-minded and tolerant (thank God something good comes also with the aging process...). The movie contains a graphic rape sequence, a few more explicit sex scenes and tons of gore and violence, without being able to deliver a message. Perhaps it was supposed to be just a provocative movie but, the violence in particular, remains almost unexplained and gratuitous and, therefore, it can only be considered pure exploitation. Graphic depiction of violence and sex in movies absolutely don't offend me (on the contrary, if well done and essential to the plot, I surely like it), but I wasn't very impressed by this one. I mostly agreed with the comment posted on IMDb so, I didn't feel any interests in posting another comment, since there was not much else I could say. However, last week, I heard on the radio, while listening to a variety program which deals with music and movies, that on January 28th, Karen Lancaume aka Karen Bach, Nadine, one of the two main characters of this movie, took her own life at age 31. A suicide news note is always a sad note but the suicide of a person who has gained certain notoriety, usually (and unfortunately) stirs-up a process of exploitation based on bad publicity and I wouldn't be surprised at all, if the movie would make another run in theaters and the sales of the DVD would benefit of an important boost. How sad! Poor exploited Karen; she surely was a pretty lady and perhaps even a fine person but, at age 31, in spite of being still a young woman, she already passed prime-time which for an Adult Movie Star (that's what she was whit 28 porn-vids and one main-stream movie, also classified as porn, in her r√©sum√©), is just about around that age. The porn industry system is allegedly very cruel and burns-up those girls, who decide to go for it, very quickly.

They say this because the film is not meant for masturbation or some other legally defining excuse. Even the filmmakers have cried out, This is not porn! in their own defense.But the thing is&#x85; this movie is totally porn. It gleefully fetishisizes violence, rape, drug use, lesbianism, domestic abuse, sodomy, robbery, gambling, blow jobs, punk-music, revenge, menstruation, patriarchal oppression, suicide and your good old fashioned non-simulated sex. Most of the time the script feels like it's just ticking off boxes on some all inclusive list of kinks. And it's all done for the money shot, baby&#x85; every time. You know why it's porn? It's porn because it shows all of those things in detailed close ups&#x85; but it has nothing to say about any of them.Directed in a classic DIY style and squarely falling into the New French Extremism movement, it was made by two-women. One a former punk turned massage-parlour hostess and the other an ex-porn star. It features two other female porn actresses mass-murdering and fornicating (imdb won't let me use the word I want to use) across France, all in trash aesthetic video and shot in available light. It's a female power fantasy. An act of sexual reclamation that reverses the conversation on gender violence and it's created by actual sex-workers. So that, in and of itself, is interesting&#x85; the actual film, however, is tedious and artificial.At times the movie does seem to show a passing interest in addressing genuine gender-war rage, but that's all thoroughly lost in its own appetite for shock imagery and its desperate need to be offensive. I've read interviews where the filmmakers claim the movie speaks to all kinds of social injustices, from class separation to racism, and I suppose those ingredients are there in the mix, but in the end this movie is really only concerned with being more pornography in a porn saturated world.Although the fact that the movie has been banned in several countries, including France, suggests that it's just the sort of artistic exercise society needs. Sadly. So there's that.If you're into camp, actual on camera sex (Raffaela Anderson is pretty hot) and you don't mind a very intense rape scene (why is the sex so real and the violence so cartoonish in this movie?), I guess it's a pretty intriguing thing to watch.

Only in hindsight have I realised how interesting it is as a testimony to human emotions diverging from the sticky norm of main stream American movies. After all we do not live in a world of perfect harmony, and cruelty, irrationality and perversion intertwines with twisted although powerful sentiments of compassion and friendship.One would be hard pressed to argue that the film is speculative in a commercial sense. It is neither compelling as a porn movie nor conceived ever to reach a large audience. On the contrary it brings across male sexuality as nihilist and deprived of emotion. A standpoint which certainly is debatable but on the other hand not necessarily destined as a comment on all male sexuality as such by the women behind the film.I frequently found myself wondering how many films attempt to portray female degradation without telling the full graphic story. Why is it that the viewer's compassion for the female is transformed into anger with the producer as soon as the male actor retracts an erected penis after half fulfilling the rape? This is no more rational than the twisted logic of the films plot.My sentiment is that this film is not provocative in the same may as other commercial pornographic action films (i.e. simply politically incorrect). By adding those few extra shots and comments that shifts the over all impression into the nihilist sphere the producer manages to come across with a film that for most viewers holds little interest simply as a porn or action film. This effect is created by showing us aspects that confuses the viewers and plays with our expectations. One could say that as far as our norms go this is matter out of place, quoting the famous words of anthropologist Margaret Mead. I actually think quite a few male spectators are upset because these women have perverted what could have been a perfectly good porn film.

Where Baise-Moi scores overCronenberg is in how the film manages to create empathy with thetwo protagonists despite the fact that they become amoral,murderous thugs. Part of this is down to the strong sourcematerial (the eponymous novel) but great credit should also go tothe two lead actresses Karen Bach and Rafaella Anderson.Anderson in particular has an air of childish impudence whichmakes you long to find some reason to excuse her violent actions.Is this movie a deconstruction of femininity in a post-feminist worldor simply a nihilistic roller coaster of an action movie?

Baise Moi, for whichever reason, was never released in Austria. I have watched it on DVD, an Italian release with a runtime of 75 minutes. I have no idea what cuts have been made but there are a lot of essential scenes missing that were in the book. I'd really like to know what the runtime of the original cut was and if some of these missing scenes have actually been shot or not, specifically, to mention just one,  the scene in the pastry shop where they shoot the toddler. Still, this is a very good movie - if you judge it per se and not in conjunction with the book. I'd probably give it higher credit had I not read the book before. Both leading ladies, Rafaella Anderson and Karen Bach, are excellent and thoroughly convincing in their roles. The music by Varou Jan really kicks. Benoit Chamillard's cinematography with ample use of steady cam takes you on a visually stunning thrill ride that leaves you catching for breath.   Coralie Trinh Thi's direction is very good, too. she lead her principal actresses (and the rest of the cast) to top performances. Still she is to blame for the movie's main shortcomings as she co-wrote the script.

In remembrance of Thriller-A Cruel Picture mixed with the plot of Thelma and Louise, this movie fails to offer any original style at all. Many women state that men can't openly watch this film and that men are closed minded to films like this. Others conclude people don't like this film because it's too explicit. Well let me be the first to say that, unlike the film makers, most human beings are intelligent people, specifically those commenting on this board(other than those that even consider this movie worthwhile). If you don't like explicit material, than most people naturally don't watch it. And if you are new to the genre, you're probably not starting with this film. Therefore we can conclude logically that most people seeing this film have experience with films by Lucio Fulci, Pier Paolo Pasolini, Gasper Noe, Alejandro Jodorosky... The difference, however between the above filmmakers and the makers of this film is that they offer intelligent, thought-out pieces that often work as metaphors of particular events. To say that this film is a metaphor of the way women feel towards a male dominated society is just ignorant.Some people say this film does not have a story, unfortunately this is not true. The film does have a story, a very simple revenge story that seemed to be written by aggrevated 8th graders. The directing in the film is insulting and it insults the other great film makers who spend long hours writing brilliant allegories and then translating through the film medium. This film, if anything, resembles that of a Troma film with explicit sex. The movie is almost laughably bad, trying to achieve a high status through publicity. The violence is, however, well done, and that does give the film some merits. But the inclusion of completely unthought sexual scenes ruins this immediately. It's not like people watching this film have not seen the act of sex before.When a movie goer goes to see a film, specifically one calling itself an art film, they expect to see fresh, thought-provoking material. What we have here is a mess. Unfortunately this movie clarifies that not everyone can make movies. Women who like this film and argue it to be revolutionary are missing the fact that there are good writer/directors out there that touch on women rights much more thoughtfully. Apparently this film is supposed to deliver some sort of message, but in order to voice such a message, you must first demonstrate a level of respectable intelligence that would allow a viewer to value the opinion of the writer/director. This film never comes close to accomplishing any level of respect and clearly the filmmakers lack any knowledge AT ALL in film-making(Other than the effects). If you're going to make a film that is controversial with a message be inventive with your film making, be inventive with your story line, be inventive with your characters, be inventive with your camera shots. DO NOT THINK THAT JUST BECAUSE YOU SHOW TWO PEOPLE REALLY HAVING SEX THAT YOUR FILM DESERVES RESPECT. The message in this film is so ineffectively delivered that I think I have scene porn films that offer more insight into life than this film.Anyways, the only reason I felt compelled to comment on this film is due to the lack of people intelligently commenting on this film as a film. Nobody wants to hear that this film is bad because of the explicit nature and nobody wants to hear it is good on that account either. The moral of the story here is, just because of a film is cutting edge doesn't make it good. Hey look at Island of Death for example, that film was banned all over the place. Or even Cannibal Ferox, which offers nothing but gore. The only problem is, those films are designed to shock and entertain through the shocks, this movie tries to offer a deep message embeded in worthless shocks, just like IOD and CF. What this film is is a PORNO made by ACTRESSES IN THE PORN INDUSTRY with BLOOD, no more, no less. Anymore analysis gives the writers too much credit in life.

The controversy surrounding the film, as well as some outraged right wing and conservative groups trying to ban the film from premiering in France, is actually more interesting than the film itself. I'm really not sure what the directors were attempting to do with the film, either making another Thelma & Louise, but on crack, or showing that pornography is actually a violence towards women, as, both the directors and the lead actresses have experienced, in the porn industry, women are often used as objects of extreme sex, violence and humiliation.Either way, the film really doesn't merit the title of a film that changed the way people thought, it was simply trying to say something about pornography and the violence that comes with it, mixed into an indie film, that was so violent and sexually explicit that it was banned in several countries and changed several censorship titles in France.If you want a better story about nihilism, a lot violence and killings, with a clear message about why they are depicted, watch Natural Born Killers, instead.

Not even so much a porn closet or drawer, just a place where things that are too horrible and perverse and maybe just personal are stored away from prying eyes. Certainly it's hard to picture many people putting this in their DVD collections right between say Bad News Bears and Batman. But it could be at least considered a real film, not entirely a porno (though there's enough to classify it such and it has been in some countries), which helps to criticize it as something other than just trash or boring masturbatory material. To be fair to the filmmakers (one a feminist and one a porn star, sounds like a joke but it isn't), it should be treated as a serious movie that would only be masturbatory to the sickest f***s this side of the bowery. That doesn't really mean it's any good though, or enlightening much on the human condition or, you know, giving a good story.If there is any story it's all knock-off, like Thelma and Louise re-written by Frank Miller on a lesser day and filmed by a kid who's just got a digital camera and has watched far too many no-budget exploitation movies. It's simply about two women (both also porn stars, which helps to explain why they go for such explicit sex scenes without question), Madine and Manu, who meet one day when one forced the other by gun point to drive her to the ocean, then the two decide to join together to do... whatever, drive, f***, kill, repeat, rinse maybe, reload, quibble, f*** and kill in bigger-numbered capacities. There's is not a very pleasant trip, nor is it entertaining, but it's hard to say if it's really boring in the way that exploitation movies can be when they are at their worst. If nothing else, it's not I Spit on Your Grave, which most of us can be thankful for.It's also shot with some kind of ugly near-yellow tint giving everything a sickened jaundiced look, and acted by porn actresses who barely know two modes to act Manu is giddy in the most sadistic way or just not giving a damn about what happens to her (rape early on) or how many people she kills (which is a lot, nearing Natural Born Killer numbers by the end I take it), while Nadine is more withdrawn, quiet, an occasional smirk but with less of a real drive to be on this pointless trip except as something to do or be. As it stands Baise-moi today doesn't contain that same shoot-you-in-the-face factor of controversy, but it's also of little philosophical or moral justification either. It's a weak statement done up with plenty of pizazz and punk, it's just gruesome enough for the unapologetic intentions it has. Baise-moi settles to be more than its contemporary women-getting-revenge-on-the-run flicks, but it doesn't settle to push any boundaries for those outside of hardcore pulp audiences.

It is been designed specifically to offend as many people as conceivably possible - its protagonists have no feminist agenda - they are women simply because the filmmakers can get away with more gratuitous sex and violence than if the protagonists were male and this way we get to see Karen Bach posing with guns in her underwear.I put a spoiler alert just to be on the safe side but theres really no point in a synopsis. One girl gets raped (she doesnt mind too much - I can't recall another film where a rape victim shrugs off the attack in the same way and its another example of the reckless disregard of the filmmakers and I bet that p**sed off loads of people) the other is a prostitute at the beck and call of some junkie loser (who looks a little bit like Gary Oldman but isn't) for reasons which aren't defined.  They both kill someone in anger and meet up by chance at the local train station after the last train has left. They kill a woman for her cashpoint card despite only seconds earlier one of the characters saying she has 10,000F to spend (told you it doesnt make any sense) I could go on but won't - watch it and decide for yourself, its only on 77 minutes.And finally - clear up some of the misinformation from earlier comments1. The directors were both women - the screenplay was based on one of the director's novels.2. Manu clearly states that the rape didn't bother her and the reasons why - she snaps because her brother gets angry not because she's been hurt but because his territory has been invaded - uncomfortably probably a typical male response.

After separately committing murders, two French women join together in a spree of crime and sex. Because both have endured abuse at the hands of men, the movie seems to start as a self-righteous parable--but the women's actions quickly degenerate into amoral, near random killings, with women shot as casually as men. One reviewer described Baise-Moi as Thelma & Louise with actual penetration, but it's actually Thelma & Louise without Hollywood sentiment. By refusing to condemn or justify the protagonists' actions, and by depicting both sex and violence with unglamorous realism, Baise-Moi forces the viewer to respond in the most contradictory and basic ways. You may find the lead characters surprisingly sympathetic. Jarring, unsettling, and well worth watching.

Of course, I think it is quite brilliant certainly innovative and also very disconcerting. There is violence, sex and generally quite a lot happening, but still the movie refuses to tell any story, teach any morals, elicit compassion, subscribe to any ideology, it doesn't even wish to entertain.What I want to comment on is the advertising line banned in France. This is not entirely correct in its simplicity. France is both more liberal and more bigoted than that. Everything started very well the movie was reviewed by the relevant commission and issued with a certificate 16 by the ministry of culture, Catherine Tasca at that time.  16 is the most grown-up category in France, with the liberal philosophy behind it that you don't need to be 18 to watch something more serious than Disney. The movie was accordingly scheduled by the major cinema circuits. However a few days before the first public showing a private association called Promouvoir, which combines fundamentalist Catholicism with hard-core fascism, brought a complaint against the ministry at the Conseil d'√âtat - a quaint institution, something a little bit like a constitutional court. For once the court acted very quickly and just a few days after the movie had come to the screens - without any public notice as befits an art movie and to modest critical acclaim - it ruled that the movie was probably of pornographic nature. The fascists (Bruno M√©gret and Promouvoir) were right and the ministry was wrong. The certification had to be revoked.What now? Some cinema owners representing the liberal France continued to show the movie for some more days, despite the threat of horrendous fines, which gave most people who wanted to watch it a chance to do so. I watched it on the afternoon after the court ruling in an only half full cinema. We can't really say therefore that the eager masses were deprived.But then? There is no 18 certificate in France, the only thing the producer could have done theoretically would have been to apply for an X (porno) certification. A pointless exercise, because normal cinemas are not allowed to show X movies (all a question of taxes and subsidies) and the porn cinema of Paris - despite all the city of love' stuff  there is only one left - well, Baise- moi isn't really for their audience, is it?So Baise-moi was not theoretically banned - the producer would just have needed to apply for that famous X certificate - but given that it was not allowed to be shown with an 16 certificate and that X movies cannot be shown at all because there are no X cinemas, the movie was practically banned.And the end of the story? Well of course Catherine Tasca promised to recreate the 18 certificate, abolished for liberal reasons in the first instance. Just for borderline cases like Baise moi, of course. And acting on this promise the last big cinema circuit, MK2, took the movie off the screens. Well, that was a year ago and France is still waiting for the re-release of Baise-moi on the big screen.

What I discovered, was that the most memorable thing about Baise-Moi, was not its graphic sex or violence (and there's plenty), but rather this strange meloncholy, intentional or not, that drenches every frame of the picture. Every character in the Baise-Moi is flawed; either they are abusive or they are abused, victims or victimizers, and it's really in the throw-away scenes, like when a drug dealing acquaintance of one of the main characters is savagely beaten in an alleyway, that Baise-Moi is most effective, reminding us of the environment that prompted these women to do what they did.Although the filmmakers have mentioned in interviews that they were just trying to make an exploitation film and had to pull off the intellectual stuff after being threatened with an X rating, it's clear that both women, one of whom has worked in pornography, possess an anger that burns so deep within them that they can't seem to acknowledge it themselves.Ironically, there's even a scene in the film where the two anti-heroes murder a bourgois psychologist for suggesting that they must have been hurt really bad to do what they do. Well, the fact is, they have been hurt, whether they want to admit it or not. A lot of Baise Moi's energy emerges from this crucial point. The only thing that I didn't like about Baise-Moi was that the main characters were women. Although it's widely accepted that it's daring to show women as victimizers, I felt that this device was a bit of a smoke screen. If men were put in the exact same position, (a la I Stand Alone) the film would have been fifteen times more disturbing because it would have been, utterly, utterly senseless, almost to the point of indulgence (see Pasolini's Salo.). The fact that the characters are women, redeem Baise-Moi somewhat, because it's bridging cinematic ground and playing with stereotypes. This sensibility allows Baise Moi's audience to forgive the women a little more than they should.Certainly, Baise-Moi isn't for everyone, but it is a strong reminder that in this world, a little bit of compassion or self-worth goes a long, long way. Ultimately, like Heneke's The Seventh Continent or Gaspar Noe's  Seul Contre Nous, it really ends up asking more questions than it's prepared to answer, but in the end, it's a better film for doing so.

satisfaction...her friend reacts in a way that may be considered typical... she cries, she is beaten (her reaction excites her attackers, although it is not acceptable to say she justifies their actions), she feels shame and violation... she even transfers guilt to her friend, because of manu's blank reaction... this illustrates, to me anyway, the condemnation of women by some fellow

the standard porno action unfolds, but slipped in are shots of nadine looking at the television, showing a sausage being sliced... at the end of scene, her client's face is shown, not the standard money shot... once again the movie uses sex to say some things about porn, and male fragility...in a fit of rage, nadine murders her flatmate... many would say this is unforgivable, and it is an immoral and terrible act... however, one does understand that she has lived through much assumption and moral grandstanding... her fury makes sense in the movie's context...nadine and manu meet and bond in a strange dancing scene... one gets the feeling of girls, not battered women... this moment has been called superfluous, but i disagree... instead of ending in lesbian orgy, it is the only expression of innocence...after manu and nadine kill a random woman for money, all audience sympathy is lost... manu and nadine are baptised in sin... they are locusts, and dispense death or pleasure with indifference...nadine and manu also demonstrate female domination and abuse towards what is perceived as a weak man... they encounter the perennial object of some female scorn, a man who is not

(not the majority, but some) women are on display here too...finally they exact a bloody, violent retribution in a sex club, against those who feel excess is a mark of coolness... are these people excited by sex, or by the idea that engaging in unconventional practices makes them somehow special?... manu and nadine seem comfortable with the idea that sex is what it is, and they find the people in the club to be repugnant posers... i never felt like men were on trial on this movie, just attitudes and violence as a whole were being put on display...this is not an easy movie to swallow... i do

No doubt, there are plenty of people out there who automatically equate 'foreign language' with 'art' (and dually equate 'Hollywood' with 'trash'), who managed to convince themselves that this film is making some sort of sociological or philosophical point, or something. Perhaps even the filmmakers believed that they were making a 'real movie,' although judging from their backgrounds, I have my doubts. In fact, the filmmakers were smart in the sense that, being devoid of any actual talent, they decided to gain their film publicity in the easiest possible way - after all, it doesn't take much effort or creativity to have sex on camera. And this sort of material generates controversy without even trying, and as they say, no publicity is bad publicity. The problem is not the level of sex or violence on display here. It's not even the dire storyline - which plays like Thelma and Louise minus all positive qualities, but with a hefty serving of reverse misogyny thrown in to compensate. It's simply the sheer ineptitude on display during the entirety of its running time (though admittedly its only saving grace - and I use the term lightly - is its reasonably short duration). The script was a non-starter to begin with, and is not redeemed by either the performances or the production values. Of particular note are some embarrassingly awful special effects (the rule of thumb as far as I'm concerned if you don't have the money to do it properly, don't); and some unintentionally hilarious 'cool' scenes with the girls wielding a gun in each hand, in slow-motion, John Woo style.If you want to see some controversial foreign films that are also good - there are plenty of options available, such as Battle Royale or Irr√©versible.

A quick answer NO - don't bother.This film contains explicit sexual violence. The scene which really created all the controversy was a rape scene that shows the intercourse in the same...... 'detail' that you would get in an x-rated porn film. From a cinematic point of view, the rape scene invariably creates a feeling which is a mixture of hollowness and horror. Unless you are completely depraved, I doubt you will regard this scene as stimulating or a turn on if you get my drift.Beyond this controversial start, there's nothing much there. The story is weak - kinda Thelma and Louise type thing - but delivers no dramatic punches. Instead, there are simply periodic spouts of sexual violence, humiliation and depravity to make up for drab story and absence of character insight. That said, there is one hilarious scene where a guy gets a bullet in his butt!!! This does give the film the shock value it seeks, but strip it back to its bare bones and disregard the overt sexual violence and there's really nothing much worthy left to speak over - story, plot devices, character development, etc... all missing or minimal.All in all, don't bother. Even the 'shocking' aspects of this film do little to actually improve my opinion of it. It's almost like a horror, in that the story is meaningless or pathetic and characters are either type-cast or undeveloped; but it doesn't matter because all you're really seeing the film for is the intermittent gross-out!To those who feel that this film is actually worthy of praise or analysis, get a hair cut and get a real job.

It's not really. There is a lot of anger there about sex and power. Certainly it's interesting that this downright nasty film about sex and violence is made mostly by women from the porn industry but using the aesthetics of porn. In an interview Anderson recounts asking Despentes if she was her whore now to which the director responded that she could always go and work in a call center if she didn't like it. So I guess that is telling as Despentes criticizes sexual violence and yet abuses her actresses in the same way and actually has apart from a very nasty rape scene scenes in there with might just as well be mainstream porn. Story? Two promiscuous women with different attitudes towards violence and bitter experiences (one is a victim, the other rather a perpetrator herself) team up screwing and killing any man they come across. The violence is mindless and gratuitous, the sex graphic and sometimes vile. The acting is actually pretty good, particularly Bach who plays a character for whom violence is an escape from her boredom. To some point I can see a statement there about the kind of violence women experience in sexual relationships but that's about all there is. A lot of scenes in this film are just disgusting and nasty. The scenes that are well put together are actually all stolen from Michael Winner's 1993 film Dirty Weekend (Bach in lingerie playing with a gun for example). Are the two women supposed to be victims? We may never care. I read the book afterwards to see if I had missed anything- no there is just no substance there.

First of all it's not a protest against exploitation, it IS exploitation. Second the movie lacks all kinds of production values. Rather it looks like what it is, like cheap porn. The violence is explicit and unnecessary. The plot is a joke and the acting bad beyond words.

It contributes nothing to the development of the media and it's most of all just boring and silly to watch. If i want to watch people have sex there is porn available. And if a movie has something to say, it's always managed to say that without using full frontal nudity and explicit sex scenes before. Are directors so depraved of inspiration that they have to use cheap shock-effects like explicit sex-scenes?

Okay, this could be an appealing combination for many audiences but what really strikes you about Baise Moi is its utter ineptitude and ugliness.Directed by two women; Virginie Despentes and Coralie Trinh Thi (based on ex-prostitute Despente's novel), the film does evoke a substantial feel of female rage and bitterness towards men, although having the two leads kill innocents does leave a nasty taste in the mouth and detracts from the film's message. The director's have tried hard to make a shocking and provocative film here, but the use of hardcore acts merely as a distraction from what is trying to be said. Men will see this film because of the sex, not because of any feminist issues that may arise through the narrative. But maybe that's the whole point of Baise Moi - to feed men's weakness for sex whilst simultaneously castrating them with images of mutilation and death. I'm sure Freud would have had a field day with it, but he probably would have had better things to do.Porn stars Raffaela Anderson and Karen Bach act to the best of their ability, pulling off (excuse the pun) some of the more emotional scenes satisfactorily, but you just can't help thinking that they are just playing at being 'proper' actresses. But it is also this element of amateurism that gives the film a well-needed dose of charm, something it is severely lacking. For all its good intentions and bravery, Baise Moi manages to alienate the viewer with its slap-dash style and repulsive characters whilst also being just brave enough to earn itself a few merit points.With all the controversy that surrounds it, Baise Moi does indeed live up to its shocking nature. There is a close-up penetration shot during the opening rape scene (cut from UK prints), several blow jobs, a gun being inserted in a man's arse and fired and hardcore sex aplenty, but most shocking of all is the fact that a film so poorly made has been merited as such a classic in some quarters. Okay, so it's 'cutting edge' to incorporate sexual penetration into a mainstream film, but Baise Moi is about as mainstream as your holiday videos, and shot on the same format. Stick with Thelma and Louise - if you also want hardcore sex - go and get some, the two don't mix.

As far as I could see, the extreme content has no sub-text or hidden message; it is simply there for the purpose of entertaining viewers who like to watch films that push the boundaries. Some people may have a problem with this kind of entertainment, and if so, they should stay well away.

(Altohugh it does have distinctly adult moments, with a rather alarming regularity.) This is one of those rare films which courts sensationalism, and mines it for all the perverse pleasure our characters take from being as far removed from humanity as is possible to depict. Like A Clockwork Orange, Baise Moi is rather uncomfortable watching, although I can't help thinking a less explicit version could still have told the same story, and, in so doing, doubtless have attracted a far wider audience, and may not be wreathed in notoriety. Because a lot of the most successful moments in this disturbing thrill ride, are those when the power of suggestion is at its' strongest. Violence is depicted with the usual blood and thunder, but there is definitely a conscious attempt to mask some of the more extreme moments - such as our protagonists delightfully stomping, droog style, a man to death after he has suffered a particularly unpleasant and humiliating fate.The point here, is that this is indeed a very graphic film, but if the same effort had been made to mask the sex in this movie, that is made for the violence, the whole thing may have been more palatable. As it is, it's difficult to sincerely recommend this movie to someone else, because it's little short of pornography in places. This, it seems to be, need not have been the case. Spring Breakers, by Harmony Korine, deals with a similar subject - disaffected, over-sexualised, bored girls going on a voyage of pointless, emotionless violence - but is far more successful because it knows exactly what it is doing, and is careful in its' depiction of both sex and violence, and is a truly scary movie. Instead, Baise-Moi is a frustrating experience, because, not only is its' depiction of sex rather striking, it is also rather unnecessary in the telling of this story, especially in its' rather single-minded obsession with oral sex. This rather makes our protagonists seem a lot less believable, because there is little empowering about this particular practise. Instead, the violence is shocking, and powerful, and the sex just seems like someone felt the need to put as much sex as possible in the movie to get it to sell. Which it doesn't need, because parts of this movie shine in unique ways.At its' best, this movie seems to recall La Haine, five years previously, and far better constructed, in its' depiction of ennui amongst seedy, borderline criminal cases. Nadine and Manu drift around in a truly horrific world, in which things have become so bad, that they have all but lost their grip on reality. The subsequent road trip which they go on, is as each for purpose, for glamour, and for kicks. In a particularly harrowing scene, Nadine even finds that rape has lost its' power to shock her.The relationship between Nadine and Manu is tender, and fresh They hang about lethargically, debating the life they are undertaking, before exploding into a fresh act of violence. NAdine discusses their lack of good lines during their kills, in a rather postmodern sequence which is at once chilling, funny and mesmerising. Both girls give stunningly good performances, and their friendship seems so realistic, yet strange, that it helps carry us through about twenty minutes of solid sex scenes. A more established director would have devoted far more time to their relationship, because, when they are together, these two really, really shine, but instead, they are given a few scenes together, and largely are relegated to standard interactions with other infinitely less interesting characters. The sudden frazzling out of their desires is disappointing, yet totally in character These are two characters who, from the first time we meet htem, are combating suicidal urges, from sheer boredom, and their clinical discussions about how they are going to go out big are again stunning and clever.The climax is rather unsatisfying, in that it delivers a decidedly unremarkable ending to a unique story. It does little to really address the realities of these characters, instead providing a simple closure on the lives of these fictional characters. Which is a shame, as the film has courted allegory from start to finish, and raised some dangerous points. Its' rather a chapter 21 case (Clockwork Orange reference), of closure for closure's sake. But ultimately, although frustrating in its' pandering to lower common denominators, this is a vivid film in that it is morally complex in its black-for -white world view. It is still powerful, altohugh its' power to shock is rather muted by its' tendency towards stylised sexual violence. Disappointing, and tricky to watch more than once, but still a valuable movie in its' depiction of a genuine human evil.

Hopefully you know what to expect at least!BM is somewhat like 'Henry Portrait of a Serial Killer', but with a pair of seemingly psychologically 'normal' women, who one day lose it and commit murder on impulse, happen to bump into one another before going postal for a few days before it all unravels tragically at the end.What BM offers that most 'extreme' films don't, is a large proportion of the cast and directors being from the pornographic industry, and of course, actual unsimulated sex scenes. That and the the fact that women are ones committing reckless acts of murder, often in brutal and creative ways, with the sex and the violence interspersed evenly and casually throughout, does serve to earn the film its controversial reputation.A common criticism is the loose storytelling, and yes, the first few scenes are unusual, and very random, snippets of street/bar scenes, conversations, yet all tinged with a sense of menace. Tension between man and woman is palpable from early on, before any of the characters are properly introduced.The first lead is Nadine, a lady of the night, played by the stunning (and sadly departed) Karen Lancaume, demure and polite in public, super casual at home, where she constantly fends off her bickering housemate. The second is Manu (Rafaella Anderson), younger and gutsier, and actually more believable as a killer or a criminal than Nadine.The manner of their meeting and subsequent bonding is somewhat rushed and artificial. Probably not what the directors wanted to focus on, in preference for getting to the action as soon as possible.The violence will satisfy most extremophiles, it is more of the gritty and realistic variety than the cartoonish gore Kill Bill variety. However, I never truly bought Nadine as a sadistic killer the way I did with Manu. Manu just seems like a dangerous street kid capable of anything, with Nadine it feels she is more just coming along for the ride, and is too jaded about life to care or take much pleasure in the brutality. Her speaking and mannerisms are too sedate and measured, even aloof; I am thinking her first mainstream role should not have been as radical as this. BM finishes with Manu killed, and Nadine forced to deal with her loss, whom she mourns as she would a sister (after only having met her a few days prior). So, not even after so much carnage does she lose her ability to feel, or love, she is finally presented as a tragic character, not a monster. And perhaps, after being used to seeing psychopaths commit these acts on our screens, Nadine's 'human' story adds to BM being so hard to stomach for the censors, given the monstrous acts she previously committed.I know of no other film as violent with frequent unsimulated sex scenes, especially not ones where the murderers and participants in said sex scenes are one and the same! Given that the film is now 13 years old, in the world of extreme, that has to count for something!

The basic story &#x96; two rape-victims go on a revenge-rampage &#x96; is simple, without much depth and the hardcore scenes seem randomly thrown in, for the sake of effect and scandal, rather than helping the films progress.Antagonists Karen Bach and Raffaela Anderson definitely both can't live up to the skills of Geena Davis or Susan Sarandon; at no time able to disguise what they in reality are porn-actresses. Same goes for the rest of the cast crew, who cannot deny the genre they've originated from (and, without doubt, will return to after this excursion into real film). I dare say that, in the times before straight-to-video (now internet) porn, there have been porn-productions, like the Josefina Mutzenbacher-films, that featured better actors and more solid story lines.It's unlikely that fans of feminist revenge-thrillers will be very interested in a film containing un-simulated sex scenes; for jaded gorehounds there is too little of that and people who're into cheap porn, well, those will know where to find that on the world wide web (or will forward during the cheap dialog and action scenes).

This is the instigator for a murderous spree of men, who they first pick up and have sex with, one near the end who they rob, gets it right in the buttock, anal entry plus. This is just a movie to be shocked and get off on. It was an indulging view when I saw it back in 2002, before it's banning. It's end, I found distasteful, the way one of the woman victims was spoken to by the law. This could be an anti rape movie or one demonstrative of women's rights. You be the judge. Not for the easily offended. "},{"Title":"Good movie.  Some problems, and NOT for everyone!","Date":"6 December 2011","Score":"","Genre":"Crime, Drama, Thriller","Review":" I finally sat down to watch this movie. I was expecting just a mess of a film. However, I was greatly surprised by it. It is definitely not for everyone. It relies on Abel Ferrera for its story, no doubt. What struck me was the gritty portrayal of a France that is usually unseen (albeit a fictionalized one) in French cinema. It is not the lighthearted Amelie or others of the ilk. No one is really likable. French society is not ideal. The two leads are not professional (except in the porn business), and their acting shows that, but their characters are not supposed to have any more depth than they do. Many of the victims are sleazy, and I, as a viewer, do not know whether to root for the antiheroes or not. That is the directors' strength in the movie, and precisely their point. These women are empowered feminists (as is one of the directors) and show their anger at not only men, but the industry that creates a male-dominated and desexualizes women in a male-oriented way. Just look at how the female victim at the ATM looks! Look at how the women at the sex club are enjoying themselves! Look at how the men force the women into pleasing them or how they attempt to control them from doing what they want to do to feel pleasure (whether it is sexual or, in the case of the protagonists, killing). This movie is a critique on society. The two women had enough and, like Michael Douglas in Falling Down, go on a cross-country killing spree just for a release from reality and to control it at the same time. There are many hardcore sex acts, and the film is not in the same vein as Cafe Flesh, but, like that film, it swerves from sex acts to a normal storyline. Again, NOT for everyone, so don't go out and rush to rent. I wish it were a bit better with acting and film stock, but it's hardly worth the 4.4 that IMDb shows it having! I give it 7 of 10. E.

Now I will try to be objective. This is NOT a revenge movie. Anyone calling it that has not seen it. True, one of the women has been raped, but she doesn't seem to care, nor does she want revenge. The other woman who joins her simply wants excitement. If you have to compare this to an American film, try Natural Born Killers. That is closer in tone and theme than Thelma & Louise because there is nothing to like about these characters. They are cold-blooded, merciless killers who go on a rampage and enjoy murdering and having sex. Sometimes they kill the people they have sex with; other times they don't. But the bottom line is that this is truly bad filmmaking. It looks like something made by a pair of high school dropouts with no idea what the point of their film is. It is shot on video (not film), features adult film actresses, unrealistic violence, and has no impact. About half-way through, you may ask yourself why it was made. It really goes nowhere. Even if was a revenge film, it still wouldn't have been any good, because of the poor acting, poor production value and the fact that the first-time directors just haven't sharpened their talent yet. Who is the target audience for this? A porno audience? The horror film audience? It doesn't hit the mark in either genre. Who cares about the explicit sex and violence if it's so poorly made that you can't take it seriously? That is definitely the case with Baise-moi. "}{"Title":"A poor film, but not because it shows sex and violence","Date":"27 July 2011","Score":"","Genre":"Crime, Drama, Thriller","Review":" Let me start of by saying that Sex and violence and the relationship between them are integral to the human experience and are both older than history itself, and I'm more than prepared to watch a film that engages in those themes. Baise-Moi does try to explore those ideas, but it falls far short of that task for a number of reasons 1) The Characters The two leads of the film, Nadine and Manu to their credit aren't badly performed at all. I was able to see a relationship that transcended that of a sexual nature and was filled with a genuine affection - you can see that once they had become bonded they almost became a single entity, functioning as two parts of one whole never in conflict with each other but with the world around them.The problem is that the characters lose sympathy from the audience through their actions, and It's not because they commit horrendous acts of violence or engage in sexual activity with strangers. It is possible to see characters do such things and still root for them - one need only consider characters such as Tony Soprano to accept that. But the actions of Nadine and Manu seem arbitrary. They'll have sex with some people, and kill others and its rarely clear why. In fact towards the end of the film the enter a sex club and massacre an entire room of people who are exploring and engaging in sex in a consensual manner even though these people are doing exactly what Nadine and Manu have spent their time doing. I struggled to understand what their ideology was - there didn't seem to be any clear rules or logic that could be applied to what they were doing. As an audience we don't always have to sympathize with a character, but if we can't empathize with them then their choices end up being unbelievable and we lose all stake in the film.2) The Plot. The main problem with the plot is that the film doesn't really have one and it lacks proper structure. We have a first act where we are introduced to the main characters and witness their first meeting and a end goal is set up - that of meeting another character in Vosges to help them in some kind of border smuggling enterprise, the details of which are never really made clear. Thus we enter the second act and are given the impression that this is to be a road film - a journey into the darkest corners of human interaction where all inhibitions are banished as the character's race, almost eagerly towards self destruction.We do see Nadine and Manu engage in sex and murder in an almost decadent fashion, and we see them reflect on the nature of their partnership. But there is no sense of a journey here. The films goes from one scene to another with no sense of progression. The characters seem relatively unchanged from their first act of murder and it doesn't feel as if they are really physically journeying anywhere either. It almost feels as if they're just driving around randomly - there is no sense of an overall plot progression here at all. Characters are randomly introduced and dispatched without forwarding the overall plot in any real sense.3) The Cinematography I don't know a lot about camera work or cinematography so I won't go on about it at length but from a lay-man's point of view it felt pretty weak. Obviously this is a low budget film that had to make do with what could be afforded and I totally accept that. But the camera work constantly felt to me as if it was neglecting to play to the strengths of being able to use a hand-held camera to get a sense of realism. It always felt like the director was trying to use the camera as if it was a big budget high quality one. Unfortunately the low quality nature of the shots makes the film feel like a pale amateur imitator of other films. To sum up then, the reason Baise-Moi fails as a film for me isn't the explicit or shocking nature of the film. The makers of this film clearly decided that they wanted to be unflinching in their examination of the darker recesses of human society and I see that as a legitimate attempt to create a piece of art. Also the acting, while not award winning is for the most part isn't at all terrible and the two leads carry the film well as much as is possible. The problem lies ultimately with the script - which lacks a coherent 3 act structure. It feels as if the writer started out trying to set up a story-line with a first act that introduces the main characters and gives them an end goal and sets up a story about a journey. But then just got bored and decided to craft a series of scenes that pay homage to other road films that explore sex and violence, but failed to understand what made those films work. The end result comes off as amateurish and hackneyed and makes it look as if the film was made purely for shock value rather than to explore explicit themes in an unflinching manner.Ultimately the films attempts to explore sex and violence in an explicit manner but fails as a piece of art. In doing so it hands those who would try to censor artful expression an example that furthers their goal rather than contradicts it. 3/10.

I had read several reviews of this film where viewers were disgusted etc, yet I was merely bored. It started off good enough with a promise of some edgy drama. The rape scene was violent but not over the top so I was expecting something good; instead it just drifted into aimless sex. Really seeing oral sex, naked ladies and groaning doesn't shock me - but it doesn't make for a good film, either. There is a scene where one of the ladies menstruates into a bath, which I guess was meant to shock, but being female, periods really don't offend me. I found that scene pointless and purely aimed at scaring male viewers. The ending was very lame and very predictable.

In movies it usually comes down to sex and violence with pretensions. It's hard to know which was more laughable, the pretensions of the film makers (I believe they think really this is art) or the outraged response of respectable film critics. At base Baise-Moi is exploitation (and very base indeed). As that it actually works brilliantly. Filmed with anarchic enthusiasm - code for amateurism - this harks back to such (non) classics as I Spit On Your Grave. The sex is real but yet oddly false in that porn movie way. The violence is done very badly and looks ridiculous. Why non-simulated sex and phony looking violence is more offensive than the Hollywood formula of phony sex and real looking violence is beyond me. Detractors will point to the nihilism of the piece, but when did Pulp Fiction or Kill Bill offer anything else (Oh I forgot - clever dialogue excuses everything). Acting is as you would expect from porn actresses, but oddly they seem to have more fun than the mannered gurning that passes for great acting in so many films (think D Day-Lewis in There Will Be Blood). Despite it all, taken as a video nasty this is fine, taken as art it is the most stupid film since Walerian Borowczyk's La Bete, as an indicator of the hypocrisy of film critics it approaches genius.

The two ladies end up becoming quite psychotic as their morals go down the drain as they become addicted to their downward spiral of depravity.This film asks some important questions of society and how people end up going insane due to nasty things happening to them and it does not make you feel sympathy for the characters.The plot is nothing new but the realism in the way it's shown might be too disturbing for some viewers.

Fair enough. I grabbed Baise-Moi and the tepid if enjoyable, Last Kiss.Let's stay with this pairing. First of all &#133; Comes the premise, 'literature must be larger than life.' So said some dude that my English Prof quoted. I was quick to point out that Steinbeck's works were equal to, or perhaps smaller than life. Anyway, my point Last Kiss is an example of reality being skewed by whatever filter fiction is supposed to place in front of real life whereas Baise-Moi for all its faults and critics, is in some way 'real life,' and as such is worth watching, or &#150; 'worth the ride,' to quote an Ontario, Canada review. Two slutty French women on the fringes of a supposedly non-employing French society are violently raped. Ultimately, the duo goes on a murderous binge of high-octane sex and violent revenge. One dies, the other is going to get life in the slam.These women, true, are far from paragons, but their compassion is evidenced when one risks her neck to try and save a young French Immigrant from a fearful beating. The same girl says to a junkie bartender-friend, that men like him are only satisfied, only 'fully alive' she mocks, when they are hitting someone. Both the comment and the compassionate have been are overlooked, in most reviews. Pity. That the two, post traumatic rape are completely transformed by this event is either overlooked, or rape is dismissed in negative reviews as too inconsequential to justify the ensuing killing spree. Excuse me! How's that? Two young women have just been raped in the most brutal fashion imaginable and it's not possible that they would go on to kill ten or so people, (even if some are women)? There's no possible 1-to-1 correlation? Nah &#150; just as fired post office officials and picked-on high school nerds never react violently. Never happens. Impossible &#150; Run this crap out of town at the end of a bayonet. OF COURSE THERE'S A CORRELATION!As the two gals cast as the victims are themselves, well-known porn stars, it must be said that the sexual emphasis is (duh) almost exclusively on female pleasure. And that the sex is very hot. ( I don't watch porn and was pretty tired when I slapped this puppy in; it fairly arrested my attention.) I notice that even the film's most vehement critics concede that the sex scenes are powerful. The reason I don't watch porn is because what I've seen is boring &#150; this sex is not. Clich√©d or otherwise; could this be the reason the film's detractors seem to be mostly male? While it is nonsense to suggest that women aren't often in control bedrooms across the world, it seems as if male film critics &#150; as opposed to males generally, don't dig that? Such is life. As Baise-Moi is so short and so deliberately obvious, let me quickly address the downside and spend a bit more on the good and then you film lover, you must be the judge, jury and executioner.I don't like the look of many of the scenes especially the night scenes; whatever digital rig was used just isn't up to it. I also felt that there was a glaring and not always favorable contrast between the dramatic skills of the protagonists, those of; Mme. Karen Lancaume were so far ahead of Mme. Raffa√´la Anderson's, that at times, the latter is purely superfluous. I do agree emphatically with whatever review said that just because the actresses in Baise-Moi don't emote a great deal, (other than murdering and crazed sex, of course) that doesn't equal bad acting. The acting is of a good standard, however, Raffaela Anderson's acting did on several occasions fall on the wrong side of 'natural,' and into the realm of 'apparently very limited.' (Or, untrained, more charitably.) Finally the end was a bit of bust, as I am still not sure that Anderson was saved from suicide by a last possible moment arrest by the gendarmes. I really disliked the fact that while the sex was unbridled, the violence was the toned-down at points, almost to the bloodless levels of Pulp Fiction, which simply doesn't work in this thing. If the intention is to show what some women really want from sex, then in such a vehicle, the monstrous nature of most REAL violence, (I once had a County Coroner for a room mate and I can confirm that in its awfulness real violent death is probably beyond worst imaginings) we need the real deal.What I did like about the film was the nausea, the stink, the fear that only reality can connote. I also found (duh!) the brutal rape quite sufficient to both, launch such a revenge, as well as become the pretext by which losers like these could lose all moral grip. It was also a clever, if obvious touch to show Lancaume trying to stop the beating of an innocent as it 'proves' that, prior to being raped she was a different person. (Folks, from far flimsier grounds was the film industry born and sustained; I mean come on &#150; spare me the mock horrifics, and idiotic, 'unmotivated killing spree,' jazz. Brutal rape is motivation enough.)I liked the depiction of the seedy but undeniably exciting pick-ups beloved of the French. I mean, picking up random strangers to party &#150; and then some - is the French Character, and the movie has xeroxed that character. I loved much of Kern Lancaume's acting- whatever grand critics might have of it. I liked the soundtrack. I liked what I saw as the film's occasional humor; surely the makers of Baise-Moi knew that revenge murder in a 'F**k Club' was going to yes, sound both funny and fishy and I think that strong humorous intent was at play. I mean the proprietor (shortly before being gunned down) said, 'this is a f**k club not a mosque' and it was funny.Finally, however, while it is doubtful that Baise-Moi will ever be what most general audiences pine for, it's unflinching depiction of death, particularly in the final scene was arresting. (Though I wish, in light of their respective skills, the scene was reversed and Ms. Lancaume and not Ms. Anderson honored the other by attempting suicide.) Say what you will about this film, or about the justness of Anderson being forced to end her life in return for innocents slaughtered, this final scene has an incredible, fearsome power. I was recently mis-diagnosed with a potentially fatal illness and Anderson's final stock taking, the resignation to death, a waste of life and the eternal nature of death, was very powerful &#150; and trust me, realistic. &#133; Above all the sadness that follows resignation to &#150; for better or worse &#150; the final fear that haunts us all. Which curiously, is probably this film's raison d'etre.

This is without doubt the most sexually explicit and graphically violent mainstream film I have ever seen in my life.With sex scenes on par with your real hardcore porn movies, featuring penetrative sex, mouth to genital contact and ejaculation images and violence so bloody as to be disturbing and sickening, I have to question the purpose of this film from beginning to end.Don't get me wrong I enjoyed the film very much and it was well acted throughout, but I can't help but feel that the boundaries were extended a tad too much. Some might call it gritty realism which indeed it is, but others may argue with equal justification that this is nothing more than gratuitous sex and violence for gratuitous sex and violence sake in order to shock and appall to purposely course the controversy surrounding it in an effort to boost it's ratings.I am not a prude, and enjoy erotica as much as the next person, but when you are faced with a rape scene so harrowing and disturbing you start to feel that your almost watching some sort of snuff movie.Although the sex scenes are the factor which stand out most the violence plays a key role although it is not explained fully why they decide to commit such senseless acts of murder.As far as I could make out, they did it purely for kicks and thoroughly enjoyed it too. Again violence for violence sake.Many people have likened this film to a sort of Thelma and Louise gone bad, but it is directed in such a way that apart from the two main characters and their circumstances the comparisons end.In Thelma and Louise, you sympathize with them and end up rooting them on and you overlook their crimes because you know they are really good people at heart. With this film however, their perversity and love of killing fails in every way to get me on their side and I spent most of the movie looking forward to the day these two homicidal maniacs are caught and punished.There have been many films depicting murder and rape. In the days of the Hayes office, rape only had to be suggested to have got the message across. Did we really have to be subjected to that nightmare inducing depravity to convince us of what was going on? I think not.All they have done is to turn our attentions away from what is at heart a very good story. In years to come people are not going to remember Baise-moi as a true life saga with a riveting plot, they will remember it solely as a controversial exploitation of excessively pornographic smut.

But that doesn't mean attendance at this particular viewing was high.  On the contrary, for the only time ever the author noted that the exact demographic of single 50+ year old men (perhaps six of us) was in attendance.  Spaced twenty or so seats apart, it is to be presumed we preferred to watch &#150; alone.  This gave a heightened impression that what we were watching was normally observed privately.  According to the director of `Baise-Moi', the film is `a blood soaked road movie, but human, without artifice'.  Her synopsis is right on the mark, but she neglects to mention the extremely gritty look and feel of that road trip. Curious as to what the hype of the film hitting town might yield, it was determined this was surely not a film which one would need to see on the big screen.  Much of the footage could be pieced together from pay-per-membership sites on the Internet, allowing much more private study of the capers Manu (Raffaella Anderson) and Nadine (Karen Bach) pull off.   Spurred by a rape in the early part of the film, the pair set off on a killing/sex spree across the country (France).  If this is be a testament to feminists throwing off their man-shackles than we get the point early and often.  And only that point, since no other plot points were in evidence.  Suffice it to say there is no artifice, nor art, in `Baise-Moi'.  It would be interesting to poll the other audience members, but we are all safely back in our mother's basements.

They drift into their cross-country killing spree. True, early in the film Manu and a friend are raped in an extremely brutal, vivid, explicit scene, but unlike her friend, Manu is neither anguished nor shaken, just somewhat disgusted. She shoots her brother (friend?) when he gets angry on her behalf, swears he'll kill the bastards, but his words drift from anger into blame when he says she doesn't seem troubled enough by the rape. And Nadine sees her junkie friend killed. She runs into Manu by coincidence, and they stay together. The line of consequences is extremely blurry; there's more drift into mayhem, robbery and sex and killing, than in Thelma and Louise, to which this film is inevitably compared. If the movie works, it works not because of any 'see what the bastards drove me to' plotline, but precisely because they drift into the easy routine of shooting people. Not people they're angry at. Just people who happen to be there. Is it more shocking to see women blow people away than to see men do it--the usual film fare? There's a lot of very explicit sex, during which the women are in complete control, sure of getting their pleasure. Sometimes there's a mutual frisson as they watch each other having sex, and there are signs of homoerotic intimacy, but no love scenes between them. Their drive for sexual fulfillment sometimes works, and sometimes not, usually because it's so indiscriminate. Some of their partners are sexy, but others are hopeless dweebs. Then it leads to loathing, and loathing to killing. They also kill to get money and cars and food. There's no joy in killing for them, though they do enjoy the role of outlaws. Nor is there any epic rage, no feminist wrath-just lethal annoyance. It's not really a revenge film at all. Then there are some moments when the actresses have real electricity and sweetness, which makes the mix all the more perplexing. They marvel how long they've survived, and talk idly about making the jump without the bungee cord. It all ends badly, of course, with one dying, and the other, just as she's getting ready to die, arrested by dozens of angry men.  "},{"Title":"Slightly gauche, generally unfocused effort.

Baise-moi approaches sexuality with a startling but ironically healthier and more interesting perspective.The rape scene exemplifies this conceptual strength. What's most interesting about it is that it's not nearly as disturbing as you'd presume it to be. Most films with graphic rape scenes exploit the traditional mutilated sexual dialetic given to us by mainstream cinema/porn/commercialized culture (eg irreversable). In contrast the intial rape scene in Baise-moi serves as a preface rather than an anchor point to establish character motivation. Our heroine's nearly impassive expression throughout the scene betrays more boredom than devestation.There are worse things they could have done, they could have killed usSuch a great setup.Sadly, from there the film declines. Instead of exploring sexuality regardless of taboos, or capturing the mindless mechanics of sexuality in the context of the characters progression, the film seems to wander about aimlessly tossing in graphic sex and violence without any real coherence or meaning.With a deft director and a little more vision, this film could have been remarkable.

That one makes her living by occasional prostitution and loves masturbating to porn. She just killed her landlady in a quarrel. A woman is next in line because of her credit card. From now on there is killing without restraint. In most cases, not without having had sex with the male victims. You have not seen that much d*** sucking in any cinema - except for Blue Movies.

Those pornographic parts weren't the big problem if they lead the film anywhere. Yet they do not make it better. There is no logic dramaturgy, e.g. so that both women have their revenge on men in (ab)using them sexually and killing them afterwards. Sometimes they get it on and do not kill (probably, sex was o.k. and the man a bastard not that big), sometimes a playmate bites the dust or there is execution at once and no sex at all. The range of possibilities exhausts in occasional murders of women (why? They did not abuse those killer babes.). Just because they have money or happen to be present in a sex club giving some guy a blow job.A flick without rhyme or reason. Half consisting of real pornography (both main female characters are part of the porn biz), half consisting of violence, but lacking any stringent plot, not to mention logic. The authors seem to have watched to much  `Thelma & Louise', `Pulp Fiction', `Natural Born Killers' and diverse pornos. After, they decided to be able to do the same. Unfortunately, they were mistaken. This flick is nothing, not one of the things he wants to or that he could have been accusation of sexual exploitation, porno, action flick, gangster ballad.

The taboo-breaking graphic sex was of a cartoon nature too. Deliberately mechanical it had very little to do with sex as most would understand it. This sets it apart from pornography which by definition intends to titilate. In this regard Baise Moi does not fit into the porn category. It certainly has faults. Stylistically it does resemble a bad porn movie, but I tend to think that was the intention. Unlike many of the reviewers, I liked the acting and found the central characters essentially likeable in a strangely uneasy way which was essential for the movie to work.Like a rough cut Clockwork Orange this one may take on a cult status as an allegory for the clash between straight & bent, under-society & over society and particularly male & female.

By the way , i have to say that the opening scene really starts brilliantly if not misleading, a close up frame of one of the heroine, in an anxiety nervous look, covered in crimson red lighting, as if potraying a woman on the verge of explosion, after that it goes down the slope albeit still manages to shackle....So..as the film went on with its graphic viewing of penetration act and those usual hardcore porn cut footages, complete with some bad pre-millenium type of techno dance tracks, i tried to grasp the hidden message that unfortunately burried so deep inside this big chaotic smegma mess.And at the end i come to the conclusion that the film tries to tell a dystopic france where dudes ain't nothing but rapist woman beating pigs if not sleaze balls just looking for a quickie ,and women, they play the unfortunate part of not giving a damn yet still battered to pulp , physicially or emotionally ....and it just happens that this time the subject have reaches to exploit these two heroines that have nothing to lose, plus they are marginalized characters, being one is a part time prostitute full time pothead, and the other is a small time pornstar street wise type of tomboy who inside her heart cursed the world for what it is.Now, like i said , the message was presented badly (occasional vague acting by amateurs,bad music,holes that occur in the logic of the characters, and many more) which is what makes this film bad for me , although the shock value did give a little hint , these two women whos probably all their lifetime have been screwed by Men or by society in general , one couldnt help to think that in this film, Smith and Wessons, Glocks ,even high heel shoes acts as a metaphorical symbol of the Phallic, which the heronines used to screw back the society that have been screwing them (an obvious methapor close to literally screwing the society back example is the one at the orgy club , performed to the final unfortunate grunting victim) The continuous act of degrading woman also presented occasionally here however one that strikes me most is probably the one in the final scene, performed by the law system itself, alas, only verbally suggested.I considered myself as an experimentalist,to see this film for what it is, i dont bear any grudge or feeling cheated, considering that this is a directing debut from a porn actress, which obviously shows in the repetitive albeit not enoughly dehumanized sex scenes, however i get the nihilistic message , sorta, and i don't regret  purchasing this film either, just for reference sake, that the cinema industry is having a clash of reconstructing the limitation of provocative materials, how far is too far really?PS for lots of reason, one would like to watch this only with an open mind,contains openly act of penetration, fellatio that occurs in your usual X rated pornography,some uncomfortable scenes involving female bodily functions,lots of close up execution style head shots,bodily fluids and organic matters whether from intercourse and violence also appears for a few times.2.2 outta 5+2.2 for a valiant brave effort from Colarie Trinh and co to make this film knowing that theres going to be some amount of controversy, and for the accountable nihilistic subject that is probably frighteningly close to reality.-3.8 for a valiant effort from Colarie Trinh and co to make this film based on the knowledge that it is going to sell because they know people like controversial stuff despite it could be covered with 80% smut footage, and also for a crummy presentation.

True, this is the basic for almost the whole movie but for me it's also about the (unusual?) friendship between Nadine and Manu that keeps growing during the entire movie. The way those two hooked up was very interesting to see and it was even more interesting that they decided to 'live a little' in the way they do. I see it as an attempt for both woman to escape from their normal, dull and weird lives. Sometimes I even thought about Natural Born Killers, which resembles this film for a tiny bit. Not too much though, and that's a good thing. Baise Moi doesn't need any resemblance with NBK, the movie itself is quite good enough.The movie is filmed in a good way. You really get that excitement that the characters are experiencing and I really liked it that there are some comfortable silences in a lot of scenes.

Well, I am certainly not sick in the head. Nor am I somehow pro-rape!This film is shocking, twisted, nihilistic, brutal, uncompromising, and brilliant. Yes, it's grainy, and the acting is only adequate at best, but for sheer rawness, it can't be bettered. The plot is well-known, so I won't repeat it here. Despite the very, very explicit content, I genuinely believed that the film said something, both about sexualised violence as entertainment, and as s critique on French society.If you want to be titilated, or turned-on, then this is NOT the film for you. Nor is it a film for the shockable. Even those of you with strong stomachs, may still find some of what you see, very bleak and distressing. Despite this, I think that that is exactly what makes the film so good. If the violence and sex weren't depicted so unrestrained and graphically, then this would be no different to any number of cheap, Hollywood, direct-to-video pot-boilers. As such, it would be repugnant and very offensive to women. But it isn't. This is a film that will make you think about who you are, why you are watching this film, and what you want out of life. It will also make intelligent men squirm with horror, and think about the way they treat women in society.The two lead women do not discriminate against their victims. Male, female, young, or old it doesn't matter to them. And these two women, are just every day, run-of-the-mill people. People you or I could cross paths with, at any time.Like Henry Portrait Of A Serial Killer, the film is only rubbish to those who don't understand it, or don't want to understand it. It is only erotic to those who get turned-on by the slightest sight of nudity. It should only be banned, by those who don't approve of the way the women treat the men. But for viewers who look beyond the seedy, hardcore pornographic sequences, will see a shocking statement being made. Whether you choose to see that statement, is another matter.Superb drama, and a real one-of-a-kind experience, that no real fan of intelligent, sophisticated foreign film should miss. "},{"Title":"Written one week before it's blanket-ban in Australia","Date":"11 June 2002","Score":"","Genre":"Crime, Drama, Thriller","Review":"  There can be no doubt about it, Baise-Moi (F*** Me) is one hell of a controversial film, as it depicts explicit sex of the type normally only found in X-rated films, yet it is currently screening in Australia despite having been banned in over 20 countries, including it's homeland &#150; the normally permissive France. Based on the award winning book of the same name, writer Virginie Despentes has teamed up with &#145;adult film-maker' Coralie Trinh Thi to bring to life the story of two women on a sex and murder spree throughout France. Let's dispense with the obsessive argument about censorship, shall we? Unlikely as Baise-Moi's &#145;R' rating may seem, the fact remains that the film should only be seen by adults, just as it would be if it had the more appropriate &#145;X' rating. The chances of anybody &#145;accidentally' walking into this film are slim, so anybody who has gone to see it and is offended probably went so that they could be. Instead, let's talk about it from an artistic merit point of view. Baise-Moi is not the first film to go into this territory &#150; in recent years there has been films such as Catherine Breillat's Romance and Cedric Khan's L'Ennui, both of which depicted sexual acts just as explicitly. Where Baise-Moi delves into different territory is by adding a dimension of Tarantino styled violence in a would-be &#145;Thelma and Louise Go Crazy In Paris' sort of theme. The two heroines of the piece are Nadine and Manu &#150; Nadine is a sex-worker and Manu is a sometimes porn actress. The two meet shortly after Manu has been violently (and graphically) raped, committed a murder and then proceeds to kidnap Nadine because she knows how to drive the getaway car. Nadine has recently just witnessed the murder of her junkie boyfriend, and being in an extremely French nihilistic sort of mood, befriends Manu as the two of them ride a highway to hell, with plenty of gratuitous sex and violence along the way. One of the supposedly redeeming features of this film is that the sex and violence is perpetrated by these two women, something we would apparently find less shocking if these acts of violence were perpetrated against them. While this may be true to some extent, the graphic portrayal of these acts would no doubt be just as shocking no matter who was doing what to whom. If the justification of this is that violence and demeaning sex acts directed at women in modern cinema are not only more common, but sanitised to make them more acceptable &#150; it's a point of view that the audience must find for themselves. The use of real sex in cinema in recent art-house films has been to create a sense of gritty realism, to strip it of it's sanitised notions of romance and pave the way for a &#145;warts and all' examination of human sexuality &#150; or at least, that's one of the more popular justifications. If this is in fact the rescuing artistic merit of films such as L'Ennui and Romance, it can't really be applied to Baise-Moi in the same way. If realism is the goal, what of the large amounts of simulated violence in the film? OK, so it's a lot easier to ask your actors to get penetrated by a penis rather than a speeding bullet, but hey, you can just throw integrity right out the window, unless of course integrity is what you were planning on using to defend your artistic creation. Furthermore, if we are to believe that the two women are rebelling against the violence perpetrated against women in general and against sex workers in particular, why is it that the two lead roles are played by bona-fide porn stars? Did they have some political agenda of their own to promote? In all likelihood, no &#150; it probably just seemed like a good, adrenaline pumping exercise in violent fantasy. They were probably right &#150; because it certainly isn't art.

When Idiots was released in Britain some years ago, much was made of the fact that it contained the first erect penis in a widely-distributed feature film.Baise-Moi had many erect penises and many scenes of extreme violence. As a keen cinema-goer I like to think that I have become desensitised to on-screen killings, graphic sex etc. However, nothing could prepare me for this. The rape scene is incredibly harrowing -- I couldn't look at the screen towards the end -- and serves no apparent dramatic purpose.The same could be said of the rest of the film it serves no dramatic purpose the characters are one-dimensional and you never really understand why they have gone to such extreme lengths.I think there is a stong case that erect penises should be allowed in main-stream films. In some situations, they can be an important part of the plot. However, in this film, the like violence, they were simply gratuitious.A total waste of time.

I would hardly have thought of seeing this film if not for the (rather raucous) efforts of those seeking to ban it.  I can't see why any film should be banned (assuming it's not snuff, real-life rape, etc...) so I was pretty intrigued.  I don't like it when people have opinions about things they don't know anything about.  Therefore, to have an opinion, I had to see the film and see what all the fuss was about.2. 48 of the 50 people in the cinema - including myself - were male.  I counted.  That's 98%.  A vast majority was by himself, and middle-aged.  I reckon there are certain, distinct types of people who will see a film like this (a) those in for a good old fashioned perv; (b) those in for a good old-fashioned perv under the pretext that they're there for academic reasons - this is probably me; (c) those who believe the film should be banned and want to see the film so that people take their opinions seriously; (d) people without like controversy; (e) women who go with their husbands; (f) extreme female liberationists; (g) people who have to see it because it's their job; (h) people who absolutely don't want to see it for moral reasons but cave in under peer pressure.  I've probably missed a few out but that's the general demographic.3. Behind all the vivid sex and violence was a distinct women's lib sentiment the film is based on a book written by the director, who is female, and who wanted to make a statement along the lines of this film is mainly for women, but just you watch, lots of men will try to get it banned because of their hangups.  True to an extent, but certainly the audience, now that the media has jumped on the bandwagon, is going to be predominantly male.  As soon as people hear that there is real life sex in a film, men will come in droves and not particularly care about any hidden message, whereas the women, who the film is aimed at, won't even bother most of the time.  For this reason, the director has failed in her attempt to make a film just for women.4. Without doubt, this film - and probably the book which preceeded it - is controversial for the sake of being controversial.  No-one would attempt to include closeup scenes of penetration in today's society without wanting to offend, or at least be intentionally unconventional.  Trouble is, the vast majority of films/books/plays/etc which are designed simply to churn up controversy (despite the director's so-called real intentions) are critical and, to an extent, commercial failures.  If the film could have somehow incorporated the graphic scenes into the context of a plausible story - and let's face it, it simply can't be done, not when the scenes are of such a graphic nature - then it may have been almost acceptable.  Let's not forget that a sex scene even fifty years ago - that's maybe a generation and a half - was defined as having two people on a bed without feet on the floor.5. If this had been classified as porn, and I had been viewing it with mates on a home VCR, the non-sex bits would have probably been fast-forwarded and the graphic penetration scenes paused (or at least slo-mo'd).  It's amazing how different it is when you're in a theatre with a bunch of other people you don't know, many of them much older than yourself, a couple of them middle-aged women.  I'm not sure if I was actually offended myself, or embarrassed for the others.6. Maybe it was a bit of both.  I can't actually work out how it passed the OFLC - it had (or had) very strict rules about violence and sex scenes. Basically, if the sex scenes were simulated, then they were ok; if it was the real thing, then the scenes had to be omitted for release.  Any sexual violence was not to be tolerated except in very discreet ways which were essential to the story.7. Remember the thin, largely subjective line between soft-core porn and mainstream hollywood film?  It's been shattered.  This isn't even Non-Violent Erotica, which I think is banned in South Australia.  It's Violent Erotica, which I thought was banned in Australia full-stop.8. Having said that, it's still good the film wasn't banned.  I think it's important that people see things like this, and make up their own minds as to whether it is acceptable or not.  The people who bring up crazy arguments like, well, if it even makes one person out of 1000 go out and commit rape, then it should be banned.  I think if you followed that argument through, then we'd still be sitting around watching movies like THE SOUND OF MUSIC, which was a good movie, but there's only so much of it you can take.  Then again, does it have to be this violent?  I think I'll have to think about whether i'm a democrat, or part-socialist, or just confused.  I agree with some governmental intervention, but not to the extent of banning films, unless they contain snuff scenes, or scenes of real-life torture &c for exploitation purposes.  Documentaries, however, might be a different thing altogether...9.  All in all, the film was essentially crap.  Between the essentially needless violence and sex, there wasn't actually much plot, and it didn't differ too much from your average porno except that it contained violence, which I hadn't actually seen before in a porno film.10.  Is this going to be the future of filmmaking?  Probably not immediately.  I don't think it's an all too successful experiment, and i think, like most passing crazes, it will be a passing craze.  In 50 to 100 years, however, who can say? "},{"Title":"Mixed emotions...

On a personal level, I would also like some indication of execrable acting as I find that more offputting than sexual or violent content. However, I suppose that one can't have a perfect system. What I *don't* want is a censorship regime. This film to an extent rises and falls on the marketing which is applied to it. Unfortunately the distributor was advertising the film as being banned in France which is not correct - it has *never* been banned in France. This marketing tool certainly gave the moral majority (the bulk of whom I would assume have not actually seen the movie) an excuse to call for a ban. Of course, the allegation also increases film receipts by provoking the curious (such as me) to attend a screening. Another case in point is the title which can also be translated into English as Kiss Me - that's just not as provoking as Rape Me. There's nothing like a good controversy surrounding a film to create a box-office success.I've read the comparisons between Baise-Moi and Natural Born Killers and I agree that there is a general confluence of themes. The Thelma and Louise comparison is also reasonable on a limited level. I disagree with comments that the either the sex or the violence in Baise-Moi is gratuitous. Both are often the only expressions of power available to those society has trodden into the ground.

Yes, this is a bad movie.  Then again, there are many bad movies out there.  This fact alone does not excuse Baise-Moi from being a bad movie, which on many level it is.  However, Baise-Moi is an interesting movie that I think others should have the opportunity to view it because it blurs the boundary of film and pornography.  No, this certainly is no porn art; nor is Baise-Moi a filmic art.  Yet, Baise-Moi opens the door to a new exciting genre a hybrid of pornography and art.Some reviews seem to imply that if a film has real sex scenes, it should be on the level of art (i.e. art-house film); and this is where Baise-Moi fails in their argument.  Thus, I argue that a film which includes real sex does not necessarily mean it is an art film.  It can be art.  Then again, it can fail miserably.  Baise-Moi is not an art film.  Still, Baise-Moi should be seen because it opens possibilities of a new genre in film.Furthermore, there is a political edge in Baise-Moi. The film is a direct response to a male-dominated reality.  The viewer witnesses sexual and violent acts committed by women.  Of course, sex and violence are sex and violence, independent of the gender of their agents.  But it is more political when the agents of these acts are female if the viewer takes into consideration of the history of these acts  men are usually the perpetrators of these sexual and violent acts and women, their victims or subjects.  This is even more powerful when the sex acts depicted on the screen are real, and the writer and directors of the film are female.I do hope this movie establishes a new ground and inspires other filmmakers to explore this new film genre.  And I do recommend this film. Of course, I don't recommend viewing Baise-Moi with the family.  I give the film a 7 1/2.

It's very violent but no more than we are use to in any Swarzzenegger movie and actually less gory than most action movies these days. The porn is not that exciting and never seems to have that intention, so for that part it either succeeds in graphically us what we all ready know without getting turned on by it.

Yes it was violent, yes it was graphic in it's portrayal of sexual intercourse (hardcore in fact), and yes it was in-your-face. However, what unfolded during its meager 77 minute running time seemed, well, somewhat pointless. It is a film which seemingly advertises its message with all the subtlety of a Chevy commercial - watch out guys, chicks are getting their own back!!!The film owes a great debt to other rape/revenge 'classics' of the exploitation genre such as I Spit on Your Grave and Ms.45 (aka Angel of Vengeance). The lead character is brutally raped/beaten, then exacts her revenge on the perpetrators (I Spit..) or men in general (Ms.45), throw in a Thelma and Louise 'buddy' element and hardcore pornography, and what you're left with is Baize-Moi. Obvious enough, but the female killers of Baize-Moi tend to kill indiscriminately, with both women and seemingly innocent men (although the film would suggest no male is innocent neither on screen nor in the audience) falling prey to Manu's and Nadine's increasingly violent killing spree. This lack of purpose to the heroines' cause only serves to highlight a lack of purpose to the film itself.Similarly, the scenes of graphic sex seem to lose their power as the film progresses. Whilst shots of penetration during the rape scene achieve a disconcerting effect, highlighting the violation being witnessed by the audience, further 'pornographic' elements become seemingly pointless. Scenes of graphic sexual encounters are constructed not to emphasize the acts themselves, thus increasing their intensity, but to provide moments of pornography for pornography's sake. Sexual positions occasionally are achieved not in any naturalistic sense, but as 'poses' for the camera to achieve maximum 'coverage' of the act. Of course the juxtaposition of the these scenes with the scenes of violence which follow serve to highlight the film makers' 'feminist' agenda so you're enjoying this 'pornography' guys? Now watch this! Feel uncomfortable? Good? Couple this with the obviousness of male orientated Action flick references (one heroine's comment after a scene of violence where are the funny lines?. The John Woo style gunplay in the final shootout scene, and the posturing in front of a mirror with huge phallic gun a la Travis Bickle), and what we end up with is a film made seemingly, by two women who have attended a night class in Feminist Films 101. For all it's problems however, at least this film makes a refreshing change from the only alternative the Hollywood 'no brainers' that we are subjected to every summer. By no means a classic exercise in feminist film making, it's still worth a look for anyone seriously interested in film.

But the violence, though graphic in nature is nothing compared to what American audiences have come to expect. No exploding heads or limbs severed with chain saws. A very realistic rape scene with full male erection and female genitalia visible is done so quickly that it is actually somewhat arousing. But the subsequent sexual encounters are cold and stiff (no pun intended) and just don't work. In fact, all of the sex and violence occur so quickly that the audience really doesn't have the time to react. The vaginal penetration scenes push the American envelope, although they do add incredible realism. The blood and guts probably pushed the limits in France but are relatively tame by our standards.

It's almost moot to review it, given the unlikelihood that anybody in North America reading this is ever going to be seeing it.  It was rejected for a formal film classification in France, being labeled as porno.  And aside from the festival, it's already been banned everywhere in Canada except for Quebec City and Montreal.  America?  Forget it.The story is about two prostitutes who live and work on some pretty mean streets in France.  Their already hard lives hit rock bottom when they are abducted and violently gang raped by some thugs.  (Think that the rape scene in Jodie Foster's THE ACCUSED was excessively graphic?  In comparison to this scene, that one was a model of restraint.)  The younger one exacts vengeance in her own way, and acquires some money and a car in the process. She has to get out of town, but can't drive.  The other one can, and they team up Thelma & Louise-style for what turns out to be a very violent odyssey to the north shore of France.Essentially, it's a highway to hell killing spree movie, with the women using their wiles and seductiveness to destroy and rob men (occasionally women) and keep themselves living comfortably on the road..  They come to realize that a dragnet is closing in on them and that things can only end badly, but they frankly don't care, living only for the thrill of the moment until the final act.So IS it pornographic?  A resounding YES!  None of that soft-focus computer-generated virtual nudity here ... the sex is raw and genuine, with no organ or orifice left unexposed.  The cast (including the two leads) is comprised almost entirely of  porno actors (instead of just one, as in last year's controversial French festival entry, ROMANCE).  And there's an act of violence against a man late in the film that you've NEVER seen in any movie before ... we're talking a *major* ouch! here.But the movie also definitely DOES contain a storyline, character development, and production values -- elements traditionally lacking from what are thought of as porno films in America.  And it's SURE not the kind of film that porno patrons are looking for.  (I PITY any guy who ever brings this film to a bachelor party!)  It certainly held the interest of the two sold-out auditoriums where it was shown on the festival's opening weekend, and only a couple of people walked out.  There was applause for the two female co-directors following the show.  Porno elements aside, this definitely dose have some artistic legitimacy.  There's excellent Euro music accompaniment to some of the sex scenes as well ... I wouldn't mind owning the soundtrack album to this movie at all.If nothing else, this film nicely undermines Roger Ebert's never-ending crusade for an A (for 'adult') category in the MPAA film rating system to sit between R and NC-17 (porno).  Jack Valenti once offered to implement this system, provided Ebert and his employers were willing to indemnify the MPAA against lawsuits from producers whose films were labeled as porno. Ebert called this offer horsefeathers, saying that porno films don't get submitted for a rating anyway.  I was curious at the time as to why he didn't simply ACCEPT the offer, since, by his own reasoning, there was zero risk.BAISE-MOI provides the answer.  He couldn't accept it because there most certainly IS a gray area between artistic legitimacy and porno.  Ebert's always pointed to France as having a workable film rating system, but BAISE-MOI -- which WAS submitted for consideration -- exceeded even the most restrictive category and was banned, despite having enough artistic legitimacy to play at a film festival as prestigious as Toronto's.  If this film will stop his constant whining on this issue once and for all, we can all be grateful that it was made.

If you are looking for deeper meaning for the film, you'll never find it. All this is just as shallow as pornography is, except that this time it's all reversed. No one surely enjoys this film and if it's of any help it was also meant to be that way. It's all a very unpleasant viewing but it may serve as some kind of therapy to those people who hate pornography.

It's like a person who doesn't like country music reviewing a Hank Williams album. I just have to believe you knew what you were getting yourselves into when you went to see Baise-Moi, so get off the pulpit. In case anyone has forgotten, this movie was taken from a book. It is telling a very brutal story, so how could the film NOT be brutal? This is the type of film that I can only hope will eventually be made here in the States, and allowed to be released. I love that it is so stark and bold in it's story-telling. The graphic scenes, having been shot under natural lighting, have a certain realism to them that Hollywood just can't duplicate. It brings to mind another French film, Irreversilble, with an equally disturbing and unflinching rape and murder scene. Americans have a problem seeing on film the things that they perpetrate against themselves. Even Tarantino violence has a certain amount of staged look to it. This movie forces you to watch things that make you uncomfortable; in a way that it really might look if it were to happen to you.

Baise-Moi is another one of those blame everything that goes wrong on society-films and they're generally not very convincing.

They decide to travel around France together, leaving a trail of sex and blood behind wherever they made a stop. Although we're constantly exposed to pornography and violence, this film is very boring to sit through. Like the girls are indicating themselves all the time, the dialogues are lame and the people they run into (and kill&#133;) are very uninteresting.

It tries to shock, and yet it did not even live up to the hype even in this way.The film looks like it a low-budget, poorly shot made for French t.v. film in the 80s. Even the hairstyle look like the 80s. I'm not talking retro, cool stylistic 80s. I'm talking about the production values of 25 years ago. The rape scene did not even shock as much as it could have, there was no emotional investment in the characters when they were raped, there was absolutely no drama in it. I felt more shocked, and I ashamedly admit thrilled, in other less graphic scenes of that kind. It did not illicit any type of emotion at all. It was just poorly done.I watched this film to see a reviled piece of cinema which was a mix between Irreversible and Thelma and Louise. But instead I got a boring, semi-pornographic flick with the production and sytle of a made for french t.v. film in 1985.

You stated, basically, that porn is just porn and a movie is just a movie, but have you ever thought that the two combined as one may actually result in something worthy of a positive opinion, rather than just described in such a negatively biased manner as 'utter garbage'? Only being a 3rd year media / film student, I don't have that much experience over many people in the industry, but that doesn't mean that I don't know what I am talking about. Take this example; I don't agree with many special effects used in some of the modern films we now see, but that is because nowadays, people (as a generalisation) go to see a film for the effects. Whereas, in the many decades past, people used to see them for mental stimulation, where the story was the focal point of the film, with plot twists and so forth. Inbetween these two periods was the meeting of modern technology and film, in such classics as 'Tron', where the story and CGI worked in harmony with each other. I may be straying from the point, but all I am trying to say is that Baise Moi may be just like that meeting point of technology and narrative. The 'porn' seen in Baise Moi may benefit the story and vice versa, playing upon our visual and mental stimulation, so we react to it in a way that we could never experience with a purely narrative-based, or a visually-based movie. I find the story to be clever and emotive, and the 'pornographic' portions of it not particularly entertaining to watch, but essential to the movement of the movie.I think this movie has a well planned mixture of both visual and mental aspects, which make this film, in all fairness not a great film, but just a good film, which is both sometimes entertaining and stimulating at the same time.Phill "},{"Title":"Just not very good.","Date":"9 December 2004","Score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Crime, Drama, Thriller","Review":" This isn't a good movie.

The opening rape scene (which gives the title to the movie) is not as disturbing as you may think. Okay, let me get straight that ANY raping scene is disturbing, sick, uncomfortable, but in this movie it's not that disturbing mainly because of it's minimal production values, terrible direction and mediocre acting.The rape scene was just an excuse to display women revenge in a pathetical way. Manu seemed to be very calmed while being raped; in fact, she cooperated to make things not that difficult. You can't carry the whole movie on a scene with such terrible elements. OK the movie is not directed for all audiences but still if you're going to display extreme violence the least you can do is consider the production value.The following scenes are pathetic excuses to portray sex and violence scenes.

With a screenplay that could have been written by Andrea Dworkin, Baise Moi depicts the sex/crime/murder spree of our heroines as they emulate the 'black widow' style of fornication, often killing their partners after copulation. What fun! Unfortunately, it lacks any of the aesthetic appeal of Ridley Scott's Thelma and Louise, any of the crazy but mesmerizing extravagance of Oliver Stone's Natural Born Killers, or even any of the mordant wit of Remy Belvaux's Man Bites Dog (1992). It seems to be very much a film made by angry women, featuring angry women, with a target audience of other angry women, particularly of the man-hating-radical-lesbian-feminist variety. Veteran 'adult film' actress Karen Lancaume does have some nice moments in the role of Nadine. At one point, while wearing fetching lingerie, she does a Travis Bickle imitation with gun and mirror that is both chilling and amusing. Alas, these moments are few and far between. I think I'd prefer to view some of the films starring co-writer/co-director Coralie. Who could resist watching such titles as Pure Anal and Cunt Sucking Sluts 5?The DVD notes for Baise Moi indicated that this film had actually been banned in France (Oh my!). But I'm of the opinion this wasn't directly due to its extreme sex and violence. Rather, I think it was done to prevent a national crisis. In this film, every guy who pulls his pants down has an organ at least nine inches long (the minimum length requirement for any decent pornographic movie). Given that every Frenchman considers himself the world's greatest lover (or so I'm told by a female friend of mine who lived in France for a time), one can only imagine the ego-deflating horror endured by male members (no pun intended) of French audiences as they are forced to compare their own physical manhood to this parade of centaurs, one after the other. An epidemic of depression would sweep the country. Work stoppages would ensue. The government would collapse, perhaps even French society itself (mon Dieu!).

But, unfortunately, the message i received from the badly acted scenes and from the dramatical attempts of various characters too look typical and couldn¬¥t-care-less-realistical, from the embarrassing clich√©s (a particular scene of the two main characters dancing in the hotel room reminded me so much of south-american soap-operas that i still wonder how i could resist the temptation to use the fire-exit right then), the message, i was saying, was that maybe a not-so-inspired team of directors was only trying to push away just one more boudary, to step over just one more tabu, and doing this not as a means to some artistic end, but making it an aim in itself. And that is sad and offending.Moreover, the scenes of a pornographic nature were most probably intended to increase the emotions, by transmiting a sort of disgust for a sex-exploitive man-dominated society, but in my case they only worked for inducing the feeling that i am watching a sort of unfortunate hybrid species of a movie profoundly, a pornographic movie is only a succession of uninteresting badly acted non-sexual scenes (very often in real time) meant only to link the one sexual act with another (simplest explanation even pornography fans get bored to watch 90 minutes of hard-core sex, but then, neither they are really interested to follow a presumtive epical line, nor are the producers interested to go into such trouble/expenses to come out with one), in the same way, baise moi is just a succession of embarrassing wish-to-be-realistic-but-also-wish-to-be-associated-with-women-victimising- porno-industry-sex-scenes, meant to link different scenes of a pathetic non-depth, dabatably acted and emotionally main-streamed.

Two ruthless thugs rape two women in a garage, and these two unfortunate girls, Nadine (Karen Lancaume) and Manu (Raffa√´la Anderson), obtain guns and then launch a shooting spree. They rob a woman at an ATM and riddle several men. Most of the men and women that they murder don't deserve their fate. A lot has been written about the explicit sex scenes in this movie. Actually, you could probably find a much more explicit example of this kind of pornography. The two female directors do show penetration, but they don't show much of anything on the girls. Breast shots are held to an absolute minimum. The film contains no vestiges of humor. Nadine likes to rip the nylons that she wears before she has sex. These two are not only unsavory but also unsympathetic. The performances are forgettable. About the only scene that strikes an interesting note occurs early when one girl cries and struggles against the advances of one rapist and gains the attention of the other rapist. When the two rapists switch girls, Nadine neither cries nor struggles, and the rapist turns her loose. Perhaps there is a veiled message. The pornography takes up a minor percentage of the action. The dialogue--even in subtitles--is just as forgettable. Clocking in at 77 minutes, Baise-moi is mercifully brief. For the record, Nadine dies when she tries to hold up a store, and Manu is captured by the authorities as she contemplates suicide.

It may only be a diet porn, you know, just one calorie, but it's still a porn. Let's borrow a detail from good Ol' WikiPornography or porn is, in its broadest state, the explicit representation of the human body or sexual activity with the goal of sexual arousal and/or sexual relief. It is similar to erotica, which is the use of sexually-arousing imagery for mainly artistic purposes.Now, I realize that some may have a different view on what porn is, but in the end, and I DO mean IN the END, these chicks are having sex. Did I mention that there is penetration, REAL penetration, plus lots of oral sex, and even a semen scene? And blood. Did that get you yet?Of course, this movie was banned in a few countries for scenes like this. And it was a bit violent, though certainly low budget violence. It's torture porn which is influenced by the splatter genre. As the two women continue on their road trip, they shoot, bite, and sodomize for the sake of killing. Comparisons to the movie Thelma and Louise is ridiculous beyond belief because the characters don't have any depth, the script is junk and any resemblance to a good plot is just an imaginary hallucination. I also see some comments that state that Prudish Americans and British telling you that it is shocking and garbage and so on. Please. We prudish Americans and Brits brought you way better shocks, and the rest of the world knows it. Clockwork Orange, anyone? And who do you think brought grind-house cinemas, exploitation and slasher flicks to the table?So why give this movie anything more then a 1? Well because the main actresses, Lancaume and Anderson, really get into the parts. They are both real porn actresses, so making a film like this should be a snap. But they make it seem TOO easy. The loving looks on their faces with happy glee after they just finished offing someone is almost worth a see. Oh, and did I tell you that this movie has REAL full penetration sex? This is a TORTURE PORN movie, but those that glorify it calling it the best nihilistic event ever have not seen enough movies. Watch Doom Generation(1995)instead. You get all the sex and violence, plus a decent script and a rather bizarre ending that really grabs you. Otherwise, if you want to see a movie like this just for the real penetration scenes, rent a REAL porn. Duh.

Somewhat intrigued, I rented the DVD a few months later to see the first half of the film.Much I'm sure to some people's annoyance, I thought that it was a much better film than many give it credit for. Having seen the first 20 minutes (which went a long way towards explaining the carnage that followed), I'm now relatively clear about why it was banned in France - nothing to do with the explicit sex and not remarkably graphic violence, and everything to do with the image it leaves of the French under-class.I have no problem with graphic sex in a film so long as it has a role to play in the storyline. I must say that in this regard, what one sees in Baise-moi has a great deal more to do with the story than similarly graphic though rather less 'grubby' scenes featured in '9 Songs'.I suspect there is a degree of artistic snobbery behind much of the criticism of Baise-moi. I've seen films that cost a lot more and featured household names in the main roles that left me completely....emotion and opinion-less.Baise-moi suffers a bit due to being shot on what appears to be video and using all natural light. The acting isn't great, but I've seen worse. The editing is also a bit slipshod and there are some scenes in it that are probably not needed.But I'm willing to set these things aside because I think it's a really good story and one that, had it been given the full treatment (budget, craft, lighting, script editing, among others) would have been one of the most talked about films of recent years - and for the right reasons.

Violence, Drugs and prostitution are normal parts of life in this unnamed town. The stripped down production values help to project the grit, filth and claustrophobia of this urban nightmare. Greasy pimps look that much more repulsive in a grainy hand-held shot. Despentes paints a horrific picture of life for Manu and Nadine. We see Nadine performing a sex act as a prostitute and Manu is raped within the first 15 minutes of the opening credits.The rape scene is horrendous but what separates this scene from others is that there are hardcore penetration shots. The hand-held camera going uncomfortably close to a penis violating a woman is undoubtedly troubling to anyone, and with the toothless and bloody mouth of the victim screaming, it truly is one of the most intrusive and powerful rape scenes you will ever see.The BBFC have decided to ignore the multitudinous graphic erection and penetration shots and pass this film as an 18. If standard pornography is R18 certificate and has to be purchased in registered sex shops, then why is Baise- Moi available in our theatres and soon on the high street? Which opens up a massive debate about porn and art. Logic would decree that in order for this specialist treatment from the BBFC Baise-Moi must be making a serious artistic contribution.Defending the right to include hardcore shots is the aforementioned rape scene, but the prosecution against is the rest of the film. From the moment the rape scene ends Baise-Moi is void of any artistic, moral or sociological merit. The film loses all credibility when Manu and Nadine simultaneously their respective flatmates. These killings are given little or no emotive reason, and are so poorly executed that it becomes laughable; Nadine kills her flatmate by dry-humping her!There is a lot of debate about the artistic merit of Baise-Moi, and there's no doubt that the rape scene is powerful, but it is not backed up by any other substance in the film. Despentes seems to think that the rape scene will be enough to keep this film afloat and forgot to write anything else in the story that could evoke any interest. Our Thelma and Louise characters shag, steal and kill their way around France. Violating and humiliating men as they go, oh wait I get it now! They're treating men like they have been treated by men! It is an obsolete point that is hiding behind an excuse of trying to provoke debate and controversy. Feminism takes us much damage from these characters as matriarchal values.The message is mixed, at times Baise-Moi plays like a crime buddy movie, but then at others it's trying to be a Nihilistic attempt to portray meaninglessness. How can it be meaningless as well as encapsulating the power of femininity and female friendship?None of these points can be taken seriously though as the performances from Bach and Anderson are so blatantly amateur as to detract from any immersion into the non-existent plot.One scene of dramatic worth and a lot of hardcore sex is not enough to make this art.

Maybe that's not politically correct, but when people go crazy, they sometimes look evil from the outside. What can you do? This movie is not strong on solutions, and it does seem to enjoy being mean. That's fine art does not always have to provide people with explanations and solutions.This one here is just trying to tell a story of poverty, madness and violence without patronizing the poor or insane.

And that's what makes me watch certain movies again and again (e.g. Pitch Black). After all this movie will be some sort of classic as Deep Throat though Baise Moi has much more to enjoy and much more complexity.

Exactly why she wants his sorrow isn't made clear as she seems to look on the episode as water off a ducks back.  Her friend and fellow victim shows a more realistic reaction (though rest assured that non of the acting ever reaches the dizzy heights of believable) but the film never conveys for a second the horror of rape (see Irreversible). Running parallel to this `story' another woman murders her flat-mate, apparently because she was tired of being nagged about smoking too much weed, watching too much porn, and having friends who spill coffee.  It is never explained why she couldn't take a more suitable (sane) course of action like moving out, so we are left to presume she is off her nut.  She goes to meet an old buddy (the coffee spiller) who is also killed, apparently we don't need to know by who, or why, but the last thing she promised him she would do is go to France and meet a friend (a drug deal I think, I'm not watching it again to make sure). This is the point where the film goes downhill, it's hard to believe, but it actually gets worse.  You might be able to stomach the clumsy set-up of the first 20 minutes if they did something with it, but scenes become more and more embarrassing.  The meeting between the two women, for example, and their agreement to become outlaws is cringe worthy.  Crammed into a few minutes the actors blurt out their pasts to each other and are then on the road, they've never met, but within a day they're shooting the skull out of a woman in order to pilfer her bankcard. The last hour is a series of set pieces where the road buddies either kill or have sex or both.  None of these scenes are excessively violent or pornographic, as others suggest, and soon become tiresome.  The film doesn't move an inch between the first and last attack, which left me quite bored and meant I didn't care whether they got away with it or not.Avoid this film at all costs, certainly don't make the same mistake as a friend of mine and actually buy it.

Spoilers!","Date":"26 December 2003","Score":"2 out of 4 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Crime, Drama, Thriller","Review":"   I saw this film about three months before I ended up seeing the infamous 'Irreversible.' Since they are both French, they sought of stick out in my mind together. However Gasper Noe's 'Irreversible' is much better and actually has something to say. What the hell is wrong with France? These films are released and then I hear that gang rape amongst French youth is on the increase in the ghetto areas. Are there too many people working at the post office or what? I thought French people lazed around reading Sartre and drinking red wine. Not brutalizing each other so badly that they will be traumatised for the rest of their lives!   When I went to see this, the idiot ticket vendor would not sell the damn ticket to me because he was Christian and believed that I would be condemning myself to hell by watching this film. They also looked at me as if I was forcing the female person I was with to see it! I was not! GROAN!!! Also why do Christian politicians insist on banning films? Both Ken Park and Baise Moi were banned and then released. This then had the effect that everyone 18+ in Auckland came out and saw the two films. In fact Ken Park was probably more popular than Attack of the Clones here! 'Baise Moi' is really bad. It is shocking but that does not make a good film.  It seems like a porn director wanted to make a bad Tarantino knock off. It is paint by numbers Tarantino, but without any of Tarantino's talent. The acting is bad and the story weak. It is exploitation and well...it's violent porn essentially. I mean Russ Meyer made films that mixed sex and violence but his films were way more entertaining. The whole film looks like a bad home movie. It seems like the people involved just wanted to make some easy money by shocking everybody. What irritates me about films like these is that they try and attempt to present themselves in a sought of arty-indy veneer. This way it gives the film more street credibility. One reviewer here states this is punk rock film making. No, this is just very bad film making. This is certainly not 'art.'  The fact that it was made by two women just adds a kind of Annabel Chong self loathing to the whole exercise. I mean it is a film that literally goes from one violent/sexual scene to another. The characters are psychotic and well...jaded beyond belief. But with the constant bombardment of violent images, this just jades the viewer as well. For example after having being delivered a horrible scene of rape. The two women go and stomp a guy to death for being a 'condom dickhead,' yawn... I mean 'Henry, Portrait of a Serial killer' got its point across much more effectively. The serial killer at the bottom of society, travels around the country killing because he has nothing else. It was also not glorified porn. The viewer knows that this is cheap exploitation when the murders get more and more grand. By the end of the film you observe them taking out a whole swingers club! Then one of the woman puts a gun to a guys chocolate starfish and pulls the trigger! I almost hid under my seat when this happened! It also seems that this is an attempt by the film makers to offend people and thereby causing more people to see it. They  probably made the scene thinking, 'man heaps of people are going to come out and see it for this.' What troubles me is that if this was made by men there probably would have been a bigger outcry. But because it was made by women it probably went under the radar a little more. Is there a double standard out there? Also one of the main characters looks shockingly like Darlene from that old sitcom Roseanne. Is this what she is doing now? If it is then please somebody get her some decent work!     Finally I found this film to be puerile, juvenile and as dumb as a box of hair. The film is extremely annoying and like a little kid that swears for attention it should just be ignored. I give 2 out of 10. The extra point goes to the fact that I was actually on a date when I saw this and it was the girls idea. Maybe I have a strange sense of humor but I found the whole situation quite funny. Obviously she was horrified and it really made me feel like Travis from 'Taxi Driver!' This is not a date film!

Myself, I was drawn to it because of the supposed feminist content. Supposed being the key word. Because there are female leads and a rape scene, I suppose it's reasonable that some people come to that conclusion, but it's the incorrect one. First, a short word on content. I don't normally watch porno, so the sex stuff was shocking in the sense that I wasn't expecting quite that level of graphicness. Let me just say, the word 'tasteful' has no place here. It didn't traumatize me for life, I'm just telling this to let readers know who might be wondering-you will be in for a full-on hardcore porn film with an extended plot line.I find it hard to believe that even the most extreme strains of feminism could find anything of value here. Not only do these women kill men who, within the logic of the plot line, could be construed as 'deserving it', but they kill women who did nothing more than cross their path. One of the women kills her roommate because she dared to suggest she should keep up with her roommate responsibilities. They both kill a woman going to an ATM. And an indiscriminate bloodbath occurs at a sex club. The rape scene is confusing because while it could be pointed to as a trigger, the woman raped seems almost nonchalant about it. Denial? Something going on below the surface? Perhaps. But that's a realm of subtlety the film doesn't seem to have much of. I guess if you're being extremely generous, you could say the women are simply a product of a crazy society that treats women like crap and now that society is getting its just desserts, and here's how it would play out. But it seems more like a cover. A thin veneer of integrity placed by the makers to display nihilism. Because that is what it's about-nihilism. Life is a crazy meaningless escapade, so get your kicks any way you can.There are many other shortcomings to the movie. I just didn't find it believable these women would suddenly start killing, be so good at it, and find it all so irrelevant. And what are the apartment walls in France made of-ten inches of lead? No one could hear gunshots and beatings going on? And the streets are always deserted except for the hapless victims? I suppose these logical failings also apply to ninety percent of the typical Hollywood action movies, but I had to mention it.This film is a disappointment, it could have been something of a modern day exploration of forces shaping the lowest of the lower class, women, and I don't mind debauchery if it has a point. This didn't. I just felt manipulated. Two stars for trying something different, and for at least not boring me.

Now, the marketing geniuses behind Irreversible, Romance and Baise Moi have decided it would be great if French cinema really was about two people in a room having sex.This is all very perplexing&#133; Baise Moi is essentially the younger, more disturbed suck and f*ck sister to Ridley Scott's Thelma and Louise.

It's certainly an achievement; getting general release permission for a hardcore film past the most scissor-happy censors in Europe. But art? Erm, no.All of that said, the film could have been worse. The acting is actually rather good, considering the fact that &#150; although having a huge body of films behind them &#150; the stars are more usually credited as performers than actors. The rape scene at the beginning is one of the most harrowing (and I suspect realistic) on film. There is nothing remotely romantic or titillating about it. The message about how a bleak, mean life invokes nihilism is not new but it is well made, and at least the film tries to have a message.Perhaps, if there is a virtue to the graphic sex, it is that it stops the audience having to engage their imagination. May be the sheer mindlessness and pointlessness is the point.

I have now seen a movie that makes Gigli look deep and meaningful. Some reviews I have seen described this piece of trash as a film about female sexual rage or empowerment. That is nonsense. There is nothing empowering about this movie and the rage demonstrated has nothing to do with being female.The synopsis of this movie at netflix describes Manu as being a hardened young waif and Nadine as a tough-skinned prostitute who sells her body but refuses to give up her soul. Not only are those descriptions misleading, they're entirely inaccurate. The hardened young waif is actually a girl from a bad neighborhood who's involved with all manner of crooked people and who's starred in apparently more than one cheap porn flick. The tough-skinned prostitute seems to be a sex addict who just found a way to make money from her habit. As for refusing to give up her soul, it doesn't seem she had one to begin with. The two of them meet by chance, Nadine recognizes Manu as the star of some of her favorite porn flicks and the two embark on a killing spree along the lines of Natural Born Killers, but without the plot, killing just about anything that moves and getting their ya-yas off in the process. Fine. Just don't try to convince me there was anything deep or philosophical behind it.As for female sexual rage or female sexual empowerment I would have to say that was done way better in Thelma & Louise, Dispara (a.k.a. Outrage) with Antonio Banderas (bonus), or even I Spit on Your Grave, which even though it seems a tad like an expoloitation film, at least makes some sense as far as the resulting murders. I read that this movie was banned in France. I can see why. I'd have banned it too. Not because of the hard-core porn scenes or the excessive and senseless violence (I am American after all and don't we just love our senseless violence to death...) but because it was BAD! An embarrassment to French cinema, maybe. Certainly an embarrassment to filmmakers everywhere. Oh, and the video quality itself was so grainy on the dvd I rented that it made me wanna check my cable connection, despite the fact that I was fully aware that I was watching a dvd. Don't even get me started on the music chosen for the soundtrack.If you decide to see this film and end up bashing your dvd player into dust with a Louisville Slugger, don't say I didn't warn you.

I wouldn't recommend anyone waste 77 minutes of their life viewing this because it's lifeless, pointless and (beyond a certain yuk factor) ultimately very boring.Yes, it's true that it's shocking at a certain level to see the sex and violence that appear in this film, but there's no depth to that shock, there's nothing to provoke an emotional response because it's almost impossible to believe the events are linked to reality. We have no sympathy or even empathy with the characters in the film so at the emotional level we feel nothing.In a way, this is the art-house cinema world's equivalent of those Hollywood blockbusters which rely entirely on special effects and spend no time at all on plot or characterisations. Baise-moi relies entirely on predictably shocking situations and is plot less and character-free. Who are these people being murdered, and who are these people doing the shooting? And why is this happening? None of these questions are answered, so all you're left with are some uninspired and unoriginal visuals.Baise-moi does for sexuality and violence what Jurassic Park did for the ethics of cloning absolutely nothing. It's a cheap ride which exploits serious issues without ever taking those issues seriously. Rape is supposedly central to the film, but the emotional side of rape is ignored because the emotions of everyone involved are ignored. We have no idea what motivates anyone or what affects anyone on a personal level , because the script, acting and directing never address any of these areas. Worst of all, arguably the most horrific impact of rape, its mental scars, are completely glossed over. Rape in this film seems to be an entirely physical act, when in reality the motivation is often more to do with power and instilling a submissive mindset in the victim.You'll find some people claiming the film is about a rape victim taking the fight to the rapists, but that's just a total lie. This film consists of a series of random murders of absolutely anyone without any pattern however twisted men, women, rapists, non-rapists, pimps, prostitutes, complete strangers, anyone, almost all with no provocation whatsoever.You also get the feeling that if this film had been made by an American man instead of a French woman, no film festival or TV channel would have touched this with a barge pole. It's a sad state of affairs where the quality of art is pre-judged not by its contents but by the gender and nationality of its creator. Didn't any of them dare to say The Emperor Has No Clothes when they saw the preview tapes?In fact it's interesting to note that most of the people defending this film seem to display snobbery towards anyone who didn't like it.The Snobs imply that anyone who criticises Baise-moi must automatically be against all art films in general. They seem to think an attack on Baise-moi is an attack on art itself.Not so, and that kind of attitude is identical to and just as misguided as George W. Bush's You're either with us or against us philosophy.Anyone who has ever experienced the poetry of William McGonagall or the cinema of Ed Wood knows that an inflated opinion of one's own artistic abilities is no substitute for actual artistic abilities. McGonagall and Wood both had an absolute belief that they were creating high art which people would take seriously, yet they both failed to ever do this even once in their lifetimes. There is poor quality stuff out there as well as good quality, and it is completely okay to say some art is worthless while still being a fan of art in general.Baise-moi is worthless not because it's controversial, not because it's explicit, not because it's violent. All those things can and regularly do form part of some of history's greatest films. But not in Baise-moi.Baise-moi is worthless purely because it doesn't make you think in any way whatsoever. The only possible things you might appreciate are all superficial, and there is no depth to reach by scratching the surface. The surface is all there is, and it's a pretty ugly surface too.Maybe its worst crime is that it makes it slightly harder for other directors, directors with talent, to tackle similar themes. Baise-moi is a gift to every conservative who thinks art-house films are worthless exploitative trash masquerading as art, because, well, that's exactly what Baise-moi is.I love art films, and I have zero problem with them using any imagery or any themes whatsoever as long as they manage to make me think. This film doesn't do that at all, it just bored me. I don't want to ban it, I just want to warn people that their money and time will be wasted if they try and view this film. You'll get as much intellectual stimulation from watching a Chuck Norris film.So what went wrong in Baise-moi? I'm guessing the directors (who have never directed anything before or since) thought that simply showing a series of events was enough to make a good film. In fact good films do more than this, they show a interesting characters, or events, or imagery, or sometimes all of these things. There's always something to get hold of in good films, something to analyse or follow in your mind, but there's absolutely nothing here, nothing at all.There is no entertainment in Baise-moi, no thought, no emotion, just posturing of the worst kind. If cinema has gotten to the point where controversy alone is equated with intelligence and bravery, then there's no hope for intelligence and bravery in film-making any more, stereotypes will have triumphed over talent.

There is a degree of misandry in the casual violence inflicted against various men. However, I found myself cheering these acts on and rooting for the girls. The portrayal of sex is unusually explicit and I found this refreshing, far tamer than actual porn but still real(it helps to know the 2 main characters were transitioning from actual careers in porn!). It was refreshing also because the film was written by women and so women were not the victims of violence but revelled in being instigators. There was a definite edge to the disassociative personalities of the 2 women, who offered little reaction to their killings other than joy and I found this a good portrayal of sociopathy. The women did have redeeming features and some level of justification for their heinous acts. It was certainly a window on evil, but why should that always be about evil men? This caught me by surprise and I highly recommend this movie if you like sex and violence. If you have disdain for the likes of Rambo forget it!

Everything in this movie feels like it's been built from very cheap ideas, as if the director has said Ok, we like sex, we like violence, we like clich√©s and we like to shock, let's build a story around that'.The thing is that the scenes and emotions behind all these ideas are barely explored at all, and so we get scene after scene of rather emotionless sex, which sets up scene after scene of extremely dull male characters getting murdered by the two female leads. The violence is certainly graphic, but when you don't feel any kind of emotion toward either the victims nor the murderers, it's a really unsatisfying experience.The two female leads Nadine and Manu, are utterly unconvincing, they do not appear scary, threatening, tortured, they barely seem friends. One of the most interesting parts of the film is when a soon-to-be victim tries to talk to Nadine, trying to establish what it is they've been through to drive them to this point. But without even looking slightly vulnerable from this emotional probing, she just shoots him after the cheesiest I'm not going to kill you - she is overdone one-liner of the film! There are so many scenes which seem to serve no other purpose than to show some violence, and to push the two leads in to meeting and forming the dullest on-screen chemistry of the whole film. Nadine has a great chemistry with her junkie friend Francis, but as soon as this is established he's shot for no relevant reason. Manu's brother seems interesting, equally loving and ashamed of his younger sister,but of course she shoots him because he pisses her off a little bit, despite how much she seems to also love him.The film feels like it prides itself on controversy, and that it relies on this alone to carry it. Yet it fails to shock because you feel no attachment and more importantly no belief in the characters and events that are occurring. Only the prudish will find this film shocking, those that are uncomfortable seeing any full frontal nudity or gore.For the rest of us who have seen sex and violence, there are plenty of films out there that will provide far more emotional stimulation and exploration than this waste of time!

Elvis did it and was seen as a communist plot, Breton did it and was accused of anarchy and Stravinsky's Rite of Spring had 1913 Parisians rioting in the streets. But now that the entertainment industry has finally perfected the art of all-out homogenisation; creative endeavour, with very few exceptions, continues to flounder behind the zeitgeist. Baise Moi seized it and buried it in its own blood.Based on the novel by ex-prostitute Virginie Despentes, who co-directed the film with Coralie Trinh Thi, Baise Moi tells the story of two young women runaways who race each other to oblivion and mean to take anyone who gets in their face with them. The two leads are played convincingly by ex porn stars Raffaella Anderson and the aforementioned Karen Bach. If you can imagine Thelma and Louise on a PCP comedown, you're nearly on the money. This is essential viewing but bare in mind that few profound experiences are happy ones and watching Baise Moi is a perfect example of what this means. This is real and unashamed punk cinema, and to see it on the shelves of HMV in the '3 for ¬£20' bin must have definitely given a fair few casual punters a bit a jolt once they'd settled in with a bottle of Merlot for a Sunday evening viewing. Believe &#150; as far as commercially available films go &#150; this should carry a government health warning. It barely helps that this is a female led production and thus avoids the cheap and easy 'female exploitation' charges as it graphically depicts those staples of the cinematic experience, sex and violence, at a level rarely seen in mainstream cinema.Baise Moi is the result of a specifically female rage and although Karen Bach's sad exit was not a direct result of having made this film, the road she walked was a dark one - and when you make that journey there will be casualties.

Don't expect an art film, expect a teen film, based on Virginie Despentes' teen novel. Perhaps it could be thought an achievement of some sort that this porn movie has slipped into mainstream, back where Deepthroat once slipped out. Perhaps it is a sign of the culture porn movies are being accepted as movies, although grudgingly.Nevertheless, the film's cinematic merits are akin to a typical porn movie, with the addition of non-typically bloody violence. Bloody, really, because I don't think I saw a single bit of gore amid the ketchup bursting all over the sets. It's not really very realistic, and not particularly detailed either. The film's porn actors can't act, which wouldn't really be needed either with the poor script and poor base material, the novel. While some would-be niche art aficionados tell to seek for the movie's reasons and motivations deeper, but the story arch simply has no depth. Every turn of the story is as simple as possible, and its developments show either a profound lack of writing skills or a deliberate simulation of talentlessness.What's there to like? What's there to hate? Nothing. With the exception of the rape scene, this film is light as feather. No point, no reason, not even underneath a seemingly meaningless cover.

Don't believe me, its all about duality... the first girl represents the body, she gets raped the second girl represents the mind, Godart her friend is killed (godart/god).So with an abused body and no moral authority the story really starts...But you know what really, really, makes me think this is a film of value is the fact its so womanly.I'm a man, by the way, and what i can't stand is feminism thats all lardy dar, womens lib and its alright to say no. Like they never read the female eunuch, Its alright to say Yes, Yes, Yes.This film has something to say on the subject-and i have to admit that i walked away from this film feeling like i understood a womans world more.

Baise-moi means f*ck me and not much else, and translating it as rape me I think makes the movie worse by giving it another direction (since there is a rape scene in the movie after all).  Not that it isn't bad to begin with.  I was actually disappointed (yes, I was hoping for a difference).  I was hoping that a female pornish movie would have more taste than this, but it's just as bad as though it were filmed by a man.  I still do think that this movie fulfills more male than female fantasies.  So although there was a lot of sex it wasn't interesting.  If you are familiar with French TV, this movie is equivalent to a Canal + movie on a Saturday night (although this has less sex, but it's the same type of sex and sex shots, give or take degrees of intensity).  But I have to say, that even in terms of a sex movie this was a let down.  Since Nadine and Manu are so into sex as a thing in itself, why didn't they sleep together when they were bored and had nothing to do?  It might have given the movie some dimension.  I'm surprised though how everyone is taking time to write about this movie although all the reviews are bad. I'm also surprised that it was released worldwide, it really does not deserve all that attention.  And I don't think we can blame it solely on the script; it's bad direction (had Tarantino been given the script he would have made something very different).  It was a flat movie, with horrible dialogs (and performances) and a trashy soundtrack.

A good movie can be made about any subject. It can contain rape, graphic sex and extreme violence, as long as they're justified by the material and the director has a moral viewpoint about them. The rape in IRREVERSIBLE concentrates on the woman's emotional torture; the one in BAISE-MOI literally focuses on the physical penetration. The difference is clear.

Those movies are devoted to people getting off on sex. Not the case here.

With an impulse relatively no more powerful than that motivating the two women, whole groups devolve into similarly murderous binges on national levels. People are uncomfortable contemplating the paper thin wedge separating humanity from casually enthusiastic slaughter. And because their sex games stem from the same self-interested, hardly conscious urge to gratification, the acts of violence and coitus portrayed interleave in a manner connecting them beyond juxtaposition. In that way the whole film may be seen as a pornographic meditation, considering pornography in its definition as exciting not sexual, but emotional energy.I won't propose to explain the filmmaker's intentions, I don't know what they were. The movie certainly wasn't artful, but it has a power.

Sadly, Showgirls was an entertaining film in the sense of its own ridiculousness. Baise-moi brings many adjectives to mind when describing it, but entertaining sure as hell wasn't one of them.To call it a feminist film is like calling The Texas Chainsaw Massacre a film that puts forth the cause for the mentally ill, in that it goes way too far to fit its own description. You can bet there will be plenty of borderline-disturbed young men who will be packing steel and possibly even inflicting retribution in advance after seeing this film. Not that this is necessarily the fault of the film, but in today's climate of letting the abused turn into the abuser, it isn't helping anything.There certainly isn't a plot to speak of. All there is to this film are a string of explicit sex, rape, and violence sequences, loosely strung together by the two protagonists' journey to meet with one of their friends. Along the way, they proceed to unleash seven times what they have been put through early on in the piece. Any pretense of sympathy for them quickly disappears because what starts as a series of confused, hurt revenge killings soon dissolves into a psychotic frenzy of random violence with motives one would expect to find in a Friday The 13th film.So in a nutshell, what we have here is a pornographic film pretending to be art-house and claiming righteous motives. It fails because it tries to make a statement and falls into the trap of being no better than the things it is trying to make a statement against. If the director's intention was to make a film that stated how much nicer it will be if we make up for a couple of thousand years worth of Christian oppression by allowing women of all walks to maim and kill men at will with no visible motive whatsoever, then they succeeded. However, in succeeding with that, they also utterly fail at having anything relevant to say. They fail at making the lead characters anything other than spokespeople for wife-beaters, and they fail at entertaining anyone. In the end, they just utterly fail.Ironically, had the OFLC just allowed this film to be released in Australia without any of the nonsense of allowing it to be screened then suddenly banning it, it would have died a very quick, embarassing death here because people would have seen it for what it is.

This movie is the hardest hitting feminist statement ever committed to film. While many 'feminist' directors tend to go for soft edge, sugar coated tales which deal with emotions, nurturing and bonding, thus compounding all the stereotypes regarding women, Baise Moi goes for the jugular &#x96; that women placed in adverse circumstances can be every bit as vicious and ruthless as their male oppressors. Coralie may have a bit to learn as a director, but her rawness actually adds to the electric experience of watching this movie. I had read mixed reviews but left feeling both angry and uplifted at the same time. Angry because the film shows the kind of exploitation faced by women every day, but uplifted because of the sheer force these sisters use to satisfy their own desire for sexual and physical freedom from men and society in general. Both leads embark on their crime spree after murdering somebody close to them. Manu shoots her brother after he is unsympathetic after she has been raped, while Nadine beats her repressed flatmate to death. In both cases our heroines reject in the strongest possible terms the attempts of their victims to condemn their lifestyles. Much of the accusations that Baise &#x96;Moi is not a feminist piece come from Manu & Nadine's first murder as a couple. They kill a wealthy looking woman in order to steal money. I reject this argument because this wealthy woman with her designer clothes and jewellery is like many women part of the problem. Across the road from her are two women in need of help, but she ignores them as she withdraws cash she has obviously come by as a willing and subservient pawn of patriarchy. Are male heroes expected to be so noble when they pursue their goals? &#x96; of course not. The couple subsequently commit more murders for the hell of it, including the brutal beating to death of a guy who employs them for sex, then announces he wants a condom. Some have asked why he deserved to die as he was not aggressive to the women and I give two reasons. Firstly he aimed to exploit their bodies for money and secondly he implied they were dirty, diseased and unclean. More killings follow, including a couple of cops, a criminal businessman and the male and female patrons of a swingers bar. It is interesting to note which men they encounter survive &#x96; these are men they choose to have sex with on their terms, who don't try to dirty the proceedings by owning the women by offering money and let the women gratify themselves sexually. There is a message for all men here. My only gripe about this movie is that we do not see the women become lovers. I am sure that Coralie could have given audiences a far more realistic picture of how women really make love to counter the male porn industry stereotypes with their soft focus lighting, big haired synthetic moaning Barbie dolls and wailing saxophone music. Showing the women reject men as an option when considering a deeper relationship would have made this film a 10. Regarding the sex content, it is explicit and though lesbians do not particularly want to see throbbing penises, it is obvious the sequences were shot with women in mind. Coralie concentrates on female pain and humiliation during the rape scene and female pleasure during the later sex sequences. For those who dismiss this movie as porn, I suggest they look at the definition of pornography in any dictionary. True porn is produced to elicit an erotic arousal rather than an aesthetic or intellectual response. Bearing this in mind anyone can see that Baise Moi, though containing scenes which are explicit is NOT pornographic. Baise Moi makes the viewer if she is really watching think and feel, not grope for the Kleenex like most male viewers probably hoped.All in all this is a must see for all women who are truly liberated. This is a revenge movie with a difference.

Nor is photography, Andy! Blacklist me. Actors and Actresses... don't exist in my world. Thelma and Louise revisited. (but which came first? I think it was Thelma &Louise.) Porn is no longer a viable medium. Feminism is more often than not misogyny in film. Boys enjoy humiliation... and then btches get it in the end. Vachelettres would like to show U the other side of Romance & Love... maybe you'll get it, maybe not. I don't care. I wrote it for myself. If only Rape Me would've been made without commercial consideration and included no rape porn etc... Am I an uptight Ol Fogy? Yes I am. I still believe in God, Romance, Human Values, LOVE (Lou Reed remains relevant... will always remain relevant).

What rot.We meet a bunch of young, French low lifes. A prostitute, a junkie, a drug dealer, a couple of street thugs, etc. Funnily enough, all the men are brutish, unkempt and ugly, but the women are really good looking and appealing.The music alternates between bad jazz and bad rock.Two women are slapped around by a gang and raped. The filmmakers take the pains to give us a couple of explicit hydraulic close-ups, but it's brief, grainy and shot in a dark room. Why bother? Two women bond and kill a guy who pisses them off. Then they hit the road and start killing indiscriminately. They are alienated women rebeling against polite society, you see.The filmmakers want to say, We are French and we show the nasty truth about society. But the film says, We are French and we make pretentious claptrap containing gratuitous porn. "}]
