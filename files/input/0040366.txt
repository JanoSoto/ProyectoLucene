[{"Title":"Classic film noir which finishes too soon","Date":"30 December 2001","Score":"35 out of 37 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Crime, Drama, Film-Noir","Review":"  This is a gripping film noir, dark and despairing in mood, co-written and directed by Abraham Polonsky, shortly before he was blacklisted in Hollywood for his left-wing views. Those views are perhaps implied in the plot, which is about the illegal numbers game, and the attempt of a big operator to gain a monopoly of the racket in New York. The film shows how everybody from the individual punter putting a few cents on a number to the gangsters making a fortune out of the operation is soiled by the racket. For Polonsky, the numbers game may have symbolised capitalism as a whole, with both bosses and workers being corrupted by the system. However, the details of the plot are less important than the mood, characterisations and visual aspects of the movie. John Garfield is brilliant as the charming, amoral lawyer Joe Morse, a Mr Fixit for racket-boss Ben Tucker (Roy Roberts). Thomas Gomez plays Joe's sick, world-weary brother Leo, who also runs an illegal numbers game, but independently of the mob, in an honorable and decent fashion. Some of the best scenes in the film show Joe trying, as he sees it, to help Leo by bringing him into Tucker's operation, while Leo resists and berates Joe for using his ability and education in such an ignoble cause. Much of this intense dialogue is reminiscent of that in plays by Clifford Odets or Arthur Miller.  Also compelling, but with a lighter feel, are scenes between Joe and Doris (Beatrice Pearson) a quiet but assured young woman who works for Leo. Joe adopts slick patter, and runs himself down, in an attempt to gain her sympathy. Also in the movie, but with a disappointingly small part, is Marie Windsor, as Edna, Tucker's wife; in a longer, more commercial, film, her role of femme fatale would almost certainly have been expanded.But it is the sets, location work, cinematography and editing which lift the film above the average. Practically every scene and shot has visual interest, and it is definitely one film you want to go on longer than its allotted 80 minutes.

But it is so much deeper than that. The very bleak message I got from the film is that even decent people must submit to corruption to survive.The character of Leo, superbly played by Thomas Gomez, is inherently honest and noble but he must live and work in the naturally shady numbers racket. He knows that he will be eventually crushed. This knowledge makes Leo one of the most bitter and tragic characters in film...a decent man whose life is dominated by futility.The protagonist of the film, portrayed by John Garfield, is Leo's brother. He has ridden his job as a sleazy mob lawyer to a life of fame and ease. He has everything Leo doesn't. Yet despite his blustery banter, he,too,is uneasy with his position. He knows Leo is headed for disaster and pulls all the strings he can to protect him, even though Leo reacts to him with contempt. Their relationship is doomed by the corrupt methods both use to survive. Garfield's character finds redemption of a sort by the film's end but not before inevitable tragedy has struck.There are many more levels to this complex film and discussion of them all could fill many pages. Above all, it is a beautiful movie,expertly directed with tremendous black and white imagery. The dialogue combines snappy patter with almost poetic sensibility. And the performances of all concerned are top notch. This is truly a treasure of cinematic art.

He took it a step further by resurrecting the film from the vaults and teaching it at NYU in the late 60's.  He said it was the first film he ever saw that related to a world he knew and saw.  Indeed, the film's realism and location shooting is great to see, especially Wall Street circa 1948.  Those scrapers have stood for a long time. This is not traditional noir, however.  It is an excellent study of a personal battle between two brothers.  Joe (John Garfield) is a rich, corrupt mob lawyer, not unlike Duvall in the Godfather flicks.  His older brother Leo (A great actor named Thomas Gomez) is a banker trying to live on the up and up.The relationship is a tragic one.  Thomas Gomez must be one of the most underrated actors of his day.  He steals every scene he's in with the quick-talking Garfield, who was so good in THE POSTMAN ALWAYS RINGS TWICE.  This may be familiar to fans of RAGING BULL, where both sets of brothers in two very different films love each other, but have a difficult time displaying affection.Two fabulous scenes stand out and would be impossible if shot in color.  The first occurs when Garfield stumbles upon a darkened office with his door slightly ajar. The light from his office cuts through the middle of the screen, allowing Garfield to snoop.  Another is the shootout at the film's climax, where all of the three shooters are lying in the shadows, creating suspense based on what we cannot see.  It is all done in a very impressionistic way, a superb use of lighting and shadow.  This is black and white at its best.  Pure and evil.  A truly great film.  I would stay focused on the scenes between Gomez and Garfield.  This sad brotherhood plays incredibly against a brilliant backdrop of crime and double-crossing.FORCE OF EVIL is another reminder of how good Hollywood films of the 1940's were.  Without them, we probably would not have the classics of the past 25 years.

This is true for director Abraham Polonsky. Had Polonsky not been blacklisted by the Hollywood and Congressional bigots who knows what he might have done. Certainly his earlier script for Body and Soul is one of the best in movie history. Since he was later blacklisted by the power hungry hooligans of the nation, it is easy to read too much Marxism and Communist psycho-babble into Force of Evil. In pointing out that there is not much difference between underworld numbers banking and banking in the world of acceptable business, Polonsky is utilizing social and political criticism, not of necessity a Marxist slant. Marxism is an entire Utopian recreation of the economic world order, not artistic expression and intellectual conceptualization as presented by Polonsky in Force of Evil. The director/writer is also concerned with moral bankruptcy in justifying evil as a means of rationalizing big profits from illegal activities.There is a spin off story concerning two brothers, one of whom has warped scruples who helped his younger brother become a successful if now corrupt corporate lawyer with no scruples until tempered by the seemingly innocent babe in the woods Doris Lowry (Beatrice Pearson) who in reality has questionable morals herself yet clothed in hypocrisy. Both Doris and Leo Morse (Thomas Gomez)are pursued by their own demons. The viewer has to determine where the moral depravity or evil actually lies and with whom. The title Force of Evil could just as well be THE Force of Evil, since evil tends to be almost omnipotent that every mortal is tempted and it takes very strong souls indeed to resist and remain true to heart. It's much easier to make a deal with the devil in the fashion of Faust and to take the wrong highway at the crossroads.The brilliant John Garfield who left this world much too soon never gave a poor performance. Only Garfield could have done justice to the complicated complex character of Joe Morse. Yet Thomas Gomez stays up with Garfield all the way and nearly steals the show as Joe's impenetrable sibling whose persona appears one-dimensional on the surface until one begins to scratch away the enamel.A delectable bonus for the viewer is the magnetic New York City photography that takes on the appearance of Edward Hopper paintings, as Polonsky intended. All the exterior shots are to be savored but one that sticks in the mind long after the film ends is near the final credits when Joe seeks where his brother Leo's body has been dumped. The narration by Joe tells it all as he runs in a desperate gait downward toward the murky water, with Doris trying to keep up but mainly just watching.One of the neglected movie gems of the 1940's, not to be missed.

Younger viewers, familiar with state lotteries may not appreciate the pervasive influence that was required to operate a nickel and dime play of individuals, that translated into millions that went to corrupt local politicians, judges, and police. One reviewer said the crime was petty which is true; but that makes the cost to the characters involved so tragic and cinematcally vivid. John Garfield acting is at its best as he portrays a person trying to balance ambition, romance and family loyalty. The minor characters are all nice people who found themselves caught in a dirty business that seemed harmless to everyone who played the numbers. This movie shows the real cost in personal terms. The writing, acting and direction of this movie excels any crime movie of this generation.

In it Scorsese says that this film was the first one that depicted a world he knew, growing up in New York City. Scorses was mesmerized by it as a kid and studied it frame by frame as when he grew up. He pays tribute to Force of Evil saying that you can see the influence of it Mean Streets, Raging Bull, and Goodfellas.Of course the fact that the film was shot totally on location in scintillating black and white noir in New York City, gave it a dimension that no other noir films have, save possibly Night and the City which was also shot on location in London.John Garfield who was as quintessential a New Yorker as you could get plays Joe Morse, smooth lawyer for a big time racketeer Roy Roberts who is looking to either take over or muscle out the small time policy banks in the numbers racket. One of those banks is owned by Garfield's brother, Thomas Gomez.Garfield is as ruthless as Roberts, but with a velvet glove. He tries to get Gomez to go along with the syndicate, but Gomez balks. There's also a prosecutor looking into the numbers racket and a tapped phone which figures prominently in the climax.Given the leftwing polemics of both the star and director Abraham Polonsky, Force of Evil got the attention of the ultra rightwing House Un American Activities Committee. Polonsky was blacklisted for over 20 years and Garfield died under the strain of the investigation.Given what has happened to the Soviet Union, I wonder if Garfield and Polonsky were alive today what they would say and how they would feel about their work here. It's interesting to speculate.But as entertainment Force of Evil is a great success and that is the first rule of film. Also look for a good performance by Marie Windsor as Roberts's wife with a yen for Garfield. One of her first femme fatale roles and one of her best.

It belongs on the face of it to the post-war-disillusionment school of American thrillers (eg The Blue Dahlia, Key Largo), in which the evils that ordinary Joes spent the war fighting turn out to be business as usual when they get back home. But what makes it so unusual is its insistence, contrary to the message of other social-comment crime thrillers of the 1940s, that it's a bad system, rather than bad people, that's to blame for the woes of the world. The fate of Mob lawyer John Garfield's decent, kind-hearted brother Thomas Gomez, a small-time policy banker, shows us what happens to good people who try to play straight in a crooked game. If the bad guys in the film turned good, Polonsky implies, they'd only get the same. Polonsky described the source novel, Tucker's People, as an autopsy on capitalism.Sermon over none of the above gets in the way of a raging, doom-laden crime melo that, like a snowball, gets faster and weightier as it barrels along. Superb New York location photography, a vitriolic script, and committed, sincere performances lock our attention to every second of its 81 New York minutes. If it weren't for Gun Crazy (scripted under a front name by another dangerous pinko, Dalton Trumbo), Force of Evil would be the best film noir ever made.

Where his brother Leo, Thomas Gomez, has a small neighborhood numbers bank that gets wiped out on July 4th when the number 776 which was heavily bet comes out not by chance but by design. In a fix engineered by Joe's mobster client Ben Tucker, Roy Roberts, in an attempt to corner and take over the numbers business in the city. Joe being helpless to get Leo out of the numbers business before 776 hit because of a combination of Leo's honesty to pay off those who played the number at his establishment. Joe's affiliation with Tucker made it impossible for him to tell Leo the real reason for him to close up on July 4th without reviling Tucker's criminal activities. On the evening of July 4th all hell breaks loose with all the small numbers banks all over the city going bust by not being able to pay off those thousands who played number 776. Joe trying to get Leo back on his feet by getting him a job with the Tucker mob sees that Leo would rather be broke then be involved with organized crime. Leo cares more about the people who worked for him, who ended up broke and in jail, then himself making a lot more then he did when he was a small time numbers banker. With Leo wanting out of the business before he corrupts himself by working for the mob he's kidnapped by the Ficco gang, Tucker's muscle men. Leo's accountant Freddie Bauer, Howard Chamberlain, is later murdered because not only didn't want out like Leo but could identify those who kidnapped Leo as well. Joe drunk and depressed, over what is happening to Leo, at a local nightclub with Leo's secretary Doris Lowry, Beatrice Pearson, sees the news of Leo's kidnapping and Bauer's murder in the newspaper and rushes to Tucker's office. Finding Tucker there with his gangster partner Bill Ficco, Paul Fix, Joe tries to get his brother Leo released by the Ficco mob. It's then that Joe finds out that Leo died of a heart attack and was dumped on the rocks under the Washington Bridge.In an explosive and emotional moment Joe secretly lifts up a phone in Tucker's cabinet drawer, that Joe knows is being tapped by the DA's office. Joe knowing that it's all over between him and Tucker gets, by inciting, both him and Ficco to spill the beans about their criminal operations, as well as Ficco's kidnapping and later death of Leo. When Tucker and Ficco are shown the activated phone by Joe the lights go out and there's a shootout where both Tucker and Ficco end up getting shot and killed by Joe. Taking off with Doris to the Washington Bridge Joe find Leo's body lying on the rocks.Sad and emotional ending with Joe and Doris finding Leo's body and later, as the movie ends, Joe going to the DA to tell all he knows about the life of crime that he led defending hoods like Tucker that cost Leo's life. Both powerful and touching movie about good and evil that was so ahead of it's time in how the force of evil destroys the lives of those who embrace it. That even now almost sixty years after it's release Force of Evil still packs the same wallop as it did back in 1948.

Polonsky barely hid the real undercurrent of this remarkable film. When it finally hit the VHS bins, I was almost first on line. I agree with all of the positive remarks on this strong movie, that has all kinds of ghostly memories hovering over it. I did indeed develop a strong crush on Beatrice Pearson, who was an established Broadway actress. She later did quite a turnaround, and even more effective role in LOST BOUNDARIES with excellent work alongside Mel Ferrer, Susan Douglas, Richard Hylton and Carleton Carpenter. From what I have read (if it is to be believed), she was difficult with a friend around offering advice at every turn. Pearson, after BOUNDARIES, returned to Broadway. Wherever she is now may be a mystery, but if she ever reads this, I hope she knows that this is one fan who still smiles at thoughts of her hair falling over the side of her face, her lovely smile, and the sight of her sitting atop a high hall mantle.

It has been called the saddest music ever written and you hear it in a version for string orchestra, but it seems to be original Beethoven and not David Raksin using themes.The music starts low in a night scene in a basement restaurant, where the frightened bookkeeper Bauer has agreed to lure Gomez into a meeting with some rival gangsters. Bauer sits at his table alone, one of the killers at another table, Bauer quarrels with the waiter, Bauer nervously drinks another glass of water, Gomez arrives, tries to talk sense to Bauer, then talks about dying himself, everything erupts in violence and over it all flows Beethoven's op. 131, giving the whole scene an unreal fatalistic atmosphere.Classical music has been used later to similar effects by Pasolini in the 60s, but this must be a very early and strange example.

Polonsky had a background of involvement in left wing politics and this movie was generally seen as an allegorical attack on the corrupting nature of capitalism. He later refused to testify before the House Un-American Activities Committee in 1951 and as a result was blacklisted by Hollywood for many years.The characters in Force Of Evil are all linked by their involvement in the numbers racket and together exemplify the types of morally compromised and deluded behaviour which is routinely used to justify their unethical or criminal activities. Their actions are mostly motivated by their own self interest and a quest for personal gain.At the heart of the organisation, Joe Morse (John Garfield) is the very confident and successful New York lawyer who's working for gangster Ben Tucker (Roy Roberts). Morse is very close to becoming a millionaire and together with Tucker is involved in a scam which will ensure that all the small operators who run the numbers banks in the city will be bankrupted thus clearing the way for Tucker's syndicate to move in and buy them all out. Morse is certain that negotiations for the racket to be legalised will be successful and that the syndicate and he will profit greatly as a consequence.Leo Morse (Thomas Gomez), Joe's older brother who made great personal sacrifices to enable Joe to follow his ambition to become a lawyer, operates one of the numbers banks and sees himself as a legitimate businessman. He's a caring employer who's concerned about the welfare of his staff and indignantly refuses an offer from Joe to join Tucker's syndicate. Joe uses persuasion, and when that fails, a more direct course of action to attempt to prevent Leo from being bankrupted. All his efforts fail because of Leo's determination not to be involved with unscrupulous gangsters and also his desire to treat his own clients in a manner which he considers to be ethical.Doris Lowry (Beatrice Pearson) is Leo's naive secretary who he treats like a daughter and who decides to quit her job because, after hearing the exchanges between the two brothers, she suddenly realises that she's involved in an illegal business. When Leo's bank is taken over by Tucker's men, Freddie Bauer (Howland Chamberlain) who is Leo's bookkeeper also wants to quit but is dissuaded from doing so when he is told that if he does leave, he'll be killed.Joe benefited greatly from his brother's actions in earlier life but now Leo's recalcitrance leads Joe to take ever greater risks to try to protect him from financial ruin and the dangers of not complying with the demands of the syndicate. Joe's original self assurance and boldness are gradually eroded as he begins to feel increasingly haunted by guilt and self doubt and his judgement is also affected when he takes action which exposes him to criminal prosecution. Joe's principles have been compromised and in a similar fashion Leo changes his mind and agrees to take a role in Tucker's organisation after his own bank is bankrupted.Doris who left Leo's employment because she didn't want to be involved in anything criminal develops a friendship with Joe who wins her over with flowers, an offer of a job paying $100 a week (instead of the $35 she'd been earning with Leo) and some soul baring conversations about ambition, guilt and human nature. She's obviously also become attracted by the elements of roguishness and danger associated with him. Clearly, by her actions, not only did she fail to reciprocate Leo's loyalty and kindness but also she ditched her scruples about being connected with criminality and was readily bought off by the $100 a week job.Freddie Bauer who is driven by fear and a need for revenge responds to threats against his life by becoming an informer. Whilst this is a means of striking back at the syndicate, it also constitutes a betrayal of Leo's loyalty and trust in him and in an even more extreme act of betrayal Bauer goes on to set Leo up for a meeting which leads to him being kidnapped.Joe's feelings of guilt and despair worsen and continue until ultimately, he also feels compelled to take a course of action which is also motivated by a need for revenge against Tucker and his new business partner.John Garfield's performance is excellent and Pearson and Chamberlain are also good in their support roles. Thomas Gomez's masterful characterisation of the perpetually harassed and stressed looking Leo who constantly lives under the threat of another heart attack, is exceptional and absolutely convincing.Force Of Evil is a bleak, intelligent and thoroughly absorbing drama which illustrates various circumstances under which people readily rationalise behaviour which they know to be wrong in the same way that they compromise their standards and principles whenever they feel there is something to be gained from so doing. The story also charts the harsh and steady decline of Joe, Leo and Freddie Bauer and also the moral decline of Doris. Although the movie was constructed as an illustration of the corrupting influence of capitalism, it is undeniable that it also illustrates profound observations on human interaction generally (in any structured environment) and the types of dilemmas which individuals in all organisations routinely have to confront and navigate their way through.

This is Wall Street, Joe tells us at the start of Force of Evil, and today was important because tomorrow, July Fourth, I intended to make my first million dollars. An exciting day in any man's life. Temporarily, the enterprise was slightly illegal. You see, I was the lawyer for the numbers racket. Joe has a problem. His older brother, Leo (Thomas Gomez), runs a neighborhood numbers operation. Leo is a decent small-timer with a bad heart who worked his tail off so that Joe could go to law school. He knows his brother for what Joe is, a slick legal crook. Joe is in partnership with a tough gangster, Ben Tucker. They plan to break the banks of the small numbers operations, then move in and consolidate them under their own hand. They'll make millions. Joe realizes his brother will be ruined and tries to save him. Events begin to spin out of Joe's ability to control them. Joe finally finds a conscience, but only after people die. There are a lot of elements that work in this movie. The screenplay by Abraham Polonsky and Ira Wolfert centers squarely on Joe's character and his dilemma. There's no let-up for Joe as his life of legal crime slides into real crime and tightens around him. The script is not exactly poetic, that would make it self-conscious, but it is tough, thoughtful and vivid. Polonsky's direction packs a lot of action into only 82 minutes. You need to pay attention, but it all makes sense. The movie looks gritty and bleak, from the crummy apartment where Leo runs his numbers operation to the empty New York streets at dawn to the sad but redemptive scene on the banks of the East River under the bridge. There are lots of low-angle shots that emphasize the essential emptiness of Joe's character. The movie also is well cast. Some of the actors I particularly enjoyed are Howland Chamberlain as a frightened, weak numbers accountant; Paul McVey as Joe's experienced law partner; Roy Roberts as Joe's business associate, Ben Tucker, a gangster who is more ruthless than Joe thought; and Marie Windsor in a small but memorable performance as Tucker's slow-talking, smoldering wife. More than anything, the movie depends on the excellent performances of John Garfield and Thomas Gomez. Gomez has to play a sick, excitable, overweight small-time crook who has a bedrock decency. The money I made in this rotten business is no good for me, Joe. he says. I don't want it back. And Tucker's money is no good either. Joe just looks at him. The money has no moral opinions, he tells Leo. Leo stares at his brother. I find I have, Joe. I find I have. Gomez has to show his complete disdain for what his brother has become but still show us there's some strength left in the relationship. Garfield is the center of the movie. He was an actor who looked tough and sounded tough, yet he was able in his movies to show enough vulnerability not to alienate the audience. He not only had a lot of charm when he wanted to show it, he knew his craft and was good at it. The movie also is resonant because we know what happened to Polonsky and Garfield as a result of the Communist witch hunts that overtook Hollywood during the late Forties and Fifties. Polonsky was an outspoken and enthusiastic Marxist. It's no accident that Force of Evil can be seen as a parable for Big Business squeezing out the hard-working little guys. When Polonsky refused to testify before the House un-American Activities Committee, his career vanished. He continued to write screenplays but only under assumed names. It took 21 years before he was permitted to direct another film. Garfield suffered perhaps a sadder fate. He came from a poor, working class background and had always been a strong supporter of the working man. He'd never been a Communist but he had supported liberal causes. Garfield was as politically naive as a deer who has a target tattooed on his side. He agreed to testify before HUAC but refused to offer any names of people the committee wanted to know were Communist sympathizers. He was unofficially blacklisted. He had become a major star in the Forties, but the job offers suddenly dried up. He made a couple of so-so movies, then tried to re-establish himself on Broadway. He was mystified and depressed at what was happening to him. He died of a heart attack in 1952 at 39.

The motion picture was well directed by Abraham Polonsky and it was selected to the National Film Registry, Library of Congress, in 1994 . Director Polonski was removed from the credits for a time after release, due to the blacklisting of supposed Communist sympathizers at the time . Polonsky was named as a member of the Communist Party by Hollywood 10 member Edward Dmytryk in Dmytryk's 1951 testimony before the House Un-American Activities Committee , when the blacklisted director named names to revive his Hollywood career and effect a return from exile in Europe . After being named by former fellow O.S.S. member Sterling Hayden, Polonsky himself was arraigned before HUAC in 1951 . He was blacklisted and went into exile . As director and screenwriter , Polonsky was an auteur of three of the great film Noirs made in the last century Body and soul (1947) screenplay , directed by fellow CPUSA member Robert Rossen, who kept his career by naming names , Force of evil (1948) which he wrote and directed , and Odds against tomorrow (1959) which he wrote using a front . Blacklisted after his uncooperative appearance before HUAC in April 1951, Polonsky did not get a chance to direct another film until 1968, when he helmed the production of the revisionist Western Tell them Willie Boy is here (1969), which he turned into an indictment of genocide . It wasn't until 1968 that he was credited on a film, for the screenplay for Don Siegel's exegesis of police corruption, Madigan (1968). Polonsky has a short career and after the release of the well-reviewed Willie Boy, he helmed his last failed picture , the more light-hearted Romance of a horse thief (1971).

This is tragic, because both men were developing their art in the same way, and it would have been wonderful to see the two juxtaposed, such as we enjoy doing with the likes of Ford and Hawks or Lean and Powell.Please notice the music, cutting and composition of Force of Evil. They all eschew overwrought Korngold/Steiner-type sound and cardboad interior sets for hard, freeform music, severe inner-city exteriors and gritty, unsparing composition, which would reach their most developed under Kazan. There is an incredible scene towards the end, in which one character is bumped off and another kidnapped. It will leave you breathless.As for John Garfield, well, for a film which bridges two eras, who else but Garfield, who does the same?  Two other standouts  the riveting Vincent Gomez as Garfield's brother and Beatrice Pearson, the etherially beautiful stage actress, in one of only two movies she ever made.The post World War II era is considered a watershed in the history of American cinema.

Visually, the compositions are exciting, from the elegant decor gilding the halls of power to the closeup of horror that punctuates Bower's brutal murder, the rich complexity seldom falters. There are echoes here of Eisenstein, and one can't help noticing the presence of Robert Aldrich as Assistant Director, an apprenticeship that would payoff in the visually similar Kiss Me Deadly, suggesting that Aldrich served for a time as trustee of the blacklisted Polonsky estate. The script occasionally rises to the level of poetic Blank Verse, and is expertly intoned by John Garfield, Beatrice Pearson, and Thomas Gomez in a sweatily memorable performance.Thematically, Marxist Polonsky and co-scripter Ira Wolfert take a shot at the Darwinist world of capital, where big fish survive by eating smaller fish or by muscling in on the catch (Ficco's strategy), while working class minnows offer up dimes and quarters in hopes of instant metamorphosis. It's an ugly world where corruption and greed reach from top to bottom. Since the Production Code of the time couldn't leave matters in an unregenerate state, an upbeat ending is tacked on that defies the logic of what has gone before. Nevertheless, the sharply-etched images remain, vividly - memorably. And it's ironic that any intended remake will have to consider that the biggest fish of all has taken over the numbers racket and renamed it - the State Lottery. I wonder if Polonsky was amused.

Now black-suited devil's advocate Joe is acting as older brother to Leo, offering him a step up the ladder from his skid-row office to manager of thirteen 'banks', or number rackets, in the New York area. But Leo wants out even though he can't deny that he got his little brother through law college on the scraps of dirty money from the same piles of dough he's offering him now. The nosiness of a city hall litigator called Hall may have something to do with his reluctance to climb the ladder with his brother. On the other hand, there is the angelic young teller Doris Lowry who only worked for the bank to feed her family. She wants out too. Joe has to fight for the approval of his 'older brother' Ben Tucker and his wife Edna (a femme fatale of sorts) as well as that of his older brother Leo and femme vivante Doris.As a man who has never read the Bible, I can still relate to the tragic outcome of Joe and Leo's fraternal conflict. Polonsky's street knowledge and George Barnes' Edward Hopper-influenced photography really take advantage of an isolated Wall Street (how they swung that I do not know) in which John Garfield's unusually white-suited Joe walks out from under the hand of George Washington and into the morning light beyond a church tower. Redemption is what he's seeking, in the arms of Doris.As a capitalist, I can also watch this movie and still enjoy it as it lays on Polonsky's left-wing rhetoric quite lightly, unlike more recent heavyhanded Hollywood propaganda. Innocent people aren't punished in this picture, only the ones who knowingly got involved in the 'numbers racket' are (ergo Leo and Freddie Bauer). The numbers racket will essentially break the bankers and force them to be bailed out by Tucker's Corporation. As one character says, What do you mean gangsters? This is business! Something quite relevant to our times, many would agree.Unusually for a film noir of it's time, 'Force of Evil' doesn't end with a shot of the cuffs being snapped on Garfield's wrists or the bulb going on and off for the electric chair -he awaits his jailers peaceably, aware of his bad deeds, instead of shooting it out with the world as in most gangster pictures. Nor is the femme fatale a major presence.Characters' worth in the picture is really merited on their expediency, not on their goodness as we find out in the end when the short-lived dispute between Tucker and his old Prohibition partner Ficco boils over to Leo who dies even when he's breathing and his weary bookkeeper Bauer in a memorably hardboiled sequence. World-weary numbers man Leo is found on the rocks... by the river... like an old dirty rag nobody wants but Joe wasn't expedient enough to be played by the Corporation and gets out. As the testing Edna Tucker might have said, You're not strong or weak enough.

It stars John Garfield, Thomas Gomez, Beatrice Pearson, Marie Windsor, Howard Chamberlain and Roy Roberts. Music is by David Raksin and cinematography by George Barnes. Plot finds Garfield as lawyer Joe Morse, who works for powerful gangster Ben Tucker (Roberts). Tucker has a plan to control all of the numbers rackets in New York, something that with the fix on the numbers up and coming for the 4th July, will see all of the smaller number rackets go bust. This is a problem for Morse because his big brother Leo (Gomez), is one such operator, an honest good guy who did everything he could to ensure that Joe had a proper start in life. It has come to be regarded as an influential and important movie in the film noir pantheon. Big critics, big film makers and film noir aficionados, all have queued up to salute Polonsky's film. If it's worthy of such elegant praise will always be debatable, but film does have a uniqueness about it, using stylised dialogue passages and in opening up a corrupt and socially bankrupt can of worms for the cinema loving world, Polonsky has crafted a thematically potent 1940's crime picture. The exchanges between Garfield and love interest Pearson, have an almost poetic flow to them, this in a film that for most of its running time shows that badness can not be beaten, or at best that it can't be railed against or broken away from so easily. While the biblical tones, both allusions and allegorically speaking, also give the picture some added power. Though mostly talky in the main, it does burst into shocking violence for its final quarter, with a finale that contains distress segueing into the possibility of spiritual regeneration&#x85;..or maybe that, too, will prove futile? Added to the biting narrative are great cast performances and evocative music scoring, and with skilled location photography adding authenticity, it's not hard to see why it has come to be so revered.

About the rhythm of the speech--or the rythmlessness, more like.  There was much talk.  The talk started the instant the credits stopped, fast talk, the actors talking fast to cram in all those words.  The speech became a drone.  It became white noise, ambience.  Within ten minutes I was struggling not to go into a trance.  Within fifteen minutes I gave in; I just stared at the pictures as the speech washed over me, like a nice cotton fluff swabbing of the brain.  I may as well have watched with the sound off.  The plot was lost to me.  There were characters, and they talked, and they did things, and I have no idea who they were, what they were talking about, or what they were doing, but I stared at them.  It wasn't that I was tired or bored, just mesmerized by the drone.  I may have been better off watching with the sound off, or with the voices dubbed into French or some other language I don't understand, and reading English subtitles.  At least then I would have been active and engaged.I stared at the pictures.  Some of them were nice.  I like black and white movies to be very black and white, and this was, for the most part, although, like one other reviewer pointed out, there were a lot of grey interiors that were rather drab.  The exterior New York scenes were few but good--Wall Street, the bridge, the lighthouse, the dead guy lying in the rocks who looked like a rock.  There was a darkly lit room and a woman in a black dress with long black gloves that stretched up past her elbows, and a snatch of very white upper arms, and white curtains billowing in the background.  That was nice.  I liked the part in the restaurant with the silhouettes on the wall, a man smoking, and another man doing weird things with his fingers, like abstract finger puppets.  There were lots of subtle nice camera movements, usually flowing from one set of characters talking to another set of characters talking.  I liked the one where the camera floated over a crowd scene and followed one character moving through the crowd, and the camera must have been suspended by a wire, or was placed at the end of a very long crane, or maybe on a catwalk, or something.  It was very graceful, and I don't remember there being much talking in that scene, for once.I liked the geometry of the character placement in a lot of the scenes (although not as much as in Anatomy of a Murder, which had really good human geometry.)  There was a shot of three people standing in a kind of a triangle talking, and one of them slowly moved back, and then suddenly the camera blurted to the right a bit, and a fourth character was birthed on to the screen and they were all standing there in a  parallelogram.  That was good.After reading the other mostly very eloquent reviews on this site, I really wish I'd been able to follow the plot, because it sounds interesting now.  I wish I'd taped the film.  I was going to vote it a 4/10, but now I think I won't vote for it at all until I have a chance to see it again and hopefully not fall into a trance.

The film then goes on to show the relationship between Joe and his estranged brother Leo (Thomas Gomez) who happens to run one of these rackets.A noir like no other, directed and co-written by Abraham Polonsky whose career was completely destroyed because of the blacklisting in the 1950's. Polonsky's career never did recover and he next worked in the film Industry twenty years later. The film will be remembered for its poetic dialogue written by Polonsky who based the screenplay on the novel Tucker's People by Ira Wolfert who also receives a writing credit. The dialogue has a singsongy feel to it brilliantly delivered by the actors most notably during the heated exchanges between Joe and Leo. John Garfield excels, playing a determined man who will do anything to reach his goal except crossing over the only man who helped him become what he is today, his brother Leo played to perfection by Thomas Gomez. Largely classified as a B gangster picture in America, it was lauded in Europe and has since been reevaluated as a classic of the genre and as an American masterpiece as seen when it was preserved in the United States National Film Registry in 1994.

Joe's elder brother Leo runs one of these numbers banks, so Joe feels compelled to warn him of the situation which in turn puts him in an extremely compromised position.Under the surface, Force of Evil was an allegory of the corrupting nature of capitalism. All of the characters go thorough moral dilemmas and change their positions due to the possibilities of monetary gain. The way that big business works in a very underhand and amoral way in this film was meant as a comment on how actual business practises in post-war America could often be somewhat nefarious. The movie itself was not successful at the time. It may have been because of these themes but it might simply have been that this was a pretty complex movie that doesn't have clear heroes or villains. This very ambiguity has made it more cherished as the years have gone by but most probably contributed to it not being box office dynamite at the time. Force of Evil has, therefore, gone on to become one of the cult movies of film-noir.The acting and script are very good. But so is the look. There is some great New York location photography, particularly in the final third. While good expressionist use is made of light and shade. So, in summary, this is a serious-minded film-noir with a well crafted aesthetic.

There's some love interest for Garfield, new face Beatrice Pearson, effective as Garfield's brother's young ward, falls for Garfield's looks and tough charm, her innocence and morality contrasted with Mr Big Stuff Tucker's wife who attempts to use her more worldly wiles to ensnare Garfield in her own designs.The story races along, punctuated by some superb camera set-ups, some of the city-scapes especially memorable, equally sharp dialogue and some abrasive for its time, on-screen violence - Bauer for example meets his end by getting shot point-blank in the face.In summary, a densely plotted, brilliantly characterised noir which smacks of low-life realism throughout.

The film tells the story of a lawyer, Joe Morse (Garfield), working for a powerful gangster, Tucker, who wishes to consolidate and control the number racket in New York when everybody around him wants to quit it before it gets violent. Joe Morse to be the very best, has to step on a few familiar faces to take control. One of which is a smaller number racket by Morse's older brother Leo Morse. He's willing to snitch on his friends and family if it takes him to the top. The movie is full of messages about the different between good and bad, and also have frequent biblical allusions ranging from Abel & Cain, Juda's betrayal and stigmata. It's a great poetic, literary speech that Abraham Polonsky & Ira Wolfert wrote in Force of Evil. The dialogue is rich and ornate that it resembles a modern urban verse play.The lines are catchy. Most of the speeches is lush, incantatory in its repetitive rhythms, and plays like a soliloquy. He wrote with a fatalistic moral vision, a view of a world filled with kaleidoscopically complex nuances & ironies. The story arc is almost allegorical, interpretation keeps intruding on the tougher elements of the plot. This factor adds no distinction and only makes the going tougher. Garfield, as to be expected, comes through with a performance that gets everything out of the material furnished. Unburdening himself of conflicted feelings about his own corruption, Joe Morse plays a syndicate lawyer, but secretly brutal. With each bad intention, he intellectual reexamining the premises of his life more and more. A great film noir that uses the numbers racket as a metaphor for the pervasive corruption in life. Polonsky makes elaborate form of dialogue that plays in a way, that it's sounds like confessional meditation on morality. What's great in Force of Evil is just the fact that not all gangsters talk like a thug. Also to note in this terse, melodramatic thriller is the realist location photography. The New York locale shots give authenticity. Great use of shadows, and classical music. Check it out if a huge fan of film noir. It's one of the better ones.

A sort of John Gotti of his day, the Dutchman loved the limelight and portrayed himself as a public benefactor instead of the sadistic skinflint he really was.Yet with all his eccentricities, Schultz was the first to see that the dimes and nickels poor people bet on the Numbers could add up to millions a year if properly organized. When several of the Harlem Numbers bankers couldn't pay off the winners and turned to Schultz for a bailout, Schultz provided the financing but took over the banks, and most of the profits, wisely leaving the street-level organizations with their controllers and runners intact, just as in the movie.And just as in the movie, Schultz employed an accountant, one Otto Berman, said to be a mathematical genius, to fix the winning Number by placing a bet at the racetrack just as betting closed so as to throw the handle off a heavily bet number.In 1943, long after Schultz had been killed in a mob rubout, sports writer and war correspondent Ira Wolfert wrote a novel loosely based on the crime career of Dutch Schultz. Wolfert also collaborated on the screenplay of Force of Evil which was based on a part of that book. Wolfert undoubtedly is responsible for the strikingly clever tone of the narration and much of the dialog's eloquent yet realistic style.Are you telling me, a corporation lawyer, that you're running a legitimate business here? demands the protagonist of his numbers banker brother, in exasperation at his stubborn refusal to accept a mob takeover.This picture is 63 years old. An issue arises early on of remarkable relevance today how close a mob lawyer can get to his clients before the law treats him not as legal counsel but as a participant in the criminal enterprise. Lawyers are nor protected from the law, as one character succinctly puts it.When attorney Bruce Cutler was disqualified from representing John Gotti on just those grounds, Gotti's lucky charm deserted him and the former Teflon Don died in a Federal prison.John Garfield was a fast talker and he never lost nor tried to hide his Lower East Side accent. Yet because he had stage experience every word of every line is understood. He did not mumble or swallow his words--so different from some of the so-called movie stars of today. Accordingly the former slum kid and inmate in reform school John Garfield is believable in perhaps the only role of his short film career where he wears a finely tailored suit, compete with vest and watch chain in the style of the time.

A rival gangster turns up wanting a share of the spoils from this particular scam and as a result of a killing and a kidnap, and phones being tapped by the prosecutor's department, the whole set-up is brought before a court.This is a boy's film about gangsters and it can get pretty confusing if you don't pay attention throughout. The female roles are irrelevant to the plot which is a shame in the case of Marie Windsor who plays Mrs Tucker. She is the best of the cast in her scenes and she completely outshines the rather feeble and bland Beatrice Pearson who plays Doris. I also found the love interest between John Garfield and Peatrice Pearson difficult to believe. The acting is generally good with Thomas Gomez also deserving a mention. I didn't like him at the beginning but he managed to change my opinion so that I was sympathetic to him towards the end.In fact, the end section of the film is the most memorable with several good scenes including a set-up in a cafe, a confrontation between the main bad guys, clever use of the telephone bugging operation and a discovery on some rocks under a pier. Unfortunately, I lost interest in the film whenever Beatrice Pearson was on screen, which seemed like way too much, and the story can get confusing, so the film loses points on those accounts.It's a film that has a message similar to On The Waterfront in saying that the only way to topple powerful gang cartels is to stand up to them legally.

He's a great understated actor, sympathetic, gentle, and not quite the right man for this role as a sharp, ultimately cruel lawyer named Joe Morse in a sprawling criminal enterprise. So in scene after scene, what could have had a film noir or gangster edge ends up strained in a more normal dramatic way. The script might be one of the problems--some forced metaphors about death, or canned lines that are too profound for their own good.But these are not the only problems here. The direction, I suppose, under Abraham Polonsky, is the reason it has an odd flow to it. (This is his only film of note.) Many decisions seem steadily mediocre, like having Morse do voiceovers that aren't quite styling enough to work as style and are a slow way of telling the events. Morse is connected with an overly sweet girl who isn't really his type and romance doesn't make sense. And there are some editing gaffes that don't help. Larger still, this is an impersonal plot, with no clear protagonist or antagonist, just a numbers racket that is being undermined by some unseen politicians and some gangsters who aren't quite sure what's going on (really--even Morse is lost).Beatrice Pearson plays Morse's girl, and it's sad to say she just can't act at the same level as Garfield, and many of the other bit actors. But Morse's brother played by Thomas Gomez is a strong and sympathetic type, and he pulls off several amazing scenes. The camera-work is smart and generally intense enough, with high or low angles at key points, if sometimes a little obvious. The city (Manhattan) is a good backdrop, giving it a very nice ambiance, both night and day.Well, the movie has an outsized reputation. The shining moments and dark moods and the better final twenty minutes don't make up for the general messiness on many levels.

At first, it seems to be the film's considerable artifice -- the freighted blank verse dialogue, the dark, ominously composed shots, the adroitly modulated score, the sudden eruptions of violence.  But cumulatively it becomes clear that we're responding not so much to artifice as artificiality -- the sense that writer-director Abraham Polansky is hovering just offscreen, pulling all the strings.It remains quite an achievement nonetheless.  A filial drama, it runs along the love/hate ties that bind brothers John Garfield and Thomas Gomez.  Gomez, 50 and ailing, runs a tenement policy bank that takes in nickels and dimes.  Young upstart Garfield rakes in tens of thousands as a Wall Street lawyer with connections to an underworld syndicate.  Just before the Fourth of July -- when the racket has been rigged to break the small-time operators by ensuring that the number 776 will hit -- Garfield's guilty conscience leads him into warning off his brother, triggering a catastrophic chain of events.Polansky doesn't bother to hide his Marxist-tinged world view.  It's one thing to depict the bosses of crime and finance as heartless louses, but it doesn't ring true to have the slum-dwellers and policy workers display their decency and dignity at every turn.  We know Marie Windsor is a Wicked Woman when she glides smoothly into the lights keeping her voice so low and silky we have to strain to catch what duplicity she's up to.  Garfield's signature torment reaches such a perfervid boil here that we wonder why he ended up on Wall Street, not a lamasary.Still, the melodrama crackles, and the cast plays to the hilt (this is Gomez' shining moment in the noir cycle -- not a lackey nor an ogre, he's a mensch at the crossroads).  Film noir emerged, at least in part, in response to a brutally fractured world.  Whatever messages the movies contained were implicit and often inchoate.  Force of Evil misreads the cycle's cool, suggestive style by mounting its arguments so schematically.  It's a swift and brutal work that reminds us to eat our peas once or twice too often.

Yep. That was certainly an unexpected and unusual twist to this particular tale.FOE starred one of my favourite actors of that era, John Garfield, who convincingly played Joe Morse, the ambitious and very greedy Wall Street lawyer.Morse eagerly joins forces with NYC mob boss, Ben Tucker, who's got big plans to completely bankrupt the city's small-time numbers racket and grab all of the profits and business for himself, and his pals.As fate would have it, Joe's older brother, Leo (one of the many small-time racketeers) is certain to take a big fall once Tucker's merger goes into action.Complete with your standard double-crosses (and a cornball romance, thrown in for good measure), FOE is a fairly solid 78 minutes of prime movie-making from post-WW2 Hollywood.Even though I have no real complaints about Garfield's no-nonsense portrayal of Joe Morse, the crooked lawyer with a heart of gold, I honestly think that this role would've been better played by Humphrey Bogart.This film abounds with plenty of impressive, b&w camera-work, all, of course, set within the hubbub of New York City.

A tough, bleak film noir shot through with gutter poetry, this is a film that has clawed its way to its rightful position as one of the very best gangster films ever made, with Martin Scorsese acknowledging the influence it has exerted on him and his films.The screenplay is by Polonsky and Ira Wolfert, based on the latter's novel, Tucker's People. The script is sharp as a hoodlum's knife, and the narration spoken by Garfield is written as though it were blank verse and the dialogue is very highly stylized which gives the film the feeling of a Shakespeare play. Radical stuff even today, the tale of near-Biblical proportions of the betrayal between brothers is a small masterpiece of amorality, guilt and finally a glimmer of redemption.John Garfield plays the lawyer of gangster Ben Tucker (Roberts) who seeks to consolidate and control the numbers racket in New York. However, Garfield's older brother, Tomas Gomez seeks to stay as a small time operator of the illegal lottery, thus causing friction between Garfield and his boss.With frequent allusions to the tale of Cain and Abel and a near Judas-like betrayal, Polonsky's direction is nothing short of beautiful, as is the photography by George Barnes. A scene in a coffee shop late at night, full of brooding and dread is an example of pure cinema. It is one of our greatest losses then, that Polonsky was blacklisted by Joseph McCarthy's House of Un-American Activities Committee and prevented from directing for over two decades. Acting, direction and photography seamlessly intertwine here to form one of the very great films of the forties.

Is greed good? Are they necessary? Are they evil? These and other questions aren't necessarily answered, as much as pondered in this tale of a lawyer hired by a numbers racket group and then being embroiled into their lifestyle and the inner schemes. In the beginning we see John Garfield as an amoral self-absorbed individual and his older brother, played by Thomas Gomez, as more of a moral, decent hard-working man, who still works in his own betting office, where people place their bets. Gomez brought Garfield up and sacrificed for him, and John appears to be ungrateful, now living like a king with no qualms about the money he earns and how he earns it. Money's money, isn't it? But, as this film noir progresses we are shown that things aren't all black and white, as a lottery ticket. We are allowed to see Garfield as human, with feelings and he is even given a love interest, who happens to find something to love about him. What seems like a dark example of a film noir really feels as a biblical-style tale of salvation for John Garfield's character, with the comparisons of brothers John and Thomas to Cain and Abel, and Jacob and Esau. Others may not see as deeply into it as I, but it is riveting and intense viewing, for all film noir buffs. The ending may perplex some, as it doesn't so much end as move to another chapter that's left to your imagination. But, as one of the more socially and culturally important film noirs ever made, Force of Evil is essential to all lovers of film. Entertaining, yes. But, maybe you can learn something, too.

Its not a naturalistic script, but rather very theatrical and stylized. For some it will take a few minutes to sink into this world, symbolic and dark, almost biblical. The final voice over of Garfield's is simply majestic. A great great film.Polansky was at this point a first time director, so the film is all the more remarkable. The HUAC witch hunts drove him out of the business, but this film remains almost archetypal; it is film noir, yet not much like the stuff from Siodmak or the Chandler adaptations, or Wilder or even Lang. It exists in an almost Brechtian landscape or ideas, while retaining some sense of that noir ethos of menace from the system.

The company had a distribution deal but the company they were working with went bankrupt and distribution had to be found elsewhere. The timing was perhaps not the best - Garfield would be dead in four years and the director/writer Abraham Polansky blacklisted. The company eventually died with only a few films made.Force of Evil is the story of two brothers, Joe and Leo - Joe is a shady lawyer and Leo is a shady businessman who runs a numbers bank. He wants nothing to do with Joe, whom he sees as the real crook of the family. He resents Joe for his success. Joe and his cronies are planning to rig the lottery so that when the number everyone has bet on hits, it bankrupts the smaller operations, thus making them ripe to be gathered up under one large concern. Joe doesn't want Leo to lose all his money, so he tries to warn him.This is a beautifully written film that is well acted and full of a tough, grimy New York atmosphere. Wonderful shots of Wall Street and a beautiful ending at the George Washington Bridge. Both Garfield and Thomas Gomez as the brothers give riveting performances. Gomez is sloppy and full of anger; he may be in a shady business, but he pays off on his customers' bets, and he gets by. Garfield is dapper, handsome, and mystified as to why his help isn't appreciated. He's both book and street smart, but he channeled his talents in the wrong direction looking for the kind of success the law-abiding world could never give him.Marie Windsor is on hand as the cool boss' wife who thinks that Joe could warm her up. Joe doesn't want her. Their scenes are electric.This is truly a no-miss and a film ahead of its time, the kind of thing that Scorcese would have made later on. It's a pity that Polansky's talent and Garfield's would be gone so quickly, one artistic death by blacklist and the other from a weak heart that couldn't withstand a real-life force of evil.

Everything about it is perfect, every camera angle, every frame, every bit of editing, every performance, the script, the direction, the music. Abe Polonsky, who wrote the screenplay and directed, was a genius. Some commentators have suggested that this film is political, presumably because of Polonsky's notorious politics which led to his being black-listed, but I can see nothing political in it whatever; it is purely a moral study. Beatrice Pearson, as the girl, is one of the most enchanting and luminous presences ever to grace the screen. Her performance is so subtle in its gradations of purity tempted by evil, that it deserved an Oscar. She conveys more by lowering and raising her eyes than most actresses could do with a thousand lines of dialogue. John Garfield gives his best of many brilliant performances. Possibly no other actor could have pulled off this complex role without sacrificing honesty, without ever once trying to make the audience love him. Garfield sacrificed his ego to be Joe Morse, mercilessly and nakedly. Garfield and Pearson are both richly multi-dimensional, and their scenes together are masterpieces, as perfectly composed as Botticelli paintings, and just as well executed. Polonsky's touch of leaving Beatrice sitting on a mantle is just one of many flashes of directorial genius. Dozens of lines of dialogue are unforgettable,and the script is so intelligent it borders on being a Platonic dialogue. Garfield and the sultry, alluring Marie Windsor are also magic together, with him oblivious of her irresistability, while she sizzles the screen with her sexual power, apparently effortlessly. This film probably also contains the best ever performance by Thomas Gomez, as Garfield's older brother. The deeper levels of this film are never far from sight, and it is one of the most brilliant studies of the corrupting power of evil ever committed to film. It is as searing in its search for the true hearts of men and women as any morality tale ever told. Nothing about it is contrived. It is honesty at its most searing, probing at its most corrosive, questioning at its most naked, a work of disturbing and unforgettable genius. Rembrandt could not paint shadows like that, nor could Vermeer reveal such gleams of light in the darkness, as are glimpsed from even one second of Beatrice Pearson's tentative, trembling, shimmering eyes when she smiles at John Garfield like a lost, hesitant doe in the wood.

He knows he's a crook but feels it is impossible to be honest under the present American system.  Every relationship is corrupted and the film carries a terrible weight of doom.

It became a cult film after Polonsky was blacklisted for refusing to testify before HUAC in 1950.  He didn't get his name on a film again until 1968 when he scripted Don Siegel's Madigan and 1969 when he directed the Robert Redford Western Tell Them Willie Boy is Here.

I'm 61 I was there and I lived through those years. The others theorize, I know. )That this film was a box office flop is not only predictable---it was inevitable. Noir as a style & theme with b.o. legs had a 3-year run, '45-'46-'47, the way horror films did '31-'32-'33. The film school professors have tried to blame forces of reactionary social repression---the Production Code in '33, HUAC in '48. These events were but tombstones for film cycles that had run out steam at the box office.In my time working in movie theaters (hardtop & drive-in) '60s-70s, I saw many cycles come and go, most in 3 years *Spaghetti westerns *Kung Fu *Biker *Drugs as cool *Trucker/hot car/backwoods *Blaxploitation *Euro heist That's the way the cookie crumbles in the movie biz; audiences are fickle. No more complicated than that.It is emblematic of the delusional university apparatus that the BUSINESS aspect of film-making---THE DOMINANT element---is ignored in books on film noir. After all, these characters not only have no private sector work history, they view business the same as FOE---*Capitalism is a racket*. That's not something Americans will pay to see, and MGM gave this film the big build-up I saw the '48 press-book.It is even more telling that that these professors, lefties all, only quote reviews and coverage in the generic press but NEVER EVER feature the trades--- publications catering to exhibitors such as Box office, MOTION PICTURE EXHIBITOR, MOTION PICTURE HERALD, etc. Coverage was from the theater operator's viewpoint---a world away from film school fantasists.These film school wackos only interview the creative types and NEVER the studio exec in charge of Exhibitor Relations---the man who reports to the top on b.o. performance. They NEVER interview the producers, as if these films somehow were made with money from Santa Claus. They never banked a box-office take or met a payroll or dealt with distributors---they never even ran a lemonade stand as kids.FOE was a flop because Americans of the post-WWII era took strong exception to those who believed to their last nerve that America would be better off as a Communist police state. Americans are funny that way we got rid of one tyranny in 1776 and weren't about to lie down for another. FOE is a fine production defeated by its view of American business as a criminal conspiracy--- putting the JG character's law firm on Wall Street is too crude, typical lefty device. And the sickeningly sanctimonious Beatrice Pearson character is typical Group Theater/1930s---the little people waif, a type which disfigured drama right into the 1960s. Many actors sank themselves with this type (Salome Jens comes to mind), even many major stars tried it on Natalie Wood, for instance.The blacklistees, their acolytes and the film-school nuts have tried to paint a picture of the blacklistees abrupt demise as the result of hysteria. That they'd say this shows how clueless they are, and remain, about the country of their birth.There was NO hysteria it was a foregone conclusion among wide-awake grown-ups that communism=enslavement, a view verified, abundantly, by the historical record. But they weren't hysterical about it---they pulled the plug on the Left and moved on without a backward glance or second thought.And what was there to think about? The equation was communism=death just as nazism=death, and Americans had had it with these police state isms. The U.S.A. had the body count to point to erasing the Nazis and weren't up for a rerun fighting another ism. Which they did anyway in Korea.So yeah, the lefties got stepped on, hard, and kicked to the curb, right into the gutter. It's the blacklistees who were hysterical---they'd hung themselves on a meat hook, HUAC just provided the footstool.FOE's star John Garfield, the finest actor of his generation committed seppukku at his HUAC hearing saying he wouldn't say anything about his friends. NOW HEAR THIS Political extremists have NO friends, only accomplices and co- conspirators. And J.G. had been snitched off by his good friends HUAC knew everything already anyway.All apolitical people, like me(70% of any population) know this---Political extremists at BOTH ends of the political spectrum, right OR left, meet in the SAME PLACE Secret police dungeons, barbed wire camps, mass graves. Only partisans of either ism see a difference, those of us outside the political nut ward see only bloody devastation. This was the future envisioned by the blacklistees---friendship had nothing to do with it.The blacklistees weren't believed because they simply weren't credible. They married a political philosophy that was nothing but lies and were caught out. They wanted it BOTH ways to live the Hollywood high life while slandering the nation that made it possible. OF COURSE America reacted with revulsion and rejected them, harshly.That the blacklistees are romanticized by the film school apparatus merely shows the enduring resilience of the leftist lie.My parents were party members, knew Garfield as Julie, and I grew up hearing them & their CP buddies spout the party line. I loved my mom & dad in life and more than ever since their death, in '83. I miss my parents terribly---every day. They gave me the internal resources to survive, endure and even triumph.
