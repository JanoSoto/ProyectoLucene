Apparently, some folks watched this flick and didn't get it. The movie is essentially a star turn for Murray, who's in almost every frame - and that's fine with me because he can carry a film. Trivial quibbles over the movie's name and reference to the original work, the lack of faithfulness to the book and other complaints miss the point of the project. While staging a production of 'A Christmas Carol,' a TV executive experiences the very same circumstances as one of the characters in the novel. That alone makes it work. A few reviews question the overall harsh tone of the movie, or more specifically, Murray's role. Frankly, I would not have minded had it been even a little darker. There's a lot of water to carry in that bucket of trying to measure the callous and thoughtless manner in which some folks act on all but the most treasured of holidays. Murray's demeanour boils it down into one strong mean spirit and evaporates it with a truly positive and well-wishing finale.Scrooged is, along with Groundhog Day, among his best work.

Then there are those who say that the end is sappy.  The ending is what I like the most.  And Murray's acting is much better than other Scrooges, who usually overact.  Murray manages to be over-the-top with his cruelty while still making his acting believable.  Cross is truly Scrooge-like, reveling in the death of an old woman caused by his commercial because it's free publicity.  Another common comment is that Carol Kane steals the scene as the Ghost of Christmas Present.  Not true.  The chemistry between Murray and Kane ensures that they share the screen perfectly.

Very funny. **** out of ****","Date":"18 December 1999","Score":"49 out of 72 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Drama, Fantasy","Review":"  SCROOGED (1988) ****Starring Bill Murray, Karen Allen, John Glover, John Forsythe, Bobcat Goldthwait, Carol Kane, David Johansen, and Alfre Woodard Director Richard Donner   Running time 101 minutes    Rated PG-13 (for violence, language, and sexual references)By Blake French	Scrooged is one of the top ten holiday comedies ever produced on the big screen. It enables a viewer to experience the true meaning of cinema to jump out of our lives and experience another. Once in a long, long while we get a movie with as much magically irrelevant context as Richard Donnar's 1988 adaptation of Charles Dickens classic fable. Scrooged holds a place on my list of the top 100 American movies ever made.	The film takes place a few days before Christmas. Bill Murray stars as the heartless  Frank Cross, a corporate tightwad in charge of a highly profitable television company. This man seldom gives raises,  airs stomach churning TV ads, and fires desperate employees at the drop of a hat, regardless of what time of year it is. Currently, Frank's company is producing the first live Christmas program on network television, on Christmas eve. It is a Charles Dickens fable. Frank is at the prime of his life, living a wealthy, glamorous, but unhappy life.	His greed soon catches up with him, however, when one night his old boss visits him, who has now been dead for years. Frank is at first astonished; he thinks he is hallucinating. The talking corpse tells him that  very soon he will be introduced to three ghosts involuntarily. Franks then calls his old girlfriend, and continues on with his deprived life.Bill Murray plays his role straight, with intensity and imagination--just like everyone else in the cast. He acts like he is yelling at his workers, and they act like they are being yelled at. This is what generates the film all of its laughs. It takes the characters seriously, and the comical situations in which they are placed are what makes the film funny.	Each of the three ghosts visit Frank. They include The Ghost of Christmas past, a rough cigar smoking taxi driver, an angelic but brutal pink fairy, the Ghost of Christmas Present, and the most feared ghost, Christmas Future, the death-resembling, dark capped figure. They each contribute a heartfelt, terrifying message to Frank, explaining to him how that he either needs to clean up his act and become a giving, generous man, or dastardly things will happen to him.   	The three ghosts are some of the most memorable characters ever seen in the movies. The human characters are also very interesting and entertaining. The filmmakers write each with distributive characteristics, provoking empathy and captivation. They are wonderfully portrayed as well.	The interlocking stories each related to each other in Richard Donnar's comedy classic as well. Each scene relates to the next with a strong, supportive narrative through line through Frank Cross.	''Scrooged'' definitely fits into the comedy genre, and offers copious amounts of laugh out loud material. There's even dialogue and sight gags that provoke laughter. On the other hand, the film doesn't lose track of its message by being all over the wall slapstick silliness. It leaves room for the emotions and feelings present. For this type of comedy to work, the humor needs to be played accurately. Some scenes involving the past of Frank are quite emotional, and the filmmakers use this to their advantage to develop the Frank character even further. ''Scrooged'' may be a spoof, but if still holds true to the classic story it is based on.	I also enjoyed the illustrious style this film uses a mesmerizing blend of perfect set direction and colorful atmosphere. The sound track is very effective as well, with memorable tunes and voiceless medleys.  The closing scene of ''Scrooged'' may feel a bit contrived and fake, but it also allows us to leave the theater with joyful happiness inside. If this film doesn't put you in the Christmas spirit, nothing will.Brought to you by Paramount Pictures.

Scrooged is a cinematic gem, one of the most outstanding films of the '80s or any time for that matter. Bill Murray is at his comedic best, and he is entirely convincing as a bitter network exec who has lost sight of the important things in his life, like family and friends. You know the Dickens story, but Richard Donner's film version breathes life into the story and gives it extra meaning for modern audiences. Supporting actors all do wonders with their roles, from Robert Mitchum to Carol Kane to Michael J. Pollard. This film will make you laugh, and will certainly bring a little warmth into your Christmas season.For those who sight this film as mean-spirited or dark, they surely must be missing something. This film is funny, charming, and sweet. Frightening and warm at the same time, Scrooged is a modern masterpiece that has been unjustly overlooked and unappreciated. While there are other enjoyable Christmas films of the '80s (A Christmas Story and Christmas Vacation seem to get more than enough praise), none can hold a light towards Scrooged, an excellent Christmas movie for modern audiences.

Signs inform us that it's Santa's workshop and we're at the North Pole. Inside, elves work hastily as Santa prepares himself for his impending duty on Christmas Eve night. But then, terrorists, packing some serious heat with them, lay siege to the workshop.Panicking, Santa, Mrs. Claus, and the elves run towards the back of the shop, open a tool cabinet, which reveals an arsenal of M-16s, and soon everybody's armed to the hilt with automatic weaponry. But then Lee Majors appears on a snowmobile and reassures Santa that Christmas will be coming on time this year. Then Lee goes to work killing the terrorists with a large Gatling gun.Then we're treated to a promo spot for a television production of Scrooge, which features a bloody highway shooting, a plane blowing up, and drug addicts taking heroin. It is this sort of cynicism that's underlying in much of the subtext of this film, and it's also something that Frank Cross (Bill Murray), the youngest television president in network history, thrives on.And so opens Scrooged, director Richard Donner's contemporary take on Charles Dickens's classic tale A Christmas Carol. Dickens's novel has been fodder for countless television, film, and stage productions over the 150+ years it has been an accepted part of American literature, and this 1988 dark comedy is the latest incarnation.The biggest reason it has is because it describes the need for mankind to not be so selfish, and it takes three ghastly apparitions over the course of a 24-hour period to show an old miser the error of his ways.But all of this is in the past. Cross is so swept up in himself, that he gives bath towels to everyone (even his only brother) on Christmas. He asks his loyal secretary Grace (Alfre Woodard) to stay late at work, despite the fact that she has to take her mute son to the doctor. (I care! Frank says, when she confronts him about it.) He fires an underling named Eliot (Bobcat Goldthwait) for questioning him about his un-Christmas-like promo ads. He shuns Claire (Karen Allen), the only woman who's ever cared about him when she tries to provide comfort for the homeless. Yeah, Cross is every bit as a unsavory as most misers are when it comes to A Christmas Carol.But life is about to change for Frank, and that's marked by the sudden and (literally) explosive appearance of the rotting corpse of his late boss. The walking, talking worm feast informs Frank that he's going to be visited by three ghosts over the next 24 hours, and this may be his last chance to change his ways. And from there on, it's ghastly, darkly comic hilarity as Frank goes back, forward, and stays in the present as three ghosts (a manic cabbie, a jilted, abusive fairy, and a towering, cloaked skeleton, respectively) take him on a wild ride through his life.Bill Murray is at his comic best here, getting Scrooged the way someone in his position should. Much like the lead character in A Christmas Carol realizes the error of his ways, Frank Cross does so too, but with a kind of cynicism that could only be provided by someone as indifferent, uncompromising, and selfish as him. And he's also quite aware from the appearance of the first ghost of what this trip entails.The makeup and special effects are also worthy of some mention. The ghosts all look fantastic, even though some would argue that the effects that brought them to life are dated; well, this movie was made in 1988 for crying out loud!I liked Scrooged, as it is certainly a fantastic Christmas movie to watch, and is quite funny, especially just to see Murray get his comeuppance in a role that seems to suit him perfectly.Watch Bill Murray get Scrooged - 10/10 "},{"Title":"Starts well, gets a bit sentimental but Murray carries it","Date":"25 December 2003","Score":"18 out of 28 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Drama, Fantasy","Review":"  Francis Cross is a successful TV executive but at Christmas time he is about as miserable a man as you could wish to meet.  Forcing people to work over the holidays and unwilling to think of anyone but himself.  As Christmas Eve approaches Francis is visited by his dead boss, warning him to change his ways; when he doesn't he is visited by three ghosts who show him Christmas in the past, present and future.Each year there are plenty of versions of the classic Christmas Carol story, but this film is consistently one of the better ones.  It starts with a great dark comedy that sees some very imaginative gags (The Night The Reindeer Died) as well as Murray given great material.  At some point (roughly ghost 2), sentimentality starts to set in and the film doesn't quite have the edge on it that it did.  It still works - in fact, ghost 3 is not so much sentimental as really dramatic!What holds it all together though is a great performance from Murray.  He is funny throughout but also does the work to try and hold off the sentimentality of the piece - although it does come through, as one would expect with a Christmas movie!  The support cast is good and includes Woodard, Goldthwait, Goulet, Farr and Mitchum.  I didn't feel like Kane's Christmas Present really worked and didn't find her funny in the least. While the support cast add to the film, it is almost totally belonging to Bill Murray and the fact that it is so enjoyable is mostly due to him (although not even he can carry off the audience interaction over the end credits).Overall this is a good Christmas movie - it does give you a nice little festive glow but also has enough cynical edge to keep the syrup at bay for a certain amount of the time.  Regardless of everything else, Bill Murray is great in the lead and holds the movie together better than someone else may have been able to.

But somehow it isn't","Date":"2 May 2007","Score":"13 out of 22 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Drama, Fantasy","Review":" After Bill Murray struck gold with Ghostbusters in 1984, he dropped off the radar a little. His personal project The Razor's Edge flopped with audiences and critics, and I think that must have been a blow to him. Besides making a cameo in the amusing Little Shop of Horrors, he stayed away from the Hollywood circuit for four years.But then in 1988 he resurfaced with Scrooged, an update on the classic Charles Dickens tale. Obviously trying to repeat the success of Ghostbusters, Scrooged was a modest hit with audiences, who considered it Murray's comeback role.When I was younger, I loved Scrooged. I thought it was funny and delivered on so many levels. But as I've gotten older, Scrooged has gone down considerably in my estimation. Instead of feeling funny, it now feels laboured, and forced. And I never thought I would say this, but the main reason Scrooged doesn't work is because of Bill Murray.Bill Murray is one of my favourite comedians. In fact I think he's one of the funniest men alive. His dry, laconic outlook on life is nearly always hilarious. Just look at some of the gems he's turned out. Ghostbusters. Groundhog Day. Lost in Translation and the sadly overlooked Broken Flowers.But then there's Scrooged. A film that should have been a perfect vehicle for Murray's talents, but it never even gets out of the gate. And I blame that on Murray, sadly. He did the theme of a miser seeing the error of his ways to much greater effect in the absolutely wonderful Groundhog Day, which is my personal favourite comedy of the 90s.In Scrooged, Murray is the borderline power-mad TV exec Frank Cross. A man so consumed by greed and hate he thinks nothing of firing employees if they even look at him the wrong way. Frank is on a dangerous path, and will lose everything if he doesn't change his ways. And so step in the Ghosts of Christmas Past, Present and Future to show Frank what he's missed out on in life.There is some invention during the scenes of ghostly visitations. The Ghost of Christmas Past is a grizzled New York cab driver. The meter is actually a calender that shows the year Murray is in. The Ghost of Christmas Present (a horribly screechy performance by Carol Kane) is like an insane Sugar Plum Fairy with a nasty habit of punching Frank repeatedly. The Ghost of Christmas Future is just as Dickens left it. Except it has a TV for a face.Usually I like Christmas tales with dark centres, like the excellent Nightmare Before Christmas and the hilarious Gremlins. Two brilliant films that succeed on every level. But sadly, Scrooged doesn't deliver. Whenever Bill Murray is in a film, he's usually the best thing about it. Here he's the worst. He's clearly not having a good time. He approaches each scene with indifference. When he's hands on with material, he can deliver superb performances. But he's strictly hands off with this film. And as a result, it makes his supposed redemption in the final scenes that all the more false.There are occasions where his trademark sarcasm shines. I liked the scene where he collects an award for Humanitarian of the Year. Its funny because Murray is notorious for shunning the award ceremonies, and his clear distaste for the Oscars is mirrored in that scene. His acceptance speech is a marvellous send-up of the countless celebrities who stand up to the mike and drone on and on about their achievements.But elsewhere Scrooged falls flat. There is no evidence that Frank is slowly thawing. And because Murray overacts badly in this film (strange considering that he prefers minimalist acting), I couldn't believe for a second what I was seeing. Murray spends a lot of his time shouting his way through the film to the point that it becomes tedious.In the supporting cast, we do get some occasional rays of sunshine. John Glover is hilarious as the exec brought in to lighten the burden on Frank's shoulders, when really he's after his job. John Forsythe sports an astonishing makeup job as Frank's old boss, who appears as a decaying corpse, the film's version of Marley's Ghost. And the underrated Karen Allen shines as the woman Frank gave up for the sake of his career.But its in the final scenes where Scrooged comes crashing down. Frank has seen the error of his ways. And to prove it, he barges on to the set of a live retelling of A Christmas Carol the TV studio is putting on. Frank goes on and on (and on) about the true meaning of Christmas. And its a horrible thing to see. Murray doesn't sound like he believes a word of what he's saying. It seems to go on forever. And I felt really embarrassed for him.What a pity! Scrooged could have been a hip, witty deconstruction of A Christmas Carol. And nobody does nasty and sarcastic better than Bill Murray. Where did it all go wrong then? How did it so completely miss the mark? Shame considering it came from Richard Donner, the man behind classics like Superman and The Omen. And such a waste of Robert Mitchum and John Houseman.Very poor, and ultimately very depressing too.

From the very start of the film, we are treated to how unkind and selfish, Murrays character really is, yet we still cant bring ourselves to hate him.....even when he suggests to a prop man that he should STAPLE little plastic antlers to the heads of door-mice.Due to a very creepy encounter with his dead boss, Cross is warned that he will be visited by 3 ghosts, and so the story takes off, as he meets 3 very unusual ghosts with even weirder traits, such as the ghost of christmas present, who likes to randomly beat Cross up, every time he shows no heart. Best of all is the NOO YAWK talkin taxi driver, who i feel almost steals the show from Murray ....which is one of the hardest things in the world!!!Running throughout the film, is, ...sadly, a rather weak sub plot of Cross and his ex-lover, which , i love for all the wrong reasons.....but sadly, to people who have never seen the film, might find a bit tedious.But of course....its Murray who comes away from this looking cool, as , even though he has experienced some genuinely scary things ( the halucination of a waiter on fire is still creepy), we lap up his dead pan reactions to it all!!

Bill Mury is probably one of the funnier actors out there and the acting for this film was very nice. I enjoyed the twisted takes on the Christmas ghosts. The overall feel of the film also makes it a good Christmas piece. The only down side is that it is a bit slap sticky so it brings things down a little.Though not a masterpiece.

I have often found him to be an acquired taste, I mean don't get me wrong here, I'm a big fan and can repeatedly watch his best offerings, but it's not hard to understand why his style is not universally loved. Scrooged is pure and simply the modern spin of the story we all have grown up with, that isn't to say that the film loses anything as regards Christmas spirit, because it doesn't, the message is still the same, and in this ever changing world of ours the core essence of the story is one the world should heed.This version is a blast, it's loud, it's brash, but boy is it damn funny, and I personally watch it every Christmas without fail. And yes, I watch it alongside the glorious Alistair Sim version, for although they are poles apart in class, they both entertain for very different reasons.Joining Murray in this festive romp is the delightful Karen Allen, while luminaries such as former New York Dolls front man David Johansen and Mr. Laconic himself, Robert Mitchum, add some weight to the cast list. It all works really rather well with the exception of Carol Kane's Ghost Of Christmas Present, where to me she comes off as being more annoying than funny, but that of course is a personal opinion and I know as fact that many others adore her energetic performance. With quips aplenty and of course with a simple heartfelt message at the core, Scrooged is truly a sharp and enjoyable film to be enjoyed at the festive period.

However the general viewer feedback is good. The film has some sappy, overblown moments ie.- the ending. But its all done in good spirits. If your a Bill Murray fan you'll love it. As the morally redundant TV exec Frank Cross, Murray gets far and away the most screen time and his straight faced, dry humour is just perfect for this type of character.The film is a modern update of 'A Christmas Carol' for anyone who doesn't already know with the aforementioned Murray character Frank Cross replacing the role of Ebeneezer Scrooge. After being initially visited by his now deceased ex-boss(represented rather shockingly as an old decaying, mouse infested corpse still wearing the golf uniform he suffered his life ending heart attack in on the fairway) and on whom he had based his own career (though Frank has gone on to become even more selfish and concerned with the bottom line than even he was) Cross simply dismisses the episode as the result of high level executive pressure. In particular Frank is stressing out about his network's live Christmas eve broadcast which is surprise, surprise a big budget live version of 'A Christmas Carol'. However he is in turn visited by 3 very different versions of the ghosts of Christmas Past, Present and Future to the one's represented in the Dicken's tale , with the possible exception of the final ghost who is much more traditional in representation than the others. The role of Tiny Tim and Bob Cratchet are represented by Cross's long suffering secretary and her young son who is a mute as a result of the trauma of seeing his father murdered several years before. There is a couple of interesting side stories involving Murray rekindling the only real relationship he has ever had with his first love Clare who he decides to recontact amongst all of the madness as well as a confident young new executive who has been brought on board and tries to act as Frank's friend but is clearly planning to usurp him. This attempt is aided by everyone's perception that Frank appears to be suffering some kind of breakdown as he tries to deal with the bizarre impingement on his life by the aforementioned ghosts. Possibly the most entertaining of the story lines not relating directly to the main one involves a naive young board member played by the usually larger than life, but here toned down, Bobcat Goldthwaite who has been fired as a result of innocently questioning a violent promo for the live show which Cross has commissioned. As Frank is dealing with his ghost's Bobcat's character descends into a rather pathetic depression and desperate alcoholism , in the space of a few days, as he tries to come to terms with his unemployment.I really enjoyed John Glover as the slimy Californian exec who is obviously after Cross's job. It kind of underlines the point that though Cross is nasty at least what you see is what you get. Glover's character is completely 2-faced. The character obviously made an impact on the makers of Gremlins 2 because they cast Glover in an almost identical role in that movie a mere two years later.Karen Allen as Carol is convincingly sweet and warm as possibly the only person who can truly help redeem Frank but both her and Robert Mitchum as Frank's boss are somewhat underused and in the case of a legendary talent like Mitchum's you almost wonder why he is in it.Anyway in summation if you like Murray you'll love this. If you don't your enjoyment may suffer but there are still laughs to be had at the send ups of Christmas Network programming ie-. 'Bob Goulet's Cajun Christmas' , 'The Night the Reindeer Died' with Lee Majors and 'Dad Loves Chasing Beaver.' The soundtrack, special effects and make-up are also first rate. However be warned, it is very dark and at times a little sad, particularly in one scene in which Frank re-encounters one of the homeless people he had met earlier at Claire's shelter in a disused boiler room on a typically freezing New York winters night. So if your looking for an uplifting, fun seasonal movie instead of just a good laugh then avoid this. At least up until the end anyway where they all live happily ever after. I would also not be to keen on showing it to very young kids. Its not exactly a horror film but there are enough moments to scare some children and the humour is for the best part more on the adult side.

However when the second ghost comes in the form of some wacky, sadistic fairy then it started to go downhill. She was not really funny and Frank's going more and more loony was not very funny either. The third ghost was rather meh.Sure there are a few laughs sprinkled around but not enough to elevate the movie to the heights that I was hoping from a movie with Bill Murray and based on Dickens' story. Most importantly, I never really got that nice and cozy Christmas tale feeling when watching the movie. The ending with the lunatic and disjointed speech by Frank was quite a letdown as far as I am concerned.The movie was good enough that the evening did not feel like a real waste but that is about it.

This time around, Ebenezer is one Frank Cross (Murray), programming executive for a major television network with an office in New York.  Above all else, Cross covets the `ratings' he can add to his coffers, and this year he's going all out with a `live' broadcast of `A Christmas Carol' planned for Christmas Eve, starring Buddy Hackett as Scrooge and Mary Lou Retton as Tiny Tim.  And that's just a taste of the kind of humor this film has to offer.  There's more, much more, and it's all handled with aplomb by Donner, Murray and a great supporting cast. 	Whatever genre he's working in, Donner knows his stuff and knows how to deliver the goods.  Here he wisely lets Murray lead the way, but keeps his star on task and the film moving along with a tempered pace and great timing.  The story remains the same, but placing Scrooge-- Cross-- in the entertainment industry was a stroke of genius, and it all works exceedingly well, as it gives the audience a medium with which it can readily identify.  Let's face it, television is a part of our culture, like it or not, and it's here to stay; and in this instance, using it as a setting for this story offers a `tableau vivant' rich with possibilities that are tapped to the fullest.  There's a promo for the upcoming live broadcast like you've never seen before; there's the `inside' industry jokes, like Network executive Preston Rhinelander (Robert Mitchum) urging programming for cats; `Marley's ghost' becomes Lew Hayward (John Forsythe) the exec who sold his soul for ratings; the casting of Hackett and Retton; but most of all, it puts Murray right in his element. 	Murray gets right to the heart of the character, imbuing Cross with a sense of jaded, dubious and sarcastic paranoia that so perfectly fits the psychological make-up of an executive in a business where you're only as good as yesterday's ratings.  And Murray plays him to the hilts; he has the tone and the body language, and nobody can look `askance' like he can, a nuance he makes the most of here.  it's an original take on a familiar character, and in Murray's skin Cross becomes a memorable and entirely believable figure, from his credible ruthlessness (he fires an underling, Eliot Loudermilk--played by Bob Goldthwait-- just before Christmas for disagreeing with his `vision') to his epiphany on Christmas Eve. 	The terrific supporting cast includes Karen Allen as Claire, the girl Frank lets slip away as he follows the siren's song of career; John Glover (Bryce Cummings) as Frank's new `assistant,' plotting his way to the top; Alfre Woodard (Grace) as Frank's secretary, a single mom with a sick child; Michael J. Pollard (Herman); Nicholas Phillips (Calvin); John Murray (James); Brian Doyle-Murray (Earl Cross); David Johansen, as the cab-driving Ghost of Christmas Past; and Carol Kane, who turns in an unforgettable, hilarious, scene-stealing  performance as the Ghost of Christmas Present.  There's plenty of laughs and some touching moments in `Scrooged,' which is a wonderfully entertaining holiday treat, especially if you want your `Christmas Carol' served up just a little bit differently this year.  And the speech Murray gives at the end, once he's had his revelation, is worth the price of admission alone; it's one of those things Murray does best, and he really connects with the audience, especially when he finishes up by leading everyone involved (including the audience) in song.  This is a movie that has become an annual event for many since it's arrival on video;  give yourself a present this year and put this one under your tree.  You'll be glad you did.  Like the song at the end (sung by Annie Lennox and Al Green), it'll `Put A Little Love In Your Heart.'  I rate this one 8/10.

In his office he has a sign which defines Cross. 'Something you nail people to!'For Christmas Murray has devised a multi location live television broadcast which has to be the show to watch with a strong promotional clip to publicise it which makes his fellow executives sick. However he has to contend with a rival, John Glover, there to help out but actually eyeing up his job.One night before Christmas his old television boss (John Forsythe) who has been dead for years visits him and tells him to mend his ways and informs him that he will be visited by three ghosts.They include the Ghost of Christmas past, a cigar smoking cab driver, the Ghost of Christmas Present, an angelic fairy who likes a bit of the rough stuff and certainly dishes it out, finally the Ghost of Christmas Future, a terrifying dark hooded figure who would certainly scare the kids.Each ghostly spectre takes Murray to a time and place. Such as when he was young and dorky working his way up in television and in love with Karen Allen. As time goes by he becomes obsessed with work and frustrated by Allen's do-gooder attitude.Murray actually calls on Allen when he his spooked out and finds out that she is helping out with the homeless but she stirs something in Murray who his still a Grinch.There is no Cratchit in this movie that part in effect goes to Alfre Woodard who plays Murray's secretary and Bobcat Goldthwait plays an executive whose life heads towards a downward spiral when he is dismissed by Murray.I remember the film was largely dismissed by critics when the film was released but it is rather an enjoyable reworking of Dicken;s story. Murray despite not getting on with the director pitches it just right, almost remaining lovable even though he is mean spirited. I rather enjoyed his Richard Burton impression. The film has lots of star cameos from John Houseman, Lee Majors, Jamie Farr, Anne Ramsey and Robert Mitchum as Murray's cat obsessed boss.Director Richard Donner adds plenty of social commentary with references to apartheid South Africa for example.The ending might be regarded as tad sentimental which follows the book, but once they start singing the final song even you would want to 'Put a Little Love in Your Heart.'

He is not really that funny and they just follow the regular Christmas Carol scenes that you would expect in a straight-up adaptation. But Murray temporarily saves the movie and stops it from becoming boring. Temporarily...The movie dies once the second ghost shows up, played by Carol Kane. She is the least funny person I've seen in a comedy in a long time and ruins this entire part. Even worse, the story now continues on very predictably...The ending is incredibly boring. This is where the movie stops to be a parody and just follows the regular story of Christmas Carol, a pretty mediocre one at that. The ending would have worked far better if they had chosen to give it a twist (Blackadder style) and given Murray a better script to work with. At the end, he breaks the fourth wall and starts to ramble at the audience, which I'm assuming was done for comedic purposes but falls flat.I don't recommend Scrooged, unless you want something for your kids at Christmas.

A ridiculous sub-plot of the most garish, oddball, TV version of Scrooge live with Mary Lou Retton as an acrobatic Tiny Tim and a surprisingly good (yet funny) Buddy Hackett as Bob Cratchit. The solid Gold Dancers as The Scroogettes. So much going on. Murray is pursued by Bobcat Goldwaithe as an armed disgruntled ex-employee. Does it all work? Partially. So many good and bad cameos, including Michael J. Pollard. Younger viewers might not recognize them all. An over-the-top ending that you will either love or hate, as Frank Cross (Bill Murray) give the most sincere or insincere performance of his life as he stops the live show in it's tracks with his apology to all. You will enjoy it more if you are a Bill Murray fan. It holds up quite well, being almost 30-years- old! Fun for all but a very strange version of Scrooge! It might require a 2nd viewing, as the modern-day parallels to The Dickens' characters are a bit vague, at best.

He had a distinct comedic style and he delivered almost every time. Scrooged was primed and ready for a Bill Murray performance and he is terrific in it. He can play a role completely sarcastically and yet you suddenly find yourself invested in the character and actually caring about him. Its what made him indelible in his SNL skit days. I am always amazed that Hollywood actually manages to take a concept that they have milked to death (in this case Charles Dickens' immortal classic A Christmas Carol) and actually find one more slightly unique way to do it. Scrooged puts the timeless tale inside of itself, puts an absolutely adult spin on it and turns sarcasm and brutal pessimism into a heartfelt story. I was even surprised by how touched I was by the final scenes. I was convinced they couldn't turn it into something tangible by the end and they do which really captures the Dickens spirit I think. Best of all, the film is very funny, laugh out loud funny with physical comedy, outrageous stunts and Murray's fast talking, witty one liners that really work especially if you're a fan of his.I seem to have already talked a lot about Bill Murray headlining the film. He is terrific in the Scrooge type role and you know what you're in for if you know his work in that period. Karen Allen is an unusual choice for Murray's romantic interest. I don't think I've seen Allen in much and being a huge Indiana Jones fan, I always recognize her as Indy's first love Marion. She's very plain but I don't mean that to be insulting. She's just very girl next door, down to earth and looks very sweet in this film and it works very well. You actually really root for their romance because it feels so genuine. Its not that they have amazing chemistry but there is something the works. David Johansen and Carol Kane are two of our Christmas spirits. Kane is hilariously over the top and Johansen is pretty terrific too. Bobcat Goldthwait is fantastic in a small but significant supporting role, John Glover, Robert Mitchum and John Forsyth are all very good in small supporting roles. Alfre Woodard is good but a little underdeveloped as the Bob Cratchit type character, a nice little twist on the story and Nicholas Phillips is very good but completely underdeveloped as her son. The cast work very well together and fit their respective roles.Richard Donner is one of my favourite mainstream directors. He has directed some truly outstanding films and had an incredible start in Television too. He knows how to tell a terrific story and get the most out of characters. This is a little bit of a different type of movie for him but it definitely has a style unique to him as well. Even if someone absolutely hated or was sick of seeing A Christmas Carol, Scrooged is told in such a way that you won't even realize what you're watching. Its different and fun and dark and twisted and almost satirical in many ways. Satire is a genre of comedy rarely done well anymore and this is an example of what it used to be like. Scrooged is also classically 80's in the way that it unabashedly uses sexual innuendos, gratuitous bad language and doesn't apologize for it regardless of the fact that its a Christmas film. So adults if you're looking for something with a little bite and something outside the box for a Christmas film and have never watched this I definitely recommend it. Its entirely entertaining. 8/10 "},{"Title":"There were Rudolph, Charlie Brown, and the Griswold family, but few might have heard the best of them all BILL MURRAY! Wait what?","Date":"7 April 2014","Score":"","Genre":"Comedy, Drama, Fantasy","Review":" ScroogedScrooged is like a wild animal, going all over the place acting all crazy. Throwing everything they can think of in your face. Adult humor, goofy humor, really dark moments, all kinds of weird stuff. Then an animal tamer (director Richard Donner) comes in to put the animal back in focus. Showing him that he is still a A Christmas Carol modern day retelling that is suppose to be heartwarming. Still make it funny and goofy, but not go to far. Finally just to be an entertaining time for tourists. Which made me give this attraction a thumbs up.The story is about a man named Francis Xavier Cross (Bill Murray) a TV executive who is a cruel harsh jerk that loves to humiliate and torment his co-workers. In order to boost his career and keep it alive, also he loves the holiday season. For the reason of all the commercial during the time. Making a giant live TV special of A Christmas Carol due to as he puts it All these little idiots are going to be watching the boob tube. He gets visited the night before Christmas Eve by the ghost of his old business partner Lew (John Forsythe) telling him he's going to be visited by the three ghosts of Christmas. The Past, Present, and Future to show him at he error of his ways. So things do get a little chaotic. Now he must either learn the way to live, or spent the rest of his life ruining other people lives.Half of the charm of the movie comes from how inventive the story is when it comes to A Christmas Carol. It finds ways to still keep you engaged with the plot even though you know what's going to happen. For example Bob Cratchit from the original has been split up into two characters. Bobcat Goldthwait's character who is really funny, and Alfre Woodard's character who is likable and the mother of the Timmy Tim of the movie. (Which is not sick in the movie if you read the Charles Dickens book). The other charm of the movie is the humor, mostly due to Bill Murray. He is one of those actors who can play those jerk protagonist, and the writers took that to a full extent. His character is a harsh, cruel, mean dirt-bag, doing some very nasty stuff. Like reacting really gladly to the fact that the crazy commercial he made for A Christmas Carol was an old lady having a heart attack once she saw it. But he is so fun to watch as he does this harsh because he knows how to make at least funny. He has done this kind of role before, so he has some experience. Saying he is just funny is more of an understatement. He is also really emotionally dramatic at times, giving off some very believable emotional performances. Due to that we actually learn a lot about this guy threw the movie, and his setup was also really good too. He is definitely the best character in the movie. The more I think about it I think the only reason people went to work on this movie is because Bill Murray was in it and he was big back in the 80s. Doing popular movies like Caddyshack, Stripes, and probably his most famous Ghostbusters. Speaking of the characters all the other people in the movie are really enjoyable too. Karen Allen as Frank's girlfriend brings a likable charm to the character that would put a smile on your face. John Fortsythe as Frank's old business partner was nice to see for his little scene. David Johansen was fun to watch as the Ghost of Christmas Past. Carol Kane as the Ghost of Christmas Present gets kind of annoying at times but I still enjoyed seeing her on screen. It's just a fun batch of characters that were all likable and entertaining in their own way.Although the movie is not for everyone (due to it getting a mixed reaction). There will be some things in the movie that might annoy people, or just make them go Whaaaat? Like the fact that the opening of the movie is (I kid you not) a terrorist attack at Santa's Workshop. Then again I never thought it was too annoying, since the movie also is a satire of pop culture, and that part was making fun of the weird Santa Claus movies in the 30s - 50s. Ones like Santa Claus Conquers the Martians. Also I don't feel this is the first movie you should watch when you want to get the Christmas feeling. But at the same time I'm not sure about that, because the director keeps everything in focus. Still trying to get the magic Christmas spark, and Bill Murray does get the emotional parts right. Even though some might kinda fall flat to people.In the end Scrooged is a movie that depends on how you look at it. If you're one of those people who loves the heartwarming Christmas classics like Miracle on 34th Street or A Charlie Brown Christmas this most likely won't please you. But if you're one of those people who is a fan of Bill Murray and likes a good Christmas comedy like National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation there is a good chance you'll like this movie. I still recommend it to at least try the movie, because the negative people might find something enjoyable in the movie. Me I really enjoyed the movie. I don't think it will be fondly remembered in the future, but I'll still remember it years later in the Christmas Future.

There have been a lot of Christmas movies over the years and they all have something to say about the holiday season. But when you look at the movies that I watch, you notice a very obvious trend. I tend to gravitate towards those that follow in the footsteps of the classic Dickens tale. I'm sure you know the one I am talking about, and if you don't then reading my blog will most definitely give you the inside track. And so we come to the great film Scrooged. A classic in its own right, part of a great trend of films that came from the era of the 1980s, starring the illustrious Bill Murray.Now Bill Murray is something of a gem when it comes to the films that he is in. I don't think anyone would argue with me if I said that in the era of mid-late 80s and early 90s Bill Murray could do no wrong. From Ghostbusters to What About Bob to Groundhog Day these films are hugely popular, thanks in no small part to the performance of Mr. Murray. Whether these films stand the test of time is another question entirely, but for anyone who wants to take a look back at the world they used to live in this is a great film. Scrooged on the other hand has something that his other films don't, it adapts a story which has stood the test of time already and gives it a modern twist, or at least what was modern for the day.Not since West Side Story's adaptation of Romeo and Juliet have people so embraced a modern version of a story that's been repeated by so many before it and many more afterwards. In part because it's very clear in watching it that the people involved understood the adaptation they were making and the times they were living in. They were smart enough to change key elements, like the names of the characters involved but never lost sight of the idea that the original characters they represented were key to making the story work. And the one major change they did make was played to perfection for the modern telling by the great Bobcat Goldthwait.Would you like to get Scrooged? I do, and so should you.

Woodward (Crooklyn) plays Frank's secretary, Grace Cooley who tries to spend time with her family, but works constantly, Allen (Starman) plays Frank's ex-girlfriend, Claire who helps the needy, Goldthwait (One Crazy Summer) plays exec, Elliot who gets fired by Frank, but tries to get even, the late, Mitchum (Cape Fear) plays Frank's head boss, Preston Rhinelander and Glover (Gremlins 2) plays Brice Cummings, Frank's new exec hired by Preston to direct their live TV special, Scrooge. Soon, Frank gets a visit from his old boss & friend, Lew Hayward (Forsythe) telling him he's going to be visited by 3 spirits. When Frank meets ghosts of past (Johansen), present (Kane) & future, he begins to understand the true meaning of Christmas. Murray's brothers, Brian, Joel and John also appear. This is a good comedy take of the Dickens classic I've always enjoyed. It features a good cast, great score by Danny Elfman and neat effects.

Bill Murray never, to me anyway, looked comfortable in the role of Frank Cross, someone who polarizes everyone he comes in contact with, completely concerned with only his own needs and wants. John Glover is Brice, hired by the the leader of the studio, Preston(Robert Mitchum, who presents his character as if he's approaching senility), a potential problem for Frank's future as the man calling(most)of the shots. Glover is full of energy and enthusiasm, a people's guy who talks a mile a minute and seems very persuasive in gaining the favor of those around him.The first ghost(I'll get to Forsythe in a minute)is David Johansen(from the New York Dolls), Christmas Past, who drives a taxi cab full of smoke from his cigars, kind of resembling a chain-smoking, yellow-teethed elf(his has Vulcan ears)you might dig up in an alley somewhere catching zzz's in a cardboard box. Ghost Past carries him to his home as a child(whose meat market father is portrayed by Bryan Doyle Murray), not to mention, we see the love passed up for a career in radiant Karen Allen's Claire Phillips. The second is fairy Carol Kane, Christmas Present, with wings and a tutu, all sparkly, who enjoys smacking around Frank, punching him in the face repeatedly, as they visit his underpaid secretary's happy(if fatherless due to his murder)home and brother's party with friends. It's here Frank begins to see how empty his life is. The third is a ridiculously large, hulking Reaper as The Ghost of Christmas Yet to Come and Frank's visits (with the visual stylings of surrealistic art deco) involving his secretary Grace's visit to her mute son in a padded cell and Claire, now a cold hearted bitch who yells for pauper kids to leave her midst, are simply bizarre(and lack any form of emotional depth). The problem is when Frank finds the errors of his ways in regards to walking over innocent people to get to the top, it doesn't ring true or have any form of sincerity. Murray constantly barks loudly throughout the movie and never really captures your heart. This whole movie reeks of cynicism, and sadly lacks the Murray charm. I dunno, in the past I've enjoyed this movie, but this year it's so hollow and so many of the characters come off annoying and/or aggravating, especially Carol Kane who I wanted to see in a choke hold until her eyes popped out. Steller make-up work on Forsythe who informs Frank of the three ghosts' visits, a rotted corpse, with little flesh, mainly bones and dust. John Murray(Bill's actual brother)portrays Frank's brother, James. Alfre Woodard is Grace, Frank's beleaguered secretary. Bobcat Goldthwait is the poor employee who tells(correctly)Frank that his commercials for a bloody horror movie, SCROOGE(in name only), are ill advised, getting sacked in the process. Bobcat, drunk, unemployed, his wife having left him, goes berserk attempting to kill Frank with a shotgun at the end. A supporting cast, which includes Buddy Hacket and John Houseman as participants in the big-budgeted IBC(the name of the network company for which Frank is in charge)live telling of Scrooge, yielding a collection of familiar faces.

"},{"Title":"In defense of Scrooged","Date":"14 January 2010","Score":"","Genre":"Comedy, Drama, Fantasy","Review":" Scrooged is a little comedic gem that I rank somewhere between A Christmas Story and Elf among yuletide movies, and between Stripes and What About Bob? in the Bill Murray oeuvre. It has suffered commercially because the dark palettes and tones used by the director have precluded people from adding it to their holiday traditions (who sits around a tree and says let's watch 'Scrooged'!?), and also because this role was a departure of sorts for Murray. It was his Cable Guy. The reaction was summed up by Roger Ebert's one-star review where the main problem seemed to be the disquieting, unsettling tone and Murray's character, Cross, being a thoroughly miserable wretch. It's an understandable take and one that was probably widely shared, mostly because by now we all carry an impression of Ebenezer Scrooge as a crusty old miser with a heart of gold just waiting to burst through. The term scrooge itself has entered the lexicon as a mild reprimand, a synonym for party-pooper. Heck, it's almost lovable! What I think we all overlook, however, is how dark, unsettling, and miserable the source material from Dickens actually was. The Scrooge from A Christmas Carol was a man who fed himself gruel and wouldn't heat his own home, all just to save money. According to Dickens, External heat and cold had little influence on Scrooge. No warmth could warm, no wintry weather chill him. No wind that blew was bitterer than he, no falling snow was more intent upon its purpose, no pelting rain less open to entreaty. Ebenezer had long since given up on love, family, or simple pleasures, and further was a squeezing, wrenching, grasping, scarping, clutching, covetous old sinner who carried his own low temperature always about with him. To him, brotherhood of man was an alien concept, and other people were (at best) commodities or (at worst) things to be loathed. To quote Scrooge, Every idiot who goes about with Merry Christmas on his lips should be boiled with his own pudding and buried with a stake of holly through his heart, and he didn't say it to get a laugh. Ignoring the darkest aspects of Scrooge's character is a disservice to the story.So not only was it fair, it was necessary to make the Cross character the wretch he was. And for my money, Murray did a great job of giving us glimpses of Cross's humanity at even his darkest moments. And how dark was he really? Show me a corporate executive who hasn't fired someone near the holidays to save payroll. Show me a media mogul who hasn't attempted to profit off of people's fears and insecurities. And show me a TV producer who hasn't stapled toy antlers to a mouse.Okay, so that last one doesn't stick, but that moment in the movie still proves my point. However serious Cross may be about being an ass, Murray delivers it in such a way that allows us to laugh.Probably what I appreciate most about the film is the adaptation. Say what you will about the folly of modernizing and American-izing classic tales &#x96; if 'A Christmas Carol' had to be set in 1980s America, this was the way to do it. There are several moments in the film that are RIGHT, like when the first ghost (Forsythe) appears. Like any scared, ruthless, modern executive, Cross reacts by emptying his revolver at the intruder. The film then shows Cross wise-cracking his way through the visitations mainly because it's entertaining, but also because that would be the defense mechanism of a cynical, world-weary man. These moments fit. Nowadays, studios call it a remake if they take a 20-year-old screenplay and cast different actors. Scrooged at least gets credit for being a true reinvention.Sure, there are flaws. Karen Allen's character is weak and Cross's speech at the end is cloying and drawn out. And maybe too much slapstick with the ghosts. But I still consider this an underrated gem.

I couldn't help but think that he may have made a better American Psycho than Christian Bale, and I'm a huge Bale/Bateman fan.

Modern retellings can be tricky to pull off as they can often be unnecessary and uninspired but this is neither. The setting and characters all work to create a dark comedy treat that's fun to watch at the holliday season. That being said, I have to say that I would give the movie 3 stars and not 4. Although it's a comedy, you wont be belly laughing every minute. There are some really funny parts, but other parts are more amusing than funny; thankfully, the jokes never fall flat. As far as drama goes, it probably won't have you choked up the way other versions of the Dickens classic would. So, you're reading this saying It's a comedy that could be funnier and a drama that could be more emotional. Doesn't sound all that great. What makes the movie worthwhile though is the combination of drama and comedy. It's a clever idea pulled off by great acting, that's the other thing that needs mention. Bill Muray is not only funny, but he can really act and he pulls the movie off, along with great supporting work from the rest of the cast. All in all, definitely worth a viewing during the X-Mas season. "},{"Title":"Give'em a towel  Not!

And the part that just seems mean. The only thing is they aren't separated. It changes from scene to scene and sometimes in the middle of a scene. Sometimes Murray makes me laugh, and want to see his character find love & joy. Sometimes I want him to fall down an elevator shaft from the 15th floor. The ending is fun yet a little sappy. Yet I like the pace that the director has set for the movie. And most of the time I like Murray. When he screams at the kid, I think he seemed to mean, to evil. It wasn't an I'm annoyed scream. It seemed more like an I hate your freaking guts scream. But the ghosts are 100% perfect. Even though the ghost of Christmas future isn't really in the movie to much. And I love the disgruntled worker. Bobcat whatever his last name is, does a great job. So overall it's a good comedy and has enough weirdness to keep it fun. But not suggested as a family Christmas movie. 7 out of 10.

Considering he's only directed a handful of films of which many of them gained lots of praise or went on to be cult films, it's surprising when moments like these happen. Richard Donner headed Superman (1978), The Goonies (1985) and Lethal Weapon (1987). So for this, it's even more confusing when a well- respected director is paired up with decent writers and a cast of good actors. For comedy legend like Bill Murray, being in popular movies like Caddyshack (1980), Stripes (1981) and of course Ghost Busters (1984), how can a pairing create an output so okay-ish feeling? It may be hard to believe but it is in fact a film that's better than average but only marginally. Apparently it was reported that Bill Murray and Richard Donner did not get along during production either so this could be why. Things could have always been worse though I guess.The film screenplay is another alteration of the classic Charles Dickens story of the Christmas Carol. Here Murray plays Frank Cross, the head chair of a major TV studio that loves finding and attracting any viewer they can find. Until on the night of Christmas Eve, Cross will be given a chance to redeem himself as a better person. Written by Michael O'Donoghue (an SNL writer) and Mitch Glazer (probably his best known writing credit), the script to this holiday comedy can be hit and miss. For example, the studio will do anything it can to make sure its the hottest thing being watched, whether its making parody films of classic Christmas tales, straight out desecrating them or even making channel programs that appeal to cat and dog viewers. It's a bit of stretch there, especially the last one. A lot of these incidents feel over exaggerated and feels forced on the audience like they're supposed to believe that people would accept such things and find it believable.What is a nice change of pace is Richard Donner's directing skills. The story execution is fairly predictable but there are some various changes to the script that make it feel like effort was put in to make sure it doesn't feel like an exact copy. Much of this is due to the supporting cast being so helpful in their comedic timing and how they knock up Murray's character. John Forsythe as Cross' dead business partner has possibly the best introduction than any other ghost who visits him. David Johansen as the taxi driving ghost of Christmas past is the second best character with his no-cares given attitude. Perhaps the ghost who gets the cutest and most violent personality is Carol Kane as the ghost of Christmas present. There's also characters played by Karen Allen (Cross' ex), Bobcat Goldthwait (the voice of XL from Buzz Lightyear of Star Command (2000)), Robert Mitchum, Michael J. Pollard and Alfre Woodard playing a Bob Cratchet-like role. Then there's Bill Murray who is surprisingly the exact opposite.It's not that he is unfunny because there are occasional scenes that do produce a laugh, but the problem is he produces the least amount. Yes, Cross is supposed to be unfeeling but even unfeeling characters can have some kind of charm; but Murray doesn't pull it off. It's more obnoxious than charming. Another problem in the script is sometimes the story will spin off the main focus from Cross' development as a character and just wonder back into his reality to do whatever. It's distracting. Back to positives though, a visual element that works in this films favor are the special / practical effects. The special makeup effects creator / designers behind those scenes were Thomas R. Burman and Bari Dreiband- Burman (The Goonies (1985)& Die Hard 2 (1990)). There's also special effects supervisor Eric Brevig (Total Recall (1990), Hook (1991) and Men in Black (1997)) who shows that even before big Hollywood blockbusters he still had the talent needed to make things look good.Thankfully another visual treat is Michael Chapman's cinematography. Chapman is also the cameraman for Taxi Driver (1976), Ghost Busters II (1989), Space Jam (1996) and Six Days, Seven Nights (1998) all of which had decent lighting and steady movement. Also Chapman's work mixes evenly with whatever special or practical effects were put to screen. Lastly is Danny Elfman's score to the film that oddly enough sounds like a precursor to his future score for The Nightmare Before Christmas (1993). Sadly though, his score here feels underdeveloped. It is clear that its Elfman's signature theme with chanting choirs in a minor key, but after the title card appears it disappears for quite a long time. Then out of nowhere it rears its head and then abruptly vanishes again. Viewing Lala Land records website, it seems like there was a lot of material that wasn't used. It's also a shame when not even the original composition is that prevalent in the final product. What gives post production? Either way, when heard it is enjoyable.This holiday comedy does have some unique mutations with its direction in the script, but it also suffers from its main lead (Bill Murray) not being that funny and the main story sometimes jumping around. Thankfully the camera-work is able, the creature effects are well crafted, the music (although not abundant) is appropriate and the supporting cast adding to the laughs.

It's a dark, biting and sarcastic take on the tale that's set firmly in the murk of the corporation-friendly '80s, but it completely falls apart on the back nine. The first act is an inspired lampoon of bad network television (and the bad network executives behind it) with Murray, deliciously sinister as the worst boss in America, at the height of his powers. It's when the narrative tries to cram in a tepid love story and a sudden, jolting redemption that the cornerstones begin to crumble. This really could've worked if it didn't wear its intentions and inspirations so garishly on its chest, but subtlety is, sadly, not among the picture's attributes.

It's a children's movie from the '80's, so they pace is a bit slow. (There is some mild language in it though, so I wouldn't let the VERY young kids see it.) The plot is sort of Network meets A Christmas Carol. Bill Murry, TV producer is a selfish workaholic who will do anything to up the ratings for his station, including incorporating sexy dance numbers and violent explosions in their production of A Christmas Carol. He makes everyone work producing a live Christmas Carol on Christmas Eve, so no one gets to spend Christmas Eve with their families.Bill Murry must be a really nice guy, because I did not think he was a convincing meany at all. But it's a kids movie, so that's okay. Bill's character's name is Frank Xavior Cross. At one time, there is a definition of Cross posted in the background as Something you nail people to. Xavior is Latin for Savior, and Frank means honest, so I liked this subtle reference to Christ in the movie.There are references to things in the '80's. Bill Murry has a mullet haircut at one point. He drinks Bacardi with Tab. He has a vision of a man on fire and he mentions Richard Pryor. They show a film clip that has a drive-by shooting. The thrill of Ginsu knives. Reference to Chernobyl. Mary Lou Rhetton is also in the movie.One of the best parts is the Ghost of Christmas Present. Carol Kane is dressed like a frothy pink fairy princess, and she imitates the sweet, trilling voice of Glenda the Good Witch of the North, but she constantly bops, pokes and tweaks Bill Murry every chance she gets, like Moe of the Three Stooges.The ending was my favorite part super feel-good ending. Bill talks to everyone, including the viewing audience about being nice, kind and wonderful; about being the kind of person that you know you should be. Everyone bursts into song and Bill looks right at the camera and encourages us to sing along! Wonderful!

Since I am now finding myself catching up with several films from the 1980s that I missed out on when they originally came out, and given that we are in full Christmas swing, it was perhaps a given that I was going to give this one a look at this point in time. First of all, I was surprised to see that such a star-studded cast was roped in for what was, essentially, a largely unsympathetic re-reading of a beloved literary classic Bill Murray (obviously essaying an Ebenezer Scrooge for the TV-fed generation), Karen Allen (as his neglected school sweetheart), John Glover, Bobcat Goldwaithe (as a sacked underling who takes matters into his own hands) and Alfre Woodard comprise the 'newer' talents; Jamie Farr (unrecognizable as Jacob Marley!), John Forsythe, John Houseman (introducing the current TV adaptation of the Dickens story currently being produced by Murray), Buddy Hackett (as TV's Scrooge), Robert Mitchum (as Murray's boss) and Michael J.

Although the overlong coda tries very hard to infuse some good cheer into the dismal world-view that we have inhabited until then, I still cut this film some slack for going all the way on the fantasy stuff (the make-up artists received an Oscar nod for their troubles) and holding out somewhat on the soppy material (nevertheless, we do get a mute colored boy in place of the lame Tiny Tim!).

Certainly in Scrooged the first incarnation of Cross has all the best lines .Top TV executives are supposed to be like that,devoid of conscience and acid of tongue.If one was ever portrayed in any other way the box office would be besieged by people demanding their money back. It's a dog eat dog world and no doubt Cross's route to the top is strewn with the bloody carcasses of his rivals.The night the reindeer died is the child of his genius,his legacy to future generations of TV execs to come. Mr Murray forces us to admire him for his chutzpah,laugh at him for his mordant wit but dislike him for his overwhelming selfishness and pity him for his lack of empathy of almost sociopathic proportions.Cross is one of the great monster creations in the movies. After his Damascene conversion he becomes just another nice guy, sensitive, generous,compassionate .Nice .........but dull. No more Mr Nasty Guy.Well,I know which Cross I preferred,and so,I suspect,would many of the audience.

Since I do like Murray and his style, I loved Scrooged. It's full of slapstick, sight gags, and Murray's caustic one-liners, and delightful performances by familiar character actors. All of that helps Scrooged avoid the Victorian heaviness of most orthodox productions of A Christmas Carol. And Scrooged delivers the same promise of redemption for the jaded and cynical Frank Cross (Bill Murray)'s transformation moves me more than do most straight versions of A Christmas Carol, and I watch Scrooged year-round, not just at Christmas.Some of the reviews here unjustly say that Scrooged departs from the Dickens story. It's adapted to the modern day and to Murray's biting comic style, but otherwise Scrooged is true to the heart of A Christmas Carol. A man who was kind and loving in his youth turns cynical, greedy, and mean, and is redeemed through the intervention of the four ghosts (three of whom are played, in Scrooged, by the talented John Forsythe, David Johansen, and Carol Kane). Bob Cratchit, Tiny Tim, and the woman Scrooge loved in his youth have their counterparts too.Scrooged isn't exactly a family movie. It has a fair bit of profanity, and several scenes that are gruesome even though the effects are obviously and intentionally fake. And its Ghost of Christmas Future is more grisly than most. If you're planning to show Scrooged to kids under about age 10, or especially sensitive kids, preview it yourself first.A good guide to whether you'll like Scrooged is Groundhog Day. Scrooged has the main character's same egotism and cynicism (times two!), and the transformation of the character into a human being you'd actually like to know. Groundhog Day was a gentler movie. But if you liked it, and you're OK with some profanity, dead-people special effects, and the Tim-Burtonesque tone, you'll probably like Scrooged.

In both films Murray plays a television personality who is selfish and mean-spirited. Then, throughout the course of both films, he goes through a supernatural experience that changes his ways.In Scrooged, Murray plays Frank Cross, the head of a television station in New York. The station is going to be airing a live telecast of Charles Dickens' A Christmas Carol on Christmas Eve. Since Cross is selfish and mean-spirited, he doesn't care that the cast and crew have to work on Christmas Eve. He also doesn't have much of a Christmas spirit. He orders his secretary to give towels to his brother and other loved ones. Then, through the irony of life, he begins to experience the same fate as Ebenezer Scrooge.Directed by Richard Donner (Superman, The Goonies), Scrooged is a different type of Christmas film, which is why I like it. The film isn't your traditional warm-hearted or nostalgic holiday film. Scrooged is basically a twisted take on a classic Christmas story. I would recommend this film for audiences with a quirky sense of humor. Others may not enjoy it.

It is unlike any other Christmas movie you'll ever see. This is warped, surreal, and insane. Richard Donner surpasses Tim Burton in terms of darkness, and the only problem is that the producers rewrote the script to make it LESS dark. A shame, because they were really onto something. The ghosts are grotesque, the sets are distorted and weird, and even the ending is dark. At first it seems out of synch with the rest of the movie with over the top sentimentality, until you realize it is disturbingly over the top, and Murray is playing the character as if he's been driven insane. The movie as a whole is a lot more chilling if you look at that way.Bill Murray's dry style of humor doesn't work for everyone, but it works for me. He can deliver lines like no one else, and even his facial expressions are genius. When a nerdy, stuttering employee (Bobcat Goldthwaith) tells him, Gee, Mr. Cross, I think you and I are alike in a lot of ways, Murray reacts with the funniest expression in the history of the universe. (It's even funnier than the face he makes at the old lady in the cab in Stripes, and THAT was funny). Frank Cross, like most of Murray's characters, is sarcastic and mean, but with a sense of humor that lets you know there's a good person in there trying to get out. It's the same with the movie there is a heart underneath the morbid tone, and it occasionally surfaces with really touching scenes.I'm not saying it's a perfect movie. The script has weak spots, but the look and style make up for it. It's certainly not for everyone. I can see how some people would find this abrasive.

I like Christmas movies because they're generally nice, lightweight, enjoyable pieces of fluff with important moralistic messages (It's a Wonderful Life, Scrooge) or sometimes they're just fun to watch (Gremlins, Home Alone). Scrooged isn't lightweight, cheery, or happy. It's dark, brooding, sort of evil, and it's the only Christmas movie I can think of that seems as if Tim Burton directed it.Am I insulting the film? Heavens, no. I love it. In fact, I'm complimenting it. Instead of repeating old traditions, it's trying something new, and the secret to the film is the way it actually pulls it all off.The plot Frank Cross is the youngest television station president in recorded history because he knows the people. At least he thinks he does. In reality, he's just a greedy tycoon who gives people bath towels for Christmas -- including his own brother. Cross is a modern day Scrooge, and the movie Scrooged is a modern reworking of the classic Charles Dickens story. Frank Cross is played by Bill Murray absolutely perfectly. He's cynical, dry, and sarcastic, and doesn't give a darn about anyone else other than himself.So the night before Christmas Eve, Frank is visited by an old business partner -- who has been dead for seven years. (I wouldn't have guessed more than three, tops, says Frank in his usual sarcastic tone.) His old associate warns Frank to change his ways or he'll end up like himself -- angry, bitter...and dead.Frank doesn't pay any attention to his hallucination, and continues being his usual self during the festive Christmas holiday -- by ripping off old ladies' cabs and firing Elliot (Bobcat Goldthwait) on Christmas Eve. (Elliot is sort of today's version of Bob Cratchitt.)Frank is putting on a Christmas Eve production of Charles Dickens' immortal classic Scrooge (what happened to A Christmas Carol, I wonder?), and in the film's funniest scene, introduces his ad for the program. (It later scares an old woman to death and Frank takes it as a wonderful sign -- controversy is as good as advertising!)The three ghosts do indeed come and haunt Frank. Except Frank is more cynical than Ebenezer Scrooge ever was, and convincing him that Christmas is a season of giving will be hard. (Frank I get it, you're here to show me my past and I'm supposed to get all dully eyed and mushy. Well forget it pal, you got the wrong guy.)Frank is revisited by an old flame (Karen Allen) and his heart starts to beat once again after years of silence. Frank slowly but surely starts to learn to appreciate Christmas once again, following all of Scrooge's examples. His intern's son, who witnessed his father's murder and hasn't spoken since, is a sort of Tiny Tim, and Scrooged does indeed follow all of the elements of Charles Dickens' classic. Only it updates the tale, throws in a bunch of cameos, and great acting on Murray's behalf.Frank revisits scenes from his childhood and adulthood first hand with the wacky ghosts as companions. They can't see or hear Frank -- his cab driver ghost tells him that he's in the middle of a rerun.Frank remembers how his father brought him meat for Christmas, how he broke up with his girlfriend over a matter of greed vs. happiness, and how his life was a complete waste. (Ghost Let's face it, Frank, garden slugs got more out of life than you. Frank Yeah? Name one!)It was a matter of time before A Christmas Carol, or Scrooge, got a modernized treatment. And it comes out fresh and ingenious, dark and hilarious. The movie owes its entire success to the casting of Bill Murray, whose cynical ways shone through in such early films as Stripes and Ghostbusters, and here compliment the film the way no other actor's talent could.Take, for example, the way he can remain unmoved but, at the same time, flippant and sarcastic, towards his boss when he tells Frank that cats and dogs are starting to watch television, and that he thinks Frank should target some advertising at the canine and feline demographic. Frank just stares at his boss as if he's crazy and whispers, Call the cops.The movie was directed by Richard Donner (Lethal Weapon), and is one of the films I watch as an annual tradition around Christmas. It's dark and often quite disturbing, and its eerie music adds to the mix. But it helps the film because it makes us see through Frank's eyes. And the outcome is, quite frankly, an instant Christmas classic. This is a film I'll be watching for years, and so far, it's only been getting better every time.

Any film version of this perpetually popular Christmas tale is always welcome, and this bizarre update is as entertaining an entry as ever.Frank Cross (Murray) is a greedy, spiteful TV exec always looking for maximum ratings and profit - by any means possible.  His latest seasonal bid to transmit a live TV version of A Christmas Carol is set to air on Christmas Eve (regardless of the fact his scary trailers for it have been frightening people to death).  He cares for no-one, ignores his younger brother James (John Murray), repeatedly slaps down his secretary Grace (Alfre Woodard) and repels the advances of his old girlfriend Claire (Karen Allen), who still holds a candle for him.  Soon enough three spirits arrive to teach him the error of his ways...The update works well in many respects.  It is very Eighties concept to have Scrooge become a greedy Wall Street yuppie, and the story-within-a-story concept is nicely done, rehearsals for the TV show paralleling Frank's transformation.  The script has it's faults.  It is not consistently funny enough and adds a couple of unnecessary characters (Robert Mitchum as Frank's boss and Julian Glover as his intended successor) that only clog up the narrative.  However, the film does capture the tragic aspects of the original tale, the scenes from Christmas future being especially eerie and atmospheric.The film is not perfect technically.  Quite a few of the special effects are cheap-looking by today's standards and the set for the TV studio is a little over-complicated.  But the film makes a good running use of the colour white, and Danny Elfman's wonderful music score, to denote fear or tragedy.  Two simple elements, but they give the film a lift.A different actor should perhaps have been chosen to play Cross.  On the surface, Bill Murray seems like a good choice.  His laid-back, sarcastically cruel comic style makes him seem ideal for the part and it is in those moments that he works very well.  When he tries to convey the more emotional aspects of the character, his lack of acting range is sorely exposed and he seems rather strained.  Because of this, his transformation and eventual redemption never rings quite true.But Murray is helped by a gallery of supporting actors, either playing it straight or for laughs, who help balance the film's mix of comedy and pathos.  David Johansen is a brilliantly manic, cigar-chomping Ghost of Christmas Past.  Carol Kane is a comic delight as the playfully sadistic Ghost of Christmas Present, a fairy who can punch like Mike Tyson.  Bobcat Goldthwaite, of the Police Academy movies, is a treat as a demented former employee of Cross.The radiant Karen Allen is a joy as the too-good-to-be-true Claire, and Alfre Woodard is a picture of patience and dignity as Frank's world-weary secretary.  It is the presence of these performers who save the film, adding oomph to the enjoyable end-of-movie singalong.A little more revision at the planning stage could have helped iron out the flaws in this movie, but it remains an enjoyable seasonal treat regardless.

Scrooged isn't one of the best Christmas movies ever made, but that doesn't mean it's a bad movie. This is in fact a pretty funny picture, a screwball comic fantasy somewhat based on Charles Dickens' classic tale Scrooge. This version is updated to modern times and is played mostly for laughs. Bill Murray gets a chance to go way over-the-top in his portrayl of Frank Cross, the IBC-TV executive who doesn't care about anyone. This guy literally is Scrooge. He makes the lives of everyone around him miserable. Then one night close to Christmas he gets a visit from his late former boss Lew Hayward (John Forsythe) who warns him that he'll be visited by three ghosts. The three ghosts will try to get Frank to change his personality by showing him the past, present, and future. Scrooged features an all-star cast of terrific actors. Besides Murray and Forsythe, there's Karen Allen as Claire Phillips, Frank's girlfriend from the past who pays him a visit; Bobcat Goldthwait as Eliot Loudermilk, an IBC employee Frank fires right before Christmas after making a criticism about a Scrooge ad Frank plans to air on the network that has absolutely nothing to do with Scrooge and is guaranteed to scare the heck out of anyone who sees it; Alfre Woodard as Grace Cooley, Frank's secretary who has a son that's mute; Robert Michum as Preston Rhinelander, the chief executive officer of IBC; David Johansen as the Ghost of Christmas Past disguised as a smelly cab driver; and (in the film's best performance) Carol Kane as the Ghost of Christmas Present passing herself off as a sugar plum fairy. There are also many cameo appearences, which include John Houseman, Jamie Farr, Lee Majors, Robert Goulet, and Olympic Gold Medal winning gymnast Mary Lou Retton (as Tiny Tim). Scrooged isn't quite the classic Christmas movie like A Christmas Story. It isn't as funny as Story or National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation.

It has now been quite a number of years since I last saw it and it seems I've changed my view somewhat. I'm not sure if it's because I've got older (& wiser), or it's because it has become dated, but I certainly didn't enjoy it as much as I used to. But more of that later, here's a brief summary first (summary haters please find a humane way of fitting those tiny antlers to that mouse&#x85; thank you).Frank Cross is a young and ambitious TV executive. He has risen through the ranks to the position of President of the Network at the expense of his relationships with his family and his girl, Claire Phillips. They are to put on a live production of Dickens' 'A Christmas Carol', but they call it 'Scrooge' for some reason. This means everyone has to work on Christmas Eve... Not popular as you might guess. When Frank is visited by the ghost of his former boss, he is told he must change his ways. To this end he will be visited by three ghosts. These ghosts, The Ghosts of Christmas Past, Present and Future show Frank the error of his ways&#x85; But it's up to him to change.Although it's a pretty well produced film I did find it a little dated by today's standards. Yes, Bill Murray really pulled them in back in the day, but today I find him a little bit irritating. Having said that, he played the part of Frank Cross with great professionalism. It was the actors in the smaller parts I found more interesting; Carol Kane really gave her all as the Ghost of Christmas Present, Bobcat Goldthwait was great (as ever) as the unfortunate Eliot Loudermilk and it as nice to see Robert Mitchum as Studio owner, Preston Rhinelander. Oh, and I should also give an honourable mention to Karen Allen as Claire Phillips.I think part of the problem I have with this film is the Frank Cross character is so obnoxious that I find it really hard to have any empathy for him when he finally has his revelation. Maybe they took it a bit too far (for me), but having said that, there is still something about this film&#x85; or am I reliving my youth again?

Basically an American US TV station is planning a live Christmas Eve production of the Charles Dickens classic A Christmas Carol, but the guy making it all happen, programming executive Francis 'Frank' Xavier Cross (Bill Murray) is a cold-hearted, selfish and mean bigot. Having spent years being the way he is, and being Christmas Eve, he is visited by the spirit of his dead boss, Lew Hayward (John Forsythe) and told that he could be like him if he doesn't change. Just like the Dickens tale he also says Frank will be visited by three other ghosts to try and mend his ways and appreciate the Christmas spirit, and he ignores it at first thinking he was dozing. While walking around the television studio however, Frank is first visited by the cab driver Ghost of Christmas Past (David Johansen), who shows him his childhood and growing up, including falling in love Claire Phillips (Starman's Karen Allen), and ultimately becoming mean. Next is the life-size pixie Ghost of Christmas Present (Carol Kane) who shows Frank all the people who know him and he finds out what they really think of him behind his back. Finally the seven-foot-tall ghoul, The Ghost of Christmas Future shows Frank what will happen in the time to come if he doesn't make a difference to his life. Of course Frank returns to the TV studio with a change of heart, even interrupting the live broadcast to increase salaries and wish the viewers a Merry Christmas, and he shares a kiss with Claire.

Murray for the first half of the film is the kind of modern Scrooge you would expect with his sarcastic comments and humorous grouchy demeanour, but the rest of the film does indeed go into sentimental mush and get less funny, overall, I don't necessarily agree with the critics' three stars out of five, but not a terrible seasonal comedy.

Murray is OK in the role but he really can't carry the range of emotions necessary for us to really believe the story. In this version, he's a television network President who's been ding'd by Christmas pasts and has the bah humbug attitude towards the sacred day. He fires a worker who disagrees with his programming on Christmas with such unholy titles like The Day the reindeer died, where Lee Majors saves santa and the elves with firepower. This over-the-top stuff is not appropriate, of course, and so the head gives him someone else to help him with the work. He then starts seeing the ghosts and they supposedly are trying to help him see things straight. Murray's character also has a love interest, played by Karen Allen(who does nothing more than show her big brown eyes), to give him more motivation --- I guess. The movie is funny in spots, especially when Carol Kane plays the present ghost as a nice girl with a heavy boot, but the movie doesn't push through to all-out comedy in much other places. It doesn't go towards all-out drama either, so the viewer really doesn't have much to hold onto.

Those who are attracted by its cynicism can't seem to get past the sweet ending. Those who like the ending can't seem to get past the dark biting cynicism. Personally, I thought Donner did a great job marrying the two.The Scrooge tale is about reformation. A miserly man is given a third person view of his miserly life and where it will lead. Armed with insight and a second chance, he attacks his life anew. Its a fine supportable theme that reinforces a good message.Would this film have been better if the ending had challenged this notion? Maybe Frank Cross decides 'Ok... Be a miserly jerk now and burn in a box later... or be nice, charitable and ... huh... OK... what is my motivation here?' And with that, we close with him super-gluing antlers on a mouse. Funny? Yes. True to life? Well, more so than the sappy ending, that's for sure.The cynical ending is more in keeping with 1998 than 1988. Remember, in 1988, yuppism was new and in full swing. The late 20 and early 30-somethings were riding high on Reganomics and living for capitalism. It was such a new idea, that the soft underbelly of America felt it needed to remind the suits that it pays to have a heart. Interestingly enough, that was the mode of 1843, too when Dickens wrote his tale.1998 saw goth go mainstream. We saw our president lie about a sex scandal... Saving Private Ryan was the big movie of the year (a group of soldiers risk their lives to save one soldier who didn't want to be saved). America was in a more cynical mode. (7 years later, we're more cynical, still.) Would a cynical ending have been better? I believe it would have won more acclaim. I could see the critics slathering Scrooged with complements for its fresh take and keen insight... but better? I don't know. Personally, I like the movie just as it is.

When Dickens wrote the material on which this is based, either the world wasn't as overpopulated as it is today, or people weren't aware of it. Whichever option you prefer, painting people who prefer to place their financial independence over the seeming obligation to breed or marry as empty, soulless ne'er-do-wells was acceptable in those days.Unfortunately for Scrooged, this is not the nineteenth century, and the cultural values of today could not be more different. The world is overflowing with starving people, and speculation is rampant that we don't have the resources for our society to survive another century. To push the kind of values or ideals that Dickens' original story represents, as far as I am concerned, is offensive. I bet Dickens would be utterly modified to hear that I refuse to have children until science is advanced enough that I can edit diseases that run in my family, diabetes being the number one choice, out of their genetic structure.Where Scrooged rescues itself, however, is in the acting. Bill Murray seems to be having the time of his life playing the modern Ebeneezer. In some scenes, he takes hammy overacting to a typically Murray-esque level. When he's confronted by the Christmas ghosts, on the other hand, he plays some of it so deadpan that it adds to the hilarity. Bob Goldthwait gets a brilliant cameo as the just-sacked employee. He's still squealing and almost screaming, but by his standards, this is a refreshingly restrained performance.Another problem with the film is that there seem to be a lot of missed opportunities. The script just seems to play everything not for laughs so much as to get from one scene to the next. Which is a big shame, as the material had so much potential for comedy, especially given its cast. A few wisecracks from Murray is simply not enough effort. Especially not compared to some of the sight gags from previous gems on Murray's resumé. Even Police Academy 4 was funnier overall than this pedestrian exercise, in spite of being made for less than a quarter of the money, and with considerably more questionable talent at that.If you're going to see Scrooged, see it for one reason. Bill Murray's performance is the rock upon which this entire comedy rests. His performance during his meeting with the ghost of Christmas Future, as one-sided as it is, makes one wonder how Bill Murray would perform a meeting with Terry Pratchett's Death. Karen Allen gets a turn here as the obligatory overstated love interest, and she does alright with what she is given. Unfortunately, her character is so underwritten that she only serves as a plot device, which serves to make point one (the get yeself hitcheded now, mister message) all the more aggravating.I gave Scrooged a seven out of ten. This score contains two bonus points for Bill Murray, and one for Bob Goldthwait. If it weren't for these two taking turns at injecting some genuine comedy, Scrooged would be very difficult to watch.

You're life might just depend on it.Christmas Specials are a big deal, with some of them (such as Charlie Brown and The Grinch) going down in TV history. When it comes to story a lot of lazy staff writers just milk the Christmas Carol goat and there are millions of different takes out there to prove it with Roseanne and the original Star Trek series all doing their own rip-offs. IBC boss Frank Cross (Bill Murray dressed up as Steven Seagal's long-lost twin brother) is a delightfully wicked man of hate who is planning his very own live broadcast of said story. Little does he know that very tale is about to wind its way into his life.Why I like Frank Cross is because he's a lot like me. He's mean to those beneath him, yields power with a ruthless swagger and is sarcastic to just about everyone. If you disagree with him in even the slightest, tiniest little way he'll fire you. Just like I would. But on this certain Xmas Eve life is getting very weird for him.The owner of the station is doubting his abilities to undertake such a heavy production, a slimy Californian director is trying to muscle-in on his job and his dead boss comes back to haunt him. He brings an important message that if he doesn't change his way he's going to hell and that three ghosts, of Xmas past, present and future, are going to show him the results of his evilness.In the hands of just another comedy director this would have been a missed opportunity, but Richard Donner shoots the film as a supernatural fantasy and gives it a pretty superior shine. Something Brian Levant could never do. And let's not forget Bill Murray, the guy is a genius no matter what he does and he dominates the whole film with his loud an maniacal performance. Everything he says seems to be ad-libbed and babbles some brilliant one-liners and sarcasm.Most people are put-off by the ending and claim that when the nastiness stops and sentiment kicks in the film goes downhill. I don't feel this way. In a world where Xmas is commercialised and the time of year where people go in huge debt we need a constant reminder of what we should be feeling. No one is asking you to celebrate the fact that Wal-Mart are selling cheap turkeys or that greedy stores have a limited stock of $700 X-Boxes. At the end Frank Cross, the world's biggest scrooge and non-believer, tells us that it's the fun, the determination to make a difference, the easiness of changing someone's life and the spirit of the holiday season that really matters. You don't have to hate it and if you surrender your pride and just give it a go then maybe the miracle to happen to you to.For me, Scrooged has been an annual tradition for years and will continue to be so. Not only is it very funny but, in its own way, very important. If you give a little, you can get back a whole lot more. Sounds corny, I know but Xmas is what you make it.

I am a great fan of Bill Murray (Groundhog Day is a great favorite of mine), and I don't mind his mugging cynicism at all.  But his character in this movie is hateful.  At no time do I care about him, even in the flashback with his family, which, I suppose, is designed to tug at our heartstrings.  His epiphany is silly and insincere, making the last ten minutes an eternity. The charm of A Christmas Carol is that Scrooge once had love in his soul, but it needed to be let out through self discovery.  As Bill Murray invites people to join him, he is still smirking--doing Saturday Night Live schtick--making fun of his own movie.  Even if this is intended as a parody of the original, it is so cold, it doesn't work.

Once the executive (played by Bill Murray) gets a heart, so to speak, then it's time for everybody to feel better about the world and remember what Christmas is about, exactly.And just like most other ridiculous Christmas creations out there, it is itself a product of the very thing it claims to be warning against. Sure, Murray learns his lesson. Sure, sensationalist advertising-saturated promo creation is a Bad Thing (r)(tm). So why mix that message in with a big ol' dolloping of crude humor, sexual innuendo, and spastic cynicism? Oh, because it's making fun of all of that. And selling it at the same time. Or something.Bill Murray also is at a career low here. I don't know how precisely he managed to do this, but his delivery in this film makes Groundhog Day seem like a bigger, more important holiday than Christmas. This is a vehicle of the worst sort a movie meant to sell with star power, where the star basically plays himself, but the movie doesn't care enough about what it's doing to give the star any room to shine, and as a result the star just gets repetitive and obnoxious in his role. Probably the best example of this is the Oh, I get it now! monologue at the end, which never really says anything and keeps going on and on as Murray stumbles around throwing out ideas that are less revealing than the ones given to him in the spectral visits.By the time this movie ends, one can't help but anticipate the credits to see who's responsible for this stupidity. Surprisingly, it's Richard Donner, of Goonies and Superman II fame.

Debit those items and work on the script for more laughs and this film could score well. The funny parts are when Murray's character, Frank Cross, slips in and out of his trips with the ghosts, only to find himself in the middle of the stage set or rehearsal or broadcasting, and fouling it up. His change doesn't seem very believable. And the ending is a sappy effort to bring the story to happy conclusion. If one wants a lot of laughs for a Christmas season movie, try Christmas Vacation 1989, Christmas in Connecticut 1945, or Christmas with the Kranks 2004.

Scrooge didn't quit being a man of business, give everything away, and take a vow of poverty. He simply stopped being less of a turd head and more of a Mensch. It's a lesson that resonates as much today as it did in 1843. It's that our choice isn't necessarily between two extremes -- socialism and Ayn Rand. There is a middle road that some of us seem unwilling to recognize.I think this is what Hollywood called a high concept movie. A Christmas Carol has been done to death. It's been done seriously and made into a musical. Now it's time for another telling of the tale, but this time let's make it a comedy with a the usual sentimental ending.There are a horde of recognizable faces on the screen, from Robert Mitchum to John Housemann, but the movie belongs to Bill Murray as the modern Scrooge, head of IBC who insists on a live broadcast of A Christmas Carol on Christmas Eve, even though everyone knows that people should be enjoying their family dinners and not glued to the telly.Frankly, it didn't sound promising. And in fact it had its unfunny violent slapstick moments, as when the Spirit of Christmas Present, Carol Kane, kicks Murray in the family jewels and drops him howling to the floor. That's not the only example of mayhem that pushes the envelope.Yet, even though we know what's going to happen, it's possible to get swept up into the story. There are, of course, CGIs but they don't overwhelm us. They're used judiciously, which is refreshing in itself. And Murray just can't be too serious, especially during the cornier moments when he should be. As the end credits role over Murray standing on the TV set and surrounded by cast and crew, all singing Get A Little Love In Your Heart, an emetic scene in itself, Murray addresses the camera and shouts things like, Okay, now just the people on the left side of the theater! And then he shouts for All the women! No, no -- the REAL women! It sounds as if he's deliberately sabotaging the clichéd scene and, in the process, bringing a little subversion to all the painful joy. FEED ME, Seymour!, he shouts. It has nothing to do with the story but it's an allusion to The Little Shop of Horrors in which Murray played the part of a dentist's pain freak. Still, Murray's efforts to undercut the clichés notwithstanding, it goes on too long. Nobody, not even Santa Claus, could have relieved the distress of that ending.It's not a masterpiece but a lot of effort has gone into it, it's sometimes actually touching and sometimes quite funny, and there are gags that work.

Murray plays a hardboiled TV executive who only sees Christmas as a commercial opportunity to get the best ratings. The usual ghosts from Christmases past, present, and future visit Murray and in a more contemporary idiom explain the error of his ways. No need to explain this universally beloved plot, I think other than the Christmas story itself, more people know this story than any other in the English speaking world.A couple of Hollywood veterans John Forsythe and Robert Mitchum have some nice supporting roles. Both are TV executives, Forsythe from his past and who Bill Murray was something of a protégé. Robert Mitchum is the Bill Paley/David Sarnoff network tycoon and who already sees some flaws in Murray's approach and is grooming a smarmy John Glover to take his place.The Bob Cratchit part is split in two with Murray's secretary going home to a not so Merry Christmas with the family when the expected bonus she was counting on doesn't materialize, she gets a network monogrammed towel like everyone else. She's played by Alfre Woodard and she's drowning in some real 20th century debt. The junior executive Murray fires is Bobcat Goldthwait and he doesn't take his Christmas Eve sacking in the resigned frame of mind the original Cratchit it. As this is the ever zany Goldthwait his method of dealing with it is unorthodox.The spirits of the past, present, and future are played by David Johanssen, Carol Kane, and Michael J. Pollard. Of the three and in fact in the film Carol Kane is the best. She certainly has an original way of getting one's attention.Karen Allen plays the girl that Murray loved and lost and Scrooged gives him an interesting opportunity to make that up as well as change his way of living. Scrooged is first and foremost a Bill Murray show and Bill Murray delivers on all levels. All the spirit of Dickens is maintained, in fact when the cast in the finale starts singing Put A Little Love In Your Heart over the closing credits, isn't that what Charles Dickens meant to say what Christmas does?

Since It's A Wonderful Life, how many festive flicks have you seen based around this premise. Personally, I blame Charles Dickens but even he won't have predicted this modern update on his novel A Christmas Carol. But is it any good, even with Hollywood's best curmudgeon as the lead? As Christmas Eve comes round again, professional Grinch and TV exec Frank Cross (Bill Murray) plans a live TV extravaganza adapting A Christmas Carol, focusing on scaring everybody in the name of ratings. Trouble is, Frank isn't really a Christmas person as he fires young Eliot Loudermilk (Bobcat Goldthwait) and harasses his overworked secretary (Alfre Woodard). His miserly ways even keep his ex, charity worker Claire (Karen Allen), at arms length. But Frank is soon visited by three ghosts, all of whom are determined to show Frank the error of his ways and reignite the true meaning of Christmas.Scrooged might not be as off-message as Bad Santa but as Murray shouts, rants and flies off the handle in spectacular fashion, it's hard not to be swept up in the film's message - no matter how many times you've heard it before. We all know Murray can carry a film by himself as anyone who has seen Groundhog Day will testify so it's a little surprising to find others raising their game as well. Allen is good as the sweet-as-cherry-pie love interest as is Carol Kane as the Ghost Of Christmas Present and David Johansen as the Ghost Of Christmas Past. But what impressed me the most is the thought and detail which has gone into this film. The Ghost Of Christmas Future is a genuinely unsettling presence and some of the effects are actually very good, despite the age of the film.So why aren't I head over heels in love with this film? Well, it's entirely predictable and in my opinion, too sentimental at the end. And like Jim Carrey, how much you'll enjoy the movie depends on how long you can handle Murray's breakneck performance because as much as I like Murray, he did begin to grate towards the end and he dominates the picture like a seasoned comic professional. Maybe I'm nit-picking because I did enjoy Scrooged but personally, I feel that there are better Christmas films out there and better Bill Murray films out there. It seems a shame to say it because this is funny, feel-good festive fun. I guess what I wanted was another Groundhog Day which is a classic Bill Murray film that also revolves around the redemption of a grumpy sourpuss but is much funnier and more inventive.

All this means he is due for a visit by three ghosts, bent on showing him the error of his ways. But is Cross too cynical even for them?Funny how things work out. Murray was reportedly unhappy with Scrooged, as was director Richard Donner and co-screenwriter Michael O'Donoghue, one of Saturday Night Live's darkest and most legendary figures. Yet maybe because of the behind-the-scenes turmoil, including a release date so delayed two principal cast members were already dead when it came out, Scrooged works beautifully as one of filmdom's strangest salutes to the Christmas spirit.What's great about Scrooged? You have to start with Murray, who nails Cross with a combination of sneering sarcasm and bitter one-liners. Even when his old boss, Lew Hayward (John Forsyth), strolls into his office seven years after suffering a fatal heart attack, Cross doesn't budge.Gah, has it been that long? Cross says. To look at you, I wouldn't have guessed more than three, tops.Forsyth's funnier than I've ever seen him, but the ace make-up job alerts you to the fact this is one Christmas Carol remake that's playing for serious stakes. One reason I think the film failed to find greater popularity is it confused people expecting a Yuletide Ghostbusters to see Murray stuck inside a coffin, begging to live.But for those who stick with it, and allow for the off-chance that through its bizzaro comedy it may strike the odd chord, Scrooged works terrifically well at challenging us about how cynicism and despair are ruts one needs to kick oneself out of, and that life in the end may boil down to something as simple as put a little love in your heart.That's why the ending works so well for me, because it really does much the same thing Dickens did 150 years ago, risking a little strenuousness for the sake of a message about self-betterment. It's especially striking when one considers O'Donoghue's normal family sensibilities ran along the lines of promo announcements for shows like The Waltons Eat Their Young.You get similar promo comedy at the start of Scrooged, along with Robert Mitchum as the network boss who counsels Frank about strategic programming for cats What about a cop that dangles string? I think O'Donoghue enjoyed the television satire especially, though he may indulge himself a little too much at the expense of a network censor.Carol Kane and David Johansen shine as two of the Christmas spirits, while Karen Allen adds a lot of heart as the girl Cross left behind on his road to success. The film is shambolic, cluttered, and a lot of jokes fall flat, but there are a lot of other jokes that score, as well as an underlying message to exterminate the humbug in the hardest of hearts.For some, A Christmas Story and It's A Wonderful Life may be an annual event, but for me, there can be no seasonal substitute for the twisted Chrismas carol that is Scrooged.

Bill plays the role of a disgruntled Frank Cross who is the modern day Ebenezer Scrooge, except he owns a TV studio. And he does a lot of mean things to people, I like the commercial part it's the best part, but there's more, the spirits that visit him, the ghost of Christmas past is the guy from Car 54. And John Glover of 52 Pick Up and Bobcat Goldwaith of Police Academy are in it too! Bobcat is like the Bob Critchit in this one only with a gun! Anyways, this is a very funny holiday film next to It's A Wonderful Life or the classic version and Disney version of A Christmas Carol or the Grinch or that funny episode on Just Shoot Me where Finch acts like THE GRINCH! Recommended for the family to watch, but there's a bit of bad language, maybe the parents with the kids, that is. This maybe from the '80s and old, but it sure gives you that holiday spirit, and it does make you feel all warm inside and funny on the funny bone too!

This so called comedy made me angry. Bill Murray plays an extremely mean and cold hearted TV exec who plans on spending Christmas Eve by putting on a live broadcast of Scrooge but soon he's visited by three ghosts who will try and teach him the true meaning of the holiday. Okay, I know this movie was a critical failure when it was released but in the past several years it has gained a large cult following. That's fine but I'm not one of them. I really can't remember the last comedy I watched that really made my blood boil and get me this angry. I thought the film started off fairly bad and just grew worse with each passing second. I don't mind that this was a complete rape of the Dickens story as even the cutest or nicest story can have an adult twist to it. I also don't mind the rather profane sections of this film. I really didn't mind anything going on here except for the fact that none of it was funny. I really couldn't believe how unfunny this movie was but I think a lot of the blame has to go towards director Donner as it seems each scene in the movie is just grasping for laughs. The entire film is so uneven that each scene just seems out of control with it trying to get laughs. The entire screenplay is over the top yet it never really seems to know if it wants to go all out or just stay low key. To me the film really came off as some weird mixture of adult humor that tries not to go too far where it would earn an R-rating. Perhaps this film would have been better had it gone all out but I'm not sure if Donner could have handled that either. As far as Murray goes, there's two ways too look at it. I guess you could say he gives a brilliant performance as the evil exec, which is good for him but it hurts the movie because you hate this guy so much that you really don't want to spend any time looking at him. The thing with the Dickens story is that we could see some good at the bottom of Scrooge's meanness but I never felt that with this guy. Karen Allen, John Forsythe, Bobcat Goldthwait, Carol Kane, Michael J. Pollard, Alfre Woodard and Robert Mitchum are all wasted in supporting roles. Every cult movie is going to have people that love it and people that hate it. This is one that I ended up hating.

It was also disturbing, sad, and not afrraid to be mean-spirited at times. This was perfect as it fleshed out Murray's character. As soon as it started I knew its quality rested almost completely on Bill Murray's shoulders. The problem is that the ending seems too happy for the biting, darkness that came before it, especially coming from Bill Murray. Since it's considered a more or less a comedy, I almost wondered if the ending was tongue-in-cheek. But then, that would have made it slightly depressing, which is why to this day I am not sure I like it on its own.You can tell that since Bill probably didn't like the ending he figured he should still keep the integrity of the script by playing Francis as though he had gone insane. The way he played the character in spite of the sappy ending, in itself, is what I feel truly showcases Bill Murray's talent.Don't get me wrong~I like many sappy Christmas movies; but this one started at the other end of the spectrum and could have done so much more with more subtlety at the end.

In fact, I love dark comedies and think Frank Cross is the movie's saving grace (Bill Murray's brilliance manages to shine through mediocrity once again).I think the problem is that this movie just not nearly as funny as it thinks it is. Much of it is tedious and labored. Some think Carol Kane is hilarious, but I found her downright annoying (I think she is better in less broad comedic roles). And the level of violence is just gratuitous and takes way too much away from the comedy. The only time it is effective in creating comedy is in the opening sequence for the Lee Major's movie.

While he wrote a tale of a cold-hearted businessman who was mean but whose actions were actually not that atypical for the time, making it a commentary on the evils of conscienceless capitalism, this Bill Murray vehicle is an attack not on general cruelty but on TV executives, and comes across as what it is; a TV writer's fantasy revenge, in which executives are sadists and censors are targets.While Scrooge was hard-hearted, he considered himself a good man of business who kept emotion and feeling out of the workplace. Murray's character, on the other hand, is pretty much a psychopath, gleefully spying on a suffering ex-employee in the parking lot. This makes his eventual transformation unlikely, and makes the movie more about not being a jerk than about being good and charitable.But while this movie has none of the message of the Dickens story, on its own it's actually quite fun, a fast paced, goofy comedy with entertaining special effects and good performances.

It's fast-paced, refreshingly mean-spirited, and quite simply good fun.The main reason for this film's success is, of course, Bill Murray, delivering a delightfully deadpan turn as an absolutely villainous character. His Frank Cross is the epitome of '80s-era greed and commercialism, and Murray nails it from the outset. It helps that he's given great support (the underrated Karen Allen and Bobcat Goldthwait in particular), but this is the Murray show through and through.Okay, so watched today, some of the special effects look a little rubbery, and some of the schmaltzy stuff feels a little twee, but it doesn't matter. SCROOGED has a great script, lots of successful gags that come thick and fast, and another good turn from the reliable Murray. What's not to love?NB. I rewatched this film once more to see how it holds up in high definition. It looks a treat, and the '80s-style special effects are fine and pleasingly macabre. However, I think Murray's shouty performance is a bit too much. It's not the actor's fault, but rather director Richard Donner's, who insisted on everything being dialled up to 11. I think if the film had been a little more subtle and nuanced it would have been an all-time classic; as it stands it's merely a fun and snappy '80s variant on the famous storyline.

Take a list  the acting was so over the top, and not comic. The editing, and Ohh I'm so furious, was not helping at all, making the whole matter like a hysterical spasm. There is no calm moment, or a station to stop. I was during all the time out of breath badly ! Feeling exactly like Murray himself being slapped all the time by disgusting fairy. I hated that obvious rough cuts, it feels like a long nightmare already. It's whether a case of disharmony between the script and the directing, or it's a case of studio got the movie some reediting in the nick of time. Richard Donner (one of my favorites) dealt with it as an explosive action but it didn't seem to fit. It's close to fool slapstick or mad cartoon, without even being funny or thrilling. It reached its highest peck of being silly and unbearable while the scenes of the fairy. True that I laughed at the way the movie treated the censorship's delegate (most of them deserve it !) but along with a few of Murray's lines that was it!. Generally (Donner) is a master of action, no doubt about that, but when it comes to comedy, he's obviously not. I'm sorry that he also produced it. The script could have terminated lots of things. Not to mention making some alterations (the lead's lover left him because he wanted to go with her to his boss's dinner instead of their friends' dinner !!). Or not making it highly predictable also. Basically I believe the main problem here was about the actual personality of the movie which's ranging between a real black comedy for adults, or that peaceful moral fairytale for children (read  all the viewers). The final result was a nervous twisted play; it's all in Bill Murray's unstoppable screaming that disgraced a fine comedian and actor like him, and caused me an effective headache as well. I know it's well-meaning, feel-good, Christmas's miracle movie, but it looked like playing Deck the Halls in fast speed endlessly till you yell out of torture  when will it end ?! It's nearly how not to make this kind of movies, despite some good potentials it had. Regrettably (Scrooged) is a complete frantic pandemonium, and not even in a good way.

Like I said, that's what drew me.Now all I can say is people, learn from my mistakes and DON'T WATCH SCROOGED!To say that Murray is wrong in his part as network head honcho Frank Cross isn't comment enough - he approaches it as if he was right in the middle of something important and wants to hurry back to it.  He's mean, nasty, irritable, cranky, foul-natured, hostile, violent and disrepectful.  Usually, those are positive qualities in his movies, but here they are not.  Everyone he is in the same frame with seems to consider him like that passenger in coach who complains about everything, yells at the stewardesses and hasn't bathed in a week.  Maybe they're right, I dunno.Then there's the tone of the story - does it want to be a parody of A Christmas Carol or a retelling?  It fails at both because they never find a consistent tone and stick with it.  It's slapstick, then it's maudlin; it's satire, then it's love story; it's sentiment then everyone breaks into song.  WHAT THE...??!  If the film-makers weren't sure about how to make the film, how should we know how to take it?And finally, there's the wisdom of a comedy where a child is struck mute after his father is killed, a homeless person freezes to death and an old lady dies of a heart attack after watching one of Cross' (Murray's) paranoia-driven commercials for his network's production of Scrooge.  This is a holiday comedy?  I haven't even mentioned the part where he steals another woman's taxi then flips her off as he rides away.  Ho ho ho.This is about the most depressing holiday movie I've ever seen; enough to put you off your egg nog.  Any good parts?  Well - Forsythe in the Jacob Marley part has a good first scene, Allen is radiance and light as an old girlfriend who loves her Lumpy, and Kane is a fantastic Ghost of Christmas Present by the sole virtue that she gets to beat the holy beans out of Murray with her fists, uppercuts him with a toaster, knocks him down a flight of stairs, slaps him, electrically zaps his ears, plants a nice firm kick right where you'd expect and tries to rip his bottom lip off.  God, I love that woman.Other than that, nothing.  Not a thing that celebrates the season, goodwill, peace, love, charity, the Christmas spirit, and not one mention of the original source material Dickens NEVER wrote a story called Scrooge.BTW, wasn't there a musical made with Albert Finney called Scrooge?  Maybe they missed a good bet, here.Two stars only for Scrooged - one for Murray (he's worth one, anyway) and another for Robert Goulet's Down-Home Cajun Christmas Special.  Now THAT I'd like to see.

It's so disgustingly hypocritical.  Plus, I have nothing against Bill Murray personally, but there are very few characters that he plays that I find either likeable or funny.  The patient in Little Shop of Horrors - that's funny; Jeff in Tootsie - a support role, but brilliantly played;  Groundhog Day - a well written movie where his character ultimately redeems himself.  Come to think of it, that's the theme of Scrooged, but Groundhog Day does it better, without the sentimental posturing.Scrooged does have its good points.  Grace's family scenes, the ghosts, the homeless shelter scene.  This could have been a good movie, if the over-the-top schmaltz at the end had just been cut down to size.

In this scenario, wisecracking, rapid-fire Bill Murray is a good fit as a rotten TV network executive. He's initially a hoot, but the visiting ghosts and the constant stream of chattering characters weighs Scrooged down like an old fruitcake. Murray, pulling out all the stops, is a hearty actor who knows a great deal about nuance, but here his worst tendencies are encouraged and often he's just a nuisance. Karen Allen is a sweet love-interest and Alfre Woodard is wonderful as a harried secretary, but too many in the large supporting cast get stuck over-projecting in minor roles that don't call for so much caustic mania (Carol Kane and Bobcat Goldthwait are the biggest offenders). John Glover's sniveling villain is pitched so far over the top that he's not even a fun bad guy; the great Robert Mitchum is given nothing but weak material. Full of peaks and valleys, Scrooged is overly-dark and alienating, with an unshakable sense of claustrophobic smugness. ** from **** "},{"Title":"Bah Humbug!","Date":"23 September 2002","Score":"3 out of 12 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Drama, Fantasy","Review":"  (Possible spoilers) SCROOGED is the cinematic equivalent of coal in your stocking, a disheartening experience that sours your feelings about the Yuletide season. If this film conveys the true meaning of Christmas, I don't want to observe this holiday.The concept is promising- Charles Dickens's A Christmas Carol updated for the 1980s with Scrooge as a callous, ratings-mad television executive. And the film gets off to a great start with hilarious promos for The Night the Reindeer Died about Santa battling terrorists and Robert Goulet's Old-Fashioned Cajun Christmas. But from there, the movie generally goes downhill.Part of the problem, as a previous reviewer has noted, is that SCROOGED doesn't know whether to honor or skewer Dickens's story.  By constantly fluctuating between iconoclastic humor and earnest sweetness, the movie not only reveals the filmmakers' lack of focus, but their cynical desire to pander to both sentimentalists and scoffers. This only results in a meandering muddle.What ultimately ruins SCROOGED is Bill Murray's surprisingly bad performance in the lead.  Most of the time when he's mean, he's humorless and unpleasant.  Murray doesn't even convey an interesting ruthlessness that made Alastair Sim's pre-reformation Scrooge so compelling. He's just an unbearable boor.  And in his tender moments, Murray's too detached to be moving.He is at his worst in the final scene where he proclaims his love for Christmas on live television.  There's no joy in his speech, just desperation.  It's enough to make one empathize with the pre-reformation Scrooge.If you rever Dickens' original story, watch a straightforward adaption, especially the 1951 Alastair Sim version. If you're in the mood for holiday satire, watch BLACKADDER'S CHRISTMAS CAROL. Whatever your mood, I doubt you'll find SCROOGED satisfying. "},{"Title":"A mean spirited and ugly little movie. Not any kind of a holiday movie.","Date":"17 December 2002","Score":"6 out of 19 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Drama, Fantasy","Review":"  I disliked this movie when it first appeared 14 years ago. I've just now seen part of it again, and like a bloody car accident scene, I couldn't turn away. But afterwards I felt dirty and polluted--- as if I needed to take a shower. I had forgotten how truly mean spirited and ugly this glob of vile really was. Yuck! And not to forget... Ewwwww.Karen Allen and Alfre Woodward are both such beautiful people--- hot babes, of course, but also fine spirited and good hearted folks. What were they doing in this disaster? I bet that either someone tricked them into it, or else 1988 was a lean year for them somehow, and they were desperate for money. And Annie Lennox! She sang the wonderful closing credits theme song--- Put a Little Love In Your Heart. Boy--- Scrooged is such a filthy disservice to those three marvelous ladies--- Karen, Alfre, and Annie. What a crime!Bill Murray may have some appeal for some people. But for myself, he makes my skin crawl. Please don't make the mistake of falling for the theme this movie is advertised under. It is NOT any kind of holiday movie you'd ever want to show any child, nor any loved one. Excuse me now, I must go and shower for about a week... "}]
