Michael Caine is the Dr Higgins figure grooming her for stardom. Shatner plays Shatner, and Bergen is the matron of the Pageant. Benjamin Bratt plays the love interest !Bullock is excellent all the way through from uncouth to gorgeous, and is particularly stunning in her transformed self.

Sandra Bullock is an actress who falls into the latter category.  Yet, in this category, she is at the top of the tree and it is in films such as Miss Congeniality that she proves this.For a fish out of water comedy, this is a film that plays to Bullock's qualities - her tomboy image from Speed, her warm humour and her ability to play for laughs and be deadpan.  As such, Bullock is allowed to shine from a castlist containing Michael Caine and Ben Bratt.  However, if I had one criticism, it would be that there are occasions when Caine just appears to be shamelessly mugging and camping it up for the camera to no real effect.There are some genuinely funny moments, mostly centred around the pageant and it is nice to see such a movie which doesn't take itself or its setting too seriously.  Many of the contestants give good supporting performances and as such, it is hard to pick one out.Overall, it is a bit slight but anyone renting/buying this movie would surely know what to expect - familiar, funny and essentially sweet-natured - just like Sandra Bullock herself.8/10 - A good example of the genre.

Even taking into account that it was 10 years ago when this Rom-Com was released, and most Rom-Coms are forgotten throughout the sands of time by plenty of people for how many there are and how unremarkable most of them manage to be, this one has always managed to stick with me and uphold an excellent reputation, in my eyes, for how wonderful and fun it really is, and is truly one of my favorite movies in general.The numerous upsides I think the deliverance of all the lines and scenes in this film is just perfect for what it sets out to accomplish. Sandra Bullock was the perfect choice for the role, and all the other supporting actors and actresses are simply magnificent in their parts and bring to you a movie that is meant to be nothing but fun and laughter from the beginning. However, you get a little bit more than what you are in store for. I found myself being completely interested every time I have watched it over the years, because it captures your attention with the storyline and antics and does not let go. The performances, like I said, are amazing and the cast really knew how to work with what they were given. The jokes and antics are hysterical and though many when they hate or dislike a comedy will tell you that the movie was funny in a bad way, do not listen to any bad reception this may receive and view it for yourself with a clear conscience, because it really is enjoyable that way, in my honest opinion.The very minuscule, few downsides Yes, the movie does get a tad bit mediocre, at times, and at others of course they could have handled the material a little better, but aside from those two matters, I thought the film was, in a sense, perfect, and was completely astonishing and surprisingly hilarious and outstanding to every value it should have been hilarious and outstanding to.I have enjoyed the film for a long time now, I still enjoy it and find it to be a fun and thrilling adventure from beginning to end that I can always watch for the simple pleasure of just viewing it, not to just pass the time. Guys, do not pass it off for just a chick flick, because a few are liable to find this a superbly well time.

The opening moments, with FBI agent Bullock busting Russians in a restaurant sting operation, are so good that the movie might've played very well as an FBI comedy-drama, with Bullock on different cases. I mean, maybe they should've ditched the pageant stuff, at least until next time. But, no, Bullock goes undercover as a contestant in the Miss U.S. pageant, and the movie turns into your typical makeover thing. Lots of breast jokes, TOO many high heel pratfalls, and Michael Caine as a peculiar makeover artist (he's dripping with disdain one minute, fatherly the next, then bitter, then cuddly). Bullock has no chemistry with Benjamin Bratt as her boss on the operation (that's not her fault, however) and I wanted more of her home life (and that doomed microwave oven), but what works does work well. Sandra's bonding paint party with the girls is terrific, as is her friendship with shaky Miss Rhode Island and her attempts to face down snarling Ernie Hudson as the FBI chieftain (who, like in Ghostbusters, gets no funny lines). The movie rests solely on Bullock's shoulders, and she delivers.

When writers are in charge, we have scripts about writing, like `Wonder Boys or `Finding Forrester.' When actors are in charge, the plot device is usually about acting. That's why so many Shakespeare plays have people in disguises.If you are a film actor in Hollywood, you have a hard choice to make. For someone like Bullock, you can either become a personality or an actor, a real actor. Kate Winslet has chosen to be a real actor. Sandra wishes she could be, but we won't give her a chance. It has little to do with talent, its just a matter of whether the personality is marketable. If it is, we force these folks into a box. So she (and Roberts and Ryan, and so so many other women) are mere personalities.As an aside I really admire Brad Pitt who is in this for the long run, and who seeks out adventuresome, risk-taking roles just because the draw to be a relatively worthless personality (like say Harrison Ford) is so great. And he needs to work hard to avoid it.What we like about Bullock is what we think she is `really' like, perky and fun, so we refuse to see her in dramatic roles. The good side is that you make oodles of money as a personality. The bad side is you are reduced to a barking seal, for instance in Julia's case forever working that smile. These people hate their box (unless they are really, really dumb, but we won't mention names). And the game is risky because the big movies that depend on these `openers' have to be different in some way. So the problem is how to have a familiar personality in a slightly different vehicle.You can see just how the wheels turned for this film as Bullock tried to get ahead. This time instead of Sandra's character being a pretty airhead, we'll have her play a character pretending to be one! That way, we can make fun of the box, people will come, and we can show the actual process of acting. Along the way of making fun of the box, we can poke fun at the viewers, who here literally gather around a screen and gawk.To drive the inside joke home, get Candice Bergen to play the conservative Texan villain who is behind the airhead enterprise. (Her goal is to make the winner a literal airhead.) This is the modern Jane Fonda liberal who took on Dan Quale when he had real influence, and won! This is the girl who, and whose dad, considered her to be sibling to Charlie, a true performing airhead personality. No one in the business would fail to get this joke.Add in a Frick and Frack Caine who is a very fine non-personality actor who `tutors' our performer, and Shatner who is making a career poking fun at his own salable personality, which happens to be as a fatuous dope. Okay, those are the key pieces. All else is plot machinery to support these roles, plus a few elements of humor and charm from the stock library.Its much more interesting watching what the movie is really about than watching the movie itself. At least in this case.

But what works, works, and the first hour of build up, and of Bullock's transformation (and her sparks of humor and authenticity through it all) are first rate. Michael Caine supports her as he supports everyone in the business, with class and finesse. Benjamin Bratt, playing a kind of distant love interest for Bullock's FBI agent cum beauty contestant, is a little to aware of his good looks and doesn't quite relax enough to make him a star. He could learn a lot from Caine and Bullock, who are both consummate actors capable of saving, and even lifting up, a mostly routine production. For lightweight fare, it's a joy. By the way, the only Miss United States beauty pageant is an on-line contest, with a hefty entry fee, and seems to be a commercial and possibly exploitive tie-in to the movie. The famous (and infamous) national pageants are Miss America and Miss USA. This movie is meant to play off the stereotypes of what the contestants are often like, and it provides for some pretty good fodder.

When I was growing up one of the yearly television events I always recalled was the Miss America pageant (as well as the other beauty pageant for Miss Universe). Watching Bert Parks' singing the Miss America song was on the same level as watching the Thanksgiving Day parade or the Superbowl. In fact, when Parks was fired from Miss America in the 1980s, the pageant lost many viewers out of sympathy with Bert. But that dropping of Parks was an example of what the producers of the show faced in the 1980s. There had been dwindling interest and ratings for several years. Many felt the show was old fashioned because of the idiotic talent sections and the stupid questions (QuestionWhat do you wish for?; Usual answer World peace!). Others, especially feminists, were put off by the idea that the contests were demeaning meat markets displaying women for sex purposes only - and not really emphasizing women's brains. The pageants are still around, but they lack the exposure they had back in the 1950s, 1960s, and 1970s. Even recent scandals have made one question the entire idea more (the best known Miss America of the last twenty years was Vanessa Williams, who lost the title for an infraction of the rules, and subsequently had a successful - and still flourishing - acting career something that rarely happens to the regular winners).Here, there has been a bombing (and killing) at the Miss United States beauty pageant. As a result an FBI team is assigned to figure out who did this. The team happens to find evidence that suggests a Unibomber type did, but they don't know for certain. One of the recent recruits, Sandra Bullock, is to enter the contest as Miss New Jersey. This is done with the knowledge of the contest's chairperson and spokeswoman (and former Miss United States) Candace Bergen. Bergen is not happy about the choice Bullock is all professional FBI agent, with little in the way of a sense of fun, and absolutely no sense of style or even rudimentary knowledge of make-up. The FBI team, headed by Benjamin Bratt, assigns a former member of the Miss United States pageant (Michael Caine) to prettify and prepare Bullock for her assignment. It almost leads to mutual murder. Caine is a man of style and knows what wins contest audiences. Nothing he sees about Bullock remotely covers this. Bullock finds Caine insulting (he admits to a stylish elitism), and she finds the new regimen impossible. Not only must she learn some talent (they finally pick up on her playing the musical glasses, like Ben Franklin's armonica), but she has to walk with poise, be graceful, and keep her weight under control (some of the best jokes deal with her constant attempts at stealing donuts when she is supposed to be eating carrots and vegetables). She is also trying to see the value of the contest. Bullock believes in the modern age of feminism, and works hard at being a good agent. She sees the contest as a sexist, out-of-date affair. She also notes it brings out the worst in the other contestants, most of whom are basically good types but are now taking cheap shots at each other in efforts to win the contest. She is particularly protective about Miss Rhode Island (Heather Burns), who seems to have self-confidence problems and hopes to improve herself by winning the contest.Bullock is also finding her current job annoying in a non-professional manner she and Bratt are both attracted to each other, but she can't find any time to make time for him (nor he for her). If they get together it is for the business of finding the bomber threatening the contest, or for Bratt taking a sullen Bullock for training sessions with a snooty Caine. This is hardly a good way to develop a love affair.Finally there is the problem of Candace Bergen - a long time supporter of the contest, she sees it as actually helping the winners by giving them scholarships that can assist them in furthering careers in all professions (and thus raising the image of women). And she resents the all-to-easy dismissal Bullock keeps bringing up when she shows what she thinks of the contest.The film also has it's version of Parks, in it's traditional host played by William Shatner. Certainly not the same as his Captain Kirk or even (currently) Denny Crane, Shatner's Stan Fields has a popular following among the older generation, who like his pleasant inane jokes (you can tell after awhile what he's going to say as a joke), and his singing the theme song. His performance is like additional icing on the cake. And a well made cake it is. "},{"Title":"Absolutely fabulous... No wait, this is Miss Congeniality!

I went in thinking that it would be a feminine chick flick which I would snore and snooze right the way through, but that was not the case..Sandra, presented as a 'tomboy' type slob at the beginning immediately appealed to me which made me think ok then... whats going on here? .. FBI agents, gun shots, terrorism??? OK, I don't think this is going to be a chick flick as many people are perceived by it's name.Sandra (Gracie) has to go undercover in the miss united states pageant to watch out for a terrorist attack after the FBI receives the 'bomb' threat. Watching Sandra change from a masculine tomboy, hard girl figure into a feminine, beautiful lady is really a liberating experience.. Although she is playing the part in the pageant, and she certainly looks the part, she is still the same 'Gracie Hart' inside. She stays beautiful on the inside whether she is wrapped in pearls and diamonds, and a flashy dress, or in her military boots, and knotted hair. Her beauty is deep...Sandra Bullock plays both a convincing Gracie Hart, and Gracie Lou Freebush in the film. By just watching the opening of the film you will be hooked with the talented acting skills and techniques within minutes.Michael Caine is certainly also a very funny character. He plays 'Victor' who is a beauty aide for Sandra, which is not usually his movie roles so thats worth seeing. He really pulled it off, without him it wouldn't be half as funny.. The expressions he can make! William Shatner's so called 'song' at the end is a laugh indeed, and his acting is so pure, and comedic...Every actor in the film is comedic, funny, and can be extremely dramatic at times, it's bizarre!

Sandra Bullock (who also co-produced) plays Gracie Hart, a homely FBI agent who goes undercover at the Miss United States beauty pageant to catch a terrorist who has threatened to blow up the pageant.  The story is funny and Bullock shows her range, proving to be an excellent comedian in addition to her proven talents as a dramatic actor.  The writers poke the typical fun at pageants and contestants throughout the film, but they develop a conscience at the end when Gracie gets teary-eyed admitting what a great experience it was.  There is plenty of silly slapstick humor.  Bullock does her runway thing with aplomb, and her tongue firmly in cheek.  Michael Caine is wonderfully droll as the beauty consultant who is given the impossible task of turning the ugly duckling into a swan.Interestingly, this is not the first film where Sandra Bullock makes the beast to beauty transition.  In one of her early films in 1991 (`Love Potion Number 9'), she plays a geek who discovers a love potion and turns into a knockout.  That film was an early indication of her comedic talents, but she eschewed zany comedy for dramatic and romantic roles for many years after that.  It is good to see her return to it.This is a very light and entertaining film that is easy to watch and easy to forget.  At over $100 million gross it had plenty of mass appeal.

They chose to shoot fish in a barrel by poking fun at beauty pageants, and even then, they couldn't even follow through on this, since the ultimate message is that beauty pageants aren't so bad after all.  Please do not encourage these film makers to film again with your $8.50.I took in this puff piece on Christmas Day because it happened to be the only thing showing at the moment we arrived at the theater.  The film opens with a flashback to the childhood of Gracie Hart, the title character, played by A.S., establishing the fact that even in grade school, she kicked ass and took names.  Why, we never really find out, or even begin to care. She is now an FBI agent, and her lack of social skills and basic grooming apparently also causes her to be a perennial screw-up on the job.  Facing an impending review board after her most recent fiasco, she by chance happens to be the perfect candidate to infiltrate the Miss United States Pageant in the hunt for The Citizen, a bogeyman who strangely never does amount to anything in the film.  I guess they couldn't get Alan Rickman.  In any event, he supposedly has sent a note vaguely threatening the pageant, so off we go.Despite raging protests by her boss, over-acted criminally by Ernie Hudson, Gracie is chosen by co-worker Eric Matthews (Benjamin Bratt) to turn in her t-shirt and sweats and submit to a makeover by pageant consultant Victor Melling, the foppish Michael Caine.  Predictably, Victor plays Henry Higgins to Gracie's Eliza Dolittle, and before you know it, Gracie's a stunner. This turns Eric's head, of course, and the romantic subplot is given life (barely).Meanwhile, Candice Bergen's pageant coordinator, Kathy Morningside, is cooperating with the FBI to allow Gracie in the pageant while simultaneously plotting to copy The Citizen's M.O. to sabotage it because she is being canned.  Again, we never are given any good reason why, nor do we care. William Shatner is introduced as the Bert Parks-like pageant host, but he mostly plays himself as, what else, an egotistic.......  Gracie flimsily enters the pageant to replace Miss New Jersey, who has been disgraced by starring in a porn video.  By this point, I wish I had rented that instead of going to the movies.The plot lurches forward, as Gracie works her way through the preliminaries, bonding with her competitors to dig up dirt.  Why the FBI thinks the contestants in a beauty pageant would be involved in bombing it is never made clear, nor does it really matter.  After some mildly amusing pratfalls and silly set pieces in lovely San Antonio, The Citizen is then caught off-screen, and Ernie Hudson barks shrilly for everyone to go home, or turn in their badge and gun!!! as if we didn't have enough cliches. Naturally, Gracie turns in her badge and gun, like every single cop in every single bad movie, and stays behind on her hunch that Kathy Morningside is up to something.  Eric soon follows, on cue.Of course, there is a happy ending, with Gracie reverting to her kick-ass form and punching out Miss California (which was pretty funny, I admit) as she and Eric save the pageant, learn something about themselves, and fall in love.  Maybe it would even make Ernie Hudson's heart melt!  Thankfully, we are spared that scene.A.S. attempts valiantly to carry the film, but even her considerable charms cannot overcome the hopelessly hokey plot.  And who would believe for even 10 seconds that Gracie isn't a babe?  This, among other myriad holes, sinks the movie from the start.  Bratt is a handsome man, but other than that, he's an empty suit.  Caine, fresh off his Oscar for Cider House Rules, looks foolishly out of place in this mess.  Bergen must be hurting for cash, and Shatner, well, is Shatner.  Four writers are credited and should all be ashamed.  A.S. is also listed as a producer.  Honey, when are you going to realize you keep making the same picture?

Thus we have all the comedy that comes with her literally battling everyone, including her own opinions on pageants, as she is being asked to be something she doesn't believe is in her make up. The mystery of who the killer is who's on the loose is strong for a good portion of film, and even once it's known and drama takes centre stage, it's still hard to get the smile off of your face. The jokes are plentiful, with Bullock finding chemistry with all of her co-stars. She's a very under valued comedy actress, and her ability to bond with an entire cast is marvellous to observe. Reference sexual tension with Benjamin Bratt, the jousting hostilities with Ernie Hudson, the way she bounces off of the other beautiful girls, and best of all the by-play with Michael Caine, who is playing a camp stylist and walks in to lift the laughter roof off the rafters in every scene he is in.It doesn't push the boundaries of comedy, but it's thankfully a consistently funny piece of work, aided by a super cast on form who make a better comedy out of what the screenplay suggested it had any right to be. 7/10 "},{"Title":"If you are a fan of Sandra Bullock then you are going to like this movie.","Date":"1 June 2015","Score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Comedy, Crime","Review":" Sandra Bullock plays Gracie Hart a tomboy FBI agent who goes undercover as a beauty contest in order to catch a criminal who is planing a bomb in the contest.

Okay, so despite a few attempts to move away from that image, 'loveable and kooky' is what she does best. And she does it very well here.In 'Miss Congeniality' she plays an FBI agent who has to go undercover in the Miss America beauty contest in order to protect its participants from someone threatening the event. I recently watched the X-files &#x96; another show centring on FBI agents. I couldn't help but laugh at the difference the 'Bureau' is portrayed in both shows. In the X-files they're all serious and professional, in 'Miss Congeniality' they kind of behave like frat boys at a college party.But then that's what Miss Congeniality is. It's not meant to be taken seriously, nor does it ever try. It's one of those perfect films that you can simply sit down and relax with. You won't need much brainpower to appreciate it. Sandra Bullock is as lovable and endearing as she always is and you won't care that the whole concept is kind of silly. How anyone fails to notice that Sandra Bullock isn't attractive, just because she wears glasses and doesn't brush her hair is beyond me!Although Bullock naturally carries the show as she's transformed from 'tom-boy FBI agent' to glamorous beauty queen (a process that can apparently be achieved overnight &#x96; but, again, never mind, eh?), it's worth noting that Michael Caine also has a role to play. He comes close to stealing every scene as the uptight Englishman the FBI have employed to mould her into 'Miss New Jersey.' There are no surprises plot-wise. You'll probably guess who the bad guys &#x96; really &#x96; are and there's the natural romantic sub-plot thrown in, just because. But, as long as you're only looking for pure entertainment, you probably won't care.This is a great movie to watch with other people. Sit back, crack open the popcorn, put your brain on hold and enjoy. Miss Congeniality is a classic in its own, laid back, easy-going league. No, it'll never be remembered in the same breath as the true cinematic greats, such as the Godfather etc, but then it's not meant to be. Just remember that while you're watching Sandra stumble into things and trip over on her heels.

Sandra Bullock (as Gracie Hart) really bring in a whole new meaning to a beauty pageant. Being an FBI agent, she has to go undercover as one of the finalists for the beauty pageant because the FBI had received intelligence about a plan to destroy the pageant. Who else but Gracie herself? At first when she was being chosen, it was really comical. At times I have to really laugh out loud. I mean, trying to move away from the stereotypes on how many of us often think beauty pageants are like...very refreshing. Gracie trying to learn to be a lady...almost unimaginable from her normal tomboyish self. But then she still managed to transform and when it happened, it even surprised her FBI colleagues.The other finalists had no idea about Gracie's true identity till the day after the crowning of the winner. The winner (Miss Rhode Island) credited Gracie for saving the beauty pageant despite whatever comes her way. Thus, winning the title of 'Miss Congeniality'.So, whoever says that girls don't know how to kick some butt? And doing it on a beauty pageant too? This movie will prove it all.

Her character Gracie Hart is an FBI agent who is lured into a beauty pageant by her partner and interim boss (played by the ever alluring Benjamin Bratt) to help foil the plot of a recent terror threat the Bureau received regarding the next Miss United States pageant (not to be confused with the Miss America pageant). And if you've seen the way Gracie Hart was just introduced to the audience in the scenes prior to the announcement that she will now be the new Miss New Jersey, then you know that whoever has the task of turning her into a beauty queen sure would be needing tons of therapy after-wards (and that is if they succeed). The scenes play out in such a funny manner that if you do not laugh as Gracie is being transformed into pageant material then, maybe something is wrong with your funny bone. Anyways, if you study the characters very well as they are introduced to the audience when Gracie finally completes her transformation, it won't be too hard for you to figure out where the terror threat came from. But if you're one of those people who can still enjoy films without over-analyzing it, then sit back, relax, enjoy and be shocked by the surprise twist and ending. There is one scene that did bother me though, when the queen was crowned and one of the runner-ups (who turned out to be a lesbian) had an outburst. It was not only tacky, it seemed forced and they should have left that on the cutting room floor. Nevertheless, Sandy and Benjamin have an on screen magic like you've never seen before. As they say about chemistry, you either got it, or you don't. -) "},{"Title":"An excellent entertaining film, that's really, really cute and funny, with a very good story, and a brilliant performance from Sandra Bullock!","Date":"18 March 2006","Score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Comedy, Crime","Review":" This is an excellent entertaining film, that's really, really cute and funny, with a very good story and a brilliant performance from Sandra Bullock!.

It's a rare old shoe of a movie that she can't spit polish into a diamond slipper, even if it is a temporary spell that wears off after midnight. Of course, there have been times when she couldn't sprinkle enough fairy dust to create even the illusion of charm, such as in the tragically awful Speed 2 Cruise Control and the awkward, best left undiscovered Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood.Fortunately, Miss Congeniality has just the right amount of real comedy at its heart, albeit encased in a cliche skeleton, for Bullock to bring out what's really good about it.FBI agent Gracie Hart is a coarse, hostile person entirely out of touch with her femininity. Her dinners are three-minute insta-meals which she cooks in a microwave, the door of which she wedges shut with a spatula because it won't close all the way. She spends her evenings working out frustrations on a punching bag, and gets into trouble with her boss for breaking rules on the job.But when duty calls, she reluctantly accepts the assignment to go undercover as a contestant (from New Jersey, of course) in the Miss USA pageant under the supervision of Benjamin Bratt, her fellow agent, and Michael Caine, the Professor Higgins of pageantry who will guide her through a Pygmalion-like transformation into a frothy beauty who just wants world peace. Of course, Gracie doesn't do all that very gracefully as she trips over heels, demeans baton-twirling to a baton-twirler, and alienates the pageant directors with her contempt for the scholarship program that is the Miss USA competition.Will Gracie catch the bad guys who are bent on terrorizing the pageant? Will she discover the beauty within? Will she and her handsome supervisor acknowledge the feelings they have for each other deep inside? Gee, whatever will happen?This is a formula movie, and the answers to those questions are knowable from the start. What counts is the journey to the obvious conclusion, and it's funny and well-executed. You won't find grand cinematography or profound statements about the illusory world of beauty pageants, but you will find engaging characters and some good laughs. Bullock did well in producing and starring in this cinematic taste treat. The gags are funny with some caveats to the cliche elements they know they're employing, and the supporting cast shines through. Caine delivers his usual, careful attention to his role, milking us for laughs as he tells Gracie to BE the crown... you are the crown... and William Shatner hams it up with self-effacing corn as the pageant host.But the truly overlooked gem of this film is Heather Burns, whose portrayal of the bubbly contestant from Rhode Island, who befriends Gracie unquestioningly, charms us to the last. You believe every second of her performance as she twirls batons, passes out from too many `tubie-thingy' drinks at a dance club and is desperate for some friendly girl-talk over fat-free hot chocolate. I hope to see much more from this almost unknown actress.I laugh with `Miss Congeniality,' and don't mind at all if Ms. Bullock takes my cash and laughs with it all the way to the bank.7 out of 10, with a wry grin.

Candice Bergen is great, Benjamin Bratt is believeable, and the computer dress up Sally scene is funny. Michael Caine is the Person Worth Watching, as always. I could have watched a lot more of him...and a lot less of Miss Rhode Island. I don't understand why she was made so obnoxiously dumb. Anyway, a movie worth seeing. Maybe twice.

That being said I did like this movie...it just never quite lived up to it's potential.A great deal of the humour in this film is the clumsy slapstick variety, and there is only so far you can play that before it gets dull. I spent most of the movie feeling sorry for the main character rather than laughing at her as I was supposed to. Also the ultimate villain of the film...well that twist makes absolutely no sense, if the villain was established to be nuts, well that would be different, and there are some tries at that. It is not however pulled off well enough to make the ultimate revelation any good...you are literally left sitting there agreeing with the head FBI agent in thinking 'what on earth would she do it for?'There was, however, one part of this movie that I absolutely loved the very first scene in the playground, which runs during the opening credits. This scene was truly hilarious, and heart-warming, however that effect simply did not last for the rest of the movie. I mean we never even find out Hart's motivation for joining the FBI (another short scene after the playground could easily have filled in that gap), and this lack of character development makes it more difficult to understand her actions later in the film.So overall, a decent film that doesn't live up to it's rep.

First, there's the argument with the gay gentleman played by the brilliant Michael Caine, in which she replies, You have no idea why I am the way I am. Well, it seemed fairly obvious to me. There seemed to be a chemistry between she and Rhode Island pageant woman. I didn't see much chemistry between the other FBI officer at all. Miss California jumps out of the finals yelling that if a lesbian can make it to the top ten in a pageant, we can do anything. Gracie cheers her on.She doesn't seem just Tomboyish. Gracie's character seemed more butch than anything. She hits like a man, she has table manners like one. She seems very masculine in this role, as was intended, but they seem to give you the idea throughout that there is more of a reason to that. They never give a reason when she claims, You have no idea why I am the way I am.. and it just seems off that they would never answer it when that's one of the bigger questions in the story.Now, I liked the film, I did. It was cute and funny, Bullock was great with her facial expressions. However, it just seems like they lead up to something that in the end, they rushed to make it over again.

I think you'll probably agree.Aside from feeling like the ending was disjointed and didn't work with the rest of the story (on the romantic level) the story is still adorable, Bill Shatner is still adorable, Bullock as always steals the show with her presence.

Sandra Bullock's Miss Congeniality is such a gem. I've watched it about three or so times now, and every time I find myself looking forward to the pleasure; and afterward, pleased with myself for doing so. Sandra's Gracie is a twist on Pygmalion, but doesn't suffer from the innate trap most such movies are subject to - in opening scenes giving the naturally pretty leading lady the appearance of a less than attractive blah character. Here, they get through the fact that Sandra Bullock/Gracie is truly beautiful early on in the movie, so we aren't left with the impression that somehow she improbably went from a sow's ear to a silk purse. The change is in her character, her personality. She begins the movie as an asocial loner slob, and through the movie discovers the satisfaction of good and close friends. Gracie is an FBI agent who goes undercover as a beauty contestant to investigate a serial killer's threats to the pageant. It's a comedy - a satire. The situations and story aren't to be taken too seriously, bordering on farce, but certainly not as broad or gross as the Airplane series. And as a send-up of beauty pageants it isn't as outrageous as Drop Dead, Gorgeous. Miss Congeniality doesn't lose itself in its farce; it always treats the girls with respect. Not only is Gracie a human of dimension, but all the main characters - Benjamin Bratt's and Michael Caine's characters, and the main ensemble cast of girls in the pageant - are made into people of substance. (SPOILER) One of the best sequences is the fun, girls' night out at a local drum/paint-splatter nightclub; it's a scene that does a great job of humanizing the contestants. The movie is sprinkled with touching scenes involving most of the main characters - poignant moments, which the movie doesn't linger on so long as to make them maudlin. The only ones in the cast whose characters are treated farcically are Candice Bergen and William Shatner; their performances are over-the-top ... deliberately, I guess, to keep the mood of the story light. In sum, what makes this movie good, I think, is that it's character driven. To me, character revelation/resolution is the main priority of any good story; and in this regard, Miss Congeniality delivers.

Victor had a lot of knowledge pertinent to the Pageants, as well as the inside politics of the Pageants, and applied every ounce of brilliance to transform Gracie to becoming a Total Woman and his own portrayal of a Support Team Member.

The FBI crime story element is both annoying and not needed.The first twenty-three minute segment, which sets up the crime story, is full of irritating stereotypes and plot clichés. The back-story and current job duties of Gracie Hart (Sandra Bullock), a tough-as-nails and decidedly uncultured FBI agent, I find not the least bit interesting. The FBI guys in general, and Chief McDonald (Ernie Hudson) in particular, are annoyingly generic police characters.But finally, after twenty-three minutes, the parody of beauty pageants begins. Michael Caine plays a classy beauty consultant who tries to transform the gauche Gracie Hart into a graceful queen, as she goes undercover. And some of the dialogue is funny, like when Caine's character disdains the way Gracie walks I haven't seen a walk like that since Jurassic Park. Later, in discussing talent competition, he laments I once had a girl who rearranged furniture.Candice Bergen makes a terrific pageant organizer. And William Shatner is surprisingly good as the smarmy pageant MC. The pageant itself is a hoot. When the MC asks Miss Rhode Island Describe your perfect date, she pauses, giggles, then responds That's a tough one. I'd have to say April 25th, because it's not too hot and not too cold; all you need is a light jacket. Funny stuff.The pageant climax is wonderfully uncivil, and very well choreographed, as the runners-up behave in ways that belie the expected graciousness of the contestants, while the MC tries to maintain normalcy as he sings an idealistic song, totally at odds with the chaos on stage.For her part, Sandra Bullock lays it on a little too thick with the clumsy, unrefined act. But the real distraction for me is the entire FBI intrusion. I would have preferred a simple spoof of pageants, sans boorish behavior.Yet, despite this, Miss Congeniality is still worth watching, for the humor, the casting, and especially the stinging satire of beauty pageants.

With the regaled Victor Melling (Caine) contracted to refine her rough edges and prepare her for contest, pageant director Candice Bergen recoils at the thought of such a tomboy compromising the exacting standards, poking fun at the almost sacrosanct beauty pageant industry.Apart from the precision professionalism of Caine and Bergen in their respective roles as perfectionists, Benjamin Bratt successfully breaks his Law and Order mould as Bullock's practical joking colleague, while ex-Ghostbuster Ernie Hudson plays the long suffering police chief.While the momentum sags a little early in the second half, William Shatner fills the void as the flamboyant and faithful right hand man to Bergen, showing his comedic talents first discovered on Star Trek had not waned over the intervening years. With a cast that seem to be comfortable in their roles and genuinely enjoying the witty dialogue, the laughs are solid and the general tone is enjoyable to watch.

While it is pretty much a basic, by-the-numbers comedy/rom-com, Bullock is a pleasure as always, and the fun spirit of the film elevates it beyond the standard script.Bullock plays Gracie Hart, a tomboy FBI agent with frumpy hair, baggy clothes and a fiery temper. All of her male agents view her as just one of the guys, and she clearly isn't feminine at all. When a domestic terrorist called The Citizen threatens the upcoming Miss United States pageant, fellow agent Eric Mathews (Benjamin Bratt) accidentally realizes that if she was fixed up, Hart could potentially look good enough to be shoehorned into the competition as a contestant in order to watch over the proceedings and help with the investigation. With the help of Victor Melling (Michael Caine), a tough yet funny pageant coach, Hart is transformed into Gracie Lou Freebush, the new contestant from New Jersey. She goes undercover to look for clues and help protect the other contestants.Some strong supporting roles are also played by Candice Bergen as the pageant director and William Shatner as the pageants longtime emcee. Heather Burns also brings some nice laughs as Miss Rhode Island, whom befriends Gracie, and is a total sweetheart, despite her ditzyness.The film, to be perfectly open and honest, is pretty darned generic. Nothing really exists in the film to set it apart from other comedies. It's a pretty bland script, and the concept, though cute, is derivative of other films and of conventions and clichés of comedy. But what makes this film work, and why I love it so much, is because of the great chemistry of the cast, and because of Bullock. She has always impressed me as an actress, and she is flawlessly able to pull off both the comedic and dramatic aspects of her roles. She is one of my favorite actresses, and I have a lot of respect for her as a person. Her giddiness and fun, quirky attitude is what makes this film work.The direction is halfway decent, though a few gags are phoned-in and fall flat. The editing, music and all of that is also very adequate. Like I said, this isn't a film you watch for the plot, this is a film you watch for Sandra Bullock and the rest of the cast.I'm giving this a strong 8 out of 10.

I liked most Cheryl (Heather Burns), who were funny because of her silliness.While other comedies have a hilarious first act and then afterward a weak third act, Miss Congeniality have most of the time comedy, but the plot also relies on many discussions between Gracie and her crew, which becomes distracting. The film opens with a action sequence and afterward you're expecting more action, but it's never shows up. The ending is also too sudden. And like most comedies it has to involve a stupid romance.Besides that, Miss Congeniality is a funny film and I still laughing when I'm seeing it.

Basically Gracie Hart (Golden Globe nominated Sandra Bullock) has a no-nonsense and hard hitting reputation and attitude, but when she fails to follow orders, the boss is not too confident she can work properly. But when the cops hear about a killer indicating a target at the Miss United States beauty pageant, they decide that someone needs to keep a close eye on the girls. They decide that Gracie should enter the contest as an ambitious participant, she is obviously not pleased that she has to act more lady like. But Victor Melling (Sir Michael Caine) is going to make sure that she does, oh, and the womanising agent Eric Matthews (Benjamin Bratt) has enough attraction for her to have some confidence. Also starring Candice Bergen as Kathy Morningside, Ernie Hudson as FBI Asst.

He is assigned to infiltrate a serial killer who threatens to target the Miss United States beauty pageant, and she has to become a participant in the contest to nail the attacker. The idea of Bullock, a feminist of sorts, becoming personally involved with her fellow contestants, an experience that dispels her preconceived idea that those kinds of women lack intelligence, is not entirely believable; but it lends an air of respectability.

I generally tune in, as it's just sheer mindless fun.Sandra Bullock is perfect in the role of Gracie Hart, a smart but bumbling FBI detective forced undercover as a beauty pageant contestant in order to unearth a serial murderer expected to strike there. At the pageant Bullock is assisted in her sleuthing by fellow agent, Eric, who is reluctantly attracted to her. She also encounters the questionable longtime Miss United States pageant hosts, played here by William Shatner and Candice Bergen. Of course our Miss New Jersey requires an enormous makeover, with Victor (Michael Caine) the witty handler who certainly has his work cut out for him, imparting beauty and sophisticated poise to this awkward tomboy.Can Victor transform Gracie, Pygmalion style, into a radiant beauty queen? (Caine is superb in his role here.) And lots of suspense...just who are the bad guys (or gals) in this scenario? Can anyone be trusted? The best part of the film, other than the endless laughs at Gracie's contempt for beauty pageantry and her utter clumsy unsuitability as a contestant (constantly on display), is the camaraderie that she develops with her fellow contestants, any one of whom could of course be a villain in gorgeous disguise, or indeed alternately, a victim. Suffice it to say, Gracie changes in more ways than one during the course of the pageant.Not rocket science, but the reason this movie shows up on TV so often is, I suspect, because like me, EVERYONE just loves it.

Beauty pageants are fertile ground for satire and slapstick, and the creators and actors don't let anything get by them. The cast is great, from Ernie Hudson as Gracie's boss, Michael Caine as her coach, Benjamin Bratt as her love interest, Candice Bergen as the pageant head honcho, William Shatner as the pompous pageant emcee, and the actresses who play the contestants. One nice touch is that they didn't make the contestants either bubbleheads or mean self-centered brats, which would have been the easy way out.

I love Benjamin Bratt in the role of the other F.B.I. agent. I love Sir Michael Caine as the flamboyant pageant consultant. It's nice to see Ernie Hudson working again. I love watching William Shatner as the pageant maestro and the multi-talented Candice Bergen as Miss Morningstar. Both Shatner and Bergen are pretty good at their roles in this film. Maybe that's why they work so well together in Boston Legal. This movie has it's moments. I didn't care for the scene which Miss New York comes out of the closet. I felt that was silly and useless. They could have edited it out. Then the guys asked Is it okay we say lesbian on television? Then the female (let me guess that's she a lesbian too) retorts Do you have a problem with that?

Bullock turned in sharp comic performance as Gracie Hart, an over anxious FBI agent who goes undercover as a beauty pageant contestant when it is learned someone is planning to kill whoever takes the crown. Director Donald Petrie guides Bullock with a sure hand and never allows her to go over the top with what could have been a purely slapstick female version of Ace Ventura...the comedy comes from a well-thought story with likable characters played by competent actors. Michael Caine shines as Victor Melling, the washed up contestant coach who is hired to make Sandra look like a real beauty pageant contestant (The eyebrows...there should be two!). Candice Bergen is beautifully bitchy as pageant director Cathy Morningside and Benjamin Bratt is a sexy and charismatic love interest for Bullock. And let's not forget William Shatner, warming up for his BOSTON LEGAL role here as the dim pageant host, Stan Fields.

The character development was strong with the women being shown as actually warm hearted individuals and not simply bubbly air heads.  The romance angle was cheesy and stilted, but where not actually dealing with an Oscar caliber movie here, but simply a light hearted comedy that was meant to delight the audience over the course of an hour and a half.

We chuckled and laughed from beginning to end. This is definitely a fabulous movie to help unwind and have a good time after a hard day at work.I was going to write my comments along those lines, but as I looked back upon the movie, I noticed a shadow underneath it. Intrigued, I studied it, and this veil of darkness grew as I looked closer. Though most reviewers are pouncing on the obvious ugly duckling transformation into beautiful swan plot, some shadowy wisps suggest a dark satire underneath the glare of the obvious.As I looked back from a distance, almost all of the characters were deranged, deviant, or bimbos. The only characters not in this class were Gracie (Sandra Bulluck) and the FBI chief. The latter was a bit part and not strongly highlighted. The rest of the FBI team appeared as bimbos with voyeuristic tendencies. Meanwhile, all of the pageant folks were bimbos, weirdos, or two-faced, and everyone seemed caught in obsessions. I suddenly realized, What a wretched portrayal of humanity! It was then I also realized that the rough-hewn, but gutsy and savvy character of Gracie was the only one whom most of the audience would empathize. Compared to the others, Gracie was already a swan at the start of the movie. Only outwardly was she ugly.As the movie progressed, not only did Gracie get sucked into the pageant physically, but there were hints that she might be getting sucked into the mind-set as well. Was Gracie becoming a bimbo? Also, near the movie's climax Gracie made a venomous threat toward the movie's villain which bordered on being maniacal. Was Gracie becoming deranged, too?? Was Gracie's character becoming corrupted and degraded like the other characters? Would she become ugly? Or would she finally extricate herself from this twisted mass of humanity and retain her gutsy and savvy persona?Is Miss Congeniality a light comedy, built of Pollyana fluff, describing an ugly duckling's transformation into a beautiful swan?Or is that just a façade for a dark comedy, with hints of A Clockwork Orange, describing a swan's degradation into an ugly duckling?Intriguing questions ...

Given the two romantic leads' actual ages (36 or so), Ms. Bullock and Mr. Bratt are young-looking but, in my opinion, not quite 29 and holding. We are encouraged to suspend disbelief as the pageant organizers fix the contest to allow Ms. Bullock's made-over character to reach the final stages of the 50(?)-state contest.  Mr. Bratt is entrusted with setting up the decoy operation as a rookie. I wondered how old is his character supposed to be?  However, he can generate few ideas of his own to catch the mysterious bomber/copy cat. As FBI agents, Bratt and Bullock are no match, though, for the early-retired Pageant handler/manager (Michael Caine) who knows more about falsies than does the FBI female agent.  Mr. Caine is much better with his comparable character in LITTLE VOICE who was given more creative tasks to do in that movie as a promoter for the female title character; in MISS CONGENIALITY, Caine seemingly steals scenes with one arm tied behind his back.  My verdict for this film now available on Video is B+ as a politically correct farce/decoy for a rather ineffective bomber.  The FBI supervisor who gets little respect (Ernie Hudson) comes across in more realistic manner than anyone else of the main roles (except the Bert Parks-clone played by William Shatner). The trio of Screenwriters could hardly have predicted that the FBI would look quite so ineffective as it has in the present year.  Mr. Hudson's character claims that he'll look the other way when his rogue pair of agents decide to go it as a duet, unaccompanied in the final act.  If only the real-life FBI could take its humble agents and improve them with some available make-up and pep talks while increasing their self-esteem, Robert Hanssen wouldn't have been operating as a Russian double-agent for so long.

Bullock's FBI agent represents what a lot of women would like to be if they dared free themselves from conventional behavior, and her eventual appreciation of the other contestants' value appeals to women who are put off by strident feminism's criticism of the more traditional point of view.  Men, however, may appreciate less seeing some of their typical behavior towards women (such as the male agents' reactions to having the hidden camera in the contestants' dressing room.)  But I'm getting too heavy here.  The film is enjoyable on the surface, and well worth the time. "},{"Title":"Great movie!

This is Bullock's first film in a long time that actually isn't a chick flick (I'm a 15 year old guy who can't stand chick flicks, but I loved this movie), and it's a lot of fun, as long as you don't take it seriously.It starts off slowly and your interest will inevitably waver a bit at the beginning, but the laughs start piling on top of each other fast and furiously soon. Bratt is just plain annoying (a brat, if you will), but the rest of the cast is great. Besides Bullock, there's Candice Bergen is a great villainous turn and William Shatner as a seasoned beauty pageant host, among a slew of others. Sure the films' contrived and unoriginal, but it's a lot of fun, and you can't resist it. So stop poking holes in the wafer thin plot or saying the characters are thin and undeveloped and just realize that it wasn't meant to be taken seriously, it's a lightweight comedy and should be treated as such.

Well this is a new decade, and Ms. Bullock is now hoping to restore her reputation with her latest film Miss Congeniality.She stars as Gracie Hart, an FBI agent assigned to go undercover at a beauty pageant to uncover a suspected bomb plot. To coach her along the way, the Feds enlist the help of pageant veteran Victor Melling (Caine) who is given the role of transforming ice-cream and doughnut scoffing Gracie into a genuine Miss America competitor.Caine excels in his role and undoubtedly has the best lines in the film`I was disturbed by that half-masticated cow rolling around in your mouth' he croons at Gracie over dinner, before following it up with the equally touching `I haven't seen a walk like that since Jurassic Park'.The first 45 minutes are witty and entertaining as Caine takes tomboy Gracie and changes her into an authentic beauty queen. Bullock's performance is also noteworthy and goes at least someway to repaying the debt she owes for so many poor films.That is until the pageant itself. The side-swipes at middle-America's ridiculous pageantry is suddenly shunned as Bullock's character turns full circle before the whole film degenerates into farce. The ending is poor, predictable, unmoving and definitely NOT funny. There's a clever cameo from William Shatner but not even that can restore the film's dignity.Ultimately though if you want a good date movie, it's easy on the eyes, requires little thought and hey, anything's better than Speed 2.7/10 "},{"Title":"Big fun!","Date":"27 March 2001","Score":"","Genre":"Action, Comedy, Crime","Review":"  I saw this one last weekend and although I'm not a fan of the genre at all I really enjoyed Miss Congeniality.First I thought I was going to see some bad movie (I didn't like the first scene at all and it should've been dropped on the floor of the editing room).

She can be regarded as the female equivalent of Jim Carrey, in that they both tend to be physical comedians, ie. relying more on facial expression, actions, and mannerisms, rather than wisecracks or sit-coms.  This film is of the My Fair Lady variety, with tomboy Sandra as Gracie being transformed into a beauty pageant contestant. While so many women nowadays want to be like men, here's one who ends up going the opposite way - by force of circumstance.  She discovers her feminine side.  The beauty pageant participants are not ridiculed, but are shown to have brains as well as beauty.  Gracie comes to realise that her girlfriends in the pageant aren't bimbos. The whole movie is an FBI thriller, and quite coherent, but comedic also. Sandra Bullock is central to it, of course, and I regard this as one of her best movies.  This seems to be reflected at the box office.

Written by Marc Lawrence, Katie Ford and Caryn Lucas. Starring Sandra Bullock, Michael Caine, Benjamin Bratt, William Shatner, and Candice Bergen. Running Time 110 minutesOverviewWhen the FBI gets a tip that a terrorist is targeting the Miss USA pageant, the agency decides to arrange for an undercover operative to pose as one of the contestants. The bureau's exhaustive computer search yields only one possibility Gracie Hart (Bullock), an unkempt, tomboyish agent who pounds a punching bag and roughhouses with her G-man pal (Bratt). The pageant's promoters (Bergen and Shatner) are in on the operation, but dread the task of turning Bullock into a credible contestant. For that they hire has-been beauty consultant Victor Melling (Caine) to get the reluctant beauty ready for the runway. As the pageant progresses and the various competitions are completed, Bullock and her fellow crime fighters unravel the mystery and unmask the miscreants.Review (2 stars out of 4)Like the tasty cakes in the catchy jingle, nobody doesn't like Sandra Bullock. With her killer smile, girl-next-door charm and captivating manner, she's one of our most beloved film femmes. Her movies, however, are another story. In this one, for example, the filmmakers focus on Bullock, but fail to provide a convincing story and structure. Unexplained investigative lapses and contrived plot devices serve no other purpose than to maximize Bullock's screen time. People in the theater will solve the case long before the characters on the screen do. And when the plot falls from the heavens, sometimes the star falls with it.But not this time. Bullock remains well established in the box-office firmament and her comic talents and screen presence are so strong that one wishes they could be featured in more challenging projects. Nevertheless, she successfully pulls off all aspects of her character, from awkward agent to eye-catching beauty queen (and she even picks up a producer credit along the way).Though the film pokes fun at the pageants, it also lets us have it both ways We can be smugly amused at the absurdity of the beauty business while at the same time be feasting our eyes on Bullock and other leggy beauties.As for supporting performances, Bratt creates a too-serious character, not unlike his TV cop in Law and Order. Shatner is excellent as the cheerfully clueless emcee, mixing equal parts of Bert Parks and his own persona. As the pageant's boss, Bergen delivers a humorless version of Murphy Brown, with all of the sarcasm but none of the sass. Caine is perfect as a gay makeover artist with a questionable past.The attractive shooting locations in and around San Antonio and the glitzy but accurate art direction make for an eye-appealing production that deserves to be in support of a better movie. Miss Congeniality looks good and so does Bullock. This outing won't hurt her career, but if she ever wants to catch the Julia, she'll need to find better material upon which to affix her signature smile.###  "},{"Title":"EXCELLENT!

I know,sounds goofy, doesn't it? One of America's Sweethearts playing an uglier-than-thou role. Trust me, though; Miss Bullock does pull it off. Bullock's Gracie Hart is mousy and sloppy. She chews with her mouth open, spits, burps, and is generally the very picture of uncouth behavior.One of her colleagues, Eric Matthews (Benjamin Bratt) finally gets the opportunity to run his own operation - stop the series of mad-bombers. He's not especially bright; he's more of a pretty boy who's more interested in playing with the ladies than in working on a case, although he loves the glory attached to success. The FBI learns that the next probable target for this bomber is the Miss United States Pageant to be held in San Antonio, Texas, right next door to the Alamo. After much fruitless deliberation, Eric finally decides an officer must go undercover at the pageant and, of course, he settles on Gracie, who looks (in these scenes) about as sexy as a muddy street. Ah, but Gracie must undergo a bit of a transformation! Enter disgraced pageant mentor Victor Melling (Michael Caine). Victor's task transform Gracie into a princess. In scenes reminiscent of My Fair Lady (Gracie even calls him Henry Higgins at one point), Victor shows Gracie how to walk, how to talk, and how to eat like a lady. Mission accomplished! Except for the talent... But Gracie does manage to find a way!What's most surprising about this movie is Bullock's success in playing a down-and-dirty role. As Gracie, she's not supposed to be a cute girl playing a slob; she's a slob playing a cutie. And since Bullock is pretty darn cute herself, she's a cutie playing a slob playing a cutie. That ain't easy, folks. (Not that I know firsthand, mind you.) And her prowess at playing physical comedy is also quite formidable. Case in point In an early scene, Gracie comes home from work very frustrated. She slams doors, knocks into things accidentally, opens the freezer and takes out a frozen dinner, and tosses it into the microwave. Then slams its door shut and starts away. Only it doesn't close. So she comes back and slams it again. Still won't close. She's getting more and more frustrated - and I'm sure you can all relate to this - and the process repeats a few times. Finally, she wedges a cooking spoon in the door jamb to make it stay shut. I was rolling at that point, and I was not alone in my mirth!Bullock's supporting crew is fine, although I think Bratt was a bit of a pain (character-wise, and no pun intended). Bullock's FBI boss (Ernie Hudson) was fair, but inconsequential. The coolest characters were played by Candace Bergen (as the pageant director) and William Shatner (as the pageant's host, a la Bert Parks). Both were wildly over the top. And yes, Shatner sings.This was a surprisingly good film. Watch it!

I wouldn't call it best of 2000 (X-Men is), but it is a good comedy. I will definitely be purchasing this once it hits video. And coming into the theater I was skeptical. I wasn't staying away with a cross and holy water but the only thing I remember thinking when I saw the trailer was Hey, there's Benjamin Bratt from Law and Order and If it's a Sandra Bullock film I suppose it's OK. My friend took me and I loved it so much I brought friends to a second time. It's not one of the best movies I've ever seen, maybe in the top 25. But the movie is memorable simply because it's funny.Michael Caine is great in this movie. I especially enjoyed the way that he and Benjamin Bratt interacted especially when it became obvious what Vic's preferences were. Watching the horror on Ben Bratt's face and then watching him flee the scene was one of my favorite moments. I enjoyed Bratt as Eric Matthews here. He had never done anything much for me on Law and Order - no one out-Noths Chris Noth after all - but here he makes a surprisingly good action hero (like Rob Lowe in Atomic Train, the WORST movie ever). He has a good sense of humor. I loved watching him play off Sandra Bullock. And strangely I thought he was cute in this movie although I have never thought so before.That was not the only change. Sandra Bullock shot up my list of favorite actresses with this movie from about average to in my Top 10. She is a good comedienne here. I gained respect for Michael Caine as a comedic actor. It was great to see Candice Bergen outside of Murphy Brown. And William Shatner, who irritates me to death with his Priceline commercials, Captain Kirk acting and even his voice, actually made me laugh here. The music was good, especially One in a Million by Bosson which is one of my favorite movie songs. This movie was full of pleasant surprises.The strangest thing was I took a bunch of loud, rowdy people and a guy friend of mine - and my friends actually managed to shut up except when they were laughing so hard. And my macho-guy friend actually enjoyed the flick and is coming back with me this weekend to see it again. That's how pleasant a present (excuse the rhyme) Miss Congeniality is. Definitely worth a look for a good comedy. 3.75 stars out of 4, losing .25 for some predictable subplots.

I've never been a big fan of Sandra Bullock (after Hope Floats, who could?), but her comedic talents in this one were recognized. She looked gorgeous in the pageant, and of course, for all you ladies out there, Ben Bratt's chest had a decent amount of screen time, so don't think Bullock is the only eye candy in this one. But the best thing about the movie was Michael Caine, who was absolutely hilarious as the beauty consultant. His gay character was a bit over-the-top, but his eloquent lines and expressions were classic. The line about the deaf mute had me rolling in the sticky aisles. Keep your ears open for that one, as well as the half-masticated cow line. William Shatner was unfortunately underutilized, but he still made the most of his lines. As for Candace Bergen, I really never liked her in Murphy Brown, so I don't have much to comment. Overall, for all you guys out there, don't expect much, but expect to at least be entertained. It's not as bad as you think, and as long as you're not looking for any Oscar nominations, you'll be fine. Do something for your wife and take her to see this one.

The story revolves entirely around Sandra and all of the other characters have been made to look incredibly stupid and/or weak. Sandra is supposed to be an ugly duckling-like female who gets transformed into a beauty contest participant but she is obviously very attractive from the start (kind of like Rachel Leigh Cook in She's All That)There was a bit too much punching in the movie for me and the male characters were pretty embarrassing, especially Benjamin Bratt. There's even a scene where Sandra seriously kicks his butt, mostly for her own amusement. Has he no pride?

Miss Congeniality is in my opinion the best comedy motion picture of 2000. This I totally did not expect. Sandra Bullock pulls out all the stops in this film, her best film role in quite a while. She plays Gracie Hart, a tough but clumsy FBI agent who goes undercover as a beauty queen at a Miss U.S.A. pageant that's being threatened with a bombing. Hart's job is to find out whose responsible and to stop the person from blowing up the event. During this time the Bullock character has to go through a transformation from an average-looking woman to a dashing beauty thanks in part to the beauty pageant image consultant (Michael Caine) on orders from the president of the event (Candice Bergen). Bullock is hilarious in this movie. She's very good at playing macho one minute and bumbling the next. She's perfect here. Caine has some terrific moments as the image consultant, and it's great to see Bergen back on the big screen after a 15 year hiatus (her last theatrical film was the 1985 Burt Reynolds directed bomb Stick; everybody knows what she did during 10 of those years FYI a.k.a. Murphy Brown). Benjamin Bratt (as Bullock's FBI partner) proves to be a good sidekick for Bullock, and William Shatner (Adm./Capt. Kirk of Star Trek) is very funny as the pageant's host. Miss Congeniality has plenty of funny moments throughout but the reason why this is the best comedy of 2000 is that it's so much fun.

Though she doesn't have much of a speaking voice (I do wish she'd work on her shrill tones), she throws herself into her roles, doing admirable work even when the script is so-so. Even her voice is perfect in Miss Congeniality, where, as a dorky FBI agent impersonating a beauty contestant from New Joisey, she nails nerdiness to a T. Her snorty laugh alone is enough to elicit snorty laughs of your own.

No meaning here, just a light entertainment that will give you a well-deserved therapeutic break from your stressful job, the American electoral process, or whatever.

I hoped that it would, but when I go to see a commercial film I am always prepared for the worst.  Lately, it seems it is almost impossible to see a movie where the women are just people - unexploited and not purely there to be sexy.Certainly Miss Congeniality recognized women as being sexual creatures, but it was not predominated by the female stereotype so prevalent in America today.  Bullock's character was allowed to be strong and not the weak, slutty Hollywood female star we usually end up suffering through (for reference, see Dracula 2000, The Replacements, or pretty much any action film out there).  I was glad that she didn't seduce men or flaunt herself. She was allowed to be a woman without being made into a prostitute.I knew that there would be a transformation in the movie, and I was worried that when Bullock went from tough cop to contestant she would become a stupid, sniveling woman as well.   I was very relieved when she remained tough but was allowed to accept herself as a woman rather than run from her gender.  Much of her bitterness and social commentary was so dead-on.  It was almost exactly how I feel about society.  Perfect!  I think there should be more movies like this, and less like The Replacements.My only qualm with the film is that Bullock's character was referred to as a feminist.  I am so tired of this.  Just because people realize that women are not treated equally and attempt to change it or choose not to conform to the media's ideal of a woman does not make them feminist.  It simply makes them humanist and intelligent.I'd like to praise this movie, cast, crew, and all involved for a job well done!

Her partner (Benjamin Bratt - Julia Roberts honey) could have used a few better lines - But his charm adds a lot to the relationship of these two characters.I gave the movie 7 stars - which is good, I mean we're not talking Oscar material here.  My favorite scene is when she hates the thought of appearing in a swimsuit on stage and is wrapped tightly in a towel and is then promptly pushed on stage by Michael Caine and the towel is torn off and the goofy FBI agent stumbles forward.

But all that turns out mostly to be a foil. The movie works best when it is just being funny, which it frequently is, and hilariously so. The police procedural plot isn't much to write home about, and isn't intended to be. It's mostly a romantic comedy, with the romance deliberately understated. Hmmmm. Well, it is a pretty odd romantic comedy, too, considering how little romance there is. Police procedural...nyet. Romantic comedy...odd. Yet...it mostly works. This is because of an affecting and skilled comedic performance from Sandra Bullock and a lot of little comedic skits that work just about perfectly. It makes your mind turn off to the other flaws, which are foils for a comedic character study that Bullock pulls off beautifully, even though she is getting to be a little long in tooth for the role of beauty contestant and looks like she liked that pizza a bit too much here and there...! ;)On the whole, frothy and insubstantial, but so much fun, if somewhat corny, that it is hard not to like.

This movie is great, one of the best I've seen all year. It is worth the admission fee and leaves you with a good feeling.Most of the jokes are all new, and give us a new view at America's fetish with Scholarship Funds aka Beauty Pageants.  With Drop Dead Gorgeous we saw the inside politics and the corruption of Beauty Pageants.  In Beautiful we saw how it affected the actual person. With Miss Congeniality we see how they are not exactly feministic, but instead are more like a sister-hood of beauty queens.Bullock goes through a fascinating transformation, from hard-core F.B.I. agent-slob to a prim and proper Miss NewJersey. The story is really focused on her and the people around her, which might not sound interesting but it works in the end.  The jokes are hilarious, one of the movie's faults is that the jokes are all so close together that sometimes you won't be able to hear what the actors are saying. Bullock's acting is superb and her character is totally believeable. Michael Caine gives another good performance, proving again that you can only get better as life goes on. Benjamin Bratt seems comfortable in his  usual good cop role. Candice Bergen and William Shatner give us something new to entertain us too.The movie also has an awesome soundtrack that fits the moods perfectly. The actors all do an excellent job, and the movie just works. You will leave the theater feeling good about yourself, even though it's not exactly a feel good movie. One of the best qualities this movie has is that it makes an excellent role model for young girls. It shows how beauty pageants are really a thing for the public to devour and not the critique of being a successful woman in today's soceity.I give this movie 2 thumbs up!

After a clever childhood retrospective, it seems tired and languishes with FBI humor we've all seen before.  My wife - who kicked my shin as I motioned for the door - insisted we stay and she was right.  It blossomed quickly thereafter into a terrific comedy with sidesplitting moments well worth the admission price.Though Sandra Bullock holds a powerful box office drawer ever since Speed, she never cast her spell on me.  I've seen everything she's done, but always thought her best work was Speed.  Hope Floats 2nd.  28 Days, 3rd.   Miss Congeniality now seizes the top slot.   Let it be written; let it be done. This is her `coming out' film (for me, at least) to justify her star power. Production control perhaps was the missing ingredient and her secret weapon.A San Antonio Miss USA Beauty Pageant serves as center stage.  An overwrought theme in the eyes of many, it still plays well here.  The villains are true to character from the start - but I'll bet you can't name both of them early on.  The mischievous unveiling adds to the fun.FBI agent Gracie Hart (Sandra) becomes ringmaster to a three-ring circus in this frolic.  Tasked to disarm a terrorist threat, the tomboy agent enters the beauty pageant kicking and screaming from the first bikini wax to the crowning of the winner.  Subtle humor, pranks, witty dialog and goofy antics pasted a grin on my face from the 21st minute onward.  Sandra is surrounded by top-notch star power ranging from Michael Caine and Candice Bergen to William Shatner and Ernie Hudson.  Yet no one upstages another.  They work as an ensemble to delight the audience - and thus produce those hysterical moments.  Chemistry.  Timing.  There's no substitute for it if good comedy is the goal.A dozen memorable lines from other films are reworked and peppered throughout to charm this spoof.  After the first few, I thought `O god . . . tired script  . . .unimaginative writing'.  And then it hit me!   This is irreverence on parade.  Cliché lines can sparkle when they're properly delivered.  Leslie Neilson's personality was the only missing ingredient - who would've been a great addition by the way (note to S Bullock for the sequel, for which there will be an outcry).When I consider a film `Bullocked' henceforth, it'll not be in a negative sense.  Instead Bullocked (bool´ek'd) positive verb transitive. 1. Enchanted by a  rising star; 2. Well entertained.  As if `worth the ticket price.'My IMDB vote 7 out of 10.  See it the next time you're taking life a little too seriously.  Now if I can only get my wife to stop her `I told you so's, life will be perfect all around.  We chuckled all the way to the car.

Five years ago, that might have been a workable idea; Bullock was young, perky and cute then, with real potential.  But she failed to ever show any actual acting talent, and now she's just another name on the huge cut-throat A minus list, starving herself ever thinner in a desparate attempt to land half decent roles.And this might have been a half decent role if Bullock was either a decent actress, or even a decent piece of flesh.  But she was never the former, and is no longer the latter.  I'm so tired of watching actors who happen to have the right face or body struggling with parts that are way beyond their meagre talents.  Bullock is embarrasingly unconvincing in her tough grrl persona, and is equally improbable as a beauty pageant bimbo, being way too old and frankly tired looking.Sandra is tolerable enough in a supporting role, but she should really step aside and give some actual actresses a chance to do more with leading roles than just pose and grimace.

A couple notes on films on airplanes in general 1) My tolerance for general badness in films increases on airplanes because it's better to be poorly entertained/distracted than to deal with the utter boredom of being in a flying tin can.2) The viewing conditions are less than spectacular. In my case, everything on the screen was way too red and way too green. Someone doesn't know how to properly adjust the B747 projectors. And you have to listen on weak airline headphones. Well, at least I brought my own Sennheisers to improve the sound a little.Okay, onto the review. I get the feeling that if I had watched this film somewhere other than the plane, I would've disliked it. That said, I didn't exactly like this film. It lies somewhere in between entertaining and making me wish that they played a different movie. Occasionally, the jokes worked and the charm was up. Most of the time, it seemed like a bunch of annoying characters bouncing around on-screen.The story isn't realistic, but that's not really a complaint. The whole thing is ridiculous from the start so it's completely understandable that the film would be generally ridiculous. It doesn't try to pass itself off as a film of any depth either, so there's no real worry there. The problem really lies in that the film isn't funny. The humor of the film squarely lies in the realm of teen comedy, which never really amused me (most of the time). Watch Sandra do water glass tricks. Watch Sandra beat up nameless co-star. Oh look, a small role by... William Shatner? Watch Sandra get turned from boring tough-tomgirl fbi-agent to boring tough-beauty pageant contestant? Honestly, if she were more believable as a tough fbi-agent, maybe it'd work, but her character needs to be both super-tough and super-nerd. Right.I can't say that the acting, directing, story, score, editing, set/costume design, lighting, special effects, plotting or anything else in the film is really standout. In fact, it all just globs together into the murky mess of mediocre 90's comedies. On the plus side, it wasn't particularly painful to watch and is a whole lot more interesting than staring at a headrest for an hour and a half.So there you go. It's a typical mediocre comedy. If you have to choose between watching this and staring blankly at a headrest for an hour and a half, I'd say watch this. If you have to choose between watching this a second time and staring blankly at a headrest for an hour and a half, that's a toughie. I'd go for the headrest. 5/10.

Even when the script doesn't quite work, she never fails to exude an air of strength and charm. The premise-a female FBI agent infiltrating a beauty pageant-is undeniably silly, but she makes it convincing.Michael Caine is terrific as the contest consultant, and William Shatner is a hoot as the clueless host. However, Benjaman Bratt is stiff (though he tries) as Bullock's colleague. There's a hint of romance, but this is wisely kept to a minimum, as little or no chemistry is generated.I've mentioned that the script doesn't always work. To be more specific, it just needed more laughs. The first act is the best, simply due to the abundance of humor.

It is clear from the box cover/poster that this fits into both the 'fish-out-of-water' and 'makeover movie' formulas. Sandra Bullock is Gracie Hart, an impossibly shlumpy young FBI agent who has, her entire life, suffered from the Ugly Duckling syndrome. A letter from the 'the Citizen', a mass-murderer, leads the Feds to believe his next target will be the Miss United States pageant. And of course they'll need an agent to go undercover. And of course it will be Gracie. They reckon she's the only one who'll look half-decent in a bathing suit, so despite her recent screw-up during an arrest, they send her to a pageant consultant (Michael Caine). The typical transformation into Swan commences, and there is, of course, a cute guy (Benjamin Bratt) who never really noticed her before but suddenly realizes she looks pretty nice in a miniskirt. Burdened with a weak script with little to recommend it but plenty of straggling plot points, the movie is still not without a few positive qualities. The performances are good enough, the jokes are cute enough, Sandy Bullock is beautiful and a good physical comedienne. There's nothing wrong with any of that. The problem is that this same movie has been made about 3 dozen times under different titles in the past couple of years alone. And it's been made better. If you are a Sandy fan, happen to love makeover movies or are in the mood for one while in the video store, by all means give 'Miss Congeniality' a try.

MISS CONGENIALITY though is quite a relief compared to some of her worst. The star attraction actually cannot hold up to her co stars, namely Michael Caine who was an exceptional breath of fresh air in this heap of waste and all others being produced these days. It was also nice to see Ernie Hudson in a movie where he can be noticed (I have yet to see THE WATCHER). Having a good supporting cast does not quite cut it for MISS CONGENIALITY. Having more than one movie satire about beauty pageants in one year alone is too much (see BEAUTIFUL with Minnie Driver). Nevertheless, an OK, yet predictable movie such as MISS deserves some sort of review.The FBI are working to stop a bombing set to go off at the Miss United States beauty pageant. They need to find the perfect undercover agent. They find the perfect one . . . only to find out she is on maternity leave. The second candidate is Gracie (Bullock), who definitely needs some brushing up on to prepare for the pageant. The man to do this crazy job is Victor (Caine), an expert in preparing ladies for the main event. Altogether, Victor and the FBI set out to find the bomber before it is too late.Simple plot (thankfully) and acting, save MISS from being a total turkey. It does not try and be anything it is not until they add a romantic interest between Gracie and her partner Eric. Even then, they keep that to a minimum. Until the end though, something about the movie totally stinks. Maybe it is the fact that you can call each and every thing that is going to happen. Maybe it is Miss Rhode Island 's annoying voice.

A mysterious terrorist sends cryptic messages which only make sense after the crime is perpetrated. The FBI are at a total loss. However, agent Bullock figures out the next one will be at the Miss United States beauty pageant in San Antonio. So, when they find out that Miss NJ has made a porno film, they basically threaten to expose her if she doesn't pull out voluntarily so that Bullock, the life-long homely-looking  tomboy and rough FBI agent, can replace her and work from the inside to thwart the terrorist before anything happens.The biggest challenge is making Bullock look and act like a beauty queen, and Michael Caine is the expert hired to transform her. During the pageant the real terrorist is caught elsewhere so the FBI team, led by Benjamin Bratt of Julia Roberts' beau fame, packs up to head home. But Bullock still suspects that the pageant head, Candace Bergen, plans to do something bad, so sticks around anyway. Turns out Bergen is out for revenge for being fired after this pageant, and her son rigs up an exploding crown to blow up the new Miss US.The last few scenes deal with the pageant finale and the catching of the crooks, where Bullock is required to use her fighting skills. William Shatner does a good job as the emcee. In the end, Bullock and Bratt appear to be headed for romance!  Big surprize, 'wink-wink'!!There is absolutely nothing about this film that is believable, and it spoofs beauty pageants very lustily. Still, none of that matters because it is not intended to be high art, just good entertainment for Sandra Bullock fans.  We enjoyed it, and I give it a 7 of 10 rating for entertainment value.

How original! We just got to watch the SAME scene a couple of months ago in Hannibal. So we know what will happen she makes a mistake, she gets beaten for it, and (but of course) she gets a new assignment so that she can clear her name.Stop me if I am wrong here, but this is one of the longest chain of clichés in any movie. Big momma's house, Hannibal, Pygmalion, My Fair Lady, you name it, it's here.It shows who the Producer was. She never stops hogging the screen, either eating tons of ice cream (who thought that was funny), or smiling, or insulting anyone. Someone should tell Ms. Bullock that it takes a special someone to be funny and gross at the same time (think Eddie Murphy), and she is definitely not that kind of person. Her jokes are boring, her acting is only so-so, and she never stops being the nice one, the intelligent one, the good one. What a bore. Furthermore, the film lacks coherence and credibility. We are supposed to be watching a serious comedy, yet when she is having her make-up applied, a megaphone blurts out make up, podiatrist, dermatologist, aisle 25, urgent, as if in a real hangar. So dumb. I agree, there are times we should check our brains at the door and just forget all about coherence, but that is usually in stupid comedies, as Dumb and dumber.

When the possible threat of violence at the `Miss United States' beauty pageant surfaces, the F.B.I. meets the challenge by sending in one of their own agents, Gracie Hart (Bullock), undercover as one of the contestants.  There's one slight problem, however; Gracie is the right agent for the job, but she'd be more comfortable wearing a championship WWF belt than striking a pose in a swimsuit.  Not to worry, though, because pageant organizer Kathy Morningside (Candice Bergen) has just the man to transform her into the beauty she must be, and he has all of two days in which to do it.  The man of the hour (and the Professor Higgins to Gracie's Eliza) is none other than Victor Melling (Michael Caine), who has made a career out of grooming young ladies for the formidable task of competing in the arena of the Most Beautiful.  But with Gracie, he has his work cut out for him.  She's good with her dukes, has a penchant for pizza and beer, has a walk more like John Wayne than a future Miss U.S. and snorts when she laughs.  All of which adds up to a good time for the audience, if not for Victor, as he goes to work. 	The story, while not altoghether original, is entertaining fare that is handled well by director Petrie and is, most importantly, what a comedy should be  Funny.  For a comedy to work, a number of elements have to come together and gel; in this case, it's a combination of a concept that is credible, dialogue that is clever and gets laughs without being forced, some good physical bits (including a sparse use of slapstick that is effective), and a pace that keeps it all fresh as the story unfolds.  What really puts this one over, however, are the stars, Bullock and Caine. 	The winsome Bullock demonstrates her versatility by pulling out all the stops physically, while creating a character that is totally believable, abandoning the safety net of the glamorous, girl-next-door, America's sweetheart type to make Gracie a very real, earthy person.  And with all that goes on, it would be easy to ignore the emotional development she brings to the character as well, but it is there; by the end of the film we see a different Gracie, one of changed attitude and broadened horizons.  And it works because Bullock makes it sincere and genuine, which makes Gracie an endearing, memorable character.  The same can be said of Michael Caine's performance as the effeminate Victor.  With his usual charm, he plunges into Melling's skin and paints him with fine strokes of nuance and wit, while managing to avoid stereotype as he creates a character that is uniquely his own.  And the fact that Caine and Bullock play so well off of one another takes the movie to a higher level on that regard alone. 	Notable in supporting roles are the likable Benjamin Bratt , as Agent Eric Matthews, who watches Gracie's transformation with great interest; William Shatner, doing a camp turn as Stan, the `Bert Parks' of the Miss U.S. Pageant; Heather Burns, as Cheryl, `Miss Rhode Island;' and Bergen, who gives a winning performance as Morningside, the former beauty queen.  Rounding out the cast are Ernie Hudson (McDonald), Wendy Raquel Robinson (Miss California), Diedre Quinn (Miss Texas) and Melissa De Sousa (Miss New York).  A funny, feel-good movie, `Miss Congeniality' is a satisfying comedy that will make you laugh and leave you with a smile on your face, with performances by Bullock and Caine that are worth the price of admission alone.  For a solid evenings entertainment, check this one out; you'll be glad you did.  I rate this one 8/10.

Miss Congeniality is one of them. The story comes from the masterminds behind such hits as Forces of Nature and TV's Family Ties Vacation and Search for a Supermodel (Marc Lawrence for the first two, Katie Ford for the latter).  It is directed by the one and only Donald Petrie, responsible for the 1999 stinker, My Favourite Martian (to his credit, he has directed a number of hits, including Grumpy Old Men). It features the look-at-me-I-am-so-cute antics of Sandra Bullock (also the producer) and the I'll-do-anything-for-a-paycheck skills of Benjamin Bratt. So what's not to like?Bullock plays FBI agent Gracie Hart.  She is a rough, crude, unrefined woman who could beat the snot out of any man if he looked at her funny.  She always seems to be screwing things up, finally getting herself in trouble when she nearly gets an agent killed during an operation.  Despite the heat from her supervisor (played by Ernie Hudson), she is elected as part of a special team headed by Eric Matthews (Bratt) to capture an elusive criminal known as The Citizen.  Apparently, this deranged killer is going to strike again.  This time, the Miss United States Pageant is the target.The only catch to Gracie being selected as part of the team is that she has to be in the pageant, as a contestant.  After receiving clearance from the people running the pageant (played by Candice Bergen and William Shatner), the newly appointed Miss New Jersey has two days to be whipped in to pageantry shape.  To pull off this nearly impossible feat, Bergen brings in a former expert to assist Gracie.  Academy Award-winner Michael Caine (The Cider House Rules) plays Victor Melling, a trainer who once won 10 out of 11 years with the woman he trained.  Now washed-up, Vic is reluctant to take on the challenge.  Since he has nothing else to do and unable to resist the chance to again compete, he accepts.From here, Sandra gets beautiful, she bonds with the other girls, and she searches for the killer.

It's funny, but not as funny as it could have been. With the given material, it could have been Sandra Bullock's Next Big Hit, like the sleeper While You Were Sleeping, or the action film Speed (not to be confused with drugs), but instead we get a funny film with minimum laughs. What could have been hilarious is just funny.Ms. Bullock plays a cop who goes undercover at a beauty pageant to catch some bad guys. Unfortunately, she is a frizzle-haired she-man tom-boy, with no idea of what women really do. But everyone at the police station get a surprise after gay man Michael Caine gives her a makeover, and she turns from an ugly duckling into a beautiful swan. Of course, now she must compete in the beauty pageant, judged by William Shatner, and along the way she has to be stuck with countless beauty-freak women who powder their noses at all hours. This drives Bullock's character crazy, and I guess that's really all this film is about.Sandra Bullock is one of the most impressive actresses in Hollywood right now, mainly because she is not overly-beautiful--she can fit everyday parts. It's a bit harder to find someone like Angelina Jolie, with big breasts and puffy lips playing a cop (The Bone Collector) than seeing Bullock play one, mainly because she can seem very tom-boyish as we see in the beginning of the film. I've always thought that her jaw is (a bit) big. Her facial features seem to be a bit strong, and it kind of gives her a not-too-beautiful look, causing her to be able to play just about any role she wants. Oh, and unlike Angelina Jolie, she can act, too. Another thing respectable about Miss Bullock is that she doesn't seem to have had any surgery done to make herself appear more attractive--someone like Jolie looks like a Barbie Doll more than a human being. Therefore the only roles she can get are in films like Tomb Raider, yet because of Sandra Bullock's appearence, she can seem to fit any role.Michael Caine wouldn't be my first choice as a gay beauty expert, but his acting is so good that it doesn't matter. It's hard to even tell his character is supposed to be gay, other than a quick one or two references at the beginning of the movie. But regardless of that mess, he seems to fit the part pretty well, and delivers a good performance.William Shatner is funny in a parody role, and provides only more comic relief.Miss Congeniality was a bit disappointing, but with actors like Sandra Bullock, Benjamin Bratt, Michael Caine and William Shatner, you can't really go wrong...can you?Verdict 3/5 stars -John Ulmer "},{"Title":"Gracie undercover.

Although I don't expect each and every one of them to be of the caliber of `My Fair Lady,' it still amazes me how such a profoundly clever and witty source work can result in so many lowbrow and humorless imitations.  The latest such fiasco is `Miss Congeniality,' an alleged comedy starring Sandra Bullock as a tomboyish New York City FBI agent who is sent undercover as a contestant to help nab a killer threatening to target the Miss United States Beauty Pageant.  Ms. Bullock plays the Eliza Doolittle to Michael Caine's Professor Henry Higgins, in this case a snooty, effete `groomer' of prospective contestants whose job it is to pass the less-than-ladylike Ms. Bullock off as a viable candidate.  If Shaw was nothing else, he was a brilliant writer of scintillating dialogue.  To say that what passes for dialogue between these two characters &#150; essentially a barrage of crude, uninspired insults &#150; falls far short of Shavian wit would indeed be a massive understatement.   One of the biggest problems with the film is that Bullock, in an attempt to appear unpleasant and abrasive, manages to obscure the one quality that has sustained her in most of her previous films &#150; her innate sweetness and charm.  Unfortunately, we neither believe nor like her in this role - and without that crucial element of audience identification, the entire comedy falls to pieces.  We simply don't accept her for a second as the uncouth slob she is attempting to portray.  We know she is just `playing' at being dowdy and crude so that she can be transformed, Cinderella-like, into a lady in time for the ball.   Her prince, a fellow FBI agent played by Benjamin Bratt, starts off as a bland foil only to turn into an even blander romantic love interest.  Only Candice Bergen as the pageant's director and William Shatner as the show's emcee seem to have the slightest clue that they are even in a comedy at all.  Considering the fact that there is really only one laugh-out-loud moment in the whole movie (Bullock's attempt to tackle a supposed suspect), they might be mistaken after all.If you want to see a GOOD modern version of `Pygmalion,' (also starring Michael Caine in the Higgins role), check out 1983's delightful `Educating Rita' and skip `Miss Congeniality.'

Unfortunately, she possesses WAY too obvious a natural beauty to convince us she is the ugly duckling. A better choice would have been Cameron Diaz (Have you ever seen her without makeup?). Worse, the film mocks rather than satirizes the beauty contest business, going for easy laughs at the expense of the contestants.  Doesn't ANYBODY remember that Cloris Leachman, Linda Carter, Loni Anderson, Delta Burke, Vanessa Williams and Halle Berry got their starts as beauty contests winners?

The film does have flaws (Sandra Bullock's laugh and some over-sugary moments) but for easy on the brain entertainment that neither confirms nor contradicts Sandra Bullock's position as a Superstar. 5/10 "},{"Title":"Not totally good, but it has some charm","Date":"23 December 2000","Score":"0 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Comedy, Crime","Review":"  Believe me, I would be the last one to reccomend Miss Congeniality.  It has a conventional (not Congenial) script, dumb supporting characters (even though I can't resist laughing at William Shatner singing at the beauty pageant) and the usual sitcom drek.  But at least it has 2 things going for it, sandra Bullock who here has more charm and sexuality than ever (even if in parts Mel Gisbon in What Women Want has more femeninity than Bullock here) and it is better than Beautiful, the horrible piece from Sally Field.The story has Bullock as a tomboy fbi agent who has to go undercover as a beauty pageant contender to solve a case.  Basic, sure, but the usual dumb jokes (even if a couple are amusing) and dumb characters bring this film to a bad place.  However, Michael Caine is good for a few chuckles as a pageant consultant.  It isn't the worst, but not really compatable to go up against films liek Cast Away, Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon and Finding Forrester.

Sharper editing might have made up for director's lack of comic timing, but there is no finesse for Sandra Bullock's ham-fisted attempt at comedy. It's one of those feel-good-about- everyone movies that first offends and then takes it all back in predictably lumpy finale. Should have been a lot funnier than it is, and compares badly with similarly themed Legally Blonde, a feminist movie with real charm and wit.

All in all, it's great to see them mocking the Miss America pageant.

I assumed the movie MUST have been terrible for them to just give it away and I am surprised I actually watched it. To my surprise, however, it was most enjoyable...though mindless (at times).The film is one of these ones that you simply must suspend all sense of disbelief--otherwise it simply won't work. Sandra Bullock going from tom-boy FBI agent to nearly winning the Miss United States pageant was a bit far-fetched to say the least. But, if you can do this and stop your brain from nagging you, you'll find that the movie is often delightful.Now you may have noticed that I didn't say this was a great film or a must-see. The movie did have some rough spots (despite some people giving it a 10, this and very few movies deserve a 10). The biggest problem for me is that the setup for Bullock's character went way overboard. Sure, we are supposed to see her as a tough lady--I understood that. But they really went too far--often making her seem too tough to be real and, at times, unlikable. First, no lady who is built like that is going to be the Terminator....tough, yes, Terminator, no! Second, when she met the character played wonderfully by Michael Caine, it was as if the director gave her instructions to behave like a boorish pig. Seeing her eat with the manners of a Doberman was just too much--no one is THAT obnoxious when they eat (at least once they pass age 6). Third, the transformation was just too quick.Now, aside from these difficulties, the film was a delight at times because although the script had problems, it also had some very witty dialog and a cute resolution. In other words, it worked despite its flaws. Partly this was because when not acting boorish, it's hard not to like Miss Bullock. Partly this was because she had some excellent support. And, partly this was because this is a silly little film and silly little films are not supposed to be Shakespeare or a Merchant-Ivory production--it's allowed to be slight yet fun.Overall, a nice time-passer but far from a must see or a 10, though Bullock still scores. Also, I've seen this one more than once and it holds up very well with repeated viewings despite its few deficiencies. "},{"Title":"Modest comedy.","Date":"2 July 2009","Score":"0 out of 3 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Comedy, Crime","Review":" I guess unpretentious is as good a way as any to describe this rather loose-limbed comedy thriller. It has no particular ambition and breaks no new ground. The FBI discovers that some miscreant intends to blow up the Miss United States beauty pageant so they decide to put an undercover agent into the competition. The only field agent available is Sandra Bullock, a foul-mouthed, ill-kempt, ungroomed, violence-prone, tough-minded babe who smothers her steak in ketchup and chews it with her mouth open. She is dragged kicking and screaming through the gelled hair and the bikini wax and the proper way to walk. Benjamin Bratt is her partner and Michael Caine is the fairy who must prepare her in five days for the Magic Moment. William Shatner is the program's stage manager and Candace Bergen is the hostess.The film isn't a failure but it's a one-joke situation comedy dragged out to feature length and adorned with every gag the writers could dream up. After her thoroughly predictable transformation into a stunning, sexy beauty who emerges from the staging area with Benjamin Bratt, Bullock mutters to Bratt, I'm in a bad mood and I'm armed, so don't mess with me. Then she trips on her high heels and falls down. Behind her, Bratt winces. It's sitcom stuff.Some of the gags are better than others. Candace Bergen must explain to Bullock that the pageant is not a beauty contest but a scholarship program and that they've gotten a lot of criticism from certain quarters -- feminists, intellectuals -- ugly women. And, when asked to describe her favorite date, one contestant screws up her face with doubt and says, Gee. That's a hard one. I think I'd have to say April fifteenth, because it's not too hot or too cold and you don't need a jacket. The real problem, aside from the lack of imagination in most of the comic pratfalls, is that the target of this movie is too easy. I think the funniest send up of Miss America was in Woody Allen's Sleeper, in a scene in which his intelligence is being broken down preparatory to brainwashing. Nothing is more hilarious than Woody dressed in a gown, with a steel helmet bristling with electrodes, hearing the announcement that he is the winner. Tears stream down his cheeks as he goes into his world peace speech. The scene lasts about two minutes. This movie clocks in at about an hour and a half.The world peace speech is satirized here too, as are all the other features of the stereotype. However, the people behind the curtain don't want to be TOO hard on Miss America because, after all, people WILL watch it and cheer for their favorite. So when Shatner asks Bullock on stage what she's learned from her participation, Bullock responds that she's found a lot of new friends here and that they're not the airheads they're presumed to be and, gee, they're really swell women.That's not what the movie has shown us, however. Miss Rhode Island and Miss Hawaii almost get into a cat fight over whose state is the smallest. And the worst sins they've ever committed are stealing a pair of red panties from a store because their parents forbid ostentatious clothing. They have no talent that can't be found outside of an ordinary high school and no evident thought processes that extend beyond their body sheaths. I mean, as the old saying goes, you can't have your yogurt and eat it too.What worries me the most is that this purports to be a sarcastic editorial on people of this age and class, but it might actually be reportage. Maybe the contestants actually ARE like this, and maybe there are a substantial proportion of the American population that applaud these posturing empty shells and the values they represent.Yet, to say that these characters are fatuous dunces and the enterprise itself shallow, to say all that, a couple of observations still need to be made. The Miss America Pageant (or scholarship program) is too easy a target. It's like breaking an iridescent butterfly on the rack. And are they so terribly ignorant or is this a representative sample? A Fourth of July Poll in 2011 revealed that one out of five Americans couldn't name the country we achieved our independence from. A 2010 World Public Opinion survey found that Americans want to tackle deficits by cutting foreign aid from what they believe is the current level (27 percent of the budget) to a more prudent 13 percent. The real number is under 1 percent. And, let's face facts, some of the wisecracks are pretty witty. And, above all, William Shatner enjoys himself immensely as the pageant's host. He always enjoys himself on screen, the big ham.

A formulaic Hollywood comedy, the way they mass-produce them since the early days. Not many laughs in this one, although the cast and the characters are mostly likable enough. The predictably action-packed finale is devoid of laughs - as the Hollywood comedy formula dictates must always be. The ending even has a schmaltzy touch when Bullock rather pathetically cries (revealing her feminine side, so predictably), saying how wonderful the other Miss contestants are. So what's the message here? That Bullock the FBI agent was successfully brainwashed while being surrounded by these female nitwits? A nice touch, having Caine of all people play a gay guy, but this wasn't milked enough. Instead, the okayish relationship between Bullock and Bratt is the focal point. The attempt to uglify Bullock so she can make a convincing duckling-to-swan transition doesn't quite work. Maybe they should have gotten Sarah Jessica Parker to play the grossly unappealing pre-Miss FBI agent, and then let Bullock in once she gets a makeover. Yeah, that might be a bad idea, too, but it's Hollywood comedies we're dealing with here. "}]
