If you can watch Rudy and not have a lump in your throat during several scenes, especially the ending, then you are a hard to please critic!!  This movie deserved much better than the 7.1 than the critics gave it.  Sean Austin did a magnificent job playing overachieving Rudy and for those who ridiculed the fact that he only played a few seconds at the end of a lopsided game missed the whole point of the story.  Rudy's dream was to play football at Notre Dame and earn everyone's respect (including his doubting family).  With his lack of talent for both academics and athletics, the mere fact that he was even admitted into Notre Dame after struggling so hard to get good grades at Holy Cross (the Junior College Rudy went to in an attempt to prove himself worthy of Notre Dame since he had been out of High School for several years and made poor grades in High School.)  He overcame his learning problems that had held him back in High School and this was a monumental achievement in itself.  The scene where he was finally admitted into Notre Dame on his final attempt (he had been rejected 3 earlier times) was uplifting indeed.  Rudy overcame reading difficulties thru hard work much the same way he overcame his lack of size to make the Notre Dame's football team --thru a gut-busting, never quit attitude.  His teammates were so impressed with his attitude that they forced the coach (Dan Devine, a real jerk in the movie) to dress him for the final game.  The final scene where the entire stadium was hollering Rudy, Rudy, Rudy in an effort to get him into the game at the end was spine-tingling!  Rudy busting thru the line to sack the quarterback at the end of the game and get carried off the field with the stadium going nuts chanting his name---Well, movies don't get any better than this.  And all this really happened!!  Amazing how one of the best stories ever told in movies involve an average Joe who achieved his dream thru hard work----a Horatio Alger story indeed--10 out of 10 definitely ---For some of you critics that rated it worse than a 7 --you should take a class in movie critic reviews --you definitely would flunk my class if you gave this one a worse score than that!!

He plays the character of Rudy Ruettiger perfectly!  He was an excellent choice for the role and he deserves a great deal of credit for his work (as does the true life Rudy).  The rest of the cast was quite good as well; Jon Favreau, Ned Beatty, Lili Taylor, Charles Dutton, Robert Prosky, and Vince Vaughn (in one of his first roles).  All of the supporting cast was excellent.If you like inspirational movies, or just movies about football (although there is much more to this movie than just football), then I highly recommend you see this film.

It is sweet, but there is an honesty and a strong sense of realism at the heart of this film, which to me, provides the base of its appeal. Rudy, unlike the majority of films about athletes, paints a picture of the real everyman (basically, the jock who isn't a jock) and it does so in a way that is plausible from start to finish. Working hard, eating, breathing and sleeping the game does not mean that you will wind up the star quarterback. Rudy's struggles are genuine his family is poor and has never sent anyone to college, his grades are sub-par (largely the result of an undiagnosed learning disorder), he can't afford his junior college let alone Notre Dame and Rudy is, at best,only a moderate athlete. It is in the way that he overcomes these obstacles (not to mention the beautiful performance by Sean Astin) which provides the refreshing realism which is at core of this film. Rudy is what sports are really all about.

Wait, did I say 'football movie'? I meant movie. Period. Between the gut-wrenching acting by Sean Astin, tear-jerking moments of the climax, the miraculous true story of a short man fighting to make his lifelong dreams come true, you'll be rooting for Rudy throughout the film. Rudy's dream is a selfless act of triumph that can do nothing but good for the entire human race. You can't help but ride right along with Rudy for the roller-coaster of emotions that ensues, leading up to the greatest moment of his life, a moment that will resonate in the very fiber of your being. This movie shows that dreams really can come true. If you put your mind (and body) to it, and if you have a big enough heart, you too can accomplish anything! After watching this movie, I was inspired to try just that much harder at everything I do, in hopes of one day becoming half the man that Rudy is. This movie is genuine, heart-felt emotion that will touch the inner depths of your soul. From the biggest person to the smallest, one and all will be reaching for the tissues after enjoying, nay, living, every moment of this film. Warning don't watch the movie alone. You'll want the extra arms in the room for when you're hugging each other in celebration, and an extra voice erupting with cheers for the single greatest movie hero of all time RUDY.

The music, cinematography and acting  was excellent in this film, especially  considering the terrible film choices Sean  Astin had before embarking on this movie.  While this was really an homage to Notre  Dame football, a person could really look  at Rudy and see a little of themselves  inside the relatively small man.

You aren't crying because Bambi mother's was killed or because Jack Dawson went down with the ship; instead you are identifying with the power of the human spirit. Rudy is an ordinary man, you could even argue that he is less than ordinary in regards to his physical tributes and academic capacity, but he achieves an extraordinary feat. He leads with his heart, even when he doesn't fully understand why he is putting himself through such perils. He seeks to prove himself to others, to all those who doubted him and he thrives to achieve his goal for those few who believed in him. And eventually, when he tested in his darkest moment, his epipany comes he needs to do this for himself.Sean Astin is brilliant in his role as Notre Dame's most famous would-be underachiever. He plays Rudy with such dedication and determination that it is impossible not to be impressed by his perseverance, inspired by his courage, and touched by his passion for the game. The story is wonderfully told by director David Anspaugh and writer Angelo Pizzo. Jerry Goldsmith's score and Oliver Wood's cinematography truly capture the power and beauty of the story. This film is an incredible achievement. It touches its viewers right where it counts in the heart. And the film has its own emotional centre, its own eloquent theme which everyone can identify with. We all have dreams, but we don't all strive to attain them because sometimes our work ethnic does not live up to our aspirations. As a result, Rudy is an inspiration to anyone who thought they couldn't hang in there or don't think they have the potential to even try. You can do anything you but your heart and mind to, it is just a question of maintaining that integrity for the entire journey. Every single time I watch Rudy, tears race down my face. This film makes me want to strive for all that I thought I can be and attain the most seemingly intangible achievements in life. It is important to have things in life which help you to realize your dreams and persuade you to act on them. Rudy is mine.

However his grades are low in high school and he misses out &#150; ending up at his dad's steel mill.  When his closest friend is killed on the job, Rudy sets out to follow his dream and enlists at Holy Cross college to get his grades and takes on jobs within Notre Dame to make his dream come true.I taped this as I thought it would be the traditional sports movie where the underdog comes through to win the big game at the key moment.  Happily this film aspires to be more than that and is very obvious that it has no desire to be a football film, in fact the game isn't really shown until the final few moments of the film.  Of more interest is the look at Rudy's dream and how it is very difficult to reach, he has to work very hard to get his dream, it isn't something that he is entitled too or has dropped in his lap &#150; it is an American Dream build on work and persistence.  The story is inspiring but is also mixed in reality &#150; Rudy's dream amounts to one tackle and 8 seconds of game time.  This took away a little from his story, but also it made it a better ending &#150; his appearance is in a game already won with only seconds left, but it's HIS dream.The film is way too sentimental and mawkish at times, but it's strong theme still makes it work and be enjoyable.  The cast do a good job on the whole but it is Astin's movie and he does a great job in the lead, maybe only being a bit too nice at times.  Favreau is OK in a small role, as is Beatty but Taylor has almost nothing to do and barely shows her face.  Dutton is good as always.  However the film does rest of Astin's abilities and he does it well.Overall this is a good sports movie except it isn't really a sports movie.  Despite it being sentimental and slightly predictable it is still a good story of chasing a dream and fair comment on the fact that the `American Dream' is not just something that happens, it is something to be worked on and chased, and even then &#150; not everyone's dream will result in them being rich etc, but, it says, in America, if you work hard and persevere, then anything is possible.

Rudy's story is one that is used to demonstrate the power of single-mindedness and determination in the face of all odds. His story provides a great lesson - the brick walls aren't there to keep you out, they're only there to keep out the people who don't want something badly enough.Rudy grows up obsessed with Notre Dame football, but he lacks the physical prowess for the game and the grades for Notre Dame. He also comes from a family, headed by Ned Beatty, whose attitude is, know your place and stay there, and whose goals are to join the union, work a union job, and have a home and family. Rudy's girlfriend wants to get married, and the only person who understands his dream is his best friend. When tragedy strikes, Rudy realizes that he has to pursue his dream or he'll never be happy.This is a very inspirational film, all the more inspirational because it's true. Sean Astin gives a very natural performance as Rudy - he doesn't act in the sense of giving an emotional, big performance, but rather behaves like a young man from a lower middle class family in Joliet, Illinois, probably much as the real Rudy acted.Life can be pretty frustrating and when trying to break through a glass ceiling or a brick wall like Rudy did, it's tempting to want to give up. People today want things to happen fast, too. Rudy's compelling story says that passion and perseverance can bring you a long way. Here was a kid with no money, no family support, dyslexia, average grades, who was too wimpy for football. Watch what happens to him.

It took years for Rudy to follow but it was worth the wait. Years after Rudy, Pizzo wrote The Game of Their Lives (renamed to The Miracle Match). If you loved Rudy, make a point to see these other films. You will love them.This film is about the human heart -- it's about character, hope and dreaming. It has a lot of good lessons to teach us.

In real life, Rudy was only 5'6 and only 165 pounds when he played on the team. Playing football at that height and weight is not normal. Rudy had always been too small to play football and was told that many times by friends and family. After a tragic death of a close friend, Rudy becomes determined to attend Notre Dame and play on the football team. Rudy attends a community college to get good grades to have a chance at being admitted to Notre Dame. Through struggles of grades and life, Rudy attends Notre Dame and tries out for the team making it as a walk on. As a walk on, he may never dress for a game, but he gives it all he has at every single practice putting more heart into practice than most guys put into a championship game. If you know the story of Rudy, than you know how it will end. Yet, whether you have seen it or not, grab the tissues and prepare for the ending. You will not have tears of sorrow but tears of joy.

Eventually, Rudy grew up and graduated high school, where he was the best football player on his team. After that, he and his buddy Pete got jobs at Rudy's dad's steel mill. Rudy still dreamed of Notre Dame though. On his birthday, Rudy got an authentic Notre Dame varsity jacket from Pete. Life was going along okay when suddenly there was a big fire at the steel mill, sadly, Pete didn't make it. Immediately after the funeral, Rudy headed for Notre Dame, simply determined to get in. But his grades were never good enough. He sought council from Father Cavanaugh who got him signed up at Holy Cross Junior College. If his grades were top-notch during both semesters, he'd have a sure chance at Notre Dame. So Rudy buckled down and gave it his best. He becomes friends with Dennis Bob, or D-Bob, who tutored Rudy. He also had a habit of saying the GD-word. GD this, GD that. D-Bob wanted Rudy's help in picking up girls, so Rudy talked with all sorts of good looking chicks and eventually found the right one for him.       Rudy also got a part-time job helping out Mr. Fortune, the greenskeeper at the Notre Dame field. Rudy was also flattered to meet the coach, Ara Parseghian. Before long, all that studing and hard work paid off and it was time for Notre Dame! Well, first Rudy had to go through several rejection letters. But when he got in, he went home to tell the family. His father was quite impressed. So were his brothers.        Rudy continued to keep up the good work, giving his all at try-outs and facing cut lists. He desperately wanted to dress for a game. The other teammates felt so too, so they plopped their jerseys on new coach, Dan Devine's desk. Finally, the day of the big game arrived. Devine was reluctant to put Rudy in the game, but finally did so when teammates as well as the audience chanted Rudy, Rudy so Rudy was in and he scored!! He was carried out of the field on player's shoulders and since then, 1975, no player was carried out. So Rudy went on to graduate in 1976 and lived happily ever after.

Other than that, it's a great story, well crafted -- what more do you want from a movie?One last note many of my friends that have seen Rudy have commented to me that there really can't be families that are so fanatical about Fighting Irish football.

Sports movies are easy, because there's the built in conflict and triumph of athletic competition. But sometimes a film rises above the genre. Based on a true story, Rudy is among the best of such films, and completes the holy trinity of sports movies; Baseball - The Natural, Basketball - Hooisers, and Football - Rudy. (If you don't have them go immediately to your local video store and buy them. I'll wait here till you get back.)Sean Astin's determination and sincerity are moving. He's five feet nothing, but he actually makes the team for Notre Dame football, in a time when that meant something. Rising through staggering odds, and crushing setbacks, including the death of his best friend, working in a steel mill, a detour to junior college, and the selective admissions process at Notre Dame, he dreams the impossible dream, and then lives it. There are brilliant supporting actors; Ned Beatty as Rudy's dad, Jon Favreau as his mentor, Robert Prosky as the priest who helps him find his way, and Charles Dutton as the grounds keeper who opens doors for him, literally. The references to actual Notre Dame football give the story its foundation. But Sean Astin, never before or after better, or nearly as good, gives the performance of his young life.All sports movies are a bit predictable, and they're usually designed to put a lump in your throat, and of course they only appeal to 49% of the population (sorry), but Rudy is inspirational in a way that only a sports movie can be. It was a bit unsettling seeing Father Karras as Ara Parseghian, I kept expecting his eyes to turn yellow or something. All in all, I'd recommend this to anyone who's having a crisis of faith from the obstacles that stand between us and our goals, large and small.

The first audio CD I ever bought was the Jerry Goldsmith score, and I play it when I need a lift. The value here, lost on some, is NOT that if you persist, you'll achieve your most cherished dreams. One has to know his limitations, as Harry Callahan once said. No, the real value of this film is that there are men and women who are part of a collective undertaking -- a sports team, a military unit, a business, a musical ensemble -- who do their jobs in an unspectacular way, who are never stars, never celebrated, and yet are all-important to the functioning and success of that group. Rudy was lucky to receive (or, perhaps, ambitious enough to seek out) the recognition denied to so many who serve well but without special distinction, who never gain notoriety. In our celebrity-mad culture, where everyone wants to be a star, it's valuable to recognize that the grunts really make everything work. The stars can't succeed alone. They are beautiful only because of the Rudys and the rest of us who make it possible for them to make the most of their talent. The film's a hokey cliche because it's so true. CHANGING THE SUBJECT Can anyone point us to some factual info about Rudy Ruettiger? His own website perpetrates some of the myth seen in the film, but surely there must be some articles out there that give a factual background against which the film can be compared? For example, I believe I read somewhere that Ruettiger served in the Navy before entering college, and that the death of his best friend never occurred. Or, for example, Dan Devine has said it was HIS idea to let Rudy dress out in the Georgia Tech game, but that he permitted himself to be portrayed as a villain to heighten the screen drama. What other departures from the facts are depicted in the film? I don't mind a fictionalized film, but it would be nice to have some hard facts to compare it with. Any suggestions?

Based on the true story of Daniel 'Rudy' Reuttiger, a short, thin, talent-challenged young man who defies the odds and his family to achieve his dream of playing Notre Dame football.  Along the way, he overcomes mild dyslexia to become the first member of his family to graduate from college.The performances are very good.  Sean Astin is not necessarily associated with great performances, but he aces this one.  One of the most moving scenes in the movie is when Rudy is finally accepted into Notre Dame.  Jon Favreau is great as D-Bob. Charles Dutton almost steals the movie as Fortune, the groundskeeper who looks after Rudy and gives him some final inspiration.The beauty of this movie is that Rudy doesn't become a football star or or win the big game -- he achieves his dreams in small ways, and he never stops believing it could happen.  Along the way, he receives help from many people, not one man against the world.  This recurrent theme reaches its zenith in the final scenes, where all of his teammates conspire to get him into the game.  Football is a team sport, and life is a team pursuit.  No man makes it by himself.And one last thing, for the guy who thought that this was just a two-hour propaganda film for Notre Dame if that's all you got out of this movie, it's no big surprise that you're a Trojan fan.10 out of 10 "},{"Title":"Excellent work","Date":"15 May 2000","Score":"2 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Biography, Drama, Sport","Review":"  What can I say? I've seen the movie three times, and each time I was moved by the story of the kid who wouldn't let his dream die.Even though I grew up Protestant in Texas and loved the Longhorns, I reveled in the history and the tradition of Notre Dame football. While I was in junior high and high school, I read lots of books on the history of college football, and naturally Notre Dame was a prominent part of each book. I can only imagine how strong a pull Notre Dame would have had for a football-loving boy in a Catholic family in the Midwest in the '50s and '60s. I thought the filmmakers did a reasonable job of showing enough about the conflicts in Rudy's life without getting mired in a lot of subplots that in my opinion would've detracted from the storyline.I like the fact that they spent so much time actually developing the story of how he struggled to get to become a Notre Dame student. A lot of filmmakers might've opted to focus on the actual Notre Dame experience, which I think would've made the film a lot less effective.Anyway, the music was wonderful, Sean Astin gave a great but understated performance, all the football sequences were real enough to make you wince, my wife who knows next to nothing about football or Notre Dame loved the movie, and it made me want to head to South Bend someday and take in a game.Why do so many great sports films (Breaking Away, Hoosiers, and Rudy) take place in the upper Midwest? Just a random musing...And here's a little factoid that to the best of my knowledge is still correct--Terry Gannon, who played on North Carolina State's national championship basketball team in the early '80s and now is a sports broadcaster, has the actual helmet that the real-life Daniel Reuttiger wore in the game.

Later he decided to create a dairy farm out in the country. He bought land and about 200 cows, probably on credit. Unfortunately, according to Beatty, the cows died of disease after only a few months. Because it was the Depression, they couldn't sell the land. As a result, Rudy's grandfather disappeared, never to be seen again, and younger siblings were split up to live with other family members. We assume he left his family because of the shame of failure. Rudy's father then goes on to say that universities like Notre Dame just aren't in the cards for members of the Ruettiger family of laborers. Institutions like Notre Dame are for rich and connected people, not for those who don hard-hats at steel mills and factories.The moral of Beatty's story if you try and don't succeed, it would have been better if you hadn't tried at all. Rudy's father tells him this story at a bus station where Rudy is going to travel to South Bend, Indiana, hoping to not only enroll into Notre Dame University, but also play for their illustrious football team. Rudy decides not to take heed of his father's story and instead travels to South Bend anyway with nothing except a cheap traveling pack. Which is I think the point of Rudy that we must try and risk failure if we are to have any chance to succeed. Rudy's chances of getting into Notre Dame as a student are slim at best and almost negligible in regards to joining the Fighting Irish football team. He has every disadvantage imaginable. But he has one thing in his favor he has nothing to lose, and he knows he will have to put in 400% to achieve his goals. To give him an edge, Rudy thinks outside the box and does things other kids wouldn't have thought to do, such as befriending the grounds-keeper at the Notre Dame stadium and introducing himself to the Notre Dame coach even before he's a student. But his road is hard and arduous. In a very interesting shot about mid-way through the film, we see Rudy on the outside of the Notre Dame stadium while a game is in-progress. The shot is a bird's eye view with Rudy at ground-level to the right of the large wall of the stadium to the left. This is the seemingly impenetrable wall Rudy is trying to climb. Physically, he is right near the stadium yet he is still on the outside.This is a remarkable film about a highly implausible story that is truly a great inspirational films. While the supporting cast is perfect for the film, it's the performance of Sean Astin as Rudy which takes us all the way. Every step of Astin as Rudy is completely believable. And the film never lapses into cliché sentiment but sticks with the facts of most of the true story, with one small change towards the end. If Astin and/or the script had ever once lapsed into idealistic fantasy it would have become almost satirical farce, but luckily it never does. It ranks as one of best sports films of all time.

His fire is almost extinguished when Pete dies in an industrial accident. This drives him to pursue his dreams which borders on delusional.The story piles on the obstacles facing Rudy.

Too small to play college football, and without good grades, it seems he is destined to work at a local factory with the rest of the guys in his family. Rudy has a dream, though. He has always dreamed of playing football at nearby Notre Dame University in South Bend, Indiana where so many of his heroes have played or coached. Despite people he loves and trusts (especially his father) telling him to forget it, he leaves Joliet behind to pursue his dream after his best friend is killed in an accident at the factory. By leaving, he alienates almost everyone, including his long-time sweetheart who ends up with one of his brothers.Rudy has to toil in a junior college for a couple of years while building up the grades he'll need for Notre Dame. During this period, he catches on as an assistant grounds keeper at Notre Dame Stadium. The head grounds keeper (superbly portrayed by Charles Dutton) sort of feels sorry for him and lets him on to the crew for minimum wage. Being around the stadium and the campus only adds fuel to Rudy's dream and his grades and work ethic get stronger.At last, Rudy is accepted to Notre Dame in a touching scene where he breaks down and thanks God. Rudy then walks on to the practice squad and takes routine beatings from the bigger, stronger scholarship players on the football team. His willingness to take these beatings, and his incredible enthusiasm rub off on the coaches and anger some of the players. Eventually, he wins everyone's respect and the players lobby coach Dan Devine to let him suit up for the last game of his senior season. Rudy is allowed to suit up, and he even makes a couple of tackles in the game against Georgia Tech! His dream is realized.This is truly an inspirational film. You don't have to be a Notre Dame fan to cheer for Rudy. This is a wonderful true-life example of a person stopping at nothing to achieve their dream.

Rudy finds out that this person was also on Notre Dame's football team, but never got to play, and quit. He points out to Rudy that not a week has gone by that I didn't regret my decision. Rudy returns to practice, and is welcomed by his teammates. He goes to Coach Parshigan, and asks to be allowed to suit up for one game the next season. The coach agrees, but later on resigns. The new coach, Dan Devine, does not see Rudy the way Parshigan did. When the last home game of the season against Georgia Tech comes, the players all want to give up thier starting spots to allow Rudy to play. Rudy fulfulls the dream of a lifetime when he gets to lead the team out of the tunnel. As it turns out, Notre Dame completely dominated Georgia Tech, and the players realize that Rudy might not get to play, despite their begging Coach Devine to let him play. The offense scores one final touchdown, with time running out, and Rudy comes on the field as a special teamer. He is then told by the assistant coach to stay on the field, and on the next play, Rudy sacks the quarterback just as time runs out. This is a very moving movie, and I would highly recommend this movie to anyone. I just added this movie to my collection, and the DVD version is the best. The real Rudy Ruttiger does a short commentary, which eveyone should see.

Sean Astin plays a character who's been through too much; but never seems to give up, no matter what the costs. Astin accomplishes this to it's total capacity. By showing the audience that working hard, never giving up, and giving it your best shot could inspire anyone to accomplish anything. Astin is also well suited for the role for his reflection of pursuit, emotion, and talent to take in the bad and the good influences.

It is no longer Joliet Catholic High School, like it was back then, but within the last decade, it became Joliet Catholic Academy.  Back then it was only a boys' school,  the girls went to St. Francis, but I am getting side tracked.  Like I said earlier, Rudy is about the story.  It is about a kid who desperatly wants to play football for Notre Dame, and after years of heartache and triumph, gets into Notre Dame and doesn't even suit up until the last game, due to his teammates bravery and courage.

Modern examples are Rocky, Hoosiers, and Breaking Away.  Rudy is in this mold.Supposedly true, Rudy tells the story of a young working class guy who, after toiling for four years in the steel mills after high school, decides to play varsity football for the University of Notre Dame.  So what if he's small of stature and short on smarts.  Rudy, like the energizer bunny just keeps on going.The movie dramatizes his four year struggle to achieve his goals.  It's a charming story and my eyes watered during the final scene.  But as the last scene fades a final text says that no other player has been carried off the field at Notre Dame since Rudy in 1975.  (Sorry for the spoiler).  I do some quick math and realize that Rudy graduated from high school in 1968, the same year I did.  I know from experience that young men who didn't go directly to college were very likely to join a rifle company in 'Nam whether they wanted to or not.  You didn't go to the mills as it seems Rudy and all his brothers did.Rudy wastes virtually nothing on side plots.  His high school girlfriend, whom he almost marries, disappears completely after he leaves for South Bend.  I'm appreciative that the film-makers didn't clutter up the landscape with sub-plots and an annoying rock and roll sound track.  Thank you.  But the draft and the war in Vietnam overshadowed everything in 1968 especially for 18-year-olds.  For me it's like trying to ignore the elephant in the living room.I liked the movie, and recommend it highly, but I'm still stuck with the question.

The first, of course, was Hoosiers, the best sports movie of all time.  Now comes Rudy, which was based on a true story, just as  Hoosiers was.Both of these films capture the mystical, idyllic quality of their era and their sport.  They bring back a sense of innocence, when people played their game just for the opportunity to play.  Neither film is about the preening, glitzy athlete who loves the limelight and high dollars.  For a change, these are films that make us feel good about sports again, films that inspire us to grow and grab and succeed no matter what the cost.  You cannot watch Rudy without almost smelling the grass in the stadium ot the fresh gold paint on the helmets.  The energy of the game is alive and almost overwhelming.I only wish that Anspaugh and Pizzo would collaborate on another true-sports movie.  The 1980 US hockey team is prime material for just such a film, and even though I have heard that such a film has already been done, that hockey team is a story that only the Anspaugh/Pizzo duo could effectively tackle.Do yourself a favor go rent Rudy and Hoosiers and watch them as many times as you can.

In my perspective, they are categorized as inspiring, moving and emotional. Some of those sports movies that are in that category are Rocky, The Natural, Hoosiers and Breaking Away. Rudy is a exception to the rule. It's premise is so moving and so touching that we forget that we're watching a story being developed. Sean Astin plays the title character and he plays a young kid from Joliet, who dreams of becoming a Norte Dame football player. His parents, especially his father, played by Ned Beatty, are shocked and try to convince Astin's character to think about his choice. The family that he lives in isn't rich, as the father said to his son. So, Rudy, Astin's character, works his way to achieve his dream. But, there are drawbacks that comes in his way when trying to pursue his dream. His older brother of the family dies during work and Rudy goes to Holy Cross. In order for Rudy to be transfers to Notre Dame, he has to have good grades and also have to be at the top of his game. Finally, Rudy does get into Notre Dame and his dreams of success falls into failures and redemption as he fights his way toward the end. As I said before, Rudy is a exception to the rule. It does has a very nice premise to the story. It is also moving in the way Astin portrays his character. This 5 foot kid is trying real hard to pursue his dream and achieve his goal. The movie is not only about sports, but also about academics. It's a familiar ground cover that most kids fall into because kids who do play sports have to be aware of their academics as well. Ned Beatty, who plays the father, gives a very fine performance. And also, Charles S. Dutton plays a janitor, who works at Notre Dame and befriends Rudy. He too give a very good and a very strong screen presence. The reason why I said that is because Dutton explains to Rudy the meaning of success and the meaning of failure. Failure is not a option. Success is a winner. Rudy works as a moving, inspiring and very well-told true story that is based on the real Rudy Ruettiger that attended Notre Dame in 1975. The movie is also directed by David Anspaugh, who also directed Hoosiers. He does know how to make a very good sport movie, with all the right tools and all the right performances to make it exceptional. ★★★ 1/2 3 1/2 stars.

This one gave me a good look at the impact that this particular school has (or had) when it comes to football in the United States. It's kind of hard to believe that all this actually happened at South Bend way back in 1975. Does that mean that it never happened anywhere else at all in history? That's kind of off-topic here, but it was good to watch nonetheless. This movie shows you what can happen when you decide you want to do something bad enough and all the (*fun stuff*) you sometimes have to go through to get there. I though Sean Astin did a stellar job in the lead role, he was a little weird here and there, but I think one of the interesting points about this movie is that in South Bend (and a lot of other US cities), football takes precedence over just about everything. I was also surprised to see Vince Vaughn's name in the credits as I definitely did not recognize him in the scrimmage scene. These players aren't professionals, even though some do make it that far, I thought Rudy did a good job shedding some light on how the sport of football rises to the top in terms on national pastimes in the nation. Also, it would have been cool to have actually been there to see the real Rudy make that sack and get carried off the field, but I'm not that old! The one thing I might have changed in this movie was to make the score within a TD or a FG vs. Georgia Tech and put Rudy in on 3rd or 4th down (even if that isn't the way it actually happened). I recommend that anyone liking a good sports story take the time to watch this and if you happen to be a fan of the Fighting Irish then you march over to your local video store and dish out the $20 to bring it home and watch it over and over and over again!

This movie deserved much better than the 7.1 than the critics gave it.  Sean Austin did a magnificent job playing overachieving Rudy and for those who ridiculed the fact that he only played a few seconds at the end of a lopsided game missed the whole point of the story.  Rudy's dream was to play football at Notre Dame and earn everyone's respect (including his doubting family).  With his lack of talent for both academics and athletics, the mere fact that he was even admitted into Notre Dame after struggling so hard to get good grades at Holy Cross (the Junior College Rudy went to in an attempt to prove himself worthy of Notre Dame since he had been out of High School for several years and made poor grades in High School.)  He overcame his learning problems that had held him back in High School and this was a monumental achievement in itself.  The scene where he was finally admitted into Notre Dame on his final attempt (he had been rejected 3 earlier times) was uplifting indeed.  Rudy overcame reading difficulties thru hard work much the same way he overcame his lack of size to make the Notre Dame's football team --thru a gut-busting, never quit attitude.  His teammates were so impressed with his attitude that they forced the coach (Dan Devine, a real jerk in the movie) to dress him for the final game.  The final scene where the entire stadium was hollering Rudy, Rudy, Rudy in an effort to get him into the game at the end was spine-tingling!  Rudy busting thru the line to sack the quaterback at the end of the game and get carried off the field with the stadium going nuts chanting his name---Well, movies don't get any better than this.

Modern film-goers are thought to be either too sophisticated and/or cynical to fall for such fare as Rudy.  Nevertheless, this is a film that can be enjoyed by both sporting neophyte and armchair quarterback alike (speaking from personal experience, even football fans who spend autumn Saturdays rooting for the real-life Irish to lose will tear up by the final scene), due to a slew of excellent dramatic performances. Sean Astin is superb at conveying Rudy's undying optimism, while the rest of the cast gives superb performances. Ned Beatty is excellent as Rudy's well-meaning father, who tries to temper his son's delusions, telling him, Notre Dame is for rich kids, smart kids, great athletes. You're a Reuttiger.  While the film dallies somewhat in emotional pandering, it hits harder than some of the first-stringers whose abuse Rudy willingly absorbs in practice with its core message that there is more Rudy than Joe Montana (a freshman QB on the 1975 Notre Dame team that the real-life Reuttiger played for) in all of us.

Now, let me make something else very clear Rudy is one of my favorite movies of all time. The reason? Great acting, great story, great characters. I connected so well with Rudy, being a lil short myself and lacking the self-esteem every now and then. I also come from a big sports-loving family big into college football. Maybe that has something to do with it. This movie made me forget it was about sports- because it really wasn't! It was about RUDY RUDY RUDY!!! The filmmakers took a very easily cliché and predictable storyline and made it unique! YEAH!! GO hobbit, GO!!!

The viewer is able to grasp onto a completely new idea- that through hard work and determination one can become awesome- and that is an idea that can be taken and used in the viewer's everyday life after watching. My life long exposure to sports films helped me make connections in my own struggle as an athlete, and movies like Rudy drove me deeper into the wonderful game of football. But what is especially inspiring is that Rudy is a true story Daniel Ruettiger, commonly known as Rudy (Shawn Astin), pursued his dream to play football for the University of Notre Dame, a dream that almost seems impossible to any young man that lacks the size, stature and the necessary athletic ability to perform such a task. Knowing that there is no possible chance of earning a starting position, Rudy wants to get on the field of a regular season game just once. Almost every person that comes to contact with Rudy in the film bombard him with doubt. You would think having parents giving constant reinforcement that he lacks the proper knowledge to be accepted into such a high class school would cause any man to quit. Rudy uses that negativity as a sort of fuel to keep his dreams alive. This film is determined to motivate any viewer through the heart and determination shown by Rudy. This is a perfect example of an underdog film.

Reminds me of my lifestory as well. People around us often judge us based on our look, our performance, rather than on potential and ability. They hold us from achieving greater goals. Then there are people who each time face this kind of perception, they become more determined. And Rudy represents the fighting kind. I liked the movie for its simplicity in making. Rudy, the main character does things like an average person, but with heart full of passion. Passion drags him to Notre Dame, a place of his dreams. The movie shows the difference between people who gets and waste opportunities, and those who wait years and years to get one. The movie is based on a true story. I highly recommend this one.

Rudy is a real-life story about a guy who was deemed unfit for college football and was able to prove his naysayers wrong. Now like most sports film, I can see from a mile away the outcome of the movie, but it doesn't really make a difference, There were still some emotional moments to be had as we see this young man's dreams come true. This film also does a good job in raising my interest in football, because these are the kind of inspirational stories I love.David Anspaugh's film is about a young adult named Rudy who aspires to play football for Notre Dame. But there are many factors standing in his way such as his lack of athleticism, living in a town where everyone works for the steel mill, lack of support from his family, and not able to afford an college education. But one day when he is finally admitted to Notre Dame, Rudy proves that he has what it takes to follow his dreams.The acting is very good. Sean Astin, in his pre-Sam days, gives a very strong performance as Rudy. The great Ned Beatty likewise delivers a great performance as Rudy's father. Charles S. Dutton gives a great performance as Rudy's boss/mentor who believes in him. Finally, Robert Prosky makes a good appearance as the priest who helped Rudy find his way.Overall, Rudy is an incredibly inspirational movie about a man who is able to follow his dreams. It is a phenomenal movie and quite sentimental. The movie is not about football, but about the themes I mentioned earlier, although this helped me raise my awareness towards the sport. From the technical standpoint, the movie works very well. I especially liked the score composed by Jerry Goldsmith. This is a very good film, and one of the best sports films of recent years.

Its goal is to most likely motivate young teens in our character, Rudy's, position, or just serve as cleverly gift-wrapped optimism. It is what many of its kind are; light, cheery, and comprised of great, capable actors.Sean Astin plays Rudy Ruettiger, a teenager attending a heavily Catholic high school, with ambition to go to Notre Dame for college. Rudy is a great football player, despite his lack of physical proportions, but his grades are far from average, which serves as the reason for him not being able to get accepted.Nonetheless, he is determined, and vows to study hard at a junior college called Holy Cross. He also manages to score a part-time job working the groundskepper at Notre Dame for the football team, the Fighting Irish. There, he is guided by Fortune (Dutton), who serves as his motivation to keep the field clean but also to not give up on his dreams. All Rudy's life he has wanted to make a tackle or even just be on the field of a football game during gametime. The film shows how far he will go to obtain that dream.In terms of performances, the film is rather engaging. Sean Astin, once more, gives a wonderful performance, making this, again, another film I have seen by him where he is splendid and convincing. I have yet to see a bad film with him. Jon Favrea also does some fine work as Rudy's friend who agrees to help him with school if he can secure him a date for the school dance.The soundtrack, composed by legendary Jerry Goldsmith, is entrancing, especially during some of the climatic sequences. Goldsmith has composed roughly one-hundred film scores and still knows how to dodge cloying sentimentality, yet is aware on how to capitalize on a big moment.Director David Anspaugh and screenwriter Angelo Pizzo collaborated on the set of Hoosiers in their own positions, respectably, and seem to have found a way to make the genre of sports dramas function as best they can even though clichés monitor the area.So why is Rudy a good film and not a great one? My main point of complaint is the ending. It feels naked and left me a tad underwhelmed. Mainly because the suspense and urgency was traded in to put emphasis on Rudy's actual dream. The nail-biting ending many sports films tend to have is that the game is on the line during the final minutes of the film. Not in Rudy's case. Its focus is something greater, but because so much was made about accomplishing Rudy's dream, I felt happy for him, but not extremely satisfied during the credits. Also, it is never truly explained how Rudy went on to pay for a college as expensive as Notre Dame's with a modest income from his family and himself.I felt more could've been done, suspense could've been created, and more emotion could've been erected. This is an inspiring film, but greatly inferior to a sports drama like Remember the Titans. One is greatly ambitious, willing to tackle many different fields in its genre. The other is a textbook drama, with poignantly satisfying moments, yet a lot of empty ones.Starring Sean Astin, Jon Favrea, Ned Beatty, and Charles S. Dutton. Directed by David Anspaugh.

But during that offseason Parseghian retired and Dan Devine came in as the new head coach of ND. Devine didn't know about the deal he made with Rudy.

It stars Sean Astin on the title role as Rudy together with Jon Favreau, Ned Beatty,Charles S. Dutton,Greta Lind,Scott Benjaminson and Lili Taylor.The screenplay was written by Angelo Pizzo and it was directed by David Anspaugh.Rudy Ruettiger grows up in Joliet, Illinois; dreaming of playing college football at the University of Notre Dame. While achieving some success with his local high school team, he lacks the grades and money to attend Notre Dame, not to mention talent and physical size. Ruettiger was much smaller than an average football player, standing just 5'6 and weighing 165 lb.Ruettiger takes a job at a local steel mill like his father Daniel, Sr.; he prepares to settle down. But when his best friend Pete is killed in an explosion there, Rudy decides to follow his dream of attending Notre Dame and playing for the Fighting Irish.He leaves for the campus, but fails to get admitted to Notre Dame. With the help of a local priest, Rudy starts at a small junior college nearby named Holy Cross, hoping to qualify for a transfer. He also manages to get a part- time job on Notre Dame's grounds keeping staff and befriends D-Bob, a graduate student at Notre Dame and a teaching assistant at his junior college. The socially-awkward D-Bob offers to tutor Rudy if he helps him meet girls. Suspecting an underlying cause to Ruettiger's previous academic problems, D-Bob has Rudy tested, and Rudy learns that he has dyslexia. Rudy learns how to overcome his disability and becomes a better student. At Christmas vacation, Rudy returns home to his family's appreciation of his report card, but is still mocked for his attempts at playing football and also dumped by his girlfriend, who starts seeing one of his brothers.During his final semester of transfer eligibility, Rudy is admitted to Notre Dame. He rushes home to tell his family. At the steel mill, his father announces it over the loudspeaker, Hey, you guys, my son's going to Notre Dame! After walking on as a non- scholarship player for the football team, Ruettiger convinces coach Ara Parseghian to give him a spot on the practice (or scout) squad. An assistant coach warns the players that 35 scholarship players won't make the roster. But, Ruettiger exhibits more drive than some of his scholarship teammates.Parseghian agrees to the young man's request to suit up for one home game in his senior year so his family and friends can see him as a member of the team. However, Parseghian steps down as coach following the 1974 season. Dan Devine succeeds him in 1975 and decides against giving Ruettiger a chance to appear at a home game. Led by team captain and All-American Roland Steele, the other seniors rise to his defense and lay their jerseys on Devine's desk, each requesting that Rudy be allowed to dress in their place. Devine relents and lets Ruettiger suit up for the final home game, against Georgia Tech. At the final home game, Steele invites Ruettiger to lead the team out of the tunnel onto the playing field. As the game comes to an end, and Notre Dame is ahead, Devine sends all the seniors to the field, but refuses to let Rudy play, despite the pleas from Steele and the assistant coaches. Then, the Notre Dame bench starts a Rudy! chant that soon goes stadium wide, and the offensive team, led by tailback Jamie O'Hare, overrules Devine's call for victory formation and they score another touchdown instead. Devine finally lets Rudy enter the field with the defensive team on the final kickoff. He stays in for the final play of the game and sacks the opposing quarterback, and is carried off on the shoulders of his teammates.The film,Rudy is undeniably sentimental.Sean Astin's performance as Rudy is so self-effacing,focused and low-key that we lose sight of the underdog formula and begin to focus on this dogged kid who won't quit. Although it was predictable,the last big scene is an emotional powerhouse that would probably provide a tear in the viewer's eyes.It was truly an inspiring sports film about a real life underdog and a person with a endless determination that transcends sports for it is relevant to many who want to find inspiration in life.

This movie makes you believe that if you do have a dream and you want it badly enough and if you are willing to work for it hard enough there will come along unseen angels who will help you fulfill it. It might be the groundsman(Fortune), D-Bob or all the players on the Norte Dame football team, there will be people who will pull you through thick and thin. The performance by Sean Austin is moving. He portrays the character of Rudy with such ease that you will begin to believe that this is how the real Rudy Ruettiger would have been. The direction and screenplay are of top notch quality. If you do truly connect to the movie the last seconds of the game when Rudy comes on the pitch and makes his tackle will indeed move you to tears. He does deserve to be carried off the field.

Sean Astin is just great in the role of the underdog fighting for his big chance, and at the end, (spoiler alert) guess what? he just made it!. The movie is so well crafted that when the whole Stadium is cheering for Rudy, we, the audience, are also cheering for him. It's emotional to the core.But, then, after the movie was over, I thought about the actual achievements made by the character, and... I thought it was pretty lame. It was his life dream, I guess, and he fought hard, but at the end it feels more like a make-a-wish story, rather than an underdog rising to the challenge story, as Rocky was. The great achievement of Rudy was not rising to the challenge but rather to make good friends and impress everyone with his effort and his unbreakable will... to just play football in a College Team. It's like a guy dedicating all his life to achieve a childhood fantasy, such as going to space, or visit Europe it's nice, but the almost obsessive nature of the dream makes it feel a little weird.And that's precisely the magic of the movie it turns this child fantasy scenario into a full-blown drama, and it's so well done, that at the end you throw all your cynicism away and you're cheering for the character fine, but it's also manipulative. I think there are far better examples of stories of people fighting for their dreams and hopes, rather than the story of a guy who just wanted to play Football.

Daniel Rudy Ruettiger always has aspirations to play for the Notre Dame Flaming Irish. His dreams were put on hold when his friend suddenly dies, Rudy is determined more than ever to play for Notre Dame much to the dismay of his wife (Lili Taylor) and is dad (Ned Beatty). Sure it's not really a football film as we are witnessed to just one game and aside from a scene in the early-goings there are no football scenes until the latter portions of the movie. The acting truly defines brilliance. Sean Astin was very stunning in his role as Rudy, his performance will make you reach out for the tissue box, but there are moments where he adds some humor to his performance. Along with his early childhood role in The Goonies and later on as Sam from The Lord of the Rings trilogy, Astin has put on a resume that spans over 25 years in the movie industry. It's a shame he's been overlooked over the years, by lesser talents like Corey Feldman and Haley Joel Osement. This guy has showcased he has charm and talent which goes together like fish and chips. Charles Dutton provides a stimulating performance as the gruff but kindhearted groundskeeper. Dutton prevents his role from being a throwback role by making it a pivotal supporting role. The musical score is something to get the party going. Sure it gets repetitive at times, it succeeds in keeping the spirit of this film alive. Sure it can be overlooked by other classic sports movies like Rocky or Raging Bull, but Rudy is right up there with the big guns. What makes this movie a standout is the wonderful acting, the never give up message behind it the story and a character you could cheer for the whole way through.

Sports films just usually do not really pump me up in that the sports scenes, or the scenes depicting the game itself being played look so fake compared to real sports. Still, this one did rather good on those points, and the actually playing of football takes a back seat to all the things the title character had to do to get on the field. The story is simple enough, a good high school football player has dreams of playing for his favorite football team, Notre Dame. So a good football player should get a scholarship, correct? Not in the case of Rudy who is very undersized. Basically, a lot of desire, but not a lot of physical talent. So he does what he can to try and first enroll at Notre Dame and then get onto the football team as a walk on. You get to see the bumps and physical pounding he endures as he basically plays kind of a practice team player, basically a guy who never sees the field, but helps the first and second and third stringers get ready for their games. So it is a bit inspiring to see this guy keep plugging away and trying his best and getting smashed. Even the regular players tell him to take it easy, but he simply tells them he has to go all out to help them prepare.

But in Indiana, especially around South Bend, it's Notre Dame which is the be all, end all for football. Very similar in culture that way to southern towns, but with a Catholic twist to it.We see young Rudy listening to records of Knute Rockne's fighting speeches and imitating them. If memory serves the one he's listening to is the same one Pat O'Brien used in Knute Rockne - All American. Astin actually makes the team when he impresses everyone with his grit and heart. And he proves to be more than a mascot type, he's an inspiration to his teammates and to the audience watching Rudy.Look for fine performances from Ned Beatty as his blue collar father, Robert Prosky as a sympathetic priest/member of the Notre Dame faculty and Charles S.

Rudy represents a person that everyone can admire. He is a person who never gives up no matter how many people discourage him and tell him that he can't achieve his dreams. This is shown in the scene when Jamie complains to Coach Parseghian that Rudy is too serious about a practice. Parseghian responds to him basically saying that if he had any bit of the heart that Rudy has, then he would have gotten so much further than he is right now. The cinematography in the movie was very focused on the emotions in it, the sound also went along with the different emotions.

To me this best part of the film is when all the players stick up for Rudy just to give him the opportunity to dress. With out the players doing what they did Rudy would have never had the opportunity to do the amazing things he did and it shows the respect he had earned from the team when in most cases walk ons are treated with out respect.

It is played in the background of almost every scene in which an important event is about to occur, such as Rudy's first visit to Notre Dame or when the team walks in to turn in their jerseys to allow Rudy to dress. Along with the sound the movement during the football scenes was very helpful in creating a sense of reality. The scenes were full of fast paced movement and ended with huge hits.

The first reason being is because it is a sports film and people can easily watch and relate to this type of movie. Due to the high paced games and hard-hitting action that usually come with this type of movie people love to watch and react to these films. The second reason that so many people love this movie is because of how motivating the character of Rudy is. Rudy not only motivates the viewers of the film, but his teammates, coaches and fans who watch him practice and give his all for the team. This reason is shown especially in one of the last scenes of the film when Rudy is given the chance to get into the game against Georgia Tech in the final seconds. This is my favorite part of the film mainly because of the way that the crowd irrupts into cheers when he takes the field. Also, when he sacks the Georgia Tech quarterback, this is one of the most motivating scenes in all of sports movies.

It may not fit the mold of what are generally thought to be classic films. But few movies will make you feel any better. This is as uplifting and inspiring as cinema gets and if you can't see that then I feel sorry for you. How anyone could not be left with a smile on their face after watching this movie is beyond me.The film's story is actually rather simple. Daniel Rudy Ruettiger grew up in Illinois with one dream...to play football for his beloved Notre Dame Fighting Irish. Unfortunately for Rudy this was essentially an impossible dream. He's much too small to play major college football and, as one character will point out, he possesses hardly a speck of athletic ability. And while he's not much of a football player Rudy isn't much of a student either. He doesn't have the grades to get into community college much less Notre Dame. But what Rudy does have is a seemingly limitless supply of heart and determination. He is going to play football at Notre Dame and nobody will ever convince him otherwise.As we follow Rudy's journey and see all the obstacles put up in his way it is almost unfathomable that he could ultimately succeed. But this is a movie about living the dream. The writer and director are never shy about tugging on the viewer's heartstrings as Rudy's story unfolds. They knew that in order for the movie to ultimately work those watching were going to have to fall in love with their main character. And sure enough, thanks in no small part to a wonderful performance from Sean Astin, Rudy is a character you embrace wholeheartedly. There are more than a few times during the film when you might find yourself with a lump in the throat. And then there's that final scene which, inevitable though it may be, packs such a tremendous emotional wallop. It's a scene which proves that yes it is OK for even the toughest of tough guys to shed a tear when watching a movie. Rare is the movie which makes you want to stand up and cheer even as you wipe the tears from your eyes. This is one of those movies. It may never make any of those lists of all-time greatest movies. But when you need a pick-me-up, when you need a little inspiration, maybe when you need to have a little bit of faith restored you can't do any better than to sit down and spend two hours in the company of this lovable underdog.

Only the soundtrack saved the director from total humiliation. First of all, Rudy sacks the QB on the last play of the game and the cheap actor they picked to play Devine just turns and smiles that smile I've hated for so many years. Why are they just standing there and not going to middle of the field. Its the end of the game! Also, notice as Rudy is carried off the field...check out the fans in the stands. Great direction you idiot!! The fans act like its a halftime shooting! Which it was! They should have been jumping, screaming, clapping. What a disaster. I've held this in for the 50..yes 50 times I've watched this film. Only the real Rudy kneeling and the fact his siblings all went to college save your directory idiot butt! VERY POOR JOB.

This is one of the better football-themed movies I have seen, mostly because it does not revolve around the tired old plot of a football team who must overcome their differences and work together to win the game. Instead, the focus here is on one person (Rudy, played nearly perfectly by Sean Astin) and how he proves he can make it to Notre Dame and play on their football team, despite what everyone said. The plot is still typical and predictable, but how well the filmmakers took a true story and turned it into something engaging and watchable is what makes this a worthwhile film. What this film teaches us is that we cannot wait around for our dreams to fall into our laps. We must work for them. Rudy had to work to get better grades, get admission to Notre Dame, get a job just to know the field better, and eventually convince the coach to let him play. It's Rudy's interactions with those he comes into contact with throughout the movie, and the effort he puts forth to everything he does, that makes this film good. Not outstanding in every way, but inspiring and uplifting, and it has a great, memorable film score as well.*** out of **** "},{"Title":"The Stone The Builders Rejected...","Date":"12 May 2009","Score":"","Genre":"Biography, Drama, Sport","Review":" Sports figures seem to have taken the place of saints in our culture, figures of veneration and inspiration who show us by example that nothing in life is impossible, that we can achieve transcendence by pure will. Witness Rudy, a moving film based on a true story of a runt who won't take no for an answer in chasing his dream.Daniel Rudy Ruettiger (Sean Astin) lacks the grades, the size, and the social status to realize his dream of playing for the fabled University of Notre Dame's football program. What he has is heart, lots of it, enough to save up tuition, attend a community college, transfer to Notre Dame, and work on Notre Dame's practice squad, the human tackling dummies which the Blue-and-Gold scrimmage against between the big games.Having dreams is what makes life tolerable, one of Rudy's friends tells him early on, when encouragement is otherwise sparse.Calling Rudy corny is missing the point. Sure, it plays with your heartstrings, but the script makes its points deftly and manipulates by subtle degrees. What makes Rudy more than tolerable is the broad, muted palette of cinematographer Oliver Wood; a serene yet surging Jerry Goldsmith score; and winning performances across the board, particularly by Astin as the slow-but-doughty title character.People who argue Rudy is a recruitment ad for Notre Dame ignore an important point The school doesn't come off too swell for much of the film. It's an imposing, elitist place, where with the exception of one priest (Robert Prosky) who tells Rudy the admissions board is a tricky bunch of squirrels, no one has much time for Rudy. Touchdown Jesus looms in the background of some scenes, a stiff, unwelcoming presence to contrast with Rudy shuffling off slump-shouldered in the foreground.All this is to set up Rudy's great trump card, that Rudy the reject is going to accomplish something important before the film is over, that Rudy, like the stone the builders rejected, will become the cornerstone of the Fighting Irish football program. Maybe that's a bit far-fetched, but the Rudy story probably gets more play now than any Notre Dame legend short of the Gipper.Speaking of George Gipp, his attributed dying words to Knute Rockne are recited by Astin, and there's also a marvelous sequence where a subdued choral version of the Notre Dame Victory March is sung over violent images from scrimmages where Rudy is pummeled and pounded into the turf. Director David Anspaugh uses such tools sparingly but effectively We never see an actual play in a football game until very near the end, which maximizes its impact.Rudy starts slow, remains a tad ponderous, and gets more than a little free with the facts (Example There was no older brother Frank ragging on Rudy about his Notre dream.) Astin's perfect coif amid otherwise direly authentic '70s hairdos always grates, but Rudy is a winner, another in a long line of sports movies that present a case for man's transcendence in an otherwise dreary plane of existence.

You Gotta Pull For This Under Dog!","Date":"2 July 2007","Score":"","Genre":"Biography, Drama, Sport","Review":" We saw that a reviewer said that RUDY was....Better Than ROCKY!, well it's really hard to say that. I mean, it's hard to compete with a Moose & Squirrel! Seriously though......It's extremely difficult to not like RUDY. After all, it contains all the elements that make for a good story. We have an underdog kid, from a Blue Collar background. This little guy dares to think and dream big.It starts out when Rudy is a young kid, but always a guy to try to keep up with the older guys. His love of Notre Dame Fotball comes about quite naturally, as his Dad, Daniel Ruttiger, Sr., proclaims that, We only watch one team in this house! Right Rudy! Young Rudy takes it all very seriously by reading, studying and even listening to old recordings of the Great Notre Dame Coach, Knute Rockne.The story jumps forth abruptly to a scene where in Rudy and his friend, Pete, are at their last football practice as Seniors at Joliet Catholic High School*, Joliet Illinois. In it we learn that Rudy, though small for football, demonstrates a bull dog tenacity that has not gone un-noticed nor unappreciated by his coaches.After being discouraged by just about everybody,including a teacher-priest, we move on to see he now settles into a job at the Steel Mill where father works and his girlfriend(since childhood)plan to marry and buy a house in the town.A sudden and bitter blow comes to Rudy. His best friend, Pete,is killed in an industrial accident at the plant. Realizing that time is running out, Rudy sets out to go and enter Notre Dame, sudden like. He has not applied and is in need of remedial work. He is befriended by Father Callahan (Robert Prosky giving his usual great performance.).The good Father gets him into the nearby Holy Cross Junior College, also run by the Holy Cross Order.Well, all of this is just the beginning. The story goes on to chronicle his struggles and the friends made along the way. Jon Favreau (D-Bob, Tutor and friend) and Charles Dutton (Fortune, N.D.Stadium Maintainence Supervisor and friend) are particularly effective and enjoyable in their roles.Well can you tell what happens next? In order to get a chance at the football team, he'll need to make good enough grades and be accepted by the N.D. Admissions Office. How will he do in this quest? Well, we all kinda know that there will be success, but just how it is accomplished, that'll have to remain unwritten here.One thing that we must keep in mind. RUDY is a biopic. It, like all of the others must follow a certain formula. Just like so many of the great biographies in the past, you are sure to have the following elements. The story will open some years earlier. The subject of the story will show some traits that serve as a foreshadowing of future events.Hence, the young Lou Gerhig in PRIDE OF THE YANKEES breaks a store window with a long drive hit off the kids' sandlot baseball field. He also has a favourite baseball card of 'rookie' George Herman Ruth, who will be a team mate as Babe Ruth when Lou reaches adulthood. Knute Rockne plays a game of pick-up tackle football and immediately displays his prowess a left end (his position in NOTRE DAME'S routing of ARMY with the forward pass. Then or now, a biopic is a biopic.One thing more. RUDY benefits from some really fine cinematography. The Camera really captures the spirit and the mood.Also the sets are just about perfect from the old neighborhood, Joliet Catholic High and especially the beautiful and magnificent Campus of Notre Dame. See the film.Rent it or better yet, buy it soon! It's a keeper, guaranteed, so help me Lord! * The scenes set at Joliet Catholic High School, the Football Field and the Funeral at the Church, were all filmed at the old campus of St.Rita High School, located near 63rd Street & Western Avenue on the Southwest Side of Chicago. I can vouch for it, being an Alumnus of the joint.

The fact that it's based (quite closely I understand) on a true story makes it all the better.  I first became aware of Rudy's story on a CBS Sunday Morning piece, and actually met Lou Holtz after the season it was filmed at Notre Dame Stadium, but before its release.  You do not have to be a football fan (which I am) or a Notre Dame fan (which I'm not) to enjoy this movie, but it would help.  Football as a metaphor for life is hardly a new concept to the movies, or to coaches, or to sportswriters, but this movie is unusually adept at making the application.  Anyone who has ever seen a movie can see where the plot is going and the emotional manipulation of the viewer is straightfoward and blatant, but far from ruining the picture somehow enhances it.

Also during Rudy's senior year, the background music and late autumn scenes were both breathtaking, yet with the realization that time was running out on Rudy's last season and his last chance to play. Finally, it was neat to see how the other players gradually came to appreciate Rudy for his stick-to-itiveness, to the point where each of the starters asked Coach Divine to let Rudy dress in their place. Only problem with that in real life it never happened that way. Coach Divine had every intention to let Rudy play and was rather angry that the movie portrayed him otherwise. Still though, it added to the drama. My favorite scene of all is when Fortune (Charles Dutton)encourages Rudy to go to his final practice because if he doesn't, he'll regret it for the rest of his life, letting them get the best of you.My only criticism is with the excessive profanity coming from Rudy's friend at Holy Cross. I try not to let a few bad words bother me, but when it's excessive and really adds nothing whatsoever to the story. I mean, really, how would this movie have been any worse without the friend's repeated use of G..D..?

Director Anspaugh also made the film HOOSIERS, which is certainly a lot better than this one but there's no question that this is yet another winning entry in a genre that can deliver the goods when they get it right. I think these sports movies remain so popular simply because I'm sure everyone has a dream but more often than not these dreams go unfulfilled so when something special comes along and someone does get to fulfill these dreams, it makes for a terrific story and that's pretty much what we've got here. This entire movie is built around everyone telling Rudy it would be impossible for him to even get into Notre Dame let alone actually make the team. What's interesting is that Rudy never dreams about actually playing but instead he just wants to wear the uniform of the team he and his father (Ned Beatty) love. The movie actually contains very little sports stuff as the entire first hour is pretty much building Rudy's relationship with various people including a brain (Jon Favreau) who helps him with his grades and a grounds keeper (Charles S. Dutton) who begins to feel for him. These relationships gets a lot of the running time and it certainly helps make the movie as it shows someone certainly needs help in following their dreams and at times needs a little push in the right direction. I also thought the relationship between Rudy and his relatives made for some nice drama. This was somewhat of a comeback for Astin who made a name for himself years earlier in various teen movies but he does a terrific job here and certainly delivers the performance of his career. The amount of passion and soul he brings to the role certainly makes you care for Rudy and want to see him succeed. The ending is where a lot of the emotion comes from but for me the highlight is when Astin reads the final letter to see if he gets into the school or not. Favreau adds some nice laughs in his supporting role and Beatty is extremely strong as the father. Dutton also gets to shine in a couple good, motivational scenes. I think the one fault with RUDY is that they spend a bit too much time at the start showing how no one believes in the guy. I think there was a bit too much of this as the point is made very clearly and after a while it just seems like we're being hit over the head with the stuff. Jerry Goldsmith's passionate score also brings a lot of emotion to the film. While not one of the greatest sports movies ever made, this is still a very entertaining and moving film that I'm sure will remain a favorite to many people.

There have been a lot of movies come out about incredible athletes who've accomplished great things like The Express and Glory Road and The Rookie. The people depicted in these movies had natural talent and they pushed themselves to reach their potential. While impressive, they don't hold a candle to this Hobbit ;-). Rudy had no talent, no natural ability, and subsequently almost nobody who believed in his impossible dream. Rudy had more than that. He had heart and an unquenchable determination. This story is the essence of the triumph of the human spirit. The soundtrack is almost equally moving. Incidentally, it is featured regularly throughout Disneyland on the walkways. It makes me think of the angels in heaven who shout for joy when they see a mere 5 foot nothing', a hundred and nothing' mortal who finally gets it! You CAN accomplish ANYTHING in spite of the lack of talent or resources or support IF you have the heart and an unquenchable determination. Rudy, I'd give up my final game jersey for you too.

Another great reason to watch RUDY is to see the first movie JonFavreau and Vince Vaughn were in together.  Favreau has asizeable part (pun intended) as D-Bob, Rudy's faithful collegebuddy, and boy is he chunky in this one.  I really have to giveFavreau props for shedding all that weight some time betweenRUDY and SWINGERS.  I'm not exaggerating, Favreau must haveweighed a deuce and a half back when RUDY was made.  VinceVaughn plays a football team mate, but it's a very small part.  Backto Favreau, though... he was HUGE.  I'm very interested to find outhow he lost the weight.

I don't, so I guess that makes me an anomaly. Now that I've got that out of the way, this movie does a good job with playing the underdog card. The acting is good, and it does not detract in almost any of the scenes. An exception may be some of the football player actors. Slightly clunky lines and delivery there, but nothing that derails the narrative. Also, the cinematography is great; this is a very beautiful looking film. I also think the movie did a good job of capturing the feeling of the University of Notre Dame on football Saturday. So why do I not like this movie? The based on a true story claim. Look, I get that Hollywood needs to take certain liberties with the facts to make it a better product, but this movie is an instance where it just goes too far. I don't actually know much about Rudy's personal life, I am referring more to the actual finale of the movie. There are plenty of accounts of the inaccuracies of the ending game and buildup, so I won't go into it. And while I don't like some of the liberties taken with facts, I HATE the depiction of Dan Devine in this movie. This movie didn't need to have an antagonist. It is incredibly lazy how they wrote him to be a stereotypical jerk who won't let the protagonist succeed at any cost. Devine was nice guy in real life who became a convenient scapegoat for this smaltzy movie. That is absolutely TERRIBLE writing.

Whether you want a memorable drama like Remember the Titans or Any Given Sunday or a comedy like The Waterboy or the upcoming Adam Sandler/Chris Rocker starrer, The Longest Yard. It could take one scene of a football film to ruin it, one down or one play that could strongly influence it's story, whether it's based on a true story or not. Radio went down this path as it was brought to us in 2003. Based on a true, remarkable story, Radio was a memorable, football drama. However if they did one wrong thing, they could have displeased the American audiences watching their prime, favorite sport in film. Rudy was one of the earlier films to go down the rocky path compared to a football pre-season training camp. As it was based on a true story, it was one that pleased the audiences and is now memorable today.Sean Astin plays Rudy Ruettiger, a young football fan who grew up having his favorite university football team being the Notre Dame Fighting Irish. As him and his family would always gather round the television set and watch their team in action, Rudy had a dream that one day, he could play for the team. However with his small size, his brother and his father always doubted him in his efforts and that brought Rudy down. In his senior year, he was one of the most memorable players on his high school football team with only one aspiration on his mind, attending Notre Dame University and playing for the Fighting Irish. With his low grades and his only job being at a steel mill, Rudy had a bad start as nobody helped him on his journey.After the death of his best friend, Pete, he decided that was the final straw and the only thing to do was to strive for a future. As he made new friends and started to improve in life, he finally got a chance for the team after months of minimum wage work with the caretaker of the stadium. Rudy worked his way through the training camp but was only on the side team. So one day, Rudy asked the coach to play one game for the Fighting Irish. The coach granted this request as he realized Rudy had gone far enough and could only continue to prove all the people who doubted him wrong. During the game, Rudy was called in to play and won the game heroically as he was carried around the field. Rudy had fulfilled his dreams.This great true story was brought from the acting of Sean Astin. With this being one of the earlier roles in his career pre-Lord-of-the-Rings, I believe Sean Astin did a fine job portraying this true story. The movie has its fair share of downsides unfortunately. Since it is a true story, it's terribly predictable but the filmmakers worked with this and tried to incorporate surprises with these moments. The story may sometimes feel very lagged and sluggish and even unappealing sometimes. Sometimes you think Rudy is inhuman with his disparity just to get into Notre Dame with his crazy antics and über-determination. However we see this is all worth it with the film's conclusion.Overall, Rudy is on the list of one of the most memorable football films out there. It has its problems but they can be forgotten if you just sit back and enjoy the film. For a look into the future, I think it's going to be hard to make any excellent football films but The Longest Yard looks promising in the comedy department. Having said that, Rudy will be one of those remembered football movies to be shown in years from now.My Rating 7.5/10 (A Low 7.5) Eliason A.

It's about a young college student who has had a lifelong dream to play for Notre Dame.  Well there's some problems that interfere with that.  His size for example.  When he was a child, his brothers and sisters told him that he could never play for Notre Dame because he was too thin and didn't have enough muscle.  I really can't remember much about this movie, but I do remember (and laughed at) a scene in which one guy told another guy to wipe his ass!  This reminded me of a chubby Native American girl who went to my school.  She told a skinny Caucasian (white) girl to wipe her butt.  After the movie was over, my CP writing teacher gave us each a worksheet to fill out about the movie and it included questions about us and what goals we would like to reach.

The acting is shallow and one dimensional. I think a cardboard cutout would have been more convincing in the lead role. And the ending is totally predictable (if you can make it to the end without falling asleep). It could have been a great story, but somehow they've managed to turn a potentially inspiring story into something more boring than watching a Bob Ross show in slow motion.Icing on the cake, is the grandiose sound track. It just doesn't match what your viewing. There's nothing happening and the overly orchestrated background music sounds as if something incredible is going on.

Yes, I do believe. I believe this is one heap of steaming, stinking poop. And it's barely an excuse that it's based on a true story. It's ridiculous to get more than mildly impressed with the achievements of poor ugly duckling Rudy. I mean, it's hard for me to let myself go gaga for someone that is so obsessed with a senseless, brutal, IQ deficient game as football. I played some football in school and never thought much more of it than as a good workout and an opportunity to vent savagely. Any hope of being mentally challenged vanishes when it becomes clear that the 300 pound illiterate coming at you is hoping to introduce you to your maker. The only smart move is to run. I was undersized, not quite as much as Rudy, but I at least had sense enough to recognize the dangers as pointless. Daniel E. 'Rudy' Ruettiger, in all fairness, just doesn't have the intellectual capacity for this awareness, so maybe he can be excused. But apparently neither do the film's creators express a broader awareness in this overly sentimental Rah Rah Cheer fest. Corny musical cues, rousing poetic pep talks, fast cut game day montages are all great devices, but artistic or even social value demand more than making you feel good. You should be enlightened, broadened, and even &#x97; yeah I'm gonna say it &#x97; educated; or have you forgotten that this is a COLLEGE sports story. The better filmmakers educate very subtly, indirectly. North Dallas Forty did exactly that, all the while respecting the efforts and sacrifices made by our modern day gladiators. And to a certain degree so did The Longest Yard, where at least the bone crushing, spine snapping, brain melting criminally savage violence is occurring where it's slightly more appropriate &#x97; behind prison bars. And the fact that college sports, even back in 1975, especially football, are such commercially dominated, ultimately corrupt enterprises, is never addressed. It all adds up to just a short sighted, simple minded celebration of a clichéd and hollow conception of a now somewhat disreputable athletic activity. Rudy is shamelessly manipulative; it's cynically pandering to a deluded public &#x97; that's you.People who compare this film to Rocky forget that for many of us fans of that 70s classic, that film's greatest winning quality was it's comical manner, it's absurd self indulgence. I don't cheer for Rocky because he's the under dog, I cheer because the film actually acknowledges just how ridiculous the whole overblown, fantastical myth really is. I am often laughing AT it, just as it's talented director, John G. Avildsen, intended. The Rocky series immediately thereafter plummeted into a steep decline, thanks entirely to Mr. Stallone's demented control. Though Avildsen received directing credit for Rocky V, it was in name only, as he later complained publicly how Sylvester had commandeered the entire production and overrode all directorial decisions. The fabulous product speaks for itself. My point being that I'm rarely impressed with strait forward sports yarns, especially when they strive for allegorical significance. And even worse, when they're so earnestly contrive to be inspiring. Rudy is not a total failure because it's a fairly decent story, and it has some clever writing and great acting, particularly from Sean Astin. But the film avoids the bigger, obvious issue of Football's dubious social value, and never bothers to question the way we all let ourselves be lessened by it. OK, yeah, maybe we really are just primitive, aggressive animals, but indulging and celebrating the destructive, inhuman aspect of our natures is just as worthless as denying it. And that, to me, is the better story.
