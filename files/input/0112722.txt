Nor is it a rip-off of Se7en, or an exploitation flick, or any other negative labels that have been foisted upon it. Rather, it's a gripping, and largely intriguing thriller that succeeds thanks to performances by two confident female leads, competent direction, intelligent writing, and an appropriately foreboding score courtesy of Christopher Young, who's fast becoming one of my favorite film composers.Sigourney Weaver hits the right notes as the agoraphobic psychiatrist, especially early on, as we see the depths to which she has shut herself off from the outside world, creating her own safe little corner. Holly Hunter, in a role that instantly brings to mind Jane Craig from Broadcast News, is effective as the investigating detective. Hers is a performance that is three-dimensional and fully-realized.If there's a weakness in the film, it's the ongoing beef between Ruben and Nico. It's a meritless p***ing contest stemming from one character's jealousy, and could've easily been dropped or retooled. This small gripe, however, didn't deter my enjoyment of the film.Much credit has to be given to director Jon Amiel (Sommersby, Entrapment) for effectively capturing the atmosphere and tension prevalent throughout the film. In addition, writers Ann Biderman and David Madsen deserve credit for a intelligent, well-researched screenplay. No clich√©s here, just sharply-crafted dialogue. And Christopher Young's inspired score is brilliant; just listen to the theme that plays early on, as Helen calms down after a panic attack.Copyat may not be classic material, but it's a strong entry in a genre that's too often consumed by formulas and gore. Highly recommended.

After her lecture is over she visits the restroom, and is attacked by one Daryll Lee Cullum(Connick). Flash forward 13 months. We see Hudson yet again, but this time she's confined to her apartment. You see, she's now an agoraphobic, having retired after that fateful day. At the local police precinct detectives M.J. Monahan(Hunter) and Ruben Goetz(Mulroney) are tracking a killer of their own, played by William McNamara. He appears to be mimicing the MO's of various famous serial killers. Hudson hears about this over the radio and calls the precinct with some information. She speaks to Monahan, who thinks it's a crank call. Monahan and Goetz pay a little visit to Hudson's residence, carrying with them photographs of the recent crime scenes. Hudson determines the killer is indeed copying other serial killers. A while later, an unseen visitor breaks into her apartment, leaving the dress she was wearing the day she was attacked by Cullum neatly spread out on her bed. Her home is no longer safe. Monahan and Goetz have dragged her back into the world she tried to leave behind. Now Hudson must help the detectives catch the copycat before she becomes the next victim.Realistic in just about every aspect, Copycat is right up there with Silence of the Lambs. Comparisons to Seven are not unwarrented, but the plot here is more believable. A very good cast, with Weaver giving one of the best perfomances of her career. Hunter and Mulroney are also excellent. The film is provided a very tense and terrifying atmosphere, thanks to director Jon Amiel. It doesn't need to wallow in needless violence and gore, because it has what every great Thriller needs suspense on an epic scale. The violence is kept to a minimum, but what it contains can be a bit unsettling, if for no other reason than because we get to know how the killer thinks. Along the same lines, Weaver's portrayal of an agoraphobic is perfect. You don't have to imagine what Weaver is feeling when she steps out of her apartment, or what the killer is feeling while he murders his victims. You feel every bit of it, which is why this film succeeds so masterfully.Copycat is that rare film that comes along every other year or so that has the ability to pull you into it. It takes you on a most terrifying journey into the mind of a serial killer and the doctor that understands him. I can't say anything more, except that I love this film. Hitchcock would've been proud.

Copycat is about a psychologist who lectures students on serial killers, and one day finds herself to be a victim at one of her speeches. Attacked in the bathroom, she narrowly escapes death and becomes a social recluse in the years that follow -- living through the Internet, anonymously chatting on Internet chat rooms and so on and so forth.Until the terror begins again, this time involving not only the ex-pschologist (Sigourney Weaver) but also a cop played by Holly Hunter.Copycat was much better than I thought it would be. I originally saw it on TBS years ago; I remember the ads claiming it would be on, but for some reason the rights fell through and it didn't air for another month or so... through this time period I hadn't heard anything about the film, but within the very first few minutes I instantly knew it was going to be much better than the standard Silence rip-off.I may be alone here (and trust me, I know it) but I enjoy this more than Silence of the Lambs, which kind of bores me at times. Copycat is dark and unexpectedly intelligent -- it is also perfectly cast. Weaver is fine (if unexceptional) whereas Hunter's macho-female traits are put into play perfectly by her casting as a cop.The killer in the movie is played by Harry Connick Jr., and even he does a good job, which is saying quite a lot.The movie has unexpected twists and is very clever in its own right. It is undoubtedly influenced (heavily) by Silence of the Lambs but is successful in the way it adds its own qualities to the mix -- much like Se7en this is a serial killer movie cashing in on the success of Silence, but not necessarily stealing its content.Very surprised. Catch it if you can.

Copycat tells the story of a serial killer psychologist(wonderfully played by Sigourney Weaver), slowly working her way from phobias due to an attack from a serial killer, working with the law(serviceably played by a cute Holly Hunter) in search of a serial killer that kills in the previous styles of former serial killers.  The murderer uses old photos and the books of Weaver to recapture the essence of each brutal killing.  Murders are done ala Albert DeSalvo, Son of Sam, Ted Bundy, Jeffrey Dahmer, and others.  The film is very fascinating and yet very twisted too.  The killer is played with such conviction by William McNamara.  Another killer in prison(the one that attacked Weaver) is played with unusual repulsivenes by Harry Connick Jr.  The real star here is the script which has unusual intelligence for such subject matter.  There is a good deal of violence, yet a subtle humour pervades much of the discussion between the cops and even Weaver and Hunter in a few scenes.  But the thrill aspect of the film...the raw suspense...steers the picture from beginning to end.  Hunter and Weaver(particularly) do incredible jobs in their roles, and I was impressed with the film as a whole.

I know, everyone will crucify me for saying this, but I was bored by much of Se7en. I think that Copycat is far superior. As for Silence of the Lambs, comparisons - yes they are similar (with one convicted killer aiding people in catching another killer at large), and Lambs, is naturally amazing (it deserved its Oscar), though it is not as scary as Copycat. For some reason, Copycat struck the right chord with me. The small details of the killings are so clever and creepy, and they add to the atmosphere wonderfully. Sigourney Weaver is in one of the greatest roles of her career (though she is always fantastic), as is the remarkable Holly Hunter (who also provides some humor). Dermot Mulroney, William McNamara and Harry Connick Jr. round out the fine cast. However, in addition to the powerful female leads, it is the story that drives this movie. I was so hooked by it, and every twist had me on the edge of my seat. It is both terrifying AND well-made. And the score! I can't even begin to say how beautiful and haunting the music is.

At the beginning you don't really know what the movie is going about and everything is build up in a good, non-forced or overdone way. In the beginning its still a mystery who's behind the killings and it even is subtly implied that the killers could be one of the cops, or one of the other characters in the movie. The movie however takes a twist when it fully shows the killer, his preparations and his actions. The movie is at times told completely from the killers point of view. This works surprisingly effective and it doesn't ruin the tension or mystery of the movie, in any way.What makes the movie effective and also in a way distinctive is that the main characters of the movie are two female characters. They are being portrayed by about the two strongest female leading Hollywood ladies of the moment; Sigourney Weaver and Holly Hunter. They are two strong and independently, different from each other characters that know to carry the movie. The movie also has an excellent supporting cast with Harry Connick Jr. in a disturbing role, Will Patton and the fairly unknown William McNamara as the killer of the movie. The fact that he isn't as well known as an actor perhaps makes his character work out all the better.I have yet to see a Jon Amiel movie that is original on its own. His movies always heavily 'borrow' from other movies in the same genre. He's a real 'copycat' himself you may say. Copycat is really no exception to this but it this case it didn't bothered me since the execution of it all was superb and effective.The movie is basically good and tense from start till finish, due to a good pace, interesting well written and developed characters and a good overall build up. The movie perhaps at the end turns into a bit of a formulaic and simple one but it doesn't really downgrade the movie in any way. It all makes this movie one of the better genre movies of the last couple of years. The movie has basically everything in it that is needed to make a good thriller.The movie is good looking with an overall nice visual style, some nice cinematography, nimble editing and a suiting musical score from composer Christopher Young.A simply great genre movie, that deserves some more recognition and that holds up surprising well against other classic genre examples such as Silence of the Lambs and Se7en. 8/10http//bobafett1138.blogspot.com/ "}{"Title":"Effective Thriller from the 90's","Date":"5 November 2015","Score":"5 out of 5 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Crime, Drama, Mystery","Review":" In San Francisco, the criminal psychologist Helen Hudson (Sigourney Weaver) is specialized in serial-killers.

The performances of Sigourney Weaver and Holly Hunter are great and Holly Hunter is a great surprise as a detective in a thriller. There are many movies about serial-killers and the great difference in Copycat is two women in the lead roles.

Why are movies like this, in which women are victimized, raped, murdered, and otherwise brutalized, so prevelent...and seemingly popular? Is it an indication that we, as a society, enjoy seeing other people being harmed? Do we crave this kind of gratuitous violence? Have we been so inundated with this type of graphic entertainment that we've all become virtual sadists?Well, I have another theory. One supported by talking to other fans of such movies.In my experience, a lot of women are fans of these films. Just look at the Lifetime Network, which has spawned two spin-off networks, one of which shows women in jeopardy movies almost 24 hours a day. Women who watch these movies will tell you it's not because they enjoy seeing other women being brutalized. In fact, some of these movies touch on their worst fears, things they hope never happen to them, and would never wish on anyone else.I think the appeal of these movies is that, in the end, the bad guy, the stalker, rapist, or serial killer, gets punished. In real life, where the villains often get away with committing unspeakable acts, where right doesn't always win, we like seeing a movie where justice (whether at the hands of the courts, or the victims) gets done. And in a strange way, when we are shown, graphically, how truly terrifying the villain is, the true horror of his crimes, it makes his eventual downfall even more satisfying.I think we watch action, and even horror, films for the same reason. Because we know that, in the end, the day will be saved, and the bad guy will get what's coming to him. The good guys will win, which isn't always a certainty in real life.I certainly know that my favorite parts of COPYCAT weren't the scenes where the serial killer claimed another victim. But those scenes involved me in the story. Every time he killed someone else, I wanted him to be caught even more, and was that much more satisfied when he was finally stopped.

Copycat is a first-class psychological serial killer/diller/thriller nearly undone by a conventional slasher/thriller climax. The end works well enough, but once you've seen one jump-out-and-scare-us, spray-in-the-face, last-minute-save clich√© you've seen them all. The only difference in the clich√©s is how close we get to the blade going in, the skull cap blasting off, and the last minute twist being irrelevant to the story. What makes Copycat so superior to the others can be summed up in two names Sigourney Weaver and Holly Hunter. Weaver plays Helen Hudson, an authority on serial killers, in demand for lectures, consulted by the police, and a smart woman. That all changes when she is attacked by a serial killer and barely survives. The guy winds up in prison for life. Hudson winds up a prisoner, too. Thirteen months later we can see that she's been so traumatized that she has turned her apartment into a fortress. She's too frightened to venture outside. She needs liquor to get through the hours and pills and paper bags to deal with the panic attacks. She trusts few others. She deals with life through her computer. She's still an authority on serial killers, but her life has become a wasteland. (She does have that terrific San Francisco apartment. Then she discovers that there is a new killer at work, one who mimics the style of killing that other serial killers have used. When she tells the police that recent, horrible murders are being committed by one madman, that brings us to Holly Hunter, who plays police inspector M. J. Monahan. Monahan is quick, smart, feisty, small and, yeah, kinda cute. She's also tough enough to make big, male cops nervous. She's friendly, she's liked, she's prickly and no one doubts who's in charge when she's on a case. Dead bodies don't bother her too much. Monahan is a pro. Between Hudson's knowledge of serial killers, as wracked out as she is, and Monahan's gritty persistence, it's not long before we...then Hunt...then Monahan...realize Hunt has become the target for the copycat killer's affections. Now we're in the middle of a stylish, murderous cat-and-mouse game. Monahan, working with the difficult, isolated Hudson, is determined to capture this man. And the serial killer is going to go after Hudson, locked away in her fortress of an apartment. Copycat gives us every old favorite in the book...darkened hallways, closed shower curtains, empty bathrooms, cops tricked off their assignments, ingenious ways to kill...and they still work. In an added twist, the current killer seems somehow to be able to communicate to the man who attacked Hunter and who now is in a secured slammer. The only real drawback, if one doesn't mind too much the standard scares at the end, is the movie's length...more than two hours. If the director had had the energy to lop off 20 minutes the way the serial killer lops off lives, the movie, in my view, would have been even better. Even so, Copycat is a fine, intelligent movie made special by Hunter and Weaver, and with effective performances by Will Patton, Dermot Mulroney and a really unpleasant Harry Connick, Jr. The score is low-key and evocative. There's even a song by Sting and Andy Summers that the killer seems particularly fond of It's murder by numbers, one, two, three / It's as easy to learn as your a b c / Murder by numbers, one, two, three / It's as easy to learn as your a b c Now if you have a taste for this experience / And you're flushed with your very first success / Then you must try a twosome or a threesome / And you'll find your conscience bothers you much less Because it's murder by numbers, one, two, three / It's as easy to learn as your a b c.

We shouldn't be too picky however, as the story is a very innovative one, which cleverly unfolds during the tense middle, but is unable to finish in the same fashion. Even the clever, sharp twist cannot hide what is essentially an audience pleasing close.While indeed well written, both Amiel and his screenwriter struggle in the second half of the film to conceal its obvious direction, while certain characters are clearly removed on queue. Jon Amiel, true to the nineties thriller genre, has done a commendable job, providing plenty of sweaty palm scenes, gruesome murders and clever twists. Amiel also avoids the blatantly predictable, never pretending that he'll fool us, he rather gives away the obvious facts before we have a chance to second guess him.Sigourney Weaver is most convincing and enjoyable as always playing criminal psychologist Helen Hudson, whose near death torment at the hands of psycho Daryll Lee Cullum (Harry Connick Jnr. in an impressive turn-around from his usual 'nice guy' roles) has left her an agoraphobe, trapped in her home with her nerves in tatters. Alongside her is Holly Hunter, who is becoming more and more enjoyable and accomplished since her sensational performance in The Piano (not to mention a strong showing in The Firm). She plays M J Monahan, an experienced detective who doesn't lend the murders too much weight at first, but soon finds herself very much involved as the killer closes in on his objective. In good support are Dermot Mulroney, Will Patton, J.E. Freeman and John Rothman.Lensing from Laszlo Kovac is precise and efficient, and everything's tied up with some effective editing. Unfortunately what Copycat really suffers from is formulation (yes there is a serial killer flick formula now) with its similarities to Silence of the Lambs - both feature an incarcerated felon assisting the law in pursuing a serial killer. Perhaps this genre is getting tired. After Manhunter, Lambs, Henry - Portrait of a Serial Killer, Seven, Copycat and others, I believe Hollywood needs to refocus.One thing this movie does affirm is how inherently dangerous society has become. No longer is it safe for a woman (or a man for that matter) to go anywhere alone, and it seems we can't even trust a soul any more.Saturday, January 6, 1996 - Belgrave Cinema "},{"Title":"absolutely stunning","Date":"7 March 2002","Score":"3 out of 4 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Crime, Drama, Mystery","Review":" A masterpiece, sigourney weaver is on my list of favorite movie stars, it was great seeing her in this great film giving such a brilliant and believable performance in something other than aliens.

It was a typical race against time to stop this copycat serial killer before he gets his next victim. All the while, it leaves you wondering how he is going to be caught. He rarely makes mistakes and is extremely smart.Helen Hudson (Sigourney Weaver) is an expert on serial killers and their methods. She has written many books on the subject and has lectured at quite a few schools and colleges on the subject. She is eventually recruited by the police for help, due to her extense knowledge in the field. The problem is, after she was assaulted by a serial killer who was after her for testifying against him, she has become agoraphobic (sp?) and afraid to venture outside of her house.Detective Monahan (Holly Hunter) is the lead detective on the latest case of serial killings. She and her partner Reuben (Dermot Mulroney) are not even sure whether or not the recent killings are a serial killer or random murders. It takes the help of Helen to come to the conclusion they had a copycat killer on their hands, thus the name of the movie. This copycat killer was very specific, copying crime photos down to the tee. It made the movie more interesting.Daryll Lee Cullum (Harry Connick Jr.) was the serial killer that attacked Helen, which caused her to stay indoors, and eventually copied by the copycat.Upon the first hour, I thought the movie would be more of a whodunnit but we are then introduced to the killer and it becomes more of a How are they ever going to catch this guy? type of movie.Overall, the cast was excellent. Connick played a convincing serial killer. Weaver was pretty good as the expert, although I was a bit annoyed by her at times. And easily the best part of the movie was Holly Hunter. She was the stand out actress in this movie and it was her girlish charm that made her likable.

Heck no, this was a very good film with a ton of suspense throughout. Harry Connick Jr. was terrific as the serial killer Daryll Lee Cullum. His Ozark mountain looks and his interactions with Sigourney Weaver who played Dr. Helen Hudson a successful author of serial killer books, criminal profiler and psychologist.The three police officers were played by Holly Hunter (Detective Monahan) Dermot Mulroney (Reuben Goetz) and Will Patton (Nicoletti) who was in love with Detective Monahan. With the high profile serial killer Daryll Lee Cullum behind bars, he passed the time away writing to his pen pals and fan club. One of Daryll Lee's many followers was a young man played by actor William McNamara as Peter Foley, serial killer in the making. Typically from what psychologists have been able to learn about serial killers is that they each have their own modus operandi. The detectives assigned to tracking down this new serial killer are Holly Hunter and Dermot Mulroney. They approach Dr. Helen Hudson for her assistance in analyzing the murder scenes. However Dr. Hudson has been in seclusion for over a year now as she is the last (and only surviving) victim of the scary looking serial killer Daryll Lee Cullum who remains behind bars. Dr. Hunter provides the much needed assistance to Detectives Monahan and Goetz from her secluded penthouse condo. The movie is filled with suspense, a few relationships in progress with some potential for conflict, and a look alike Tom Cruise played by William McNamara as the unknown serial killer with a new modus operandi that the detectives have never seen before.I enjoy a good suspense film and I place Copycat in this category. As the great Juan Valdez (the commercial face of the Colombian coffee growers) would say, there is no copying the originality of the film Copycat!!

Suspense, intrigue and danger are never far away and the well-written screenplay and the lively pace of this movie ensure that it remains totally gripping from start to finish.Dr Helen Hudson (Sigourney Weaver) is an eminent criminal psychologist and a recognised expert on serial killers. Her knowledge of their methods and motivations is extensive and her books on the subject have achieved great success. After delivering a lecture at a university, she's followed to the ladies' room by one of her previous subjects, Daryll Lee Cullum (Harry Connick Jnr) who viciously attacks her and leaves her hanging by her neck from a high level over a toilet cubicle. She's soon rescued but the trauma she suffers turns her into an agoraphobic recluse who becomes a virtual prisoner in her own luxury apartment.Some time later, Detective Inspector M.J. Monahan (Holly Hunter) and her partner Detective Inspector Reuben Goetz (Dermot Mulroney) are investigating a series of murders in the San Francisco area and suspect that they might all be the work of one man. They seek the assistance of Dr Hudson because her specialised knowledge should enable them to track down the killer significantly quicker than they could without her help. Dr Hudson lives in a constant state of fear, suffers regular panic attacks and relies heavily on pills and alcohol to enable her to cope. Nevertheless, she does agree to help and soon recognises that the killer is copying the methods used by previous serial killers.Dr Hudson is able to identify the order in which the murderer is copying the famous serial killers and this proves to be helpful in deducing where he might strike next. She becomes increasingly terrified however, when the murderer starts to contact her via the Internet and both her and Monahan then feel seriously threatened when it becomes apparent that he's targeting them as his next victims.Hudson and Monahan are well-developed characters and the performances of Sigourney Weaver and Holly Hunter certainly do them justice. Weaver is particularly good at conveying the state of terror in which her character lives whilst at the same time showing that before her breakdown, she was an indomitable and rather arrogant person. Monahan, on the other hand is interesting as a woman who operates successfully in a male dominated environment without losing her femininity. She's both tough and friendly but also secure enough to function in her role without feeling that she has to assume the characteristics of her male colleagues. Harry Connick Jnr is scary and idiosyncratic and provides the most memorable supporting performance in his small but very significant role.Copycat begins impressively with an attention grabbing sequence which culminates in the attack on Dr Hudson and then continues to keep the audience's interest high by following Monahan's investigation. The action takes place in an atmosphere that's consistently tense and disturbing and Jon Amiel's direction is exemplary.

These ones in particular are very grounded in reality, but there are still things that set them apart from ones in movies based more on real life serial killers. After about 90 minutes, the fear brought on by Michael Myers starts to fade and you come back into reality, where he doesn't exist. However, killers do exist in the real world and so we have to be careful. Movies that are inspired by real killers have often been very successful. 'The Silence of the Lambs' is probably the most talked about of these type of Thrillers and has influenced many films since, such as this 1995 hit. Though there are definite similarities between the two, the latter is not a copycat of that earlier film and without a doubt has a life all it's own, and a strong one.Pros First rate performances from everyone here. Taut direction. Excellent screenplay. Beautifully scored. Cinematography is pleasing to the eyes. Riveting from start to finish. Well-paced. The filmmakers do more than fine at making this realistic, so squeamish beware. Plenty of nice twists and turns.Cons May have to suspend your disbelief at times. Killer's identity may have been revealed a bit too early.Final thoughts This very easily could have just been a 'Silence' wannabe, but lucky for us that's not the case. Though a bit contrived, 'Copycat' is a different but still highly effective movie about serial killers that will keep you on the edge of your seat until the very end.

He wants to construct a narrative with his murders, and give the police a heightened sense of sullied significance. He's a disciple of the infamous sequential butchers of the past, and each of his murder scenes is meticulously directed to refer to the crimes by Son of Sam, Boston and Hillside.That consideration of little fine points longs for an audience, and the killer has one in Sigourney Weaver, a criminal psychologist who has written the book on serial killers and is renowned in said domain. The movie opens as Weaver is giving a lecture. In the audience is one of her former clients, serial killer Daryll Lee Cullum, played in a curious but quite successful piece of casting in the performance of pop-jazz musician Harry Connick, Jr., who smirks perversely with bad teeth. She blinks and he's gone, but she should know better than to go into the women's restroom thereafter.What happens there turns Weaver agoraphobic, and she spends the next year or so hiding in her apartment and drinking too much, so petrified of the world she has to use a broom to pull the newspaper through the front door. Cullum is soon behind bars, but another killer, the copycat, is operating and when Weaver figures out what he's doing, she calls the police officer supervising the investigation. That would be Holly Hunter, a dainty woman in rooms that are otherwise full of big men. She is outgoing, chipper, warm-hearted and affable, and almost talks down to her superiors and burly colleagues.The tension marches along rather foreseen lines. Cullum, who is in jail, looks as if to have a connection with the copycat. And naturally one of the copycat's prey is going to be Sigourney Weaver, who walks through her shadowy apartment and takes showers and enacts all of the other potboiler commonplaces. She also consumes an excessive expanse of time hanging half-strangled in a bathroom, both at the beginning and when the cop busts in, he lets her just hang there while he's looking for his arrest. What's more, I didn't know one could ever reply to completely anonymous email.The movie is surprisingly anti-climactic, ending up precisely where we thought it would and wrapping up with haste. Before you know it, a layered, suspenseful cop thriller has just dispersed. This fairly simple nut to crack does however impart relatively novel characters and makes them more crucial than a clockwork plot. Weaver is good, if in an indentured role. You will be unable to see Harry Connick, Jr. the same way ever again, and Hunter is in her domain as the tough cop, building, within the limitations this genre picture, one of the more fully developed characters of the 1990s thrillers.

And not just any killer, but one who is copying the methods, with frightening accuracy, of past serial killers. And he is intentionally drawing Helen into his game.The clever premise here is undoubtedly what carries this suspense thriller with its ferocious velocity. Not only did many of the events fictionalized here actually happen (with some storytelling liberties, nonetheless), but the element of danger for protagonists here is absolutely superb. The killer is also one of the most clever and his obsession with past murderers like him makes him creepy in that he is literally reviving a nightmare many thought has long since past. Also it is really more than one nightmare, but a taste of many woven into one sick game.The cinematography is also very good and keeps you right on the edge throughout, but especially during the knockout climax. Se7en and Dr. Hannibal Lecter have seemed to overshadowed many other movie serial killers (the more real type, not slasher psychos) and this is a drastically underrated suspense gem.

Sigourney Weaver was certainly intelligent enough to realize the killer wanted her alive at all costs, so she would have feigned suicide earlier, before Ms. Hunter came on the scene, in order to throw him into a panic. Secondly, any police detective would've inspected the dead body and gotten Ms. Weaver down first, rather than search for the killer as she did. Thus she would have discovered the killer's ruse and foiled his plans. Once again, plot propulsion overcomes believability and intelligence in another typical Hollywood star vehicle. Also, when Ms. Weaver finally breaks free, why doesn't she just go out the way Ms. hunter just came in moments before? Because that way she wouldn't have run into a chain-link fence. Blah!

Weaver and Hunter are both terrific in their respective roles. I have always liked the annoying victim device in movies, especially here, because it really brings out the inner workings behind each cop that works with her. Rarely do films like this give you such three-dimensional characters.I also liked the outrageousness of the serial killer. Most serial killers want to be caught, they want to be put on display for their own brilliance and they want to meet the person who finally figured it out. Just like Connick's Darryl, who wants nothing more than to out-maneuver Weaver, the woman who out-maneuvered him, for the simple joy of ego gratification.I didn't like, and was disappointed by, all of the dumb little computer tricks that the killer used to taunt Weaver and the police. It seemed like it was done just to introduce the element of electronic media so it appeared to be a modern story. I was also very put off and confused by the use of the Police song Murder by Numbers as a piece of evidence. Weaver attempts to psychoanalyze it as if the killer wrote the song. It's ludicrous even if the killer uses the song as an anthem. This was an extremely unwieldy section of the movie and does not make for good viewing, whether or not you're familiar with the song. But these are only small points in a good movie overall.

Dermot Mulroney is limited as Hunter's partner whose fate is obvious. Harry Connick Jr. is effective as a psychotic obsessed with Weaver. What is interesting is that Weaver must face him in order to obtain information, and he demands items such as her panties.

This movie is very underrated. I liked it from the first time I saw it at the cinema - and I recall I felt an actual thrill at the end scene, thinking that was the thrill I wanted to feel in The Silence of the Lambs. The two movies share a lot in common. While Foster, Hopkins and Ted Levine gave a fantastic performance in Silence of the Lambs, I always felt a bit disappointed by the movie, especially after it was given such high expectations. But Copycat did just that.Both movies deal with serial killers, have strong female lead actress(es), good score, great performances, an outsider expert who is locked and a serial killer who copycats other serial killers (well, in Silence of the Lambs he wasn't really a copycat, the writers just took elements from Ted Bundy and Ed Gein to build his character and actions). While Silence of the Lambs is considered a masterpiece, I have to say that I always enjoyed Copycat a lot more. I also never understood some of the motivations in Silence of the Lambs, like the reason Hannibal is helping Clarice and trying so hard to get inside her head, and certain plot points.This is the way you make an excellent thriller.

Not long afterward another serial killing begins and Detective M.J. Monahan (Holly Hunter) is assigned to investigate. This leads her to Helen who becomes an invaluable resource in tracking down the serial killer. Unfortunately, this also results in the serial killer targeting both of them as well. Now rather than reveal any more of this movie I will just say that while I enjoyed it I must also admit that one or two scenes seemed a bit implausible.

I didn't find Copycat to be a great movie, but I liked how they build everything up. Probably my favorite scene was the video that turns the woman in the bathtub into the dancing hippie, but what Sigourney Weaver's character does during the climax is its own experience.Personally, I wish that there were more movies in which women get tough against danger.

The intricate back story draws the viewer in almost immediately. The pacing of Copycat is just right, sometimes crawling (and thereby building anticipation), and sometimes moving at a frantic speed, when things actually happen.

It's the characters, all well acted. Even though we don't really like Hunter's shrewd on the ball cop character, a real pestering and intimidating sort, what she brought to this role was was Mulroney was half likable as her younger partner. The faceless killer, who's copying infamous serial killers, and how they killed, right down to the letter t, is not the usual norm of serial killers. He's not scary or seemingly disturbed, while also being a young pup. This doesn't help the terrifying element of scary factor of the film, where really, it's not that much of a scary film, especially when comparing to the brilliant, and hauntingly scarring se7en, which I saw the preview for this one, when attending Se7en, I should note. Weaver is a brilliant serial killer profiler, who becomes agoraphobic, after a horrific incident, which almost took her life, when being attacked by a nutter Daryl Lee Cullum (an unbelievably great performance by Harry Connick Jnr) in the only really effectively scary and tense part. The level of other, mostly great performances, just can't match his, including brilliant and underused actor J.E. Freeman (Wild At Heart, Miller's Crossing) and Hunter's and Mulroney's grouchy inspector. Weaver ends up with our crime fighting duo, where very soon, she stumbles onto the reality a copycating serial killer is at play here. It was great how Weaver, had a male homosexual carer, where as I said before, what really made this film likable was his interesting range of characters, that were well drama, the impulsive Hunter was what got me the most. One half hairy scene, was the placed ants that were over Weaver's bed spread, courtesy of our serial killer-Peter Curtan, who's been in avid contact with Daryl Lee Cullum. The interview with Weaver and Callum, via her internet was amusing. One I guess, shockingly jarring moment was when Curtan bashing our homosexual friend. Curtan's residence was strange too, as to his partner, whatever. I must say Copycat is very enjoyable film, not on par with the brilliant Se7en, even though I liked the film better. I don't know, this one just had a lot of color to it, as well as a great premise, as well as a small haunting ending, ala Daryl Lee.

Of course there are many that brush with some degenerate madness, many that thrill in the usual ways, few that leave me with insight. Manhunter is my favorite; a film that stretched us to inhabit the damaged world of the killer in a way that stretched our capacity to reason with the urges, finding them to be about touch, contact.This is minor in some ways. It is not as taut as others of its type, it feels telegraphed. Several notes are off; the ill-fitted Chinese shooting, awkward hint of romance with the cop, the villains are stock (Southern yokel and soulless yuppie) and all we know about them comes from the mouth of experts, we do not inhabit their world. And all that stuff about hippies are puzzlingly out of date.So I will not recommend this to you as a deep and lasting encounter, but we must be able to salvage in this or any film the bits that personally matter and hold potential. For me this is the notion that a woman was deeply wounded, psychologically scarred by an encounter that she carries with her. This is rendered as willingly having shut herself in her own house, distraught to even open the door to pick up the newspaper. She was an expert on serial killers, methodically explaining motive and pattern.Of course a new case that is puzzling police worms its way into her fragile self. The case as an opportunity to gather her fractured pieces and go back to being able to surmise a coherent narrative. The case itself is about revisiting the past, murders that re-stage old famous ones. A marvelous sequence fittingly shows the mysterious killer having sneaked in her place looking for her, the memory and hurt surfacing again. The finale revisits and re-stages the moment that fractured her, letting her relive it in a way that pushes her out of debilitating confines - it ends with another marvelous floating eye shot as she finally opens a door and finds herself in open air for the first time in a year.So there's a powerful contrast here that a better film could be made of, between trying to order a stack of images into a narrative and the puzzling draughts of air that blow through open windows of the soul and scatter the images about.Even so, with the pieces we have, the film is much less thrilling than Silence and Seven but probes a bit deeper.

After giving a talk on famous serial killers (including the notorious Ted Bundy) she is attacked in the women's toilets by Daryll Lee Cullum (Harry Connick Jnr). Cullum attempts to kill Hudson and is saved by the intervention of a second police officer (after Cullum had killed the first officer). Consequently, Cullum ends up in prison and 13 months down the line, Hudson has gone into retirement, has developed acrophobia and has become a recluse. However, when a spate of further killings begin, officers Monaghan (Hunter) and Goetz (Mulroney) ask Hudson to come out of retirement and assist them in tracking down the killer.I enjoyed aspects of this film and enjoyed the puzzle solving nature of the film. Red Herrings were thrown up as to the identity of the serial killer. The plot and the story structure were also great - it is fairly engrossing when the focus of the film is on the actual killer and the killings. One aspect I didn't like about this film was the unnecessary love triangle - ex boyfriend and girlfriend officers working together, ex boyfriend still loves ex girlfriend, ex boyfriend warns her partner off her, ex boyfriend and partner have pops at each other now again. Yawn!!!! It wouldn't be so bad if one reference was made, but this seemed to be a running theme for most of the middle section of the film and seemed to make the film much longer than it needed to be.Another problem I had with this film was with some of the characters themselves; Hunter and Mulroney were both really annoying at the start and just came across as a really lame double act - fortunately they became less and less annoying as the film went on so my problems with those two were only really confined to the first 30 minutes. Then we come to McNamara's role as the serial killer Peter Foley - to be fair to him his acting wasn't bad, but I felt that he was badly miscast as a villain. I think to be a convincing villain you not only need to be a good actor, but you need to have a menacing look about him. McNamara failed in this respect through no fault of his own - for me, he was just too weedy and I just couldn't take him seriously in that role. I thought that Connick Jnr as the other killer Daryll Lee Cullum was far more effective even though he was given much less screen time. There were also plot holes galore; such as Foley managing to break into Hudson's apartment and leave a book on her bed - I'm not sure how he managed to get in when there's supposed to be a police officer guarding her house, I'm not sure where he got all the ants from either. I also found it hard to believe that Foley could brings his victims home and drug them and have various photos of murders and books on serial killers - all of this without his wife knowing!!! She turns round and says 'OK, you go back to your computer' What? I can suspend disbelief for certain things, but that is just insulting your audience's intelligence. Technical aspects of the film were good such as the directing and the score. I thought that Sigourney Weaver was excellent in her respective role. It's a pity that the supporting cast were not up to the job (with the possible exception of Hunter who I thought was OK). The film ends strongly and is certainly 'thought provoking' and will make you again question who was 'really' behind all the killings.

Harry Connick, JR, is also memorable in his bad-guy role here.COPYCAT has an interesting premise, but, as horrible as the following may sound, it would have been nice if they'd taken it a bit further, having the killer imitate a few others before the big come-uppance. A little more on Peter Foley, who/why he is, and what motivates him would also have helped.

(This is a compliment). In other words, they don't make them like those thrillers anymore. Therefore, I think Copycat deserves the attention of any old-school thriller aficionado. It is less crude than Silence of the lambs and, in my opinion, more intelligent, too, but it simply suffered from the fact that it came later in time.Copycat is a movie about serial killers and, to a good extent for a commercial-purpose movie, it offers a great deal of information about the psychology and typical rituals of serial killers (apparently, the film-makers recruited world expert Robert K. Ressler for assessment and guidance throughout the making of the movie). There is one serial killer here, too, and one heroine, psychiatrist Helen Hudson, who is fighting incapacitating agoraphobia after being attacked and nearly killed by a psychopath who was obsessed with her. However, she can't help getting involved when young women start to get murdered. Helen will soon notice that the crime scenes are exact copies of grimly famous murders by famous serial killers from the past.Copycat is not a perfect movie. It does have its weaknesses some plot lines are clearly superfluous and don't really fit in with the main plot line; there are other scenes which seem to intend to exploit a certain humorous potential about M.J., the female police detective, but don't really fulfill their purpose; and the last third of the movie feels definitely rushed in, as if some significant scenes had been left off at the editing room. I also got the clear feeling that the starting point, the idea behind the story, was not exploited to the fullest, and that a great movie could have come from it.But then, again, Copycat is also better than most others in its genre, and I would definitely put it higher than most thrillers that are made these days. Both Sigourney Weaver and Holly Hunter are perfect in their roles -I especially enjoyed Hunter's character, a mix of innocence and toughness-, and, even though William McNamara has more modest acting abilities overall, in this role he did a great job. Another good point about Copycat is that it respects the pacing and the tempos of a suspenseful movie, with building-up tension and a very good and long climax.My score is 7 stars out of 10.

The killer too makes the film brilliant, his character is so twisted and seemingly evil but you can do nothing but hate him. However, in the film, you have what is essentially Seven for those with weak stomachs. The atmosphere is certainly not there, the killings while although horrible in real life do not give the same effect as those in Seven (check out the crimes committed against those accused of Lust and Sloth in Seven and you'll agree!). Here you have a killer who wouldn't look out of place in a teen comedy, and another, locked-up killer who's like something out of the Beverly Hill Billies. The music's no where near as horrifying as that of Seven's, and music plays a great part in establishing the atmosphere in these films. There's also never clever plot twists, and aside from a few interesting moments such as seeing the killer in the police station at the beginning standing around, and says hello to a cop, there's nothing for your mind to play around with, unlike the almost poetically structured ending to Seven, that will leave you confused for a while until everything clicks in your mind. I'm not saying it's a bad film, it's quite enjoyable, but I must say that in comparison to Seven, Copycat's no where near as good, and in all due respects you should see Seven instead!

Weaver is an agoraphobic psychologist that specialises in serial killers. Holly Hunter is a detective with three similar and unsolved murders on her hands.

The does eventually work out in the film's favor as it becomes more of a character piece. Patton is wonderful as a jealous ex-lover of Hunter, one that spars verbally with Mulroney, but soon becomes a tragic and sympathetic character. Connick Jr. does well in a batshit bonkers role. The acting and characters carry the movie, even if the material becomes stretched. It's predictable and surprising in equal measure, but contains wonderful moments, such as an unrelated shooting, which intrude on the main plot, but flesh out the characters. Didn't bore me once.

It was Helen's testimony at Cullum's murder trial that had him put behind bars! Going to the ladies room to compose herself, after being spooked by the crazed eyed Cullum, Helen's police bodyguard is attacked by Cullum, who was hiding in one of the stalls, and brutally slashed to death. With a helpless Helen at his mercy Cullium tries to string her up only to have the local security come to her rescue before she's strangled to death!This shocking incident leaves Helen so shook up that she soon starts to suffer from agoraphobia, fear of open spaces, and locks herself up in her spacious apartment with only her houseboy Andy, John Rothman, to communicate and keep company with. It's a year later and a number of women are murdered in the Bay, San Francisco, area that baffles the SFPD in who their killer or killers are. Knowing that the person involved in the murders is a single serial killer Helen tries to contact the police and give them advice in how to capture him. With no leads to who's committing these dastardly crimes the SFPD finally gives in and, after tracing her phone calls, comes to Helen's pad to see what she can do to help them.The cops dealing with Helen Inspector M.J Monahan, Holly Hunter, and her assistant Reuben Goetz, Dermot Mulroney, see that she's on to something and despite her mental condition, and not being a cop, put her on the case. It's soon that Helen deducts that the killer is copying the murders of a number of serial killers from the past in the way they murdered their victims. One of them is non other then the now put behind bars Daryll Lee Cullum! The person whom Helen had helped put behind bars and who in turn almost ended up murdering her!***SPOILERS*** We know almost as soon as we see him make his grand appearance who the serial killer is in the movie. Yet he's seen on the screen in a number of earlier brief cameo appearances, in order to titillate the audience, including the one where Helen is giving her lecture where he's setting almost next to her soon intended killer the crazed and almost foaming from the mouth Daryll Lee Cullm! In fact the killer later tried to kill Helen the very same way, by hanging, that Cullum tried to kill her earlier in the movie!Almost unwatchable final with the shadowy serial killer now exposed to the bright lights, in a well lit public bathroom, trying to recreate the murder scene that his hero Cullum did with him forcing Helen to watch him murder police inspector Monahan before he ends up murdering her! The only thing that went wrong in this sick scenario on the killer's part is that Helen, now not caring if she lives or dies, refused to cooperate with him!

This movie has a good cast that engages us all the way through. Sigourney Weaver is extremely effective as a professorial expert on serial killers who is now agoraphobic after she herself was traumatized a year ago by a now-jailed killer, Harry Connick, Jr. She's rich from her books, living in a very upscale apartment with her loyal helper, the gay John Rothman. But her books make her the target of a new killer, William McNamara, who has some contact with Connick. The diminutive Holly Hunter plays the lead detective who is hunting for McNamara but clues are hard to come by. She's mentoring a new cop, Dermot Mulroney. McNamara is smart, but he also wants to call attention to himself as he copies the killings of prior real-world serial killers whom Weaver has written and lectured about.Hunter is immersed in a man's world where she holds her own competently by her intellectual skills, although she's a crack shot. Devoted to her job, she's broken up with fellow cop Will Patton some time back and now has no visible love life. She's all business, but she'll disobey her boss (J.E. Freeman) when she thinks it's necessary and the situation demands it. This includes consulting with Weaver whom Freeman thinks is a flake. This is one of a number of neo-noirs that have made female detectives and lawyers central to the story. Other examples are Shadow of Doubt, Taking Lives, Jagged Edge, and Suspect. These movies both reflect and advance changing social mores in which women are moving into jobs previously dominated by men. What special skills or lacks relative to men do women bring to these social roles and what difficulties do they encounter for any number of reasons? Copycat doesn't get into that level of depth. What it shows, however, is that Hunter succeeds in a man's world by steady no-nonsense devotion to the job. She can't let up and relax or slack off as much as the men in their club do. She's not yet depicted as one of the boys.The noir elements in this neo-noir are mostly social-psychological. The police are shown as sometimes quite incompetent and, in any event, thwarted by the lone wolf killer. Society seems fairly helpless. It takes the intellect to outwit him and the police are not shown as having enough of that expertise in house. Hunter needs Weaver, but she has the skill to organize the hunt. The city, America itself, is depicted as a dangerous place in which 35 serial killers may be operating at any given time. Neither wealth nor a penthouse apartment are protection against serious threats. The main character (Weaver) is shown as seriously incapacitated by agoraphobia. A battle against this kind of criminal will not easily be won. The two killers we see on the screen are shown as intelligent but seriously twisted persons whose evil comes from poor family backgrounds. However, they have compulsive weaknesses that can prove their undoing. Knowledge is the key and Weaver has it, but it's ineffective without a physical confrontation.

It's a twist on the Silence of the Lambs/Manhunter formula, with the caged maverick whom the detectives turn to for assistance being not a demented Hannibal Lecter type locked away in a maximum security prison, but a female expert on serial killers, played by Sigourney Weaver, who confines herself to her high-security apartment because of a traumatic attack which happened several years ago. This is the film's most interesting aspect Weaver has been driven to agoraphobia by the attack, is now profoundly terrified of human beings, is scared of even opening her front door, and so conducts her entire life from behind a computer screen. Unfortunately the film completely wastes all interesting possibilities afforded by the Sigourney Weaver character.A similar thing happens to a character played by the often excellent Holly Hunter. She's a tough-cookie LA cop &#x96; a small gal in a big boy's world &#x96; but again her character is completely wasted. The film sets up two interesting female roles only to quickly discard them, using them both as mere cannon fodder. The way Weaver is tortured by serial killers for audience kicks is particularly tawdry. Interestingly, the film's serial killer likes to copy the work of other serial killers, and the film itself contains a string of scenes which copy other serial killer movies, but little is done with this self-referentiality.As with most serial killer films, the serial killer here is awkward, childlike, and gawky around women. As far back as Peeping Tom, Night of the Hunter, Rope, Psycho and Targets, serial killers have been portrayed as being representations of non-phallic sexuality (often their baldness signifies some androgyny or sexual malfunction). In each case the killer seeks to bolster a failed sense of masculinist control, often by specifically targeting women. Psycho's Norman Bates, for example, specifically kills women that sexually arouse him because he has psychically introjected the persona of the castrating mother he killed. Hitchcock's film is just one of several early serial killer films that has transmitted the motif of transvestitism and transexuality into the modern serial killer movie.Whether real life serial killers overwhelmingly conform to these portrayals is unknown (profiling of violent criminals is now being viewed as a voodoo science, and the common view that serial killers are sexual deviants is beginning to be debunked by some), but most of those heavily idolised by the news media do. David Berkowitz was obsessed with women. William Heirens, Eg Geins and Joseph Kallinger were repulsed by sex. Albert DeSalvo, the Bostom Strangler, famously stated that it really was Woman that I wanted, not any special one, just Woman with what a woman has. Henry Lee Lucas was raised as a girl and explicitly murdered women because he hated them. Gacy Bobby was a real life Norman Bates (grew breasts during puberty, hated his mother, was homosexual, had abnormal chromosomes) and Jeffrey Dahmer, Andrew Cunanan and John Wayne Gacy were homosexual. Then there are people like Issesi Sagawa, who ate his victims like Hannibal Lecter and recalls that he Wanted to possess her. Wanted to eat her. If I do she will be mine forever. In fiction, the motivation of serial killers is likewise frequently explained in terms of the need to expel to expel the feminine, the homosexual and femininity's invasion of masculinity.In Copycat's case our killer literally sets out to achieve phallic subjectivity. As white masculinity is inherently a fiction, must be continually reconstructed and rebuilt, films like this play like a hysterical response to a perceived lack of masculine identity (and deny the anti-essentialist view that serial killers are a social construct). Today, films which try to replicate these portrayals of serial killers come across looking hokey. Masculinity has changed and it is now accepted that socio-political constructs that provides men with privilege also implicitly threaten them. In response to this weakening, TV shows like Dexter portray the serial killer as bisexual vigilantes, a very Old West or American drive to reject due process and the US legal system altogether. The serial killer, who fulfils dreams of masculinity, purity, and purgative violence is explicitly abhorred, but secretly consecrated.7/10 - Worth one viewing.

A psychiatrist who studies serial killers, Helen Hudson (Sigorney Wearver) is attacked in the toilets and almost killed by a psychotic individual named Daryl Lee Cullen (Harry Connick Junior). The trauma leaves her house bound for thirteen years. When a serial killer strikes San Fransisco and she begins by helping out but gets dragged in deeper.As with most thrillers, one has to be careful in revealing the plot because if you know too much the tenseness of the movie can be destroyed. There are a couple of twists in this movie, but not as many as in one like the Color of Night. Copycat is basically about a serial killer who mimics other serial killers and delves into the psychology of why they do what they do. In is interesting some of the ideas that come out of this movie as to the mind of the serial killers.Namely it is said to be attention seeking. Serial killers are obsessive and very meticulous in what they do. They commit their crimes in exactly the same way because of this compulsive nature. Yet Hudson is able to look into Cullen's mind and say that he is not a serial killer, but rather some man who is seeking attention.I really can't delve into the psychology of this though because of my lack of knowledge. It seems that it is a very specialised field of study, but what is interesting is that the United States, what some claim to be the pinnacle of civilisation, has spawned more serial killers than anytime in history (though this is probably a misnomer since people have been killing people ever since Cain killed Abel, it is just the methods and the reasons have changed along with society). There have always been psychotic people around who have brutally murdered heaps of people, but the Americans seem to claim that their society is highly civilised yet it is socially decaying. How can a society that is civilised have the streets of the major cities war zones and have people stalking the streets killing for any reason.Though this is a happy ending movie, I think Copycat draws out a very darkside of America. A side where people will lock themselves in their homes because they are afraid to venture outside. Afraid to the point where to go outside would make them sick. Yet this movie undermines the who concept of the home being the castle and secure, and even more so, it undermines the belief that society is safe from those in gaol. As Daryl Lee Cullen says from in gaol, I may be in here but I have disciples. Even if somebody has been locked away, they may still has friends on the outside that they can control and order to do what they like.The American society is slowly decaying and the once great land of opportunity is now a tainted land of fear and loathing. Copycat portrays this in the way that one might win a battle but the war is still raging.

But there were things that irritated me about the development of the plot, as they have done in other such films that have been cited as parallels, like Se7en and Silence of the Lambs. The serial killer is entirely too competent, and knows how to do a lot of things (but we never learn how he gets his victims back to his house and smuggles them into his locked cellar), and has considerable luck For instance, he is able to break into Helen Hudson's apartment without her (or anyone else) noticing - and when the locks are changed, he is back again the same night. But, though he is generally very careful about covering his tracks, he fails to make sure that Lt. Monahan is dead (how does she manage to recover enough to follow him, anyway?). A lot of points have been made about errors in what you can and can't do with a computer, email etc. (some cited in list of Goofs), and it has been pointed out that the original serial killer would hardly be able to use mail or email unchecked. We never learn how Hudson escapes being murdered by him anyway; if the other cop rescues her, as is implied, is it likely that he wouldn't have shot the killer? And I am not expert on this, but it seems to me she is in a perfect position to kick her attackers in the face when hung up. I would also have thought an obvious thing for her to do would be carry a weapon *at all times* once she knows she's under threat - she even goes to her final meeting with the killer without one. Finally, I doubt very much that anybody could be killed instantly by having their throat cut, the way the killers do it.Perhaps all serial killer movies could be pulled apart like this, not to mention horror movies like Scream, and almost certainly that is one reason why I don't like them.

Dermot Mulroney thankfully has been in better roles than this movie, but he did well as the Detective Cassanova that his role called for. There is a sense that he and Weaver's character had some sort of intimate liason somewhere in the mix, but the film's director got cold feet in 1995 and didn't bother with showing an older woman, younger man romance here. Pity. It might have made things interesting.Harry Connick, Jr. Wow. What a performance! My goodness, I did a triple take on his role as a killer/stalker/freak. His voice to me was more frightening than the gotcha moments of the film with the tinkling annoying warning music. The last I have seen of him was Hope Floats and most recently Will and Grace. Another waste of talent, one hopes he gets a new agent or something! He should have expanded on this!All in all, it's a good movie. Stretched thin in some places, but timeless overall. Definitely one that you'll revisit from time to time when there is nothing else on!

Its strengths are many, but let's start with the acting. Holly Hunter turns in a good, solid performance, but the really good stuff comes from Sigourney Weaver and Harry Connick Jr. Weaver's role of a criminal expert paralyzed with agoraphobia after a past trauma would be fatally easy to overdo, but Weaver is convincing and horrifying in the part. Meanwhile, though Harry Connick Jr. is not on screen much, his few brief scenes are enough to give any viewer goosebumps.The minor characters work too and this is a movie when you're well advised not to let your attention wander for a second, not least because we get an early brief glimpse of the killer in a totally innocuous context.Music is well used (particularly the scene where the Weaver character views some particularly ghastly pictures while the sublime tones of Faure's In Paradisum are playing) and the camera work is good, but I was particularly intrigued with the use of computers in the movie. Both the killer and the Weaver character use them, so they are important for both the bad guys and the good. As someone who works in the IT industry, I sometimes groan when I see them in the movies. That was not the case here.Good work all round then. Recommended. Rating 7/10.

Soon after the lecture, she is nearly killed herself.  The experience frightens her so that 13 months later, she is afraid to leave the house.  But when a series of killings has a pattern, she starts harassing the police with her theories.  Two detectives, one female and one male, decide to take her seriously, and she  ends up being a consultant on the case, in which one or more killers seem to be copying the patterns of famous serial killers.  But Weaver starts getting scary messages on her computer and fears that the man who tried to kill her has gotten out.  Another complication  she is afraid to be alone at night, so the male detective spends the night with her (possible romance?).Weaver is quite good, showing genuine panic at times and very much afraid even to venture a few feet outside her door, yet mostly strong and even funny at times (When she believes she has found a way to catch the 'copycat', she says, 'Here, Kitty, Kitty, Kitty.').  I was very surprised to see Holly Hunter's name in the closing credits as the female detective, because she reminded me nothing of Hunter's other characters, although she had an adorable quality about her that did not stand out against a tough and confident exterior.  The real acting performance here was Harry Connick, Jr.  I couldn't believe it when I saw he had played the deliciously nasty prisoner who wanted to make Weaver's life miserable.  The scenes showing Weaver's fear were very effective, with strange camera work making us feel what she did.  And action scenes were quite well done though more bloody than I would have liked.  The climactic scene was especially exciting.  SPOILER  at the very end, a possible sequel involving Connick's character appears likely; he was not the 'copycat,' of course, but we always suspected him of having a role.

Average at best as far as I'm concerned.","Date":"24 November 2007","Score":"3 out of 7 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Crime, Drama, Mystery","Review":" Copycat is set in San Francisco where a serial killer is at large, homicide inspector's M.J. Monahan (Holly Hunter) & her partner Reuben Geotz (Dermot Mulroney) are on the case but are going nowhere fast. A serial killer profiler named Helen Hudson (Sigourney Weaver) who suffers from agoraphobia & has been housebound for thirteen months after a serial killer named Daryll Lee Cullum (Harry Connick Jr.) tried to kill her agrees to help the police catch the killer using her expertise. Helen quickly realises that the killer is copying other serial killers from the past in the way he kills his victims, the killer also contacts Helen & taunts her as he intends to finish the job Daryll Lee Cullum started & kill her in the way Callum wanted...Directed by Jon Amiel I am actually amazed at how many positive comments this strictly average killer thriller has, for me it's a poor mans Se7en (1995) or even The Silence of the Lambs (1991). The script by Ann Bidderman & David Madsen takes itself very seriously, is far too long, deviates from the main action too often & doesn't make the most of it's good aspects. There are some good ideas in Copycat including the idea of a serial killer copying other serial killers & the profiler suffering from agoraphobia but little is made of them & I thought Copycat was a throughly routine & disappointingly predictable thriller. For start the killer is identified too early, there's no mystery surrounding who they are at all & he isn't given any sort of motive other than 'I'm a killer & that's what I do' which is about all the motive a character like Jason Voorhees from the Friday the 13th slasher flicks is given which I didn't like at all & then there's the extremely predictable & clich√©d ending where you just know Helen will have to find strength within herself & overcome her agoraphobia in order to defeat the killer, you can just see it coming from the moment we learn she's a agoraphobic. I wasn't keen on the killers characterisation either, why at the end does he save Helen from hanging? Wasn't that his plan? To recreate & finish Daryll Lee's plan? Why save her & then instantly want to killer her again? He runs after her with a knife so why not let her hang? Surely that's what he wanted? For someone who is portrayed as so intelligent & cunning he suddenly becomes a nervous wreck & if you think about it Helen owes the killer for saving her life as much as she owes Monahan. Also why did the killer kill his wife? What serial killer was he copying then eh?Director Amiel turns in a throughly standard looking cop thriller, it has absolutely no style like Se7en did, it's not scary, most of the kills are off screen & there's no atmosphere which Se7en manage to generate so well. The gore & violence isn't that excessive, there's a couple of slit throats otherwise all the kills are off screen. The computer terminology used in Copycat is also severely questionable & basically total nonsense. What on earth was that terrible ending all about as well? It's awful & seemed more suited to a cheap horror flick that wanted to spawn a sequel. As a big fan of the telly series Quincy M.E. (1976 - 1983) I wonder if they named Hunter's character Monahan after a similar homicide detective in Quincy? I doubt it but you never know as it's not a common name.With a supposed budget of about $20,000,000 Copycat is well made but throughly bland & forgettable. There's no style here at all, shot on location in San Francisco & Los Angeles. I thought Sigourney Weaver was pretty good in this but I also thought Holly Hunter was awful, really, really bad.Copycat is an average killer thriller, it doesn't have the scares, the atmosphere or the mysterious intrigue the likes of Se7en & The Silence of the Lambs excel at & which are both far superior to this. A thriller that's not very thrilling, generally disappointing & I thought it was average at best.

"},{"Title":"Murder as Intellectual Chess","Date":"1 October 2009","Score":"1 out of 4 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Crime, Drama, Mystery","Review":" The title of this film is perhaps unfortunately appropriate in a way its makers did not intend; it struck me that Copycat is one of a number of serial killer thrillers which attempted to copy both the format and the enormous success of The Silence of the Lambs. (Other examples include The Bone Collector and Se7en).Sub-genres of crime fiction have a tendency to become predictable and bound by convention. Like its predecessors the country-house murder mysteries of the 1930s and the 'hardboiled' private eye stories of the 1940s, the serial killer movie has evolved its own set of rules and conventions. Cut off from reality and bound by a number of formulaic rules, such films frequently contain a gimmick which will enable the audience to distinguish one from another. Thus in The Silence of the Lambs and its sequel Red Dragon the gimmick was the fact that one murderer was helping the FBI catch another. The Bone Collector had a disabled detective, a gimmick copied from Rear Window and the Ironside TV series, and the Clint Eastwood vehicle Blood Work had at its centre a retired FBI operative who had recently had a heart transplant, although this did not stop him running, jumping, shooting and making love like a geriatric Dirty Harry.Copycat also has a disabled individual at its centre, although in this case the disability is psychological rather than physical. The Silence of the Lambs, Copycat, and The Bone Collector, in fact, all share one central concept. In each case the case is being handled by a young female police officer who is enthusiastic but inexperienced and therefore needs assistance from a recognised expert on the subject. In each case the expert is unable to visit the scenes of the crimes in person, leaving the young officer to do all the investigatory legwork, although the reasons for this inability vary. In The Silence of the Lambs the expert, Dr Hannibal Lecter, is himself a serial killer confined to a prison cell. In The Bone Collector Denzel Washington's character, a former detective, is unable to leave his bed because he is paralysed. And in Copycat the role of the expert is taken by Dr. Helen Hudson, a former university lecturer in criminal psychology, who has been confined to her flat by severe agoraphobia ever since being brutally attacked by a psychopath.This film also shares with Se7en (and a number of other serial killer films) the idea of a killer who is carrying out his murders according to a predetermined pattern and who has an obsession with one particular detective. In Se7en the pattern of killing was based on the concept of the seven deadly sins; here we have a killer who does not have a fixed modus operandi but who imitates the methods of other notorious serial killers such as the Boston Strangler, Ted Bundy and Jeffrey Dahmer (hence his nickname of the copycat).Serial killer movies are not, generally speaking, my favourite genre. The best I have seen are probably Richard Fleischer's Ten Rillington Place, in which Richard Attenborough gives a chilling portrayal of the real-life killer John Christie, and the original Dirty Harry. I would regard The Silence of the Lambs as a reasonably good film, with two striking performances from Anthony Hopkins and Jodie Foster, but not as the great classic which is how some of its admirers see it. Its cornering of all big five Academy Awards (only the third film to achieve this feat) owes more to a lack of competition than anything else. (1991 was not the greatest year in cinema history).The two leading roles in Copycat are played reasonably well, by Sigourney Weaver as Helen and Holly Hunter as the tough female detective M.J. Monahan. (M.J. was originally conceived as a male character, which possibly explains why she is generally known by her initials, although we do learn that her Christian names are Mary Jane). The problem I have with this film, however, has nothing to do with the acting. It goes deeper than that. As Fleischer and Attenborough showed us brilliantly in Ten Rillington Place, serial killers are generally rather seedy, outwardly inoffensive individuals who are motivated by an irrational urge to kill for the sake of killing. Dirty Harry rather evaded the subject of the killer's motivation by concentrating on the ethical dilemmas confronting the cop hunting for him, but most other films within this genre have presented us with serial killers who kill as an intellectual exercise or as part of a battle of wits with the police.In the Hannibal Lecter movies the brilliance of Anthony Hopkins' acting was able to persuade me to suspend my disbelief in the concept of murder as intellectual chess, but few other films have been able to do this. Like some other serial killer movies such as The Bone Collector and Se7en, Copycat seems detached from reality to the extent that I could no longer believe in, or care about, the characters or the situations in which they find themselves. 4/10 "}{"Title":"not bad one!","Date":"6 December 2002","Score":"1 out of 4 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Crime, Drama, Mystery","Review":"  have to say that this movie really suprised me! when i got this moive,i found that the performance of Sigourney Weaver was really brilliant!seemed like that she was really that psychologist!also the whole movie made me feel nervous all time!but one flawness here i have to tell is that the criminal was so easy to appear in front of us!just hope that it could be like the Seven,but whatever,it was not the Seven.lol~~ also there was one point i love to mention.that is the scene which the real criminal appeared frist time!it was in the lecterual hall where our psychologist was attacked!it was really a cool arrangement! i like it very much! anyway,Copycat was a good movie,even it was not good enough,but could still make ya feel thrilling!

This is major competition for Sisters. Major. The list of things this film's dumb director expected to get away with is truly staggeringly long. So, without further ado, let's go through the list of absurdities, illogicalities, and other cretinisms 1) How did Harry Connick, Jr. know that Weaver would go to the toilet after the speech (where she just happened to be the only one using it at that time) and why was there no explanation as to why she had police escort? 2) It was utterly predictable - from the very beginning - that both Mulroney and Weaver's gay assistant would be dead by the end of the film, 3) The mass murderer is once again a walking movie clich√© he knows everything anyone will do at any given time anyplace; he is not only a scientist, he is also a top computer expert, a top breaking-into-houses expert (with full Pink Panther gear), a top actor, a top murderer, knows all there is to know about equipment of any kind, and, of course, he knows all about the infamous mass murderers that he copies - where did he find the time to learn all this? He'd have to be at least 200 years old to know all this. A team of twenty people would be needed to carry out all that he did to such fine, perfect detail. The bad guy is a genius - fine; however, that shouldn't make him a god. But in this silly film he is no less than that, 4) When Hunter puts a bullet through him at the end, does he drop to the floor? No he just stands there, slowly turns around and grins (not again!). Excuse me? The guy's been shot at close range he should fall to the ground, possibly showing some pain, 5) The actor playing the villain is far too weak to be taking on a role of this kind; his pitiful imitations of Jack Nicholson and co. are irritating (I'm mostly referring to his cartoon-like grin, which tortures the poor viewer to no end - and not because he is an insane killer, but because it's bad acting). Kevin Spacey did wonders with his similar character in Seven (sure, he was also directed by a top director), 6) Hunter shoots the Chinese, than the Chinese shoots Mulroney an unnecessary (and unconvincingly directed) twist that takes Mulroney out of the (main) story through a meaningless sub-sub-plot, or was Amiel (who the hell is this guy?) trying to involve us into the uninteresting sub-plot concerning Hunter's ex-boyfriend? I am talking about the scene coming soon after Mulroney's death when Patton does the crying bit (yes, the crying bit when I wasn't sure if he was faking it or if he meant it - bad direction should have been obvious), 7) Are we really supposed to swallow the premise concerning Connick, Jr. giving orders to his disciples while in jail? 8) The scene in which Weaver looks through the keyhole and sees two cops only to find out she's been duped is possibly the dumbest scene in the film (and competition is tough in this department), 9) the feminism and some heavy PC, at the beginning, were irritating, 10) Hunter's boss tells her to stay away from Weaver; another movie clich√©, of the main cop's boss hindering the investigation through sheer illogicality, and so on...I'll say it again, although I've said it a million times I can tolerate a certain amount of clich√©s and absurdities, but when the fine line between acceptable nonsense and unacceptable nonsense gets crossed, that's when I start to spew poison at a movie.As amazing as it sounds - considering how much I already spat at it - the film has some plus points; the scene in which the main villain sends Weaver a visual message through the Internet is quite effective; the dialogues are generally okay and the same goes for &#150; some of - the acting. The film's first half is quite good and very interesting, but at a certain point the uninspired stupidity of the director and the writer takes over and from then on there was only total disbelief am I really watching something THIS dumb? is this level of idiocy possible in a film?

That would have been a nice, nasty touch and would have been mush more believable than her stabbing his upper thigh (funny, I don't remember McNamara limping after that) . Also, we could have dispensed with that unbelievable scene of Hunter rescuing Weaver after Hunter has been shot twice in the chest at close range with a 9mm.`Copycat' is not quite as stupid or badly acted as `Striking Distance,' but it's not a whole lot better either.

Notably, of Just Cause (before you all close your browsers indignantly - I acknowledge that Copycat is a much more intelligent, and better thriller), of Silence of the Lambs, and even a bit of The Witness. All of the above have (or, in case of Just Cause would like to have had), tightly written, so- called sophisticated plots full of twists and suspense with very clear structures, which have a bit of everything - in this case, oh so brave and supercool protagonists who are all so a bit quirky and human (agoraphobia - how endearing..), a touch of romance (for all of those cute cops out there who are turned on by panic attacks!), a bit of tragedy which our strong female protagonists take like men, and even a cute gay guy who lives with our quirky professor Helen - to show us she is liberal-minded as well smart and sexy. What's troubling about these movies are their subtexts - in copycat, we have quite a few of these. For example, shoot to kill. Our cool female cop is perfect, but she has one problem - she still has that weak, womanly quality; too much capacity for empathy. But worry not, she learns in the end, and shoots the villain to death, thus not only neutralizing him, but also denying him the glory he wanted so much in his lifetime. Another subtext - death-sentenced prisoners are being kept alive too long. As Daryl-Lee kindly bothers to inform us, he has sufficient time till his appeals run out to cause no small amount of damage, regardless of the fact that he is imprisoned. Perhaps the most troubling subtext, that prevails in all movies of this kind, is that the protagonists' worst fears are always realized. Now, I do know this a thriller, but think about the plot for a bit - not every thriller delivers these kinds of messages. Agoraphobic, paranoid Helen is troubled by nightmares when she is in fact safely at home in bed, and yet her nightmare comes true to the last detail. It is telling, in my opinion, that Helen's fears are psychiatric, of the most irrational kind; and yet they are realized. It is not for no reason that America is called by many a paranoid nation.So what does all this mean, in the critical sense? That besides being banal, uninteresting and manipulative, Copycat is also a troubling indicator of how America has turned even artists into Yes men, and how industrialized art truly has become - compromising not only quality, but also freedom of thought.

Audrey Hepburn had to be blind but Sigourney Weaver is agoraphobic. Someone seems to be shot dead but comes back to life. There is the murderer's mother who might have belonged to Lawrence Harvey in The Manchurian Candidate or Norman Bates in Psycho. (As in the two earlier examples, this murderer finally kills her.) There is one exploding fireball. Two slow motion deaths. One innocent companionable housekeeper who is gay and, we can tell, dead meat from the start. (No car chases.) Weaver, in an attempt to defend herself, grabs a shard of broken glass and shoves it with her bare hand into the heavy's thigh. Just as Dirty Harry did, only he used a knife. If you grab a piece of broken glass and jam it against someone's body and it penetrates the other's body while leaving your hand unscathed, doesn't this violate one of Newton's laws? At least in The Stepfather, Jill Schoelen had the good sense to wrap a towel around the glass. Using your bare hand is a little like the scene in which the hero disables the villain by bumping heads with him. These movies do not operate in a universe governed by Newtonian laws. Here, to paraphrase Einstein, the director plays dice with the universe. A villain substitutes his own living body for that of a dead cop. This has been described as an homage to Silence of the Lambs. Okay.Then this entire movie is an amalgam of homages. By 1995 the serial killer business had been done to death, so to speak. We had serial killers following patterns derived from Alice in Wonderland, or The Seven Deadly Sins, or pentagrams, or the list of amino acids, or the Chinese zodiac, or the number of times Gatsby uses the expression Old Sport, or the arrangement of heavy metals on Mendeljev's table, and others I forget. Here they solved the problem of inventing a new pattern by combining a lot of old ones taken from real serial murders. The heavy imitates one after another, first the Boston strangler, then the Hillside Stranglers, and so on.Sigourney Weaver and Holly Hunter, as the SFPD Inspector, are two women with thin lips. They play off each other rather well. Dermot Mulroney, with his puppy dog eyes, fails to convince me that he's more than a novice actor. MacNamara is the crazed but brilliant villain. All serial killers are brilliant. They play chess, are computer experts, raise orchids, and know origami inside and out. MacNamara is kind of blandly handsome in a clean-cut way but it's impossible to tell whether he can act or not. The best performance, maybe, is from Will Patton who simply can't help smiling even as he provokes a fight by insulting a rival. Will is also the only character who is given any development in the film, in that he loses that abrasive edge and turns into a weeping willow in a scene so unbelievable and unanticipated that no other living human being could pull it off.The score features Gabriel Faure's Opus 48, In Paradisium. A splendid piece of music that has functioned as a love theme in at least one other film. I hope it isn't overused like Strauss's Thus Spake Zarathustra, Paschelbel's Canon, Puccini's Nessun Dorma from Turandot, Delibes' Lakme, or Ludwig Van's ever-popular Ninth symphony -- but only the majestic chorus. They all deserve better fates than serving as the background for a toothpaste commercial.I kind of like this movie. I watch it once in a while. I enjoy watching the clich√©s turning up one after another, like the serial killer's victims. I also enjoy visiting Disneyland and going on the Pirates of the Caribbean ride once in a while too. I think maybe The Haunted House is my favorite. And the parade at the end of the evening, with fireworks and Mickey Mouse. They're all reliable, you know?

Both films were made in the same year, and follow similar story lines about serial killers. However, where-as in Seven, you have a film that's so dark and depressing that you're drawn in, and the killings, although not witnessed, can actually make you physically sick. The killer too makes the film brilliant, his character is so twisted and seemingly evil but you can do nothing but hate him. However, in the film, you have what is essentially Seven for those with weak stomachs. The atmosphere is certainly not there, the killings while although horrible in real life do not give the same effect as those in Seven (check out the crimes committed against those accused of Lust and Sloth in Seven and you'll agree!). Here you have a killer who wouldn't look out of place in a teen comedy, and another, locked-up killer who's like something out of the Beverly Hill Billies. The music's no where near as horrifying as that of Seven's, and music plays a great part in establishing the atmosphere in these films. There's also never clever plot twists, and aside from a few interesting moments such as seeing the killer in the police station at the beginning standing around, and says hello to a cop, there's nothing for your mind to play around with, unlike the almost poetically structured ending to Seven, that will leave you confused for a while until everything clicks in your mind. I'm not saying it's a bad film, it's quite enjoyable, but I must say that in comparison to Seven, Copycat's no where near as good, and in all due respects you should see Seven instead!

Did USA cut out all the scary parts?I'm not a Holly Hunter fan because she is never believable but I stayed with it because she wasn't too obnoxious and I like Sigourney Weaver's work (sometimes). This particular movie, though, seemed terribly fake. Weaver did justice to the role of an agoraphobic; however, she could not muster even one real tear and all those dry sniffles (when she was supposed to be weeping) were nothing but silly. The way the scenes are set up in the movie, you always know what's coming before it jumps out of the shadows. There's no opportunity to be scared or surprised or on the edge of your seat with anticipation. From the very beginning when she first uses the restroom, the security guard goes in ahead of her to check that it's safe, and you see a pair of legs in high heels behind one locked door and the guard says oh, excuse me. No response. Well duh, you know IMMEDIATELY that something bad is going to happen. It's that way all the way through the movie. Where is the suspense?I disagree that it takes you inside the mind of a serial killer. What I saw was that he had no originality of thought and was a boring, unimaginative little boy who could only copy the work of others... and others who had ALL been captured, no less, because their murder plan wasn't smart enough to elude the law! Where is the genius in that?There was also too much unlikelihood. A doctor who lives in utter fear and panic... yet houses in an apartment so huge and easily accessible that a wacko killer can slip in unnoticed, not once, not twice, but three times? And then, when she looks through the peephole and sees two supposed cops, one with his back to her, she doesn't ask to see ID, just starts talking to them as she casually opens the door? An agoraphobic woman does not do that. She checks, re- checks, re-re-checks, and always fears the unexpected, the thing she didn't guard against.
