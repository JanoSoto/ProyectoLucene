Less than 5/10??? It ain't Shakespeare, but it's better than that.This movie was unpretentious and fun. You could clearly see that everyone involved in this project was having a good time.Tank Girl is a campy comic-book splashed up on your screen. The folks who take it too seriously should lighten up. It was well written (as camp) and I really enjoyed all of the characters. It's the ultimate In your face movie. The feminist subtext was interesting. I didn't notice it right off, I was too busy enjoying the ride. But if you look at all of the characters, it's the women who are strong, and all of the male characters are either villains or are defective in some way (1/2 human Rippers).It was (and is) one of my favourite flicks and I can be very critical of badly done movies.

It's very well done for 1995, the dialogue is well-scripted for the intent of the movie, and the funny stuff is actually funny. Some of the action scenes are a bit campy - but then again, they're *supposed* to be that way in this kind of movie. In addition, I thought the acting was excellent, and that Lori Petty (who played Kit in A League of Our Own) Malcolm McDowell (practically legendary) and Naomi Watts were excellent choices for their characters, as were the rest of the supporting cast. Lori Petty hasn't been in anything huge since this movie, which is truly a pity as she is an excellent and versatile actress. Look for some interesting supporting actors, including Ice-T, Iggy Pop, and James Hong.Listen to the comedic dialogue carefully - most of the punchlines are funny on several levels, which I found most refreshing, and you'll encounter a lot of funny double-entendre.Don't look for a bunch of CGI computer effects in this movie. However, well-designed and imaginative props and sets give a good feeling of authenticity to the scenes, and the visual and special effects are excellent.Don't bother critiquing little details and spurious claptrap like that with this movie - it sets out to be a comic-book-style fun action-adventure and accomplishes that goal magnificently. (The funniest thing is that the plot precept of a mega-corporation in control of the world's water supply is becoming more and more of a plausible idea and leads one to think of a possible metaphoric reference to the world oil situation) This movie might have been rated R at the time for adult situations & violence (and a little nudity), but I didn't notice a whole lot of foul language, and I didn't really see much in the movie that wouldn't be put on broadcast TV today.This movie has everything - good acting, evil villains, cute heroines, mutants, cool vehicles, explosions, big sets, a huge supporting cast, hilarious humor, great stunts, and even a classic musical number with a full chorus line! (Let's Do It by Cole Porter) It even pokes fun at beat poetry. All-in-all, well worth seeing.If you like stuff like The Wizard of Speed and Time, Flash Gordon, Johnny Mnemonic, Space Truckers, Ice Pirates, or Yellowbeard then you'll definitely love this movie. Even if you don't, see this movie anyway - it may change your mind about this genre.From personal experience Chicks dig this flick. Get the popcorn & enjoy.

And while it's a really sharp and cool attitude, the movie might have soared if instead of merely being an attitude it had been a personality.  Then, arising from this Tank Girl personality, a whole range of interesting emotions could have been emerged, adding variety and a chance for excitement to build instead of plateauing in the first few minutes.  Because even in a romp of a pic, you still need to care about the characters.  And it's a whole bunch easier to care about a person than it is to care about an attitude.Still, I had good fun watching this movie.  The Feeling a little inadequate? scene is a minor classic.  And by chance I happened to watch this movie the same day I saw Mulholland Dr. and I still have a very difficult time recognizing that Naomi Watts is the same person in both films.  She's excellent in both, but so very different.  Ice-T, Jeff Kober, and Reg E. Cathey do a surprisingly effective job of creating characters from underneath their Ripper make-up... they're so good that one of the best parts of Tank Girl is just watching and listening to them.This isn't a movie to go into with high expectations.  Read all the negative comments, take them to heart, and then watch the movie anyway.  It will make Tank Girl a pleasant surprise.

It's 2033--Earth had been hit by a giant comet 11 years before. It wiped out most of civilization and (somehow) caused it never to rain again. Water is in very short supply and evil Kesslee (Malcolm McDowell) is hoarding it all and controlling it. He's attacked by the Rippers--a gang of mutant man-animals (don't ask). He also attacks Rebecca (Lori Petty) and destroys most of her friends. She vows revenge. That's (sort of) the plot.The original comic book was great. Tons of sex, nudity, violence, strong aggressive women and a stubborn refusal to take itself seriously. The movie tries to recreate that--and it succeeds! The nudity is gone and sex and the violence were toned down but the strong female characters remain. It all starts out with a great opening song and cartoon images from the comic book shoved in your face. Then Rebecca orders her boyfriend Richard (Brian Wimmer) to strip at gunpoint! Then it starts to get strange... There is a plot but the story keeps taking detours with STRANGE (but fun) dialogue, a loud aggressive alternative soundtrack, animated sequences and even a show stopping song and dance number! This all somehow fits together and the movie never stops moving. Set designs are incredible--filled to the brim with pop culture. Director Rachel Talalay deserves credit for keeping this all together.The acting is great--McDowell goes over the top (enjoyably), Naomi Watts is fun as Jet Girl and Petty is just beyond belief as Tank Girl. Loud, aggressive, snapping off one-liners left and right and a STRONG female character who never stops fighting. Just great all the way! United Artists had no idea how to market this picture (it IS difficult) so it bombed but it acquired a cult following. This isn't for everybody (a lot of critics hated it) but I loved it. A 10.Best exchange Tank Girl asks the madam of a whorehouse to sing. The madam asks, What song? Tank Girl responds, Let's Do It by Cole Porter, 1929. The madam I HATE that song.

Even at 6$ it was too expensive. I thought there might be some campy fun in it, a so bad it becomes good vibe perhaps, I was wrong. I had watched it once long ago and didn't remember any of it. Now I know why. I was bored out of my mind and was looking for distractions to do something else. I'm all for grrrrl power, punk attitude and absurd humor but Tank Girl does not work on any front. The script is bad, you don't care about the characters and the humor is mostly lame except for a few amusing one-liners. The special effects or locations are poor or often replaced by comic panels or animations that are just too jarring compared to the live-action. It's like they didn't have the money to shoot the cool stuff and so resorted to drawings, however cool they might be (an uncensored animated feature would be way better for Tank Girl now that I think about it). The action scenes were cheesy but not in a fun b-movie way. The tank itself was far from impressive or dynamic although it was interestingly decorated. As a matter of fact, the best action scenes involving the tank were in animation. It does have some interesting songs by known artists such as Bjork, Hole and Portishead but instead of improving the atmosphere, they just don't fit most of the time. Once they even break into a ludicrous song and dance number that was just senseless and horrible. I think that's when I totally tuned out. I suppose Tank Girl, played by Lori Petty, looks the trashy punkette part but beyond her attitude and sometimes barely amusing retorts, is more two-dimensional and superficial than the worst comic book characters. Jet, played by Naomi Watts, is probably the only saving grace of the film and it's amazing how such a good actress was involved in this mess. Malcolm McDowell wasn't too bad playing his usual villain role. It might be a cult movie for some but please consider that it's really different from the original independent comics and the original creators were disappointed with the movie themselves (check out the entry for Tank Girl on Wikipedia).

Apart from some of the production design (namely TG's tank and Jet Girl's plane) the movie bears hardly any relation at all to its source material. Rather than throw a shedload of cash at making humans up to look like unconvincing kangaroo mutants, the producers should have employed a group of Korean animators and made a feature-length cartoon. No-one would have had a problem with a talking kangaroo if he was animated! Not content with deciding to restrict the imaginative depth of Tank girl with a live-action rendition, the producers cocked things up even more by removing any vestige of what made the eponymous anti-heroine such an attractive character in the first place. The comic book Tank Girl is an almost entirely selfish and amoral being who only ends up doing good by accident. The movie Tank Girl was no more than an Americanised female version of Mad Max, who arrived on the Post-Apocalyptic Movie Scene approximately 10 years too late to cash in. Put simply, Tank Girl is another of Hollywood's missed opportunities.

I blundered into a showing of Tank Girl during its short-lived (and basically disastrous) release and found it memorable for its comic page scene transitions (borrowed from television's Wonder Woman) and its spoof of the action/adventure movie genre. Unfortunately the animation just makes you wish that the whole thing was animation while the moronic nature of all the live action scenes makes you question whether spoofing the genre was by design or by accident.Ten years later it has some retrospective interest relative to the disparate career directions of Lori Petty and Naomi Watts. It is simply impossible to make Petty sexy; no matter how glamed-up, erotically posed, or provocatively scripted. Conversely it is impossible for Watts to not be sexy, no matter how hard they try to detune, grime-up, and disguise her.Tank Girl poses the question, why do so many people dislike it, both now and at the time of its release ten years ago? Lori Petty is the most obvious answer. Petty's basic personality embodies the most irritating qualities of Lucille Ball with none of Lucy's humor and charm. She is irritating even in her low-key roles (A League of Their Own). Apparently she was cast as Tank Girl for exactly that quality and Director Rachel Talaly managed to bring her full irritating potential to the screen. But the producers forgot to connect the dots before they spent $25 Million on production, irritating is sometimes good in supporting roles (insert Stiffer here) but not as the main character.About two thirds of the way into the story Petty and Watts fall into the hands of a group of genetically engineered fellows called The Rippers. At first this appears to be going in the direction of Dark Angel meets Captain Kangaroo. But Talaly switches direction a bit and ends up with a post-apocalyptic version of Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs. For a few minutes the movie is actually a lot of fun. Then it is time to get back to the basic story, which by this time everyone (viewers, director, cast, and editor) has pretty much forgotten. This does not pose the post-production problems it does in other movies because Talaly seems committed to insuring that no element of suspense is present to distract you from Petty's irritating performance.The Tank Girl comic strip embodied a freewheeling anti-authoritarian anarchism, with some feminist and even lesbian themes. Although Talaly faithfully captures a small amount of this spirit she fumbles big time with the basic storytelling (insert no suspense). Which is hardly a revelation given her other directorial attempts (including Freddy's Dead The Final Nightmare and Ghost in the Machine-arguably even worse than Tank Girl). If she actually liked the comic strip she should have yielded control to a competent director or at least someone with a basic talent for directing actors and for making feature films.

I have never read any of these comic books, so I don't know how true the film is- but from what I mostly heard and read, it's not- but who cares it looked like it would be a fun viewing.After watching this mess I don't know why? As I just couldn't bear to fully bag it out and that's why I gave it 5. I know it was trash- but still I found it visually good and kinda amusing&#133; in a stupid way.The script is awfully bad, the performances were mostly ludicrous and direction was quite tragic, as the scenes just seem to limp along without any panache. Though the film makes up for it with its upbeat soundtrack that was coordinated by Courtney Love and featuring the likes of Bjork, Hole, Iggy Pop, Bush and Veruca Salt, while it's vibrantly rich and bizarre comic backdrop is quite eye-catching, even though the sets do look kind of cheap. The added comic cartoon interludes throughout the film I found to be more satisfying at times than the actual live scenes, making you think it would have probably been better if they stuck to a cartoon version.The performances I had mix feelings about. Lori Petty as Tank Girl was fair and brings a chirpy attitude- but the humour at times was a bit stale, especially some of her cringe-worthy one-liners and from what I grasp about the character she was playing she totally looked the part but was no where near what she acts like in the comic series. Namoi Watts as Jet Girl I thought was the standout, which isn't saying much- but she was far subtle and innocently sweet and that worked for me. Malcolm McDowell wasn't too bad, as he really hams it up as the villain Kesslee and Ice-T as a Ripper is unrecognisable and fairly irritating- but anyway what's new? The direction was really muddled, mainly flashier- but no substance in the scenes to make it stand out from the average Sci-fi film and the pace of the film was a bit patchy in spots, such as the flat musical scene and when Tank and Jet girl were hanging out with the rippers at their base. The Ripper designs were reasonably good by Stan Winston, with each with their own personality and distinguishing features- but that didn't make them likable.While the plot, if there was one was just basically a been there done that feel and lack any sort of detail and urgency. I thought the story started out alright and was quite lively but it kind of lost steam halfway through and especially when the annoying Rippers took centre stage. There are some interesting elements thrown into the mix, like the device that sucks water out of people.For me it's one of those films that it's so bad, it's good entertainment. So it breaks even for me.

Speaking of A Clockwork Orange, Alex (Aka Malcolm Mcdowell is in the film and he needs to escape before it's too late. The film feels so forced and contrived as well. I recall there was a Dance number out of nowhere. Why was it there? What point did it have? It in no way moved the plot forward. That's basically this film, a collection of plot points bridged together by pointless filler. Stay far away.

He seems doomed to play villains in sci fi movies that feature such tiresome protagonists that you end up rooting for him.  This is another in the series of big old messes to which he brings a much needed touch of class.Nobody in this film (the weary veteran McDowell apart) seems to know what their character is supposed to be.  There are few actual conversations, mostly confused monologues delivered to empty space; perhaps they're all too embarrased to make eye contact.  There's too much budget to allow the raw charm of Repo Man, but not enough to make the FX anything other than embarrasing.  Is the titular tank a tardis?  Why is it the size of a winnebago inside, and is it a T-72, an M-47 or an M4?  Why do bullets strike sparks when they hit sand?  Everything about this film is desultory and barely adequate, and every opportunity to take a suprising direction or even provide a decent disjoint is missed.  It's the slackness of indie filmmaking blended with the no-risk anodyness of Hollywood.The biggest flaw is Petty.  She switches from concussed to hyperactive more or less at random, and - while she does have a decent big eyed blank look going - she's simply too old to play a part that requires an almost unachievably idealised fantasy pubescent.  Tank Girl needs the insane toothy over-confidence of youth, not the over-cosmetic and over-calculated maturity that Petty displays. She actually does manage to deliver some decently amusing one liners, but most of the time she falls slightly short of being genuinely winning.I would have given this a full 4/10 for the (initial) geek chic of Jet Girl, and for the unapologetic premise that the only thing not in short supply in this post apocalyptic world are cosmetics and ammo.  However, it gets dinged one because of the comic cutscenes.  Not because they're bad, but because they're the BEST thing in this mess that just reminds us there's a fair amount of flair and verve here, being suppressed under the stifling blanket of no-risk filmmaking.  And then there's the matter of the Endearing Child Hostage.  I know it's a genre convention, but it's supremely annoying and utterly, bone chillingly irrelevant and unnecessary.  Then there's the slight problem that towards the end, Jet Girl discovers lipstick and suddenly seems not to need her glasses.  That's so teen movie that it's not even funny.  So a full 1 out of 10, then.  For shame, for shame.

I had no idea what the movie was about, although I did know that Lori Petty and Malcolm McDowell were in it. i also knew that it wasn't exactly a masterpiece of a film, either, so I went home, started watching, and just tried to have a little fun and enjoy myself.And, for a while, I did. The introduction was cool, the characters were funny, and it was actually interesting to watch. Lori Petty totally rocked as Tank Girl---although I heard that Tank Girl's character in the comic book was a lot more intense. Her sidekick, Jet Girl, was just as awesome. They should have had a lot more scenes with Malcolm McDowell, though, especially between him and Tank Girl. Those were some of the best parts. You can't help but love all the campy humor. But sometime after Tank and Jet hook up with the Rippers, or whatever theyr'e called, the movie just seems to go downhill. Take out the Raiders-of-the-Lost-Ark-style truck sequence with Tank, and the entire middle is pretty boring. The Rippers--I mean, okay, they're half men, half kangaroos. Why not at least get mutated into something useful, like, half man, half shark or bear or cheetah or something? Ice-T was just plain annoying, as was Tank Girl's kangaroo man boyfriend, Booga. The beatnik poetry thing was cool, but the dancing thing and everything else were so stupid they weren't even funny. The ending makes up for it a bit. Even the Rippers had some funny moments (Count Chocula--he's the guy on the laundry detergent box, right?). Tank Girl eventually saves the world in the end, Jet Girl gets revenge on her boyfriend from Water and Power, and the world has water again. Yay! Like I said, though, they should have had more scenes of McDowell and the bad guys. It's great to watch him ham it up as the evil villain (as always).So, if you're looking for senseless fun and recklessness with no point or reason, watch Tank Girl. It may not be Lawrence of Arabia or Gone With the Wind, but it's a lot better than SOME of the movies I've seen. Oh, yeah, and don't pay over $1.50 to rent it.

If you want to watch something fun and full of attitude, something campy and endearing, this is for you. Though there are many sociological parallels to times of unrest and change, and a lot of interesting social and political undertones (like feminism, corporate greed, etc), if you're looking for something serious or something without plot holes, inconsistencies, and makes sense, give this a pass. This movie doesn't care to maintain the 4th wall and it doesn't care to follow logic, science, or even to make sense in all its details, but it is full of humor, great campy acting, and an I don't give a damn attitude that tugs at my rebellious heart strings.

Like any good comic movie, it uses the comic book for inspiration and finds it's own way.

But it seemed like I was the only one who did; the reviews in the paper trashed it, my friends hated it, and it was out of the theater before most folks ever got a chance to see it. Now it seems to be having something of a renaissance on video. Its reputation is growing, but there is still an awful lot of silly hatred for this film out there, and I think folks are really being unreasonable about it. Okay, so this is a silly movie. So what? It was supposed to be. It's just an action flick. Check out the page for Die Hard, for example. That film rates an 8.0, while this poor movie is stuck at 4.6. Why? Sure, Die Hard had better effects; it had a slightly larger budget, too. But Tank Girl is funnier, smarter (no, really, I mean it) and has far more interesting characters. Lori Petty is sexy and mad-funny. Neither film is high art but this one is simply more enjoyable (and I like both), so why the huge difference in ratings? It seems like the expectations for this film were higher than they should have been, maybe because the feminist theme (good women kicking evil men's butts) misled people into expecting a work of serious political or social intent. But if anyone thought that, they obviously knew nothing about the film or the story coming into it. In the first place, the movie was based on a COMIC BOOK, for goodness' sake. For that matter, the comic in question was basically a feminized and humorized version of The Road Warrior, not all that serious a motion picture in itself. Also, the casting of Malcolm McDowell as the villain should have provided a clue; he's the most reliable bad guy in Hollywood, because you always know exactly the character you're going to get out of him. The trailer, with all the crazy outfits, ridiculous kangaroo costumes, and zany one-liners shouldn't have misled anyone. Plus, why on Earth would expect Citizen Kane from a film called Tank Girl in the first place? This movie is exactly what you want for kicking back and enjoying an evening a fast-paced, engaging bit of semi-sci-fi which, surprisingly, really does achieve a few genuinely beautiful moments, especially the dust-shower scene (to Portishead's Roads). Ignore all the cynics. This film is a blast. It's pure entertainment with a good cast and zany, silly story&#133;it's the closest you'll ever get to a live-action Bugs Bunny cartoon.

This is unforgivable in any movie which asks that little bit more from the audience to suspend disbelief, like one set in a post apocalyptic Australia ruled by the iron fist of a mega corporation in a fascistic regime. The creators probably thought the silly tone would make the audience overlook this lack of story building but as a result the movie ultimately falls short of the premise and fails to capitalize on the aforementioned positive aspects.As a final note, this movie is not cyberpunk.

The film is based on a popular comic book series with comic book illustrations incorporated well into the action; the sets and costumes are also delightfully imaginative and same goes for a water bottle weapon that sucks all liquid out of a person. The dialogue is surprisingly witty too with our heroine frequently giving lip in the face of adversity. Energetic as Lori Petty is in the lead role though and memorable though her lines may be, she nevertheless comes off as rather obnoxious overall. She does not have much respect for anyone, regardless of whether they are her adversities or not, and she comes off especially abrasive by contrast to her sidekick, played in an unusually dowdy manner by a young Naomi Watts. As a narrative, the film only really ever half-succeeds too. It all starts off rather promising with the water shortage concept and the offbeat notion that a hardly muscular girl could be humanity's greatest hope, but everything turns into chaotic action towards the end and interesting as the mutant kangaroo characters are, they come off as deserving of a film of their own rather than being written off as merely genetic engineering gone awry. It is easy to see why such a haphazard film as this drew negative reviews upon initial release. No, it is not nearly that bad, but whether the film's scattered virtues amount to a positive experience is likely to vary per viewer.

It soars on the same hyperactive plane as Saturday morning cartoons, but with a delicious R-rated bite, and a spunky, out of this world lead performance from Lori Petty. It captures the breakneck pace of the comic it's based on, and indeed moves along at the speed of a hummingbird on Ritalin, rarely pausing for air. The manic colours pop off the screen, the performances leap out at you like delirious mascots on a cereal box, and the vibe is go, go go for 90 glorious minutes straight, with a thumping soundtrack to keep the energy up. Lori Petty is a sexy, ADD addled wonder as the titular heroine, a desert dwelling, adorable wiseass who finds her compound and safe haven overrun with goons of the monstrous 'Water & Power' corporation, run by the sadistic megalomaniac Kesslee (Malcolm McDowell). McDowell is no stranger to playing evil bigwig sons of bitches, and this one is the goddamn prototype. He leers, recites poetry, walks barefoot on broken glass with an sweetly angelic grin, and terrorizes basically everything that moves in a perfect performance of untold, ghoulish madness. Tank Girl finds herself at odds with the corporation, and swept up in a revolt against them, aided by shy, bi curious Jet Girl (Naomi Watts, who reportedly has bad mouthed this flick in interviews these days, now that she has a high horse to sit on. Don't listen to a word). She also finds allies in mysterious desert dwellin creatures who, get this, turn out to be genetic hybrids between humans and kangaroos, bred for war. The practical effects are wondrous, letting the actors shine through the masks. Jeff Kober is a sheepish joy as the dumb one, Booga. Ice T dials up the crankiness, and third who is the reincarnation of Jack Kerouac.

The intention was clearly to make Rebecca a lovable, quirky, anarchic, spunky, funny, sexy, alternative anti-heroine with attitude, someone with whom everyone, regardless of their sex, could fall for. Petty's grating grrl-power performance ensures that the opposite rings true she is shrill, obnoxious and tiresome in the extreme.Unfortunately, Petty's painful performance isn't the only problem with Tank Girl. Director Rachel Talalay's attempts at capturing the rebellious spirit of the comic fall flat on their face. With seemingly no understanding of what does and does not work, Talalay chucks everything onto the screen no matter how cringe-worthy, including what could qualify as the most awkward song and dance number in the history of cinema. Meanwhile, Malcolm MacDowell and Ice-T chalk up another bomb on their respective filmographies and make-up legend Stan Winston tries but fails to make human kangaroos not look as stupid as they sound.A cool alternative soundtrack adds some much needed oomph to proceedings, there are some surprisingly slick scenes of animation (that suggest that the whole thing would have worked far better as a feature length animated movie) and Naomi Watts is likable as Rebecca's nerdy side-kick Jet Girl (the actress looking great with dark hair), but it's nowhere near enough to prevent this film from being a tedious, virtually unwatchable mess.

You should walk into the theater with zero expectations, leaving with an unbiased impression instead of a smirk. But yesterday, I did something most movie critics should not do I went to hate-watch Insurgent with my bubbly teenage sister who was most definitely not hate-watching the film. I won't go into details (to be fair, I just posted my review of Insurgent only yesterday), but what I will admit is that I left the cinema with a strong feeling of meh, if that's even a feeling (the youths act like it is these days). It's a blockbuster for the teen crowd, a B-version of The Hunger Games. Its biggest crime is not being meh; its biggest crime is being so devoid of any kind of personality.In 2015, well-crafted action scenes and statuesque leads are not enough &#x97; they might have been in 1999, but we can no longer party like its 1999, because 1999 was, well, 16 years ago. Nowadays, all we can depend on is &#x85; spunk. It's a shame that a blockbuster as lame-brained as Insurgent is going to make so much money; what does it really have to offer? Which finally brings me to Tank Girl, the 1995 would-be blockbuster that is better known today as being the film that lost $21 million dollars at the box-office, the film that should have made a Lori Petty a star but didn't, the film that Naomi Watts co-starred in before she became the it girl from Mulholland Dr., the film that now resides in the throes of two golden words cult classic. I was reminded of the film during, yes, Insurgent, where Watts makes an appearance as the blandly handsome male lead's mother. In the theater, surrounded by giggling teenage girls, I found myself pondering about that money-losing cult classic I had known about but never watched for years.But enough for backstories; mine, most likely, isn't as interesting as I'd like it to be. I guess the point I'm trying to make is that it's so unfair that Tank Girl, which is exploding with spunk and personality, is confined to the sad remarkability of a cult film, whereas Insurgent, which is about as interesting as your sad Uncle Alvarez, is going to make millions upon millions of dollars. (Cut to me going outside during this dark, rainy night, falling onto my knees, and yelling NOOOOOOOO! into the air like no one's watching.) It comes down to this please, please don't see Insurgent. See the breakneck speeded, freakish, abstract, one-liner infused saunter of Tank Girl. It won't make you smarter, and it certainly won't change your life, but I'll be damned if it doesn't enliven your spirits with its out- and-proud weirdness.The year is 2033. 11 years earlier, a comet hit the Earth with devastating results, causing an endless drought that has turned most of the world into a parched desert. Little of the population remains; most work for, or head, the scheming Water & Power corporation, who use their massive authority to act as a sort of new, evil government. Their latest advancement? They now have the capability to purify blood into water, which is totally reasonable and not at all disgusting. A few people have escaped the clutches of the nefarious executives, however. Among them are Rebecca Buck, aka Tank Girl (Petty). She prides herself in her unwavering wildness she's overtly sexual, loud, gross, and fearless, deadly with a gun and tough-talking in her words. Unlike the Trises and Katnisses of today, she is blatantly ballsy. She doesn't regret her actions, and she doesn't care what people think of her. When her commune is destroyed by W & P, though, she is kidnapped by their hilariously ghoulish leader (Malcolm McDowell), who sees promise in Tank Girl's defiant attitude but is threatened by it, throwing her into slave work. But of course, she escapes, with a new friend in tow (Naomi Watts). Of course, she embarks on a crazy adventure. Of course, she ends up winning the mini-battle against the company. But who cares about predictability when it's all wrapped up in a tie-dyed package of kookiness?Assembling itself in a sphere of scale-models, campy set-pieces, outlandish prosthetic makeup, animated interludes, and a soundtrack and tone that suggests it all was funded by classic era MTV, Tank Girl swirls in a blender of batshit energy, sometimes successfully and sometimes not. I guess it wants to be too many things at once funny, sexy, cute, action-packed, and most clearly, fun, for lack of a better term. It isn't great at everything it attempts, but what Tank Girl never fails at is being downright amusing. Petty's tough broad façade is consistently charming; her presence is so essential that her hit-or-miss (but mostly miss) career can be blamed for this career-defining portrayal. Personally, I think she's absolutely fantastic, but others might not be so sure (she's so delightfully manic).What makes the film work is how well it recognizes the bombastic insanity of its source. The comics, from what I've seen, are eye-popping creations of exaggerated punkiness, having all the swagger of a 15-year- old brat's daydreams. That tonal emphasis is brought into Tank Girl without any misgivings, and that's why it's so much better than (here we go again) Insurgent. Insurgent is so afraid to fail that it doesn't even try to be anything other than a fill-in-the-blank dystopian-set action- romance. Tank Girl can fall flat on its face once in a while, but at least it has the nerve to do so. It's not perfect, but Netflix streaming is much cheaper than a wasted ten dollars.

Well Petty's heroine loses her sister-like gal, 10 year old Sam, to, and her friends are killed by, McDowell's men when they raid their compound (basically a two story dump with a working greenhouse and water supply siphoned from the ground they currently live). Taken in as a slave for manual labor, McDowell fancies her fighting spirit and wants to break her like some mustang, but Petty proves to be a task he can't seemingly succeed in vanquishing. Soon another mistreated plane mechanic played by a young pre-star Naomi Watts joins forces with Petty, becoming Jet Girl (after she commandeers a jet plane) and Tank Girl (after she commandeers a tank) once they are able to be free thanks to an attack by a group of rebellious rippers, known for explosively and unpredictably raiding W&P plants across the desert. Each time a plant is attacked, McDowell's losing more men and resources to attain all the water he so desires to remain in such power. What McDowell doesn't realize is that these rippers are genetically engineered men-rabbits, an example of military attempts at creating a type of supersoldier. Fun actors in the bunny makeup include Ice-T, Reg E Cathey, Jeff Kober (accustomed to villain scumbag parts, his turn as a dog moved up to human status, an innocuous, child-like member of the rippers, is a nice surprise!), and Scott Coffey. Petty and Watts (who is a nervy, timid sort, awoken to action and eventually gains guts and courage thanks to her time with Petty) make for a neat team, with a lot of girl power mojo working in this film's favor. The comic vignettes really kind of annoyed me because they sort of take me right out of the movie and situations that progress the plot (they are at times inaccurate to what is truly happening or embellishes elaborately something that certainly isn't happening) but with the tone and middle finger approach to conventional storytelling and characterization it seems to fall in line. Petty's throw-caution-to-the-wind performance and character keeps the film quite energetic and off-the-cuff. McDowell's corrupt, megalomaniacal slime is the perfect opposition for the kind of character Petty portrays. The alt rock music, the punk look and attitude, and the emphasis on kaboom is the way to set things right all play a hand in the cult appeal of Tank Girl. The action scenes and the editing are a bit all over the place so the direction isn't exactly a knockout, but Petty is indeed a firecracker that sparkles up the proceedings excitedly. That said, the dialogue isn't exactly peachy keen and there's even a song and dance number to Cole Porter located at a dustbowl brothel (that looks as if it was designed by someone inspired by Gilliam's Brazil) as Petty orchestrates and conducts even though McDowell's W&P army is out to get her. If you are looking for something out of control and bonkers, then this could be right what you need to waste a little time.

All its stupidity aside, there's nothing quite like Tank Girl. It's a mostly terrible film that I inexplicably enjoy and I couldn't in good faith recommend it. Director Rachel Talalay seems to be as disappointed with the film as most viewers are and I could only imagine how nightmarish the shoot was, that full scenes were 'forgotten' to be filmed and in two cases, animation was added to clear that up. Tank Girl does have a go for broke attitude that never relents. Lori Petty plays the role with boundless energy and she's fine, even though a stronger editor would trim her manic behavior into a more shaped performance. It's a bizarre film that really never works, but it's plenty of fun.

But as somebody who never read the comics I decided to take a look and... Although it is crap, for a movie of it's kind it actually isn't that bad.Well the one question you might ask is Why am I giving something like this credit? Well there are a number of reasons. The directing style of using animated interludes and drawings (although I have heard that's accurate to the comics... somehow I don't know) actually adds a nice touch even if there isn't that much point to them. To do this while comic book movies were only just starting to flourish I can imagine was a risk so again I'm giving it credit.I'm also giving it credit because it's a female superhero movie that actually is entertaining from beginning to end. I mean... Yeah it's still the cinematic equivalent of junk food but... Hey! So are most other comic book movies.So I am giving this credit but even with the premise it had I can still see it working a little better. The wise cracks of this movie... aren't wise (Hey that was lame but it's still better than most of the jokes in this movie) and for half the movie you sometimes forget that Tank Girl is going to save Samantha, but then again when you shove MUTANT JAZZ KANGAROOS in this movie it's a little hard to remember it for anything else.So did I like this movie? No. I thought that it could have been a lot better than what it was but then again I am giving it credit for being something fresh and new in the world of comic book movies (I'm not just talking about for the time you REALLY have never seen a comic book movie like this). If this movie was given a better director and writer but still kept the story, this could have been on par with the comic book movies made today.

With the rock music and the flashing comic-book images, I was lured in with the promise of a truly punk-spirited post-apocalypse adventure.Well, the film delivers, in the sense that it's set in a post-apocalyptic world, and there's adventure. This is also a very wacky film, with cartoony comic relief, cheesy action, and a very cheap production value. The good thing about this film is that the main character's attitude is so wild and fun that accentuates the goofy nature of the film, and delivers the punkish vibe I was expecting. Everything else, however, tends to be rather ridiculous. It makes for a weirdly mixed experience overall.This story is pretty basic stuff, lacking in depth or emotion. The plot wanders all over the place, lacking in specific direction. Chances are that you've seen better structure and deeper meaning in other great sci-fi films that bear all the same plot elements and characters. Tank Girl squanders its storytelling potential in favor of just being kooky.This film uses pretty standard photography and editing. Comic book images are cut in at various places. A couple of scenes are animated, and those are probably the coolest parts. Acting is extremely cheesy and over-the-top; Lori Petty uses such cheese to craft an deliciously fun and hip performance, while a very young Naomi Watts plays a perfect square, and Malcolm McDowell does his usual schtick. Writing is pretty simple-minded. This production has sets, props, and costumes that are so cheap-looking, colorful, and clean; the film almost looks like what you'd get if Pee Wee Herman's playhouse survived the apocalypse and went just slightly feral. Music is alright; the score is okay, and a number of good songs are used to give the film a little more oomph to the punk factor.Much like the actual tank in the film, Tank Girl is a cheap-looking, colorful, gaudy, haphazard assortment of random parts and cute decor. It's definitely cheesy, but it is pretty fun that way regardless. I'd say it's perfectly fitting next to other weird, cheap, and cheesy flicks like the Super Mario Bros movie, or Howard the Duck. If those appeal to you, then Tank Girl might be up your alley. Otherwise, move along, nothing to see here.3/5 (Entertainment Good | Story Poor | Film Poor) "},{"Title":"I'm not even sure if the sound track can resurrect this film","Date":"26 July 2013","Score":"","Genre":"Action, Comedy, Sci-Fi","Review":" I am not sure why I even purchased this particular film. Maybe it had something to do with the belief that it may have been a cult classic, but seriously, it is not. I remember some friends watching it and raving about it, but then again those friends have long gone, and I rarely, if ever, see them around. Maybe another group of friends liked this movie, but who they were I really have no memory of because the group of friends that I hung around in later years of my university life really did not seem to watch many movies.Basically this is a post-apocalyptic film set after a comet destroys the Earth and the planet is ruled by a megacorporation known as Water and Power. Basically they control all of the water and have all of the power (as Tank Girl explains at the beginning) but in reality, all this corporation seems to be is one executives and a bunch of soldiers with slaves and prisoners doing all of the other work. Then there are the reavers, some creatures that come out at night, live underground, and cause havoc to the corporation, and finally, there is everybody else, namely those who live out in the desert and attempt to escape the clutches of Water & Power.To me this seems to reflect the nineties struggle between Generation X and the baby boomers, with Generation X wanting to have fun, and not to pay for it, and the Baby Boomers seeking to stifle the limits of that fun. Basically the baby boomers control the means by which Generation X can enjoy themselves, though we should be mindful of the fact that it was the Baby Boomers that led the sexual revolution of the late 60s. However, as one friend pointed out, the protesters of the 60s are the corporate bosses of the 90s. However, even now we see this idea of giving the young much more power than they really know how to use (not that the baby boomers know how to use it either).I guess this film catches the essence of the 90s (not only with the grunge rock sound track). We had come out victorious from the Cold War, and it was still years away from the modern era of the Islamic terrorist and the new McCarthyism that arose under the Bush administration. We see the younger generation, as defined by Tank Girl, moving further away from the traditional roots that many of the baby boomers grew up with, and also rejecting the baby boomer's morality. However we are also seeing the beginning of the rise of the megacorporations, and the tight hold that they have on our lives.This era was also an era dominated by consolidation, as the small businesses disappear to be replaced by the big box outlets outside of town, as is represented by Walmart in America. The multitude of various companies are replaced by one single overarching company, as is seen in Australia where once we had three airline carriers, and now only have one. The same is the case with the supermarkets, which have all come under two major companies, with a collection of independent stores a distant third. Take a look on Google Maps of the various towns in the United States, where main street has all but disappeared to be replaced by shopping malls, big box outlets, and chains upon chains of fast food restaurants. This is the new world that we have entered and are struggling to survive in, in the same way that Tank Girl struggles to survive in a world dominated by Water and Power.As for the film itself, well, it is silly. In fact, it is not amusing or enjoyable silly, it is just silly. For instance, the scene where she is chasing the truck is just simply pathetic, especially where they have one shot of her cooking a barbecue on the top of her tank. To me that was not only a WOF moment, it was a roll my eyes, I can't believe this film, type of moment. As for me, I'm off to see This is the End.

The female characters are sometimes more than one dimensional, but are probably not much fun to hang out with, especially during an apocalypse. Yes, I would want to hang out with Lara Croft during an apocalypse, but there you have it, the two leading roles played by women in action movies, the badass/serious/sexy and the damsel/maybe-smart-but-defenseless/sexy, so at least this movie has value in the fact that there are very few action movies with female leads in this sort of role.And the music, unhhh.....throwback whiplash.

But if you are open minded and say - hey just show me something fun and silly that may not have any reality, then this could be your movie. It also however, does have some R rated sections for both violence and sexiness.I also believe that movies should be rated on what they claim to be. This movie certainly is not Gone with the Wind, but then again, it does not claim to be. It claims to be a silly movie about a comic book heroine that is merely trying to be entertaining - assuming one likes that genre in the first place. To a certain extent, this movie reminded me a bit of a more modern version of Jane Fonda's Barbarella - a movie also made with a sexy most odd female in an odd sci-fi world. If you liked Barbarella or the silly movie Mars Attacks, you might like this one as well.As for me, I rated this movie somewhat high based on that I think it did what it promised to do - be a silly, entertaining comedy.

I noticed before sitting down to watch Tank Girl that it has got a bad reputation for being a Hollywoodised bastardisation of the cult comic. As someone who has a lot of fondness for the comic and as an admirer of Malcolm McDowell, I found Tank Girl neither a good or terrible movie. More the disappointing but sort of watchable neck of the woods.I do give it plaudits for the colourful visuals, the upbeat soundtrack and decent performances from most of the cast. Lori Petty does have some cringe-worthy one-liners but I did find her surprisingly credible, and while Ice-T has some irritating moments he has moments where he is also fun. The best performances however come from Naomi Watts and especially Malcolm McDowell who is over-the-top but in an enjoyable way.However, the script is pretty awful. The one-liners are enough to make you cringe, the humour is stale and it also lacked the sassy black-humoured feel of the comic. The story has a great concept but for me suffered from being too unevenly paced(mostly rushed) and predictable with many moments of dumbness, a couple of limply paced scenes such as the musical scene at the Rippers' base and a few too many moments where it steers off track.Characters are a mixed bag. Tank Girl and Kesslee are fun enough, but Jet and Sub Girls are not as interesting personality-wise as they were in the comics and the Rippers more often than not are annoying. Another big disappointment is the direction, which is flashy but also too muddled, never knowing whether it is trying to handle a satire, comedy or futuristic action. Consequently the black, sassy humour could have benefited the satire and the comedy, but seeing as they were missing the humour to me seemed flat, and the more action-like parts looked clunky.Overall, I was willing to judge it on its own terms and to form my own opinion, but while I don't think Tank Girl is as bad as people say and I have seen far worse movies there wasn't really anything especially outstanding about it. 4/10 Bethany Cox "}{"Title":"Pure, unadulterated fun","Date":"4 November 2011","Score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Comedy, Sci-Fi","Review":" Some films just come at the wrong time and suffer for it.

The 1990s was full of movies that endured this fate, including such big budget flops as 'Waterworld' and this film. Based on the comic books of the same name, 'Tank Girl' is one of those films the studio just didn't know how to market.

I usually just want to believe that they do what they can.Poor Lori does physically resemble TG (in her 40's), and that could be very useful if you plan to enter a Tank Girl look alike competition (for middle aged women) but looks could hardly be the be all and end all of acting, so -to be completely blunt about this point- if you're just not talented enough to re-create TG. a.k.a one of the most violent characters in the history of comic books, just don't go on with the damn thing. Lori did it and made a good fool of herself, presenting the Muppet's version of Tank Girl. or something like that.

When really what they needed is someone who could pull off a fckn Mallory Knox. Gimmie Juliette Lewis. or Fairuza Balk. Anything but Pity.Something was definitely lost in the movie. and that is the feeling of real. The original comic strip was basically the comic version of the Sex Pistols. It's in-your-face tits and blood. and anarchy. and bombs. so you do the math.They stripped Tank Girl of her favorite weapons the black humor, hardcore lines and blatant nudity and turned her into a Disney princess or something. The whole things looks like a Disney movie.

I'm gonna go and say that the soundtrack is actually very listenable. Especially the song in the end which is Joan Jett's cover of 'Let's do it, let's fall in love' and another good thing about it is. well, Malcolm McDowell.So it's not really the worst movie in the planet, you see. and it was actually a tad fun.

Boy, was I wrong! This is a definition of guilty pleasure, or close to it for a mid 90s comic book movie, and it's one I would be more than happy to pop in on a sick day from work. It's a movie you have to smile at, feel like both the kid in you and the dirty bastard or girly girl loves to chomp on like some stupid comic book that has all the meat and gravy of a full-throttle action story mixed in with lots of irreverent humor. It pops and crackles like a comic book (hell, it even throws in animated segways, maybe as a way to save money, but it looks as cool as anything from the period), and it's got a weird ensemble ranging from Malcom McDowell to Iggy Pop and Ice-T... as a Kangaroo.Lori Petty stars in what could be considered a real career high point. Before seeing her in this I only remembered her as Geena Davis's sister in A League of Her Own, and wondered if she could pull it off. At first her image is like a junkyard Gwen Stefani (and Stefani of No Doubt period), but she's got the attitude of a real bad-ass, which is important as her role in this often pitts her into the likes of Snake Plissken and some other cowboy types, but always with the spunk of a punk rock chick with style and wit to spare. She's in a post apocalyptic world where water is a precious commodity (though, unlike Waterworld, it doesn't flaunt the irony of 'all this water and not a drop to drink', albeit there's a hot 'dust' shower scene). A mad commander of a corporation (McDowell, subtle ham-bone if there could be an oxymoron as such) who controls water and, thus, power. He captures her for hard slave labor, but she teams up with a young Naomi Watts and escapes to a renegade gang of kangaroos as they plot to destroy the evil corporation and...Yeah, kangaroos, and that's not all- one of them is really half kangaroo and half dog! It's all very silly, but it revels in its silliness, and makes a note of every other second or so reminding you how buoyant it is with its reckless energy and humor and design. It's a lot like if a Sci-fi channel of the week movie actually worked well; the production design isn't too tacky and eye-catching on a fairly low budget, the actors are all having a ball playing odds and ends of good guys or kangaroos or villainous water mongers. And at the middle is Petty, who is sweet and charming and dangerous and puts on an outfit and hair style like a reject from the latest Hot Topic catalog (and damn proud of it). You kind of have to dig what she's about in the part to dig a lot of the picture, but once plugged in- on top of stuff like McDowell's reconstruction surgery, Watts with black hair and glasses, and Ice-T and that guy from Buffy as kangaroo manimals- it's hard not to have a total gas with it. If you were a kid in the 90s, its hard not to have a go at it.

Rebecca, aka Tank Girl, is a wacky kid who teams up with her friend Jet Girl and the half-human, half-kangaroo Rippers to defeat the party-pooping bad guys and restore both justice and fun to the planet.This is a wild and wonderful science-fiction action flick, based on a great Dark Horse comic-book by Alan Martin and Jamie Hewlett, and is crammed full of so many nutty sequences and ideas that it's impossible to resist. It's sort of like Mad Max 2 with water instead of petrol, but it's so full of fun and the acting is so goofy that your eyes are always bugging out at what's on-screen, and it's fearless in its willingness to try anything. There are dozens of montages, thousands of superfast comic stills, several beautiful animated scenes (by Mike Smith), an epic musical number in a sex club, wild action sequences, a tribe of hippy kangaroo eco-warriors and a villain whose face gets chopped off halfway through. Central to it all is Petty, who nails Tank Girl's cheerful free-spirited mall-girl superwoman perfectly and is simply irresistible, and is ably supported by an admirably straight-faced Watts and a hilariously maniacal McDowell, plus a couple of very funny cameos by Hong and Pop. Extremely well directed, with an amazing sense of fun and visual dynamics, and great special effects by Stan Winston and Peter Crosman. Like most post-seventies youth-oriented films, this features a lot of very loud music cuts as a score; I normally dislike this practice, but here, because the film is so anarchic and the fast-paced editing style really does suit the story, the songs actually contribute a lot, and the featured artists are fun (notably Devo, L7 and Bjork). This is a great silly movie, with oodles to enjoy, and I think its unique quality as a sci-fi flick is probably down to the fact that the star, production designer and director were all women, who together have brought a very different sensibility to this kind of picture. A punk-rocking, tank-driving, thug-slapping, ass-shaking, good time movie.

Alongside her is Naomi Watts who plays Jet Girl in excellent fashion, as well as Ice-T and Malcolm McDowell as the sinister villain. The movie feels a lot like a low budget indie film that was picked up by a major studio, and there is reportedly some lost footage out there, but all in all, if you like movies like The Running Man or The Wraith or any other unconventional action/sci-fi movie, at very least, you will surely enjoy Tank Girl!

Directed by Rachel Talalay, the film is, visually, a little jarring, and the story is bizarre and really very silly. The jokes are mostly pretty crude, the premise for the plot is needlessly complex and the acting is nothing sensational. All in all, it's hard for me personally to come up with one valid reason for why I enjoyed it so much.The year is 2033, and the earth is now rather barren; since a meteor hit the planet 11 years ago, it has ceased to rain. Water and power have been monopolized by a big, heartless company, aptly named Water & Power, and run by evil super-villain Kesslee (Malcolm McDowell). In the desert, however, lies a hippie rebellion commune who are secretly stealing water, whilst attempting to stay safe from the infamous race of monsters that live under the earth, known as Rippers. Amongst this community lives Rebecca (Lori Petty), a boisterous, fun-loving, thrill seeker with no respect for authority. But when Water & Power soldiers find out that their water is being stolen, the hideout is raided, and Rebecca is taken captive to work for the evil Kesslee. But wait; there's more.Refusing to co-operate, Rebecca is kept with countless other prisoners until she accepts the offer. Whilst here she meets a shy, submissive mechanic girl known only as Jet (a young and dark-haired Naomi Watts, sporting her natural Australian accent). Convincing Jet to rebel against the oppressive institution and break free with her to claim their lives back, they steal a plane and a tank to escape, the latter of which Rebecca takes a liking to, and thus the title.And the film carries on in this manner. Really, the plot is just an accessory to the outrageous absurdity that is the film and that some will find funny and others will not. Though playing a rather irritating character, Lori Petty doesn't give a terrible performance as Rebecca, aka Tank Girl. Malcolm McDowell, Naomi Watts and music performer Ice-T also do the best that can be expected, and they are all clearly having fun with this big goof of a movie.One thing that the picture could be praised for, in terms of filmic value, is that it turns so many tired genres on their heads. The gratuitous violence and gaping plot holes akin to action movies (where the bad guys can never aim), the underlying voyeurism that seems to always come with Hollywood films that have any female characters, these things are all brought right out to the front and put in your face, a long overdue wake up call to film-makers who rely on such transparent cinema devices.Apart from this, Tank Girl is really just a big silly joke.

They kill pretty much everyone but capture Rebecca, who catches Kesslee's eye for fighting back so well. Condemned to work in the mines till she dies, Rebecca vows to escape and take revenge.There is much to like in this film and I can see why it has acquired a bit of a cult following it is different from the normal comic book movies mainly because the original material was so different. Although it throws up some cool moments and nice touches here and there, sadly the overall impression it made on me was one of messiness and uncertainty in the delivery. The plot is all over the place (for what it is) and the film seems to lack the courage to go the whole hog and genuinely just after fans of the comic book. Now, making a film more accessible than a comic is not a bad thing but making the whole project a mess in the attempt certainly is. The film tries to be crazy and irreverent but it forgets to do it consistently and within a good frame.The result is we get some cool moments of genuine invention but mainly what we get are lots of scenes where Petty and the others are set adrift in a sea of mania in the vague hope that somehow it will all work out. Giving her her dues, at least Petty tries hard to make it work but she lacks good material and is left looking a bit silly. If she had managed to be a strong female as opposed to just a pain in the ass then things might have been a bit better but as it is she gives a wildly one note performance. Watts is better just because she has a less grating character, has a stronger sexual presence and varies her delivery at times. Ice-T looks pretty embarrassed by the whole thing but he is the least irritating of the Rippers (Kober takes that award). McDowell scowls his way across the film with no real effort or originality but at least his OTT performance is sort of distracting.Director Talalay can moan about studio interference but there isn't much here to suggest that she was doing much good either. The use of music is as all over the place as everything else and generally she fails to make it much more than a curio piece (although the animated sections are a nice idea). Overall it is rather cheeky and crazy and in this way it may have enough rough charm about it to appeal to a small audience who buy into that sense of humour. However for me (and the majority I suspect) this is a poor affair that had some potential but mostly does very, very little with it.

Lets face it, it was never going to live up to the blood soaked comics but it has a lot going for it. Lori Petty stepped in at the last minute after Emily Watson dropped out. Pettys no TANK GIRL! but simply a tank-girl. As the film progresses, you can't help but warm to her as she parades her way through endless costumes and one liners. Alongside Petty is the pretty wonderful Naomi Watts as Jet girl. Watts shines through out the movie. The ripper effects are excellent although, in the comic Tank girl's beau is more like Ice-T's mean T-saint than cute-but-dim Booga. And of course we have the lovely Malcolm McDowell unashameadly hamming it up as villian Keslee. McDowell is clearly enjoying himself and you can't help but do the same. Well they've got the performances but what about the plot? The biggest let down really. The real tank-girl would never had put her butt on the line for a little girl no matter how cute; and how Keslee engineered the final battle it a bit unrealistic. But however between the plot holes is some great fun.Keslee's torture of Tank-girl, the Cole Porter sing-along and the calender shoot are all often inspired film making.

I also could have done without the comic strip inserts and animation scenes that pop up every now and then. The look of the movie is cartoony enough without having to remind the audience that it was based on a comic book.

Most of them are irritating, especially Tank Girl herself who is thoroughly punchable (and as many people have already pointed out, she spends the whole film making uncomfortably unfunny wisecracks).As an adaptation, it stinks. Tank Girl should be a nihilistic loudmouth Australian, burping and farting and starting fights, not a yappy perky American who likes little kids. Sub Girl and Jet Girl are nothing like their comic counterparts and neither are the kangaroos. I imagine if they'd tried to portray all the characters as they were in the comics, they'd have never got the script past the studio execs.I foolishly paid to see this in the cinema and came close to walking out - I only stayed to see if there was anything good about it at all. The only things of note were the sand showers, the little machine that sucks water out of people as it kills them and the Bjork song on the soundtrack.A few years later I tried to watch it again, hoping that maybe I was wrong first time round. I turned it off after 20 minutes, I couldn't stand any more than that.If you are one of the tiny number of people that used to buy Deadline in the early 90s and somehow missed this film, save yourself and don't bother.

If you didn't get the over the top humor in Buckaroo Banzai, or failed to see past it in Raising Arizona, you probably won't like Tank Girl. (you're probably wound a little tight as well and could stand a night out with your hair down...)  But movies don't have to be all things to all people, right?This is a fast, cheap, out of control romp through a tattered eared 'zine that's been passed around from kid to kid- one dimensional, goofy fun playing on all the base emotions, set in a perfectly imperfect future. The cast, Lori Petty, Ice-T (Ain't gone be no crumpets and tea!), Malcolm McDowell, Naomi Watts, Iggy Pop are ideal for this frenetically driven Buzzed-by Berkely style piece, which by the way, has an excellent hard edged soundtrack.Expect to know exactly who are the good and bad guys are. Expect post-apocalyptic glee, expect mutant ninja kangaroos, expect low-IQ stormtroopers, expect grrrlll power, good bad one-liners, and a bad-ass heroine that rides a tank!

The humor is a combination of high brow with a vary large sprinkling of idiocy, even managing to throw in a floor show half way through the film. It captures the feel of the British Comic quite well, while still working as a 94 minute movie.  The Ripper make up is quite good, and with the exception of a couple wires that can be seen (the budget wasn't that high...) the FX are actually quite good.

I thought Tank Girl was a fantastic attempt to bring the spirit of an Irreverent Comic Book Charicter to the Big Screen. I understand that in order to make a movie such as Tank Girl marketable a Studio in this case United Artists must attempt to appeal to as many people as possable. Therefor some but clearly not all of the spirit of the origional Comic Book Charicter is lost.I have heard several reports about this film and let's just say that not all of them were favorable. However many people do not read comic books and therefore don't have the background to truly judge the attempt. If they had perhaps other comic to movie projects would have been reviewed more favorabley I.E. Judge Dredd, The Mask, Barb Wire.I must state that I don't think a movie could have been cast with more accuracy. Lori Petty is the perfect Rebecca a.k.a. Tank Girl. As her charicter Tank Girl She exuded irreverence, sarcasm, and spunk. Naomi Watts renderd a perfect Jet Girl A woman struggling to become herself. Ice-T was the perfect Ney-sayer, and Malcolm McDowell was evil incarnate.Personally I realy liked the movie. I attended the original screening at a local theater and I am an owner of the Home Video version of the film.I was terribly sad to hear that there was a lot of original footage cut from the final product. Perhaps this footage would have brought the full character development that many of the films critics thought was missing.I was Outraged that the Studio will not allow a Directors Cut. I sincerely hope they will someday. Perhaps a DVD special edition with all the missing footage... A videofile like me can only dream.

Tank Girl!!","Date":"24 November 2001","Score":"3 out of 7 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Comedy, Sci-Fi","Review":"  (Slight digression.) This movie reminds me of a bottle of French Bordeaux wine that I stumbled across several years ago in a wine shop in Seattle. At first glance, the wine was not particularly remarkable - it was from an average winery, was marked with a ridiculously low price, and nothing on the label indicated that it was quality goods. In other words, it was just a bottle of red. But I bought it anyway, figuring, just for a goof, I'd give it a try. To my immense surprise, it turned out to be an excellent wine - every bit as good as some of the better (and much higher priced) vintage French wines from the Bordeaux region. It had depth, character, complexity, hints and shades of this and that, and (oh heck, pick your own wine-snob jargon here!) - in short, it was a *really* good bottle of red wine.And so it turned out to be with this movie, Tank Girl. I tuned in to this movie the other day on the Comedy Channel. Having nothing better to do I figured it would be fun to watch what appeared to be your average CC comedy. But it turned out to be WAY better than my original anticipations.It's basically a very zany screwball sort of sci-fi comedy (I'm not sure what genre would neatly describe it - hence, sci-fi comedy). It's also a sort of psychedelic freak-out trip - a trip into a vast, dark/light futuristic wasteland populated by survivors of (what?) a giant comet splashing down on good old Mother Earth, which apparently causes the instant evaporation of nearly all surface water on the planet. And it hasn't rained in 11 years. As a result, all over the planet, water is in short supply (REAL short supply... like, Fancy a pint? Fuhgetaboutit!!). The movie basically revolves around the various schemes of various scheming people (headed by a delightfully diabolical madman named Kesslee, played by Malcolm McDowell - who, by the way, could easily have played Dr. Hannibal Lecter in Silence of the Lambs) to control the world's remaining artesian water.The good guys in this movie are, by and large, not guys, but girls (though if you are at all like me, you may be hard pressed to call Lori Petty a girl... oh yeah, and also there are the Rippers - interesting creatures who are good-guy kangaroo-men). Come to think of it, in many respects this is essentially a guy movie... it's just that it has butt-kickin' chicks playing some of the roles customarily occupied by guys.The movie on one level is a non-stop high-energy riot of laughs, spoofs, gags, smart-alecky oneliners, impossibly heroic stunts, corndog costumes (WAY corndog), wacky high-tech devices, goofball dialogue, and ham acting. But at the same time on yet another level, there are many segments of extremely provocative and eyebrow-raising harshness and seriousness. (I don't want to spoil anything for those who haven't seen it, but as an example, there is one scene that has the evil Kesslee taking a kidnapped little girl and sliding her down a long tube, where she becomes firmly jammed, and then the tube begins very slowly to fill with water, threatening her with certain drowning... It was disturbing, and positively creepy!).Thankfully I taped the movie and was able to watch it several more times - which is recommended, because, the movie moves along at a disarmingly fast pace (like a comet through a cat kennel) and you need to see several scenes more than once just to take in all the rich wacky variety that has been worked into them. Just looking at Tank Girl's costume in some scenes alone is an eye-popping experience she appears decked out in a charming, New Wave sort of Nuclear Chic - like, maybe to accessorize she stood down range from Crud Factory No. 1, which then got blown to bits by a nuclear bomb, and then all the crud (glowing radioactive, too) gently wafted down on her and stuck to her body. Yeah, that's how she really looks at times! And talk about a bad hair day - sheeesh! The hot winds from the aforementioned nuclear blast must have been used to blow-dry her hair. See the movie, you won't disagree.The soundtrack should appeal to many it is loaded with lots of edgy Punk/New Wave/Power Guitar riffs (and heck, Iggy Pop himself has a brief but funny appearance in the movie). I really liked the soundtrack, and plan on going out to purchase it.Granted, not everybody will like this sort of zany sci-fi comedy stuff... it IS sort of a brain freaker. But in more than a few ways it will remind you of another well-received movie from the same genre Earth Girls are Easy. It has that same irreverent chick-power charm, with lots of zany costuming, smart-alecky lines, strange looking creatures, etc. I quickly discovered that I liked this movie just as much as Earth Girls are Easy - I'm just a bit surprised that Tank Girl wasn't as well received.Yes, some of you, upon finishing the movie, will say Tank Girl? - Tank God it's over! Others, like me, will say, Tanks for the Memories! and will want to watch it again and again. And if you like it, go tell your friends to watch it. It really deserves more credit than it's been given, IMHO. It should also make for a good party film. Well, that's all I've got to say about Tank Girl. Tanks for listening, good night everybody!

I have no idea what genius said, Hey, this will be an entertaining movie! but I hope they fired, tormented and made fun of his/her weight problem! Because the day Tank Girl got green lighted, it was destined to get a 3 out of 10!

I usually wait until the end of the movie before I even think of writing a review at IMDB.  But this film is so awful, I might as well do it now. What can I say?  There's so much wrong with it.  Like Lori Petty for instance, who looks anorexic. Another poster mentioned Gwen Stefani as a better choice.  That sounded like more inspired casting to me.  Even Cyndi Lauper, though a tad past it, would've been good.  If there's much of a story, besides the quest for water, I can't see one.  The only really good bits of the film, are when the cartoon sequences appear.  And you think to yourself Why didn't they just make the whole darn thing as a feature length comic strip.

I have a few things to say about it.. first of all, I kept imaginging Tank Girl would have been much betterplayed by Gwen Stefani, since she already had that punk kind of look.  Second.. now I've found out what discovered all the punk-poseurs of today.  My school is filled with them, and the vast majority are just wannabes with nothing intelligent or witty to say.  They just try to dress different, but theres so many of them its not even different anymore. This movie was ok I guess.  To quote someone who posted before, yeah, her voice was really grating.  That was probably the worst part.  The idea of it being in the future and holding the water was pretty cool, but they didnt go into that enough, taking a lot away from the film.  I give this erm.. i dunno, a 6/10 I suppose.  Between 6 and 7.  I'd recommend seeing it, just because you can learn where all the punk-poseurs have come from too.

If she wasn't in it, I would have turned it off. She lights up any screen. I am surprised that she didn't get popular sooner. Now back to the movie, the makeup was good, with the Kangaroo men things (The Rippers) and I suppose it followed the comic book well, but it's too twisted to be a movie.

Second, it get's REALLY annoying hearing her every 30 seconds go Pa-Pow or BOOM! or whatever else she must say to try and make the movie funny. Her outfits and hair styles are ugly and her singing voice sucks.  Pretty good idea for a story though In the future, a comet crashes on earth destroying just about everything. (hmmm...Mel Gibson...Mad Max...)There is a limited supply of water left. (hmmm...Mel Gibson..Mad Max...limited supply of gas...) and the survivors of earth will do anything to get it. (hmmm...Mel Gibson..Mad Max...fighting for the gas...) ok I'll stop.There is a facility where the Water and Power operate. One of the best villians ever created wants every drop of water for himself.Good idea for a movie...if Mel Gibson hadn't done a similar movie already!!! What were they thinking casting a nearly bald and hideous woman like Lori?!Oh and the Rippers...pretty good...not the type of people I would've casted for the parts...but whatever... If they had casted someone else to play Tank Girl and the Rippers this could've been pretty good.  8/10 on the story 6/10 for the movie overall  "},{"Title":"I tried by best to like this movie.....","Date":"18 July 2001","Score":"0 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Comedy, Sci-Fi","Review":"     But in the end I regreted ever seeing it.  It's just another one of those post-apocolypic sci-fi movies.  Tank Girl actually had me rooting for Malcolm McDowell's character.  Lori Petty didn't even act like a super heroine, she kept making these lame wise-cracks every five minutes.  Instead she had the personality of Misty Williams (from Pokemon) on crack cocaine!   Also, the pathetic choice of cast members like Ice-T playing a kangaroo?  And the soundtrack that had one of Courtney Love's songs on there!  Yuck!  And this was one of her favorite movies so to speak! Quadruple yuck!  What a waste of time this was when I saw it.  The only good thing about this movie was that they played a Nirvana song in it.  And the way the little girl who was a friend of hers got kidnapped really offended me because I thought that was child exploitation.  If I had known someone like Tank Girl at that age, I would've been scared of her!  I never liked rap music, either.  This movie was a total travesty in every way, shape, and form.   Tank Girl is a negative example of girl power.  If you want to see some real girl power in action, then go rent Charlie's Angels or Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon, or watch an episode of Martial Law instead.  In the meantime, avoid this movie at all costs!  Listen to a Nirvana album instead!  )  I give Tank Girl zero stars!

Inspired by a comics series, it mixes actual comics titles with film. The characters are no more complex than comics characters, and the action-filled story ends by repeating itself. However, if you get in the mood, and if you ever liked reading comics stories, you may survive the film. Some of the effects are good, though most of them smell cheap budget. Punk and hard rock dominate the soundtrack, as you may expect. 5/10 on my personal scale.

The script was putrid backwash from some writer's subconscious.  I could have made a better movie using action figues in my back yard with a super-8 camera and a box of cheetos.  That chester cheetah, what a guy.  Malcolm Macdowell must have been eating out of dumpsters to accept this obviously half-dimensional role.  Where did all these moronic one-liners that poured from Tank Girl's mouth come from?  She would act ten times more skillfully if she got a lobotomy.  There's only thing i can say about casting Ice-T in this movie  Why?   I hope the madness will end someday.  There was only one redeeming characteristic about this movie, and that was jet-girl. She was a babe.  Too bad she was covered in grease for most of the movie.

Pretty silly stuff with a standard post-apocalyptic storyline. I liked the overall imagination and intermixing of the original comic book text and real life, with some great tunes thrown in. The problem is the characters never really made it credible-as either cartoon stand-ins or real life. Ice-T plays his standard cardboard character that he plays in every movie and you'll either like Lori Petty's girl with attitude role (especially if you are 14 year old male or younger) or you won't. Personally it started to grate on my nerves about half way thru. The brainy sidekick was not only completely unbelievable (single handedly creating a tank and jet fighter that responds to voice commands) but not terribly well acted either(first role perhaps?)-OK I know it was supposed to be fantasy.In the end the comic strip was probably better.
