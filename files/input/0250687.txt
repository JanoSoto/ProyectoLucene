[{"Title":"It's A Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad-- Rat Race?","Date":"7 February 2002","Score":"86 out of 117 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Adventure, Comedy","Review":"  If you've seen the trailer for this movie, you're probably thinking it looks hilarious and you've made a mental note that it's one you don't want to miss.  More often than not, however, the funniest stuff is in the previews, and when you see the whole movie it's a let-down.  But I'm here to tell you, that is decidedly NOT the case with `Rat Race,' directed by Jerry Zucker, and furthermore, make a mental note  This movie is hilarious, and one you DO NOT want to miss.  In the tradition of Stanley Kramer's 1963 BIG comedy hit, `It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World,' this one is exactly what it is supposed to be-- Fun (yes, with a capital `F'), and Funny-- with one laugh after another that just keep on a-comin'.Las Vegas casino owner Donald Sinclair (John Cleese), likes to offer his elite customers-- the `high rollers'-- something they can't get anywhere else, in the form of things they can gamble on that are so bizarre you can only imagine.  And the big one he comes up with this time begins with the planting of six lucky tokens in his slot machines.  Those who win the tokens are invited to attend a meeting, at which time Sinclair announces that they are to be the lucky participants in a `race' of sorts.  In a train station locker in the small town of Silver City, New Mexico, there is $2,000,000 waiting for whomever gets to it first.  He passes out six identical keys to the token bearers that will open the locker, shouts `Go!' and they're off! And Sinclair's high rollers proceed to put down some big bucks on their favorite horse-- uh, dog!-- uh-- Well, you get the idea...The participants include Nick (Breckin Meyer), who is pretty much just a regular guy; NFL referee Owen Templeton (Cuba Gooding Jr.), hated by millions because of a recent botched call; brothers Duane and Blaine Cody (Seth Green, Vince Vieluf), not the brightest bulbs to begin with, and hampered in their communications by Blaine's newly pierced tongue; a mother, Vera (Whoopi Goldberg), and the daughter she gave up for adoption and with whom she has just reunited, Merrill (Lanei Chapman); Randy Pear (Jon Lovitz), who has a hard time making his wife, Bev (Kathy Najimy), and their two kids, Kimberly (Jillian Marie) and Jason (Brody Smith) understand why he's interrupted their Vegas vacation to drag them off suddenly to New Mexico; and-- last but not least-- Enrico Pollini (Rowan Atkinson), a narcoleptic Italian.  It's quite the eclectic bunch, and they definitely put on quite a show.During the rush for the gold, they encounter a number of people and situations that drive the laugh meter through the roof, including  A woman (Kathy Bates) selling squirrels by the roadside (Vera and Merrill); a group of `Lucy' impersonators on their way to some kind of Lucy convention (Owen); a `Barbie' museum that isn't what it seems, and not a great place for the Jewish Pear family to visit; an errant cow, a hot air balloon and a guy who overhears too much (Duane and Blaine); a jealous helicopter pilot named Tracy (Amy Smart), who buzzes her boyfriend's house at a most inopportune time (Nick); an ambulance driver, Zack (Wayne Knight), who is transporting a human heart for a transplant, and suffers something akin to the same fate as that famous `cat' due to his curiosity (Enrico).  Zucker and writer Andy Breckman pulled out all the stops with this one, and the result (and there's much, much, MUCH more than what's mentioned here) is some pretty wild stuff.The secret to making this all work, is above all to keep it moving-- and Zucker certainly does that.  He relies heavily on sight gags and slapstick, and knows how to set up the schtick for a real payoff, which he succeeds at time and again throughout the entire film.  it's all fairly controlled insanity, and with a couple of exceptions when Zucker wanders into Jim Carrey/Farrelly Brothers territory, it's pretty easy to swallow.  Most importantly, IT'S FUNNY! with enough different kinds of humor thrown in to satisfy just about any taste.  And that's a rare thing to be said of any comedy, and it's a big part of why this one's such a gem.The cast is superb, but the highlights have to be Cuba Gooding Jr., who demonstrates a real knack for comedy; John Cleese, who can make you laugh just by smiling, brandishing as he does a spectacular set of teeth; and Rowan Atkinson, who does some masterful bits of physical comedy, the likes of which rivals the best of Peter Sellers and Buster Keaton.  The way he mugs and moves is absolutely hysterical.The supporting cast includes Gloria Allred (Herself), Dave Thomas (Mr. Grisham), Dean Cain (Shawn), Paul Rodriguez (Gus), Brandy Ledford (Vicky), Tristin Leffler (Pierced Girl) and Andrew Kavovit.  One that lives up to it's expectations and more, `Rat Race' is everything you want it to be, a laugh a minute movie that never lets up, and one that won't wear your brain out making you think about it too much.  This is pure entertainment that'll lead you down the road to riot (make that `laugh' riot).  There hasn't been anything quite like this since Jimmy Durante kicked that bucket and started that other bunch of madcaps off looking for `The big 'dub-a-yeh'.'  Zucker and his gang really pulled this one off, and moreover, they did it with style.  And that's the magic of the movies.  I rate this one 8/10.

So it could happen that such a movie receives a greater mark than a movie from a different category, which by the way has a greater artistic value. Anyway, if you like non-sense movies with absurd scenes, this is for you. The movie succeeds without clever jokes, with its hilarious scenes to make fun of the greedy or the don't know how to spend their money people. One absurd scene follows the other, and if you like such humor you will soon find yourself convulsed with laughter. Sometimes it may appear forced, but this is a characteristic for the genre. If you just want a fun and action packed movie, this is a very good choice. "},{"Title":"Very funny and entertaining. You're bound to have a good time. *** (out of four)","Date":"18 September 2001","Score":"64 out of 79 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Adventure, Comedy","Review":"  RAT RACE / (2001) *** (out of four	Rat Race revives a genre Hollywood has neglected since the sixties the big event, ensemble chase comedy. Who better to breathe life into the subject than Jerry Zucker, the mastermind behind the Naked Gun films, and Airplane, two of the most hilarious movies I have seen. After years of directing straight dramas, Zucker says he is thrilled to be back doing comedy. It's very visual and there are lots of big visual stunts, Zucker explains in the film's production notes, kind of a James Bond comedy in a way because there are so many sight gags.	Good comparison-Race Race is indeed a visual comedy. Its laugh-a-minute attitude works for the creative situations.  The audience does not necessarily laugh at every single joke the movie throws, but the humor is timed well. Rat Race also contains a terrific cast and provides enough laughs to be worthy of at least one viewing.   	John Cleese stars as the eccentric Las Vegas casino tycoon named Donald Sinclair. He wants to keep his wealthy, high stakes gamblers interested in his gambling techniques so he arranges a new, quasi-legal sporting event for them to bet on a human rat race.Sinclair randomly places six golden coins in several different slot machines. The customer service sends the winners to a large banquet room where the characters learn of a two million dollar jackpot resting in a duffel bag, inside a locker, within the city of Silver City, New Mexico-seven hundred miles away. The fist one there keeps all of the money, tax-free. &#133;the odds of winning are one and six&#133; explains Sinclair. There's only one rule there are no rules! 	 The players include a vast variety of different characters. There is Vera Baker (Whoopi Goldberg), who, after giving her child up for adoption as a baby, has decided to meet her daughter, Merrill (Lanai Chapman). Owen Temleton (Cuba Gooding, Jr.), an NFL coach who recently blew an important game, has come to the sin city to forget his horrendous mistake. Mr. Pollini (Rowan Akinson from Bean) is an exuberantly cheerful, but narcoleptic, Italian fellow. Randy Pear (Jon Lovitz), and his family is vacationing when he slips off to play slots and wins the chance of a lifetime. The Cody brothers (Seth Green and Vince Vieluf), are first to cause trouble in any crowd. Finally, Nick (Breckin Meyer) a skeptical young lawyer-in-training, meets a charming young woman (Amy Smart), and encounters plenty of adventures with her.  Rat Race offers plenty of hit and miss humor. Much of it misses, but much of it hits the mark as well. The majority of the humor is physical and exaggerated. Very little offers sharp, witty satire on any part of culture. The film says something about greed in a zany sort of way, but for the most part this is just a two hour laugh riot, nothing more, nothing less.However, this is a tricky script to write, and for the overall result to provide this much effective comic material, Andrew Breckman's ingenious script is indeed successful. It's not easy writing a comedy like this, and Breckman does indeed run into a few problems in the overcrowded plot. Even more difficult is creating a conclusion for a story like this. No matter how you end it, you are certain to displease at least some audience members. Breckman has found a way to have his cake and eat it too. I would never dream of revealing how this race concludes itself, but I will say it is not exceedingly satisfying, but sure does work over the obvious other possibilities. Rat Race is one of the funniest movies of the year. It's energetic, irrelevant, and entertaining. You are sure to have a decent time.

Bringing many comedy stars together under one roof hasn't been done often enough. It did happen in Mars Attacks, which turned out to be a total waste of time and was and absolutely horrible movie. In this case however, the actors/actresses aren't awkwardly stuck into their roles, they all sink into very unique characters who each have a story to tell.

However, like  has happened on many other occasions, I was  surprised by the humor in the film. While the  principal characters were important in the  movie, why didn't Wayne Knight get any billing?  He's probably one of the best overweight  actors since John Candy, and this guy can't  get any work!? He was the only good reason  to watch Seinfeld. Anyway, I felt this movie  was quite a departure for some actors, and  a great one for those who have made a movie  such as this before. Jon Lovitz was excellent  in this film, along with Mr. Bean (or Rowan  Atkinson as he is called by non-Mr. Bean fans,  who must be a sad group of people). The  only downside to this film was the ending, which  had yet another bad song by Smashmouth  (and it was All-Star once again!). Overall,  a good movie.

I can never remember), so it's not fair to make comparisons - but the changes I know about sound as though they're improvements.  The sum of money in the original film was $350 000; this time it's $2 million, which (adjusting for inflation) is considerably less.  In the original the money was a fifteen-year-old buried treasure; here, it's just money.  An eccentric squillionaire has put it in a locker without explanation.  WE get an explanation, of sorts, but the racers do not - so there is no romance attached to the prize, which means that all of their actions are PURE expressions of greed.  (John Cleese is the squillionaire, and while his cameo in The World Is Not Enough proved that he could, with the right material, fail to be funny, he and his coterie of wealthy compulsive gamblers are hilarious here.  It's good counterpoint humour, since they're actually the least greedy, most disinterested people involved in the chase.)A criticism levelled at the original was that innocent, well-meaning bystanders got hurt - that it was meant to be a joke when their property was destroyed, but the joke wasn't funny.  Rat Race avoids being open to the same charge by making the world an even more venal one.  The ambulance-chasing lawyer, the live organ courier, the quirky roadside squirrel-seller, the key-cutter, the garage mechanic, the neo-Nazis, the vengeful taxi driver ... all these people have less attractive personalities than any of the racers.  Only a few of them are punished, but among them are the only outsiders to be punished at all.  (With the exception, I'll admit, of people we never see, like the anonymous owners of cars that are run over in the parking lot.)Whoopi Goldberg plays it straight, which suits her.  I can't fault the acting anywhere, but I do wish that Rowan Atkinson hadn't been cast as the loopy, dim-witted Italian (I can't see this picture playing in Italy at all).  To be sure, he brings the role off, and he's the only person who could have done so - but he would have been funnier if he'd been allowed to be more intelligent, to have a little more rat cunning hiding beneath the surface.  (For half a second, he DOES exhibit cunning it's by far his funniest moment.)All scenes before the race is announced fall flat.  Timing and motivation just weren't there, and I even wondered afterwards if Zucker had handed his establishing scenes to an ungifted underling.  But I don't want to carp at a funny film by saying it could have been funnier.  Things pick up considerably as soon as John Cleese outlines the central premise; from then on the film is never less than inventive, and even if (for some reason) you don't find it funny, you must admit that those involved at least had the right IDEA about comedy.

I adore Airplane!, Top Secret!, Ruthless People, and The Naked Gun.

OK, so Shrek is more likely seen as the funniest film of the year by critics, but in terms of my own personal enjoyment, Rat Race is it.Jon Lovitz and family were great; the whole Nazi bit was absolutely inspired. Whoopi Goldberg and Lanei Chapman were fabulous, the squirrel bit was one of the funniest scenes of the movie. Amy Smart and Brecken Meyer - well, there had to be a little romance in this movie; not bad performances by either. Seth Green and Vince Vieluf were hilarious. Every word out of Rowan Atkinson's mouth made me laugh (It's a race, it's a race! I'm winning, I'm winning!). Cuba Gooding, Jr. was also very funny. John Cleese and the other gamblers proved to be another great subplot (the scene with the hooker is my favorite scene of the movie).Some people commented on the ending. Yes, it seemed a bit out of place judging by the whole do-anything-to-get-the-money theme of the movie, but I guess everyone has a soft spot.

I watched it last night and I have to say that I cannot believe that I missed out on this film! I thought that Rat Race is one of the funniest movies I have seen. As silly and outrageous as the humor is, I think that's just what I needed to put me in a good mood. The cast in Rat Race is absolutely perfect, they couldn't have picked a more comedic cast, not only that, but they all clicked so well together and made the film just an absolute blast to watch. Not to mention, cows are just getting a reputation as the perfect comedic relief, just look at not only Rat Race, but Twister, lol. The story is extremely clever, just how far most people would go to get money in their pockets.Donald P. Sinclair is a huge millionaire, he's so rich in fact, that he and his other rich buddies place the most obscene bets and they've just come up with the most cruel one of all. In a Las Vegas casino, several people have won a coin saying that they've won something. Donald has place two million dollars in a locker in Silver City, New Mexico. At first the group just laughs at him feeling like they've been scammed, but they think about it, and decide to just go for it. They all have to travel over two hundred miles while being watched by the rich group is watching them and betting on who is going to win the cash.Rat Race is incredibly clever and just a whole lot of fun to watch. Another great thing about this film is that it puts you in a great mood, you gotta love the comedies that can't stop make you laughing out loud. I think my favorite team was without a doubt Seth Green and his brother, they were just classic. I loved it when they had to stop all the flights from getting out so that they could have the same head start.

Frankenstein was the other one. In this one, he plays an eccentric billionaire who loves a good bet. In a later sequence of the film, he has his pilot wobble the plane around violently in order to see who will throw up first. But central to this film's plot is that he gathers a good ten people to partake in a bet on a grand scale. In a locker within a train station in New Mexico, he has stashed two million dollars and made six copies of the key. The first team to get there, unlock the locker, and take the money gets to keep it.Assembled for this mad race are a Narcoleptic Indian migrant (Rowan Atkinson), a materially-obsessed businesswoman and her long-lost mother (Whoopi Goldberg), and a football referee who is hated because of a botched coin toss call (Cuba Gooding, Jr. in a welcome return to form). And those are just the ones that have the craziest adventures (and the easiest ones to remember the actors' names). I would have liked to have seen what Bobcat Goldthwait would have done in a role like this, but there is always next time.What makes this race so amusing is that no plausible extreme is deemed too over the top. A helicopter buzzing the pilot's boyfriend's house? Check. Driving to New Mexico with a bunch of Lucille Ball impersonators? Check. Hanging by a rope from a balloon and smashing into the sides of cows? Check. Even the opportunity to visit a World War II Revisionist museum and crash a convention of World War II veterans while physical injuries make you look like a bad Hitler impersonator isn't taboo here.The only low point is the ending. After all of that excitement and lunacy, I really expected something better. Instead of a grand finale in which one last attempt is made to defy logic or reason, we get a corny cop-out ending at a concert for some lame pop band that wishes it was alternative. Not exactly what I would call a fitting end to one of the first films made in the last ten years that had me laughing from the beginning to the end.So all in all, ten out of ten for the build-up, but minus two for the climax.

Plenty of creativity no matter how absurd it gets and the sheer zany atmosphere will keep you smiling whether the jokes hit or miss.First and foremost, Kathy Bates as the squirrel lady STEALS THE WHOLE MOVIE!  It was brilliant and sinister all at once.  John Lovitz really carries the film and is such a natural (I still think he deserves huge praise for Mom And Dad Save The World).  Not only is the Barbie Museum scene excrutiatingly funny (watch his eyes move around!) but his confrontation with the World War II vets will definitely be considered one of comedy's funniest moments in film.  Would have made Mel Brooks proud! While Hollywood seems to be trying to focus so much on established tired comics like Eddie Murphy, it's really guys like Lovitz that have a true knack for comedy.  He's underappreciated and made a great team with Kathy Najimy for this film (what he makes the poor daughter do so to avoid a rest stop is so nuts it brings back quite a few memories of family vacations I was subjected too!). Cuba Gooding, Jr.'s funnier moments were really when he would try to dodge being recognized as that bonehead, and Whoopie Goldberg is funny because it almost seems as if her character from Ghost were transplanted into this film.  Seth Green is surprisingly likeable though his character stops at nothing to get ahead in the race.Besides the squirrel bit, other small things really shine more than some of the more played out segments.  For instance, the rental car trainee had me really laughing as well as the gentle nature of the skinhead tour guides.  These worked better than even the flying cow or the busload of Lucys.  You'll really get a giggle out of the baby on the train, his lack of reaction to Rowan Atkinson made Rowan's role in the film more worthwhile.  Gloria Allred yelling out a building I SAW THAT! I'LL BE RIGHT DOWN! when witnessing Wayne Knight running into Rowan Atkinson was a great moment.While not 100% funny, Rat Race offers just enough zest to keep you entertained.  Some of the strangest chases I've ever seen, and that helicopter on a rampage is a WOW.  It's also nice to see faces like Rance Howard, Dean Cain, Colleen Camp, Wayne Knight, and Dave Thomas too.  All this adds up to quite a lot of fun until the Smash Mouth concert....I don't mind a happy ending, but this could have been worked out just a little better.  It just seems when you put a band that's popular at the moment in a concert scene, especially at the end, the film crashes. Ah well, at least Rat Race offers plenty more to enjoy, and is perfect for a good old silly time.One thing's for sure, I can't get that choir version of the song Rat Race out of my head and I think I'm going to have to go get the soundtrack now!

I'm giving this movie four stars out of four. Not that it's a brilliant piece of moviemaking or anything. But, it does exactly what it sets out to do - it is funny. Very funny. In fact, side-splittingly gut-wrenchingly funny. Funny enough to make it hysterical even after viewing it ten times.The plot is simple six strangers are rounded up and put into a race to get to Silver City, New Mexico - and $2 million that's in a locker there. From there, the racers, including a straight-faced Chicago lawyer (Breckin Meyer), a narcoleptic Italian tourist (Rowan Atkinson), a re-united mother/daughter team (Whoopi Goldberg/Lanei Chapman), a pair of scheming con artists (Seth Green/Vince Vieluf), a disgraced football referree (Cuba Gooding Jr.) and, funniest of all, a father of two who cannot tell his family why he is driving like a maniac to reach New Mexico (Jon Lovitz) are off on a frantic race to grab the cash, while wealthy hotel owner Donald Sinclair (John Cleese) watches with his favorite high rollers from a penthouse suite in Vegas.This is definitely not a light comedy. When you go into this movie, be prepared to laugh, and to laugh HARD. When I first saw it, I had tears in my eyes, and I was clutching my sides as I slid out of my seat in fits of very loud laughter. There are several scenes in the movie that do this to people including one scene that you have to see to believe, involving a man being chased up a satellite tower by a car. And then there's two men having a fight using a cow. Or maybe a game of cat and mouse between a pickup truck and a helicopter is more your style. Whatever it is you laugh at, you're bound to find it in this movie, and much, much more. It's not just a great comedy - it takes the cake in my book as the funniest comedy ever made.Rat Race is rated PG-13 for crude humor, violence and brief nudity. Despite these warning labels, however, it's a very mild PG-13, bordering sharply on a PG rating.

Yet again, I revisit another film I idolized as a child. This was probably one of the first truly adult films I watched at a very young age. I've mentioned before I watched a lot of inappropriate things as a child, but somethings, left a permanent mark on me as a child and Rat Race is certainly one of them.Sometimes, people ask me what got interested and familiar with film and I have to say Rat Race. This was the first film that introduced me to all the big named celebrities at the time. Everyone in this film is currently an active celebrity and has a number of movies under their belt, and I knew everyone's name by the second viewing. So, in terms of actors, I can honestly say, this one got me the most familiar with many of them.The story is on its own medicine; The eccentric owner of a hotel resort named Donald Sinclair (Cleese) creates a new game to entertain the high-rollers of the casino where he will place six golden tokens in slot machines. Whoever gets a token, will be given a key. A key that opens a special locker in a train station in Silver City, New Mexico. In the locker is a duffel bag filled with $2 million. Whoever gets there first, claims the money. Simple as that.The people involved are played by Breckin Meyer, Cuba Gooding Jr., Amy Smart, Jon Lovitz, Rowan Atkinson, Whoopi Goldberg, Seth Green, Lanei Chapman, and Vince Vieluf. Clearly, nothing shy of an ensemble comedy cast. After the rules are explained, the gang runs around like rats in a maze doing everything they can to get from Vegas to New Mexico as quickly as possible.As one can imagine, they run into nothing but sticky, and undeniably hilarious, situations which causes grief on their part. It's classic laugh-at-someone-else's-misery-comedy executed very well. The film sort of mixes classics like Stanley Kramer's It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World and Scavenger Hunt. Both films involved run of the mill situations, and characters struggling to make the next move half the time.The only downside here, is the film gets carried away with itself. It's a bit too contrived, and very coincidental. But in a way it has to be to keep the comedy and action at a consistent level, and the irony and fun existing. Despite its own medicine being a bit too strong, Rat Race combines a great score along with it. The music in this film matches pitch perfectly to the stressful scenes, and the tense atmosphere these characters are clearly occupying.Also equipped with delightful cameos, hilarious little side-stories, one of the best opening intros in recent memory, and an unexpecting and cherished end scene that shows even when consumed with greed and self-absorption that people are still likely to do admirable things, Rat Race is nothing shy of funny and well-made comedy. The audience it will attract is interesting because it can be fans of a good cast, fans of craziness in films, fans of classic cinema, fans of just good films, or a combination of every type. It's a universally appealing film that stands out for more than just its actors, but its message and its execution is all just remarkable.Starring Rowan Atkinson, John Cleese, Whoopi Goldberg, Cuba Gooding Jr., Seth Green, Jon Lovitz, Breckin Meyer, Amy Smart, Kathy Najimy, Lanei Chapman, Vince Vieluf, Dave Thomas, Wayne Knight, Kathy Bates, and Dean Cain. Directed by Jerry Zucker.

I didn't know anything about the movie going in, and then i saw the names of the cast, and the director, and I knew I was in for a treat. It started off tamely enough, and then launched into the funniest movie I've seen since the first Naked Gun. I just can't praise it enough, the jokes and gags are VERY funny, and there's not one shred of Farelly brothers style grossout humour. It's a riot.Now the gripes people seem to have with this movie. First the slapstick, supposedly lowbrow humour it has. I don't know about you, but I don't find satire or cerebral humour to be as funny as complete and utter well-timed silliness can be. I don't mean I don't get it, I get it, and I find it amusing, and I laugh. But sometimes you want a movie that makes you laugh so hard it hurts and you fall off your chair. And this movie does just that, the jokes are incredibly inventive. Barbie museum. Pepto-Bismol bath. A sign from god. A short cut. Windshield cleaning. Et cetera, et cetera.And then there's the 'this isn't a kids movie, they said Afro Whores'. It's a PG-13 movie. That means anyone under thirteen not allowed without parents. Technically, don't take anyone under 10 to a PG-13 movie. And I dare you to find me one kid with a double digit age that doesn't know what the word 'whore' means, and yet has been raised outside a cardboard box.

Bonus points are given for giving Jon Lovitz a funny script to play with creating an insanely funny bit about Hitler's car.  However, while everything Lovitz touches turns to gold, reusing the same tired couple from Road Trip was a terrible idea.  Brecken Myer can be good, I saw him as a wigger in Go and he was pretty decent but he's just doing the same old sitcom type humour with Amy Smart as his copilot.  John Cleese is funny as usual, this time as an eccentric billionaire with a taste for interesting betting.  Whoopie Goldberg, however, hasn't been funny since Eddie Murphy was funny and her parts are painfully unfunny jaunts.  Throw in some decent piercing jokes, balanced with tired cow humour, Lucy's galor combined with Cuba Gooding failing at funny, some Mr. Bean playing Mr. Bean and Newman playing Newman and you've got a screwball comedy that is too uneven to be a great comedy.  It's no Airplane or Naked Gun but there's not a grossout comedy or a romantic comedy, just good Zucker style humour with some physical comedy.

The writers did an incredible job with the ending, so make sure NO ONE gives away the ending to you. So watch Rat Race if you want some good laughs and follow the movie to find out who wins!

Some of the jokes are a little stupid, but nothing in the league of the anti-intellectual Dumb and Dumber. There's a bit of an edge, so the film doesn't fall 100% in the sappy family comedy genre and should entice those who normally enjoy battles of witty put-downs in their comedies. The film is zany and if you prefer comedy / romance or well-plotted comedies with deep characters, see L.A. Story instead, or When Harry Met Sally.If you like this, I suggest similar films Midnight Madness (1980), and Scavenger Hunt (1979) both of which are aging a little now but good for a rainy day, or as kid / family films.Who should see this film-- Everyone who likes a zany comedy, although there arebetter films out there if you're not a regular movie-goer.I'll give Rat Race a 7 out of 10.

Sinclair (John Cleese), and the rules are simple&#x97;whoever gets to the money first keeps it!The formula is as old as the hills, having started back in '63 with It's a Mad Mad Mad Mad World, and continued through the 60s, 70s and 80s with films like The Great Race, Those Magnificent Men in Their Flying Machines, The Cannonball Run and Scavenger Hunt; in less experienced hands, this kind of thing can easily fall flat on its face, but director Jerry Zucker is a man with a degree in zany from the University of Madcap, and with an incredible cast and a script that fires witty one-liners like a belt-fed machine gun, he delivers one of the finest ever examples of this comedy sub-genre.Of course, this kind of comedy is far from sophisticated, a relentless series of zany events and visual gags that escalate in madness as the competitors get closer and closer to their goal, and as such, it isn't going to appeal to everyone (people who think that The Royal Tenenbaums is funny, for example). On the other hand, those of us who can appreciate the magnificent sight of a cow suspended from a hot air balloon or the genius of a Jewish family mistakenly visiting a Klaus Barbie museum will have an absolute blast.Rowan Atkinson is absolutely brilliant as a Latin Mr. Bean with narcolepsy; Kathy Bates is unforgettable as the crazy squirrel woman; Whoopie Goldberg and Lanei Chapman break the land speed record in a rocket car (funnier than it sounds); Vince Vieluf and Seth Green play dumb beautifully; and Amy Smart has a great butt (I know that's not relevant to the comedy, but I just had to mention it).The film loses a point for a rather unsatisfying finalé (matters come to a head at a charity gig headlined by pop rockers Smashmouth&#x97;remember them?), but overall this is a fine comedy, one that benefits from excellent repeat value and a whole shed-load of quotable dialogue.

A mother (Whoopi Goldberg) is set to meet the daughter she gave up for adoption some twenty odd years ago. Two young punks are plotting to arrange a fall in a hotel, meriting a lawsuit. Also, an Italian gentleman (Rowan Atkinson) is enjoying his visit to America and a football referee (Cuba Gooding, Jr.) is hiding out from a bonehead call that was widely criticized. And, last but not least, a harried father (Jon Lovitz) is taking his family on a vacation in Vegas. All of these people play the slots and end up receiving a token to a special buffet luncheon. It is over lunch that they learn that there is a 2 million dollar fortune locked up in a train station locker in New Mexico and they are all being given keys. As the casino owner (John Cleese) explains, the first one to reach the locker will get the money. He shoots off a gun and the race is on! With the local airport shut down, these folks hop into cars, ambulances, helicopters, trains, and buses to try to capture the big bucks. Who will be victorious? This is an updated version of It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World that still dishes up truckloads of laughs. Just watch the goofy squirrel saleswoman (Kathy Bates) send folks to their doom or the creepy trip to the Klaus Barbie museum by Lovitz' family and you will be shaking with laughter. There are way too many happenings to list here but they all add up to a supreme gigglefest. The cast is a marvel, with the players listed above getting help from Amy Smart, Kathy Najimy, Dean Cain, Dave Thomas, Seth Green, Paul Rodriguez, Wayne Knight, and more.

Oh my gosh, I didn't know that this movie was sponsored by Nickelodeon! They want to share the money amongst themselves, but then they find out that they really should give it to the poor children who need it. Fair enough, if it can send a message, great, but don't you think they could have pulled it off a LITTLE better? Okay, so they give the money away. To end the movie, they tell everyone that John Cleese's character will match the money they donate...oooh....karma! And to top it all off, the competitors all sing All-Star with Smashmouth. I couldn't think of a worse group and/or song to end the movie with. Truly this is a sign of the Apocalypse.In short, you'll probably be better off watching this movie up until the very end.

No comedian worth his salt would resort to such tactics except to present to purile childish humour to an audience with an equal lack of intelligence.

Boy, some cinema critics *are* idiots! The only people who won't laugh seeing this film are those who think comedy is something Woody Allen does in his darkest moments. Those people never laugh with their bellies; at most, in their funniest moments, they smile with their mouths but not with their eyes.They complain that Rat Race is stupid, but, if one is a rocket scientist smart enough to understand the math behind quantum mechanics, one realizes that being funny is about being stupid. A joke is, by definition, an unexpected solution a stupid person found for an insoluble problem. Slapstick *is* funny, if done right. And they did it right here, everyone is always at danger of suffering considerable bodily harm, because of their stupid decisions. If the characters were smart enough to make the right decisions, it would be drama, not comedy. The characters' morals aren't the best, most of the transportation they use, ranging from a hot-air balloon to a supersonic rocket-car, is stolen. And most of them are trying to cause some harm most of the time, from a very botched attempt to sabotage an airport radar, to a helicopter pilot who tries to teach her boyfriend a lesson about fidelity, to the quite successful revenge of a frustrated squirrel salesperson. Even if it weren't for their questionable actions, normal parents wouldn't like their children to meet most of those characters in real life there are gamblers, neo-nazis, lesbian bikers, a football referee, a tranvestite Lucille Ball impersonator, and even attorneys. But, with very few bad words, just three jokes about sex and a couple others about toilets, this is about as clean as a film will be these days. Any parent that has objections to letting their children see Rat Race is suffering from a severe overprotection problem. "},{"Title":"I can't believe this movie is only number three!!!!

The extras did a wonderful job holding up Jon Lovitz!!!!I wish I could share second-hand the orgasmic glee I experienced while watching this movie, But I'm afraid you will have to see it for yourself. I'll just highlight my favorite elements*The chase/action scenes- so well done with perfectly timed humor interwoven with the action. I especially enjoyed Vince Vieluf and Seth Green's action sequences together. They should be giving props for doing some of the most unappreciated hard work in the movie business.*The sick screwball humor- from the flying cow, to the flying doo to the flying heart, this movie had me cracking up every second. A stand-out scene was Cuba Gooding Jr's hilarious description of his facetious wife's 'birth' (I swear, when I get this movie on tape I will rewind it to him saying Vagina in that creepy, panicked voice.) And every scene that featured Rowan Atkinson as a silly Italian man with a sleeping disorder had me busting a gut most painfully.*The subtle comments on our society-In a day of so many heavy-handed dramas on what is wrong with the world, sometimes it takes a screwball comedy to impress a wider audience. I loved the relationship between Whoopi Goldberg and Lanai Chapman's character's, from the little time they were on the screen you got a feeling for their differing value systems-One spends all her money to finally meet her daughter, squarely putting relationships before money, the other is clearly in it for the cash, not even stopping to talk with the nice lady who gave them directions to the short-cut to Silver City. (Well, she seemed nice;))*The love stories- Short and sweet. I thought Amy Smart and Nick Shaffer were so cute together, and Vince Vieluf was a scream showing off his piercings to the beautiful girl in the car beside him. If I get it on videotape I will most surely rewind it to the look on his face when she lifts her shirt and shows him her goodies. (only a side-view, don't worry parents)*The heart underneath it all- Yeah, the ending was a bit silly, and nobody needs to hear Hey now by Smash Mouth again in this life. (or any) But the characters end up so likable and the man who speaks for Feed The Children at the end gave me a real feeling of the seriousness of those with real problems in comparison with the silliness  that had ensued beforehand.

Together they create one laugh after another--a car climbing poll, a cow flying high, an air-ground war between a chopper and a truck, Hitler's car and a team of wealthy greedy bettors all will make you roar with laughter!

With people like John Cleese and Rowan Atkinson, I hoped for the best, although I must also admit that I'm not a fan of Whoopi Goldberg, which still made me doubt about it. However, I didn't see it as a reason not to watch this movie and that's why I gave this Rat Race a try.When a group of billionaires is searching for something new to bet on, they find the perfect solution for their 'problem' in the new game that Las Vegas casino owner Donald P. Sinclair has invented. He has pulled a group of six strangers together and tells them that they will have to race to Silver City, New Mexico, where the first one to arrive will be able to retrieve $2 million hidden in a locker. The only rule is that there are no rules. Everything is allowed in order to get there first. At first they don't really believe this is a true race, but it doesn't take long before the narcoleptic Italian immigrant, the desperate father, the disgraced NFL referee, the decent lawyer, a team made up by a mother and daughter and another one made up by two weird brothers all embark on this weird adventure.What I liked most about this comedy was that it didn't rely on all those fart jokes and other toilet humor that you find too often in today's comedies. This is still a movie full of decent jokes and I must say that I had some very good laughs with it. However, that doesn't mean that this was a perfect movie. Take for instance Rowan Atkinson. I normally like all his parts, but this time I was quite disappointed by his performance. I'm not saying that I know someone better to play the role of Enrico Pollini, but this certainly wasn't Atkinson's finest. On the other hand I must say that John Cleese was very nice as the eccentric casino owner.Overall this isn't the best comedy ever, but I like to see it as one of those guilty pleasures, which can sometimes lighten up a miserable day. The story is completely over-the-top and absurd, but that's OK, because this is a comedy. The acting is pretty good most of the time and especially John Cleese and Cuba Gooding Jr. were a nice surprise. That's why I give this movie a rating between 6.5/10 and 7/10.

Essentially a re-make of a 1963 film called It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World, it suffers from too little character development, and far too many stupid scenes that aren't very funny.The huge cast of stars, one of the film's biggest attractions, is also it's greatest liability. So many good comedic actors appear that the movie jumps around far too much to give any one of them nearly enough time to really satisfy the audience. Just when you're beginning to enjoy Rowan Atkinson's goofy Enrico Pollini character interacting with Wayne Knight, the shot jumps elsewhere. It felt too much like 5 or 6 movies that they jammed together into 1.Some of the silly comedy is a bit too silly (read stupid) to be believable as well. Why would Jon Lovitz's character say That's a nice dike (meaning to say bike) to a tough looking female on a Harley?

It is much better than It's a Mad, Mad... which was very much a 60s comedy, i.e. buffoonery was far more important than anything else. TRR has some of that, too, but for every far-too-silly gag that bombs there are several that don't. Cuba Gooding has two particularly weak moments in the scene when he fools the bus-driver into handing him his clothes ( too stupid to be funny), and when he throws a temper tantrum at the Lucys screaming that he isn't a real bus-driver ( unconvincing). Otherwise, most scenes work very well. The highlights the heart segments, the cow segments, squirrel grave-yard, and all the Hitler-related scenes. The movie moves at a brisk pace, much like a Looney Tunes cartoon. The good thing is that there are both good visual and verbal gags. It's a pity that Atkinson once again plays a Mr.Bean-like character, instead of showing how well he handles sarcastic characters, as in Black Adder 2-4. Mr. Bean just isn't funny; am I the only one to realize this?

It is about motivation and greed. A group of tycoons decide to stage a race where the winner receives a substantial amount of money. People are chosen pending upon those whom find a token in a slot machine. It involves various subplots climaxing with a worthwhile message. Director Jerry Zucker is at best with slapstick humour but this hardly rates up there with Top Secret or Airplane. Some scenes misfire such as the ladies getting into the jet, or a family attempting to communicate with Nazis using sign language. The ending does present a great twist with its message but few of the cast are really funny. Cuba Gooding Jr. is interesting as a former referee who cannot seem to live down a bad coin toss. Seth Green is also funny as a schemer who sees this race as an opportunity. Among the performances that are below par are Whoopi Goldberg who can be a great comic but she overacts in this film. Amy Smart is terrible as a helicopter pilot dealing with boyfriend issues. Rowan Atkinson shows up to waste our time with a Mr. Bean performance under a different name.

The gags and jokes come fast and heavy, much like Airplane which Jerry Zucker also had a hand in.  Sure, some of the jokes fall flat but there is always another one coming soon.The first 15 minutes or so are basically devoted to setting up the plot and introducing characters - I was asking myself when is something funny going to happen here, but in retrospect this was necessary in order to make the later gags work.  Often times a joke will be related to something that happened much earlier in the movie, so there is a constant element of surprise and recognition that makes it that much funnier.  Characters who are set up as nice normal people are revealed to be maniacs; this is a recurring theme and is very funny (I especially liked Amy Smart's pilot character).No, not everything works.  The ending is pretty hokey.  I didn't care much for Whoopi Goldberg's and Rowan Atkinson's characters but there is so much else going on that it doesn't seem much to matter.  A final comment is that this is a movie I could watch with my kids and not feel uncomfortable.

It's certainly not something I'd want to spend money to see  at the movies.Some of the scenes, such as the fate of those who don't buy squirrels and the scene with the cow and the balloon, are funny. Some of them are not, and because there are so many characters and we skip from one to another it is hard to remember or care much what is going on to each one of them. John Cleese is probably the best of a cast full of comedy stars who have done much better work. I'd say that it was better than average, but unfortunately the ending is lame - wincingly sentimental.

I remember seeing the preview and thinking it looked funny.  Having loved the Cannonball Run movies when it seemed like everyone else hated them and having also loved The Gumball Rally, Scavenger Hunt, and It's a Mad Mad Mad Mad World, I knew what to expect from this.  However, I wasn't expecting to laugh so hard, so often.  It all starts when a zany casino operator offers a bunch of idiots a chance to win $2million.  It's quite clear that the guy isn't playing with a full deck and at first everyone thinks that it's all just a ploy.  Pretty soon they're off and everyone's out to beat the next guy.  The laughs come so fast you're likely to end up rewinding and watching over, as I often did.  Of the group, I'd have to say that Seth Green and his brother got the most laughs out of me while Rowan Atkinson's Italian tourist character annoyed me to death.  I really did want to reach through the screen and strangle the guy.  I'd have at least like to have seen him catch a serious beating.  That's really my only complaint.  The rest of the movie had me in stitches.  The script is great and the stunts were incredible AND funny.  Two standouts had to be where the two brothers are tryint to tear down the radar and the scene where the cadillac is out of control and hits a rock, propelling the guy with the speech impediment fifty yards through the air, into a pond.  I must have watched that one scene at least a dozen times. Rat Race is good, low-brow, idiot comedy at its best and it was just what I needed.  It's worth more than one rental and I'm sure I'll end up buying the DVD.  I just hope that there's a sequel.

Director Jerry Zucker, who brought us Airplane! and Top Secret! (two of the most brilliant comedies of all time) has failed to capture any of the things that made those movies great.The film is about a group of outrageous people who are racing to get a two-million dollar prize.  The movie has a great cast and it seems like everyone is in it.  John Cleese, Cuba Gooding Jr., Rowan Atkinson and the rest, all do a great job.  They are all funny and quirky, but sadly, the film is not.The are some funny moments, such as when Dave Thomas's character has an interesting request for a prostitute.  You'll also crack up when the cow starts flying.  Most of the time though, you'll only chuckle, and your chuckles will end long before the scene does.  One example of this is when Amy Smart's character tries to taunt and attack her cheating ex-boyfriend while she's flying a helicopter.  It is funny for about half a minute, but after about five minutes of this, you want the scene -and the movie- to end.When you're at your local video story trying to find some suitable movie to rent, avoid this.  There are thousands of other movies out there that are better, funnier, and that don't make you regret sitting through them.

It doesn't.While some concepts are initially promising (a dumb guy who has trouble speaking because his tongue is pierced, an NFL referee who is hated by many after blowing a coin toss, a Jewish family man who hates Nazis so much he still won't buy a VW), the execution is dull. None of these characters really does anything especially funny. They are just quirky. And you spend a lot of time wondering at the set-ups, like why does this Jewish guy associate the VW with Nazis of 50 years ago? What exactly did the ref do that determined the outcome of a game if it was only a coin toss (wouldn't a blown call in the end zone make more sense?)? Why does this pierced tongue guy have trouble speaking when so many others with pierced tongues don't?Other characters are simply one-joke wonders (the actor who used to play Mr. Bean is a mugging narcoleptic) or just inexplicable (a career woman is traveling with her more laid back mom Whoopi Goldberg). The concept of a Lucy Impersonator Convention is worth a laugh the first time you see all the Lucy's, but repeated material that shows all the Lucy's crying like Lucy did when things went wrong gets old, fast.In the end, only the usually frenetic pace keeps Rat Race from becoming a bore. John Cleese and his group of unnamed gamblers who wager on almost anything is a funny bit. And if you like scatological humor, the concept of prairie dogging, which I had never before heard in this context, is a guaranteed laugh-out-loud moment.We gave Rat Race a 6, because it tried hard and because of Cleese. "}{"Title":"Really Funny Stuff","Date":"22 March 2002","Score":"","Genre":"Adventure, Comedy","Review":"  	Jerry Zucker is responsible (as writer, producer, or director) for some of the funniest movies of all time &#150; from the lewd, crude, and rude Kentucky Fried Movie, to Airplane, to the TV series Police Squad and its film spin-off Naked Gun.  Naked Gun's sequels began a comedic downfall, which continued for a decade, until 2001's Rat Race.	Rat Race is, quite simply, hilarious.  Like any Zucker film, its presentation is rapid-fire joke after joke, in totally unrealistic situations tied together by a plot thin enough to let them go off into absurdity but with just enough substance to be able to bring them back together at the end (and what a positive-vibed ending! I'd call it implausible but in this film that's a moot point.  It really does make one's day though).  Rat Race definitely has this down, as long as one checks their brain at the proverbial door.  Not every joke works, and most are surprisingly clean (but risky clean &#150; particularly a gag involving accidental Hitler impersonation at a WWII veteran's celebration), but the fact is most work, and this has one of the best laugh-to-joke ratios in a long time.  It even bests what I have seen of Zucker's earlier work (everything except Kentucky Fried Movie).	Though I personally thought the film was hilarious, it is easy to see the other side of the issue.  The reason these situations are so funny are because they come totally unexpected and totally absurd; knowing what happens I doubt I would laugh at it all again.  Some of the situations, upon close inspection, reveal themselves as annoying (Lucy's, I'm looking at you, though I realize they were intended to be annoying) or too stupid to work more than once (what's up with the squirrel lady?).  There never seems to be enough of the most enjoyable characters &#150; the brothers Seth Green and Vince Vieluf, and Mr. Bean.  Though these are valid points, they are the same points that can be made about any Zucker film.  For what it is, there are no major flaws with Rat Race, but if you don't like what it is, then you simply will not enjoy Rat Race.	It's difficult for me to review comedies because they're either funny or they're not.  If they're funny bravo, if not they're a failure.  Though I never tested to see how well it holds up through multiple viewings, Rat Race, thankfully, is funny for at least one viewing, and quite possibly more.

This only makes it even funnier and I was laughing so hard the entire time, I couldn't control myself.  True the humor was somewhat predictable but it wasn't entirely so but that fact made things even better when you know something will happen but you don't know exactly what it is.

Maybe what was missing was the edge of the original Airplane or the the first two Naked Gun flicks. I agree with those who found the ending of this film sticky and sentimental in the extreme. But my main objection is the attempt to substitute constant movement for comic inspiration. It's pretty sad when you can't even make such reliable comic performers as Cleese and Wayne Knight funny. Every time I saw Cleese I kept thinking that he must have a great dentist as those teeth were so white! I think this film needed a much better script and a more subversive attitude.

Instead of the dying words of Jimmy Durante guiding them to `the big W,' the group is sent on the chase by billionaire casino mogul Donald Sinclair (John Cleese), who (unbeknownst to them) is tracking their every move, while a bevy of high-rollers is betting on the winner.The cast is first-rate, with Cleese bringing his English polish and well-honed comedic skills to the production. As the movie continues, the wealthy patrons bet on everything from which flavor chocolate the lawyer will bite into in a box of candy, which maid can dangle from a curtain longest, which of the group will throw up first when Sinclair's private Leer pilot zigzags during a flight, etc.The assembled group of contestants is disparate enough. Jon Levitz is Randy Pear, a man who has finally agreed to take his family on vacation &#150; although it appears his real purpose in going to Las Vegas was not to see David Copperfield, as promised, but to hit the casino. The pudgy Pears (Levitz, Kathy Najimy Brody Smith and Jillian Marie) make a cute family and even look somewhat alike. When  Levitz decides to accept the invitation, he tells his family he has received a `once in a lifetime' job opportunity to sell fountain pen ink in Silver City &#150; and off they go.Whoopee Goldberg and Lanei Chapman play a mother and daughter, who have just been reunited after more than 25 years. They seem to have little in common at first, but suddenly have two million things that interest both!Seth Green and Vince Vieluf play Duane and Blaine Cody, a pair of dysfuntional brothers, out to make a quick buck. Duane (Green) is definitely `the brains' of this Two Stooge outfit. When Blaine (Vaieluf), who can barely be understood, thanks to a self-performed tongue-piercing, complains that he could break his neck faking a fall at the casino, Duane bravely replies `That's a risk I'm willing to take.'Upright young lawyer Nick Shaffer (Breckin Meyer), a clean-cut attorney with political ambitions, winds up flying with gorgeous helicopter pilot Tracy Faucet (Amy Smart), on the pretext of visiting his sister at the Silver Springs Hospital.Two individuals, meanwhile, are competing solo. NFL official Owen Templeton (Cuba Gooding, jr.) is a national scapegoat (especially in the South and in Vegas) after blowing a call that cost the Dallas Cowboys a game the previous weekend. Enrico Fellini (Rowan Atkinson of `Mr. Bean' fame) is the final contestant, bringing all his usual facial quirks and bizarre movements into play.The result is as much mayhem as one can imagine, with all the contestants, naturally arriving (more or less in one piece) in Silver City at basically the same time. In between, though, Zucker maintains the pace beautifully and what could easily become a tedious string of crashes and near-crashes is instead, enjoyable throughout.Everyone has a plan and &#150; naturally &#150; everyone's plan goes seriously awry. Nick sees his attractive copter pilot turn psycho when she discovers her boyfriend in a pool with another woman and destroys the copter and half of a suburb in her rage. Smart is stunningly attractive as Tracy and never more so than when she cackles sadistically as she chases her terrified boyfriend.Owen has one problem after another, first being stripped and dumped in the desert by an irate cab-driving Cowboys fan who lost thousands of dollars due to his officiating blunder. When he finally staggers into a service station, he cons a bus driver out of his uniform, only to discover that he is driving a busload of Lucille Ball wannabes to the Third Annual I Love Lucy Convention!Other than the copter, no one is flying, thanks to the Cody brothers and their bungled attempt to destroy the airport radar system. When the brothers decide to have duplicate key made and split up to increase their chances, the hardware store clerk overhears them and makes off with the key. He winds up dangling from a balloon &#150; along with a cow, all the way to Silver City.The mother-daughter combo have their problems, as well. Asking `the squirrel lady' (a delightful cameo by Kathy Bates) for directions without buying a squirrel can be fatal. It isn't for Vera and Merill, though, and neither is accidentally setting a land speed record in a rocket car.While Enrico, a narcoleptic, is falling asleep in the middle of airport terminals, the Pear family is having their own share of misadventures. When Randy finally gives into family pressure and stops so little Kimberly can visit the Barbie Museum, they discover to their horror at it is actually the Klaus Barbie Museum, dedicated to France's most hated WWII war criminal, and lovingly run by young skinheads. After finding their van sabotaged, they calmly swipe Hitler's Mercedes-Benz and get into even more hilarity.Zucker, working for one of the few times without his older brother David, brings home another winner, with the help of original Saturday Night Live writer Andrew Breckman. This is a good, relatively clean film and lots of fun. This probably the best comedy I've seen in several years.

Remember Cannonball Run and Cannonball Run II? I would have thought two VERY similar films about a race was enough! But apparently Jerry Zucker did not agree with me, and he felt the need to make a film containing the scenes that was refused for classics such as Airplane and the Naked gun movies. The film is not chemically free from good and enjoyable moments; David Sinclair, played by non other than John Cleese, and his lot of eccentric billionaire friends make up the most of these, but some very rare seconds of other laughable happenings also occur.

I am definately glad that I did pick up this little gem...it is simply hilarious. Zucker's greatest movie yet.The story revolves around a group of people at a Las Vegas Casino. After winning a certain coin in one of the slot machines, they find out that they have been chosen to race to New Mexico in search of $2 million. The first one to the cash...well, gets to keep the cash. Along the way, they meet all sorts of comic mishaps.Not slapstick like Zucker's previous films, this movie will delight both fans of his movies, and fans of the British comedy scene, as this film tends to lean into that direction more. I haven't laughed so hard in a long time as I did when I saw John Lovitz and his family visit the Barbie museum. And the scene with the WWII vets is just hysterical. I do not want to give too much away, you will have to watch it yourself.The film reminded me of an updated version of The Cannonball Run, however, with a funnier story.

The cleverness in this is it allows us to switch between six stories (5 sets of contestants and the gamblers) so that if you don't like one of them you're sure not to be stuck with them for too long before switching.Rat Race is good. Rat Race is funny often - if not all the time. Rowan Atkinson's character Enrico Pollini is particularly weak and tends just to act like a gaping moron in a most humourless fashion. Nick Shaffer (Breckin Meyer) is the plays-by-the-rules guy gone bad and is, as such, a bit dull though he's nicely balanced by the psychotic helicopter-flying Tracy Faucet (Amy Smart). Particularly good though are the Cody brothers - they get the best of the slapstick humour elements and add a bit of tomfoolery to the proceedings. However it's Randy Pear (Jon Lovitz) driving his family (literally) mad in his pursuit to win the prize that steals the show - watch out for the hilarious WWII veterans rally (the film's funniest moment).There's nothing special about the directing or the acting - there doesn't need to be. This film relies on a script and thankfully the script is able to keep up with the task. Sure there are plenty of weak moments (the I Love Lucy segment stank, as did most of Atkinson's role) but that's helped out by the fact we're constantly moving to the next gag - the film is not slow paced. Admittedly I guessed the type of ending (if not the exact nature) but that didn't spoil my enjoyment. By no means a classic comedy but great fun nonetheless - certainly a worthy way to spend a couple of hours at the cinema.

While each of these groups is playing slots, they receive a special token, which they redeem to the manager/owner of the casino/hotel (John Cleese). This random selection determines who races to go for the money.The twist however is that John Cleese's character has set up this race as a betting event for a bunch of high-dollar compulsive gamblers. To me, the funniest part of the movie was to see Cleese and company killing time betting on incredibly STUPID (read funny) stunts while waiting for their group to win the race. )The film is not without it's problems, just like pretty much any film.

The only thing to keep you on the edge of the seat at this point is the reflex to catch John Cleese's false teeth.It picks up again once the race is underway with things getting bigger, better, sillier and more tasteless as the movie progresses. Cuba Gooding Jnr looked desperately out of place and Whoopi Goldberg should have stayed at home. Seth Green, Vince Vieluf, Breckin Meyer, Amy Smart and Rowan Atkinson play the only characters of interest and make a good performance. All these characters had a lot more screen time and you wanted to go back to them while watching Whoopi, Cuba or Jon Lovitz. Dean Cain was supposedly in the film, but I missed him. I did see Lanai Chapman.The comedy was pretty silly and very tasteless, at least they didn't do any World Trade Tower gags. Vince's pierced tongue was quite a witty (and the only) piece of social commentary (made more funny near the end, but I don't want to give the joke away). Rowan plays a Bean-esque character, which fits in well, but I would rather have seen him play in a Black Adder style - however Seth Green already had the role of an absolute b*st*rd.Then you get to the end, which is very lame a disappointing. Given some of the jokes throughout the movie, the ending seems to be such a cop out. Smash Mouth put in an appearance (I thought it was Fred Durst until they introduced the band) and do one of their best songs.All in all, it is a good movie, just miss the beginning and miss the end.

This is *not* It's A Mad Mad Mad Mad World. It never aimed to be. Hell, if we started unfairly judging movies to other movies that might slightly resemble them, we'd be forever criticising movies - no matter how good or bad they were.Secondly, this shouldn't have been labelled a comedy. Yes, it was funny. In fact, the John Lovitz take on Hitler was utter hilarity, but apart from that, and a few lines from Whoopi Goldberg and Wayne Knight this movie wasn't overly funny. Never mind - it wasn't mighty entertaining.The colourful onscreen antics of the wacky racer characters were fun and like I said, entertaining to watch. I'd have called it a comic-thriller.

This movie might appeal to those who think that Adam Sandler is funny.  However, for some of us the film was not just bad - it was boring.  For the performers, though, this movie should be a source of chronic embarrassment.  Rowan Atkinson's role as an Italian-accented Mr. Bean-type character was abysmal.  Atkinson is getting worse as he gets older.  It's a shame that he seems to have peaked as a comedian in his 20's and to now be on the long, slippery slope to obscurity.  Such a shame.  The same might be said of John Cleese, except that it's hard to imagine him actually getting any worse.  How can he have allowed himself to have reached such a low ebb that absolutely nothing he says is even remotely humorous?  Both Cleese and Atkinson would have been better off had they stayed in England, but apparently the lure of Hollywood greenbacks was sufficient to overwhelm any remaining artistic ambitions they may have had.  They're now like punch-drunk fighters who used to be contenders, but who now keep climbing into the ring for another paycheck - and another beating.  I hope the pay is good.None of the other performances are worth noting either, though Jon Lovitz does at least give us the very occasional chuckle.  It's too bad he wasn't around to work for Mel Brooks, who could have made something of Lovitz' latent talents.  I don't know what Whoopi Goldberg is supposed to have contributed to this film.  She certainly isn't the least bit funny, and the same can be said of Cuba Gooding, Jr.'s performance.  I guess the movie's makers just showed him the money.  The remaining cast members are lesser-known obscuranties whose careers will certainly not be helped by appearing in this kind of drivel.

This comedy, on the other hand, plays like a 1 hour Monty Python sketch there are tons of recurring events throughout the film, or events that set a chain reaction of other events that lead to even further mayhem.The cast is over the top. Rowan Atkinson & John Cleese are two of the most dignified and funny men ever to grace the screen. Their charm and charisma is tremendous. The rest of the cast (Jon Lovitz, Whoopi Goldberg, Cuba Gooding Jr.) are hysterical, too. They manage to get into so many funny situations it's hard to keep count. Think a modern Airplane!. This is it.The movie drags a bit at first, playing like a bad comic flick. But it picks up steam by the 10th minute, and by the 15th, when John Cleese appears, it is a laugh riot.Also, let us not forget this seems to be an homage to the Canonball Run movies by Hal Needham. Both start in Las Vegas. Both have top notch acting. Both end up being road trip movies. This one (SPOILER!) shares a similar ending (not quite, though) with the first Canonball.But this one is a hell of a lot funnier. I'll never look at a cow the same way now. Terrific.

CauleyIn 1979, Scavenger Hunt hit the screens with comic greats like Richard Mulligan and Ruth Gordon leading a race to win an inheritance left by Old Mr. Parker.  A year later, Michael J. Fox made his film debut in Midnight Madness, about college students sent a scavenger hunt.  Neither movie lived up to their grand predecessor, the 1963 classic It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World.  Legends like Spencer Tracy, Milton Berle and Buddy Hackett lead a chase for a thief's last bounty in this classic adventure.  It's comedic brilliance has never been matched, until now.  The Rat Race combines talented comedic minds like Whoopi Goldberg, Rowan Atkinson and Jon Lovitz with some of today's most talented actors, Cuba Gooding Jr., Breckin Meyer and Lanei Chapman, not to mention classic comedic masters like John Cleese and Dave Thomas.  The laughs are literally unending in this madcap race.The setting is Las Vegas, Donald Sinclair's (Cleese) Casino has seen hard times so its clever proprietor has devised new ways for its high rolling clients to amuse themselves.  One scheme involves six teams of random slot winners racing to Silver City, New Mexico to unlock locker number 001 at the train station to retrieve a prize of $2 million.  The first team is Nick Shaffer (Meyer) who later meets up with helicopter pilot Tracy Faucet (Amy Smart).  Next is Owen Templeton (Gooding), an NFL referee who managed to screw up an opening coin toss at a Dallas football game, costing a lot people in Vegas a lot of money.  Meanwhile, the Cody brothers, Seth Green and Vince Vieluf, are up to no good trying scam themselves into a law suit with the casino.  Blaine Cody (Vieluf) recently pierced his own tongue and cannot speak correctly so it's up to Duane (Green) to lead the duo in the chase and wreak havoc along the way.Golberg plays Vera Baker, a woman meeting the daughter she put up for adoption for the first time, Merril Jennings (Chapman).  Their run in with Kathy Bates who plays a squirrel salesman is classic.  If you've seen the trailer, you haven't seen it all.  Next, Randy Pear (Lovitz) leads his family, wife Bev (Kathy Najimy) and kids, Jason (Brody Smith) and Kimberly (Jillian Marie) in the charge under the pretense of having a job interview in Silver City.  The Pear family and the Cody brothers hog a lot of the chuckles in The Rat Race.  Finally, there is Atkinson who plays Enrico Pollini, a narcoleptic from Naples, Italy who heads out solo on his journey but soon meets up with Wayne Knight, who plays a delivery man.  These six teams are brought together by little gold coins that say You're a winner, see Guest Services for a spectacular once in a lifetime opportunity. That opportunity is The Rat Race.Once the participants are convinced this opportunity is real, the race is on.  First off, The Cody brothers manage to sabotage the main route of transportation, Owen hooks up with a bus full of Lucille Ball impersonators and Tracy finds her boyfriend in a compromising position leaving her available to pursue Nick. One of the most hilarious components of the film is the banter between Randy Pear and his family, one conversation particular, involving a prairie dog, is not to be missed.  The entire theater was in hysterics during this bit so I will not spoil it for you.  Their side trip to the Barbie Museum is also laugh-out-loud funny.  The insanity and the laughter continue throughout the course of the race.  In the process, one Lucy is set on fire, one team is ripped off, the Pear family has to run for their lives and a flying cow is used as a weapon, leaving devastation in its tracks.Dave Thomas deserves honorable mention for his role as Sinclair's lawyer. Also look for cameos by Paul Rodriguez who plays a disgruntled cabby/gambler, Dean Cain as Tracy's boyfriend and even attorney, Gloria Allred, as herself.  When Nick tries to persuade Tracy to participate in the contest, he reveals what his grandpa always said  Good things take time, great things happen all at once.  The Rat Race happens all at once and it will knock your socks off.  You will leave the theater holding your stomach and reveling in the fact that the most deserving party got the money in the end.  The Rat Race proves it truly is a mad, mad, mad, mad world.

"}{"Title":"CU Film Critic takes on Rat Race.","Date":"17 October 2001","Score":"","Genre":"Adventure, Comedy","Review":"   For quite some time now, I've held that a truly good movie consists of more than just a cameo by a trendy rock band, star power, and jokes about excrement.  With the recent release of `Rat Race,' this supposition has once again been proven.It's a great idea, in theory.  Take some of Hollywood's biggest comic names, and send them on a cross-country (or cross-New Mexico, as the case may be) road trip; the only necessary motivation is a hefty cash prize.  Logically, it follows that hilarity would ensue.I should point out that this formula can and does work.  1963's `It's a Mad Mad Mad Mad World' starred Sid Caesar, Spencer Tracy, Milton Berle, Buddy Hackett, Jonathan Winters, Michey Rooney, and Ethel Merman, to name a few. They all went out looking for treasure, and the result was pure comedic gold.Where did `Rat Race' go wrong?  Well, for starters, instead of the biggest names in comedy, we are forced to settle for young up-and-coming pop stars, Omar Gooding's older brother, and a few stand-up comics who recently started hitting rough times.  Instead of Williams, Hanks, Sandler, Tucker, and Stiller, we get Goldberg, Green, Gooding, Cleese, Atkinson, and Lovitz. Now, that's not to say that `Rat Race' isn't a funny movie.  I laughed out loud quite a few times.  Taken in short segments, `Rat Race' is hilarious, just as we'd expect from a screenplay produced by a former Saturday Night Live writer.  Maybe it would be great as a series of skits on a big-budget variety show, but as a movie, it falls flat on its face.Is it worth watching?  Yes, if you've got a large group of people to see it with, and you don't mind dropping six or seven bucks to slack off for a couple hours.  Here are my observations, just in case you decide to give it a shot.Vince Vieluf is funny.  Seth Green and Cuba Gooding Jr. are not.  Kathy Najimy is funny.  Whoopi Godberg is not.  Amy Smart is attractive.  Rowan Atkinson is not.  Jon Lovitz, for all intents and purposes, makes `Rat Race' almost worth the price of admission.  If for no other reason, see the movie just to see Jon Lovitz steal Adolph Hitler's car, and your money won't have been wasted.Sadly, though, even with the help of the fat guy from Seinfeld, Jon Lovitz can't save the movie from being anything but mediocre summer movie fare. Kathy Bates, arguably the most talented actress around, is wasted on a part reminiscent of her `Momma' in `The Waterboy.'  It won't do me any good to give any background on the characters, because when it comes down to it, nothing really matters but the fact that all six contestants want to win some money.  Some great characterization could have been put to use in this sort of road-trip film, but it seems that the screenwriter fell asleep on the job.`Rat Race' gets a good solid `C.'  Not good by any means, but certainly not the worst.  If you can spot Dean Cain in a fun cameo, you've got my respect, and hey, who doesn't want that?

Jerry Zucker, the co-creator of explosively funny comedies Airplane! and The Naked Gun, directs. Rat Race is pretty much a hit-and-miss affair. It isn't nearly as funny as Zucker's two earlier hit comedies (it also isn't as funny as another comedy Zucker co-directed, Ruthless People), but the film does have its share of laughs. Rat Race doesn't have as big of an all-star cast as It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World did, but it does have a big cast nevertheless, and most of them come off funny. Whoopi Goldberg, John Cleese, Cuba Gooding Jr., Jon Lovitz, Kathy Najimy, Seth Green, Breckin Meyer, Amy Smart, and (in a hysterical cameo) Kathy Bates are all fun to watch and seem to be having a good time. The only character that I didn't like was that Italian guy played by British comic Rowan Atkinson. This was one of the most unfunny characters that I've ever seen in movie history. I didn't laugh at Atkinson's character once. If this character had been taken out, Rat Race would have been better.

I can only assume that they completely lacked any contribution to anything, because I felt like I started in at the beginning.  Not that this lack of contribution would have hampered the film -- I truly enjoyed Rat Race for its comedic glory.  If the production team's desire was to simply entertain they did their job superbly; yet if they wanted to create a novel piece of art that would contribute to the intelligence of all humankind, they failed miserably.The very basic and very simple plot of Rat Race is that Donald Sinclair, a Las Vegas tycoon and casino owner, sets up a contest to be played by several select gamblers with the best odds ever.  A bag with two millions dollars has been placed in a locker in Silver City, New Mexico.  With odds of six to one, the lucky contestants embark on a slapstick journey to their hopeful fortune.  Unknown to them, the entire race is being watched by other players who have bet on the winner.Lost completely from the characters is any deliberate, or even accidental, form of complication or engagement.  The cast is comprised completely of stock characters.  This adds for a multiple of laughs, but in the long run, one can only listen to a man with a speech impediment because of a self-inflicted tongue ring for about ten minutes max before wanting to tear his tongue out of his mouth.  Probably the most complicated character of the lot was Tracy Faucet, portrayed by Amy Smart.  From her we receive the most background information.  We learn about her family.  We find out that she has a relationship with someone who is secretly cheating on her.  We discover her profession and how she came to get there.  Her personal story starts far ahead of any other character in the show.  This is a sharp contrast to Grishman, Sinclair's run around man, who we know no more about at the beginning than we do at the end.After much deliberation with one's self, it is possible to pull a worthwhile theme from the movie.  In short, the best way to achieve any goal is not through competition but cooperation.  The characters contemplate this option only briefly at the beginning of the story only to be overcome by the desire to win a full two million dollars.  They discover their downfall after someone else has stolen the money and they join forces to get it back. It is debatable as to whether or not they actually realize they should have cooperated at the beginning since they never actually say this, but they at least deserve the benefit of the doubt.  The movie's cheesy end has them forced to give up their newly won money to a charity for starving children. This action only accentuates the overall importance of cooperation and sharing that drives the story.Returning to the plot, it is highly episodic.  So much that it seems like sketch comedy.  This glorified SNL feeling again provides for many laughs but detracts from any bit of intelligence that might have been present. Each scene explores with greater depth exactly what each character would do to arrive at their destination first.  After each incident one can see the subconscious of each mind come to grips with reality and conclude that they have made rather uneducated and thoughtless decisions.Not often does one leave a theater in a state of greater stupidity than which they arrived.  In relation Rat Race I do not believe one could have left more stupid (though one could easily imagine the sound of brain cells dying in the audience); it is possible though for the stupidest of the stupidest people to gain nothing from the show.  Anyone with only a sliver of intelligence can ascertain the simple idea that drives the story and leave with at least a small amount of reflection (and a huge conception of wasted time).

To see John Cleese with Teeth that Mat Dillon used to wear was funny. The ongoing betting scenes were very funny. The characters covered the spectrum. Oscar winners and new kids in the movie business all worked well together.  Too many funny scenes to count.  Amy Smart is such a fox.

Jerry Zucker's hilarious chase caper Rat Race is just such a film, and after a summer of big-budget, self-serious piffle, boy, did we need it.The film is a throwback to those all-star '60s and '70s comedies in which a gang of celebs chase after a treasure or other wonderful prize (the template for these films is the classic It's a Mad Mad Mad Mad World).  It begins in Las Vegas, with six strangers chosen at random by an eccentric casino owner (John Cleese, sporting gleaming false teeth) to go after $2 million in cash stashed in a train-station locker in Silver City, New Mexico.  The only rule?  There are no rules!  So it's off they go, by any means necessary, to beat the other rats and grab the big cheese.  That's pretty much it.  Screenwriter Andy Breckman (a veteran of the David Letterman show) doesn't clutter his story with a lot of subplots, and we barely learn anything about some of the characters.  Still, that doesn't stop us from enjoying the craziness that strikes all of them on their dash for the cash.A upstanding young lawyer (Breckin Meyer) gets his first taste of the wild life as he goes for the gold with the help of a sexy young pilot (Amy Smart) who teaches us that hell hath no fury like a woman scorned who can also fly a helicopter.  Two con-artist brothers (Seth Green, Vince Vieluf) smash up every car they get their hands on and then get a taste of their own medicine  when they crash into a demolition derby.  A disgraced NFL referee (Cuba Gooding, Jr.) finds himself driving a busload of Lucille Ball impersonators.  A narcoleptic Italian (Rowan Atkinson) learns that you shouldn't play games with somebody's heart...literally.  An estranged mother and daughter (Whoopi Goldberg, Lanai Chapman) should have bought a squirrel.  And as for Jon Lovitz, whose subplot provides the film's most explosive laughs?  I don't want to give anything away.  Suffice it to say that if you're ever in the southwest, and you see a sign for the Barbie Museum, just keep driving. This is a lot of stuff for any film, and Rat Race clocks in at 112 minutes, hefty for a comedy.  Still, Zucker keeps the action and laughs barrelling along at a breakneck pace, and the story only really bogs down during Goldberg and Chapman's scenes.  This subplot provides the fewest laughs and could probably been eliminated.  Atkinson's loony Italian accent and absurd personality spank his scenes along beautifully.  Meyer and Smart display a free and fun chemistry (not surprising, considering they are, unless I'm mistaken, a real-life couple).  Gooding has a surprising gift for zany comic breakdown, Cleese is appropriately loud and nasty, and Green and Vieluf throw themselves into their smash-up comedy with gusto.  Lovitz, in some ways, has it easy.  He's got the best material in the film, so he can just sit back and let the script do the work.After two years of teen comedies in which flying body fluids matter more than setup and punch (and if the success of American Pie 2 is any indication, this is an era that is not soon going to end), it is a great pleasure to see a comedy that revels in the elegant and difficult art of building, detonating and sustaining a joke.  Breckman sometimes sets up jokes that don't pay off until a half-hour into the film, lines and moments feed off of one another in a fast-break comic circle, and Zucker keeps it all crackling along with such confidence that the payoffs, when they come, seem both unexpected and inevitable.  The picture is edited to turn on a dime, and Zucker is clearly a man who knows his way around a camera; one of the funniest moments is a long super-slo-mo shot of Green and Vieluf desperately trying to escape from their car as a monster truck bears down on them.  See the film, picture the same shot in regular time, and you'll know what I mean.Rat Race bogs down somewhat at the end with a feel-good finale that goes on too long.  Still, as far as laughs, nasty laughs, good-natured laughs, bang-up laughs, just plain laughs, Rat Race is THE film to see right now.  Forget the apes.  This summer, it's all about the rats.

Sure, tactless and offensive, but what wasn't.  The only joke that was just to gross to be funny was 'prairie-dogging it'.  Only people who I would say don't see this movie to are people who get offended easily.Ok, even I'll admit it, the plot sucked.  A bunch of people race to Silver City in order to get 2 million dollars.  But with as many jokes and fast-paced action the plot really isn't the big deal you would think it would be.

I wasn't trying to be mean, I was just getting tired of all the Mad Mad Mad Mad World puns. Sorry for being a bit hostile to some other reviewers.Second, I noticed some other things and I'd like to make a point. At least one person said that this movie didn't have as much of a what-will-they-do-for-that-money feel as in It's a Mad Mad Mad Mad World, but it's more about the characters getting into wacky situations. A few people said they didn't like the ending, and at least one said that it was out of place for a movie about how ruthless people can be when there is lots of money involved.I think these two comments answer each other. I think some people are forgetting, while this is partially a remake of IaMMMMW, this is not IaMMMMW. Perhaps Rat Race is less about people's greed. Perhaps Rat Race centralizes more on satirizing what people will endure for so much money, not what acts people will commit for so much money. Or perhaps Rat Race is not really about anything, but it's just a summer movie looking to earn some dough. Whatever. Made me laugh either way.

Just because you don't find someone's review witty doesn't mean you have the right to bash it.  This is not a flame board.  There are plenty of other places on the Web for that.  You can politely refer to someone else's review, but insult that person through their review is downright rude. Chill, have some dip, move on.And with that note, on to the REAL review.When I saw the previews for this, I will admit that I thought it looked like a cute movie.  However, after the very amusing and impressive opening credits had finished, I was in for a very unhappy surprise.  Although I have never seen the original It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World, I'm assuming by the way it is considered a classic that it holds much more wit and charm than Rat Race.  While most of the acting was laboured, Rowan Atkinson and John Cleese both wasted their talents in this movie and I'm still trying to figure out WHY men of such acting brilliance would fall for such a farce.  The only GOOD acting I could find in the movie was that of Kathy Bates playing the psychotic Squirrel Lady.  Honourable mention goes to Wayne Knight playing the ambulance driver.The jokes where unfunny and I really don't remember laughing much to any of them.  They seemed to have been written for folks with an IQ of five (no offense to anyone, mind you), although it appeared that they tried to give the film culture with classical music and opera at key scenes.  Unfortunately, I enjoyed these brief interludes of music better than the film and could have stayed home with my own CD collection.  There wasn't much laughing during the visit to the Barbie museum, but then again, I saw the movie in a predominantly Jewish neighbourhood.  A bus full of Lucy impersonators would be enough to drive me insane, even IF one of them was the token humourous gay guy.  And the brother with the botched DIY tongue piercing was funny to begin with, but the gag wore off pretty fast.  I will admit that Amy Smart's way with dealing with a cheating boyfriend was pretty amusing and had me thinking, Hmm, maybe I should take up helicopter lessons!.All in all, if you saw the preview, you saw the highlights of the movie.  If you really don't care to see who gets the money in the end, save your own.

Mad World is a classic film featuring some of the best comedians of all time (Spencer Tracy, Buddy Hackett, Mickey Rooney, and many others). Sorry, but the cast of Rat Race doesn't even come close. Before you write me off as an old geezer stuck in the past, I should point out that I'm 23 years old.Mad World is over three hours of comedy performed by the best comedians of the day. Compare that to Rat Race which is an hour and a half and it's most note worthy comedian is Lovitz with a huge drop-off after that. The only thing that disgusts me more than a pathetic remake such as this is the fact that nobody realizes it's a pathetic remake.Before you plop down eight bucks to see this movie, I urge you to go rent It's a Mad Mad Mad Mad World for only 3 - you won't regret it.

You've got all-time British comedian Rowan Atkinson, popularly known as Mr. Bean.  You've got Whoopi Goldberg, who has acted in Sister Act and the sequel.  I do not know the rest of the cast, but they look funny anyway!This movie is about this owner of a casino-hotel in Las Vegas who was kind of bored, so made a once-in-a-lifetime race, using selected lucky people from the hotel.  Their main task is to get to Silver City to open the locker with US$2,000,000 inside!  All of them went different hilarious and crazy routes to get to Silver City, but ended up giving the money to charity to help the children.  The movie ends off with Smash Mouth performing All Star live, which was good, because this song is great and I think even the audience feels great about it!I think this movie is worth the money, because of the way that the movie is portrayed.  The movie will never leave you bored at any part because there is something funny and crazy in every part.  Also, this story has a good moral.  The moral of the story is not to be too materialistic about life and not to be too selfish and self-centred and to learn to give readily to the needed.  I think most of us have good lives, but some people out there are suffering and struggling.  The ending really made me think about my life, like the way I spend my money and the way I waste my food sometimes... it really makes you think.Overall, it is one of the most entertaining movie I've seen.

You've got six different tracks constantly competing and raising the stakes, as well as 'breather' comic relief from Don Sinclair's million-dollar play-time parties.  There's no part of the movie where you could escape for a bathroom break and miss an incredibly hilarious pay-off.Although the film is over-the-top, that's all part of its charm.  The shock humor works so well that you won't have many problems suspending your disbelief for long enough to laugh in pity at the competitors on screen.

Also with a large ensemble cast you run the risk of having the characters become indistinguishable from each other, or of having over the top caricatures that wear thin in a hurry.  That didn't happen here. Seth Greene and Vince Vieluf were especially good, and the combination of Lanei Chapman as a driven yuppie and Whoppi Goldberg as her sweet natured long lost mother worked perfectly.  Rowan Atkinson would have become annoying if he were given more screen time, but as one of many in a large cast his character was quite funny and made a great contribution.  My only quibble with this movie was that the ending didn't seem quite right.  Without giving away what happens, I'll say that I think the writers got to the end and didn't know what to do, and in my opinion the result looked like a car running out of gas.  Despite that, I was laughing very hard through most of this movie as was the audience I saw it with.

It looked like a lot of fun.  I was hesitant, however, because the trailer seemed to show an awful lot of very funny over-the-top bits.  A friend went to see it last night and told me nothing about the movie except 1) It was hilarious and 2) the trailer _didn't_ include some of the funniest parts of the movie.So, after reading a few reviews here and avoiding spoilers at all costs, I went to see it tonight.  I gotta say, I'm so glad I went.  My friend was right, there were a lot of other great scenes!I hate it when people tell me about a movie before I go see it, so I'll not reveal anything here.  The cast was a great blend of characters, and I really can't pick a favorite.  They all had their high points.  One of the side bets that was made was truly off the wall and really reminded me of classic Abrams, Zucker, and Zucker stuff that we saw see in Airplane, Top Secret, or Naked Gun.  You know, the weird, completely off-plot stuff that happened in the background that made you watch the movie again and again to see more and more of it...  but I digress...The bits that were in the trailer were funny, but didn't have quite the impact after having seen them a dozen times already.

"},{"Title":"Development and Payoff","Date":"21 August 2001","Score":"","Genre":"Adventure, Comedy","Review":"  Rat Race really is, in spirit, a retread of the old classic 'Its a mad, mad, Mad, Mad World'. However, that older movie was one fairly realistic situation after another, with each being a commentary on how basically decent people behave when tempted by greed. The newer film, on the other hand, shifts its focus to a more slapstick angle, with one huge buildup and payoff gag followed by another. And that buildup is the key to this movies success.....without it, the actual punchlines (read 'payoff') would seem trivial and not funny. Many people in the theatre during the showing I saw suffered from this. They sat and talked during the buildups, and then snapped their attention back to the screen during the slapstick parts, but seemed disappointed at the end; they did not find the payoffs funny. In spite of their rude behavior, I was able for the most part to pay attention to the succession of seemingly throwaway details which finally came together and made the payoffs funny in a sustained, sidesplitting way.No, this is not a great comedy, and if one expects the wall to wall gag-a-minute 'Naked Gun' type laughs, there will be disappointment. This movie has probably a dozen really good laughs, each following the slow buildup, and those little details can be important.I also noticed the low-key subplot, which involves the mini-bets the gamblers place while waiting for the big gamble to resolve. Many of these were inspired. "},{"Title":"One of the best","Date":"21 August 2001","Score":"","Genre":"Adventure, Comedy","Review":"  This movie is one of the best I have seen in a long time.

The truth is I started laughing as soon as it came on. The credits are amusing with the entire cast as cut out cartoons with a strange calypso tune in the background.  There were some small parts where the jokes dragged a little bit and the timing was too slow, and the ending doesn't give a big enough pay-off for a hilarious movie. For the most part though, I would laugh for 5 minutes wait for another set-up and laugh for 5 minutes more.

Although it doesn't have the aggregated star power of its spiritual ancestor, Rat Race does manage to do what IAMMMMW couldn't do. It manages to spend enough time with various characters to make them interesting. At times, the on-screen business and sight gags are as zany as that classic Zucker experience (Airplane!). Some jokes are foreshadowed far enough in advance that, even though you see them coming, you savor the moment (I KNEW that was going to happen, but it's even funnier than I envisioned!).Don't expect any major character development or breakthroughs. Even though the characters are interesting to watch, they are merely the modern equivalents of stock characters from commedia del arte. Their motivation is a mere setup for the stage business and the entire purpose of the characterization is to slap you with the occasional sucker punch (I feel sorry for the poor slob, but he sure does deserve it!).Rat Race won't make anyone's Top Movies of All Time listings, but it sure does entertain.

Not only is 'Rat Race' the funniest film of the year, it is quite possibly the funniest film of all time.  Audiences don't seem to care about real comedies anymore. Those damn sex comedies have replaced them and most of them don't deliver real laughs. Now comes 'Rat Race', a movie that plays and acts like a remake of the 1963 epic comedy 'It's A Mad Mad Mad Mad World', which was directed by Stanley Kramer. 'Rat Race' was directed by Jerry Zucker from a script by Andrew Breckman and thanks to great writing and great direction, 'Rat Race' is one uproariously funny movie.  So what's it about? Six people win on slot machines and they receive a coin that says You're a winner. Come to Guest Services. They are sent up to a penthouse where we meet Donald Sinclair (John Cleese). He offers them a chance to win $2,000,000. These people include Owen Templeton(Cuba Gooding Jr.), Enrico Pollini(Rowan Atkinson), Randy Peer (Jon Lovitz), Nick Schaefer(Breckin Meyer), Duane Cody (Seth Green  and a woman named Vera(Whoopi Goldberg). At first, they're not interested, but once they chase each other down the stairs (briliantly to the song Who Let The Dogs Out by Baha Man), the race begins. No more of the plot will be given because it deals with sub plots on all six teams. There are also more and more characters in the story.  The movie also has stand out scenes featuring Seth Green and Vince Vieluf. Most of their scenes are very funny.  But if you think the last scene is going to be set in a hospital like in 'Mad World', you are dead wrong. Despite how funny the movie is, the ending might get a mixed review. I won't give it away due to the fact that I promised no spoilers, just crtique and part of the plot. Just see the movie for yourself.  If you see one movie on the weekend of August 17-19, see 'Rat Race'. It's better than going to see 'American Pie 2', 'Captain Correli's Mandolin' and 'American Outlaws'. The movie is rated PG-13 and parents, bring the kids. This is the funniest movie of the year and quite possibly the funniest movie of all time. Don't miss it. If you miss it, you will be sorry.

This movie, however, can be described in chat room lingo as a ROTFLMAO movie (Rolling On The Floor Laughing My Ass Off)  There is a little bit of crude humor, a lot of slapstick that actually works (just imagine the cow in Twister and then get even weirder), not too much bad language, and fish out of water situations  (the Barbie museum----I won't give it away, but your sides will hurt because of this part, I guarantee)that gel perfectly into about 100 minutes of non-stop laughter. Veteran comedic actors John Cleese and Jon Lovitz take irony to new levels, and physical comedians like Rowan Atkinson flourish without completely taking over scenes.  So what's it about? Similar to It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World, a group of random and very diverse individuals find themselves racing each other to find a fortune in an obscure desert location.  The major differences in the story are that instead of having the money bequeathed by a dying gangster (mad world's Jimmy Durante), the race is a game set up by casino owner John Cleese, who we learn has set up the contest as a betting forum for international high rollers, who will wager thousands of dollars on anything, including which of the investors will get airsick first......but I digress.  The other major difference is the ending.  In mad world, the principals all ended up in the hospital, bemoaning their fate and regretting their greed.  In this modern gem, the principals all end up together as well, but----Naw, you've just got to see it yourself.  In short, this is THE FUNNIEST MOVIE OF THE YEAR, PERHAPS THE LAST FIVE YEARS.

It seems through my movie going experience when I see a preview over and over again, the movie doesn't end up being worth it.The theatre held about 175 people, and 18 of those seats were for press, so needless to say some people got turned away.  Just a bit of advice, get there early, you can't get there five minutes before and expect to get a good seat.  The passes don't say first come first serve for nothing.  The movie started about five minutes late.The movie starts off like a cartoon, sort of.  The opening credits have the cast in cartoon characters, which I thought was pretty funny.  Then it jumps to Vegas.  Numerous people that have never met each other find themselves in the same casino and play slot machines.  When they win, they get a coin that states you are a winner, come to guest services.  So, once there, they are led to a conference room where we met Donald Sinclair (John Cleese) who is the owner of the casino.  At this point, we met Nick Shaffer (Breckin Meyer), Vera Baker (Whoppi Goldberg), Merrill Jennings (Lanei Chapman), the Cody brothers (Vince Vieluf and Seth Green), Owen Templeton (Cuba Gooding Jr.), the Pear family (Jon Lovitz, Kathy Najimy, Brode Smith and Jilliam Marie) and Enrico Pollini (Rowan Atkinson).  Grishman is played by Dave Thomas who is Sinclair's run around person.  Once Sinclair explains to everyone that the object is to get to Silver City, New Mexico and find a locker number 0001 and they will find two million dollars, let the fireworks begin.One of the sub-plots is Owen was a football referee that blew a coin flip in a game in Dallas recently and everyone in Vegas knows about it because they put hundreds of dollars on the game.  When he leaves the casino, he gets in a taxi in which the driver realizes this and gives him a hard time. Another sub-plot is when Nick is trying to get out of the hotel, he meets Tracy Faucet (Amy Smart) who we find out is a helicopter pilot and decides to give Nick a life to New Mexico.  Why does he take this, because the Cody brothers break the control tower at the airport.There are so funny scenes that I won't spoil them all here, but this movie is a lot better than I expected.  Some of it is predicable, but the ending is nothing you would expect.  I don't think a better cast could have been picked for this.  The logic behind the PG-13 is some language and partial nudity.

The scenes with the rich spectators are the funniest in this very disappointing film. There are so many annoying parts in this very wayward screw-ball comedy that I would have to watch Rat Race all over again just so that I could list them all off. Atkinson's character was plain annoying, while Goldberg and Cuba Gooding Jr, both goods comedy actors, were disappointing. The most annoying characters though were those played by John Lovitz and Kathy Najimy.Watching so many credible actors, including Oscar winners, wade through this debacle of a film is embarrassing.

This was the best that a talented cast of actors could do?, well if that's true then I find that very sad indeed. There's way too much going on for the movie to really have much of a point, but here's a summary. Seven people are given the chance to win $2 million, all they have to do is go to Silver City, New Mexico, and open a locker at the local station. This 'game' of sorts is organized by a wealthy casino owner (John Cleese) who hopes that this new game of his will provide him and his business partners with plenty of money (you see while these seven are trying to get to the money, a lot of rich people are betting on who will get there first). This is one of the few interesting parts of the film, everything else just isn't funny, Cuba Gooding Jr. seems to suffer the worst as he gets humiliated in scene after scene, the few that he's actually in that is. Jon Lovitz also looks like he's just collecting a paycheck, as does Whoopi Goldberg. Rowan Atkinson (Mr. Bean) is about the only funny part of the film but even he can't provide a lot of on screen laughs, mostly just groans.   The movie's main problem is it tries to cram too much into 2 hours, all of the actors barely get any screen time, which didn't make me really care what happened to any of them. I know it's a screwball comedy that's not meant to be taken seriously, but it has to at least be funny and well Rat Race wasn't by a long shot. This 'race' was over before it began, -** stars.

Or rather that human group dynamics define seven stereotypes around which people invent themselves. Here's a test to see which you are. There are seven types of comedy here the six competitors/teams, and the betters. The strategy with films like this is to shuffle between types of comedy to keep the pace moving. The full range of comedy cannot be accommodated, but there are seven different types here. Same as Mad, Mad.My own favorite is Cuba and his Lucies, including the explanation of why he needed the uniform and leading up to the big W `You wuined our wacation.' Its because it is mildly self-referential a busload of comic impersonators -- and because Gooding's acting is an odd take on comedy. He plays it straight, but straight in a dizzy world where everything is pushed into Wiley Coyote territory (just like Lucy) his comedic acting is noncomic acting pushed past the limit. In a real sense, he is goofing (in a friendly way I'm sure) on the professional comics. The only two old pros here Goldberg and Cleese, are the least funny of the bunch, which just emphasizes the point.The other interesting thing for me was the producer's icon for the new Fireworks productions (new to film anyway). These are the often annoying snippets that are shown before you start to get your money's worth, being a sort of letterhead of sponsoring organizations.They are representative of that sponsor, their approach to quality and often some philosophy about the business. Dreamworks is one everyone knows a combination of Normal Rockwell and mystical magic, strictly visual. Some of the others are absolutely dreadful. These are like a printer's brochure, or an architect's office -- they should be done well.This one is done well. It is visually stunning and gets the message across cleanly and quickly. There is a fireworks effect done with bombs punctuating `ordinary' bursts. The bombs establish a cadence long enough for it to register on your senses. Then it smoothly accelerates in a way you can track. Then it outpaces your ability to recognize a pattern and breaks into seeming chaos. (Developed by BoomBoom Bamboni if I have it right.) Thrilling, because you know it was all planned, that it affected you through that plan, but that you couldn't comprehend the order of it all. This is conveyed in the Fireworks clip in about ten seconds. Fireworks is a group to watch.

A group of random people with their own, unamuzing, eccentricities, suddenly depart Las Vegas after being told of the location of a safe containing vast sums of cash. The first one to get there gets the loot. It's all part of some stupid contest organised by Cleese.

There is only one vital ingredient missing from these various sketches comedy.In fact, towards the end of the film, I actually became convinced that this was an inside joke. That is, Whoopi, Cuba, Cleese, all these big names, got together and said hey - let's make a film touted as a comedy that really isn't funny and has the most intellectually devoid storyline in the history of movie making.

But if this was a genuine attempt at comedy, I fart in your general direction. On the comedy side of things, this film sets low standards and fails to achieve them.At the end of the film, the cast ends up realising that there is more to life than just money, such as humanity. I rolled my eyes so hard that they nearly did a 360. As soon as the credits started rolling, I exerted the full force of my 300 pound weight on the DVD, shattering it into tiny pieces.

I could not have been more wrong.  Sometimes when you watch a movie you're disappointed because your expectations are too high, or because you're just not in the right mood to appreciate that sort of film.  Those excuses don't apply here though, because I was in the mood for a lighthearted comedy, and my only expectation was that it should be funny.This movie should never have been released.  It's the most unfunny rubbish I've ever seen, and an incredible waste of a talented cast; John Cleese, Rowan Atkinson and Whoopi Goldberg just to mention three actors that probably wake up every night in a cold sweat wishing they'd never agreed to be in this trash.The plot, such as it is, is this  A wealthy Las Vegas casino owner (played by John Cleese) comes up with a scheme to entertain his high-rollers.  He places six special tokens in his slot machines, then gathers the six winners together in one room and tells them he's sending them on a race to recover $2 million dollars which is stored in a locker in the train station of some remote little town.  The only rule, he tells them, is that there are no rules.  The first person there wins the money.  It's actually a decent premise for a movie like this, along the same lines as Cannonball Run.Unfortunately, the script feels like it was put together by a bunch of 10 year old boys locked in a room and fed red cordial and speed until they went spastic.  I certainly don't mind unusual, absurd or unrealistic situations in a comedy, but that's not the problem here.  The problem is that the director has relied on slapstick and visual gags, and has telegraphed the punchline of almost every single joke.  It was so predictable and banal in its stupidity that I was literally uttering the characters next lines in advance during some parts of the movie.There were a few funny moments.  Cleese's character and his high-rolling gamblers will bet on anything, and the setups for their wagers were generally funny.  There were one or two other gags that I laughed at, but so often a funny moment was spoilt by dragging it out far too long, or setting it up so transparently that you were over it by the time it arrived.I wanted to turn it off, but I was hoping desperately that it would improve. Instead it got steadily worse as the film progressed, until it all culminated in the most sickly sweet and preachy ending I've seen in years. I think it says a lot that I laughed more during the two minute blooper reel on the DVD than during the movie.Do yourself a favour and skip this movie, or recommend it to your worst enemies.

Reason being from sheer curiosity- curiosity to see if its creative team would literally remake the legendary all-star extravaganza from 1963 with all the MADs in its title. As it turned out, they did not. Zucker and company keep the fortune-hunting plot point from the original film but basically change everything else- from the reason the principals are brought together in the first place (SPOILER, sort of); a special jackpot won in a Vegas casino (instead of a dying thief's giveaway) to the film's finish (let's just say they shoot for the high road; I won't give away how). Of course there are reviewers of this film who find the nobility annoying and cloying, but such is the outlook of cynics. I liked and actually preferred this film's more upbeat ending than the all-for-nothing life lesson in MAD4 (ironically, a genius comedy for most of its 155 minutes only to become very heavy towards the end with all principal characters- shall we say- less than victorious. What fun.). As far as this film's own merit goes director Jerry Zucker takes the huge cast through some amazing adventures, and the real challenge is finding your favorites the mother-daughter team of Whoopi Goldberg and Lanai Chapman being led through the desert by maniacal squirrel peddler Kathy Bates; Cuba Gooding and the busload of Lucys; John Cleese (and those teeth!); Rowan (BEAN) Atkinson doing just about anything; or perhaps the film's comic centerpiece- brothers Seth Green and Vince Vieluf. The scene of then chasing a balloon while being chased by a runaway convertible (and then crashing into a cow) defies description. The DVD's companion documentary acknowledges the warm, family-like atmosphere generated by the cast of comics, but strangely, does not recognize (unless I'm mistaken) the film's 1963 predecessor anywhere.

Then I loaded this one into the VCR and laughed myself stupid for almost two hours. Jeez, it's funny. A cast of performers hasn't worked this hard, or been this well-cast, for a very long time. As a big fan of one of the Zucker brothers' forgotten projects (the completely zany Elvis vs the Nazis spoof TOP SECRET), I was delighted to find that Jerry Zucker has revived that style of wacked-out, off-the-wall, joyously surreal comedy for the 21st century. This from the man who directed the excruciating GHOST. Great to see he finally got his sense of humour back.Although the plot is little more than a very loose riff on Stanley Kramer's IT'S A MAD, MAD, MAD, MAD WORLD, this film ultimately scores several points over the sixties classic by virtue of its sheer pace and the near-hysterical sense of escalating madness it conveys. And the performers really work their socks off (Cuba Gooding Jr ruined a hamstring, Seth Green did that amazing stunt with the runaway car for real, and nobody's afraid of making a complete fool of him or herself, whereas the cast of Kramer's film seemed too often to be sleepwalking through something they obviously signed up to for a few laughs), so even the least sympathetic characters end up winning your grudging admiration.

Nick Shafer tries to check out, but denies accusations from the desk clerk that he repeatedly watched a porno film. Also in this hotel was Owen Templeton, a football referee who called a bonehead play and ruined in the game, causing many people to be angry at him; a woman, Vera Baker, was going to be reunited with her daughter, Merrill, for the first time in 28 years; Randy Pear was on vacation with his family; and, bumbling con artists Duane and Blaine Cody, were trying to scam some cash. Blaine's speech was always slurred due to he pierced his own tongue; Now what do all these people have in common? Absolutely nothing, except they all played a slot machine and won a coin that told them to go upstairs to a meeting. So they all gathered there. Soon, in came another person who won a coin, Enrico Pollini, who was, well, wasn't playing with a full deck, so to speak. Soon, in comes Donald Sinclair, wealthy business man. He tells them of a prize to be won. In Silver City, New Mexico at the train station in locker #001, was two million dollars! It was a race! Whoever got there first would win. Now neither Duane, Blaine, Owen, Randy, Nick, Enrico, Vera or Merrill seemed interested at first but soon they all bolted for the door and headed to the airport, except for Nick who chose not to go for it.Duane and Blaine couldn't get a plane ticket so they tried to destroy the airport radar to stop all flights and they painfully succeed. So, Vera and Merrill rent a car, Randy and his family take their van, Duane and Blaine steal another car, Enrico falls asleep due to he's narcoleptic, Owen takes a cab, but the driver was bitter due to Owen's bonehead play so he left him stranded in the desert; Vera and Merrill run afoul of a hillbilly lady selling squirrels. She tried to sell them one but they were uninterested so she pointed them down a road that causes them to fly off a cliff and onto a pile of cars of other people who wouldn't buy squirrels; Nick meets Tracy Faucet at the airport, who could still fly because her craft is a helicopter and the ride goes great until she finds her boyfriend cheating on her so she tries to get even. The helicopter breaks down so they steal his truck; Owen commendears a bus filled with Lucy Ricardo imperonaters going to an I Love Lucy convention; Enrico awakens and hitches a ride with a man transporting a heart to New Mexico. Trouble arises when they open the cooler to take a peak at it. The results find the heart flying out the window and when going to retrieve it, Enrico is whisked away by a train.Donald Sinclair and his friends monitor the race progress and wage all sorts of meaningless bets; Vera and Merrill commendear a rocket car; Duane and Blaine run into many misfortunes and end up stealing a big foot truck; Randy and his family visit a Barbie museum, which wasn't Barbie the doll, but Klaus Barbie the Nazi. Duane and Blaine sabotage their van so the Pears borrow Hitler's car and run afoul of a motorcycle gang. But finally, all the parties arrive in Silver City and get the money and end up at a Smash Mouth benefit concert. He thought they were donating that money to charity but before they had a chance to explain, the head of the charity gave thanks so they put their money in the basket and rocked along with Smash Mouth.A real funny movie!

I make him watch David Lynch films and all sorts of obscure indie stuff (I recently forced URBANIA on him), so I felt I owed him an innocuous Hollywood product.I didn't want to hurt his feelings, so I saved my bitching for y'alls. Yeah, RAT RACE has its moments, but a great deal of it irritated me. Let's start at the beginning.  RAT RACE was marketed as a family film, so I was a little surprised to discover that the first scene centered around a porno movie.  (I can hear it now  Mommy, what does AFRO WHORES mean?)  This scene has no purpose in this movie other than to cram some naughtiness into a PG-13 movie.And while we're still on the segments in the casino, it's pretty convenient that all the characters happened to play, within the same time frame, the slots that held the gold coins.  What would have happened if they didn't? Would those millionaire gamblers just sit around and wait?  And how did they get those gold coins in the slots in the first place?But I'm belaboring a plot point that's necessary for the movie to exist, so I'll press on.  About Whoopi and her long-lost daughter they're meeting for the very first time, yet throughout their whole ordeal they don't discuss with each other anything about themselves.  Why make their relationship such a presumably complicated one?  Couldn't they have just been, say, a mother and daughter on vacation together?  Why the business concerning a long-ago adoption?  And why portray the daughter as a hard driving career woman chained to her cell phone who never again needs contact with her business? Did the screenplay just forget about this subplot and character trait?This illustrates the main weakness of this movie - the characters are inconsistent and interchangeable;  it's exhausting when everyone is equally zany and with no identifying traits.  And another thing - the events aren't plausible.  Oh, sure, the characters can do some quirky things, but the characters themselves have to be believable.  Take THE NAKED GUN (another Jerry Zucker movie) for example.  Frank Drebin has some pretty exaggerated moments, but everything he does is, in theory, possible in his world. (Jane is also funny, but it's a different kind of funny, which makes all the difference.)  A character in RAT RACE defying natural laws by leaping onto a speeding train destroys any plausibility the movie may have; these clearly aren't real people, so why should I care about them?Another problem I have with RAT RACE is a moral one.  The characters obtain their modes of transport almost totally by theft.  I know, I know, this is just a silly comedy, and the same actions didn't bother me fifteen years ago when I saw MILLION DOLLAR MYSTERY, but there's a lot of lawbreaking in RAT RACE, and it bothers me now.  And I won't delve into the whole airport-sabotage sequence other than to wonder if the screenwriters didn't consider the real-life implications of such an action; was that scene funny before 9/11?I'll skip over the distasteful bits concerning the heart, the drugging of one's family and the Nazis (whose buildup and payoff worked better in an episode of Seinfeld), and move on to complain about the acting.  Rowan Atkinson started out annoying and ended insufferable; I don't know when I liked a comical character less.  And the three Oscar winners need new agents.  Whoopi came off best, but she didn't have much to work with (loved the copper perm and purple lipstick though); Kathy Bates' part was shrill but mercifully brief; Cuba, was...oh, man.  Cuba, babe, please fire your agent!  Following INSTINCT and CHILL FACTOR, this is your third strike (be glad I haven't seen PEARL HARBOR or SNOW DOGS) - it's time to give your '97 Best Supporting Actor Oscar back to its rightful owner (Edward Norton, for PRIMAL FEAR).  An actor of your stature has no business running half-naked through the desert and being checked out by a transvestite Lucille Ball impersonator.  Do you even read the scripts to your movies anymore, or are you reaching into a bag and pulling your next project out at random?There's other small points that bother me (how did Grisham and the hooker get to the loot so fast?), but, basically, RAT RACE amounts to little more than your basic batch of character types being hindered by arbitrary obstacles on their way to a rather underwhelming and inexplicable ending. They give the money to charity?  What kind of ending is that?!?  Yeah, it's the noble thing to do. Never mind the probability of cross-promotion/licensing whores Smash Mouth (do they ever say no to selling out?) putting on a benefit concert in the middle of the New Mexico desert, but who would honestly do such a thing?  Yes, they say it's the journey, not the destination, that makes a trip worthwhile, but there's no journey without a destination.  If there was ever an example of a wrong happy ending, this would be it.  What a bummer end to a movie that, despite my nitpicking here, I did enjoy parts of (I confess to enjoying the bit with the cow and some of the Lucy stuff along with the character with the tongue piercing - at first I thought his indecipherable speech would run me up a wall, but he grew to be my favorite).But as far as my boyfriend knows, I found RAT RACE quite funny and charming.

I gotta see that!? And then when you actually do see it, it's nothing like your expectations? It actually EXCEEDS them? Well, Rat Race is that kind of movie!From the opening credits, when those goofy little cutouts of the cast are dancing around and beating each other up, I knew we were in for a treat. And what a treat it was... one that built up with each laugh, each scene, making you want more, more, more, until the climax at the very end where we see that these screwballs are really great people after all.Now, first off, I would like to note that this movie would NOT have been so great if I had not watched it with our TV Guardian (which is a handy little machine that filters out bad language by reading the closed captioning). I can tell from the many times that the TV momentarily muted out that the language in this movie is quite heavy, but if you have the capability to watch it without hearing the cussing I say go for it! However, just so nobody gets the wrong idea, there ARE a couple of things that credit a quick averting of the eyes.Anyway, now that I have my moral problems with this movie out of the way, I can continue with my review! I was so impressed by the immense talent of this cast- John Cleese, Whoopi Goldberg, Breckin Meyer, Kathy Najimy, Jon Lovitz, Cuba Gooding, Jr., Rowan Atkinson, and yes, even Seth Green were all magnificent. Their excellent portrayals of these completely whacked-out people somewhat make you wonder what their real personal lives are like! And the star cameos, such as Dean Cain, Paul Rodriguez, Wayne Knight, and the always great Kathy Bates, were done to hilarious lunatic perfection.One thing that really struck me about the way this movie was done was that each team had so many mini-adventures... and each was funnier than the last! Randy and Bev and the kids visiting the Barbie museum, stealing Hitler's car, and crashing the WWII vet reunion; Vera and Merril's ride on the rocket car, trip with the mentally ill, and scafuffle with the Squirrel Lady; Enrico's sleeping problem, his ride with the EMT and chase after the heart, and his bug-like splatting on the train... the list goes on and on.  Normally, it seems like in a movie such as this, after every excursion the characters go on, the movie looses something of its charm and originality. Not in this one! The exact opposite is true here... every time they sidestep danger, we wait expactantly to see what will happen next... and each adventure is always better than the last one.I'd have to say that my favorite scenes were on the bus full of Lucy impersonators. I have always been a big Lucille Ball fan and the idea of having an entire bus full of Lucys was a stroke of true genius. The part when they all start crying like Lucy (Waaaaaaaaah!!!) cracked me up. Also, as I'm sure you can guess by the title of this review, I really enjoyed the Kathy Bates character and subsequent crash down the cliff. And of course, who could forget one of the greatest running gags in comedy history... the cow and the balloon. Boy, I sure would like to shake the hand of whoever thought that up.Anyway, all in all, it was a pretty great movie, full of memorable characters and impressive performances. I really liked the ending, too. Altho some people have said it was preachy or too contrived, I say it was the best way to close out what had been two hours of nonstop riotous laughter. And the ending shot, where the cast is being held up by the audience in the concert... priceless!! However, the inappropriate language and the other things (Randy and Bev's accidental signal to the biker, Harold's rather inappropriate request to Vicky, and the Pierced Girl's... um... unshyness) prohibit me from giving this a perfect 10 rating.

Here they are racing from Las Vegas to Silver City in New Mexico where a prize of two million dollars awaits the winner. The race has been organised by Casino owner John Cleese who, unbeknownst to the racers is running a book with a bunch of high-stakes gamblers as to who will win. The racers were decided randomly and include very different people; a disgraced football referee, a family on vacation, a narcoleptic Italian, a mother who has only just reunited with her daughter, a lawyer and a couple of dubious characters. The obvious method of transport is put out of commission as all planes are cancelled after an amusing attempt to prevent other racers; this means they must go by land&#x85; apart from the lawyer who befriends a helicopter pilot&#x85; it is just a pity for him she decides to say hello to her cheating boyfriend on the way.

Like all good film fans, they love to share their best film experiences with others who they know will love it as much as they do.

Rat Race is disappointing from the very beginning, because it starts off by showing four or five of the exact scenes that we already saw in the preview and that have therefore lost all effectiveness. This is not a movie based on reality &#150; there can really be no question that even the most eccentric of casino owners would never seriously consider picking a bunch of random gamblers out of their casinos and sending them off on this all-expenses-paid excursion to find a duffle bag containing two million dollars. Sure, these casino guys are all ridiculously rich, but Rat Race doesn't acknowledge the fact that rich people didn't get rich by giving money away. There is no financial return at all in the rat race portrayed here, or even any publicity!(spoilers &#150; but does it really matter?) Rat Race is filled with actors who delivered goofy performances that are far below both their iconography and their reputations as actors. Cuba Gooding Jr. - after great performances in infinitely superior films like As Good As It Gets, Jerry Maguire, Outbreak, and A Few Good Men &#150; performs several idiotic and humiliating skits throughout the course of this horribly disappointing movie. John Cleese manages to deliver some of the only funny lines in the entire film through his comical dentures, but still sinks far below his talent in this borefest. Other bad career choices were made by Seth Green, Amy Smart, and even the more negligible actors, such as Whoopi Goldberg, Rowan Atkinson, and Jon Lovitz. Seth Green, actually, is mostly in a bad role by association. His brother in the film is one of the dumbest characters I've ever seen in a movie, and his disgusting tongue piercing only serves to enhance his tremendous stupidity. I've had my tongue double-pierced since early 1997, have made little to no changes in my oral hygiene, and have never had an infection. If his tongue was that infected, it is entirely a result of his own idiocy (as we soon learn, with the realization that his piercing is self-inflicted), and therefore commands no sympathy or respect. If he wants sympathy, Major Payne can explain to him where to find it. Incidentally, the way he met a girl on the freeway (who shows up later at the Smash Mouth concert) was a shocking move to an even lower level.The movie goes wrong at the very beginning. It's clear that a mass travel to a single location is not the foundation of a good comedy, so they decided to throw in this ludicrous scene where Duane Cody (Seth Green) and his idiot brother get their jeep dragged up the sonar station at the airport in an attempt to ground all flights so that their opponents will not be able to fly to the location of the money (and if they had caught their flight in the first place, the movie would have been over in minutes and we would all have been spared). So at the expense of their remaining means of travel, they have successfully drowned out radio airwaves and grounded all flights. It's too bad the movie was released so soon, because if they had waited until after the September 11 terrorist attacks, the scene would almost certainly have been changed, and the movie could only have been better. This is one of the most moronic scenes in the entire movie, which makes you wonder why they didn't just have Cleese's character add in a stipulation that all transportation must be done on the ground. If the movie had been set for release after the catastrophic terrorist attacks, and they had decided to remove the scene, such a stipulation is almost certainly the thing that they would have decided on, both because it would be the fastest and cheapest replacement, but also because such a tragic event would surely make them realize how foolish the scene was to begin with.While Rat Race manages to avoid sinking to the abysmal level of other ludicrous comedies like the Scary Movies, it is clearly a mindless film that does not quite manage to redeem itself by having at least one or two things in it that can be taken seriously enough for it to be funny. The movie is bad enough even without the appearance of Smash Mouth at the end of the film, who are playing a concert for the poor. The way that all of the contestants in the movie stumble on stage with their newfound wealth at the end of the flim (I typed that accidentally just now, but it strikes me as a better word&#133;), ultimately deciding to donate it to the poor, is both insulting and disappointing. Sure, it would be a bad idea to make a movie that did nothing but promote greed, but all that time and effort by the characters as well as the audience is completely wasted (this is also one of the many things that ruined Titanic). It certainly is a good cause, but it is entirely uninteresting. You'd think that the virtually endless possibilities of the cinema would have inspired the film's writer (or writers, could there possibly have been more than one?) to come up with something more creative than this. In reality, donating to the poor, especially such a huge amount of money, is truly honorable and earns you a well-deserved interview and article in the newspaper. In the movies, it is a cheap way to get out of being accused of advertising greed, and winds up as little more than a boring end to a bad movie.

Personally, I think that no movie can equal the latter. So, as long as this one doesn't actually try to ape that one, it comes out pretty good. Once again portraying a gaggle of people in a wild race to try and find an exorbitant amount of money, the movie is mostly an excuse to be silly, not really focusing on greed the way that IAMMMMW did.Ignoring that, it's basically a litany of hilarity. Whether it's John Cleese's slimy weirdo, Rowan Atkinson's narcoleptic Italian (why didn't they cast Roberto Benigni in that role?), Jon Lovitz in Hitler's car, Cuba Gooding Jr. driving a most unusual bus, Whoopi Goldberg learning a lesson about squirrels, or something else, they just go all out here.

I don't care if this was a remake because this is a great movie.All of the jokes really played out well and I don't remember any jokes that weren't funny. The Barbie museum was such an incredibly hilarious joke. One of the best situational comedy moments EVER. I absolutely love Jon Lovitz character in the movie because he is just a regular guy in a dead end job who wants the money and he'll do anything for it. The Hitler joke was such a well played joke, I couldn't stop laughing.Whoopi Goldburg's character and her daughter were probably the least favorite of the bunch gunning for the money but still played a great part in the movie providing some funny jokes. Her breaking on the bus was so relatable.Rowan Atkinsons character was so incredibly funny. He provided some of the greatest one liners I've seen. Look, a drifter, let's kill him. Had me laughing so hard! I just can't list all of the GREAT moments of this movie. Some people may moan about the ending but it didn't hurt the movie at all, it was a great way to end the movie. The whole movie was pretty fluid through the whole thing and everything made sense. It never really had you asking Well, why didn't they do this? or Why did they do that?.This goes on my list of the most underrated movies ever right next to Harold and Kumar Go To White Castle and Kung Pow Enter The Fist.

Yes I distinctly found the original one of the most painful and discomforting movies ever. I'd like to process a civil suit against those responsible. It's that bad.This is slightly better, for the humour is fresher. Sort of. At least in the beginning. At least when Amy Smart is on screen. Just don't expect too much - not even from her. As far as I am concerned, the only thing interesting about it is Amy Smart. OK, and the Jon Lovitz family too. Because they're so totally gross. John Cleese wouldn't win an award for what he did here, and considering the quality writing he himself has done in the past, this is way beneath him.It's not ten laughs a second - it's a wee chuckle every five or ten minutes. If you have absolutely nothing to do, you will survive; but if you think of anything better, don't hesitate and don't turn back. This movie will be fine without you.And the sooner you run, the better. For it gets geometrically worse with time.Actually there is one demographic for which this work of art may be ideal someone who 1) has lived all their lives at Winnebago Acres; and 2) thinks Dukes of Hazzard is high brow comedy.

Admittedly, it's been many years since I watched the Mad, but I seem to remember the wacky situations the hunters found themselves weren't half as contrived, and so twice as funny. Rat Race has 'screenwriters had a hoot writing this one' written all over it. But the laughs don't really translate to the screen. There are one or two quite good jokes &#151; a stereotypical Jewish family visit the Barbie Museum at daughter's insistence, only to find it is a museum in memory of that nasty Nazi Klaus Barbie and later take off in Hitler's limo. It's a gag only producers called Zucker could get away with, and to say it was contrived is being kind. But it was reasonably funny, as was the conceit that some people will bet on anything, even the price a hooker will charge for very outlandish services. Shame there were not more jokes like that, however much they are in bad taste. The rest of the film is though short on laughs unless you're desperate.

The first time, I thought it was pretty lame to begin with but eventually got better. It improved with a second viewing. After that, I learned that it was loosely a remake of It's a Mad Mad Mad Mad World, a 1963 comedy which I had never heard of before. After finally watching that film last month, I watched Rat Race again last night. This time, I was not quite as impressed as I was before, and like probably many other viewers, I think its predecessor is superior. I still laughed quite a few times during my third viewing, mind you.Donald P. Sinclair is a billionaire hotel casino owner in Las Vegas who has a whole group of billionaire associates, looking for something to bet on. Six gold coins are placed in different slot machines, and the gamblers who find them are brought together and told by Sinclair about $2 million hidden in a locker in Silver City, New Mexico! They are sent on a race from Vegas to Silver City, and whoever makes it to the locker first wins the money! Odds of winning are 1 in 6. Participants in this race are the Cody brothers (Duane and Blaine), Owen Templeton, Enrico Pollini, the Pear family, Vera Baker and her daughter, Merrill Jennings (whom she put up for adoption as a baby), and Nick Schaffer and his new girlfriend, Tracy Faucet. Mayhem ensues as each of these parties finds themselves on a different adventure, in bizarre situations! Meanwhile, Sinclair and his associates keep track of the racers and make their bets! During my third viewing, it looked fairly promising around the beginning, with Nick Schaffer (Breckin Meyer) being billed for porn films he claims he didn't watch. This part made me laugh, but a lot of other scenes around the beginning disappointed me. The film's introduction to Vera Baker and Merrill Jennings is rather tedious and not that funny, and perhaps it takes a little too long for the race to begin. Even after it does, there are some lame jokes, most notably Kimberly Pear (the Pear daughter, played by Jillian Marie) in the car, talking about how she has to go number 2. Blaine Cody's (Vince Vieluf) speech impediment caused by his recent tongue piercing isn't the worst comedy idea I know of, but definitely not the best. However, there are also a number of very funny parts, with some of the situations Randy Pear (Jon Lovitz) gets into with his family, how Owen Templeton gets a bus driver to give him his clothes, the Deep Voiced Lucy, Enrico Pollini's (Rowan Atkinson) adventure with medical services driver Zack Mallozzi (Wayne Knight) and the human heart, etc. Because of gags like this, I can say that despite the dull moments, at least I laughed, which is more than I can say about SOME comedies I've seen in recent years.The plot of Rat Race is the same basic idea as that of It's a Mad Mad Mad Mad World, with a bunch of people letting their greed get the best of them, on a mayhem-filled race, with different people in different sorts of trouble, all for a hidden fortune! Also, like the film that inspired it, this movie features an ensemble cast. Of course, it is LOOSELY a remake of the 1963 comedy, so there are some differences, such as what starts the race, a different set of characters, different (but equally bizarre) situations the characters find themselves in, and in this film, it's not the police who are keeping track of the racers. The humour isn't quite the same, either. The kind of sexual and toilet humour featured in this film was obviously unheard of in 1963 Hollywood. The only unfortunate difference between the two films is that this one isn't as funny. However, if you like slapstick and silliness, and also like or at least don't mind some crude humour (this is not a family movie), you may or may not like this film, or you could find it to be a mixed blessing, like I did during my last viewing.

The few fun moments just cannot drag this work into the realm of enjoyable. Amusing, idiotic, well-cast, but inane.All in all? This goes with the others of its ilk Dude, Where's My Car?, Saving Silverman, and Road Trip. It's not terrible, but definitely not worth the time it takes to view it, unless you are an Immortal.It rates a 4.5/10 from...the Fiend .

Having said that, once the idea behind the race was set up, I felt that the film did start to pick up the pace within the first half-hour or so. There was much energy generated by the rush to start the race. I think a lot can be communicated with visual comedy. John Cleese's self-confessed eccentric personality went perfectly with the manic grin he wore at the start of the film. Equally, Rowan Atkinson's facial expressions are just right for generating visual humour, and he is also physically very funny - watching him dance at the end of the film was priceless and the crowd his character Enrico gathers when (being narcoleptic) he falls asleep standing up in the middle of a hotel was brilliant. Sometimes I think that you could give Rowan Atkinson a ball of string and he'd still be funny, and his accent in Rat Race also suits his his appearance very well.There were many instances - Where the hell's the airport? and the airline pilots' heads crashing into each other - that made me recognise that here was the work of one of the directors of the Naked Gun films. The You should have bought a squirrel sequence is another of these moments - it's that sort of comedy. The fight where two characters squirt each other with milk straight from the cow reminded me so much of the fight in Naked Gun 2 1/2 with the electric toothbrush and the hairdryer. It also struck me that many of the extras in the film - the girl who destroys her cheating boyfriend's house from the vantage point of a helicopter, the squirrel lady and perhaps even some of those participating in the I Love Lucy convention - are really quite mad. There are also a fair few unexpected twists in the story - the Barbie museum scene and even the end of the film were two bits I certainly didn't see coming. On a more musical note, I have never heard so much classical music in a comedy film of this type, but I have to add that I always thought Grieg's In The Hall Of The Mountain King was a perfect piece of music for any scene where you need to make a character look stealthy. An excerpt from La Traviata also gets a look in.

Some ordinary people use gambling slot machines and some manage to win a special coin. They go to where the coin instructs and then Donald Sinclair (named after the man who inspired Basil Fawlty, and played by John Cleese) is explaining about a town called Silver City in New Mexico. He then gives a bunch of ordinary people six identical keys that open a locker to $2,000,000. Basically, the first to get to the cash is the one who keeps it. Then when the pistol is fired the race begins. Many wacky and hilarious things happen to these racers. Enrico Pollini (Rowan Atkinson) is hit by a car by Wayne Knight, and survives. Vera Baker (Whoopi Goldberg) and her daughter Merrill Jennings (Lanai Chapman) drive a rocket car that can travel at Mach-one speed. Owen Templeton (Cuba Gooding Jr.) drives a bus full of women dressed as Lucille Ball/Lucy Ricardo. Duane Cody (Seth Green) and his brother Blaine (Vince Vieluf) strap a cow to a hot air balloon. Nick Schaffer (Road Trip's Breckin Meyer) gets tossed about in a helicopter by Tracy Faucet (Road Trip's Amy Smart) trying to kill her boyfriend (Dean Cain). Finally, Randy Pear (Jon Lovitz) gets his wife (Kathy Najimy) and kids into trouble speaking and looking like Hitler, and they stole his car.

I never thought I would ever say this I laughed, I cried, I peed myself and I thoroughly enjoyed Rat Race. Its real genius is not in the premise itself, although that one was good enough for that other famous film. It is in the details, the acting and enthusiasm of every single participant. Vince Vieluf is a stand-out as this century's definitive lovable idiot and at least on a par with Rowan Atkinson. John Cleese shines in his interpretation of - of all things - an American. Jon Lovitz' family is actually believable as victims of circumstance and go above and beyond the call of duty (pardon the pun) to get a laugh. Cuba Gooding Jr. is at his most athletic, which is saying a lot. But a special Oscar should have been offered to Whoopi Goldberg for attempting a part that is absolutely against type a sentimental, polite, retiring, naïve, soft-spoken and even-tempered soul to whom terrible things happen without ever affecting her sunny disposition. She and her daughter got the biggest laughs from yours truly, as did the cameo appearance of another Oscar winner who shall go unnamed so as not to spoil the fun.

The classic 1963 It's a Mad Mad Mad Mad World was due to be updated, and in my opinion, this is a fair update. One of the things that made MMMM World work was its huge assemblage of popular talent and comics, even small cameos. Here, you have a small group and very few added characters to the chase. In the original, lots of gags that hit every time; here, you have hits and misses, almost as many misses as you have hits. The Nazi Barbie Museum and the heart being the two biggest misses. Another big miss was when the two brothers ended up in the big wheel rally, and realized a big wheel truck was about to pound on them, they scattered out the car door, which took more time to do than simply put the car in gear and drive away from where they parked. The mumble-mouthed brother could have been in reference to Buddy Hacket's vocal style in the original movie, but if so, I think it's insulting.But with all its faults, RAT RACE is still a funny movie -- a one-timer for me -- with my favorite scene being the helicopter girl flies over her boyfriend's house. I haven't laughed so hard since Airplane! My favorite line was when after John Cleese told them Go! and everyone's still seated, he says, All of you have been racing for 45 seconds, and this guy is in the lead because he's the closest to the door.

I cannot say that this film is altogether terrible, but it is probably the most over the top live action film I have ever seen, and 'looney tunes' cartoons would seem to be a considerable influence.

Rat Race does one thing tremendously well and that is it never stops trying.  I don't think I have seen a film where almost every scene has the potential to be funny.  Many and most comedies just take their linear route and go from point A to point B and try to put in some humourous situations along the way.  Well Rat Race is ubiquitous in it's attempt to humour us.  Every scene is ripe with potential and I would only guess that if this is your type of comedy, then you will enjoy this film.  There is everything from Jon Lovitz inadvertently looking and sounding like Hitler just as he ends up on stage in a WWII veterans ceremony.  We also have Rowan Atkinson and Wayne Knight chasing after a heart after it has fallen out of a window.  You have fathers that make their little girls put their bums out the window and go while the car is still moving because of greed.  You have Whoopi Goldberg and her daughter acting like mentally handicapped people after they get off of the fastest car in the world and you have Cuba Gooding Jr. driving a bus full of winy Lucille Ball look alikes.  There is also Seth Green and his brother chasing after a cow and a hot air balloon as it almost takes out a bus.  Now if this is something that sounds appealing to you, then I guess you should rush to see this film.

But as I said, if what is described above sounds funny, then you will probably appreciate the film in some or all regards.Rat Race is about a bunch of people that have to get to a bag that contains two million dollars in it.  A casino owner gets all of best betting customers together to wager on the contestants along the way.  While the race is on, we cut back every once in a while to the bettors to see what silly practices they are betting on next.  In one of the funnier scenes, Dave Thomas tells a call girl that he wants to get naked with her in a pool of Pepto Bismol and have her wear a cowboy hat and lick her feet while she shaves his butt.  She looks at him in a queer manner and then finally replies that she will do it for $3000.00  From behind the curtains all the bettors appear and they begin handing over money to the man that bet closest to $3000.00.  These guys are shameless and will bet on anything.Rat Race is a review that I am actually having trouble finishing.  I know I disliked this film immensely yet when I think about it, I know that it is zany and quite off the wall and that scores points in my books.  Maybe I was in a bad mood that day, maybe I just didn't get the humour or maybe it is really as bad as I say it is.  Whatever.  See it for yourself and be the judge.6.5 out of 10 "},{"Title":"Rat Race proves, it's a mad, mad, mad, mad, world!","Date":"5 August 2002","Score":"1 out of 5 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Adventure, Comedy","Review":" RAT RACE (2001)(4/5 STARS)StarringROWAN ATKINSON JOHN CLEESE WHOOPI GOLDBERG CUBA GOODING, JR SETH GREEN JON LOVITZ BRECKIN MEYER AMY SMART WAYNE KNIGHTDirected by JERRY ZUCKER Written by ANY BRECKMANFrom the very beginning of RAT RACE I knew it was going to be hilarious. The all-star comedic cast alone draws you to the movie, much less the jokes themselves. But let me tell you, the jokes did not fall flat at all. I don't know how many times I laughed, but it was countless. Unlike most comedies, RAT RACE delivers the whole way through, then has a HUGE comedy scene during an already funny movie (a few in particular among many, such as the airport scene, the helicopter scene, The Lucy Bus and the Hitler scene.)Basically a remake of the 1969 film IT'S A MAD, MAD, MAD, MAD, WORLD, the plot of the movie is a little different, and goes a little something like this A billionaire tycoon named Donald Sinclair (Cleese) puts gold coins inside 6 slot machines in his hotel, to draw people on a game of his to be the first to get to Mexico City, and find a million dollars stored in a locker at a train station. First one there, wins it all. We find that a football referee (Gooding) who has made the worst call on a play in history, two money seeking brothers (GREEN) looking to sue the hotel, a mother (Goldberg) just reunited with her daughter she gave away years ago, a man taking his family on their first vacation in years (Lovitz), an uptight young man (Breckin Myer) who finally takes a risk gambling one coin into a slot machine, and last but definitely not least a Frenchman named Enrico Polini (Atkinson) all find a coin. After being let in on Sinclair's game, at first they all say they won't go after the money. Then it begins. ALL of them rush away after the money, except Breckin Meyer's character, which leaves to take a flight home. On the way however, he meets a young female helicopter pilot (AMY SMART) who agrees to fly him to Mexico City, unaware of the little gamble. Later she is let in on the secret however, and she agrees to head to Mexico with him anyway.All the characters are completely loveable, especially Atkinson's. There're some famous cameos in this film as well, to name two are Kathy Bates and the band Smash mouth. There're a lot of interesting things about this film. One, is that it's the first to have two African-American actors in one movie together. Two, the character progression and introduction is done so well, it's incredible. It's truly amazing how good a comedy CAN be, and this is a good reference to look at if you're filming comedy. Another thing this comedy has, is the fact that while you're rooting for everyone, you wouldn't REALLY care if your character doesn't get the million. That's just the way the movie goes. And the end, unlike most comedies is truly great, and while a bit predictable what action the characters will take, we never guess HOW they do.If it's Donald Sinclair betting on who's going to throw up first, to your favorite characters doing wild and zany things, RAT RACE proves, it's truly a MAD,  MAD,  MAD, MAD WORLD , full of laughter and other great things, too many of which to wrap up in this comment! 4/5 STARS "},{"Title":"Passable but really dumb and only for those who like their comedy basic","Date":"11 October 2002","Score":"2 out of 7 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Adventure, Comedy","Review":"  A Las Vegas casino owner has found that he must create more interesting things for people to bet on.  He plants several gift tokens in the machines in his casino.  The winners of the tokens are then told that a locker in a small town in New Mexico contains $2million and that whoever gets there first can have it.  By fair means and foul, the race begins.When my friend rented this I was filled with dread at the idea, but gave it a chance.  Needless to say it is all very dumb.  The plot is a very basic way of getting some action and really it's hard to care who wins or loses the race &#150; which is just as well considering how daffy the ending is.The humour is perfect is you like people knocking into each other and falling down.  I don't but I still laughed occasionally.  Some of the jokes are clever and surprising (the Barbie museum is funny) but most are laboured &#150; for example when something happens and it is made clear, it means it is part of a set-up for a joke.  It makes it feel very staged and dull, taking much of the spark off the jokes (if they had any!).  It is amusing but no more than that &#150; for some parts the sheer energy of the action carries it but overall it is just too dumb and lazy to be really funny.It's hard to believe there's a couple of Oscar winners in here &#150; all the cast get by with absurd mugging and shouting.  Gooding Jr proves yet again that his Oscar was an one-off by delivering a performance of such cartoon quality that you wonder why he bothered.  Goldberg is as bad &#150; but do we expect any better from her now?  Lovitz is amusing but has no really good material to work with.  Green and Vieluf just scream and run around &#150; some of their stuff is funny but really they're jut poor clowns.  Talented British comics Cleese and Atkinson are wasted &#150; Cleese is really poor and has little to do and Atkinson is ruined by a terrible accent, like a 3rd rate Mr Bean.Overall bits of this are funny but really you should only watch this if you love comedies that don't get anymore advanced than people falling over and knocking each other down in a range of forced ways.  I laughed a handful of times but I hated myself for it.

What ensues is nonstop wackiness as the characters try to beat each other to the cash. A gag-a-minute, this flick is packed with unbridled and unabashed silliness in a sort of contemporary Vaudeville-meets-Hollywood road trip format. Well worth a look for those with a taste for unsophisticated, wacky comedy. "}]
