To add insult to injury, she took the dog as well.  Andy, not used to being on his own, meets Lorna (Natasha Henstridge) in a bar and a few sparks fly. Yet, Lorna, who has recently lost her boyfriend as well, is not interested in starting anything new and rejects Andy's advances.  Jeri (Janeane Garofalo), as Andy's close co-worker, arranges for him to participate in a bachelor auction.  Unfortunately, Kieran, loose and crazy, bids for him and promptly moves in with him.  Complicated? You bet!  Oh, and everyone walks their dogs in the dog park and takes their canine friends to obedience school with the same dog psychologist.  Will the doggies get their diplomas even as their mixed-up owners try to straighten out their lives?This is, by no means, a successful romantic comedy.  Instead, it falls into the category of an interesting also-ran.  The main characters are appealing (Janeane Garofolo looks wonderful) but the plot's haphazard storyline is always throwing in more loose ends without connecting them in a logical fashion.  The humor is not laugh-out-loud but rather mild and quirky.  Fans of romantic comedies will probably stick this one out and enjoy it.  Luke Wilson's ever-growing fan club will want to see it, also.  All others will be less enchanted and find it a off-beat diversion with no memorable qualities. "},{"Title":"Unusual and charming.

Dog Park is a very smart film with a real, albeit subtle, depth, which is missed by most -- as evidenced in the majority of the user comments. Close examination brings to mind another film, Medem's Los Amantes del Circulo Polar, and the provocative ideas it evoked about the circle of life, the role that coincidences play in that life, about fate, and pain, loneliness and the desire, ultimately, to find, and be loved by, that one special person.A chance meeting in a bar by two lonely people on the rebound, establishes what will constitute the film's love story. Their meeting is awkward, and uncomfortable, and at least one of them is sure that they've seen the other before, somewhere, maybe ...at the dog park. They take some personal jabs at each other before the two settle into an introductory conversation and quickly realize that there is something surprisingly beautiful about that person sitting across from them. They segue to an apartment only to wind up in a bathroom where one of them is getting sick, while the other gracefully consoles them. Shot from high above the bathroom window, we watch as the two embrace each other, taking note that this is the last time they will grace the screen together for the good majority of the film.The guy is Andy, played by Luke Wilson, an endearing serial monogamist who has been stranded in one romantic relationship after another since the eighth grade, engaged in a sort-of quest for that one special person to share his life with. He slowly discerns that his most recent 'bad date' might actually be that special person he has been seeking all his life, confiding to a friend about her, Have you seen somebody in a certain light and you felt like you knew everything about them? His corresponding love interest is Lorna, played by Natasha Henstridge, an equally endearing person who is so emotionally dented by one too many ugly break-ups that she can't even conceive of getting into another one. She wants true love, and realizes early on that she might actually find it with Andy, but is just unable to gamble being hurt again, best articulated in their post-date phone conversation where she shoots down his offer of a follow-up date. Her facial expression says everything, pointing out the divergence between what she really wants and what she is able to do. She is clearly caught in a personal struggle between her protective instincts and her desire to be loved --  and stranded in her own loneliness.Along for the ride are several other characters, both human and canine, including Kathleen Robertson, Andy's ex, who has dumped him for a sex-obsessed loser, Gordon Currie, who just happened to be the fellow who dumped Lorna. There's also Janeane Garofalo and Bruce McCullough, the seemingly perfect couple representing, at least for Andy, the ideal relationship he desperately longs for -- that is, until it begins unraveling in front of him. There's also several interesting background characters, namely Lorna's bestfriend, Rachel (Carey), Andy's blustery girlfriend, Kieran (Lehman), and Lorna's Mr. Wrong, Callum, played Harland Williams, a contradictory sort, whose wild-eyed goofball antics are only offset by his extraordinary insightfulness. With the film's progression, it becomes apparent that these characters are inexplicably linked together by chance, romance and an unwavering devotion to their dogs.Speaking of dogs, everybody in the film has one, or at least shares one, and all of them are seeking counsel from the local animal psychologist, Dr. Cavan, played by Mark McKinney, who plays the straight man to all the craziness going on around him. In a way he represents the audience, understanding partially the cyclical nature of what is happening; the dogs are showing signs of stress because they are reacting to their owners' stress. McKinney's straight-laced, pseudo-analytical antics and inability to relate to other human beings, including his own children, provide some of the more hilarious moments.Cinematically, Dog Park walks the line between dark and quirky and completely hilarious. It also seems to be pushing some kind of bizarre cosmic diagram. McCullough seemed to have designed the plot around this weird 'life-is-cyclical' idea, mentioned before and evidenced numerous times throughout the film. Actually, I lost count how many times situations or elements are twice repeated in the film, each with a differing outcome. A pick-up story, 'exchanging phone numbers after an automobile accident' is utilized twice in the film, each time with a much different tone. Locations, lines of dialogue, dating habits and minor characters appear or are stated twice with their relevance becoming much clearer on the second go around. Even a number, specifically one-hundred, appears twice in the film, the first time it is used as a means to bring together a couple, the second, to keep apart. There's even a 'dating chain' which is elaborated upon by one of the characters, a sort-of celestial ecosystem that mathematically determines who does or doesn't find love.Bruce McCullough is a very talented director who had a lot to say with this, his first film, and in my opinion, he hit every note perfectly. He understands the romantic comedy in ways that most directors don't, or ever will, conceding that audiences don't need to see the heroes engage in an endless kiss or stagger into a bedroom hell bent on a physical consummation. He understands that sometimes, really, all that is needed is that subtle adoring look across a park or a nervous smile exchanged in a crowded bar by two people who know they are meant for each other. Sometimes that all it takes.I love this film! "}{"Title":"The Truth About Dogs and... People. Hmmm, Might Have Been Nice. But... no.","Date":"14 May 2012","Score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Romance","Review":" by Dane YoussefONCE-TIME Kid-In-The-Hall Bruce McCulloch has one good-as-gold nugget of an idea here. 'Cause speaking from personal first-hand experience, the dog park is one special, magical place. The true place for any dog, dog owner and dog lover.The dogs are given some amount of room to roam and socialize, good or bad. And so are their owners.And you know.... movies are filmed all the time in Canada, American movies even! For the sake of wide roaming space and less cost. There are Canadian movies... made in Canada. But so very, very few.... But... this does.Garofolo's pretty much just phones in the stock-type Garofolo role, knowledgeable about relationships and life with the usual sardonic wit. Except her usual genuine humor here is gone, thanks to her un-character and lines due to the script courtesy of McCulloch. She might have been better cast in the Lorna role. But no, Janeane has too much of a pulse.Bruce actually gives himself a substantial supporting role as the his of a pathologically married His and Hers couple with Garofolo. She still seems almost human, almost possible. She seems to persevere through this incompetence.He's always been a bad actor, but in skits, it's easier to forgive. And with this unfinished first draft of a script and monotone direction, all the actors more or less sink. These actors can act. But his movie manages to convince you they can't. So Bruce's horrible thespian attempts fit right in.Every ounce of blame goes to the man who half-conceived this big ball of half-considered, unfunny awkwardness-- McCulloch. The characters, duller than dullest. Nearly every single line of dialogue and scene feels awkward and mishandled.Not one person in this whole damn thing... comes off as believable. Or really all that insightful.All throughout, McCulloch seems to lack the ability to write a decent romantic scene, a full-fledged written character or a line of dialouge that hears well. When it comes to writing personally, he should well- stick to skits. Or maybe just checks--if any of them are any good. Better than this.Dog Park has no mood. Every scene is badly staged. It was so bad, I damn near expected this thing to have a laugh track.While many of these types exist out there in the world (the sad-sack jilted lover, the cynical sage advisors, the seemingly perfect couple, the superficial couple, the weird oddball, the nypho and the love-scorn pessimist), the movie takes these stock-types and injects no humanity into them whatsoever. No one feels authentic, or even interesting.Other Canadian folk like Harland Williams nothing special and especially awful. He plays the Neo-weirdo Lorna goes out with after she reaches that point when a woman gets so lonely and dying from cabin-fever, she rushes to go out with the first guy she sees. But after the date... he calls her back with a message she desperately, desperately needs.But yes, Bruce and co. I agree wholly that Andy 'n' Lorna are made for each one another. These two, so boring--without any personality or interest--that you'd have to go the morgue to find people who are less alive. These two were made for each other. Two big empty non-existent zeroes.Over the years, McCulloch has developed one tin cauliflower ear for dialogue. As been said by pretty much every other on the planet who saw this, the only performance, character and scene of fellow Kids In The Hall brethren Mark McKinney as Dr. Cavan, an insightful and bizarre dog psychiatrist. There's just not much about the movie overall. Just no real effort. No special insights about dating, relationships, nature--human or canine. No interesting people, philosophies about relationships or anything resembling a good movie-going experience.Now if you'll excuse me, as I write this, it's 730 on the dot. The dogs are at the door, with Christmas morning anticipation. Tails wagging, eyes fixated on the door. It's time for our evening constitutional, the high point of our day. As dog owners know, the local dog park is a treat. They're like late-night singles night clubs up in the city after hours. Anything goes, and often does...--A Long-Time, Long-Term, Life-Long Dog-Lover, Dane Youssef "},{"Title":"Date flick","Date":"7 July 2008","Score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Romance","Review":" Luke Wilson stars as a woebegone fellow who goes from one mating situation to another in DOG PARK.

With the possible exception of McKinney's lugubrious dog psychiatrist, there's nothing in the film that's even faintly funny, and it's certainly not insightful - the attempts to tap a vein of contemporary romantic wistfulness are particularly lame. It's very hard to know what McCulloch had in mind with such a shapeless exercise. The dog park isn't exploited to its full potential, relegated to the site of a few lazy one-liners and a hopelessly messy finale. The odd promisingly deadpan scene (like Robertson's and boyfriend's discussion over whether to have sex or eat first) certainly don't generate any heat in practice. The most uniformly bland movie I've watched in ages (which, as the doting owner of a labrador retriever puppy and a regular visitor to the dog park, I was suckered into by the advertising).

We thought that was odd, particularly based on the 'name' talent involved.Finally, I found it for sale for $0.99 at a Blockbuster 'pre-viewed movies' clearance sale.  AND.... even that scant amount of money was too much to pay.  At least now I have a tape I can use to tape over.I wish we'd seen it in the theater -- it would have been quite a bit of fun to stand up and lustily BOO, BOO, BOO.  Groaningly awful - and *NOT* in the fun 'so bad, it's good' way which you might expect.  I do like Bruce McCulloch, I really do.  And we really wanted to like this movie.  But this movie had nothing of his quirky sensibility.The script is unbelievably awful and devoid of any humor.  Mark McKinney's dog psychologist character would be funny in a 2 minute KITH sketch, but does not cut it as the only 'comic relief' in a 91 minute movie.Human beings simply do not communicate in this way.  Not even Canadians! The generalizations about 'the way dating works' are the kinds of things 14 year olds might say to each other, not these 30 year old (+/- 5 years) characters.The camera work and editing do nothing to help this weak script.  There is one potentially good scene, as another reviewer pointed out, where a girl and guy discuss whether to eat first or to **** first.  With good direction and editing, this conversation has at least some potential for lasting humor.  However, we see the scene in a single cut from about 20 feet away, where we can't even see the characters' faces.Consistency problems show clear lack of thought and care.  Most glaringly, and at the risk of nit-picking, Luke Wilson's dull character makes a point of the fact that after their first date he doesn't know Natasha H's character's name.  Then he has flowers delivered to her at work and follows up with a phone call where he asks for her by name.  Okay, I figured, I guess now he knows her name, we must have missed that scene where he found out her name.  Then, an hour later in the film -- he still doesn't know her name.  Huh???If you want to see it 'just for the dogs,' don't bother.  The dogs get about 10 minutes of screen time, and none of them are particularly cute.A WASTE OF TIME, unless your life's goal is to see every movie Janeane Garofolo has ever been in.  Her character in this one, however, is completely unmemorable and you can't be faulted for missing it.

Kids In The Hall fans will recognize the stolen bike episode, the perfect couple, the screwed-up answering machine message, as well as the dialogue's occasional forays into oddball symbolism.  It's not Bruce's best film work (Mr. Mann the Wig Store Owner or He's got my pen! still takes the prize), but it's a nice film to watch piecemeal on cable.Honestly, if Bruce tries again he should lead with his eccentricity rather than try to couch it in conventional storytelling.  The more left-of-center the film gets, the more successful it is.Mark McKinney is a standout; Luke Wilson is always engaging; Janeane Garofalo is underused.I'd probably feel a lot worse about it had I paid ten bucks to see it in a theater.

I went into the theater with lots of hope for McCulloch, and I came out still hoping that perhaps I was wrong about the movie.  Truthfully, it is flat and cliche -- not even Janeane Garofalo gives an inspired performance.  Henstridge is terrible -- the children on Barney act with more honesty and integrity.  Perhaps it should've been a short film -- or maybe not a romantic comedy. Cinematography and music are good, but I was not impressed by the movie as a whole.  I hate to say it, but perhaps Bruce McCulloch should stick to what he's good at -- innovative COMEDY.  This is one viewer who hopes that the same fate of most SNL alums won't befall our Kids in the Hall heroes.

Well, watching this film made me really yearn for some gross out humor--a few pratfalls, maybe a joke about bodily fluids.   The problem with Dog Park is that it plays it too safe.  I like my comedy with balls...where they lay it on the line and dare you to laugh.  This just isn't the case.This is the usual boy loses girl, boy gets girl formula except set in the refreshingly original setting of a dog park.  The few highlights of the film really come with the casting, which would have just plain torture without it.   The yummy Natasha Henstridge shows us why hordes of guys shelled out seven bucks to see Species.  And, the always superb Luke Wilson does his low-key leading man to a terrific turn.  Other than, I would have to say this is a rental.  It's something you might want to watch while doing your laundry and not paying too much attention to the dialogue or story for that matter.

Originally not hoping for much from the directorial debut of a former Kid in the Hall, I was pleasantly surprised by this romantic comedy which, although quite formula, managed to overcome its genre restrictions with lively performances and a generally oddball atmosphere. Henstridge lights up the screen, and Wilson injects personality into what would be considered a very clich√© role. Despite the typical nineties sardonic-view-of-society undertones of the screenplay, the actual dog park elements are played out very well with a vibrant cast of characters, especially that of the hilarious McKinney. Overall, Dog Park is a nice, cute change of pace from the tired romantic comedy format. Check it out. "}{"Title":"Poor","Date":"14 March 2008","Score":"1 out of 3 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Romance","Review":" Dog Park (1998) * 1/2 (out of 4) Andy (Luke Wilson) is a down on his luck, self described loser who has just lost his girlfriend to another man but to make matters worse she has taken the dog with her. Andy doesn't understand why she would take the dog since she hated it so much but thankfully he's got a friend (Janeane Garofalo) to explain life and its problems to him. The friend tries to explain to Andy that he hasn't been single since the eighth grade so he has no idea what life is like to be single and that he will continue to have bad relationships until he realizes how to get along without others.To get the sorrow out of his heart Andy decides to go to a singles bar for some onion soup when he bumps into Lorna (Natasha Henstridge), someone also suffering from a bad relationship. The two do some small talk and decide to have a one-night stand but after puking in his lap, the two go off in separate directions dating other people. In this time Andy starts dating a wild woman who wants nothing more than rough sex but he keeps thinking back to Lorna knowing that she's the right woman for him. He keeps going to the dog park where he hopes to meet her again while at the same time hoping to get his beloved dog back.Dog Park is another film in a long line of movies that tries to get a message across about love but anyone who has had at least one date in their life will come away rolling their eyes in disbelief because the film is so incredibly bad that you can't help but be thankful this turkey only spent a few weeks in theaters after sitting on a shelf for over a year. I'm a die-hard Woody Allen fan but I'm beginning to think he put a curse on the world because he's the reason so many bad films have been made because other's try to recreate what he does but usually falls flat on their faces.The films message is the typical one that if you keep trying you'll eventually find love yet the characters are so poor one doesn't have to wonder too hard why they can't keep a relationship going. As with other films of its type, Dog Park features a loser guy, a loser woman and their wonderful friends who give wonderful advice yet the losers never seem to listen to them. The first eighty-minutes of the movie features tears, heartache and dating but in the end we've seen this countless times before and we know how things will work out. As I've said before I'm often curious if these type of films use the exact same story outline and only slightly change character's professions and the color of their hair.Luke Wilson gives a rather bland and completely forgettable performance, which isn't a good thing for your lead actor. There isn't a single moment in the film where he gives off any energy, which just makes the film all the more unbearable to get through. He delivers each of his lines so slowly that you can't help but think he's reading them off a cue card. Natasha Henstridge gives another bland performance but for some reason she feels her smile will carry us the way. Put the two stars together and we get no chemistry whatsoever, which again, doesn't help matters. Janeane Garofalo, usually very reliable, doesn't add anything either because she isn't given anything to do. Harland Williams is the only bright spot in the cast but he's only here for a few minutes.This was written and directed by Bruce McCulloch from Kids in the Hall fame and he shows nothing original in either department. Various scenes go on and on without any direction and I personally couldn't see a point in any of them. There an incredibly stupid scene with a dog psychologist, which seems to be taking itself way too seriously even though what's being talked about is so silly that one must wonder how any producer could have taken it to heart. The screenplay offers nothing new and nothing original so if you want to see a loser try to make a rebound then check out a Woody Allen film or just buy a dog to talk to. Either one would be more entertaining than this film, which certainly needs to be scooped up and thrown away.

This is one of the worst films of all time.  It's billed as a romantic comedy, which is weird, as it is neither romantic or funny.As a Canadian, I am ashamed of this film.  I saw it opening night, and there were 10 people in the audience.  About halfway through two different couples left the theatre.  The only reason my friend and I didn't leave was that all the other movies had started (so there was nothing else to sneek into).I would tell you about the plot, but who cares.  There's no character development.  Which doesn't matter, as the audience doesn't care about any of the characters anyways.If you love the Kids In The Hall (like I do), stay far away from this film.  Or else you will have nothing but disdain for Bruce McCulloch for the rest of your life.  He even cast himself in the film - BAD CHOICE.  He gives one of the worst performances in a movie (that's supposed to be credible) since Elizabeth Berkley in Showgirls.DO NOT GO SEE THIS FILM.  Trust me, it's THAT bad.  Go see Kids in the Hall Brain Candy instead. "}]
