[{"Title":"One of the must-see holiday classics","Date":"13 December 2002","Score":"51 out of 54 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Drama, Family","Review":"  While the 1951 Alistair Sim version of A Christmas Carol is the most faithful to the original Dickens story, A Muppet Christmas Carol possesses heart, whimsey, and a joy that is so very much lacking in our evermore commercialized holiday season.  Michael Caine's performance as Scrooge easily surpasses those of Reginald Owen (1938), George C. Scott (1984) and Patrick Stewart (2001).  There is a more genuine degree of transformation and redemption in his characterization than has often been portrayed. This makes the story a truly wonderful experience both for adults as well as for children.The use of the Muppets in the various roles makes for a lively film experience.  Statler and Waldorf as Jacob & Robert Marley are appropriately heckling as they seek to convince Scrooge to change his ways.  Kermit the Frog is a wonderfully sympathetic Bob Crachit just as Miss Piggy is appropriately and aggressively belligerent Mrs. Crachit.  Perhaps one of the better-inspired comedy bits comes with the arrival of Scrooge and the Ghost of Christmas Past at Scrooge's former workplace, described as Fozziwig's Rubber Chicken Factory.  Such bits are frequent and help to keep the story fun.  Paul Williams' music score and songs are eminently singable and leave the viewer with a lasting memory.A Muppet Christmas Carol has joined the pantheon of classic holiday films, easily ranking alongside Holiday Inn, White Christmas and A Christmas Story. It is the opinion of this reviewer that for those whom holiday films have become a part of holiday celebration should make this a part of their seasonal experience.  One might even complete the film humming the tunes and thinking better of themselves as well as of their fellow humans.  In other words, Henson and company have made Dickens story as memorable as Dickens himself wished it to be.

Right from the glorious opening shot, as Brian Henson's camera glides over a convincing Dickensian townscape before coming to rest in a snowy town square teeming with surreal and hilarious activity (fans of the show will get a big kick out of the speaking vegetables and the brief cameo by lunatic boomerang fish salesman Lew Zealand), you know you're in for something very special. Gonzo, the self-styled connoisseur of pain, and his wisecracking little pal Rizzo the rat take centre stage as the storytellers, setting the scene just before Michael Caine as Scrooge (in one of his very finest performances) strides around the corner and an already unfeasibly busy film bursts into stunning, detailed and endlessly rewatchable life. The set design in this film is just amazing - check out the amount of action taking place at the windows, in the gutters, in the doorways and almost everywhere else - and the animation of the puppet characters never ceases to be charmingly convincing. The production design is also remarkably good - there's an early example during the first song, when the appearance of Caine causes a sudden shift in the lighting and atmosphere from the warm glow of Gonzo's prologue to an almost eerie pale blue light. Although Rizzo actually remarks on this, the change is so subtle you probably won't notice it until your second or third viewing, but you certainly will appreciate it, subconsciously or not. Rather than getting bogged down in special effects and technical wizardry for its own sake, the scenes that utilize visual trickery are smoothly incorporated into the flow of the story rather than being imposed upon the film as self-conscious set pieces - take, for example, the Spirit of Christmas Past's flight over London (our attention is with Gonzo's death-defying method of hitching a ride), or the ever-changing size of the Spirit of Christmas Present (clue - look in the background during the brief glimpse of the party being held in the mousehole), or the location segues during the Spirit of Christmas Past's visitation. This approach benefits the film immensely, as it never distracts or misleads the viewer - a lesson the Disney company still refuses to take on board, as even their finest efforts are invariably laden with showstoppers that stick in the mind long after the rest of the film has faded into distant memory. But the most remarkable aspect of this beautifully subversive take on the beloved Dickens classic is that the core story, with all its attendant pathos, humour and timeless theme of welcome redemption, is neither diluted or stripped of its resonating power. Whilst the Disney animated version, in which Donald Duck played the unscrupulous miser, fell on its face with its ceaseless romanticism and stylization, this Muppetational version retains not just a Dickensian mood but, with the narration of Gonzo and much of the human players' dialogue, a truly Dickensian flavour as well.Besides, what's not to love about this film? It's virtually flawless. Kermit, as Bob Cratchit, remains one of the most loveable and endearing characters in the Muppet repetory company. Everything about this self-effacing little green frog is funny - the way he walks (slightly stooped), his half-dazed eyes, his voice, his ultra-expressive face...and if you don't double up laughing at his acapella sing-song with his nephew Robin (here cast, inevitably, as Tiny Tim) as they come skipping over the hill on Christmas day, then you should hire a stonemason to carve the word CYNIC onto your heart. And yes, Robin gets to sing again, Jerry Nelson making his voice sound uncannily like a child's with the charming Bless Us All, a logical companion piece to Halfway Down The Stairs. Waldorf and Statler, perhaps the show's ultimate cult figures, are finally rewarded with a scene-stealing turn as the ghostly Marley brothers, backed up by a chorus line of singing cash boxes (it's the Muppets, remember!); Fozzie bear is suitably overwhelmed as Fozziwig, the rubber chicken manufacturer (and his use of an ear trumpet in the closing scenes provide the hapless would-be comedian with his biggest laugh for decades); Bunsen and Beaker get some decent scenes as a pair of charity collectors (is it just me, or does Beaker flip the bird at Scrooge at the end of their first scene together?!); Miss Piggy makes a fine wife for Cratchit, and Animalgets a well-deserved close-up, although Dr Teeth and the Electric Mayhem are hardly suited to playing slow waltzes! Paul Williams's songs, on first hearing, are servicable rather than memorable, but after a couple of viewings they'll be as hard to get out of your head as Rainbow Connection, and ultimately emerge as one of the reasons this film stands up to repeated viewings so well.THE MUPPET CHRISTMAS CAROL is a delightful family film, possibly too good for kids, but definitely worth dusting off at any time of the year, especially when you're feeling blue. Jim Henson would have been proud of this one.

Just about everything!  Michael Caine made a great Scrooge, and this film showed us, possibly better than just about any other version I've seen, just how Scrooge came to be such a miser (although that could partly be because the versions I saw which really go into Scrooge's childhood were clearly adult versions, which meant they could be more subtle in their explanations).  To Caine's eternal credit, he made Scrooge very believable, which is no small feat considering most of his fellow cast members were puppets.And what about the Muppets?  They were also brilliant!  Kermit made an excellent Bob Cratchit, loyal and humble, and he had a wonderful tribute to Tiny Tim which also served as a brilliant tribute to Jim Henson.  Miss Piggy was a great Mrs. Cratchit, feisty yet very loving toward Bob (the worst of her temper was thankfully muted by the story).  Fozzie the Bear was a hilarious Fozziwig, and The Great Gonzo and Rizzo the Rat made a great team, having some of the best lines out there (my favorite is Rizzo's Light the lamp, not the rat!  Light the lamp, not the rat!).  The ghosts were definitely believable (and in the case of the two Marley Brothers, hilarious as well).  Incidentally, the original text had only one Marley -- Jacob, but to get the two comedians from the balcony in the story, Robert Marley was added.Finally, the songs were rather good, with the best one (in my humble opinion) being When Love is Gone.So, I firmly recommend The Muppet Christmas Carol to one and all.Belle Book  "},{"Title":"My Favorite Version Of This Famous Story","Date":"17 April 2006","Score":"28 out of 34 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Drama, Family","Review":" In terms of humor or songs, I can't honestly rank this was high as most of the other Muppet films BUT it may be the most touching version of the Dickens classic story I've ever seen on film.The lyrics to the last two songs are fantastic very Christian-like and very profound. Scrooge (Michael Caine), meanwhile, is not portrayed as some screaming maniac as he so often is in other versions. His transformation from cold-hearted tightwad to caring, generous person is done more subtly, too, than in other films. However, to be fair, sometimes the slapstick humor in here gets in the way of the touching story.The last part of the movie is a lot sentimental drama than Muppet comedy and I found that refreshing.

The humor is truly funny and appropriately placed (notice how a very good reason is created for Gonzo and Rizzo to exit during the serious Christmas Yet to Come portion .)

This is a well done version of the story, and it is the only Muppet movie I can look at as a real movie, rather than a movie starring Muppets.The way the story is told in this movie is done really well. Having Gonzo play Charles Dickens as he narrates the story was a smart move. It adds more humour to the story. The different characters that Muppets pop up as are genius, for instance, changing Fuzzywig to Fozziewig so Fozzie Bear could play him. Also, the movie manages to remain dark like the story should be, while also staying tame for kids.Micahel Caine is great as Ebenezer Scrooge. He's actually one of the best Scrooge's I've seen. It really speaks for his acting talent when he is able to talk and react to Muppets like they're people.Overall, this is a classic children's film, and is probably one of the best versions of the classic tale on screen.8/10 "},{"Title":"The very best of all the Muppet Movies!","Date":"24 November 2005","Score":"3 out of 3 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Drama, Family","Review":" The Muppet Christmas Carol is my favourite of all the Muppet flicks. Jim Henson, of course, never lent his name to anything even remotely resembling 'bad', but nevertheless, there is a clear mark of sheer mastery and brilliance in this movie that is somehow less evident in most of the other muppet movies.In a way, I have to admit that I find this surprising. This was the first Muppet movie to be shot after Henson himself passed away; the voice of kermit, the most beloved and indeed inventive puppeteer ever to have lived was dead. Could Henson's magic touch ever be recreated? Did the Muppets have a future at all without their creator? The answer, of course we now know, is Yes they did.As is the secret to all truly great children's movies, The Muppet Christmas Carol does not pander to notions of anything being 'too scary'; nor does it shy away from the innate darkness of the material at hand. Dicken's tale is one that revolves almost uniformly around themes of corruption, poverty and death, and here it has most certainly not been diluted.There was the year we evicted the entire orphanage! I remember the little tykes all standing in the snowbank, with their little frostbitten teddy bears! hollers a ghostly apparition of Scrooge's dead business partner early in the film. We witness a heartbreaking lament from Scrooge's lover, who leaves him because he has become too money-hungry to love her. We watch as Bob Cratchett's family mourn the empty chair at their table where their beloved and selfless young son once sat. At the eleventh hour, scrooge even bends before his own tombstone and begs in tears of desperation to a grim reaper-like spirit to be allowed to live. So much for it being the season to be jolly.Where there is humour, it is frequently black, and where there is emotion, it is generally somewhat adult by todays standards. Of course, before you decide not to show this to your five year old son or daughter, you should consider that these dark themes by no means drag the film down; rather, they help to raise it up to become, just like the original story, a stirring and emotional story of triumph and redemption in the face of mortality. Whilst the script writers wisely keep the story pretty much identical to the original in all of it's major aspects, there is plenty mayhem and indeed magic here too which is 24 carat Henson Studios. I remember as a 5 year old simply adoring the spectacle of Kermit's Bob Cratchett taking part in a the Penguins of London Annual Christmas Skating party, or the delight of Gonzo and Rizzo's almost post-modernist presence as physical participants but also omnipotent narrators in the tale. Indeed, the translation from book to screen is almost peculiarly elegant; the Muppet characters all seem to open up to new ranges of poignancy and dramatic possibility when placed in the storyline. You will find yourself feeling immense pity for Miss Piggy's somewhat hysterical but ultimately warm Mrs Cratchett for example, and indeed a whole host of wonderful performances on show from the familiar Muppet Show Cast. Of course this review could not be complete without tribute to the simply brilliant performance from the great Michael Cane in the role of Ebeneezer Scrooge. he understands his role excellently and invests it with a moving, convincing and genius reality; always resisting the temptation, that must surely be strongly felt when one is the sole human among a cast of felt puppets, to play the role for laughs. One feels that his performance would not seem out of place if he were surrounded by the ranks of great British thespians and taking part in a 'straight' production of Dicken's tale as opposed to a Muppet movie. Upon recently viewing the Patrick Stewart film of this story, I was delighted to find that Cane quite simply out-acted Stewart in the role and clearly this makes his performance something special.The production values are high in this film as is to be expected in a Henson movie, and the film has a wonderful, almost Tim Burton-esquire look which is by turns wintry and quite breath-takingly beautiful or dark and positively scary. In terms of music it is filled with an array of wonderfully enduring and subtly written songs that fill me with a sense of child-like happiness and that allusive 'christmassey feeling' even after all these years. One recommendation I would make to anyone planning on purchasing the film is to if at all possible obtain a copy which contains the beautiful song When Love Is Gone which, in the recent DVD re-release, was sadly cut from the film. This decision to exclude the song from the film detracts hugely from the pathos of one of the film's central themes (past Mistakes and ultimate redemption) and definitely takes away some of the indescribably bitter-sweet overall mood of the film.I strongly recommend this film to people of any age or gender as a film that it is virtually impossible not to fall in love with.

All the things which have made the Muppets appealing--charm, humor, tenderness--are very much in evidence in this adaption of Charles Dickens' much-retold classic.Michael Caine fills the central role of Ebeneezer Scrooge admirably, throwing himself into the part with much energy and gusto.  Familiar Muppet faces take up several roles--Kermit and Miss Piggy as Bob and Mrs. Cratchit, Robin as Tiny Tim, elderly hecklers Statler and Waldorf as the Marley brothers (Dickens' character Jacob and original creation Robert)--with new Muppets designed for the roles of the three Christmas ghosts.  The result is a somewhat fanciful 19th-century London where humans, animals, talking vegetables, and various undefinable creatures live side-by-side.  In spite of potential complications the concept works very well, thanks to the spirited performances by both actors and Muppet handlers.Gonzo (adopting the persona of Dickens himself) and Rizzo the Rat narrate the story and add a healthy dose of humor to the proceedings.  But the film knows when to be serious--the climactic scene focusing on Christmas Yet to Come is as eerie and touching as it should be.  And ultimately, the resolution leaves one with the warm, peaceful joy synonomous with the season.  Definitely a movie which deserves a place among the family classics of the holidays.

It reminds me of Francis Ford Coppola's Garden of Stone, which he made right after his son died. It's never exactly acknowledged, but the making of the film itself is part of the grieving process. Jim Henson hadn't made a movie with the muppets since Muppets Take Manhattan before he died, and one wonders if this adaptation, made immediately after he and, also sadly, Richard Hunt passed on, was a way for the Henson company to get on with things as the grand master would've wanted. While Christmas Carol in and of itself is a dark story, it's an ambitious turn for the (relatively) young Brian Henson to tackle such a production like this, with a major star like Michael Caine. But it works, very well, even if it's not the kind of Muppet movie you'll pop on over and over. It's better actually as a real movie, not as a satire, with touching songs and a respect for the original material. Kids will love this, unless they are afraid of the melodrama or aren't keen on Dickens story to care (it's understandable, some just want to Muppet antics from the 80s movies).

The Muppet Christmas Carol is basically a retelling of Charles Dickens A Christmas Carol that features Ebenezer Scrooge who hates Christmas, and always says humbug. So, now Scrooge has to face three spirits that shows him about his past, present, and future. What I mean by retelling is that it takes place in the 1800s, and it features your favorite Muppets like Kermit the Frog; Miss Piggy; Gonzo; etc. Michael Caine is really good as Scrooge, and I thought his singing voice was fine at the film's finale. The movie does provide some good laughs, but they are not laugh out loud hilarious. The sets are well done as well as Brian Henson's direction. The songs in the movie are fun, but don't have much to say about. The movie is really not my favorite Muppet movie or my favorite Christmas movie, but it is still fun to watch. If you are a fan of the Muppets, then you will love this movie. Overall, The Muppet Christmas Carol is a fun retelling of Charles Dickens' book and you will have a fun time watching this movie that really does have that Christmas joy, and seeing one of your favorite Muppets in this movie.

And it is my loss that is the case, as today I stumbled on a movie I wish I'd watched with my two kids when they were much younger than they are today. Plot In A Paragraph In this adaptation of the Christmas story narrated by Charles Dickens himself (played by Gonzo the Great) , It is Christmas Eve in 19th century London. The merriment is not shared by Ebenezer Scrooge (Michael Caine), a money-lender who is more interested in profit than celebration. He is so against it, that his staff, including loyal employee Bob Cratchit (Kermit the Frog), have to beg for Christmas Day off. Later that evening, Scrooge finds himself face to face with the still mean-spirited ghosts of his former business partners, Jacob and Robert Marley (Statler and Waldorf) who have been condemned to shackles in the afterlife as punishment for the horrible deeds they committed in life. They warn him that he will share the same fate, only worse, if he does not change his ways, and foretell the arrival of three spirits throughout the night. The Ghost of Christmas Past, the Ghost of Christmas Present and the Ghost of Christmas Yet to Come.

What more can you ask for from a Christmas film? It was a fitting tribute to the peerless Jim Henson, whose son Brian did a fantastic job directing the film.Michael Caine is excellent as Scrooge and he takes the role as seriously as if it was a more conventional adaptation of the Dickens classic. When it comes to family / children's films and TV series, some actors see it as an excuse to go over the top but Caine is too experienced and talented to make that mistake. It's a shame that my three favourite Muppets - Fozzie, Miss Piggy and Kermit - all had much less screen time than usual but they were all very well used. The Christmas Present and Christmas Yet to Come scenes in the Cratchit home were definitely my favourites. The latter could hardly have been more heartfelt if it had involved humans instead of pigs and frogs. Paul Williams wrote some fantastic songs for the film.

I am glad I own the original full screen DVD release, as it leaves this song in. (1851 format to begin with, so there is very little cropping.) This is a gentler retelling, unlike the scary and almost violent 2009 Scrooge. My 4-year-old could even handle the Ghost of Future segment! The worst fit seems to be Kermit and Piggy and family as The Cratchits. However, Miss Piggy is a scream as she tastes the entire Christmas dinner and snorts down the chestnuts. Robin (as Tiny Tim) is a sickly shade of green and coughs a lot. Michael Caine is masterful as the very-human Scrooge. Gonzo and Rizzo as the narrator and his sidekick are a stroke of genius. Nice scaled-down London set. This movie is very kid-friendly The Ghost of Christmas Present dissolves into a bright set of holiday lights. Christmas Past is a beautiful floating fairy. You never see the Future Ghost's face. Most of The Muppets you know and love play various parts or act as extras.

You can virtually guarantee the likes of Wallace and Gromit, The Sound Of Music (which is on right now as I write) and multiple versions of Charles Dickens' iconic Christmas fable on some channel somewhere. Thank Heavens for the Muppets who offer us their interpretation of the story which not only provides the necessary slapstick for younger viewers but also enough witty lines and songs for older viewers, all wrapped around the classic 'festive redemption' nugget.In a snowy Victorian London, where humans and Muppets seemingly live side-by-side, our narrative pair of Gonzo (as Dickens himself) and Rizzo the Rat introduce us to Ebenezer Scrooge (Michael Caine). The legendary miser has no time for Christmas, despite the pleas from his long-suffering employee Bob Cratchit (played by Kermit the Frog). But after being visited by the two ghosts of his long-dead partners (played by Waldorf and Statler), Scrooge is told that he will be visited by three more ghosts who promise to show Scrooge the error of his ways.Once the unusual sight of Caine towering over his felt co-stars has passed, The Muppet Christmas Carol is a fine retelling of what has quickly become a perennial Christmas favourite. The moral core of the story remains unchanged but given that the Muppets' have a style all of their own, the story sometimes takes a back seat to a song and dance routine or a comic set-piece. By and large, these work but a couple of the songs felt a little weaker than the others. The real stars are the puppeteers behind the scenes, filling the screen with shots you never thought would be possible with puppets. Each shot is filled with noise, action and colour - even the Swedish Chef was in there somewhere! But the movie also does a grand job of producing a suitably spooky atmosphere when the ghosts begin to plague Scrooge, although obviously nothing too frightening. Caine wisely decides to let the Muppets have their way throughout the film, playing the movie straight down the middle and eschewing the need to play it for laughs.What it lacks in closeness to the source material, The Muppet Christmas Carol more than makes up for in cross-generational appeal. Its humour and warmth provide a comforting contrast to the nasty weather outside this time of year, although I suspect that may be due to the story itself. It's also a reminder of how entertaining the Muppets were and still are, occupying a unique space in movie history. There are certainly worse adaptations of Dickens' work out there but frankly, haven't you seen this before by now?

This is an adaptation of Charles Dickens' novella first, a Muppet film second. Take Michael Caine's fantastic performance as evidence of this - at no point does his Scrooge acknowledge that he's talking to a puppet. Every creature that he comes across, be they felt or flesh, are simply characters within the story. Or, how about the fact that Miss Piggy, one of the most famous of all Muppets, doesn't appear until about half-way through the film - or that she and Fozzie only appear in two or three scenes?It's a risky but, ultimately, completely successful choice as The Muppet Christmas Carol is a wonderful film from start to finish, perfectly encapsulating the tone of the novella. The Muppet comedy is left to Gonzo (as Charles Dickens) and Rizzo, but even they sit out the Christmas Yet to Come sequences in respect to the tone. The songs are also very good, with Mr Scrooge, One More Sleep Till Christmas and It Feels Like Christmas being the particular highlights. It would be remiss of me to not mention When Love is Gone, the films's love-song which was cruelly cut from the cinematic release, restored for the VHS, occasionally found its way to DVD and is cut again for the Blu-ray. Yes, it's slow and may make kids restless. No, it doesn't feature any muppets. But if any film sells the torment that Scrooge feels when he thinks of his lost love Belle, it's this one. I can think of very few sanctioned cuts that damage a film so severely.In adaptation terms, the film is also surprisingly faithful and I can think of only two missteps. The first is the absence of Christmas Past scenes showing Scrooge's unhappy relationship with his father and his sister Fan's attempts to fix this. The second is, during the Christmas Present scenes where we see nothing of Nephew Fred saying anything particularly sentimental about Ebeneezer and instead simply skip to Fred making fun of him.But these are minor nitpicks- and cannot dent a film that has so much heart. If it's not making you laugh, it's making you cry. And when I watch this film every Christmas Eve (be that the ones in the past, the present or those yet to come), it prepares me perfectly for the festive season. If you want a truly faithful adaptation, I recommend the 1984 TV film starring George C.Scott. If you want one of the best family movies of all time, go for this.8/10 for the cut version, 9/10 for the version with When Love Is Gone.

This usually leads to financial failure and an absence from the media. It could've been that way for The Muppets after Jim Henson passed away in 1990, but by that time, The Muppets were immortal as it was. Thankfully Henson's son, Brian Henson decided to take hold of the reigns and lead the way.And as of Mr. Henson's first theatrically released Muppet film, I must say, it is superb add-on to the franchise. The story of The Muppet Christmas Carol is exactly parallel to that of Charles Dickens' novel. The are no changes in the story, order wise, but there are a few little tidbits that will have the audience understand that this is a Muppet production and not just them retelling the story. For example, The Great Gonzo plays Charles Dickens in this film, the omniscient narrator of our story. And no he doesn't talk from out of the sky; he actively takes part in the story. And along side him is his pal Rizzo, who also provides us with some comedy relief.And that's just these two characters. You still have the rest of the Muppet crew. Because Jim Henson was no longer around, Steve Whitmire took over the role of Kermit the Frog, but unless you really have good ears, it's not easy to hear the difference, which is great. This is why these Muppet characters are immortal. As long as they have a voice actor who has a voice that closely matches their predecessor, no one will ever know. Playing Scrooge is English actor himself, Michael Caine. Caine gives an excellent performance as the grumpy old humbug moneylender. Caine is effective when he's tough and angry and when he's soft and emotional on screen.As for the rest of Muppets go, the usual voice actors perform their parts for their respective Muppets and they do a great job at it. Every Muppet you think that'll have a part will be in this film, no doubt. And it's great because you get to see every single one have a little screen time of their own. The special effects are good for their time; nothing looks overly edited or out of place. The score by Miles Goodman is a fun listening experience as well. In all aspects, it evokes the right tones and emotions all at the right moments. Some real good work here.This first theatrically released film starring The Muppets without Brian Henson's father on board is still just as great. Jim Henson may have left, but his spirit is still there.

Playing Scrooge is the great Michael Cain who not only gives one his best performances here but is also one of the best Scrooges of all time. He can be both gruff and mean but when it comes to those emotional scenes, well, if your not crying or on the verge of crying, then your not human. In particular, the scene with Scrooge in the graveyard is probably the most powerful one in any of the Christmas Carol versions and believe me I've seen quite a few Christmas Carols. However, its not all gloom for there is plenty of comedy and good songs that one can find in any of the Muppet movies while at the same time, for the most part, the makers do a good job of keeping true to Charles Dicken's work. Kermit the Frog plays Bob Cratchit, Miss Piggy as his irritable wife, Statler and Waldorf as Jacob and Robert Marley (nothing but praise for those two in that dual role) and Gonzo and Rizzo the Rat as the film's narrators. Plus, you can find all your other favorite Muppet characters spread through out the movie. In short, this is a movie that both kids and adults can enjoy and anyone who says different, well, they have to be a Scrooge themselves.

Every element of this screams class. Even from the opening shot as the camera pans over a model of Victorian London crafted to a level of detail I'd expect from some modelling fetishist you know that you are in very safe hands. With Gonzo taking on the role of Charles Dickens and Rizzo the rat taking on the role of Rizzo the Rat, the pair act as our guides through want is one of the most charming Christmas movies I know.Trying to talk about this film is like trying to decide which packet from a box of Options to have first. It's all so good! OK&#x85; The music. I'll start with the music. From the opening number (Scrooge) we're treated to hearty, well written tunes that you can join in with by the second chorus. It's genuinely difficult to highlight a stand out number as they are all utterly charming. From Statler and Waldorf as Jacob and Robert Marley, to Scrooge regaling us with 'Thankful Heart' via the Ghost of Christmas Present singing 'It Feels Like Christmas' every song is fantastic. Disclaimer That's not actually true. In the original cinematic release and the VHS version there is a song sung by young Scrooge and Belle called 'When Love is Gone'. While it still exists on the closing credits &#x96; in a inferior version sung by Martina McBride &#x96; it has been cut from the widescreen DVD release. OK, the song wasn't great, but I don't agree with the cut, mostly because now the scene is rather jarring, with Belle rather softly accusing Scrooge of no longer loving her and then suddenly departing, leaving Rizzo in tears. It feels like the hack job it is.Golly I hate finding flaws in this film, so lets move onto the acting. Pleasingly it's mostly the Muppets here, but with them is Michael Caine as the man himself Scrooge. Now it might be easy to forget that, back in 1992, Sir Michaels career hadn't exactly been shining for the past decade. In fact he had been in some tosh and hadn't really done himself any favours with his performances. However this movie was, far and away, his best in ten years. He is stupendous! Something else great that this movie does is make Tiny Tim likable. I don't know about you but in most versions of a Christmas Carol I just want to punch the kid. They are normally either not that tiny, or to young to give a convincing performance and, no matter what, I almost always feel sorry for the other Cratchet children as they are forgotten in favour of their saintly brother. But because in this version Tim is a Muppet well&#x85; it's OK! It actually works! Though I do get frustrated when I see the Cratchets living in a nicer house than I have&#x85; This movie is a crafted piece of Christmas merriment. With so much going on in each shot you do not get board with repeated viewing, a 'must' for an annual favourite, it stays fairly true to the book, which again is good as, in my opinion, if you're going to start messing around with a work of genius you want to be *really* sure you can improve on it. And finally, like a favourite Christmas jumper, this film will warm and comfort you and is guaranteed to put you in that Yule spirit. Watch it.

I had borrowed some compilation CD's of festive music as well as some DVD's of various Christmas films that could just be run on the TV in the background on mute. Making an assumption I put this film on mute only to be told that my partner had never seen it and, not having seen it myself for several years, we stopped it as background and decided to watch it at the end of a day of cheer, relaxing, feeding ducks in the park, presents, food and, of course, wine. So it was we came to watch the Muppet Christmas Carol, perhaps with low demands but still unwilling to put up with anything that wasn't good or that dragged the mood down.I needn't have worried because, although it is not a perfect film, Muppet Christmas Carol is a real joy that delivers on several levels. Most surprisingly the focus is on the telling of the story &#150; this has its own modifications but it is surprisingly faithful to the story we all know and it is only really the use of the narrator that changes how it flows. This doesn't matter though because the film is surprisingly engaging &#150; it doesn't just TELL the events, it draws us into the characters &#150; or rather character. I make this distinction because that the film does this is almost entirely down to a performance from Michael Caine that is brilliant apart from one or two minor missteps that are more down to the material than him. It is not just that he plays it deadly straight the whole time despite being surrounded by puppets and people below him working them, it is that he plays it so very well &#150; this is a performance that is way beyond the standard expected for such a film. He holds so much emotion in his eyes and face that minor changes tell of a softening or hardening of his heart. It is in this area that the film engages and it is almost a shame that it is a seasonal kids film because his performance deserves more praise than it gets.In support of him, the film shores up with other aspects that you expect it to deliver in. In terms of laughs there are plenty but no massive killer or sequences that are built around a joke &#150; it is key that he humour never gets in the way of the plot or compromises Caine's part of the film. I say part because, although the narration device has its detractors, I did like it as an easy way of framing the story but more for the fact that it allowed for little comic moments that exist as part of the film without putting jokes into the actual Christmas Carol story so much as in the packaging thereof. The songs are rarely magical but are serviceable at worst and good at best &#150; Caine's singing is not great but his performance bought him a pass on that as far as I was concerned and credit to him for doing it himself. The various Muppet characters are all well received as on paper it is their film, even if reality it is very much Caine's.It seems weird to be praising a children's Christmas film because as a genre they are rarely the place to go for entertainment as they can be obvious, sentimental and not really much good outside of the season. However, thanks to the core work of Caine, this is a good film in its own right and the well-delivered humour and songs around this core only help and don't detract.

After all, how else can we approach the first large-scale Muppet project since the death of Jim Henson (and Richard Hunt), especially when it came so close on the heels of drastically increased commercialization of the franchise, symbolized, if not outright created, by the Muppets' sale to Disney? That's why the film turns out to be such a pleasant, and even occasionally delightful, surprise. It's not perfect, by any means, and I guess I might as well start with the problems first. There's a *lot* of padding, including some rather cruddy songs for the Cratchits. Frank Oz, in his few scenes, seems to be phoning it in, and his Piggy voice has become so strained that's it's painful to listen to. And Steve Whitmire, while he performs an honorable, even admirable impression, can never approach Jim Henson's interpretation of Kermit for anyone who knew it first.And yet, there's a kind of magic that creeps in and reminds us many times of the early Muppet Show days and their wonderful insanity. Throwaway gags like Please sir &#150; I want some cheese and the running commentary of Gonzo and Rizzo give the film that unmistakably Muppety flavor.And not only is the movie good Muppets, it's good *Dickens*, which is perhaps more surprising. In fact, in some ways it's hard to imagine a better musical adaptation of A Christmas Carol &#150; it's certainly better than either of the other two musical Scrooges that first come to mind. To choose a random point of overlap, where Albert Finney and Kelsey (ugh) Grammar make their entrances hobbling along and singing their crabby wee hearts out, Michael Caine stalks silently in while the *chorus* comments on him. Like Bill Sikes in Carol Reed's Oliver!, this pre-transformation Scrooge doesn't have the time or the patience for *singing*, as of course he shouldn't. Paul Williams's songs themselves vary in quality (and Caine, while in most respects an above-average Scrooge, is no singer), but the opening chorus and Scrooge's buoyant revelation number are terrifically tuneful, and wonderfully orchestrated with a brassy, classically Christmas-y texture. Having chains physically *drag* Marley (or rather the Marleys) back into the netherworld would be a marvelous idea in a straight adaptation, and having the elderly Scrooge join in a sad duet with his decades-lost love is genuinely moving. The Muppet effects for the ghosts, while simple, are extremely effective, and very true to Henson's vision of elegant, beautiful, and frequently spooky puppet artistry.In the end, it may not be a perfect film, but it's more than worth a look both for Muppet fans and casual viewers.

A movie for children, you say?  Absolutely.  Adults?  Most certainly.  All that's required of any audience is that you suspend disbelief for awhile and check your doubts at the door; do that and you're in for a thoroughly enjoyable ninety minutes or so as Caine, Kermit, Miss Piggy and all the rest bring you a unique and entertaining version of the Charles Dickens' classic, guaranteed to be unlike any you've seen before.  For the younger set, the antics of the  muppets alone will be enthralling; for the rest of us there's some subtle humor (as can be found in all of the muppets outings), and of course the story itself which, when well crafted and delivered-- as this one is-- always seems fresh, especially when seeing a new version for the first time.   	Henson has done a tremendous job of melding the live actors with the animated and presenting them together in such a natural setting, and with such imagination, that it's easy to accept the world in which they live and thrive; so much so that if Gonzo came to your door while you were watching this one, you wouldn't think twice about it.  And there are so many clever bits sprinkled throughout, for instance, having the Marley `Brothers,' Jacob and `Robert.'  Things adults will pick up on, and which will be entertaining to kids who will take what they see and hear at face value. 	As for the casting of Michael Caine as Scrooge, to land such a gifted actor to anchor the story was a coup indeed; and Caine more than delivers, creating an imposing figure of Scrooge that he makes quite his own.  And how gratifying to see yet another interpretation of one of the most well known figures in literature played so well.  Caine immerses himself in the part and performs opposite Kermit the Frog or Miss Piggy with the same dedication and eye for detail that he did opposite Olivier in `Sleuth,' or Connery in `The Man Who Would Be King.'  It's a performance that lends distinction to the film and illustrates what a consummate professional Caine is. 	Everyone's favorite muppets are on hand for this one, with Kermit in the role of Bob Cratchit, Miss Piggy as Mrs. Cratchit and The Great Gonzo in the role of Charles Dickens, who also narrates the story, along with the help of Rizzo the Rat.  The familiar tale remains intact under Henson's direction, and what a treat `The Muppet Christmas Carol' will be to the youngsters who are being introduced to it with this film.  And for the holiday season it's like a bright and sparkling decoration that will fit in nicely with the traditional festivities of every family, and will help to keep the spirit alive within all of us.  I rate this one 9/10.

The Muppet Christmas Carol is a satisfying experience for old-school fans; it seems less zany and adventurous than the earlier films, but still includes quite a bit of the old Muppet chaos.  It seems to me a cautious re-entry into the movies--kind of a resassurance to fans that things will get better.  Argue with me if you like, but I think there are moments of this film that are very touching.

Usually we get a new version of the Christmas Carol, Charles Dickens's most famous and popular novel about the redemption of a man who doesn't believe in Christmas. Some of the most worthy Christmas Carols are the George C. Scott version (Which I badly want to see), Scrooged with Bill Murray (Which is technically a spoof but still worthy of mention), and The Christmas Carol with Patrick Stewart (Which was very true to the novel in almost every way) while other versions basically stink like The Christmas Carol Musical with Kelsey Grammar and the way too short and slightly stupid Disney Christmas Carol (Though I do have to admit the scene where the Ghost of Christmas Future shoves Scrooge into his grave and a fiery coffin opens up was chilling beyond belief.). The best, without a doubt, is the Muppet Christmas Carol. It's not scary (Most of the time), has an AWESOME Scrooge (Michael Caine is perfect!) and the story doesn't revolve around the muppets. Plus the songs are cool.Narrated by Dickens himself...who bears a remarkable resemblance to the Great Gonzo, and aided by Rizzo the Rat, The Christmas Carol is set in Dickensian London at, what else, Christmas time! We then meet Ebenezer Scrooge, a vicious money-lender who hates Christmas with a passion and love money with a lust. On Christmas Eve night he is warned by his deceased business partners, Jacob and Robert Marley, that he will die if he doesn't change his ways. Three spirits, one at a time, visit him and show him the Christmas Past, Present, and Future. Scrooge learns so much about how he came to hate Christmas that finally repents on his grave. Envigorated with the Christmas Spirit, Scrooge sets out to make it a wonderful and Merry Christmas for everyone!

I would almost say he is too good for the part. Really strong performance that carries the film from start to finish. The Muppets I am usually not the biggest fan of and here they worked well sometimes and sometimes not so much. But as this one is especially for younger audiences, they are absolutely needed for the comic relief away from the dramatic, sometimes creepy story. I also enjoyed the music in here. In terms of emotional impact, this was only partly a success. Probably the loud and boastful Miss Piggy will take heart and feeling out of almost everything. And a little Kermit as Tiny Tim (one of the emotional highlights of the tale usually) is not working particularly well either. I enjoyed this one the most when it's humans only that we see, although I also liked for example the part when one of the gang climbs over an incredibly high fence with all his effort and shows us right afterward that he can easily get in right through the fence.

The decision to take in Michael Caine's disciplined, down to earth doctrine in his approach to acting and toss it in with the lovably loopy, varied psychedelic muskrats we know as the muppets is a stroke off juxtaposed genius that make for quite the charming outing. Caine makes a slight Scrooge, relieving us by never being totally committed to the initial nastiness that hallmarks the character, and being especially upbeat when it comes time for the old codger to make his legendary mood swing and dive into the spirit of Christmas. I've only seen Caine in a single film where he played an outright son of a bitch, and it's downright jarring. He's such a pleasant fellow, and makes the perfect companion to the critters that populate the show.

A good movie.","Date":"28 December 2013","Score":"","Genre":"Comedy, Drama, Family","Review":" The Muppet Christmas Carol is a classic Disney movie that lives up to a lot of the other adaptations of Charles Dickens 'Christmas Carol'. It's better than some others Christmas Carols movies. This movie was the first film released after the deaths of Muppets creator Jim Henson and fellow puppeteer Richard Hunt. While the film didn't have any Sesame Street or much Fraggle Rock characters. It's probably the best Muppet movies ever because it focus on a main human character first, rather than the Muppets first right. Rather than playing themselves in the film, the film mixed their Muppet characteristic to that of the characters of the book, with negative and positive result. I just couldn't get behind, Gonzo the Great (voice by Dave Goelz) as Charles Dickens, the author and narrator for this film. Yet, I can see Kermit the Frog (voice by Steve Whitmire) as Bob Cratchit. I can see Fozzie Bear as Fozziwig. I have to say, for all the modern day adaptations, Michael Caine as Ebenezer Scrooge was amazing. He can give a great cold shoulder performance, while also having a bit of a charm to his character that makes you like him ever more. I'm glad, they didn't use a Muppet for this main character. Ebenezer is a surly money-lender who is more interested in profit than celebration Christmas. He treats his family, employees, and friends really horrible. Later that evening, Scrooge finds himself face to face with ghosts. Glad, again, they didn't use Miss Piggy, Scooter, & Gonzo as the ghost as well. Note the description of William Shakespeare's Hamlet passage in the beginning that foreshadows the entrance of the ghosts. I love the simplistic symbolism in this film with all the ghosts represent limits. The ghost visits all contain a distinct episode in Scrooge's spiritual re-education. The ghost of Jacob and Robert Marley AKA Statler and Waldorf Waldorf (voice by Dave Goelz & Jerry Nelson) is limited by his greedy sins, as his chains are forged of cashboxes, padlocks, ledgers, and steel purse. Dickens was particularly disgusted with the writings of an economist named Thomas Robert Malthus, a wealthy man, who wrote Essay on the Principle of Population (1798) that population growth would always outpace food supply resulting in unavoidable and catastrophic poverty and starvation. Dickens alludes to Malthus as Marley, when Scrooge echoes the economist's views on overpopulation in his rebuke of the portly gentlemen. The Ghost of Christmas Past might scare some little children, but I just can't help liking the visuals effects of this film. Ghost of Christmas Past (voiced by Jessica Fox), a childlike specter who takes Scrooge on a journey back through time to his youth is just beautiful to watch. Christmas past is limited by the darkness or negative thinking. The symbol of his light bright head cover by a cap represented optimistic thinking or the illuminating power of the mind. By covering his head with the cap, he limited himself. That is why some people believe that the Ghost of Christmas past is in fact, a young Scrooge whom allow negative thinking to seep in. The Ghost of Christmas Past also represents memory, and all the memories are that of Scrooge. So it does makes sense. I have to say, the film was missing the mention of Fan, Scrooge's sister that plays a big role in his childhood. I love the story of how Scrooge fell in love with Belle (Meredith Braun). Eventually, Scrooge and Belle break up due to Scrooge's obsession with money. While, the two don't share screen time too long; it's work as an emotional heartbreaking scene. Sadly the song 'When the Love is gone that works with this great scene was cut in some versions of this movie. It's a great song, and not having this song, makes it look like they jump an awful cut. I have to say, don't watch the versions that doesn't have this song as you'll be missing a big part of the back story. The Ghost of Christmas Present (voice by Jerry Nelson and Don Austen as In-Suit Performer) was outstanding as the large, festive spirit with a booming voice who lives only for the here and now. He gives Scrooge a glimpse into the holiday celebration of others. The Christmas present ghost is limited by lifespan. He can only live on single day. He represent the central symbol of the Christmas ideal--generosity, goodwill, and celebration. It might be note that he was the late 19th century blueprints to what he think of now as Santa. The Ghost of Christmas Yet to Come was just scary, a silent entity who reveals the chilling grim future for Scrooge. He is pretty much the Grim Reaper. With A Christmas Carol, Dickens hopes to show how self-serving, insensitive people can be converted into charitable, caring, and socially conscious members of society through the intercession of moralizing quasi-religious lessons. By doing this, Dickens had to make a one-dimensional, representation of the plight of the poor with Tiny Tim (Robin the Frog). Dickens had every intention of tugging on your heartstrings with this tragic figure. Underlying the narrative and paralleling the more ostensible theme of moral redemption, lies an incisive political diatribe. Dickens takes aim at the Poor Laws then governing the underclass of Victorian England. He exposes the flaws of the unfair system of government that essentially restricts the underclass to life in prison or in a workhouse. The story also mirrors a lot of Dicken's younger life when his father was jailed. It was during this terrible period in Dickens' childhood that he observed the lives of the men, women, and children in the most impoverished areas of London and witnessed the social injustices they suffered that give him the idea. Overall it's a good movie with good music, love nearly all the songs. The visuals are great. Acting was good. It's worth watching during Christmas.

The familiar Muppet characters take on various roles Kermit plays Bob Cratchit, with Miss Piggy as his surprisingly pliant wife; Stadtler and Waldorf play Scrooge's erstwhile partners, now living as the Ghosts of Christmas past; Fozzie Bear plays Fozziewig (Fezziwig in the Dickens text); Sam the Eagle has a fine time playing the Head Teacher of the Junior High School graduates. There are some nice in-jokes, such as the occasion when Sam the Eagle associates money-making with the Americans, but abruptly changes his line of dialogue when reminded he is acting in a British classic; now it's the Brits who are guilty. One of the shops seen in the final sequence where Scrooge bestows gifts to all is called Micklewhite's - a direct reference to Caine's real name. Miles Goodman's songs are catchy yet not exactly memorable; Caine at one point is forced to sing, which provides a few embarrassing moments.

The first song is the most memorable. While the rest were initially forgettable, they were pleasant enough with a touch of festive spirit. The whimsical if somewhat generic incidental music had its Christmassy charms as well and the voice acting for the Muppets stayed in line with that from the original Muppet Show despite Kermit's voice actor having changed. Gonzo was perfect as Dickens to narrate the story while Kermit and Miss Piggy provided top-notch support as Bob and Emily Cratchit respectively.All in all this is one of three of my favourite adaptations of the classic Dickens novel, the other two being 'Mickey's Christmas Carol' and the version starring Jim Carrey that has a similar design to 'The Polar Express' and it's still a joy to watch over Christmas. 9/10.

Two years later, in December 1992, the Muppets released their newest theatrical movie, The Muppet Christmas Carol. This was the first Muppet production that was released after I was born, and I LOVE THIS FILM! This is a wonderful movie! The Muppets keep up their tradition of having so much heart, charm, and spirit in their Christmas special. It's also a fantastic tribute to Jim Henson and his fellow puppeteer Richard Hunt. Richard Hunt performed such characters as Scooter, Janice, Beaker, Statler, Sweetums, and Gladys the Cow and the Two-Headed Monster on Sesame Street....But I digress.This movie accurately tells the story of A Christmas Carol. There are some changes here and there, but they don't sugar code the story that much. It's a very good adaption, and a very good way to introduce the story to kids. Kermit is Bob Cratchit, Piggy is his wife Emily, Fozzie is Fozziwig, Gonzo is our narrator Charles Dickins, Rizzo is himself, Statler and Waldorf (now performed by Jerry Nelson and Dave Golez) are Jacob and Robert Marley, and our Ebenezer Scrooge is portrayed by Michael Caine.To be honest, this is one of the weird things about this movie. In this Muppet movie, Ebenezer Scrooge, the story's main character, is played by real human Michael Caine. In past Muppet movies, there was always a human cast, but the focus was on the Muppets. Here, the Muppets share the spotlight with Michael Caine. It makes sense when you think about it - after all, which Muppet could actually play Ebenezer Scrooge? - but it's still weird thinking that our main star is not a Muppet. Maybe it's just me, but it's just kinda weird.A lot of our favorite, lovable characters aren't shown here a lot like they are in other films, like Rowlf, The Electric Mayhem (they're seen, but Animal's the only one who speaks), The Swedish Chef, Scooter, and Sweetums. The reason is obviously due to the passing of Jim Henson and Richard Hunt. In these days, the producers made the decision to not have the characters speak in honor of our late Muppet performers. I actually thought that was a nice idea.This is one of the first movies ever I have the earliest memory of watching. This film has a special place in my heart because it is THE Christmas movie for me and my family; we do not let the Christmas season pass without watching this movie. But even by emotionally detaching myself away from this movie, it's still a really good film. The songs are great, the comedy is good, and you're even pulled into the drama. If you're curious to see how the Muppets take on the great Christmas classic piece of literature, take a look at this movie. You won't be disappointed! BOOYIKA!

It is my favourite version of Christmas Carol, it is amazing how well this film works when in theory it shouldn't. Given the material and the subject matter a host of mostly muppets shouldn't be able to pull off this film as well as they do. The film stays mostly faithful to the actual story and while maintaining the serious tone of redemption and caring for your fellow man it injects that humour that only the muppet characters can provide. The muppets are well cast in the roles they are given and it really does work.And I haven't even come on to Michael Caine's performance as Scrooge. There have been various portrayals of Scrooge and in my personal (albeit slightly biased) opinion Caine brings out what Scrooge from the book should be. He is cold, calculating and down right mean while at the same time allowing room for the possibility of a redemption that you can believe.I will certainly be watching this film several times over this Christmas period.

The iconic roles of the book are mostly filled by Muppets(Kermit as Bob Cratchit, Ms. Piggy as his wife, etc.)but Scrooge himself is portrayed rather well by Michael Cane. You should be well aware of the story of A Christmas Carol by now, a man is viewed as a miserable, greedy miser and is visited by three ghosts who show him his past, present and future. Little by little he becomes a better man through these visions and ultimately turns his life around for the better. The same applies for this movie. Only there's a lot of humor you'll find in a Muppet movie. Fourth wall jokes, slapstick, the usual brand of Muppet style. But some of the dialog is actually taken from the original book, and the themes of redemption and good will toward men are still present. One thing that makes the movie a good adaption is that the three ghosts were originally created Muppets just for this movie. Being a Muppet movie there are a few songs in it but they're all done very well and don't seem to slow down the plot(at least for me).The Muppets really captured the tone of the original story for me and I really love this version. I recommend it to any fan of the original book , or fans of the Muppets or just about everyone. While I can't guarantee everyone will love it, it's at least worth a watch.

It is, of course the classic Charles Dickens tale told using the inimitable style of the Muppets. My thoughts later, here's a very brief summary first (summary haters please go & buy the biggest goose you can find while I write the next paragraph).This is the story of Ebenezer Scrooge, a mean businessman who treats his staff very badly and is mean to everyone, even his own family. One Christmas Eve he is visited by the ghosts of his old partners, the Marley's. They warn him that he will be visited by three ghosts that night and urge him to change is ways or he will end up like them, in chains for all eternity. The Ghost of Christmas Past visits him first and he is taken back to his childhood to see the boy, and the young man, he was and he began to see what could have been. Next comes the Ghost of Christmas Present and he is taken to see his employee, Bob Cratchit and his family. One of Bob's sons, Tiny Tim is crippled, but has great spirit and this touches Scrooge deeply. Finally the Ghost of Christmas Future visits Scrooge and shows him what future awaits him if he doesn't change his ways. Will he take heed of the ghosts? Well, if you don't know I guess I'd better not spoil it for you.It's a pretty well made film with lots of comic moments thrown in courtesy of Gonzo the Great (as Charles Dickens), the narrator, and his sidekick, Rizzo the Rat. There are plenty of songs along the way too, these didn't do much for me, but I guess they have their place. I thought Michael Caine was excellent as Ebenezer Scrooge, but please don't sing on film again Mr Caine, it's not your best talent I'm afraid.Over all, a very engaging film with lots of familiar characters, some great comedy and a pretty decent Scrooge. It's not the best Christmas film ever made, but it is pretty entertaining and I enjoyed seeing the Muppets again! I liked the fact that they didn't stray too far from Dickens original story too, and so, recommended (but mostly for younger viewers).My score 7.4/10 "},{"Title":"Spend Christmas with the Muppet's","Date":"30 November 2010","Score":"","Genre":"Comedy, Drama, Family","Review":" I remember watching this film with a friend of mine and how it made her smile.

Michael Caine is perfect in his role as Ebeneezer Scrooge. It's hard not to rate his performance in this film as he delivers a fantastic turn opposite what is essentially someone's hand covered in felt and foam. My one grumble, however, has been the removal of one of the songs from the DVDs and TV broadcasts more recently - When Scrooge is in the past and splits up with his partner. The song was very poignant and Caine's voice breaking as he fought back tears in the duet had me biting my fist and trying not to blub like a 5-year-old. It now just goes from her saying she's going to leave, doing so, then Rizzo crying. I luckily managed to pick up a VHS copy with the full film in so plan to burn that to DVD for this Christmas so I can fight the tears once more!!

As I write this, it's been over two months since the holiday last came around, winter is almost over, and the other three seasons will come and go before Christmas comes again. However, I didn't watch The Muppet Christmas Carol because it's a Christmas movie. I watched it because it's the Muppets. I remember seeing at least some of this fourth silver screen Muppet movie, the first one made after the tragic death of creator Jim Henson, as a kid in the early '90s, but couldn't remember much of it at all. It was definitely well over ten years, probably over fifteen years, since I had last seen any of it before finally watching it all this month. Even out of season, it was still a good viewing.There are many celluloid versions of A Christmas Carol, the famous story written by popular 19th century author Charles Dickens, but this one features the Muppets in the story. Gonzo plays Dickens himself and is the one who tells the story here, with Rizzo the Rat as his sidekick. The story is about greedy, selfish, mean-spirited businessman Ebenezer Scrooge in 19th century London, England who has a bad reputation in this city! It's Christmas Eve, and Scrooge does not believe in this holiday season, so one of his employees, Bob Cratchit (in the form of Kermit the Frog), has to tell him that the place won't get any business on Christmas Day in order to get the day off. After Scrooge arrives back home that night, before he goes to bed, he is soon haunted by the ghosts of Jacob and Robert Marley (Statler and Waldorf), his late former business partners who were a lot like him and are now shackled in the afterlife because of it! They tell him that he will suffer the same fate unless he changes his ways, and also tell him of three spirits who will come into Scrooge's bedroom late that night!This 1992 theatrical Muppet film is visually impressive with its cinematography, filming locations/sets, and special effects. Some of this shows right from the beginning, with overhead camera shots of what is supposed to be 19th century London here. Since it's the Muppets, one would likely expect a lot of laughs in this movie, and there certainly are those. A lot of them come from the Gonzo and Rizzo scenes. I think these two characters usually are funny, and there's no exception here, with their usual antics and many things that happen to them during the telling of the story. It was also a great idea to have Statler and Waldorf as the Marley Brothers. Even though Jim Henson wasn't around to take part in this film, and several Muppet voices had to be replaced after his death, the famous puppets still stand out as their lovable, funny selves here. They help carry the film, as usual. While Muppets are used for many of the characters in the story, some of the characters are played by on screen actors, including Scrooge, played by acting veteran Michael Caine. His performance as one of the many actors to portray the character in film history is definitely another highlight of The Muppet Christmas Carol. As well as being funny, the movie also eventually becomes touching, and not all the scenes are for laughs.This Muppet version of A Christmas Carol says at the beginning that it's dedicated to the memory of Henson and Richard Hunt, another puppeteer who worked as a Muppet performer and whose life had also sadly come to a premature end by the time this movie was filmed and released. Henson had been deceased for over 2 ½ years by the time The Muppet Christmas Carol came into theatres during the Christmas season of 1992, but they still managed to make another good film with the characters, and watching it this month made me feel like it honoured Henson, unlike the third theatrical Muppet movie made after his sad passing, the very disappointingly dreary Muppets From Space. Some of the songs in this musical adaptation of Charles Dickens' book might be a LITTLE weak (though they're mostly pretty good, even if they're generally not classic), I didn't really care much for the version of the Spirit of Christmas Past here, and there may be other minor flaws, but all the positive aspects of the film make up for this, and make this holiday film an entertaining one for probably all ages.

A very, very cute adaptation of Dickens' classic tale. I love The Muppets. I love whatever they do. I love Treasue island, the jewel thief one and others. I think my favorite would have to be The Christmas carol though. Michael Caine does very well(of course he does he's Michael Caine) as Scrooge. I will not go into the story plot with you. We have seen at least one out of the billion adaptations. There is a fantastic one in theatres as we speak. You must see that one. Anyways, back to the Muppet's. In a lot of Muppet's movies, they at least have one famous actor. There's in this one is Michael Caine. Caine does such a good job in everything he's in. We should all know that. The Muppet's are incredibly funny. All of the characters are. I think I like Kermit the most. Quit the heckling. I think Kermit is annoying. You have such a good time with this movie. The songs in it, surprisingly, are good. I ain't into musicals, this isn't really one, but they do well here. Caine is convincing, as are the Muppets. This isn't the best of the Christmas carol adaptations. But it is a good one. There have been a hundred adaptations of A Christmas carol. Though The Muppets isn't the best, it is one of them. I give it a high rating because I love The Muppets and because I laugh a lot during this film. I like how,besides Scroge and his nephew and his friends, everyone in the town was a Muppet.

The first trilogy consists of The Muppet Movie, The Great Muppet Caper and Muppets Take Manhattan. The second trilogy consists of The Muppet Christmas Carol, Muppet Treasure Island and Muppets From Space. What separates these trilogies has nothing to do with plots and such, as the movies don't really have much connection with each other, other than the fact that they of course contain the Muppets. What separates them is the fact that the first trilogy was made before the tragic death of the Muppet creator, Jim Henson, and the second was made afterward. Being the first movie made completely without Henson, and I really have to say, they handled it very well. The movie was directed by Jim Henson's son, Brian Henson, and he really filled his father's shoes well. They also had to use a new voice for Kermit the Frog, Jim Henson's most well known role, and also the other Muppets he voices. Taking over the role as Kermit was Steve Whitmire, who I believe did a fantastic job keeping the character alive.As the title suggests, the movie is yet another adaption of Charles Dickens' famous story A Christmas Carol. Various characters are portrayed by Muppets, while several characters are portrayed by actual actors, with the key role of Ebenezer Scrooge being played by the brilliant Michael Caine. He did a great job, and it's my favourite role of his. That's partly what makes this movie interesting&#x85; all Muppet movies before this one were all about the Muppet characters, with human characters in more supporting roles. This movie focuses on a human character, with Muppets in supporting roles (not counting Gonzo as Charles Dickens narrating the movie). Kermit the Frog plays Scrooge's kind hearted assistant, Bob Cratchit, Miss Piggy plays his wife and Robin the Frog plays Tiny Tim.Part of what I love about this movie is how well they are able to keep the fun of the Muppets, yet still tell a heart-warming story of A Christmas Carol. There are scenes in the movie where I honestly get a little emotional&#x85; but I am a big sook with stuff like this! I think that this the effort put in by Caine contributed a great deal to the emotional side of the movie. I think, if played by another actor, the end result may not have been as good. That's not to say it's not a well made movie overall, it's great! I'd have to say, my favourite parts of the movie would have to be some of the songs. They're catchy, and I often find myself singing them. My favourite is probably Marley and Marley, performed by the characters Waldorf and Statler (both with different performers, due to the death of Henson and also Richard Hunt, who died in 1991).If you have children, or if you want to feel like a kid again, you must get this movie, as it is a must see, especially over the Christmas holidays (a time when it was shown each year for a while when I was little). The movie actually makes my Top 50, along with The Muppet Movie and Muppets Take Manhattan (and also Labyrinth, if you want more puppet fun). I've actually caught flack for having them on my list, but it really doesn't matter. I love the movie, and I make absolutely no apologies for it!

One of my hobbies is collecting anything and everything that is Muppet, at least relating to The Muppet Show. Naturally, I've seen all the mainstream Muppet films, and it's difficult for me to determine which one of them is the best. However, if The Muppet Christmas Carol is not the best of the movies, it at least comes in second or third.There are so many things I like about The Muppet Christmas Carol I really don't know where to start. For starters, I found from actually sitting down and reading Charles Dickens' story that this movie stays more true to the original book than other adaptations. Other movies, for instance, make the mistake of naming the last ghost to visit Scrooge The Ghost of Christmas Future, when it's actually The Ghost of Christmas Yet To Come. Other versions completely skip over Scrooge's nephew's has done me good and will do me good speech. Although this Muppet version did take its own artistic liberties with the story, and didn't reenact Dickens' story word for word, they still did a really good job telling the story.Another thing I liked is that the makers of this movie didn't worry about making the film too sad or too scary for kids. I found from watching the movie at the age of 26 that these parts which were sometimes very sad added some real depth to the movie overall. I still can't help but cry during the scene when a young Scrooge finally loses Belle, and she sings The Love Is Gone (a song, by the way, that was originally cut out of the theatrical version back in 1992, but was thankfully re-added in the video release a year later). The scene with Robin as Tiny Tim singing Bless Us All is also very touching.Not only does this movie stand as one of the best Muppet movies made so far, but Michael Caine in this performance alone plays at least one of the Top 5 best Ebenezer Scrooge's in film history. This is significant too, especially since a number of great actors have made a name for themselves for portraying Scrooge long before 1992. I haven't seen every version of A Christmas Carol, and probably never will, but Caine made a very convincing, and human, Scrooge. When he was mean, he was mean! When he was transformed by his dream experiences in the end, he really came off as genuine and believable, which is probably not easy to do when acting alongside puppets.There's so much else that's great about this film. Gonzo and Rizzo the Rat made great narrators, providing comic relief to prevent the movie from being too serious. The special effects were amazing, especially the Ghost of Christmas Past who looked like a living Monet painting. And most of all, Jim Henson would have really been proud of this film. There must of been a lot of pressure for the Jim Henson company to make this film great, especially since it was the first Muppet movie made after Henson's unfortunate death two years earlier. Fortunately, even sixteen years after the film's release, it still stands as a perennial favorite alongside all the other Christmas movies and TV specials played annually on TV. It's a great film, I still love watching it again and again, and I recommend it to anyone.

Academy Award winner Michael Caine stars as Ebenezer Scrooge, a selfish miser who hates Christmas, and he is also a boss to Bob Cratchit (played by Kermit the Frog), who tells him tomorrow is Christmas morning. At one point, when Scrooge gets angry and shouts something funny, the rats (that are working for Scrooge along with Bob) begin to sing the The Island in the Sun song.One night, Scrooge gets haunted by the spirits of his partners, Jacob (played by Statler) and Robert (played by Waldorf) Marley, who both tell Scrooge that he will be haunted by three spirits. When Gonzo shouts EXPECT THE FIRST GHOST WHEN THE BELL TOLLS ONE!, Scrooge is visited by the Ghost of Christmas Past (played by Waldo C. Graphic from The Jim Henson Hour and Muppet*vision 3-D, AND PLEASE NOTE this movie marks Waldo's very first big break into movie business just like all the other Muppets did). Scrooge is later visited by the Ghost of Christmas Present, who sings the song It Feels Like Christmas. When the clock strikes twelve, Scrooge is visited by the Ghost of Christmas Future, or Yet to Come, and even both Gonzo and Rizzo can be unseen when the Ghost of Christmas Yet to Come is around. At Christmas Morning, Scrooge asks Bob to be his partner, Bean Bunny has brought in the turkey, and Tiny Tim (played by Robin the Frog) says, God bless us everyone.The Songs in this Muppet Movie are catchy. Also the gags and scenes are very funny and hilarious to me throughout this movie. For example, Rizzo shouts at Gonzo, Light the lamp, not the rat! Light the lamp, not the rat!

The story, as everyone probably knows by now, centers on one Ebenezer Scrooge, a greedy and mean-spirited moneylender who thinks only of money and can only respond to Christmas with bah, humbug! On Christmas Eve, he receives an unexpected visit from his deceased business partners, who warn him that three spirits will transport him to his past, present, and future. Grudgingly, Scrooge goes along with the spirits, and eventually realizes that his selfish acts will provide not only drastic consequences for himself, but for the welfare of his long-suffering clerk, Bob Cratchit, and his sickly son, Tiny Tim.The film follows the original tale faithfully, and more importantly, keeps most of the dark, sometimes dreary tone of Dickens' tale. Since the story has its share of heartbreaking moments, it is surprising that this movie, skillfully directed by Brian Henson, manages to handle them in a very emotional way without coming across as forced or out of place. Scenes such as Scrooge witnessing the departure of his former love Belle and an even more devastating sequence where the Cratchit family mourns the loss of their beloved, frail son (keep in mind that this is only a vision) all manage to tug at the right heartstrings effectively.Naturally, the Muppets do sneak in ways to provide a bit of humor in various places, but in an adaptation like this, it is most welcome. Actually, most of the laughs come from the Great Gonzo as Charles Dickens, who narrates the story to a skeptical Rizzo Rat as the latter questions about whether the scary stuff is appropriate for children. That's all right, this is culture, explains Gonzo, er, Dickens, respectively.It is a treat to see Kermit the Frog and Miss Piggy as the Cratchits and even more amusing to see those old tycoons Statler and Waldorf as the ghosts of Scrooge's deceased business partners, but the whole weight of the movie rests on the performance of Michael Caine as Mr. Bah Humbug himself. He plays the role flawlessly, somehow managing to blend in with his Muppet and human co-stars. Also noteworthy are the creation of the spirits themselves Christmas Past is a ghostly-like child, Present is a jolly, Santa Claus like giant, while Future is a dark-robed, faceless figure who is made all the more scary by the fact that he is mute. Paul Williams' musical numbers are also very sprightly and infectiously catchy, well-suited to both the spirit of Christmas and the story itself.All in all, THE MUPPET Christmas CAROL is great family entertainment, but even adults may find a lot to enjoy too.

This version of A Christmas Carol is fun and accessible to almost every age, if perhaps slightly dark in parts for the very youngest of viewers - This should, however, be expected by anyone who even remotely knows the story.As a note to the person that thought that the movie had only two or three songs, the movie had seven song performances, not including overture, instrumentals or the songs played during the credits.A Muppet Christmas Carol is the perfect Christmastime movie.

Also, yet again I am commenting on one of the many versions of A Christmas Carol. This is actually a pretty good version. Also, if you did not know, this is a Muppet version of it. Actually, this film does not really have a lot of Muppets in it. I mean, there are Muppets around the edges of this film, but Scrooge is not a Muppet, and only Jacob Marley is a Muppet. I have no idea what the Ghost of Christmas Past was, though.It is basically the plot of the Charles Dickens novel. Grumpy man is visited by ghosts that show him what a horrible man he is. He is horrified that he is a ghastly human being so on Christmas he changes into a very caring man giving everyone presents. Oh, by the way, Gonzo and Rizzle the Rat are narrating the movie and travel with Ebenezer Scrooge.Overall, this is a nice little cute version of a Christmas Carol. Also, I would like to point out that the Ghost of Christmas Past is unbelievably creepy, even more creepier than the Ghost of Christmas Yet To Come. Also, Scrooge's appearance in this film is a good scene, with good music and good atmosphere. I thought this was supposed to be a musical, but there are only two or three songs in this movie. Either way, this is a good film.7/10Recommended Films Scrooge.

If you're a fan of Dickens' writing, you'll like the way that much of the dialogue is lifted from his original novel and yet can still be understood by the audience, whatever their age. (Of course, Rizzo's literary observations don't hurt, either.) If you're into costumes you'll appreciate that the present cast are dressed in the typical 1840s Dickensian wardrobe, whereas in the Ghost of Christmas Past segment, the boy Scrooge wears Georgian clothing and the young man (who looks uncannily like a younger Michael Caine) dresses in Regency attire. And pretty much everybody can appreciate those wonderful Muppets.Although the tale of Ebeneezer Scrooge is well known as a simple Christmas parable, it's clear just how much work went into making this film really work - using Fozzie Bear as Fozziwig, for instance. I wonder if that's why the Hensons decided to make this particular story in the Muppet style. In the school scenes, the walls are covered in busts of Aristotle, Shakespeare and others, all made to look like Muppets. The fake snow looks better and adds more Christmas atmosphere than real snow ever could, and I like the darkness of Scrooge's office - if he was too mean to provide lighting, it would have looked like that.I do like the interaction between Gonzo and Rizzo - Should we be worried about the kids in the audience?, No, this is culture - and the way they retreat from the scary Ghost of Christmas Future by hiding in the church. It surprises me - given the way that the Ghost of Christmas Present was designed - that nobody ever seems to have made a toy out of him.The inimitable Miss Piggy is a wonderful (and, dare I say it, borderline psycho) Mrs. Cratchit - it seems so right that she's enormous compared to Kermit, with all her curly blonde hair and her mob cap.One thing I was really sad to hear of is that some new DVD versions (I was watching my thirteen year old video) have cut the song When Love Is Gone. It may seem soppy to some, but I think it's an important bit of the story because it shows that Scrooge lost people he loved because he was so concerned with money.

It may not be a cinematic masterpiece along the lines of Capra's It's A Wonderful Life, but it certainly has earned a place on any must-see holiday list. From the opening montage where we see beloved Muppets and new ones, the next eighty-six minutes fly by. The script is fairly accurate - some dialog is directly taken from the novella. The songs are well-written and fit perfectly into the movie. I find myself humming them at work, they're so catchy. Perhaps my favorite thing about the film though, is that it's thoroughly a family film. Parents who remember The Muppet Show from their own childhoods can share the fun with their children. It also introduces every generation to classic literature - even if it is narrated by the Great Gonzo.

Another thing I like is that the viewer is taught things about Charles Dickens in a funny way, by the Gonzo and Rat characters. All the creatures are so cute, and they say the cutest things. One of my favorite quotes is,Mother taught me never to eat singing food. The 'asides' are funny and make the viewer want to continue, because it's not so serious that they give up watching. The world of Charles Dickens had so much poverty and injustice, that seeing this version with the muppets, softens the pathos, and makes it a little easier to watch.

On Christmas Eve Ebeneezer sees his dead business partners, Bob and Jacob Marley(Waldorf and Statler) and then is visited by three ghosts. It's a great family comedy, and a great movie too. Muppet fans may have a problem that Fozzie Bear only has a small role as Fozziwigs, but it's a good role. Brian Henson directs this movie wonderfully, and even though all the muppets don't have actual roles, he gives them nice cameos. Dr.Teeth and the electric Mayhem show up as Fozziwigs band, with Animal on the triangle. Lew Zealand shows up as a fish salesman. Even Jim's favorite puppet Rowlf shows up for a small, but nice cameo where he joyfully plays the piano. I recommend it, but it is boring. It's too slow for small kids and for adults.

My wife and I, this evening, were looking up the 1966 film ALFIE with Michael Caine. I had never seen the film. But while looking it over, and being really amazed at the sheer number of films that the man has done, I clicked on one of my favorites THE MUPPET Christmas CAROL.It was then that my jaw dropped. The overall rating is 6.9 -- something I consider close to 3.1 points shy of where this film belongs. There are not many 10s in my book of films. The Godfather, perhaps. Ben Hurr, might be there. And perhaps Patton. But in this list, most definitely, is this little gem.First of all, I am an old fan of the Muppets. From the old days of watching everyone from Steve Martin to Alice Cooper host THE MUPPET SHOW (nothing like the Muppet version of Welcome to my Nightmare I can assure you). The death of Mr. Henson was something that struck me fairly deeply, like a part of my childhood being ripped away.Brian Henson's word since has been spotty. Some of it has been good, some of it sub-par, but all of it worth seeing and enjoyable. But without a doubt, the peak performance has been with this beautiful rendition of a timeless classic. And lest I not get this across as I write this, let me say it now there has never been (nor can I imagine in the future there will ever be) a better portrayal of the Charles Dickens's classic.The songs are perfect. The two best sung by Scrooge, one as a young man losing his first love, one as a grateful old man on Christmas morning telling us that if you wish to measure the worth of a man, you simply count his friends. But the rest are nothing short of spectacular the ghost of Christmas present and his ditty about living life in the moment and appreciating every little thing; the song of having one more sleep until Christmas... all of them are unforgettable.The storytelling is superb. With the Great Gonzo playing the part of Charles Dickens himself, telling the story as it unfolds, and the part of Scrooge's old business partner, made into two partners so that the two old hecklers could do it together... perfection.But none of this really matters. None of it matters if the heart of the tale is gone. You can get all of the right people, all of the right gimmicks and still fail. Examples include that piece of cow dung that Bill Murray put out, SCROOGED. Believe me, this tale has been attempted a hundred times -- plays, movies... but none capture the magic of Dickens like this one. It has a heart as big as the story. And in the end, it captured mine. I watch this movie every year -- I get my family together, and we spend a night sharing stories about one other and remembering how much we mean to each other. And then we watch this simple telling of a perfect Christmas story... Thank you, Brian Henson. Thank you for reminding me what Christmas is.

Instead of raging his hatred of Christmas he remarks on it with keen sarcasm. Dickens uses humor and irony throughout his writings and I truly enjoyed seeing it brought out in this movie. Maybe making it more amazing is that Mr. Caine gives this performance opposite the whole troupe of The Muppets. I am also impressed with how much of the content of the original story is included with the most important passages remaining intact. The Ghost of Christmas past is so true to Dickens' description, more so than any other version I've seen. Also interesting is that this character is mostly computer generated in a world of puppets. The Ghost of Christmas Present is completely infectious with the spirit of Christmas and I love the way he expands to fill any space he inhabits and gets smaller to relate to Scrooge. I find all of the songs enjoyable and high quality, the production numbers entertaining. This movie is also the best of its kind showing Ebenezer truly in love with Belle and the sadness of their parting. The Muppets are matched well to Dickens' characters and the performers are at their very best in this film.I love the cast and production of the film starring Reginald Owen from 1938 and it sets the bar for all other movies to be judged by. Alastair Sim (1951)is the scariest Scrooge and the movie has a very dark quality. I love Albert Finney as Scrooge in the 1970 musical, and look forward to Thank You Very Much being sung as the they parade through the streets and dance on the coffin. George C. Scott gives the character pathos and shows how truly haunted Scrooge is, not only by the ghosts but by his own past, while his conversion is subtle and believable. I watch each one of them portray Dickens' most famous character every year during the holidays and, in my opinion, Caine is simply the best Scrooge ever.note I purposely left Patrick Stewart's 1999 portrayal of Scrooge off the list, it doesn't rate being included among the greats.

He then reluctantly gave Cratchit and the rats Christmas day off.       That night, Scrooge trudged home and settled in his house for the night. Dickens and Rizzo watched through the window. All of a sudden, Scrooge was visited by the ghosts of his former partners Jacob and Robert Marley (Statler and Waldorf). They were bound in chains, for they were being punished for all the heartless deeds they performed in life. They told Scrooge he was in for the same fate unless he changed his ways. Three spirits would visit him that night to help him. The first would come at 100. Scrooge just shook it off, but at 100 A.M., the Ghost of Christmas Past showed up. She showed Scrooge his past himself as a lad at boarding school, then he watched himself grow up, graduate and become an apprentice to Mr. Fozziewig (Fozzie Bear) who owned a rubber chicken factory in town and it was at Fozziewig's Christmas party that Scrooge met the love of his life Belle. The two just hit it off, but after some time had passed, Scrooge's love for money replaced his love for Belle and he lost her. Present Scrooge was devastated and returned home, only to be visited next by the giant, jolly Ghost of Christmas Present who shows Scrooge his nephew Fred's family celebrating Christmas and speaking ill of Scrooge. Next to Bob Cratchit's house. Wife Emily (Miss Piggy) was cooking the meager dinner and the children helped. Then in came Bob and Tiny Tim (Robin). Tim was on crutches and quite ill. The spirit told Scrooge that if these shadows remained unaltered by the future, he saw a vacant seat where Tiny Tim once sat.       Then the spirit's time was up. He vanished and was replaced by the tall, mysterious Ghost of Christmas Future. Dickens and Rizzo backed out because this scene was too scary. The ghost showed Scrooge that Tiny Tim had died, so had someone else in town that nobody showed any sympathy for. Scrooge found out who the deceased was himself! He was terrified and vowed to make up for his sins. He then awakened in his own room on Christmas day! He immediately began spreading Christmas cheer around town, including his nephew Fred's house. He then visited the Cratchit's home and brought a large turkey. He gave Cratchit a raise, donated to the poor, and everything was A-OKAY! And Tiny Tim, who did not die, found a second father in Scrooge, and he observed, God bless us, Everyone.       Pretty good adaption of A Christmas Carol! Sadly, Jim Henson and Richard Hunt died before this began production. That's very tragic! Henson and Hunt used to do Statler and Waldorf, among many other Muppets and their replacements sound nothing like them! Michael Caine was good. He's a very good actor so he was a good Scrooge. Gonzo and Rizzo keep us updated on all that's happening. So this Christmas, I recommend The Muppet Christmas Carol! And, as Gonzo and Rizzo point out, if you liked this, you should read the book. And you should.- "},{"Title":"Muppet version of the famous Dickens story, good without reaching excellent.","Date":"2 November 2005","Score":"","Genre":"Comedy, Drama, Family","Review":" Following on from The Muppet Movie, The Muppets Take Manhattan and The Great Muppet Caper, this is Jim and Brian Henson's puppet version of the famous Charles Dickens story, A Christmas Carol. It is a story done many times for stage and screen, and this version is pretty faithful to the source material, though inevitably it does make simplifications in order to accommodate its intended juvenile audience. Michael Caine is a perfect choice for Ebenezer Scrooge and holds the film together well (not easy, I'm sure, when you're a living, breathing actor surrounded by furry puppets!)In Victorian London, miserly counting house boss Ebenezer Scrooge (Michael Caine) looks on in disgust as the citizens merrily prepare for Christmas. Since youth-hood, Scrooge has despised Christmas and what he deems to be the frivolity and excessive generosity associated with it. One of Scrooge's employees, Bob Crachit (Kermit The Frog), asks for time off on Christmas Day to be with his family, and is begrudgingly given it by his sour employer. However, Scrooge is visited later that night by the ghosts of his now-deceased partners Jacob and Robert Marley (Statler and Waldorf). They warn him that he needs to change his ways or else he faces eternal damnation. More ghosts visit him through the night in an attempt to show him the error of his ways. Firstly, the Ghost of Christmas Past who forces Scrooge to relive some of his acts of cruelty from Christmases gone by; secondly, the Ghost of Christmas Present, who shows Scrooge how his mean nature affects those around him; and thirdly, the Ghost of Christmas Future, who allows Scrooge a terrifying and heart-breaking glimpse of what will be if he continues to mistreat those he knows....The film is well-made and enjoyable in its simplistic way. Caine, as noted, is an outstanding choice for the Scrooge role. The production designs are also first-rate, including some well-designed wintry Victorian streets and some excellent interiors. There are a few things about the film that I find rather irritating, though, and as a result I've knocked my rating down to a 6. The linking device, which uses Gonzo as narrator Charles Dickens and saddles him a very unfunny sidekick called Rizzo the Rat, seems both unnecessary and heavy-handed. Also disappointing is the lack of screen time given to some of our favourite muppet characters. True enough, Kermit gets plenty of time as Bob Cratchit, but muppet legends like Miss Piggy, Fozzie Bear, the Animal, and Statler & Waldorf disappear from the action all too quickly. The central storyline here follows Scrooge, and since Scrooge is played by the human Caine, the muppets are reduced to brief guest roles.... and THAT seems a bit of a cheat when it is supposed to be a muppet movie. This is a worthwhile film and a nice, easy introduction to the story for viewers too young to read the book, but somehow I cant help thinking that it could have been better.

Gonzo narrates as Charles Dickens and Miss Piggy plays Mrs. Cratchit.This is more of a traditional retelling with the Victorian setting. It has a few jokes mostly from Gonzo and Rizzo. The songs aren't particularly catchy. I would prefer more from Muppets like Fozzi Bear. In general, I'm looking for something much more different from the Muppets with this traditional fare. It needs to be more kids friendly. This is fine for A Christmas Carol but it doesn't have the fun of the Muppets.

Why? Because I don't like most versions of the Dickens film because it's been overdone so many times that the story has practically become a cliché. Heck, there have been 95 versions of A Christmas CAROL!!! And, among the many versions were even ones that starred Mr. Magoo and Scrooge McDuck! Talk about overdoing things!!! Some of these variations are quite clever--most are not and are just cheap ways to get past writing original material. My feeling about THE MUPPET Christmas CAROL is that if you must see one, this is better than most though not as good as, in my opinion, the best version which stars George C. Scott*.Now, despite all my Scrooge-like comments, I cannot fault the film too much since despite the familiarity of the story, it's actually one of the better Muppet films. I was particularly impressed by the sets. The scenes of rooftops of London and the forest were all created on the sound stage and must have taken a tremendous amount of time and effort--and they are beautiful. Additionally, some of the other sets are amazing--such as the Cratchit house. They are just lovely. Likewise, I just loved the puppets--especially the Ghost of Christmas present. The only negative were that there were perhaps a few songs too many. Otherwise, a lovely family film overall.*While it is a very, very, very different version, I strongly recommend you see BLACKADDER'S Christmas CAROL. It is a wonderful variation on the old story--one where sweet, generous and kind Mr. Blackadder is accidentally turned into a selfish jerk by the same ghosts!

The title is a good indication of what viewers can expect from The Muppet Christmas Carol. Michael Caine is old miser Scrooge, who plays straight to a cast of everyone's favorite critters including Kermit the Frog, Miss Piggy, Fozzie Bear, Gonzo, and the rest of the gang. He's visited by three angels on Christmas Eve who teach him the importance of the holiday and showing good will toward men.The Muppet Christmas Carol isn't a bad movie. It's just another unnecessary re-telling of a classic Christmas tale. The concept of adapting Charles Dickens' short story and adding wacky characters or updating it was already played out even in 1992. I'm sure children will find it amusing, but their parents will be catching a quick nap amongst the tiny laughter.Michael Caine is absolutely perfect in the role of Scrooge. He pours his heart and soul into it. The fact that he is surrounded by Jim Henson's hand puppets doesn't affect his performance at all. As far as Caine's concerned, he's starring in a version of the famous tale surrounded by other Oscar-winning actors.The film provides good clean family entertainment for everyone.

One thing I should clarify, is that if you came to see the muppets, you will probably be disappointed. This film is all about Scrooge, who is played by a very human Michael Caine. This is truly, the biggest flaw in The Muppet Christmas Carol, because with the muppets getting so little screen time then they deserve, this adaption of the Dicken's story doesn't have much to separate itself from other adaptions. Gonzo narrates, and Rizzo the Rat is there to make jokes. This potentially amusing duo isn't very funny, and is only there to move the story along. In fact, they feel a lot like filler. And speaking of filler, did I mention all the songs in this movie? I believe there were 6 or 7 songs total. Though the one at the beginning is somewhat entertaining, and a genius number by the Marley brothers is highly enjoyable, most of the songs are tedious and dull. They exist only to extend the running time. You will be seeing a lot of Michael Caine, which should be obvious because he plays that star, Ebeneezer Scrooge. I expected to see more muppets than humans, but this proved incorrect. Michael Caine performs adequately as Scrooge, but in the end, his performance is a little underwhelming. Also, during the musical numbers, it always seems like he has nothing to do. When the muppets get into the act, the film is more enjoyable, but this certainly isn't first class muppet material. It feels like B-movie muppet material, and that was certainly a disappointment. The movie adapts the classic faithfully, and there are lots of fun scenes. And even among a lot of dull songs, there are a couple gems. I just expected so much more from the ever-dependable muppets, and I can't help but feel a little let down. Above average Christmas tale, under average muppet film.

Those familiar with the original story as well as countless other versions known that the story itself is a pretty dark one with some extremely violent moments that would make one seem inappropriate for children. There's even a joke by one of the Muppet's about it being too dark for kids but we then get a funny bit on the importance of the story. I'm sure some might complain that the really dark moments have been tamed down way too much but I guess these people didn't realize the word Muppet when they hit play. Overall this is an extremely entertaining version of the story and you can't help but smile when you see someone like Caine playing with the Muppet's. There are many very good scenes including, of course, the ending where Scrooge finally makes good to Bob Cratchit who is played by Kermit here. Fans of the Muppets are going to get a real kick out of seeing their favorite characters getting to play the part of famous people from the story. Some of the highlights are of course Kermit but we also get Fozzie Bear doing Fozziewig and who better than Gonzo and Rizzo to play hosts? I think the film made the right choice in letting the Muppets work their way around Caine who is the main star here. I think Caine does a very good job with the part and especially when you consider this is a kids movie and he wasn't allowed to go as far or as dark as some of the previous versions. It appears that the actor is having fun with his fake friends and it also seems as if he's in on the joke and willing to substitute some of the darker moments for lighter ones. I think some of the music is forgettable and there's a tad bit too much slapstick that gets in the way of the story but overall this is a pleasant little film that's perfect for the holidays.

Defeating competition from the likes of David Hemmings, Ron Moody and David Warner, Scrooge, then, is played by Michael Caine, who does well enough as the reformed miser, though he doesn't bring anything particularly novel to the role; indeed, the script seems to be drawing most on the definitive 1951 SCROOGE and the 1970 musical version of the same name &#150; this too, in fact, has a number of songs (the work of Paul Williams, written in his typically upbeat and catchy style).While the film does fall somewhat in the trap of not delivering enough of Scrooge or enough of The Muppets (Miss Piggy's role, for instance, would be much bigger in a more typical effort), it's generally enjoyable with a fair number of funny bits the very opening scene with a number of aristocrats patting themselves on the back for a great supper thinking on what they should do next and one of them suggests they have lunch; Rizzo thanking Dickens/Gonzo for making him a part of the story (even if only to clean the outer window of Scrooge's office!); Scrooge's terrified employees transforming themselves instantly into sun-loving beach-goers when the former complains about their overconsumption of coal; the charity-seeking carol-singer in whose face Scrooge shuts his door is later shown freezing out in the street; etc. Ironically, from what I recall of the various versions of the story I've watched, this one provides the most satisfactory depiction of the Ghost Of Christmas Present he's even given the film's best song!); incidentally, Caine does a unremarkable bit of singing himself.

It was about the making of itself. At one point there is a fight and Kermit gets tossed around into the piano. (The piano player is the film's composer.) Kermit looks directly at the camera and says ` I hope you appreciate that I am doing my own stunts!'Jim Henson did not invent folded realities in film, but he surely was a key innovator. He took this notion pretty far with his ambitious experiments in `Labyrinth' and `Dark Crystal,' both failures in the end. The high point was the `Muppet Movie' which was directed by a `real' director. Since Jim's death and the entrance of Disney, all the creative steam is gone and we are left with simple exploitation. The kind of folding Henson had in mind can never be repeated, so this project starts off with a structural handicap.Meanwhile, Charles Dickens. He invented much of what Modern Christmas is. (Santa Claus' appearance and importance would be invented later by Coke.) The magic of Dickens is that he is totally without irony in the story, or folding if you will. He creates characters and lets them bump up against each other on their own accord. The whole thing works because it is without folding.Now these two world-creating paths (folding and antifolding) meet and do a good job of temporarily merging. It is this merged world to which we are introduced in the first few minutes. The clever idea here is that a muppet portrays the writer, the creator of what we see. Gonzo is a fabricated actor who acts the writer of the story. He both creates the characters and intermingles with them as a created character himself. As a clever idea, is is a rehash of older muppetry, but it works at least so far as making a watchable film.As it develops, in addition to the muppet narrator, it folds several other layers familiar muppets acting parts, humans acting parts (Scrooge and girlfriend, Nephew and wife), newly created puppets who are not muppets acting some parts (the ghosts). The oddness of Dickens characters as created by him smoothly meshes with the similar oddness of Henson's exaggerated characters. That alone makes this the second most successful project in the muppet world. `Treasure Island' for instance, tried a similar trick and failed because Stevenson built his characters a different way.There are three or four muppet jokes inserted that do not derive from the story. But because we have a real narrator, we can get more of the actual language of Dickens' written word. And oddly, that makes this one of the most successful `Carol's on film in spite of Caine's excesses.The songs are dreadful except for the appearance of Marley (here as brothers).Bottom line it is neither good Dickens nor good Henson. But no stage or film drama is good Dickens anyway, so if all you want is a sentimental echo of the real thing, this will do better than most.Ted's Evaluation -- 2 of 4 Has some interesting elements.

Prior to this, Caine's movies weren't exactly family orientated, at least not for an age group below five, so this is a welcome addition. The 'story' needs no introduction, and as well as being a Christmas classic, has also been remade and redone countless times for the cinema. What will remain unique about this version without doubt are the muppets. I think the muppets still work well, despite advances Hollywood continues to make in terms of animation and new technology. There's just something unique about them and therefore they don't even fall between the two stools of Pixar and the classic Disney style. The muppets will forever remain timeless and a source of fixation for young children, essentially because the cleverness is having them appear in scenes opposite real life actors which gives them credibility and clout. So, what of this movie? Well, Caine is sufficiently nasty and cold hearted as bad old Ebeneezer, perhaps not as menacing as Jack Carter but distinctly unpleasant nevertheless. Caine himself has said in the past that the scripts that interest him the most are when the main character undergoes a huge change, so in that respect he wouldn't get a better one than this. Caine skilfully displays the changes needed, and he is a joy to watch. Unlike most Scrooges, Caine's post-ghost Scrooge is actually more convincing than the original, and his happiness in the final scenes of the movie are heart warming, and yes, he even tries his hand at singing, surely a first. There is also a delightful in-joke, as when Caine / Scrooge makes his way to Bob Cratchit's house on Christmas Day, he passes a shop called 'Micklewhites', which, was, of course, his original surname. Two final things I must share here. I recall when this was first shown on terrestrial television, the Radio Times movie review summed up its piece by using the phrase 'Caine hasn't been this good in ages'. Well, perhaps I am naïve, but nearly twenty years later it was shown on television on Christmas Day and once again I came across the exact same review. I know I shouldn't really expect resident publication film critics to come up with different reviews time and again for movies that are on all the time (The Mummy anyone?), but it really did make me gasp. Well, I did say I was naïve. Oh, and now for the second piece of sacrilege. It's Miss Piggy. Is it just me, or is anyone else irritated by this character? I nearly said 'her' but that would be falling into the trap. I'm talking about the countless times this 'creature' appears on chat shows and the audience and fellow guests whoop in faux delight, regularly claiming to be in the presence of a superstar. Er&#x85;no. You're not. She / it is a puppet (ok, muppet). It isn't real! Get over it, and stop this ridiculous myth. I feel the same way about Dame Edna Everage (get over it, it's a bloke dressed up in womens clothes) and don't seem to find anyone prepared to share the same view.

Made in 1992, I watched it in 2010 (and again in 2011) and it could have been made yesterday... it just really carries the spirit of timelessness.Great songs, great use of Muppets (especially Rizzo). And who can say anything bad about Michael Caine? George Carlin was considered for the part of Scrooge, and I want to see what that would be like, but you can never go wrong with Caine. I cannot name a single failure in his career. This is one of his greatest performances, as well... and it is truly an honor to appear alongside Muppets, I imagine.The film is available in two versions theatrical widescreen, and extended full-screen. I suggest the widescreen, not only because the picture is better, but because the only scene cut is of a woman singing, and her song and voice are not high points whatsoever.The DVD is worth owning for the special features. A short feature on the life of Gonzo and another short on Christmas Around the World. I wish they had both been longer, but they were still a nice treat. There is also a commentary, though I have not yet had the chance to check that out.Please, check this out and share it with your kids. It is more kid-friendly than some versions of Christmas Carol (although Christmas Past is a bit creepy) and you cannot go wrong with that.

Scott version or the tv movie Patrick Stewart starred in. But Muppet Christmas Carol proves to be well done and just as good as it's predacessors. It shows the Muppets can continue without their beloved creator Jim Henson, even though we all wish he was still here. Anyway, the film proves inventive and clever. Thumbs up. "},{"Title":"Bah Humbug!","Date":"30 December 2006","Score":"2 out of 7 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Drama, Family","Review":" It is Christmas Eve, and miserly Ebeneezer Scrooge is visited by the Ghosts of Christmas Past, Present, and Future in attempt to get him to change his ways.Dicken's classic tale gets the Muppet treatment, with Michael Caine taking the role of Scrooge, but most of the other characters being played by Jim Henson's famous felt creations. Whilst the story remains fairly faithful to Dickens' novel (although it is simplified somewhat for a younger audience), the lack of really good jokes and the inclusion of some rather forgettable songs (by Paul Williams) made this film rather disappointing for me.Caine is superb as Scrooge but his Muppet co-stars are just not up to their zany best. Gonzo (as Dickens) and Rizzo the Rat narrate the tale and tend to interrupt the flow of proceedings, whilst Kermit, voiced by Steve Whitmire (not Jim Henson, who died two years earlier), just doesn't sound like the frog we know and love.The whole affair is rather sedate considering this is a Muppet movie and I found myself struggling to stay awake towards the end. More jokes and a little less singing and I may have enjoyed this one a little more. "},{"Title":"Doesn't add anything","Date":"29 July 2004","Score":"1 out of 7 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Drama, Family","Review":"  Dickens' Christmas Carol must have been filmed about 200 times right about now, and I'm sure those Hollywood executives will do so in the next century as well, as the story is quite a winner.So this is the Muppets interpretation of it, with Michael Caine in the role of Ebenezer Scrooge and Kermit as Bob Cratchit. Scrooge is mean, cold and cheap but he is visited by some ghosts, yada yada, and God bless us, everyone!Anyway, the Muppets don't really do anything special with the story so this one just blends in with all the other Christmas Carols. Not a standout movie for sure. 5/10.

But as a swede I have to hear Michael Caine talk with a swedish voice. I love The Muppet Show and Michael Caine but i don't wan't mixed with a swedish tounge. "}]
