Take the icon duo of Frankie and Annette put them in a parody of their own genre add a half dozen cameos from some of the most memorable characters 60's T.V. had to offer add some great casting especially the role of Bobby (Demian Slade) and you have Back to the Beach. Frankie is an over worked car dealer Annette is an overly optimistic housewife- they opt to take a trip to Hawaii stopping along the way in L.A. to visit their eldest daughter who happens to live on the very beach they once romped as teens. Did I mention their son Bobby (an ashamed to be Frankie and Annettes son donning punk garb and attitude) tags along creating the punchiest of the punchlines and the films narration. There on the beach Frankie finds his daughter dating a surfer and an old flame losing Annette in the process while ticking off the local beach roughians. The plot is great as a parody with the perfect couple playing the leads while the story plays out in old beach film fashion.It's risqu√© enough to keep your eyes open but innocent enough in dialogue to show a six year old. Sure the acting is over the top but didn't I mention this was a parody of the beach films. Add to this a great musical score including Dick Dale and Stevie Ray Vaughn and you have not so much a great film as a very watchable/researchable one. Is it as good as say Requiem For a Dream no of course not but let me ask how often can you really watch a man lose his arm while his girl friend reverts to public sodomy for drug money...Go for the FUN!! Go watch Back To The Beach, you won't be disappointed!!!!!

Done as a combination homage/spoof to these early/mid 60's drive-in specials, the movie reunites some of the principle players and revisits the myth of California as Shangri-La.Annette, Frankie, Connie and dozens of guests in cameo roles gently rib the genre and themselves. As usual, Annette and Frankie have some difference of opinions and go off in different directions--even though they have been married for 20 years. Their plots to make each other jealous and the ultimate reconciliation are no surprise, but still make for a pleasant 90 minutes.Annette and Connie are as lovely as ever.

In a recent communication, Nor commented on how this film always made him `feel good', and how many films can `honestly make that claim?'Now, when Back to the Beach first came to our local theatre some 17 years ago, I remember accompanying my little sister to the mall venue and having a fluff of a good time. I couldn't recall for you any of the characters or storyline if confronted on the street today, but as I roll my eyes upwards to try and recall this sand castle of a movie, I am not left with any resounding bad notions.Well, flip forward to 2004 and Paramount Studio's is finally releasing Back to the Beach on DVD to what I can only expect was little pressure (sorry, Nor).  I doubt there was a lengthy petition nor do I expect that there was a rampage outside the Studio gates looking to free this film from its dust ridden resting place.  However, now that its back, what better way to start off the summer than putting this small gem into the DVD player and being reminded of a simpler, more innocent time.  Playing on Saturday afternoon television every so often, you may not require a detailed review of the films storyline, but here goes&#133;Frankie and Annette have grown from their beach personas and are now living in Ohio.  They return to L.A. to visit their daughter who to their surprise, is living with her boyfriend.  To further add stress and tension, Frankie bumps into Connie (an old friend) who still has the hots for him and soon Frankie and Annette's marriage is on the rocks.  All comes to a head when a group of thugs teams up with Frankie and Annette's rebellious son and challenge the father (known only to us in the film as the Big Kahuna), to a surfing contest.  Back to the Beach's script could probably been written on a post-it note, but that doesn't mean we are not going to have some fun along the way.  Interweaved through all the 80's fashion crazes are old television stars and even a 60's type musical number on the beach that if you don't watch out, will have you tapping your feet to the Jamaica SKA.  Blink and you might miss Bob Denver and the late Alan Hale (Gilligan and the Skipper for you younger folk), Pee Wee Herman, Don Adams (Get Smart), Barbara Billingsly, Tony Dow and Jerry Mathers (Leave it to Beaver).  Even Stevie Ray Vaughn and O.J. Simpson can be seen if you don't take washroom breaks. Now, I will be the first to admit that throwing a bunch of stars into a movie doesn't necessarily make for a good time, but the fact that none of these accredited actors take themselves seriously, means that the audience too can sit back and enjoy the performance.  When Bob Denver continues to play up his Gilligan character he made famous, it takes us back even further to childhood memories of sitting in front of the 13 inch black and white television rooting for the castaways to eventually find their way off the island.Back to the Beach is not for all tastes and that was evident even back in '87 when the movie only grossed $13 million (granted, it was released on the same date as Dirty Dancing so it sort of slipped into the background).  The humor is definitely roll-your-eyeish and the corny surfing scene in the climax kind of left me with a bad taste in my mouth.  Most younger viewers won't get the inside jokes either like when Annette goes to the cupboard and pulls out a jar of SKIPPY peanut butter (she was their commercial spokesperson back in the early 80's) and that might take away from some of the films appeal.However, for a fun time in the vein of Saturday Night Live where each scene sets itself up as a skit &#150; some work, some don't &#150; it's not a bad way to say &#145;hello' to the summer.

It's not so much a beach party, more of a tsunami of poop.EisensteinWhat a poetic analogy to end on. 4 out of 10.

Hear that Ebert, Roeper and Company?","Date":"5 June 2008","Score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Musical","Review":" The preeminence of a formerly strictly Black type of Music had been with us for well over a decade when the New Song & Dance form, now known as Rock 'n' Roll was forever fused with the Movies.The Southern California Surfing Scene, the New Mores of permitting the Exhibition and viewing of highly Semi-Nude Human form on the screen and the Economic$ and Realitie$ that possibly for the first time in our history, the Adolescent or Teen Ager was beginning to show that it was to show that it was His/Her expendable Ca$h Dollar$ that were a, if not THE, number factor in the Movie Business.The resulting type of Film Genre, the Teen-Age Beach Movie. In the brief period of 3-5 years we were treated to such spectacles as BEACH PARTY, HOW TO STUFF A WILD BIKINI, BEACH BLANKET BINGO, MUSCLE BEACH PARTY; 'B' Films all and all from the gang over at American-International Pictures.* All designed to be shown at that now nearly extinct institution known as The Drive-In Movie Theatre.**IT was a case of Formula Film to the Nth Degree. All that was needed was some Guitar-laden Rock 'n' Roll Music from some semi famous group, such as Lovin' Spoonful, the Buckinghams or the Mainliners. Add a Male and Female lead (how 'bout Annette Funicello & Frankie Avalon?)and a large group of (Woo,woo,woo,woo!) Stuffed Bikinis and a corresponding number of Athletic Male Swimmers and Surfers. Next we need some Comic Relief in the form of guys like Don Rickles, Buddy Hackett and the Great Stone Face (Himself), Silent Film Comedian, Buster Keaton; they all did Beach Films in that role. The last ingredient would be a Comic Villain and his cohorts. Harvey Lembeck filled that bill very well.The Producers of BACK TO THE BEACH wisely added to the retro-effect and enjoyment of the movie by having stocked the movie with plenty of Denizens of the '60's Scene. Edd Byrnnes ('Kookie' from 77 SUNSET STRIP), Connie Stevens, Alan Hale, Jr. & Bob Denver (Gilligan & Skipper), Tony Dowe (Wally), Jerry Mathers (the Beaver), Barbara Billingsley (June Cleaver), Don Adams (Maxwell Smart, Tennessee Tuxedo's voice)all make some pretty decent sized cameos. Added to the mix we have top Recording Guitarists Dick Dale and Rodney Bingeheimer; providing just for proper Musical Interest, Nostalgia and Authenticity.AS for a Contemporary component, they added a virtually pointless appearance by the then red-hot and very popular Paul Reubens (Pee-Wee Herman) to sing the old Rock 'n' Roll Classic, The Bird; and a now ironic spoof of the old Hertz Car Rental Commercials with old O.J. Simpson (himself); accurately lampooning his long running getting through the Airport commercials! THE Movie had been sort of prematurely panned and dismissed obviously by a large number of (Everybody, Hurry and Genuflect) Critics who had never even screened it. This hurt it bat the Box Office and by the time that word had gotten out about its true merits, it was headed for Videoland.BACK TO THE BEACH is a truly amusing production and is worthy to be classified with the Modern Comedy work of Messers Woody Allen, Mel Brooks and the Team of Zucker,Abrahams & Zucker.WE now would be all ready to roll the film. And they were highly successful during that brief period. Hence, this Parody-Send Up-Tribute to the whole bunch of films.BACK TO THE BEACH (Paramount, 1987) provides us with a gentle and truly funny film that answers a lot of the heretofore unanswered questions, like What happens to old Surfers? Is the Beach still open? Did those two Love Birds ever marry? What about the Next Generation? Is 'Kookie' still parkin' them cars? So just remember how they started filming their Beach Scenes with Lights, Camera, and EVERYBODY TWIST!NOTE * American-International or A.I.P. for short; now how could we forget them? They were probably responsible for more Pictures that we DIDN'T WATCH at the Drive-Ins than the other Companies Films we DID SEE!NOTE ** There was even an A Film Beach Movie with DON'T MAKE WAVES (Filmways/MGM, 1967). It was a Top shelf Production with a first rate cast including Tony Curtis, Claudia Cardinalle, Robert Webber, Sharon Tate, Dave draper, Chet Yorton, Reg Lewis, China Lee, Mort Sahl, Dub Taylor, Joanna Barnes, Jim Backus & Henny Backus (Mr. & Mrs. Jim Backus-uncredited.)

Dangerous! Oh man, does this movie not work properly, it's broken in so many ways and broken so fundamentally, there is no fixing it other than using fire- fire to burn it all away.

If they had really gone out and tried to lampoon the source like THE BRADY BUNCH MOVIE, it could have been great. The beach could've been like that David Lee Roth CALIFORNIA GIRLS video and we could've had some more risque humor.

I did. It was Back to the Beach. I thought that Pee Wee Herman's cameo was hilarious! Ditto for Frankie and Annette's surly son Bobby. This is when I was 10! I recently watched it as an adult and found that Frankie and Annette's continual fighting was childish, and NOT funny. I found Bobby really annoying. It's a great movie if you're looking for a show the whole family can watch together, but personally, I wouldn't watch it alone unless I was ready for a nap.

It has guest spots and musical numbers galore but, unlike the themes in Grease, for instance, this doesn't have the impact or widespread appeal to be wildly successful; it just doesn't work. The film has a very weak script, which certainly was no help to the director, and the scenes don't build any momentum. Even the nostalgia-factor in seeing Avalon and Funicello together again is low (where's the chemistry? All they do here is bicker). A lot of people put their time and talent into this picture, but it doesn't soar, doesn't spark fond memories. It's a wash-out. *1/2 from **** "},{"Title":"Beach, Blanket, Boring!","Date":"15 March 1999","Score":"1 out of 5 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Musical","Review":"  The onetime beach partiers, now parents, return to the sandy paradise where it all began.

It seems to be some sort of parody, but it is so self-conscious in its pastiche - yet at the same time oblivious at how stupid it is - that it fails on all levels.  It is basically a love letter to the the worst elements of pop culture in 1987, with a layer of kitschy 1960s references on top.  The lowlight is surely the Jamaica Ska number, in which Fishbone humiliates itself as Annette instructs the beach-goers in jazzercising.  It is reeeeeallllly painful.

No, this reunion isn't worth watching.  It is produced by Frankie and Annette, and thus primarily self-serving.  The director has been involved with only a handful of projects over the years, and the lack of experience is evident.Cameos by Gilligan, Skipper, Don Adams, and the Leave It to Beaver gang are forced.  Pee Wee's little number is more in tune with the 50s-in-the-80s funkiness of the script.It's an innocent romp, but will appeal only to those who are hardcore fans of the original 60s Beach flicks.  Psycho Beach Party actually did the retro thing much better, but that R-rated film with a drag queen as the lead sure won't make too many of you happy.
