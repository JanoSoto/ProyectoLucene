Welcome to my review on a very underrated movie. Celtic Pride was released in the fun year of 1996. It stars Daniel Stern, Dan Akroyd and Damon Wayons. Now, Daniel Stern is an extraordinarily funny actor and a great one in retrospective. Dan Akroyd is also an awesome actor who actually signed my DVD of this film when he was on a world tour. The film is very funny and the comedic acting is legendary. I think anyone who's seen this film probably disagrees with the 5.1. I rate this film a 7.2 for its memorable style and character which is hard to find in movies these days. I definitely recommend having this film in your collection as you can watch it over and over again. Click if this review was useful to you if you go for the Milwalkie Bucks. If not that, I go for the Green bay Packers in the N.F.L, San Jose Sharks in the N.H.L and mildly follow the A.F.L, my team there are the Fremantle Dockers... And so, be sure to check out my upcoming reviews for anticipated films like The Amazing Spiderman 2, Godzilla, X Men IV, Dawn of the Planet of the Apes, The Hobbit part 3 and more!

This is a different kind of sports comedy where the excitement isn't coming from the players, but two rabid fans of the Boston Celtics.Dan Akroyd and Daniel Stern play Mike and Jimmy, two hardcore fans of the Boston Celtics. The Celts are in the finals with the Utah Jazz and their star player selfish, ballhog Lewis Scott (Wayans). After losing game six, it's on to game seven where either the Celts or the Jazz will become the champions. So Mike and Jimmy go to a nightclub after the game, and get drunk with Scott, before they wake up in Mike's basement with him tied up, and no recollection of the events that took place the night before.Mike and Jimmy find out from their cop-buddy (Guilfoyle) that kidnapping is kidnapping no matter what time they let the victim go. So they think they should show something for it, and hold Lewis till after game seven so the Celts have a good shot of winning. Their plan goes awry when the cad starts playing mind-games with the two in order to disassemble their longtime friendship.This is one of the comedies you have to search under the bed for. Even with Akroyd, Stern, and Wayans on the cover this film is usually lost in the dust compared to Akroyd's others like The Great Outdoors and Ghostbusters. This isn't better than those two works of comedic gold, but they do present the same feel-good aspect and have a warm, fuzzy, classic feeling to them.The pairing of Dan Akroyd and Daniel Stern wasn't unlikely at the time, and they do a good job at being the two buddies. The funniest stuff is from Damon though as he continues to play games with Mike's head saying that you're his bitch and consistently taunts him. Thankfully, the movie isn't just made up of these games because if it was, I don't think we could call this a buddy comedy.Now that it's 2011, I was surprised to see Judd Apatow's name all over this film as producer, story creator, and writer. The current generation knows Apatow for making heartfelt, with an essence of raunch and silly comedy-drama premises. In the nineties, he was more about the laughs than the drama. Celtic Pride can also serve as a time capsule of a different time in a film-maker's life.Celtic Pride doesn't over-shoot or overstay its welcome. It runs for a comfortable ninety-one minutes, and it goes by quickly. A different side of sports comedies adding flavor and a good amount of heart, Celtic Pride has green and white blood pumping thru its veins.Starring Dan Akroyd, Daniel Stern, and Damon Wayans. Directed by Tom DeCerhio.

Lifelong fans Mike O'Hara and Jimmy Flaherty may have personal problems but these are put in perspective opposite the dream of catching the title.  However Utah's best player, Lewis Scott, is carrying the team and responsible for most of their points.  When he destroys the Celtics in game 6, things look bleak.  Bumping into him in a bar later that night, Mike and Jimmy plan to get him so drunk he'll still he weak in several days time when game 7 is played.  However when they wake up beside him the next morning they kidnap him and plan to hold him until after game 7 has passed.  However things are harder than they imagined.Being a basketball fan I'll give anything that involves the game a try, whether it is more serious films like Blue Chips and He Got Game or comedies like this or Eddie.  This film had potential and, opening with a funny sequence where Mike fails to pass on his passion to his students, it looked like it was going to be good.  The plot is filled out by poking fun at the excessive sports fans and also taking a more serious look from the point of view of the players themselves (as represented by Scott).  However, where things fall down a little is in the delivery.Marketed as a `wacky' comedy of sorts, the film wants to be that (hence the presence of Aykroyd and Stern) but this means that the more interesting side of the film is ignored and allowed to fall into disrepair (before finally collapsing in the final `7 months later' shot).  As a comedy it is entertaining without ever being very funny &#150; I didn't laugh out loud very often but I found it passable and light hearted.  It never really gets any better than that sadly, but I felt that this lack of consistent laughs could have been covered if the darker side of the fan/player relationship had been brought out more.Unfortunately this side slides for the whole of the film until nothing of interest is really left.  There are imaginative touches that suggest a better film, but overall the lack of an effective dramatic streak to the film (no matter how secondary it would have been) is a problem.  Without it the plot seems trivial and makes it harder to hold the audience's interest. This isn't helped by the fact that the film feels quite cheap and quickly put together.  This is shown throughout the film but is clearest in it's portrayal of the basketball action.  I wasn't expecting them to have the feel of a big stadium or have total realism, but the games are such a joke (in terms the play) that it made me realise how little effort was put into some aspects of the film.The cast is OK but the names suggest that a more `zany' comedy was expected to be the outcome of this film.  Aykroyd plays a lesser role but has some good dream sequences, Stern is left to lead the film and he appears to lack the confidence to do it well.  Wayans is the real star here which is a worrying thing.  His character is the strongest and also has the most to say as he is not just a comedy figure in the way the other two are.  He leads well and is actually OK but his basketball scenes are poor.  For He Got Game, Ray Allen coached Washington so he'd look the part, it appears no-one saw the need for that approach here.Overall this is a wacky comedy with few laughs.  Because it seems to favour the `zany' knockabout side of it's nature, it neglects the darker more interesting side and suffers as a result.  This film never made it to the cinema in the UK and barely made an impact on video &#150; there are reasons for this.

Having said that it was enjoyable up until the end. I am a Boston Celtics fan (that is why I watched this movie) and just an over all sports fan, and I know you can not lie to your self about the team you are rooting for while watching a game. The fact that they were genuinely rooting for the Jazz by the end of the movie just seemed stupid and un-realistic. This is how the movie should have went in my opinion. Damon Wayans should have been the straight up bad guy throughout the film. They became like friends in the end, but there really was no reason to. They had a few moments of connection while he was being held, but not really enough to start a friend ship. So Mike and Jimmy should have come to the game rooting for the Jazz, but then realized they had to much Celtic Pride (it's the name of the movie) and cheered the Celtics. The only reason they didn't was because they were gonna go to jail which was kinda selfish. These two die hard fans should have cheered on the Celtics, the Celtics should have won, and they should have gone to jail. However the jail would be all fun and rowdy because it is a bunch of Bostonians pumped about the Celtics. Mike and Jimmy would be considered heroes amongst the inmates for what they did.

Mike is also obsessed, because he ended up a gym teacher rather than having a pro basketball career.  He scares the kids at his school, and his wife Carol wants him out of the house.The devoted Celtics fans go to what may be the last game in the arena before its demolition, the game that could win their team the NBA championship.  But the Celtics lose, despite all of Jimmy's and Mike's efforts--switching seats depending on whether the game is even or odd, and depending on which half it is.  Demanding that a man who arrived during halftime leave because the Celtics have been playing poorly since he got there. Even persuading the fans to spread out and leave them the only ones in their section of the arena.There's only one way to make sure the Celtics win the final game  when they see Utah Jazz star Lewis Scott drinking in a bar, they pretend to be fans and persuade him to get drunk so he won't be at his best for the game.  That plan doesn't go as well as hoped, and the results are hilarious.Damon Wayans was great as the conceited Lewis, especially in a Nike commercial satirizing Charles Barkley's comments about not wanting to be a role model (the commercial was later parodied in a funny dream where Jimmy was a celebrated plumber).  He considered Jimmy and Mike to be a couple of losers who weren't worth anything, and because he had the talent, he was entitled to whatever he had, and they were entitled to nothing. Dan Aykroyd was okay as Jimmy, but you couldn't tell from this that he ever got an Oscar nomination.  Daniel Stern started out terrible as Mike but got better.  The overall results were good if you just want to watch a fun movie without caring whether anyone has talent.Possible SpoilerLarry Bird walked up as the guys were making a big deal over Lewis, and it was so painful for these obsessed Celtics fans to have to pretend in front of possibly the greatest Celtics player ever--making Bird ashamed!DEFINITE SPOILER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Once Lewis is allowed to go back to his team, he promises not to turn the guys in for kidnapping if they promise to root for him and his team.

It was as if it was never content with where it was, always wanting to move forward, anticipating any possible flaw that may come along the way. It seemed scared to go for any big laughs, afraid it might be shot down by picky film-goers. In the process it did, in fact, hurt itself even more by anticipating this.Mike (Daniel Stern) and Jimmy (Dan Aykroyd) are big-time Boston Celtics fans. They get mood swings when the Celtics are losing, they get all-time-highs when they are winning. Mike's wife has even left him because he is so wrapped up around the sport. In the beginning of the movie, the Celtics and the Utah Jazz are about to play the sixth game of the NBA championships. Mike and Jimmy, eagerly anticipating and looking forward to the game, get front-row seats and watch in horror as the Jazz's newest player, Lewis Scott (Damon Wayans), completely owns the court and practically beats the Celtics by himself. Mike and Jimmy woefully retreat to a local bar, where they find that Lewis Scott is drinking. Posing as enthusiastic Utah fans, Mike and Jimmy push Scott to drink more and more, getting him extremely drunk. There's a funny scene during this when Mike and Jimmy meet Larry Byrd and have to pretend that they are Utah fans. The real big sports fans out there might get a kick out of that, and even the whole movie, but only the strong ones.After their late-night drinking binge, Mike and Jimmy take Scott back to their home, and eventually kidnap him, holding him hostage in Jimmy's apartment.Damon Wayans, star of Bulletproof and Major Payne, is surprisingly the funniest guy in this movie. He reminds me of the black version of my uncle, both in looks, humor and facial expressions. He gets the good one-liners, the good jokes. And it's funny to watch him be suspicious of everyone, such as when Mike and Jimmy originally approach him. Watch his face. His eyebrow arches, he talks sarcastically. I must say I was surprised.But Dan Aykroyd and Daniel Stern, both men I generally like in comedies, seem to just go with the flow, not really helping out the movie a lot. They are supposed to be long-time buddies and sports fanatics, but we don't feel any mutual sports bond between them, or just a bonding of friendship. The actors themselves are fine, but fail to deliver any sparks of chemistry.Celtic Pride is too heavy on itself. It's too serious, too melodramatic, too anti-climatic. It is as if director Tom De Cerchio is afraid to try anything risky for big laughs. Something like There's Something About Mary may not be the funniest movie ever (I certainly didn't think so), but the laughs were controversial and made the film more than worth seeing. Celtic Pride is just another average, run-o'-the-mill comedy. Ho-hum laughter result from ho-hum gags. There's nothing very funny here. It's basically for the very big sports fanatics, the kind of fanatics who would ritualistically kill off opposing team players just for their team to win. The premise of this movie is no doubt very funny in itself, but one single premise cannot a good movie make.2.5/5 stars -John Ulmer "},{"Title":"A Good Idea but a Bad Movie","Date":"25 October 2004","Score":"4 out of 12 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Sport","Review":" Celtic Pride is a good example of a movie that is doomed to go straight to video and cable.

While Wayans is one of the only funny things about the movie, the story fails to have him as a major part to the story. Stern and Aykroyd are good supporting actors when they team up with other actor like Billy Crystal and Chevy Chase. Alone, or even together, they do not have the chemistry that makes comedy teams.

If you agree with my opinion of them, you'll agree the movie is a waste of time. If you think I'm being too harsh, give the movie a chance. But friends shouldn't make friends watch Celtic Pride. It's so much worse than Juwanna Mann.

Two guys, one of them Dan Akroyd and his buddy, kidnap the winner of the team,played by Michael Jordan, but release him, after having second thoughts about what they are doing.  Just a boisterous film with plenty of basketball.  5/10 "},{"Title":"Flagrant Foul","Date":"3 January 2004","Score":"1 out of 7 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Sport","Review":"  Pointless comedy about two big time Celtics fans kidnapping a star player (Wayans, who could only post up Spud Webb or Muggsy Bogues). Not good, but we don't really make basketball movies with an eye towards the Scottish market.

Its unbelievable that there are grown men with supposed educational degrees out there that think the simplest plot synopsis of this movie can actually fly.  Bring your barf suppresant and thank me later.This woof of a movie presents dan aykroyd and daniel stern who could shoot their agents and rightfully receive congressional medals of honor.  Even damon wayans, the least antagonistic ingredient in this ghastly contrived slop, doesnt deserve the painful placement of hackened actor turned hero in the end.There is no simply no reason for anyone who isnt under the tutelage of leopold von sacher-masoch to view this movie.   If you havent seen this movie, consider yourself blessed and depart yourself forever from it.A negative 5 stars.

This tape got slammed-dunked in the garbage pail, where it belongs.I was totally offended at Dan Ackroyd making several out-and-out extremely bigoted anti-Christian statements, designed for cheap laughs that would never be permitted had he been denigrating any other religion or race or group. If that wasn't enough, we get a guy holding a sign with Scripture reference acting rude and then getting beat up....for laughs again. Incredible. This movie doesn't stop there. We also see a black guy yelling racist remarks that a white person would never get away with saying, and rightly so.....but in Hollywood, these double standards still exist.It turns out the only funny thing in the movie was the parody of fans who take sports too seriously. That was the idea behind the story, so why all the religious cheap shots?

The answer is Mark Williams . I bet you never knew thatDo you see the point I`m making ? No one in America is interested in snooker and I doubt if few people outside America are all that interested in basketball so what`s the chances of a comedy featuring The Boston Celtics becoming an international blockbuster ? CELTIC PRIDE  has limited international appeal As a Scotsman my interest in basketball matches matches my interest in polo ie zero interest , but that shouldn`t stop me from disliking this movie out of hand . The reason I disliked it was almost entirely down to the performances of Daniel Stern and Dan Akroyd whose idea of comedy acting is to pull funny faces , wave their hands around and talk very loudly and very fast . They`re not funny I`m afraid , and I don`t know if it`s the fault of the script or the director but there`s a somewhat episodic feel in locations. I thought most of the movie was going to take place in a basketball court , but it doesn`t . Then action then moves to a nightclub which led me to believe most of the story was going to take place their , but it doesn`t . The action then moves to a kidnappers house which led me to believe the rest of the story was going to take place there , but it doesn`t which had me noticing that the changes in location had a rather strange feel to them . Maybe it`s just me Don`t watch this unless you`re interested in basketball in general and The Boston Celtics in particular because you`ll find little to enjoy  "}]
