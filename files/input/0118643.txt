Again Gabriel seeks to end mankind's reign on Earth, but instead of searching for the perfect evil soul to achieve his ends, Gabriel is now in search of the one thing that can defeat him a Nephilim, a being born of a human woman and an angel. Los Angeles nurse Valerie Rosales (Jennifer Beales) is the mother of this being, having been impregnated by the angel Danyael (Russell Wong), who now seeks to protect Valerie from Gabriel. As in the first film, Gabriel is (quite hilariously) inept when it comes to modern technology, so he enlists the services of Izzy (Britney Murphy), a depressed teenager whom he resurrects after she commits suicide.The Prophecy II was seriously lacking in the story ideas established in the first film. Thomas Daggett, the hero from that film, appears briefly, only to meet a horrible end at the hands of Gabriel. (Sorry for the spoiler, but I personally feel this is a minor plot point.) Yet, the film was still entertaining, even though it might take a while for viewers to piece things together. Christopher Walken is simultaneously quirky and creepy as always, while Jennifer Beals, Russell Wong, Britney Murphy, and Eric Roberts (as the angel Michael) deliver decent performances. While the story lines from the first movie were dismissed in this film, this sequel sort of makes up for that by continuing the Nephilim concept established here in the third installment, The Prophecy III The Ascent. All in all, I give The Prophecy II a 5 out of 10 on a scale of 1 to 10 in my humble opinion.

I am glad I did, because I had been walking past that box on the shelf at the video store for a few years. After viewing that, I had to see the second. So, two nights ago, I rented the second one. I just watched this movie, got on the IMDb, and read all of the user reviews. I must say that I am shocked to see how many people did not like this sequel. To anyone who cannot understand the plot, I ask why? It is so simple! Christopher Walken returns as Gabriel, and once again shows us why he is one of the greatest actors of all time (and one of my personal favorites). The beautiful Brittany Murphy gives an untouchable performance, and her scenes with Walken are definitely ones to see. Russell Wong and Jennifer Beals also give good performances. The dialogue, though penned by another screenwriter, is just as good as the first. When I watched the movie, I had no idea it was another writer - I thought it was the same guy! While I think the first movie was slightly better, this is definitely a worthy sequel. I can't wait to rent part 3!***** Warning Spoilers Ahead!!! *****To all those people who can't understand the plot, maybe you should give the movie another watch.

One side is envious of the gifts God has bestowed upon humankind and basically wants to wipe out the human race, the other thinks be cool Mun, and just wants everyone to get along.In the first film there was an evil soul that could turn the tide of the angelic war if it fell in the wrong hands.In this film there is also something that might provide a great advantage to either side, in this case it is an unborn child, and this time as we are told early in the piece the war between angels has come to Earth.Thomas Daggett, the ex-priest turned cop from the first film has understandably lost the plot and is holed up in a monastery mumbling to himself nonsensically and scribbling down his visions. (He has also changed from Elias Koteas to some other actor.)This film revolves around a young woman named Valerie (Jennifer Beales), who looks very much like Valerie Madsen from the first film, only if she was a brunette and had longer hair. Anyway in this film Val is driving along minding her own business when she hits a guy. Now I won't say he was a pedestrian because he wasn't walking, he literally fell from the sky, being a film about angels we can guess where he has come from...His name is Danyael, and when a distraught Val takes him to the hospital he is friendly enough to mouth Don't be afraid as he is wheeled into the emergency room, despite the fact that he should be all types of f*cked up.Meanwhile Tommy Daggett continues to be crazy with all the visions.There is a cool Terminator scene where someone is seemingly born from beneath the Earth's surface, somewhere fiery and dare I say it hellish?Good old Gabriel is back baby!! (At least they had the sense to bring back the best character from the first film, although while filming this Christopher Walken must have missed out on another 4 or 5 crappy films that he would ordinarily have taken. The man seems to have no quality screening mechanism.)In the next 20 minutes of screen time Danyael makes a miraculous recovery, chats up Val and gets her four months pregnant in 2 days. Now that's potency!Gabriel also decides to visit Tommy for assistance and without expanding Thomas Daggett plays no further part in this, nor the 4 other sequels!It turns out that Valerie's unborn child will be the key figure in the angelic war, having been born of woman and angel known as a nephalim. In short Gabriel and Co want to remove it from the picture by any means necessary, and Danyael and Co swear to protect it.Despite the mounting evidence;- the recovered car crash victim, - the 4 months in 2 days pregnancy, - dead bodies with no eyes and organs, - a warning from both the mortician who says this has happened before, get away!, - and a chat with Thomas Daggett's priest who says much the same ... Valerie is still skeptical, until Gabriel shows up and tries to rip the unborn child from her, somewhat against her will I would guess. And the rest of the film is basically a keep-e-off game between Gabriel and Danyael, with Valerie and her belly-bun as the ball.There is ample opportunity for this film to veer into Highlander cheesy territory, but the reason that it does not is basically the fact that everyone plays it straight... except Walken's Gabriel.Gabriel hams it up in every Prophecy film he appears in, which is actually a good thing folks. Gabriel openly detests humans, he can sniff and taste them, but can't drive or use a computer. As with the first film he takes a recently deceased re-animated assistant to complete such menial tasks, in this film it is actually Izzy, a recent suicide pact victim who just wants things to be the way they were when she was dead. (I guess she got her wish recently!) Gabriel treats her with disdain, bullies her and orders her around, playing the bad guy card beautifully.Without Christopher Walken there would have been no Prophecy 2, 3, 4, 5 or 6. I know he wasn't in the last couple, but this series would have died at 1 without his presence. (And I am not even a die-hard Walken fan like some.)This could have been Big guys in dark coats speaking formally while reading bible verses perched on a rooftop 2, but that probably didn't fit on the poster.Thankfully the filmmaker who took the reins from the original had sense to hold true to the tone, rely on the story rather than big stunts and hokey chase sequences, and kept things simple enough to not lose track. The music is similar to the original, which is a good thing, and they also use the effective (but annoying when a 3 year old is asleep in the next room ) technique of hushed dialogue and loud effects and action.I fully expected The Prophecy 2 to suck when I first watched it, and even recently when I dragged it out again I thought rewatching it would uncover hidden flaws and disappoint. It doesn't.Final Rating - 7.5 / 10. A case of second verse, much the same as the first, but a worthy sequel to a great film.

It had a more coherent story but thing with it story still was that it just wasn't very good. Not very good is perhaps not the best way to describe it. It's more that it's just very standards stuff all, like we have seen in literally dozens of movies before.So no The Prophecy II does not take any originality prizes but at least the movie was watchable, which is not something I can say about the first movie, from 3 years earlier. Seems like I'm one of the few people who doesn't like the fist movie The Prophecy, so it was sort of surprised with the fact that I sort of liked watching this sequel and thought that it was an improvement over the first movie.Even though its an incredibly standard movie there are still some elements in it that make it stand out. The biggest one is Christopher Walken. He really enjoys playing this role, which must be the reason why he also is in the first 3 movies out of the series. I mean, I don't think he got rich from playing in these cheap and straight-to-video movies. He is the foremost and perhaps only reason why the overall movie is still a fun one to watch. He plays his character with lots of passion and dark humor without ever going too over-the-top with it.There are some other well known actors in this movie as well, such as Russell Wong, Jennifer Beals, Brittany Murphy and Eric Roberts. Never quite understood why these movies always managed to have such a great cast with some big name actors in it.It certainly also helps that the movie isn't too long.

Their scenes together though good, are very brief, and don't occur until the last part of the movie. Before you get that far you have to sit through a lame rehash of the first film. The change of director and writer from the originals Gregory Widen is a major part of the problem. They have simplified the interesting concepts Widen developed and have the tendency to go for action over atmosphere. This is not a good thing. Walken reprises his role as the avenging angel Gabriel, but the script doesn't give him much to play with. The potentially fascinating character of Thomas Daggett (originally played by Elias Koteas) is here played by 'Re-Animator's Bruce Abbott, and is killed off within the first fifteen minutes. Bad idea! The main focus of the story then centres on the lovely Jennifer Beals who inadvertently gets involved in the war in heaven. Like the first movie the supporting cast is strong, and features Brittany Murphy ('Freeway', 'Clueless'), Tom Towles ('Henry Portrait Of A Serial Killer') and even punk legend Glenn Danzig. Unfortunately the cast of this movie is by far the most interesting thing about it. A major let down, this! Be sure to watch the original though, it's very good.

Christopher Walken is back as the sinister archangel Gabriel, a renegade determined to bring the existence of the human race to an end, so he goes after a pregnant woman for some reason or other. Yeah, none of this is particularly interesting, mired as it is in middle-of-the-road ordinary.One of the main reasons to watch this film is Walken himself; he brings a wry humour to his central role and he's quite a bit of fun to watch. The rest of the cast is populated by familiar faces who have little to work with. Jennifer Beals is still pretty years after FLASHDANCE although Russell Wong doesn't bring much substance to the part of protagonist. There are also minor roles for Bruce Abbott and Tom Towles as a cop. THE PROPHECY II is full of the usual religious mumbo-jumbo and random kill scenes and feels more than a little disjointed and insubstantial; it's watchable enough for fans of '90s-era movies but you don't bring much away from it.

Jennifer Beals plays a woman impregnated by an angel with the nephilim; a powerful angel with the free will of a human. How this war for heaven plays out on the earthly frontline doesn't bear serious consideration. It's quippy and fairly action packed for a direct to disc sequel. Christopher Walken as the disgruntled Gabriel steals the show with one-liners, a tongue in cheek performance and charisma to burn. Nothing about Prophecy II is functioning at his level. An average supernatural adventure followed by numerous sequels.

In the meantime, good angel Danyael (Wong) fulfills a prophecy told to him by head angel Michael (Eric Roberts). The ancient prophecy has an angel matting with a human making a half Angel/Human hybrid. The mortal Danyael chooses is a nurse named Valerie Rosales (Beals) who quickly realizes something is not right when her grandmother is found dead and she gets a visit from Gabriel. Danyael helps Valerie escape and spends the rest of the film trying to keep her safe and hidden. Gabriel has picked up another monkey named Izzy (Murphy) who is in pursuit of Valerie. All though unnecessary, this sequel is helped by a good cast with Walken stealing scenes like he did in the original and Beals as a spunky and believable heroine. Director Greg Spence Co-writing with Matt Greenberg takes the best things from the original and repeats them here, but this time injects some real scares and a nastier tone. This film's story doesn't break much new ground, so the tension Spence comes up with is very nice. The horror and gore is ramped up and the tone is actually scarier than the original. Part II is certainly entertaining, even though it isn't quite as thought provoking or original as the first installment.

Basically, Lucifer (this time played by Guri Weinberg) has decided that Hell isn't big enough for both him and Gabriel (Christopher Walken) and so he sends Gabriel back to earth to continue his war with the archangel Michael (Eric Roberts). Meanwhile, the detective Thomas Dagget (now played by Bruce Abbot) has returned to his previous calling and resides in a monastery where he continues to have visions. Anyway, our story starts off with an attractive registered nurse named Valerie Rosales (Jennifer Beals) driving to work and accidentally hitting a man who goes by the name of Danyael (Russell Wong). She takes him to the hospital where he recovers. One thing leads to another and within a very short time they spend the night together. What Valerie doesn't realize is that Danyael is an angel sent by Michael to get her pregnant. Naturally, Danyael succeeds. This causes a serious problem for Gabriel because the nephilim growing inside Valerie is prophesied to end the war in Heaven that Gabriel started. So once again Gabriel launches into a search-and-destroy routine. At any rate, Christopher Walken put on a splendid performance as did Jennifer Beals to a lesser degree. Be that as it may, I didn't care for Russell Wong's acting and I thought Eric Roberts wasn't utilized to his full potential. Likewise, the concept of relocating Eden from Mesopotamia to the United States and making it look like Scranton, Pennsylvania on a Monday night was also a bit weird. Additionally, this film is full of Scriptural inaccuracies and it seemed like the writers were simply making things up as they went along. Not only did they take the characters totally out-of-context but they ascribe motives to beings that are totally inconsistent with Biblical theology. For example, the archangel Michael would never look favorably upon the creation of a nephilim. Neither would Lucifer, for that matter, because the consequences would be incredibly disastrous for him as he knows only too well. And the writers should have known this before they built their entire story around something so preposterous. Again, there are many Biblical errors in this film that some people may not fully realize. Personally, I found the entire plot to be both sad and laughable and I have rated the film accordingly.

Either that, or maybe you're just a weird person who likes to watch sequels before seeing the original. Whatever waxes yer wings...In either case, if you are interested in dark, religious thrillers about angels doing nasty things, you MUST see the Prophecy trilogy. Yes, I know there are 5 Prophecy films, but we'll just focus on the first 3 for now.Much like Star Wars/Empire Strikes Back/Return of the Jedi, the first 3 Prophecy movies tell a continuing story about 1 character Gabriel, the Archangel of Death (played by Christopher Walken). Although the films' plots are mostly independent of each other, the theme of Gabriel's quest is a continuing story that doesn't wrap up til the end of the 3rd movie. Ergo you can't stop at Prophecy 1. You have to watch all 3.That's all you need to know, but if you want to know more about Prophecy II, here it is. By itself it's a worthwhile flick. What makes it special is the surreal blending of dark suspense and cozy humor, as in the first Prophecy. Although we lose some of the quirky characters who made the first film so memorable (such as Jerry the oozing sidekick, Rachel the catatonic chauffeur, and most of Joseph the stand-up comedic coroner), we get a new one who's just as memorable Brittany Murphy as Izzy the suicidal emo girl (long before the term 'emo' came into being).Walken and Murphy maintain the wacky humor that made the first Prophecy so characteristic & human. The other characters are there for action and furthering the plot, which is pretty straightforward as far as angels-fighting-a-war-on-earth movies go.The music isn't quite as lush as the first, although one of the themesongs (the airy tribal piece) is carried over. Most, if not all, of the movie takes place at night so it is both literally and figuratively dark. Not quite The Crow dark, but dark nonetheless.This movie has a distinct early-90s feel to it. The 90s was a decade of action films leaving behind the simple, clean stories of the 80s and embracing a darker realism (as in Seven and The Usual Suspects). I'd say this 2nd Prophecy film is closer to the 80s than its groundbreaking predecessor, but it's still a good film.Watch it for Walken, watch it for the continuing epic story, watch it for some engaging action and a few great gags.

So far, it has actually received four sequels - but this is the only one that I've seen. Overall, this film isn't good enough to warrant me bothering with any more follow-ups, but it provides a decent enough hour and twenty minutes of entertainment. Just like the original, this film fuses action with themes of biblical horror and once again follows the fortunes of the diabolical angel Gabriel during another plot to destroy the human race. Naturally, it's all very convoluted and silly; doesn't make much sense and features several elements that are obviously thrown in to sell the film; but hey, you can't expect anything else from a film like this. The film revolves around a child conceived by Gabriel's adversary, Danyael and a normal woman. Gabriel has taken it upon himself to get rid of this baby, which was prophesised by a monk; and after his army of angels have been exterminated, he decides to employ the services of a suicidal girl named 'Izzy'...The main reason I saw this film was, of course, because of the presence of its lead star; Christopher Walken. Walken's role isn't very meaty, but he makes the best of it with a charged performance that steals every scene he's in. The original film benefited from a great star-studded cast to support Walken; whereas this film doesn't. That being said, it does feature some decent actors. Jennifer Beals is good in support along with Russell Wong, while future star Brittany Murphy stands out as the suicide obsessed teen and cult horror fans will recognise Re-Animator's Bruce Abbott in a small role. The film features a plethora of action scenes, which are mostly well done; but after a while it all gets rather dry as the plot isn't too interesting and it all seems to drone on. The film doesn't really fit much with any actual bible stories; which is something of a disappointment as that was one of the best things about the original movie. Overall, Prophecy II is worth seeing for fans of the original, although it's not a particularly good movie. "},{"Title":"Worthy sequel to the original","Date":"10 January 2005","Score":"","Genre":"Fantasy, Horror, Thriller","Review":" The Prophecy 2 is a worthwhile entry in the series.**SPOILERS**While driving to work, Nurse Valerie, (Jennifer Beals) accidentally hits a man, Danyael, (Russell Wong) who fell out of the sky. She takes him back to her home. At the same time, fallen angel Gabriel (Christopher Walken) escapes from hell and stalks around LA looking to get back into heaven, killing rival angel Rafael (Glenn Danzig). Danyael escapes and disappears into the LA underworld. Gabriel finds out about Danyael and Valerie and starts to stalk her. Valerie discovers that she is already pregnant with Danyael's child, and starts to go looking for him. Gabriel thinks that the best way to track down Valerie is with a human disciple, and recruits Izzy (Brittany Murphy) to help him. Digging dipper into Danyael's disappearance, she learns that she has stumbled onto an ages old war between the rival factions of God's angels. The child she is pregnant with is to be the person who unites the two warring factions of Heaven. Danyael is able to save her from an attack from Gabriel. Together they go in search of the one person who can fulfill Valerie's fate, Michael (Eric Roberts). Gabriel has also tracked them to Michael's location, and begins to tear it apart looking for Valerie to stop her from delivering the child and ending the war of the angels.The Good News I really enjoy this movie, and I think it is nearly as good as its predecessor. The main improvement over the first one is the heightened gore in the film. There is far more heart ripping in this one than in the first one, which allows for more bloodletting in the time of death than in the other one. We also get to see more gore in the attacks on the two angels in the film. As both are perceived, unknowingly, as a threat to humanity, there are several fine shoot-outs with the police and the two angels. Even Izzy has a few cool gore scenes when she is learning that Gabriel has made her immortal to aid in his search. Being rammed into a wall, impaled by steel rods and even shot several times are all bloody revealed. It was nice to see that after a near-bloodless part 1. Even though it was a little shorter, it never really felt short at all. It always held your attention for the duration, and it keeps enough action coming to entertain anyone.The Bad News Anyone who has even a small amount of religious doctrine will be able to smell the baloney in this movie. It is really so obvious how preposterous this movie is that it almost makes no sense why this is made. A lot of it could be construed as religious at some point, but it does take a lot of construing to believe most of the story. The plot is interesting enough, but a lot of the back-story involved is the main problem.The Final Verdict If you don't have too much of a problem with a lot of religious banter in a movie, this one isn't all that bad. It does have enough to offset the religious parts of the movie, and at least give the film a rental. Gorehounds will be the most pleased with this film.Rated R Graphic Violence, a strong sex scene, and Brief Nudity "},{"Title":"Shouldn't have been made.","Date":"29 August 2001","Score":"","Genre":"Fantasy, Horror, Thriller","Review":"  I liked the first movie, but this is a textbook example of a sequel that would have been better of left on the drawing board.

This part is the darkest of the three and has more angels in it than you can shake a stick at. There's a lot of nifty fights, heart ripping and cool looking customers - though I found the 'ethereal' look of the angels under par for the series.In 'The Prophecy' Stoltz, Walken and Mortensen had something unearthly about them that made you almost believe they could be supernatural beings. This time most of the angels look like thugs or -in the case of Danyael- like a Haynes underwear model. I found Roberts to be a particularly bad choice for Michael...oh well.The music is great. They kept the score from the original which was a good idea. The choir music gives the characters that 'divine' aura and serenity, while the driving beat underneath lets you know that things are happening - fast. There is also more humor in this one than in the last.Not a movie I'd recommend seeing as a stand alone, but as part of the series. Enjoy.The only problem I had was at the beginning. It is never really explained why Gabriel comes back (and how he manages it), but without Walken this movie wouldn't work.7/10 "}{"Title":"An object lesson in how good movies make bad sequels..","Date":"9 September 1999","Score":"3 out of 6 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Fantasy, Horror, Thriller","Review":"  It's not often I feel compelled to give negative criticism of a film; after all I often feel the maxim, if you don't have anything good to say don't say it at all, would be apt advice for the many naysayers we listen to everyday who nitpick at things we like.  If it's all the same to you the reader though I feel compelled to point out that with the lone exception of Christopher Walken in a returning role as Gabriel this movie is pathetically HORRID.  I say this to you to warn you in advance that even if you are a fan of Walken's deadpan delivery and style or liked the original Prophecy that you will be sorely dissapointed.  If you buy it, return it.  If you rent it, make sure it's only ninety-nine cents.What's wrong with this movie?  A full list would take too long to read and would bore you to tears, but a short summary would be the following the once rather crystalline clear picture of the relationship between angels and mortals of the first film is ripped to shreds.  Gabriel is turned from the rather morbid right hand of God he once was (and in this role he is WICKEDLY funny in the first) to little more than a thug for heaven.  Since Walken is so good at playing heavies (we all remember Frank White from King of New York) he is still enjoyable but the supporting cast is an unmitigated and unconvincing mess of mortals and angels alike who couldn't buy a clue for 50 cents.  If you can figure out the plot you're a smarter man than I.  One gets the feeling we wander aimlessly from scene to scene just to move the film along to Walken's next big line.  By the end of the movie you're actually wishing he'd blow his horn and make the walls of Jericho fall on the people who made this un-natural disaster.Bottom line - it's an insult to our intelligence that they made a sequel to this film in the first place.  The original told the right story, answered the questions that should have been, and left alone the ones you were meant to ponder afterwards.  There are no compelling reasons to follow these characters that was in the first - the priest who lost his faith, the little girl who kept the big secret, the teacher who protected her children - even Lucifer himself was more interesting BY himself in the first film than all the other characters in the sequel put together.  I feel sorry for anybody who sees this film and not the first because they'll probably never want to watch the original and that's a real tragedy.

I was a little disappointed they could not get Elias Koteas back to reprise his role as Dagget, brief as that part is, but was pleasantly surprised to see Steve Hytner back in the role of Joseph, the coroner. Walken, of course, is consistent as the stars as Gabriel, and brings back a near corpse in the form of Brittany Murphy, who does a much better job in this film that others I have seen her in (In my opinion, the epitome of her career was in Uptown Girls, where she was totally upstaged by Dakota Fanning). Russell Wong is strong in his portrayal of Danyael, with the perfect balance of passion and aloofness. He cares for the human female, but realizes she is mortal, while the Nepahlim they create will not be. Jennifer Beals could have been a bit more passionate in the role, but her performance is passable and doesn't detract from the film's overall theme. Finally Eric Roberts does what he does best, let's his personality shine through, which is to say dispassionate, cold, and ambiguous. But that works here, and since the role is brief, does not detract from the plot or the action. Rated R for sexual situations, language, and graphic violence, this film is a worthy companion to the first, and if you own The Prophecy, this will make a nice addition. But as with all sequels, its a toss up. Definitely worth a viewing, but I suggest you rent it first before you buy a copy.

Part two is a very prototypic example of a straight-to-video sequel, meaning the creative and convoluted plot of the original has been simplified a lot in favor of more action, more witty one-liners and a lot more eerie religious scenery. The only good news is that the producers managed to keep Christopher Walken for the role of Gabriel, and he delivers another gloriously brazen performance that promptly justifies the price of a rental. If it wasn't for Walken's performance (and perhaps a couple of players in the supportive cast like Brittany Murphy and Glenn Danzig), The Prophecy II surely would have disappeared into oblivion straight after its release. The movie begins with Gabriel literally getting spat out of hell to proceed with his ongoing War of Heaven here on earth. The purpose of his battle this time is to prevent the baby of nurse Valerie Rosales (Jennifer Beals) from getting born. For you see, her unborn child is the first ever hybrid between a heavenly angel and an earthly monkey and the birth of such a superior being would imply the downfall of Gabriel's evil dominion. Thus, just as in the first movie, he engages a suicidal accomplice to assist him and hunts Valerie all the way down to the Eden for the final showdown. The Prophecy II is an endurable and occasionally even entertaining movie as long as you don't make comparisons with the original and as long as you manage to overlook the multiple plot holes and errors in continuity. Whenever the storyline becomes too tedious, the makers luckily enough always insert a near-brilliant Christopher Walken moment to distract you. His interactions with the rebellious Izzy and particularly his ignorance regarding modern earthly technologies often result in worthwhile and memorable sequences. On a slightly off-topic note, I often felt like The Prophecy II ambitions to look similar to Terminator II &#133; Gabriel's resurrection looked somewhat like the teleportation of a futuristic cyborg and the Eden location, where the final battle takes place, looks very similar to the steel factory where Terminator II ended as well. Coincidence, I guess? Overall, this is an inferior and passable sequel but still worth checking out in case you're a fan of Christopher Walken's unique acting charisma (and who isn't?).

Little characteristics such as these made the movie that much more pleasant for me.  Usually, doing research on a movie after the fact and finding out that characters are made up are usually a let down.  This is not the case, which kind of adds a realistic quality to it.What made Prophesy II so much more interesting is that the writers introduced the other arch-angels, and a surprising Michael played by Eric Roberts.  The other angels depicted in the movie do exist according to references on angels, and the fact that the writers took this much time to make it accurate was so pleasing.The movie is essentially well-cast, the plot and movie much darker than the original, but overall quite a show.

Valerie must stay alive long enough to raise her child or both heaven & Earth will be destroyed, now that's pressure...Co-written & directed by Greg Spence I thought The Prophecy II was a decent time waster but nothing particularly special. The script by Spence & associate producer Matt Greenberg is fairly exposition heavy & has some interesting ideas but it's a bit slow even at less than 90 minutes & is sometimes a little hard to follow. I admit that I have never seen the original The Prophecy (1995) & as such I didn't have a clue what was going on for the first half of this film, this is a sequel where it is advisable that you have seen the original because if your anything like me you'll spend the first half wondering who everyone is what the hell's going on, I mean there's an early scene where some guy in a long coat touches the ground of some parking lot & then cracks in the ground open & Christopher Walken's character emerges & I sat there & thought to myself 'what just happened there & who was that guy?' neither of which are satisfactorily explained. There are various religious ideas & themes with horror & supernatural overtones & elements here as one would expect in a film about angels & while they are OK they never really engage or interest that much & are fairly forgettable. I liked the notion that an angel didn't know how to drive or what a computer is with Christopher Walken not even knowing how to use a gun. If you like religious themed horror them you'll almost certainly like The Prophecy II but if you don't then, like me, it may not do too much for you.Director Spence does a good job & the film has a great sense of style, there's some nice colour schemes going on as well. There are a few eerie moments but I wouldn't say it's particularly scary, it does have a nice atmosphere though. There's not much gore on show, there are a couple of ripped out hearts, a few impalings & a messed up body on an autopsy table. Some of it's a bit silly, I mean I don't know how Valerie survives falling off the top of that building, Gabriel's body wouldn't have been enough to break the fall & even if it was why wasn't she impaled on the spike along with him? By the way if your interested the IMDb has spelt Danyael's name wrong in their 'Plot Outline' on the main page...Going straight-to-video this probably had a decent budget & it show's, it's well made & pretty stylish with it. The special effects are good & the acting is alright with Christopher Walken stealing every scene he's in, the guy is just a great actor.The Prophecy II is an alright religious themed supernatural horror thriller, it's worth a watch but it's nothing special. This was enough of a success to spawn three further sequels, The prophecy 3 The Ascent (2000), The Prophecy Uprising (2005) & The Prophecy Forsaken (2005).

The acting, the special effects, the violence, all contrived and utterly unbelievable.  The makeup was atrocious, and the script was hellacious.  I love Christopher Walken, but he was really miscast in this role; he is far too matter-of-fact to play such a malevolent entity. Dreck! "},{"Title":"Christopher Walken kicks ass","Date":"31 March 2005","Score":"0 out of 3 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Fantasy, Horror, Thriller","Review":" Yeah, this film was pretty cool.Like the first one, I didn't understand most of it, but Christopher Walken's performance - on par with that from the first Prophecy - was just effortlessly fantastic! Gabriel acts the same as he did in the first, and what we got here (is a little game of show and tell..) is the same guy with a little more violence and some more funny lines. Gabriel owns any scene he's in, he's the villain we all root for and he's still scary as hell. That's the stuff Chris! The Prophecy II takes the same structure as the first, and it takes a good while before we see much of Gabriel at all - but when we do, the film comes alive. Our beloved angel takes quite a beating this time, such as a stabbing through the chest, being destroyed by police bullets, falling from a skyscraper building and being whacked in the face with an axe.Russel Wong is the other title star - he's pretty cool but a bit boring. Jennifer Beals is okay, as is Eric Roberts as Michael. But Brittany Murphy as the suicidal teenager Izzy is cool, a teenage girl sick of living who just wants to join her lover in the sky. How sweet...It's got great effects and a high budget for a straight to video flick... it's weird that with Walken as its star it didn't get a cinema release! But whatever...Rent it if you liked the first, it's cool. "}]
