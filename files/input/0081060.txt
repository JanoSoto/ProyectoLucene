The wrong way - the Ferris Whitney way - is to romanticize it like Romeo and Juliette. The other wrong way -- Angel's way and the way I saw it at the time -- is to see it as something scary, invasive, animalistic, and biological which is approaching to seize you, engulf you, and reprogram you into a mindless reproduction-machine.Of the eight characters, only Angel discovers the truth God, it was so... PERSONAL, like you could see right through me. Sex turns out not to be storybook romance OR a tyrannical usurping of your body by the Forces of Evolution, but something very, very, very, very real, immediate... and YOU.In the boathouse, Angel discovers that sex is not something scary she is forced to be, but something wonderful she was always meant to be.In the words of the novel, All the fear and uncertainty melted away as they kissed. Soon she didn't know who was touching whom, only that it was wonderful, and right, and fine. And the moon stared impenetrably through the window.Notice how before, she's withdrawn, sarcastic, and hostile; and after, she's relaxed and kind of at one with the world, like she's a part of it, instead of a stranger in it.In the very last scene, she hugs her mom -- something she NEVER would have done before -- saying What's this crap about sex being nothing? You've been hanging around creeps! This resonated very, very strongly with me at that age; I wanted that to happen to ME. And I don't mean getting laid.The movie was supposedly filmed in Madison, Georgia,at Hard Labor Creek state park. I was wondering if any evidence that a movie had been made would even still exist after two years. The first thing I came upon was a big sign over the road Camp Little Wolf. My God! All the sets and props were intact... and abandoned.Alone, I explored. I walked on the dock and sat on the swing. When night came, I slept in Cabin A, in the bed that Angel did. The next day, I jumped into the lake, hoping that this baptism would somehow cause the same ...transformation which happened to her the transformation from child to adult.And finally, before leaving, I sat for hours in the boathouse, on the spot where it happened, just thinking.Did I like the film, Little Darlings? Yeah.Yeah, I did.

At the time, I thought I would see the movie once and forget about it. I have seen the movie many, many times and I have never forgotten it. The late Gene Siskel said in his TV review of the movie that it was really two movies, a broad Animal House type comedy with food fights and condom jokes (which it is) and a very good coming of age story (which it is). When Matt Dillon was recently on the Bravo series Inside the Actor's Studio, Dillon heard so many students say they liked this film, he actually said they ought to do a sequel. I hope they don't. I think he was really surprised to hear people praise this movie twenty years later. Some films stay with you and this is one of them.

The story is a familiar one, two girls from opposite side of the tracks are involved in a bet while at summer camp and they wager who loses their virginity first. Kristy McNichol is Angel, a girl raised by her mother in a bad neighborhood who is very tough. You can tell she's tough because she chews gum and when she smokes she blows smoke in your face! Tatum O'Neal is Ferris, a rich girl who's father is divorcing her mother. At the camp the other girls all say they have lost their virginity but Ferris and Angel admit they have not. The girls get their money together and make them agree to the bet. Ferris has eyes on an older camp counselor named Gary (Armand Assante) while Angel meets Randy (Matt Dillon) one of the boys from the boys camp across the lake. The film starts out with the usual bitchy banter from the girls and of course there's a food fight in the dining area. The film is not well made but the acting by McNichol is just top notch. Film has that low budget look about it and its not shot with any creative camera angles. But one thing that the film does well is keep the camera on McNichols face, when you think that the shot is going to change angles it does not. The camera lingers on her and it allows McNichol to vary her expressions during some scenes that require a lot from her. Film also does a good job of having this familiar material be from the perspective of a young girl instead of a young man. This is not a great film, most of the characters are badly written and just cardboard characters but when its time for McNichol to lose her virginity then the film becomes a compelling study of a young girl trying to cope with her first time. Its a very mature performance and one that most actress's of her age would not have handled this impressively. McNichol could vary her emotions at the drop of a hat, one moment she has tears in her eyes and in the next instant she gives you that smile that changes the complexities of the whole scene. You can make a case that its one of the best performances of the 80's. She's that terrific! Its also fun to watch a young Krista Errickson (The First Time) and a very young Cynthia Nixon (Sex in the City). I'm at odds with myself, I don't think its a great film but its one that I just can't stop thinking about. Not hard to figure out why. Thanks Kristy!  "},{"Title":"Excellent Movie!

Although I nearly died of embarrassment years later when I asked my father quite innocently what were those balloon things that the girls stole from the restroom.This movie is campy (no pun intended) this movie is 80's-style cheesy, but none of these factors change the fact that this is a GOOD movie. It details the exploits of a group of teenage girls at summer camp more accurately than any other summer camp movie I've seen. The acting isn't sterling at all times, but it doesn't change the fact that you feel as if you really are watching a bunch of girls goofing off and having fun at summer camp. The food fight scene is wonderfully real with the actors all genuinely laughing and having a great time, the condom-thieving scene is legendary and never loses its hilarity. All the fun and silliness is balanced with the seriousness of some of the situations they get themselves into, and there is a wonderful sense of shared growth between the characters. As stated by many other reviewers, Kristy McNichol shines in her role as Angel, and pulls off a startlingly emotional performance opposite a young Matt Dillon.I recommend this movie to every preteen girl, even though it is a tad outdated, I think the heart of the movie will still ring true to all girls out there.

Tatum O'Neal has the flashy name on the poster, and seems to be the ideal person to take a crap on, but I think she fulfilled the requirements of the role of pampered princess, with eyes for handsome Armande Asante, one the camp counselors. Matt Dillon is a prick as always, annoyed at Angel's reservations towards putting out, considering himself quite the lothario. I think the intention with him was to show that it's all external toughness, for show, while he's actually a vulnerable kid on the inside. Whatever your sentiments, I found him to be a rude jerk, with a rather crude personality. Anyway, McNichol has these two excellent scenes, so authentic and real, her feelings after having sex, losing her virginity, and finding that this supposedly grand event wasn't so precious or special, and the superb admission where she informs Ferris(O'Neal)that she actually did forfeit her innocence to Randy(Dillon). There's so much presented to us, the conflicts and inner turmoil, in how McNichol handles Randy's frustrations in her teasing him before eventually succumbing to the pressure, that I had to applaud such work from a young actress who seemed to channel the exact feelings many teenage girls face when going through the hormonal stage of adolescence into adulthood. There are summer camp clichés apparent, such as a food fight, infighting between girls, and sex talk. If it's true that O'Neal had her pick of role to play, I'm tickled pink she chose Ferris and McNichol got the part of Angel..Ferris is more surface stereotype while Angel has various levels to her that evolve over course of the film.

Maxwell's Little Darlings beat American Pie to the punch back in 1980 with this mildly entertaining but ultimately coy 90-minute comedy about the rivalry between two 15-year old girls at summer camp that to see who could be the first to lose their virginity. Of course, the PG-rated Little Darlings has nothing in the way of nudity or raunch to compare with American Pie. Tatum O'Neal of Paper Moon fame plays Ferris, a rich but introverted girl from a broken home, while Kristy McNichol of The Pirate Movie is Angel, the street-wise, chain-smoking Marlboro tomboy from the wrong side of the tracks. The minute that Ferris and Angel meet, it's hate at first sight. They fight on the bus in route to Camp Little Wolf, and they seem destined to battle each other the rest of the summer. One of the girls Cinder (Krista Errickson of Jailbait) suggests a way for the two girls to work off their rage more creatively.The screenplay by Kimi Peck and Dalene (The Baby Sitters Club) Young is provocative but harmless. Immoralities abound. Angel hot-wires a school bus and takes a group of girls gets on a joy ride, but there is more talk than action. Slow moving as it is, Little Darlings is a curious film. It is rated R; presumably, the rating is for the implied sex. Parents will be relieved that Little Darlings discourages pre-martial sexual intercourse. In the words of one character, Kissing is more fun. Ferris sets her sights on an older man for her first conquest, Gary Callahan (Armand Assante of American Gangster), who teaches high school French and serves as the camp counselor, while Angel pursues Randy (Matt Dillon of Drugstore Cowboy) when she fuels up the bus at a gas station. Meanwhile, Ferris plays like she is drowning to get Mr. Callahan to come after her. The film promises more than it delivers, and the characters are too sketchy to be believed.If you're a parent, Little Darlings depicts what questions and ideas are turning over in a young girl's mind. There is nothing here to corrupt anyone except the 'idea' which comes along at that age anyway. Teenage girls will probably appreciate the shop-talk dialogue. The trailer where McNichol kicks a dude in the family jewels is one of the more memorable scenes along with the condom stealing scene. Look for Sex in the City's Cynthia Nixon in her first role.

The film is a story about two fifteen year old girls who are under the impression that they are the only virgins in their cabin at summer camp. One of them (Kristy McNichol) is a street-smart girl from the wrong side of town. She is quick to pick a fight, and chain smokes like someone of a much more advanced age. The other girl (Tatum O'Neal) is a spoiled little rich girl from a dysfunctional family. Has there ever been a non-dysfunctional rich family in a movie? The two girls make a bet to see who can score with a boy before summer's end. Virtually all the girls in the camp have some $ down on one or the other. O'Neal tries for a handsome and sophisticated camp counselor, while McNichol sets her sights on Matt Dillon. After the first hour, the film stops trying to be silly, and it evolves into a poignant study about the consequences of such a bet. The result is one terrific little film.This film, despite being labeled by many as a comedy, handles the subject matter in a mature and thoughtful fashion. It's kind of sad when the girls finally realize how their bet has affected not only themselves, but the men involved in it. Matt Dillon is noticeably angry when he finds out he was used, and the older counselor (Armand Assante) is in danger of his life being ruined by association. Even though nothing happens between him and O'Neal.One would hope that contests like the one in this film do not happen much in real life. At least not with young ladies. Us guys are the ones you would expect this type of thing from in our attempts to lose our virginity. Notice how the subject can be treated as a full blown comedy in films like American Pie when guys are the central characters. Young women would be better served if they waited for the right guy and made him at least earn it a little more.This would be a good film for parents to show their daughters before sending them off to junior high school. It would be a good learning tool for them to see how important this type of decision can be.Don't miss this film!

Kristy McNichol is wonderful trying to talk her way through a lovers' night with Matt Dillon, or when they finally warm to each other and she says, Don't laugh...but do you care about me a little?

I tend to mostly agree with that sentiment, though I find it a bit unfair. While certainly no classic, 'Little Darlings' does have its moments as well as two fine performances by Tatum O'Neal and Kristy McNichol. The young actresses had already established themselves as up-and-comers, O'Neal by being the youngest actress to win an Oscar (for 'Paper Moon') while McNichol had garnered favorable notices for her tomboy-ish role in the TV series, 'Family.' In 'Little Darlings,' O'Neal plays Ferris, a precocious teen girl of privilege and McNichol plays, well, a tomboy named Angel with a lot of street smarts who is more sensitive than she lets on. So neither actress is really playing against type here. They do show their acting chops though and they're both better than the material. They go to a girls' summer camp and find themselves in the center of a contest to see which of them can lose her virginity first. The other girls at the camp split into competing teams and place bets. This is where a lot of confusion about the film comes from; it was marketed as sort of a female version of 'Porky's' and this is a wholly inaccurate portrayal of the movie. Much of it could be lifted straight from a Disney flick; there's a predictably lame food fight and an 'oh gosh, aren't we wild' hijacking of a school bus. 'Little Darlings' can't decide if it wants to be a G-rated kids flick or a serious drama about growing up. But it certainly has nothing in common with 'Porky's.' Angel sets her sights on a suitable prospect (Matt Dillon) at the boy's camp across the lake; she seems less worried about having sex, since her floozy mother has described it as no big deal. Ferris is a bit more ambitious. She targets a camp counselor, Gary (Armand Assante), a grown man no less, and envisions them having a romantic candle-lit dinner before whatever happens when you have sex takes place. In the end, Angel does have an intimate encounter of sorts with 'Randy' (good name) but it turns out to be disappointing and disturbing to her, more so than she envisioned. Ferris, on the other hand, blithely concocts in her mind a night of passion with Gary as she imagines it might be, which she describes in such rapturous terms to the other girls that they all believe she did, in fact, go to bed with him. The moral, no doubt, is that for a 16-year-old girl, fantasizing about sex is much better than actually having it. Or at least it was in this case. Some of the scenes toward the end are so well written and performed, it seems a shame they have to share screen time with the goofy nonsense in the middle. 'Little Darlings' wants to be more than it is, but only occasionally gets it right. It's also a shame that both Tatum O'Neal and Kristy McNichol were unable, for various reasons, to capitalize on their early successes and continue with interesting and successful roles. They showed a lot of promise, and 'Little Darlings' is worth seeing for their performances alone.

I like what it's setting up to do. The problem starts with the males. Assante is way too old and a bit awkward. Dillon is hunky hot with super fine hair. However he's a bit too empty. I like the girls' drama together but their time with the guys aren't that compelling. McNichol acts her little heart out bringing on the waterworks. It's not a broad teen comedy but it doesn't rise to be an intense coming-of-age story either. The girls are good but this could be better.

For those who want to know why Little Darlings not been released on DVD, there for two reasons. 1 It's because it is a Paramount Picture and Paramount has basically given up their DVD rights to films they made post 1949 to Warner Home Video ( the earlier talking films are all owned by Universal) except for what they call  Legacy Films such as The Godfather and Star Trek. 2 It is an extremely dated film ( what we know about Kristy McNiichol (Angel) and Tatum O''Neill Ferris) is very much opposite the characters they play in this movie). What it is about is two very different teenage girls ( although both are very tough ( watch Feris on the bus with Angel and you will see what I mean), Angel is the one with the poor chain smoking mother from the wrong side of the tracks, and Ferris, with the wealthy dad, whose mom abandoned both of them. The two of them cannot stand each other, and there is a bet to see who loses their virginity first Angel with a boy named Randy ( Matt Damon), or Ferris to a camp worker named Gary ( Armand Assante). There are also several other girls involved with the bet ( including Sunshine ( a very young Cynthia Nixon) and very nasty Cinder ( Krista Errickson ( a dead on look alike for Brooke Shields)). Each girl claimed that they had sex ( of course, only Cinder did). Spoilers ahead Ferris says she did, but she is lying ( which no one really knows but Angel who really did). The movie ends with Sunshine punching Cinder in the nose, and she is angry because it could cost her modeling career. Then Angel says to her mom,  You are not getting any younger and I have to take care of you. Then she introduces her to  Ferris Whitney best friend.  and she puts her arm around her as the movie ends and they play The Bellamy a Brothers Let Your Love Flow. It is not spelled out but it is highly inferred, that Amanda and her mom will be going home with Mr. Whitney ( because he is really lost without his wife, and needs someone to help with Ferris), and Angel and Ferris have become like sisters, so they cannot be separated. will not enjoy the movie as much as I did when I was a kid, because of what I have learned about both Tatum and Kristy , but based on what I remember and I remember it very well, it gets 9 of10 stars "}{"Title":"A Sex-Comedy for Girls?","Date":"11 July 2011","Score":"2 out of 4 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Drama","Review":" I don't know how I missed this coming-of-age comedy in my youth, but somehow I'd never heard of it 'til I caught it while channel-surfing one day.

I guess I should have expected it, but the preachy style was a letdown. In the end, the film maintained the double-standard. Sex is a big deal for women -- don't do it unless you're in love, yadda yadda. Funny how I don't recall these sorts of messages in the male-oriented sex comedies. But it WAS 1980 so I guess I shouldn't be too surprised. Perhaps a remake is in order? All in all, I still enjoyed it. Nice performances all around; particularly Kristy McNichol as Angel.

It pretends to be risqué -- two teen girls at summer camp competing to see who can lose their virginity first. But ultimately, it's just another Hollywood morality tale, which pretends to be honest because a few of the teens cuss, smoke, drink, and have sex but ends with a cheesy, predictable, conventional message -- that first casual sexual experience will leave a girl miserable -- that could just as well have been delivered by the pope.So I'd say late-night TV viewing material at best, not something that I'd want to buy. Too bad, because with a bit of Animal House subversiveness and abandon this movie could have been in-your-face and hysterical. The elements are there, but it's clear that the filmmakers (or, I suspect, the suits at the studio) didn't have the guts to transcend the conventions of the teen exploitation flick. For contemporaneous movies that portrays teens as they really are, see Over the Edge or The Outsiders. Both succeed because they're frank rather than scared.

With all the sex talk, smoking, drinking, swearing...not to mention the theme around which this movie revolves...it would be one of the last movies I'd recommend. As for its 'wonderful, sensitive' treatment of the theme, I think not.The story revolves around two 15 year olds at a summer camp...Ferris (Tatum O'Neil), a spoiled, rich girl, and Angel (Kristy McNichol), a tough, street smart kid from the wrong side of the tracks. Near the beginning of camp, the two make a wager as to who will lose her virginity first. Wonderful premise to start here, just what everyone would want for their own or their daughter's first experience, although the point is well made, I suppose, that the bet was an absolutely foolhardy idea in the first place. Anyway, one would hardly expect this wager to provide much of a challenge. Neither one of these pretty girls should have a very difficult time finding a guy who'll oblige and help her win... Anyway, their mission determined, Ferris sets her sights on an older camp counselor, Gary (Armand Assante) who shouldn't be messing around with 15 year old girls in the first place (just an aside), while Angel goes for a boy, Randy (Matt Dillon) from the camp across the lake. In short, Ferris claims she had sex but didn't, and Angel vows she didn't have sex but did. I suppose it at least makes the point that sex isn't something you should brag about, and that people lie about their sexual experiences all the time to impress. It also teaches a lesson in the unacceptability of using people, as Randy isn't very impressed to discover that Angel had sex with him because of the bet. Even guys can be used, folks.In terms of the stars, Tatum's performance isn't very impressive, nor her character particularly interesting, though the events at least undo Ferris's previous unrealistic, fantasy-like Romeo and Juliet sexual expectations. Kristy does, I must admit, give an amazing and brilliant performance for her age, showing all the conflicted roller-coaster of emotions that losing her virginity brings. However, I question whether Angel's first sexual encounter suddenly turns her into this supposedly warm, caring young woman that will now for the first time hug her mother. The point SHOULD have been that she hugs her mom because she's just so wretchedly upset over the whole sorry business, regrets her behavior, and wants comfort...a not unlikely scenario, in my opinion, and the correct message here. Not this whole phony 'awakening sexuality' hoopla, and imparting that just because the guy was nice, the sex was great and quite acceptable. The movie depicts teenagers playing with fire, as far as I'm concerned, in terms of the bet, the subsequent events, and the overall message of the movie, which totally divorces sex from meaningful love...much less true commitment and marriage, heaven forbid. Angel may indeed have had feelings for Randy (and even vice versa), but teenage summer camp romances are not noted for their longevity. Plus, let's remember, these girls are all of 15. The film does at least convey some of the intense feelings normally involved in a first sexual experience, that sex is neither all romantic Romeo and Juliet nor merely biology, but it doesn't relate loss of virginity in any way to genuine love. A great performance here by Kristy McNichol and a few good points made as mentioned, but a very damaging message overall. Maybe they should have continued on with the plot, having Angel realize a few weeks later that the condom failed and she's forced at age 15 to cope with either an unwanted pregnancy & childbirth (and either childrearing or adoption), or else the devastating dilemma of abortion. So much for her beautiful sexual awakening. This film is neither cute, amusing, nor nostalgic. Keep it out of the classroom, please. "}]
