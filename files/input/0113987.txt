[{"Title":"A Sympathetic View of a Hated Man","Date":"17 April 2004","Score":"82 out of 95 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Biography, Drama, History","Review":"  Everyone accuses Oliver Stone of being a conspiracy theorist, a revisionist historian, a muckraker, and a falsifier of history. Whether these things are true or not, he is a great director and his portrait of president Richard Nixon is sensitive, fair, and human. Stone may be opposed to Nixon, but he does not depict him as a monster. Stone and Hopkins give us Nixon, the man undone by fear. He is not condemned, nor is he forgiven. In spite of some scenes suggesting a connection with conspirators involved in the assassination of JFK, the president is given a fair shake.Hopkins gives a wonderful performance as Nixon. He's not a carbon copy, but he gets the voice and mannerisms down so well that it doesn't matter. At his side he has Joan Allen as Pat and Paul Sorvino as a picture perfect Henry Kissinger. The supporting cast features James Woods, Bob Hoskins, Ed Harris, and E.G. Marshall and, for their part, they shine as well. Call Stone over the top all you want, but he gets real performances.The biopic structure of Nixon starts us off with his political career in the late 50s. The audience gets a taste of the man's relationship with his wife and (mostly through flashbacks) his relationship with his mother. The flashback structure and editing scheme aren't as impressive as those used by Stone in JFK, but they serve the movie well and make the 3 hours run by smoothly. As the story rolls on you get a real sense of sympathy for Nixon. I was pretty surprised how much pathos Stone could build for a character history labels a monster. Throughout the Watergate scandal we are not outraged at Nixon, we fear for him, his paranoia is ours. Nixon is a human being just like us and we can understand his mistakes and his flaws and his fears. By the end it's hard to think of him as the monster you thought of before.Robert Richardson's stunning photography helps to perfectly render this drama. Nixon is a sensational looking movie. Just like Stone did with JFK and Natural Born Killers, the photography and editing work to heighten the drama and never distract from it. The approach as human rather than historical drama makes Nixon believable and touching. Who'd have thought I'd ever shed tears over Richard Nixon! Anthony Hopkins does the trick.I would recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys good drama. Fans of the cast and of Oliver Stone won't be disappointed.

The reason I usually don't like him is that, though he is a great technical director and visual stylist, his scripts are heavy-handed and one-sided to the point of absurdity. But not here. In fact, the script is perhaps the most impressive element in this whole movie, not only for how ambiguous and even-handed it is in dealing with Nixon as a character, but also for the brilliant way it moves around in time. It starts with Nixon, feeling embattled in the White House in 1973 as the Watergate hearings are upon him, and uses the device of him listening to his secret tapes to jump back and forth to previous eras, flawlessly moving between past and present to give an impressionistic, kaleidoscopic overview of the man's life, instead of following the staid and ho-hum linear approach most movie biographies take (most recent example Man on the Moon, the bio on Andy Kaufman which was a snoozer in spite of a great performance by Jim Carrey mainly because of the dry boring, This happened. . .And then this happened approach).Another reason to see this film is the brilliant, absolutely overwhelming lead performance by Anthony Hopkins; his Nixon may not look or sound exactly like the 37th president (but come on, except maybe for Ed Sullivan, who does?) but he embodies his qualities - strengths as well as weaknesses - to such an enormous degree that he simply BECOMES Nixon, at least for the three hours the movie is on screen.I have to say, though, I was not nearly as impressed as every one else (critics and general audiences alike) seems to be about Joan Allen as Pat Nixon. It's nothing against her performance, she did fine, it's just that as written, the part is rather weak. In fact, I was much more bothered about the liberties the filmmakers took in fleshing out her character than in all the political events; it's like, whenever they wanted to have someone blast Nixon or act as his conscience, they'd trot out Ol' Pat, giving her some of the most embarrasingly speechified moments in all of the movies - almost none of their scenes together ringed true as husband as wife; it was more like Nixon sitting across from the Filmmakers' Conscience. In fact, she's angry at him so often in the film you have to wonder, what exactly does she love about the man? The film never answers (or attempts to answer) this question.But this one minor quibble is not enough to make me downgrade this film. It is an absolutely stunning achievement by any stretch of the imagination, and it contains some interesting thematic and technical echoes of both Citizen Kane (cavernous high ceiling scenes, a March of Time-type newsreel on Nixon, a dinner scene between Dick and Pat at a long, impersonal table) as well as The Godfather (the burnished, half-dark half-light cinematography, several chamber of power scenes in tight, dark and claustrophobic rooms)that I found, in context, to be totally appropriate. It paints both Nixon and the times he (and the country) lived through on a grand and mythic scale that was truly awesome and, once again, entirely appropriate. Yes, it's a film that is at times big, loud and bombastic (because so, after all, was Nixon himself) but, just as often quiet, contemplative and told at an achingly *human* level. The contrast between these two states is what gives the film a good deal of its overall power and, as I've said, I never would have believed that Stone would have been capable of doing the smaller, quieter scenes so well.This is a good film to have on tape or DVD, for two reasons. It's so long, and so dense with facts, characters and events, that you're not likely to want to watch it all the way straight through (the first time I saw it was in the theater and though I was held spellbound, I began wishing for an intermission at about the two-hour mark, not so much to stretch my legs but to give my brain a chance to process all I'd seen and heard so far). Also, and more importantly, the videotape includes after the credits two scenes cut out of the final film for time purposes. In both cases, I believe, a severe mistake was made - these are both, I believe, ESSENTIAL sequences; not just nice to have as an additional bargain, but scenes which Stone should have fought tooth and nail to keep in (even cutting out some others if he had to - my vote would have been to excise a few of those Pat Nixon scenes instead). Once scene involves Nixon's visit to the CIA and another a discussion between Nixon and J. Edgar Hoover in the Oval Office. The first scene is a masterpiece of writing and acting (with Sam Waterston as CIA Director Richard Helms, otherwise in no other scene of the movie) and the other is, I think, key in understanding Nixon's motivation to begin taping his White House conversations in the first place (also - an issue which is touched on no other place in the movie). I feel that these two scenes should be edited back into their appropriate places in the movie; seeing them separated from the rest of the film is better than not seeing them at all, but they really belong as part of the entire story.

We see the 'plumbers' donning rubber gloves, and the president fumbling with a few of his tapes, but detail is almost totally eschewed.  There is no Egil Krogh, no Jeb Magruder.  Kleindienst and Gray are mentioned only in passing.  Cox is fired by way of a spoken TV bulletin, Jaworski is not referred to at all.  We do not see anything of the titanic courtroom struggles, with all three branches of the federal government locking horns.  Though we are told that the American Constitution is self-righting, like a boat immune from capsize, we are not shown how or why.     And in this, Oliver Stone is perfectly right.  As it stands, the film is very long, and dense with detail.  There is no room for the minutiae of the cover-up, which in any event would make for a confusing narrative.  Stone's subject is Nixon the man, not the edifice that toppled around him.     And what a man.  Richard Milhous Nixon is a truly fascinating personality - both statesman and charlatan ruthless and vulnerable unable to express his emotions, yet the most emotional of politicians a man who spent his life in the law and in high office, but who never absorbed the legal and ethical mores of public life.  Genius and crook, bold visionary and spiteful backstabber, Nixon will continue to spellbind biographers for decades to come.     That's when it starts, says Stone's Nixon, when you're a kid.  The film takes us to Whittier, California in 1925 to see the unloved boy who struggled painfully to earn his parents' approval, without ever quite succeeding.  As a teenager, he levered his way into the school football squad by sheer willpower.  Lacking talent, he doggedly subjected himself to repeated physical battering in the scrimmages, a tackle dummy with guts.  This syndrome recurs throughout his career.  Always susceptible to scathing criticism, never quite commanding respect, Nixon never the less kept ploughing back into the melee when wiser, lesser men would have quit.  It is hardly surprising that the years of punishment should have left psychological scars.     Nixon's hatred of John Kennedy had more than one source.  He was devastated by the defeat in the 1960 presidential election, but not simply because of disappointment at losing, or even because the Kennedy victory carried the odour of fraud bitterest of all for Nixon was the realisation that the Kennedy people had played hardball more effectively than the Republicans.  Nixon had been out-sharked, and it hurt.  On a more profound level still, John Kennedy was everything that Nixon could never be.  He was a smooth, handsome prince among men, exuding poise and confidence, a patrician imbued with the habit of authority.  To Nixon, the perpetual outsider, the quaker geek who looked shoddy and disreputable, Kennedy seemed to have the dice unfairly loaded in his favour.  JFK was an East Coast bright boy and war hero, fabulously wealthy and impeccably well-connected.  Nixon owned nothing and knew nobody, and was all too obviously 'on the make'.  The great witch-hunts, of Hiss in the 1940's and Ellsberg in the 1970's, are manifestations of the chip on Nixon's shoulder, the fathomless bile that he directed at East Coast college boys.     Nixon always imagined that he was hiding his pain from the world, whereas in fact it was on global display.  His nervous little laugh at moments of emotional crisis was so false, so gut-wrenchingly inappropriate, that the onlooker could catch a glimpse of the man's tortured soul.  Hopkins captures the wretched laugh with devastating effectiveness, both in the scene where Nixon is confronted by a hostile man in the TV studio audience, and when he solemnly promises that none of the president's men will go to jail.  In the Checkers broadcast and the presidential TV address on Watergate, Nixon tries to assure the camera that he is not a crook, and on both occasions he has the exact opposite effect, confirming to the viewer that that is precisely what he is.  Nixon seems incapable of examining his own conscience there is a hard core which his rational mind cannot penetrate.  Maybe that is why Stone has him referring to himself in the third person throughout the film.     'They' were always out to get Nixon, without it ever being made clear just exactly who 'they' might be.  The imperative for this deeply paranoid man was always to be braced, ready for the coming tackle, or to organise pre-emptive strikes against 'them'.  Obstructing justice and tampering with evidence were, to Nixon, self-defensive steps that did not need to be justified.  It was obvious that such things had to be done.  The mystery at the heart of Watergate - why a president so steeped in criminal conspiracy should tape-record his own intimate conversations - makes sense when viewed from Nixon's end of the telescope.  He had to have the goods on his own men, ready for the day when they turned on him.  It goes even further.  This emotional cripple could not bare his bleeding soul to anyone, so his tapes became his confessional and his confidante.  Stone's film repeatedly shows Nixon in his awkward arms-extended, double V-sign pose.  It is not by chance that it looks like a crucifixion.

Wisely not even trying for an exact likeness, his interpretation of that so-familiar physicality is uncannily evocative.  From the very start, the characterisation is spot-on - the jut of the lower jaw, the growly voice, the rounded shoulders.  Once the viewer has adjusted to the initial shock, Hopkins IS Nixon.  It ceases to be an issue.Theodore Roosevelt, Washington, Kennedy and (most of all) Lincoln look down from the White House walls at Nixon, their solemn portraits hovering like admonishing ghosts over the Watergate squalor.  In life, Roosevelt was bold and self-assured, whereas Nixon dithers Washington's self-effacing propriety confronts a Nixon who is suggesting that the Nazis were right. Kennedy is everything that Nixon could never be - above all else, at ease with himself.  Lincoln looks down, from the office wall and from his marble seat in the Memorial, in silent rebuke as his successor debases the presidency.Some of the camera tricks don't work.  We see Nixon rooted to the spot at Love Field as the camera soars up and away from him.  Why?  Obtrusive camera movement is justified only if it adds to our understanding of character or plot.  This shot seems to have been included merely for its cleverness.  The same is true of the little flashes of black-and-white which keep interrupting the action.  At one point, in a dialogue between Nixon and Haldeman, the focus is un-subtly and repeatedly thrown from one man to the other.  What does this achieve?  Is some artistic goal being pursued, or are the effects included for their own sake?  What is the symbolic importance (if any) of the vanishing racehorses?Much of the attention to detail is of a very high order.  Stone's writing team has done its homework, and we get authentic touches such as Nixon's love of log fires, which meant having to run the White House air conditioning system at full blast during summer.  The reconstructions of the White House interiors are superb.  We see Nixon and Pat engaging in a domestic scrap beneath murals of more edifying battles like Yorktown and Saratoga.  Historical events, recorded on news film at the time, are brilliantly reconstituted, replacing the real Nixon with the Hopkins version.  Thus we get convincing reconstructions of the Kennedy TV debate and the 1962 'retirement' speech.  Young Nixon's courtship of Pat is narrated without dialogue as a grainy, jumpy home movie - and is beautifully done.  I did not feel quite so positive about the Alger Hiss segment. Welles did this 'newsreel flashback' idea in Citizen Kane more than half a century earlier, and did it with such flair that anything which follows is sure to look jaded.  It also seemed to me that this passage is badly-placed, coming immediately after the 1962 California defeat.James Wood plays Bob Haldeman, and does his usual admirable, photogenic best.  My quibble with the characterisation is, this isn't THE Haldeman. The historical personage was grimmer, more stately, more formidable (Fred Emery's Watergate bears this out).  Wood is restricted here to the role of an aide, rather than the Chief of the White House Staff, an emperor within his own (not inconsiderable) domain.Pat Nixon does not ring true either, but for different reasons.  Joan Allen is more than competent as the steely, astute power behind the Nixon throne.  The fault is in the characterisation rather than the actor.  The real Pat was (so far as one can judge) an altogether less articulate, less philosophical, less knowing individual.  Watch her in the REAL Checkers broadcast - she is a stiff, repressed, passive woman, a true 1950's Republican wife, not the power broker that this film would have us believe. It is hard to accept, for example, that Nixon's decision to retire in 1962 was his wife's diktat.There are elements of this otherwise excellent film which simply don't work.  Would the President of the United States REALLY be pulled out of a face-to-face meeting with Brezhnev to deal with some Watergate minutiae? The real-life Mitchell said that he tolerated Martha's indiscretions because I love her.  This touching declaration is cheapened in the film, for no good reason.  Similarly, Tricia Nixon's exchange with her father was, in real life, an assertion of unconditional loyalty which was both moving and very much to Nixon's credit.  The film version has her asking sceptically, Did you cover up?  This is quite wrong.  The Nixon women would have considered it treachery even to frame such a question.John Williams' epic score is in keeping with the classical tragedy acted out before us.  Nixon's tearful prayer with Kissinger and the farewell speech to the White House staff are scenes of extraordinary power.Paul Sorvino gives us a marvellous Kissinger, though in my humble opinion Stone goes too far when he makes Kissinger the White House 'leaker' and accuses the Secretary of State of complicity in the Watergate break-ins.One scene which works splendidly is the (true) incident at the Lincoln Memorial.  Nixon tries to glad-hand the indignant youngsters, using the hearty, patronising approach of a bygone generation.  The sad revulsion of the protesters shows the gulf between Nixon's consciousness and the spirit of the age.I hope I haven't let you down is uttered one single time by Nixon, towards the end of the film.  The truth is, he hit on this formula of words and used it again and again during the final days of his presidency.  It was a last desperate attempt to tweak our sympathy-nodes.  As such, it was utterly gauche, utterly craven, utterly guileful, yet utterly unrealistic. In fact, utterly Nixon.

An unhappy childhood, in which he refers to himself as his mother's faithful dog, in fact does dog him his whole life, as he seeks to please a demanding ultra-religious mother (Mary Steenburgen)who had already died by the time he took office as President, but whose memory and expectations lived on. Nixon is burdened with an unhappy marriage to Pat (Joan Allen) - unhappy largely because of his own obsession with political success - and haunted by the ghost of John Kennedy, who defeated him for the presidency in 1960 and who Nixon could never live up to. Kennedy was loved; Nixon was hated - he could never get over that. A scene near the end of the movie demonstrates his feelings toward JFK as he looks at Kennedy's White House portrait They look at you and see what they want to be; they look at me and see who they are.Although the movie - as any review of Nixon's life will - revolves around Watergate, it provides a fascinating summary of his life, and of what added up to make him the troubled and lonely figure he really was. There's also typical Oliver Stone material as dark hints of conspiracy extending far beyond Watergate are inserted. Perhaps the most unsettling being a meeting Nixon has shortly before JFK's assassination with some supporters in Texas who are trying to convince him to run for the presidency again in 1964. Nixon protests that Kennedy can't be beaten in '64. A Cuban American present says ominously What if Kennedy doesn't run in '64?A truly fascinating portrayal of a fascinating man, even in the end somewhat sympathetic to Nixon as the film ends with his 1994 funeral service, some comments at that service by President Clinton and a summary of his career by a narrator pointing out his accomplishments. A last note kudos to Paul Sorvino, who hit Henry Kissinger bang on.8/10 "},{"Title":"A Surreal Reality","Date":"13 July 2008","Score":"30 out of 32 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Biography, Drama, History","Review":" I will start by saying I am an Oliver Stone fan. For some particular reason though I did not expect to like this movie but obviously I did. He actually unexpectedly gave a very fair depiction of Nixon. Nixon really transformed before my eyes in here. That was really something special to see.The acting was quite good. Anthony Hopkins though totally uplifted this movie. I could imagine many people saying his performance was over-the-top or a bit too surreal at times. Yet that is what really made his performance so amazing. The way he was able to transform the many crazy and totally off the wall aspects of Nixon and make them into a reality. To me as the movie went on I felt I was in some way able to see his paranoia, anxiety, thirst for power and just the simple fact of wanting to be liked. I could see he was more of a troubled and vulnerable man than a monster. He never quite connected with anybody which made him bitter and fueled his paranoia and greed even more. To me Hopkins portrayed this all perfectly, all the complexities and inner feelings of Nixon. Hopkins slipped into this role in way that you rarely see. He became Nixon, and at times I was speechless or should I say thoughtless watching him portray such an important figure in such a way. More and more I felt sorry for Nixon, as he looked more and more like a schizophrenic. To me this role was more psychologically bone-chilling than his role as Hannibal Lechter in Silence of the Lambs and I have no problem debating that. The rest of the cast was quite good as well. Joan Allen was very good in showing the complex relationship/marriage she had with Richard Nixon. James Woods freaked me out at times displaying that pure evil and hatred at times that Hopkins showed as Nixon. Paul Sorvino was very good as Henry Kissinger. Mary Steenburgen was interesting to watch in the very limited time she played in here. The two actors though other than Hopkins though that really stood out to me were Bob Hoskins and Sam Waterston. Despite Hoskins not giving an amazing performance and having very limited time he gave me chills just seeing J. Edgar Hoover being portrayed in some sort of way. Sam Waterston despite being limited to really just one scene was even more chilling than the rest of the cast(excluding Hopkins) combined in that one moment. That moment was one of the most intense face to face scenes that I have ever seen. It was so memorable.The directing was very good. It was not the best I have seen from Oliver Stone but it was up there. For the first 45 minutes or so I was a bit confused about what was happening and the flow of the movie but I got used to it. The first portion of the movie did feel unbalanced at times but the feel of the movie got better as it wore on. Going back to that one scene between Sam Waterston and Anthony Hopkins, I felt this scene was one of the best directed and written scenes I have seen from Oliver Stone or anyone ever. That scene was a microcosm of the movie. The motion-sickness, mind scrambling, paranoid feeling of that scene captured the entire movie. The feeling of even seeing the president himself being treated like a puppet, despite not that shocking, was mind numbing to watch. That scene was true testament to the writing and directing abilities of Oliver Stone.The writing was also very good throughout. It seemed as if everything Stone wanted to get across got across. The writing was not amazing but it certainly served it duty. The cinematography was great though. Stone always knows how to get his point across in the way he photographs a movie even if all of other aspects of the movie fail. That dark Oliver Stonish feeling kept on creeping in on every scene, but also that dark psychological feeling that he had put in Born On the Fourth of July and Platoon also was felt through the cinematography. The music by John Williams, who always knows how to capture a moment musically, was simply perfect in here again.I can understand this movie being boring to a lot of people or it being considered propaganda. Yet I think this movie is an overlooked masterpiece. Just seeing Anthony Hopkins perform as Nixon is a good enough reason to see this movie. He took control of this movie by force and took it to another level. Despite this being an Oliver Stone movie it is more fair than you would think. Of course this movie may have a few conspiracy theories included in it but Oliver Stone never forces his theories on people. There is a reason why at the beginning at every movie he puts a disclaimer saying that not everything in his movies are facts. Despite it being great I don't know if this is a movie for everyone. This movie seems to be crazy and surreal but isn't that how life seems to be at times as well?

His Nixon is a complex man, full of ambition and dreams, but also filled with demons.  Nixon  lives in the shadow of JFK, and because of that, he feels he can never live up to the greatness  that he aspires to.  Joan Allen is equally convincing as Pat Nixon.  She is a strong woman who  loves her husband, but unlike Nixon, she grows tired of the political world.  The film works best  when we see the inner workings of the Nixon Whitehouse.

It's hard to cram an entire lifetime into a three hour film, but Stone manages  to do it well.  We get brief glimpses into Nixon's past and we see the events that eventually  undid him.  Some may say that Nixon is painted in an unfair light.  I think Stone actually  sympathizes with him.  Here was a man who came into power in the middle of a war.

The 37th president of the U.S. lost the 1960 presidential election to JFK and then lost the California governor race of 1962. By 1963 it appears that Nixon is out of the spotlight for good politically and that he is struggling to keep his marriage to Pat Nixon (a superb turn by Oscar-nominee Joan Allen in arguably her finest role) alive. Things turn strange though as Nixon has strange meetings with big-time oil men in Texas (Larry Hagman leading the group) and even with J. Edgar Hoover (scene-stealer Bob Hoskins). It is obvious that there are some potentially sinister things going on from high-ranking people. Soon JFK is assassinated, the 1964 election becomes a mess for both parties as LBJ wins by default and then LBJ decides not to run in 1968. The Republicans once again turn to Nixon, but Nixon (full of self-doubt and inferiority complexes) is fearful that 1968 against RFK will be a repeat of 1960 (Nixon believes that JFK and the Democrats stole the 1960 presidency). More cloak and dagger situations occur and RFK is assassinated in California, leaving the door open for Nixon to win the presidency. Vietnam, a whole host of questionable allies (led by James Woods, E.G. Marshall, J.T. Walsh, David Paymer, David Hyde Pierce, Powers Boothe, Fyvush Finkel) and constant advisement from Henry Kissinger (an amazing transformation by Paul Sorvino, who rivals Hopkins' performance the whole way) end up turning Nixon's life upside down. Soon taped White House conversations and growing paranoia also pops up and public/national/international/military/social chaos ensues. While all this occurs the president's personal life is shown through flashbacks (Mary Steenburgen as his mother and Tony Goldwyn as his older brother dominate these parts of the film). We see two of his brothers dying of tuberculosis, his short courtship of his wife and various other parts of his early life that stand out. The Watergate break-in (led by Ed Harris) continues to be one of the strangest things that has ever happened (the motives of the apparent burglary have never been clear). 18 minutes of missing audio recordings are one of the biggest mysteries of the 20th Century. Director Oliver Stone (who received an Oscar nod for co-writing the script) surprisingly is unbiased with this film. Watching Platoon, Born on the Fourth of July and JFK would lead one to believe that Stone would pull no punches with Nixon. However he gives Nixon's story an element of truth and compassion. There are so many unknown things that went on with Nixon throughout his political career that Stone has to fill in lots of missing pieces with speculations (some that seem very logical and some not so much). Thus the film goes on and on (running about 195 minutes). Even with all the airtime though the film does not move slowly and never becomes dull. In fact it is one of those projects that could have gone on even longer and it still would have been an interest-generator. Whether you like, dislike or are indifferent when it comes to Nixon the person, Nixon the movie is an outstanding achievement that stands high with Stone's better works and also deceptively becomes one of the more under-rated and under-appreciated pictures of the 1990s. 5 stars out of 5.

But as a political science junkie and a history nerd, I always found this film to be very entertaining and fun to watch, especially if you're a historian who's also read other books on the Nixon administration, All the President's Men, etc.This film gives a very raw look into the world of the Presidency and politics. I think Hopkins did a wonderful job as Nixon, as well as the rest of the cast (namely Bob Hoskins as J. Edgar Hoover and Ed Harris as E. Howard Hunt). From a historian's perspective, I think it did a fair job of looking at what Nixon's career was like, the disappointments he experienced, the struggles he made, the mistakes he committed, and the situation he found himself in once he finally became President. The film's a bit long (especially the redone version = 3.5 hours), but I think it's worth it.And I'm fully aware of Oliver Stone's background. I've always had a mixed reaction with Mr. Stone. Two of my favorite films ever are Nixon and Alexander (and I'm even a Greek Republican), yet the only film I've ever walked out on was JFK. JFK was just too much; the only assassination theory Stone didn't throw in it was the UFO theory. But as far as Nixon goes, I commend Stone for giving a fair portrayal of him, knowing what a notorious liberal he is. And once again, this is coming from a moderate Republican.Extremists will hate this film. Ultra-conservatives will look as this film with skepticism and claim it's BS while radical liberals will claim it's too sympathetic toward Nixon. But for anyone with open eyes who isn't narrow-minded one way or the other, or for anyone interested in what the world of politics is like, I highly recommend this film. Like I said, it's always been one of my all-time favorites. "}{"Title":"My Avaricious Constituency- Go Ahead!!

In a time of transition with American values, Richard Nixon had to succumb to a Keynesian resolution to the United States' economic woes!! Relentlessy burdening inflation reduced the nation to a quasi socialist measure of wage and price control!! Oil dependency on the Arabs was formidably alarming!! To top it all off, the ubiquitous monster of continued involvement in the Vietnam War was constantly rearing it's ugly head!! Such an atrocity brought on a bevy of anti-war protesters in front of the White House lawn on an ephemeral basis!! Now descends the left wing liberal ideological philosophy of desegregation through busing!! Political plea bargaining coerced Richard Nixon to renege on his pledges to corporate giants who put him in the White House in 1968!! Nixon's insolence and self righteousness incensed everybody!! His mainstream appeal was due to extremes on both sides of the political spectrum, two such examples are; George Wallace (Right) and George McGovern (Left). The cacophony of foul language and racial hatred by the Nixon White House was deplorable!! Why? Nixon was the commander in chief of the United States!! An insidious aspect to this hatred was very nauseating because it signified how many Americans who were likened to the mindset of Nixon cabinet, actually thought!! These dubious conceptions of the Nixon cabinet were perplexing the American people as to what actual ideologies were implementing a resolution on the final decisions made pertaining to copious political issues!! The egalitarian pretenses that these politicians so often masqueraded, were merely a facade!! This film's full persecutive of Richard Nixon's political life was a laboriously successful rendition of Nixon's volatile temperament, this haunting character portrayal was flawlessly executed by world renowned director, Oliver Stone!! In so many of his movies, Oliver Stone is uncanny in his ability to itemize a comprehensive hatred with the characters in his film.. When making this movie about Richard Nixon, the former president of the United States, he (Oliver Stone) depicts the intensity of how abhorrent Nixon's philosophical proclivities actually were!! Oliver Stone accurately pinpoints the composite personality of Nixon as a social anathema who was a victim of his fundamentalist environment!! In giving my assessment of President Nixon, allow me to say this I am a Republican, I have empathized with Richard Nixon concerning his candor with regard to human imperfection, at the same time, this does not mean that he should have cultivated a Carte Blanche to repetitively engage in egregious human character discrepancies!! Nixon did not contest the 1960 Presidential race against John F. Kennedy, even though, many of his advisers encouraged him to do so!! Such a protestation was on account of the contention that some states had allegedly fixed the election by stuffing their ballot boxes!! Nixon felt it was in the best interest of his political career not to pursue this matter!! In so doing this, he resented JFK and the rest of the prominent Kennedys all of his life... I would not be too fond of someone who massacred me in a string of nationally televised debates either!! Nixon's words for John F Kennedy were The American people looked at JFK and saw what they wanted to be, they look at me and see what they are!! Nixon's biggest problem was that he made an enemy out of everyone!! This was a president who was all too anxious to lay blame to the fact that he was grotesquely misunderstood as being the culprit to his disheveled presidency!! While he ended the Vietnam War, this is like saying that after you stabbed someone's hand, you stopped the bleeding!! This film points out how Nixon isolated all political coalitions with whom he had to corroborate, that was his undoing!! This precarious situation brought on his ultimate political nemesis.. Watergate... The Washington Post's unearthing of the Watergate break-in brought on a revolutionary breach of public trust in the system of American democracy, hence, all of the media affiliates converged accordingly!! Nixon's post as an appointed public official was viewed by him with a sanctimonious temerity, thus, he invoked executive clemency as an indelible prerogative to quell investigation into the Watergate affair. What was infuriating to the American people was that the executive branch of the United States government could be complicit in the crime involving a third rate burglary!! Talks of espionage, sabotage, and wiretapping evoked a very distasteful resolve with the American public!! Henry Kissinger, H R Halderman, and President Nixon, were the triumvirate in the Oval office who mandated the use of the fifth amendment!! Such theatrics were construed by the American people as actions which were tantamount to an admission of culpability by the Nixon Administration!! Nixon's presumed innocence was contingent on his option for executive privilege!! This privilege was revoked by the supreme court on account of the fact that the Nixon administration was up against criminal charges!! The movie Nixon portrayed Watergate with an ultimate clarity, yes, it was nurtured with a liberal bias, at the same time, this was the Rolls Royce of Republican blundering, therefore, it was time for the opposing party to capitalize on the entire matter!! The acting in this movie was sensational!! James Woods was terrific as H R Halderman, Joan Allen portrayed Pat Nixon with a very succinct realism... Paul Sorvino's role as Henry Kissinger was simply fantastic!! and of course, Anthony Hopkins proves his acting genius once again, with the part of Richard Nixon, as he is one of the best actors in the history of all movie making... The camera angles and the severity of agitated emotions is spellbinding with this movie!! See this Film, it is a definite winner!!

Yet his Nixon is not only the harrowing political biography of the most controversial and unpopular President of the United States, but also the gripping psychological study of a tormented man who got too much to prove. It's also a terrific movie served by an impressive casting Anthony Hopkins, Joan Allen, James Woods, Bob Hoskins, Ed Harris, E.G. Marshall, Madeline Kahn and an unrecognizable Paul Sorvino as Henry Kissinger. And it's definitely one of the best movies of 1995, which is saying a lot.Nixon borrows a lot of elements from JFK on the editing department, swinging back and forth from childhood memories to the present, from the Watergate scandal to its dark premises. The film is complex, almost confusing but never gratuitously because Nixon himself happens to be an enigmatic and larger-than-life character. Roger Ebert even compared the film to Citizen Kane, establishing an interesting parallel between Richard Nixon and Charles Foster Kane. Nixon does remind of Kane in his excesses, his capability to be disdained by the establishment yet respected within his inner circle, and his heart consumed by an unconscious desire to be loved while trying to hide a torment deeply rooted in his childhood.The comparison is even truer because like Kane, Nixon hides a terrible secret, although the missing eighteen minutes from the White House recordings would unveil something more unpleasant than the mysterious 'Rosebud'. Behind every great man, there's a secret, but in Nixon's case, there's also a woman. And as Pat Nixon, Joan Allen delivers a subtle but pivotal performance as the woman who evolves in her husband's shadow but in her own supportive way, acts as the only guardian angel of a man who sold his soul to a certain Machiavellian view of power. She believes in his talent to win the election, but not the hearts, people would never love him because she knows how uneasy it was for her to love him.The chronicles of a man who could never be loved, that could be indeed the subtitle of Nixon's journey in the White House, in his whole political career actually. Indeed, Nixon won two elections, opened China, signed a nuclear treaty with Russia, ended the longest war America ever knew, but as great achievements as they were, Nixon's dark side eclipsed them Vietnam, Cambodia, Allende, the Watergate. In his most lucid moments, Nixon even recognizes that his road to success was paved by dead bodies, he could go to college because his older brother died of tuberculosis, Jack Kennedy was assassinated, then Bobby, his luck carried the seeds of his doom. This is when the comparison with JFK stops, it's not an investigation but a character study. And as Dick Nixon, Anthony Hopkins never tries to make an impersonation but rather creates his own personification of an eternal outcast, haunted by the ghosts from the past, a man who always had to forge his carapace, by building his own legend through his modest Quaker background in the poorest farm of California, always using it as an alibi to justify that he's one of the 'little people'. And when an outcast experiments the power, and tastes its irreplaceable savor after the post-War republican wave, he can't renounce it. Nixon knew he was born to rule the most powerful country of the world, like a personal revenge Only if you have been in the deepest valley, can you ever know how magnificent it is to be on the highest mountain. This taste for revenge is his inner demon.I'm not comparing two characters, but Nixon kind of reminded me of Downfall in the way the White House is showed, as a sort of bunker where the state's ugliest secrets are covered, a shadowy and gloomy place waiting for the enemy (here the media) to come to the leader. And one by one, like a sinking ship, every faithful soldier is drown in the scandal, and Nixon, as the Captain, is the last to leave. Ebert wrote about Bruno Ganz' performance as Hitler Admiration I did not feel. Sympathy I felt in the sense that I would feel it for a rabid dog, while accepting that it must be destroyed. In a lesser measure of course, I think this could work as the right answer to those who believed that Stone, a notorious left wing, created empathy toward Nixon. Stone never used his patriotism at the expenses of intelligence. Nixon is responsible of his downfall but a whole system is to blame, Nixon was flawed but his enemies weren't nobler. And that's what Stone brilliantly denounces. In many scenes, Nixon reminds the Press of its lack of objectivity, its obsession and outspoken hatred. These words are still relevant today; Nixon is the quintessential incarnation of the 'person we love to hate'. Indeed, with his victory sign trademark, his sweating and angry look contrasting with Kennedy's shining smile, from his I'm not a crook to his dog Checkers, from his resignation to The Simpsons (he even inspired through his middle-name the name of Milhouse) to hold-up masks, he's in his way, an icon of popular culture, or unpopular if you prefer. Nixon appears as an individual whose republican obedience veiled his true idealism, his fascination for Lincoln, the President who ended the Civil War, or Kennedy as a beloved figure. People look at Kennedy and want to be him, but when they look at them, they find Nixon, less than a low self-esteem; it's a sentiment of total waste that invades his heart when he look at Kennedy's picture during his last night in the White House. Nixon's tragedy is America's, and maybe that's why he was loathed, because people don't want to look at themselves.

Kennedy, his opposite came down to supplant. From handsome, quiet, and peaceful everybody's lovely older brother to ugly, nervous and fond of war everybody's grumpy boss. The opposition can't get more extreme and dark. It's the womanizer who became praised idol vs. the faithful married who became pelted icon. Balanced rich vs. complicated poor. Honest vs. lair. Perfect god vs. imperfect human if you will. The problem isn't in the irony; it's in the events that the irony produced, especially after the first was killed, and the latter took over.Now Stone's Nixon is somehow close to my conception. Stone handled him through one question; what could possibly lead to the Watergate scandal? In search for an answer he went into Nixon's whole life; a huge bet Stone fell for and fell over due to I suppose. He could have exposed Nixon by Watergate, not analyzing him all the way to it. The general title, along with the film's main question, produced a long and acrid reading for Nixon that caused Stone endless accusations of no objectivity. However Stone managed to portray an interesting complex he saw in the 37th president.Stone's Nixon did good things, yet lost others; his respect (needless war seemed going forever), and his honor (Watergate). The way his psychological deepness is explored represents the best of the film. The dreary kid, who's too sad to smile, found himself carrying his 2 late brothers' dreams, then the post-Kennedy's dreams, while he originally didn't choose. And when he did; it was nothing but confusion, impetuosity and lying. He always played a role, till the circumstances gifted him with one bigger than his capacities; look how, in intelligently metaphorical shot, the 3 advancing horses overturned accidentally in a moment made the road wide open for a late horse, that doesn't necessarily have to be the fitter. After John Kennedy's assassination, president Johnson's withdrawal, and Robert Kennedy's assassination, Nixon had the wild opportunity that he never dreamed of. Like he was the best of the available, but not the best.Nixon appears as that suppressed irritable sweat machine, who suffers a lastingly lost comparison with Kennedy. He wanted to be as Kennedy, but by his own, anti-Kennedy, ways. While being conservative and violent, he never won the beloved rank of the previous president that even his haters, such as the white house's servant, bewailed him the day he died. Yet he tried, hardly, to attain that missing love. Hence Watergate was a fit climax for his too cautious, too scared nature. The film's smartest point is its convincing conclusion; Nixon couldn't be Kennedy, couldn't beat Kennedy's super halo, ending up as only a human, defeated by his ordinariness; When they look at you, they see what they want to be. When they look at me, they see what they are..The problems  Regardless of the actual running times of Stone's other films, these 192 minutes were his longest to date. The conversations led everything. They were so lengthy with no redeeming image. Relying on Kennedy's complex went on and on; there is nearly no scene where Nixon doesn't mention Kennedy in a vexatious comparison. I couldn't understand the wife's sudden change from leaving the house, objecting to the decision of reelecting in a second, to dancing joyfully, celebrating the decision in the next?Yet nothing is stranger than Nixon's speech at the finale. It was &#x96; to my surprise &#x96; pictured, by camera, editing and music, as an over soppy farewell, filled with desperately idealistic Nixon, and a sort of sad elegizing for him. Is it a side of Stone's objectivity?, or is it some honoring reaction towards Nixon's death around the time the film was completed? Whatever the reason is, I didn't buy it. Compared to the film's context it comes off as uncanny, late and deficient rehabilitation, or sudden hypocrisy ! Even Nixon's voice has been altered there to Hopkins's rational, confident and smooth tone !Stone, the director I love, wasn't there for all the time. He was busy just shooting those huge pages of dialogs. Using black and white image sometimes was a failed trick to shatter the bore of the long talkative scenes. The thing is; the original Stone-ish touches don't show up, and when they do; they don't work. Enough to say, and to pain, I don't remember a scene, rather a moment, where I felt Oliver Stone the distinct director.John Williams's score was as tragic as the events, and sorry for it, though without special appeal. Director of photography Robert Richardson was in total suffocation. He had no chance to prove any singularity, except looking polished, and as strained and scary as Nixon sometimes; see how the shadows of the hearth's fires are used in certain scenes. The acute editing embodied rightly a demented Nixon's world, while stopping helpless in front of an entry that lost the film a more graceful figure. I thought it would have been better if Stone directed a political thriller about Watergate's interrogations (the film sounds having that ambition at its core). But instead, he ramified in inflated manner, digressing to Edgar Hoover and else, making heavy, monotonous and weary film. Hmm, maybe being heavy, monotonous and weary is what Nixon means for Stone. Though, making a film about a character is one thing, and resembling him is another, dangerous, thing, as much as Stone's Nixon is involved.

There are bound to be as many IMDb users on either side of the Atlantic whom will disagree with mine or other users comments in why JFK is a disappointing film for a number of reasons and stop believing that Kennedy was killed by a conspiracy because in fact there wasn't one. Much had already been written and discussed about JFK by film and history experts prior to the making of Nixon when they were fully certain that Nixon by Oliver Stone would be the next to fall into that category and they were right for Nixon opened with poor reviews also for being a mixture of truth and fiction and there was one such scene with Henry Kissinger smoking cigars when the real Kissinger said that he actually never smoked them. Like JFK, the film is lengthy at nearly three and quarter hours from start to finish and is slightly more frustrating to watch. Sometimes, the film is spoilt by the use of such sexually-explicit words like...er....er... you know.... followed by Nixon's wife wanting a divorce. Being set in the sixties and seventies, it makes me wonder if such language like this was ever used at that time but in the case of film Nixon, this was made in 1995 and unless I am wrong, perhaps it was the way Oliver Stone puts it together.

Three hours of power mad, Blew up Cambodia, certifiably insane, Evil Nixon (TM).I do not know what film some other reviewers were watching, but it certainly was not the same one I saw. The film is three hours in duration, and yet manages to only pack about five minutes of fact into its content. There is absolutely no historical perspective or context given to any of Nixon's decisions, the worst example of which was the film's depiction of the bombing campaign against the Khmer Rouge and North Vietnamese army in Cambodia. Showing a callous Nixon and stock footage of bombs dropping hardly does that involved and complex issue justice, and merely serves to stereotype Nixon further.The scene towards the end of the film where Kissinger and Haig await Nixon's signature on his resignation letter is perhaps even more absurd. To even remotely suggest, as this scene does, that Nixon considered imposing martial law to retain his grip on power simply ignores all reality. This was the same man who chose not to challenge the 1960 election, and more importantly, resigned the presidency before there was ever even an impeachment trial in the Senate. Hardly the moves someone supposedly as power mad as Nixon should've made.This does not even address Stone's hopelessly absurd theories regarding the 18 1/2 minute gap or the director's sad obsession with the Kennedy assassination. Perhaps Stone could do himself and all of us a favor by ceasing to relive and rewrite the tortured 1960s and instead make a film about Cambodia under Pol Pot, whose victory Evil Nixon's (TM) bombing campaign was attempting to prevent.

Anthony Hopkins is nothing short of amazing in the film. Hopkins plays the role of the late Richard Nixon. The film has a great perspective of the psychological issues Nixon went through from his days as a boy to his resignation as president.The movie shows many of these issues and how they manifested themselves to Nixon's fall from grace. First, we see the threatening nature of his father combined with the saint-like qualities of his mother and how they affected him. We see Nixon later feel haunted by the Kennedy family and the success John and Bobby had rising up the political ranks until their lives were tragically ended. We see Nixon's overwhelming desire for the presidency tests his marriage to Pat, brilliantly played by Joan Allen. In addition, we see a man who feels he is above the law during the late part of his first term. In summary, all of his demons haunt him and this is brilliantly displayed in the film.I also liked to see the drama inside the White House. The statesman Henry Kissinger, played by Paul Sorvino, was great and his accent was very similar to the real Kissinger. We see Bob Haldeman (James Woods) portrayed as anti-Semitic with his cruel comments about Kissinger's background. David Hype Pierce of Frasier fame plays John Dean, a man who vowed to not take the fall for the Watergate scandal. As the movie develops, we are intrigued with the drama and how the administration fell apart. Hopkins' outrage in the Oval Office after a conference telling of the withdrawal from Vietnam is great acting. We see Nixon feel appreciated by the people. He then blames Ted Kennedy for the press' questions about Watergate.Joan Allen's role has been criticized by some others but I thought it was top-notch. She plays Nixon's wife who stands up to her husband upon losing in the California governor race in 1962. She threatens him with divorce and he says to the press core you won't have Nixon to kick around anymore. After LBJ decides to not run, he changes his mind and runs in 1968. Pat at first is upset but then allows him to run. However, during his presidency, Pat calls out her husband as they don't vacation together and he changes as the quest for power and control seriously damages the marriage. She plays the loyal wife but does get her two cents in.The rest of the cast is top-notch to say the least. Bob Hoskins plays the manipulative J. Edgar Hoover who has a major grudge against the Kennedys. Powers Boothe plays Alexander Haig, the man who finally convinces Nixon that he is in severe trouble and peril with impeachment looming. E.G. Marshall plays the bitter John Mitchell. Mary Steenburgen plays Nixon's mother whose life and influence overshadow her son's life in several occasions through the film. Larry Hagman plays Jack Jones, a Texas man (reminds me of his role on Dallas) who once was an ally to Nixon but their alliance falls apart later in the film. A great line from Hagman Mr. President, do you forget who got you where you are? Nixon The American people did. HagmanOh really? That can be changed.I have seen the movie three times and intrigued by it every time. I wished I had seen when it first came out. If you love history or intrigued by the crucial period of the late 60's and early 70's, you will love this movie! Highly rated!

Walsh as John Ehrlichman; James Woods as Bob Haldeman; David Hyde Pierce as John Dean among many others. Taking a non-linear approach, the movie jumps back and forth between many different periods and events, from Nixon's strict upbringing at the hands of his Quaker mother, through the many peaks and valleys of his political career, to his downfall in the wake of the Watergate scandal. The facts of his life are blended with supposition and speculation to create a portrait that is often critical of the man's policies but displays an unexpected compassion toward his failings as a human being.The film is obviously thoughtful, well-researched and carefully modulated when presenting the late President,Richard Nixon as tries to paint him as a human being with flaws and the viewer gets a glimpse of both his persona and psyche.When viewing this film,thoughts of Hamlet, Macbeth and King Lear come to mind as the viewer witness a ruler destroyed by his fatal flaws and weaknesses. Also,credit the great performances of the cast particularly Anthony Hopkins and Joan Allen as they elevate the film to a level of greatness not achieved by other films.And most of all,Nixon is the epic motion picture that delves into the inner sanctum of a tragic world leader, uncovering his greatest moments and his shattering demise in Watergate.

If I had to quibble I would say that Joan Allen makes Pat Nixon a far steelier character than she probably was and EG Marshall is too old to play John Mitchell. Oliver Stone does not play too fast and loose with the real story and endeavours to explore Nixon's childhood and other events in his life to try to explain what what made him what he became.

Cinemagraphically the film seems rather hallucinatory at times. Odd angles and various film stocks are implemented to great effect. The narrative is non-linear accomplished by a stark and impressionistic editorial approach. I was overwhelmed with the sensation of participating in a completely subjective interpretation of history rather than documentary. Now lets talk about how brilliant Anthony Hopkins is in the title role. His portrayal is at time vulnerable and insecure then shifts into the hysterics that seem the inevitable sum of such flaws. The always phenomenal Joan Allen almost steals the show as Pat Buddy Nixon. Can I admit that the film nearly brought me to tears? Sure I can...the Nixon movie got me all glassy eyed.

For a start, it crams as much detail as it can into three hours, with a brilliant cast and a sweeping John Williams score. It deals with almost all the most important aspects of American political life of the era, the vast majority of which are still as relevant as ever, especially given the current right-wing US administration. It portrays Nixon sympathetically and devotes as much screen time to his achievements as it does to his famous fall from grace. It offers a realistic portrayal of a professional politician and credits the viewer with the intelligence to judge his career for themself. In my opinion, it does have some faults though, first and foremost being Hopkins as Nixon. Whilst his performance is dedicated and rings true emotionally, I have difficulty getting past the casting of a short Welshman as an iconic tall American. Similarly, Hoskins is a bravura but bizarre choice for J. Edgar Hoover. These are counterpointed though by many smooth and assured performances from the large ensemble cast; most notably Allen, Boothe, Woods and Sorvino (who is entirely credible as the larger-than-life Henry Kissinger). The movie has some surprising takes on specific individuals, which slightly colours its objectivity. Nixon's counsel John Dean is portrayed as fairly saintly, and also happened to be a technical consultant on the picture. Gordon Liddy, the head guy on the break-in and a pivotal figure in both the cover-up and the various investigations of Nixon's use of campaign funds, has about three seconds of screen time. Some characters (such as the oil baron played by Hagman) are entirely fictitious, which is never a good idea in a biopic - stick to the facts. The crackerjack editing, whilst sometimes brilliantly mixing the cast into newsreel footage from twenty-five years earlier, occasionally lurches into pretension and dissipates the drama. Nixon's constant comparing of himself to his martyred rival John F. Kennedy is probably more an obsession of Stone's than it was of Nixon's. These are personal quibbles however and don't alter the fact that this is a tremendous production of what is fundamentally an amazing true-life story. Nixon was vilified by many people during his lifetime, perhaps justifiably, but often in ignorance of his circumstances and of the machinery of global politics. This movie is an intriguing window into his world, which at the very least shows what motivated him to do what he did. See for yourself.

It's a very non-Hollywood type of movie; despite the big budget and name cast, it usually feels more like an avant-garde film. (Ironically, Disney released this one under its Hollywood Pictures label.) This is not among the director's best work, but it's certainly one of his most challenging, ambitious projects. I can understand why it was a box-office flop; I remember the first time I rented it and had trouble getting a good grasp of all the characters and events of the Nixon presidency, especially with the flashback segments. Nonetheless, I rented it again recently; after having the benefit of being more familiar with Stone's films, perhaps it might improve upon a second viewing? I still felt the same way. It's a cluttered work that lacks the focus of his brilliant JFK, his very best movie. He seems to have made Nixon on the assumption that the audience knows who all these historical figures are, which lost a lot of younger viewers. On the other hand, when I later saw JFK, I didn't know who any of these characters were, but their roles in the picture were fairly easy to figure out if you paid attention. Nixon does not share this characteristic.Still, it's an intriguing film, despite its shortcomings. This is one of the few movies that changed my perspective on a crucial issue. Prior to watching it, I had thoughtlessly accepted the popular notion that the guy was a real crook who was unworthy of being our president. However, the film made me realize that these things are never so clear cut. Nixon made a lot of mistakes, but he had his strengths and a true world vision; his strong foreign policy opened the doors to better relations with China. He is not portrayed as an angel, but as a deeply flawed human being. He had the potential to be one of the greatest world leaders of all time, but his own insecurities cost him his career.Anthony Hopkins doesn't look anything like the late Richard Nixon, but he impersonates him so well that even historians have stated that he captures his personality and mannerisms very accurately. Joan Allen offers a center of morality as Pat Nixon, who silently suffered through her husband's downfall. There are so many supporting actors that one wonders how Stone was able to keep track of them in the first place. My favorites were James Woods as one of his most trusted associates, Bob Hoskins as the infamous J. Edgar Hoover, and Paul Sorvino as Henry Kissinger. I also liked David Hyde Pierce as a member of the White House staff, caught in a tangled web with the Watergate scandal, and Mary Steenburgen as the president's religious mother. Ed Harris has a cameo as well, though I wish it had been possible for him to get more screentime.There are memorable scenes, such as Nixon humbling himself in prayer, or his late-night visit to the Washington Monument. His domestic conflicts from childhood to adulthood ring true as well. In fact, this is one movie that plays better in its individual scenes than as a whole. But that doesn't mean you can count it out. It's not a perfect movie by any means, but it offers a humanistic, surprisingly balanced portrait of one of the most controversial presidents in national history.*** (out of ****)Released by Hollywood Pictures "},{"Title":"It's dark out there !","Date":"24 April 2001","Score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Biography, Drama, History","Review":"  Oliver Stone's movie about Richard Nixon is surely an exercise in 'darkness'.

Anthony Hopkins delivers a performance that truly deserved his Oscar nomination. His acting is amazing. There are so many scenes where he is able to connect with the viewer. I only wish I could say the same about the rest of the cast. Here's a movie that has an all star cast; Joan Allen, James Woods, Bob Hoskins, E.G. Marshall, Paul Sorvino, and Ed Harris. And among all of them, not one of them stand out! Was Stone really that unaware of the talent he had in this movie. Lets take Joan Allen for example. Here's a great actress and she was given such an awful, bland role! There were no memorable moments. The same thing is true with James Woods. I would go as far as to say that James Woods is one of the best actor we have alive today. But, what's the good of it?! Everyone in this movie is mildly or barely used. Another bad thing about this movie is it was filmmed so low key. And by that I mean, there are moments were the film carries no energy. It's just so dull! There were many scenes were I sat there bored. The only other good thing I can say about this movie is I like the way the film doesn't take sides. It doesn't try to lean towards the left by saying that Nixon was a bad President. That he didn't end the war soon enough. And, it doesn't try to lean towards the right. By stating that he was a great President who was misunderstood or wasn't giving a chance. Even though the ending does seem a bit sentimental. The movie doesn't try to be preachy. It lets us decide for our own how we want to look at what Nixon did while in office. It merely trys to state the facts. For people who are young and know little about Nixon the movie can be informative. You will learn about the him and what happened durning his Presidency. For those who were around when it actually happened, there's nothing here that's new for you to see. Overall I can't help feel that this movie is way too long. It a little bit over the 3 hour mark.

Is it simply trying to turn history into cinema and stir up some controversy, similar to what was done with JFK?  Or is it trying to tell a great American tragedy--the tale of a man whose achievement of power caused his downfall due to his underlying psychological makeup being incompatible with handling such power?If the latter was the true aim, much was left out.  There was not enough explanation of how his childhood environment led to his paranoia and intense need to be loved by all.  Much of the conflicts leading up to and during his presidency were also not included here.  I would have preferred including another hour of material to explore Nixon's personality a bit more.I suspect that, due to Nixon's private nature, much more was not known that could be included in the script, and the producers probably already felt over-extended on their poetic license in regards to rewriting history.An example of some good material that was edited out is included following the VHS (and I assume, DVD) version, so be sure to stick around after the credits.Typical Stone fare, similar in style to JFK, this is definitely worth watching, but left me feeling it could have been more.

Not when he was elected vice president of the United States (twice) and not when he was elected president of the United States (twice). He was a profoundly unhappy man given only to degrees of sadness. And while it will no doubt be open season on Nixon for its fast and loose approach to facts, you nonetheless walk out of the theater after 195 minutes of Nixon believing that Stone probably got Nixon's personality right. As one character in the film observes, He's the darkness, reaching out for the darkness.A sprawling psychodrama starring the unlikely Anthony Hopkins as the 37th president, Nixon embraces the gloominess, paranoia and vast contradictions that marked Nixon's tenure on the American stage. He was a Communist witch-hunter of the Joe McCarthy school who pursued improved relationships with the Soviet Union and China; a man who justified his own dastardly deeds by rationalizing that they weren't as offensive as those of his predecessors; the self-loathing product of a working-class family whose envy for the Kennedy clan knew no bounds; a hard-drinking, bigoted, profaning Quaker whose mother and father held to strict Christian codes; and a man who pursued peace in Southeast Asia by way of the most savage conventional bombing in history. Nixon is remarkable for the territory it covers and the passion with which it pursues its subject although it would be unusual for a filmmaker to come up short with such generous time in which to tell the tale of one man's political life. The chief failure of Nixon is we don't come away feeling we've learned anything new except that Stone, the obsessed conspiratorialist who concocted three hours of historical conjecture and called it JFK, is even willing to add Nixon to his list of the thousands who had something to do with John F. Kennedy's death. It's as though the self-destructive filmmaker tries hard to discredit himself. (His cheap-shot gay-bashing attack on J. Edgar Hoover, played by Bob Hoskins, seems excessive.) That Stone may understand on some intimate level Nixon's own worst urges -- the late president did, and Stone still does, take criticism far too personally -- is surely what gives Nixon its power to command our attention. Never mind that we've seen it all before, it is compelling material. The heart of Stone's film is Nixon's Watergate debacle. The cover-up. The so-called enemies list. And so on. But it's a history lesson, too, with Stone flashing back to Nixon's rise, fall -- the infamous You won't have Nixon to kick around anymore comment -- and rebirth in presidential politics, a path paved, as Nixon notes, by the bodies of the Kennedy brothers. Nixon is Stone's impressionistic portrait of the man. In this kind of film, the details are interesting, but almost beside the point. Stone seems fascinated by Nixon's drive to be a great man, and the demons that block his progression. People nowadays love to talk about the character question in politics; well, Nixon is the poster boy for that debate. That Hopkins neither looks nor sounds anything like Nixon is jarring. He attacks the role without the use of makeup or prosthetics, and never seems fully comfortable in the Nixon persona. Yet, that's precisely why the actor is able to locate the essence of Nixon the man, if not Nixon the mask. Nixon was a famously clumsy individual who appeared ill at ease in his own body, and so there is an accuracy in Hopkins' performance. The rest of Stone's acting bench is deep, talented and too voluminous to list. Still, a few stand out James Woods as H.R. Haldeman, Joan Allen as Pat Nixon (humanizing the former first lady for the first time), David Hyde Pierce as John Dean, Paul Sorvino as Henry Kissinger and Madeleine Kahn as Martha Mitchell. Stone is not content, however, to let his actors and his script tell the story. He insists on heavy-handed stylistic intrusions of the sort he used in JFK and Natural Born Killers -- use of multiple film stocks and video imagery within the same scene, rakish angles and other distractions, pulling us out of the story to ponder, Why'd he do that? Nixon is not the great biographical treatise Stone was aiming for, but it is worth a look for those who enjoy a good wallow in the past. It's a sympathetic view of the man, but Nixon, wherever he is, must be fuming.

His plight is ordinary in the sense that it is deeply human, this is how we have retrogradely dramatized Nixon in order to be able to understand his actions. His downfall, also human the desire to cling to the controls of a life that is far beyond our scope or any four-year presidential term.

It is very much Stone doing Nixon; feverish ramblings from personal darkness, powerful but manipulative rhetorics. Shamelessly emotional when it serves a purpose. We're spared nothing in the cinematic onslaught of different footage, dutch angles, slow-motion, light flares, incessant cuts and counter-cuts. No symbolism is too hamfisted blood oozing from a steak as use of nuclear weapons is contemplated, superimpositions of Nixon's face on Mao's as the analogy is being forced, a gigantic Nixon looking pensive superimposed on the skies the day before Dallas. I believe Stone took on Natural Born Killers solely as a test run for the madness of this. Of course that film was a deliberate mess, pitched as hysterical satire. This is hysterically assembled, helter skelter.On the part of Stone, my view is that control was lost from the desire to be America's objective chronicler. In the early stages I believe the film was intended to be one long reverie and internal monologue triggered by the Watergate tapes. No doubt Stone was familiar with Robert Altman's film on Nixon and understood the project to be fundamentally visual. The idea was that we would visit, from this room where an old weary man is listening to his own voice, different stops in a long life in and out of the public eye, looking from both ends, looking for a narrative and who controlled the telling. In lieu with JFK, I believe part of the film was meant to be an unreliable, paranoid testimony shaped from memory. In lieu with JFK where the film was the trial that never happened, this would be the televised public apology that did.

The movie clearly focuses on the Watergate scandal that ultimately caused Richard Nixon's resignation in the early 70s, but through relevant flashbacks actually tells the Nixon story from his childhood. Director Oliver Stone does a masterful job, and Anthony Hopkins proves once more why he is arguably the finest actor of our days.The DVD is apparently dual-layer, and there is just the slightest pause when the player switches from one layer to the other.  The picture is expectedly sharp and the Dolby Digital 5.1 sound is just right most of the time.  However, some of the quieter conversations required doubling the volume (+3 dB)to get acceptable listening levels.All-in-all a great movie.  Unless you really don't like this kind of movie at all, see Nixon, the experience will be with you for a while. "},{"Title":"Excitement? Great Drama?

Stone is infamous for making films that bear little semblance to reality. He twists and distorts every single factual story and warps it into the way he wants reality to appear. Nixon is shot in a non-linear fashion and is utterly boring. There's nothing interesting nor is there anything that rivets you to your chair. Oliver Stone has done the same thing with his other films and what could you expect with a film about Nixon, the man he blames for Vietnam, even though Nixon had nothing to do with starting the war and in fact worked round the clock to bring an end to the war. Stone never sees the real picture. Don't waste your time.

He did have paranoid traits, was a politically devious individual but not anymore than any other politician of his day. In my opinion Richard Nixon was the greatest President the United States has seen and will ever see. He was a very strong individual and very influential. He basically put Eisenhower in the White House and denied other people from getting there. His portrayal in the film was very biased by Stone. Nixon was a great strategist, a loyal and dedicated American. Traits that should have been made. Had Kennedy not been shot and his affairs been publicly known, Kennedy would have been impeached too. Nixon got the U.S. out of Vietnam. Nixon's only err was panicking and trying to protect his loyal followers, which made the whole affair worse and caused him to resign the Presidency. This movie does not do justice to the man.

Nixon is as flat as a character can get.  Why does it take 3 hours to show that Nixon is a nervous sweaty, twitchy, manic.  To quote a review by Mick LaSalle, Stone presents a Nixon who couldn't have gotten Pat to vote for him.  The real Nixon was a powerful, driven man for much of his career.  He commanded an audience and delt with authority with Mao and the rest.  People supported him to their political death because he had a STRONG personality, despite his inability to charm women.  Of course his demons overtook him, but I would have liked to see a believable progression of his character.The film couldn't decide whether it was a documentary or a dramatization. Why were there fabricated newsreels of things that didn't happen?   Too much of the facts in the movie were speculation by Oliver Stone and I couldn't trust any of the movie.  Couldn't Oliver Stone find something better to do than flash bad camera angles at us.  Dark lighting, scratchy film, black and white, ... all of these are useful in their place, and Stone is good with them, but they were so overused in the movie as to make them pointless.  I don't need a strobe light flashing in my face, or choppy dialogue that doesn't quite fit the lips, to realize that the main character is loosing touch with reality.  (On my first point, was Nixon out of touch with reality from the beginning?)  I have a camcorder and I got bored playing with the black and white feature after the first week.  I wish Stone had gotten bored of his.The symbolism was overdone and too obvious.  Blood coming from Nixon's steak on the boat?  The movie was mysterious and ominous because of bad lighting and camera angles, not because of subtle dialogue and emotion.This movie could have been great.  Stone does a terrific job of portraying the demented side of Nixon.  If it were boiled to about 40 minutes and an hour of realistic portrayal of other aspects of Nixon's personality and life were added, it could have excelled.

Rather it's an episodic survey, but along the way are some interesting scenes and conversations. Anthony Hopkins is excellent, and in many places shows Nixon as a man of considerable depth and insight. Most other figures do not come across as clearly. Now that director Oliver Stone has done this movie, it would be great if he did an entire movie focusing on Watergate, one that tied everything together, from the Bay of Pigs onward, so that Watergate would receive a proper interpretation. This movie doesn't do this and that's disappointing. The tragedy of the man is tied up with Watergate but we don't understand it or his role with respect to it the way we can and should. If you are already heavily read on the subject or watched the entire set of hearings (as I did at the time), then the movie makes more sense than if you lack this context, because you can fit certain statements into the context that the movie doesn't present. You barely get a sense that Nixon's thinking about the break-in and what to do about it was on a vastly different level than his subordinates. You get no feel for Mitchell's having signed off on the plan, or Dean's subsequent role in it, or Nixon's entirely different take on it than those around him.

I have always liked Nixon; he had the same brusque manner of so many men born in the 1910-1920 period. Let's face it, the biggest US stories of the 20th century were the Depression, WWII, Korea, Cold War, Vietnam and the changes of US culture in the 60's and 70's and he was smack dab in the middle of all of them. I thought Anthony Hopkins looked and sounded like Nixon..his farewell speech (my mother was a Saint) which I love is so deep and profound and Hopkins knocks it out of the park. The very clever News of the World 5 minute political eulogy of 1962 you wont have Nixon to kick around summarizes his whole life to that point and the photo shopping of Hopkins into Nixon newsreel tells the whole story of 1946-60 in just a few minutes..a great way to tell the backstory . Oliver Stone must have a great deal of respect for Nixon as this is a very balanced film. Sorvino nailed Kissinger, and Powers Boothe was a good Haig. E.G.Marshall and Madeline Kahn(John/Martha Mitchell) were entertaining , and Ed Hermann as Rocky NY Governor was good too. These were very complicated times..Nixon grew up around horses and almost lived to the 21st century and it was all covered. The scene with Mao..maybe the most underrated event of the 20th century, was extremely well done and the gravitas filled the screen. It is now in my top 5 movies of all time..By the way, the music was outstanding(John Williams nominated for AA) and the ending credits are extremely moving. A great movie. "},{"Title":"A Film As Complex As Its Subject","Date":"2 May 2013","Score":"","Genre":"Biography, Drama, History","Review":" (Note This review is based on the 2008 Election Year Edition DVD)Oliver Stone's 1995 film Nixon is something of an oddity. Released on the back of Stone's success with JFK and Natural Born Killers, it was largely praised by critics yet was all but ignored by audiences. Nearly twenty years later, the film stands up though as one of Stone's best films and presents an intriguing portrait of one of the most controversial men to occupy the Oval Office Richard Milhous Nixon.Anthony Hopkins performance as Nixon is the heart and soul of the film. While Hopkins may not have done Nixon's voice or bare the greatest resemblance to him, he is nevertheless compelling in the role. Hopkins does that by capturing the many varying and often contradictory qualities of Nixon as the film moves back and forth through time from 1960 to 1974 and the year's in-between. There are moments of introspection, moments where's purely unlikeable (such as the dinner scene between Nixon and Pat late in the film) and yet moments where he is all too human. What Hopkins and the film succeed in doing is making Nixon not a caricature, but a human being and the film ultimately works as a result.The rest of the cast is strong as well. Paul Sorvino makes for an excellent and utterly convincing Henry Kissinger and, like Hopkins, rises up the caricatures to create a full-fledged character. Joan Allen's performance from Pat Nixon is interesting to watch as the relationship between her and Nixon develops and leads to some of the film's best scenes (such as the aforementioned dinner scene). There are also strong performances from James Woods, J. T. Walsh, David Hyde Pierce, Powers Boothe, Bob Hoskins, Sam Waterston (who only appears in the director's cut and steals the show for the space of his lengthy scene as CIA director Richard Helms) and Mary Steenburgen amongst others in the large cast. Like Stone's JFK, the film works in large part due to the strength of its cast.The film's production values are strong well. The film's recreations of the Nixon White House are stunning both to look at it and in their historical accuracy. The production design also does fine work creating the various settings of the film ranging from where Nixon grew up to a TV studio where one of the 1960 television debates took place to Air Force One and the presidential yacht. There's also a sparse but well done score from John Williams which also incorporates some good source music, including quoting Williams' own score for JFK at one point. What doesn't work as well is a newsreel sequence set after Nixon's 1962 defeat when he ran for governor of California due to some crude and even laughable pasting of Hopkins face into archival images and footage but that it is just about forgivable in light of the rest of the film.Looking at the film itself, it's easy to see why it failed to find a larger audience. Nixon takes the leaps in time seen in JFK (which itself was arguably a murder mystery on a fundamental level) to new levels as the film begins on the brink of the infamous 1972 Watergate break in, jumps forward to November 1973 and then proceeds to engage in a series of flashbacks (often within another flashback) as well as leaping forwards in time as it heads to the Presidential resignation in August 1974. The film also takes on a surreal and, at times, hallucinatory air such as bomb's exploding behind Nixon during a visit to the Lincoln Memorial, an odd tunnel effect used during his pneumonia episode or his mother's ghost appearing during one scene. The results can be hard to follow at times but the result is a rewarding one if the viewer sticks with it.The reason is that the film, largely through its script and Hopkins' Nixon, presents a fascinating portrait of a man and his times. The film shows a man who was in many ways admirable yet could be distant, cocky, ruthless, self-pitying, and paranoid who seemed to always be unsure of himself. Ultimately, Nixon as a film is a tragedy, the story of a man who causes his own downfall as a result of letting his personal demons overrule his better nature. While the film has been criticized for its historical accuracy (though the extensive footnotes in the published screenplay goes a long way to refute that), it nevertheless presents a fascinating was and perhaps even truthful image of a man who rarely if ever showed his true face.Nixon then is an intriguing film filled with strong performances, strong production values and a script that paints a fascinating image of a controversial figure. Yet in the way it's told, it is a film that can be long winded, leaps around decades of history and can be oddly surreal at times. As a result, Oliver Stone has created a film that is every bit as complex as its subject matter and, quite possibly, made all the better for it. "},{"Title":"There Never Was Any... Peace at the Center","Date":"18 April 2013","Score":"","Genre":"Biography, Drama, History","Review":" The most alienating of Presidents Nixon did very little to be the Leader of America. He steadfastly and without hesitation, apology, or even a slight understanding of what was dividing the Country, was a classic egocentric. His way was the only way and the only way you were going to be a bona-fide Citizen of His Nation was to follow him or get out (love it or leave it...remember that?).That may be a tough and simplistic analysis of a complex Political Figure but it is in the opinion of many, True. The Film displays this as Fact and it is probably not too far off. Here we see a consistently troubled (even in pre-Watergate times and Childhood) Personality that was most likely doomed the minute he became dependent on the Public for success.This is a mesmerizing and dazzling Picture with all the Oliver Stone touches. The familiar Stylist flourishes with abandon and Pride as he presents a Biography ultra-dramatized for effect and intent. It sweeps like a vacuum and not a broom as it powerfully draws in and upon a large amount of unsettling History and Psychological diagnosis.Overall, it is compelling and interesting, riveting and revolting, as we watch a National Figure lose his soul, as quoted at the beginning of the Movie, and it is not a fun thing to observe. This is a forever dark and brooding affair much like the title Character. For it seems, for the most part, Richard Nixon was more like a Characterization of a Person than a Person, both here on screen and in Real Life. The Human Nixon always seemed to be in noncompliance with the Third-Person Nixon that he liked to refer to.

That is pretty much dead on. JFK is Oliver's best all around work where he turns what could be a dense 3 hour film into what feels like a 2 hour journey. Nixon although 3 1/2 hours feels like a long film it is also a more complex film. Oliver even uses parts of the JFK score.Like Godfather, Nixon is the continuation of the JFK story with the aftermath of his death and its affect on the country. An affect that leads to his chief rival becoming the leader of the United States of America. Many would argue the story is all about Nixon which is somewhat true, but the beauty of this film it has many themes. It can be seen as the story of the fall, rise and greater fall of one of the most infamous Presidents of the Modern era or the story of what happens to a man who is trapped in a system and his own paranoia. There are a lot of themes being played here and while at its heart is the Nixon story there are a lot of elements in play for various interpretations.Hopkin's Nixon is probably his best work this side of Silence of the Lambs. Everyone gives A+ performances from Joan Allen to James Woods to Hayden Pierce. The cinematography is amazing as per usual with Oliver Stone. While people complain the various camera moves, I find it refreshing since even out of focus it still looks more clear than the films of today including the Bourne franchise, Michael Bay and other action films of our time. I do believe the reason for this film not doing while at the box office is a combination of Oliver Stone conspiracy fatigue with a combination of a 3 hour film run on a person most people despise. Even I did not see it in theaters which was a mistake. This maybe one of the best works of the 90s and probably one of the better bio pics out there. Even if you don't like the conspiracy theories which there are a few winks and nods, you should give this film a look. I would also find it impossible for Oliver to be criticized for adding conspiracies in a film that deals with the greatest cover-up and exposure of said cover-up of all time. But, I doubt those people saw this film anyway, Hee-Haw must have been on or something.

Hopkins too, great as he is, seems like he's straining to keep the Nixon face and voice on constantly. Overall - it's a flawed but powerful bio-pic.

The Richard Nixon portrayed in Stone's Nixon was in reality and in the film a two-time winner in the race for U.S. President. And during his second bid, Nixon was deeply involved in a spy mission known as Watergate. Some of the things that made me feel sympathy were His constant harping on the past, his own past as a son of Quakers, which he was proud up---that point was made again and again in the movie. Nixon talked about Roosevelt a lot, saw him as a hero. Roosevelt was elected in 1901, and I did not know that McKinley was assassinated. Another quality of Nixon(as portrayed in this film), was that he hated the Kennedys, but for non-political reasons. The Kennedys were like a popular party. Nixon talked about John and Teddy Kennedys media darling halo. A lot of people did not like Nixon, through Stone's eyes or did not understand him, thinking on the latter lines that Nixon was a fruitcake, or a nut case. In the movie Nixon was taking a lot of medications...this relates directly back to his brother Harold and another brother Arthur dying of tuberculosis. So Richard may have been a candidate for the same illness. Whether Nixon medicated himself with other drugs is not clear. He drank at the White House..I think everyone drank. It is definitely true that Nixon had a dark side..very much so toward his wife Buddy. The film makes Nixon out obviously to be the manipulator in the Ellsberg plan, but the obvious masterminds were Hunt, Liddy and..Erlichmann? Probably Ehrlichmann, too. A lot of Nixon's staff knew about the bugging. What it amounts to in Hollywood cinema terms anyway is that, who wants to go to see a movie about a golden boy? There is not enough material for an interesting story. The movie is intensively interesting to me, and I wonder if that is because I am not ultra-extremist. The terrible acts of people like Mark David Chapman and Timothy McVeigh shows the direction we are going in. Further than the assassinations of the '60s. Anyway, Nixon got the nod after JFK was erased, and Nixon through his idiosyncratic charm took the bull by the horns. He was going to win the office anyway. Pat was obviously happy. She was a tough one to figure. Because she at one time showed wishes that Richard would quit politics. But she could see clear to the presidency for her husband. Later, when the chips were down, and Nixon was being criticized for Cambodia, the job Pat Nixon's husband held was reflecting back at her a lot. For anyone who missed the show, there were some embarrassing moments in Nixon's early career. The contest against Mondale however, was not one of those moments. Moving toward the presidency, Nixon's platform was one of the power and the glory in his speeches, when he gave his speeches. I believe that was the 60's.

The directing style is brilliant, although has some rough patches that could've been smoothed over. Anthony Hopkins approach to the role should be an example for every actor starring in a biopic. He doesn't try to impersonate Nixon. He represents Richard Nixon, which makes it a more convincing performance. You completely forget you're watching a film, instead a docudrama because Sir Anthony Hopkins is *that* good. Joan Allen should've been locked for the acting trophy for Best Supporting Actress 30 minutes into the first screening of the film in '95. One of the earlier scenes between she and her husband is uncanny. She brings to life the bitterness Pat Nixon went through. Though, the acting would seem like the highlight of this powerful biopic, it's the editing, in my opinion. They piece together Richard Nixon's entire life, literally his entire life. And they shot frame by frame almost everything here, so the majority of the responsibility belonged to the editor, who brought authenticity to every single moment here. There are some problems though. First, some of the political drama is hard to follow unless you know what you're talking about. Especially to mainstream audiences, it would be confusing. Second, the only film I condone for being 3 hours long is Titanic. There is no reason why this, or any film needs to strain audiences for three hours. You feel like you're watching a miniseries. Just say what you want to say and be done with it. That being said, Oliver Stone hits more than he misses, a lot more. It's near perfection; 9.

In fact for a man who viewed politics as a bloodsport in his life Nixon gets a surprisingly sympathetic treatment from Oliver Stone not someone I thought would give him one.The Nixon we see is the poor kid who scrapped for everything he gained in his lifetime and saw himself constantly in a battle against the elites who had it handed to them. In his own party Nelson Rockefeller symbolized that and in the Democrats Nixon came up against the Kennedy family. Anthony Hopkins really got a good grasp of the character, I'd be curious to hear what kind of research Hopkins did to prepare for the part.Though Nixon the film got four Academy Award nominations, one of them wasn't for editing which I think is the best overall feature of the film. Oliver Stone did a great job in mixing both color and black and white newsreel footage in with the body of the film. So a lot of the historical figures of Nixon's time make cameo appearances in the film.Nixon constantly needed reassuring and he got it wherever he could, be it from wife Pat played here by Joan Allen or from a carefully chosen group of sycophants who made up the White House staff of his Presidency. Some of their names have come down to us in history through the Watergate break-in scandal that brought Nixon down. James Woods is great as Bob Haldeman the White House chief of staff, an opportunist of the first order who when Nixon needed someone to tell him to back off was there to throw gasoline on the fire. Even his very looks when Woods has no dialog show this self satisfied smugness of a man whose reached the top by attaching himself to a person of power.Another portrayal that is worthy of mention is that of Mary Steenburgen who was described both by her husband and her most famous son as a saint. She's seen in flashback with her children imparting certain moral lessons, but in the case of son Richard giving him an inflexible self righteousness that justifies some really low political actions all in the promoting of the career of Nixon.Nixon got four Oscar nominations for Anthony Hopkins as Best Actor, for Joan Allen as Best Supporting Actress, for Best Original Screenplay and for Best Musical Score. Sad it did not take home a winner in any of these categories.Nixon will stand the test of time as a fine piece cinema drama about a complex man and the times he lived in.

Marshall, Madeline Kahn and David Paymer. The film tells the story of Nixon from his childhood in Whittier, California, with a very religious Quaker mother (Mary Steenburgen), a tough father (Tom Bower) and his brothers, two of whom would die young. The film continues with Nixon's rise to power as a Congressman, his great success with the Alger Hiss case, his Senate win, his vice-presidency, his loss of the 1960 Presidential election and later the bid to be Governor of California, and rising like a phoenix from the ashes to become President in 1968 and be elected for a second term by a phenomenal landslide. And Watergate. And resignation.Oliver Stone is a director who is known to play footsie with the truth, so one can only guess at the veracity of the depiction of Nixon's uneasy relationship with his wife (Joan Allen). Some of the White House scenes, I'm assuming, were adapted from the now famous (or should I say infamous) tapes that Nixon fought so fiercely to keep from going public. The scene with Kissinger where Nixon asks Kissinger to pray with him is described in detail by Kissinger in print and is accurate. It's one of the saddest scenes in the film.Stone gives us the portrait of a man with self-esteem so low that, in order to be near Pat when he first met her, he drove her and her boyfriends on their dates because he had a car and the guys didn't. He considered himself an outsider everywhere he went; he compared himself unfavorably to Kennedy and thought reporters hated him because he hadn't gone to the right schools and grew up poor. His self-loathing made him paranoid, hate just about everyone else and play dirty to get what he wanted. As the White House transcripts show, he had nothing but contempt for artists, blacks, Jews and gays. There is no mention in the film of his complete ruination of Helen Gahagan Douglas, actor Melvyn Douglas' wife, by labeling her a Communist when he ran against her for the Senate in 1950. He set the cause of women in politics back a good 30 years and destroyed the career of an intelligent, capable human being.As hateful as Nixon was, and he was pretty hateful, Stone nevertheless attempts to give us a well-rounded and somewhat sympathetic portrait. Had it been anyone else, it might have worked. Anyone who lived during the time of Watergate and Vietnam has a hard time buying Nixon as a victim of circumstance.I sat in a bedroom on Pinckney Street in Boston with my best friend and watched Nixon resign in 1974. I can remember that at the time, we laughed because he made very little sense. From the window, we could hear the cheers coming from Boston Commons. Thirty-four years later, my same best friend and I, now 3000 miles away, watched the re-enactment of the resignation in Nixon, and it was no longer funny. Nixon was indeed a pathetic person, and Anthony Hopkins captures him magnificently, his discomfort in certain situations, his resentments, his fears. A brilliant, complex portrait. Joan Allen is excellent as Pat Nixon, a devoted wife and a very unhappy woman. The President's Men are all well acted, and Paul Sorvino as Kissinger is remarkable and almost unrecognizable.Part of Nixon's problem was a generational one - men of his era, and even the era following, did not seek help to work out their problems. They carried their childhood hurts and baggage with them throughout their lives and never got past any of it.I heard Nixon speak in the 1980s, and he was absolutely fantastic. Funny, insightful, compelling, with great timing, he gave an excellent speech to an appreciative audience. Another time, I heard a tape recording of an interview with him. After the interview, he began to speak with a reporter he knew personally. The reporter was very respectful, and Nixon was very human and very friendly. Probably by the time of these two incidents, he had at last made some peace with himself.Oliver Stone is a controversial director, but I like the detail of his films, his follow-through of a story and the questions that often arise as a result of viewing one of them. In Nixon, he chose a man who participated in two very dark times in America's history - the Communist witch hunts and Watergate, and he has made an excellent and absorbing film chronicling the man and his times.Nixon made phrases like off the record and expletive deleted part of the lingo. He made the careers of Woodward and Bernstein and because of him, many of his associates got big fat book deals, acting jobs, and jail sentences. Nixon thought that opening China and bombing the hell out of Vietnam and Cambodia should make up for the President of the United States becoming a felon. He was wrong, as he was about so many other things.

It portrays Richard Nixon as a pretty decent human being where his family is concerned. Richard doesn't play around on his wife, he's a good dad to his kids, loves his mother. Politically, he's an effective schemer and an aggressive campaigner. Some things are left unanswered or unsaid we don't get the monster impression held dearly by liberals, no murders, no maimings, etc. We do see a politician who has few friends but has a nation conclude that he's the only guy around willing and able to pull us out of the decay and violence brought on by the inept liberal establishment that made us feel guilty for being white, protestant and prosperous. Unfortunately, Nixon is shown in high-relief, disappointed that America refuses to turn him into a counterfeit-Christ, like they did JFK, and disappointed that the Press doesn't adore him, like they did JFK. Moreover, the film reveals what we all know about politicians today they crave the love that their flawed personalities can't get from normal human relations; they crave the power to manipulate the ordinary man, because they know what's best for the hoi polloi; they crave the approval of landslide electoral wins; they sacrifice their health, intellect and time on the altar of the government in order to get adulation and approval from the people; and the germ of dictator is never far from the surface. Hillary, George W, Kucinich, McKane, Carter, they're all like that.

It starts of rather chaotically, with flashbacks, black&white to color transforms and back, and indeed this MTV-type filming (or perhaps more accurately, this type of filming is very similar to that used in JFK and Natural Born Killers, other films by Oliver Stone) continues more or less intense throughout the film. Flashbacks can be a very good thing in films, but in this case the flashbacks are more often than not too short or too chaotic to make any sense.However, this movie is definitely saved by very strong acting performance across the field and has in general good production values.I especially liked the remarkable performance of Anthony Hopkins in portraying Nixon as a moody, somber and increasingly bitter and paranoid President, a performance almost in complete opposite of his performance as a cool and reserved butler in 'Remains of the Day'. This is a 3 hour long movie and, unfortunately, the weakest bit comes after about 40 to 50 minutes in the movie, when we try to follow some of Nixon's early years. These scenes don't really shine, not because of acting, but because of lack of depth. The scenes rely on a sort of atmospheric impressionism that really isn't there. Instead Stone confused 'style' too much with 'slow paced' here.However, the actual story is very good in portraying Nixon both as a man, with all his flaws and moods, and as a politician. It doesn't hold back, so at the same time we see the man as both ambitious, conniving, and criminal on the one hand, and his desire to be loved and be popular, to be understood, to perform as a president on the other.In conclusion, I'd say this would have been a great film if not for lackluster childhood scenes (again, not because of lack of acting). However this film is worth an 8 to me and I would recommend it as a good way to spend an evening.

The film delves deeply into his personal background- his many ordeals, ranging from the childhood turmoil and devastation of the death of his brother, to his anxieties and tensions on the campaign seeking the presidency with many disappointments, and finally to his trials and frustrations as President of the United States. Some of the film's detractors will derail this very curious film as being overly long, overly factual, and overly personal, and while Nixon certainly does delve into much of the realms of the man and his many environments, there are many important aspects to Nixon's life and careers which are almost entirely spared concentration here, including his experiences as a Navy serviceman in World War II, notorious career in the House UnAmerican Activities Committee, illustrious, experienced position as Vice President for eight years under Eisenhower, and even his twenty years of living proceeding his notorious departure from office in 1974; these details are almost entirely neglected, and perhaps should have been addressed moreso than say, Nixon's personal details, because such details really matter in making a case about who Nixon really was. Besides the negligence of these details, this is a film that boldly and critically implores many personal and professional matters of Richard Nixon, and really succeeds in giving the viewer a concise idea of his character and demeanor toward his many affairs. Anthony Hopkins delivers, in my opinion, the most brilliant, convincing, and effective performance of his career, in portraying Richard Nixon expertly and understandably, from his disgruntled facial features to his intense vigor and temerity toward his surroundings and aspirations, and really deserves commendation for perfecting such a difficult and bewildering character as Nixon, the man whom nobody really knew. Joan Allen is prominent and compassionate as Patricia Nixon (A.K.A. Buddy, in Nixon's reference), whom, as we learn here, is both caring and acceptable of her husband, yet honest and critical of his doings. The well-documented, vivid direction of Oliver Stone is ingenious and extremely economical in focusing on various themes and reflections throughout the film, and one can conclude that Stone is very curious and understanding about practically every matter he addresses here, from narrowing in on Nixon's conscience to revolving around his demons and frustrating environments. We really learn a lot about Nixon's personal background and the roots to his notorious petulance and tenacity, for better or for worse, from some study of his critical decisions in the White House (e.g. being the only American President to ever cease to a lost war-Vietnam) to his affection to the cancer of his Presidency, the Watergate Scandal, which ultimately undid Nixon's noble legacy to the shambles of political scandal. What a sympathetic and personal look Nixon provides to this fascinating, troubled, bewildering, and misunderstood figure, and what an extraordinary life he truly led, his fame,fortune and plight much accounted by simply destiny, and also much accounted by personal inclination and dedication; Nixon was truly a remarkable figure who has had a profound effect on American and international history. Nixon is an extremely well-documented, if not entirely concise, and extremely graphic study of Richard Milhous Nixon, practically perfected in film-making by the ingenious examination and curiosity of Oliver Stone, and the brilliant conviction of Anthony Hopkins, and this is one truly fascinating insight into the life of a truly fascinating, conflicted, misunderstood, important figure. ***1/2 out of **** "},{"Title":"Not for the Kiddies","Date":"6 June 2004","Score":"","Genre":"Biography, Drama, History","Review":"  Although the title of this review may falsely imply that this is a one-stop gorefest of a film, anyone who would just look at the title of the film would realize that the movie takes on more of a biographical undertone. And who better to provide us with a 3-hour+ epic with limited historical credibility than Oliver Stone?I must say immediately that I am a huge Oliver Stone fan, mainly impressed with the range of direction appearing in his films and his tendency to take film-making to an extreme. Along with JFK, which unlike this film is not a biographical account of a past president, Nixon takes the viewer on a ride which causes him to ponder, is this true? Did it really happen this way? Although thorough in character development and powerful in delivery, this is not meant to be a documentary so to speak. If anything, it is sort of a subjective adaptation of events that took place; a dramatization.The reason I say this film is not for children, is the level of its plot. Basically, you would have to had taken several college-level American history courses to even grasp some of the names and events mentioned by the actors in the first 20 minutes of the film to understand it.Nixon, for whatever else it may represent, is a tale of a president who felt he was never beloved by the people, and who always feared the long-looming shadow of his predecessor JFK. It describes the trials and tribulations of a man disjointed with the public, yet still pure at heart.The main focus of the film is on the notoriety of the Watergate Scandal, with the rest of the movie setting up the motive and the circumstances under which it took place. Nixon (played brilliantly by Academy Award winner Anthony Hopkins) spends most of the movie sheltered by his cabinet and chiefs of staff in discussing various conspiracy issues that occurred in the 60s and 70s.Where this film truly blossoms, and where it earned a rare 5-star rating from me, was in its dynamics. Sure, 191min is a long movie (with the director's cut tallying an even greater 212min), but the film is brilliantly filled with Oliver Stone-esquire flashbacks to old newsreel footage and supposed earlier points in the character's lives. To mention the fate of all the characters would be futile in that there are so many key roles. Look for appearances by James Woods, Joan Allen, J.T. Walsh, Dan Hedaya, David Hyde Pierce... among others.I cannot wait for Stone's next attempt at a president, with the title being Clinton.  "},{"Title":"Yeah, He's Nixon","Date":"4 December 2003","Score":"","Genre":"Biography, Drama, History","Review":" Some would argue that Anthony Hopkins is one of the greatest actors of our generation. I am not one of them. To me, he brings a weary, defeated, and depressed vibe to every role he plays. This works well in some films (The Remains Of The Day, Silence Of The Lambs) and backfires in many others (The Human Stain, ANY attempt at comedy). When I heard that Oliver Stone would be making a film about Richard Nixon, I had high hopes. Watching the film, however, I am sure that Mr. Hopkins was the wrong actor for the lead.Oliver Stone's Nixon attempts to tragedize the rise and fall of one of America's most controversial presidents, and not being an expert on Richard Nixon, I expected to learn a lot about him; his motivations, both personal and political, that drove him to do the things he did. But what we're left with is a frenetic newsreel, a glorified made-for-TV dramatized documentary. (Bear in mind that I think Oliver Stone is a GREAT director, and that The Doors is one of the most underrated films of the 90's.) We never find Nixon's heart or soul, and while I cannot blame Hopkins completely for this, it doesn't help that he plays him as a disoriented, mumbling stumbling robot who speaks in a barely-concealed Welsh accent. This was a role for an American actor, pure and simple.While the supporting cast is top-rate (including the always-brilliant James Woods), they have little to do except circle around Nixon until the inevitable. Stone tries to portray Nixon as a great but flawed man, but the undeniable image we are left with is simply a weak-willed politician for whom winning is more important than anything else (SEE Bill Clinton).Nixon wasn't the man behind the Kennedy assassination, the Bay of Pigs debacle, the Vietnam War, or any of the other government-sponsored disasters of the 1960's. He, like Lee Harvey Oswald, was really just a patsy... a puppet used by the real men in power to stoke their war and take America away from the people.

It is made to appear that otherwise he would not make it as a president. Also he appeared ruthless, corrupted, (at a scene he was seen with a hooker) war-phile (presidents can bomb who ever they want) and absolutely mad at times.Even though these two above mentioned profiles could co-exist in one person, still the sense of contradiction was with me throughout the movie; this is not to say that I did not like nor would not recommend it as it can make a good discussion topic after.Finally Hopkins was brilliant as ever.

However, as much as his films have a documentary feel they are also artistic in their expression of characters and ideas in history. 'Nixon', his biography of enigmatic and criticized late president Richard M. Nixon is a gripping, stunning, powerful film that never fails to release the audience from its grasp.Told in what seems to be an almost nonlinear time sequence, 'Nixon' chronicles the life and times of the president from his childhood to his resignation. As a 12 year old, Nixon (Corey Carrier) lived a life of hardship along with his brother Harold (Tony Goldwyn) in a quiet California town. His dad, Frank (Tom Bower) is a tough, somewhat mean spirited man who believes in hard work and struggle. His mother, Hannah (Mary Steenburgen) a very religious but sweet woman who tries to steer Richard to the best path possible. There are several scenes that show Nixon's childhood, and how his parents and the untimely death of Harold cause him trauma at a young age and eventually shaped his willpower to work hard and get somewhere since he had the opportunity.Nixon as an adult is played by Anthony Hopkins, with such a furious velocity and chameleon like ability it seems that he has completely lost himself in this role, giving it 110% and perhaps this being the greatest male performance in cinematic history. His expressions, his mannerisms are all down to a T. Nixon's tough but loving wife Pat (Joan Allen) is also played superbly by fine actress Allen. These performances dominate the screen as Nixon rises to success, even after failure in the 1960 election against Kennedy, and a failed bid as California governor. He swears to leave politics, much to the disappointment of his campaign managers but in 1968 when the doors swing open once again, he runs for president and wins. The war in Vietnam seems to chew up his career as more and more protest the war. He tries to negotiate with the director of CIA (Sam Waterston) through his adviser Haldeman (James Woods). He seems to be politically somewhat steady, and wins reelection in 1972 but soon failed bombing runs in Cambodia along with the Watergate scandal threaten to ruin his presidency. Young John Dean (David Hyde Pierce) tries to set up a deal with the leader of the Watergate scandal, Howard Hunt (Ed Harris) but soon he himself gets involved in the situation. Also playing critical roles in Nixon's presidency are twisted head of FBI J. Edgar Hoover (Bob Hoskins) and a confused but somewhat of a friend Henry Kissinger (Paul Sorvino). While this plot seems complicated, it all connects in the film, which is almost epic in stature.Gripping political films are hard to come by. Either they are engulfed in bias or are sheer boredom, but 'Nixon' manages to counter both of these factors. Through their intelligent screenplay Stephen J. Rivele, Christopher Wilkinson, and Oliver Stone masterfully craft this story of receipt and treachery. Individual scenes are powerful, and often display true gut. Nixon is obviously a complicated man but the script is focused enough to develop him as a tortured human being who was trying to do the right thing but was ultimately chewed up by Watergate(The lie always gets you). Stone as a director is able to assemble a great ensemble and masterfully direct individual scenes and the film as a whole, developing the situation more and more and making it all come together. He masterfully achieves the feel of the era and creates a great film in the process.'Nixon' clocks at more than three hours, but it is well worth it. Experiencing the power of Hopkins' performance is beyond words, and the rest of the cast also turns in great work. A masterful political film, and one of great filmmaker Oliver Stone's best works, right after 'JFK'.10/10 "},{"Title":"Hopkins Was Good But.....","Date":"9 June 2003","Score":"","Genre":"Biography, Drama, History","Review":"  Although Anthony Hopkins does his usual outstanding job, if you want to see a downright eerie portrayal of the Ex-President check out 1989's The Final Days.

I can't quite believe that there was quite so much alcohol use on the job at the White House and on the campaigns as is shown.

I do not think President Nixon was ever a media figure. What would he think about cellphone and internet messaging and all the rest? Having to vote or create national budgets, including computer systems during the fifties and sixties what would he think about emoticons or HTML?  What did he know about Fortran (used in NASA) and when did he know it?  Interesting maybe.When I read President Nixon's writing he does political essays very well. Henry Kissinger who also does political writing very well worked in the Nixon White House.  I was able to borrow from a local library David McCullough's post presidential interview with the Ex-President.  PBS 1991.I think Oliver Stone's director's touch shows that he creates good movies.

Likewise, the famous accomodation with China and the meeting with Mao is well handled and acknowledged.But its the last hour of the film that really shocks and scares you. Its well documented now that Nixon under pressure sought relief in the bottle and pills, and his always nervous and anxious personality gave way to outright paranoia and instability.

Bill Clinton, on the other hand, continued to deny right to the end of his presidency that he was not the scumball he truly was.  Two British actors really shine in this movie.

After his paean to JFK in the film of the same name, Stone turns his critical lens to Richard M. Nixon, a less celebrated president to say the least. While a reassessment of Nixon has been in the works for some time, based in great part on his China policy, you'd be forgiven for expecting vitriol from a filmmaker who has confessed to dreaming of killing Nixon with his own hands earlier in life.What you get is a surprisingly fair and sympathetic exploration of a character. I emphasize this because Stone and co are not concerned with mimicking the awkward historical figure of drawing a rich character we can observe and judge with a fresh perspective. Anthony Hopkins does not look much like the disgraced American President, but he becomes him, and invites much more empathy than the real deal ever could.The virtuoso turn in the central performance is crucial to this film, complex and potentially confusing as is unless you are very familiar with recent American history and the Watergate scandal in particular. Stone uses his jumpy structure to pick Nixon apart piece by piece, willingly forsaking clarity at the benefit of emotion and character development, and the result might well be one of the finest, most audacious biographical films ever made.Hopkins does the heavy lifting, as is supported by expert work from Joan Allen as Pat Nixon, James Woods as a shifty chief of staff, and Paul Sorvino as a dead ringer for Henry Kissinger, another controversial figure. Cinematographer Robert Richardson's almost random shifting of film-stocks throughout jars at first but serves to underline the fragmentary, often self-contradictory nature of a fascinating central character.Nixon might well be Stone's most mature and honest film.

Despite his sometimes overzealous theories and camera movements, Stone rightly sees Nixon (as acted out by Anthony Hopkins) as a man of tremendous political intellect at a time of extreme social turbulence in American history.Stone is very even-handed in his portrait of the man.  Richard Nixon was a man of considerable political gifts, able to split the Sino-Russian communist bloc in two without causing a revolt among his right-wing supporters and sign the all-important ABM treaty with Russia that lessened nuclear tensions for decades to come.  Unfortunately, those political gifts were marred by a certain extreme paranoia that led to Watergate and his downfall.  Nobody should have expected Stone to gloss over those, and he doesn't.  What he DOES do, however, is show how Nixon became the American personification of a Greek tragic figure, which makes NIXON a compelling and very watchable movie, conspiracy theories and numerous story fabrications aside.The case Stone has assembled for NIXON is very much like the one he got for JFK--distinguished and brilliant.  Joan Allen is excellent as Pat Nixon (and was deserving of the Supporting Actress Oscar nod).  James Woods, Powers Boothe, J.T. Walsh, Bob Hoskins, David Hyde Pierce, and Ed Harris all contribute equally sterling and cutting performances.  Out of ten stars, I give this 8--docking two points for the fabrications.

Towards the end it seems Nixon is a total wreck. There are powerful moments in the film, and endearing ones as well. There are things I didn't know about Nixon that came as a shock in this film, both personal things and presidential things (then again, Stone does include a disclaimer at the beginning warning us all that everything in the movie might not really have happened).

Like JFK, Nixon is a film that is long but never boring, always intriguing, and one that shows sides of people (particularly Pat Nixon) and events that for most of us have always been shrouded in mystery. (Nixon's strange upbringing is especially well-presented by Stone, even if it probably lacks some historical authority.)Nevertheless, I cannot recommend Nixon, mostly because the characterization of the President seemed to me to ring just a bit untrue. Much has been said about how Anthony Hopkins so skillfully portrayed Nixon as a deeply insecure man plagued by his own personal demons. This he surely was. He was also a man with not-terribly well-developed people skills, and was no stranger to occasional public humiliation. But Hopkins's Nixon seemed so *constantly* nervous, jerky, sweaty, and generally terrified of everything around him that I could not imagine such a man gaining support from people who had actually had contact with him. As I watched scene after scene of Nixon interacting with people, I wondered whether, after he had left a room, the other characters considered sending for the paramedics to help the poor, unbalanced, and dangerously hypertense man who had just left their midst.The real Nixon, one must remember, was well-versed in public debate and was the veteran of many a political campaign. Yes, there was the blatant hollowness of Checkers. Yes, there was the deeply embarrassing press conference of 1962. But if you see, for instance, his comeback appearance on the Jack Paar Show, you see a cool, confident Nixon, one who seemed ready to take on any challenge. He was also not so completely unappealing publicly that he could not gain over 49 percent of the vote in 1960. Moreover, his real-life aides were extremely loyal to him, mostly because they believed in him strongly, though in the film  they nearly always seem to think they are in the presence of a ticking time bomb. I suppose it would have been better to see a more well-rounded view of Nixon, both the deeply disturbed and paranoid fellow who pushed people and success away with equal energy, and the occasionally well-spoken, cleverly sinister Nixon with the big grin. The end of the first half does show a rousing speech given by Nixon at the 68 convention, but by that time, I think, the damage has already been done, and the point continues to be hammered in the second half.No, I don`t think Stone could have made Nixon likeable, but he, and Hopkins, did make him into a frightening caricature rather than a frightening man.

Nixon walks the tightrope between a by-the-books historical docudrama and a director's own opinion of a President who ended the war in Southeast Asia, who made peace with both China and the Soviet Union, and who was somehow brought down by a third-rate burglary (not to mention illegally bombing Cambodia, lying to the American public, defying popular opinion to end the war, taping every conversation in the White House, hating the Kennedys, etc.). What makes this film better than most of the attempts to document a major American public figure on the big screen is the incredible performances by the entire cast. Anthony Hopkins, who just four years earlier was Hannibal Lector, completely transformed himself into Nixon. It was his performance of a lifetime and it should have won him the Academy Award. The supporting cast is great, especially Paul Sorvino as Henry Kissinger, James Woods as H.R. Haldeman, J.T. Walsh as John Ehrlichman, David Hyde-Pierce as John Dean, and Powers Boothe as Alexander Haig. Even minor roles by George Plimpton, Larry Hagman, Bob Hoskins and others are excellent. This movie allows Americans who grew up in the post-Nixon era to understand what Watergate was all about. More compelling than All The President's Men, it really is the story of the man and not his presidency. Stone plays up Nixon's insecurities but what the audience should walk away with is a portrait of a man who's own worst enemy was himself. Numerous comments by the supporting cast throughout the film, particularly those by Kissinger and Ehrlichman, back up this idea. In no way is Stone trying to defend Nixon but his film is actually sympathetic towards the man. Whether you liked Nixon or not, under all of the layers, his heart was in the right place. Unfortunately, he chose to betray the confidence that the American people had entrusted in him and that is why he will never, even posthumously, escape the humiliation of taking the fall for three decades of mistakes that seriously damaged the international reputation of the United States. I give this film the highest recommendation, not only as a convenient way to begin to understand thirty years of social upheaval, but as a movie that stands on its own as a celebration of American culture. Love him or hate him, Nixon defined an era in American history in which the United States was forced to re-examine itself before it could re-examine the rest of the world.

Whether he's actually playing Richard Nixon is up for grabs, but none the less he gives a spell-binding performance for whoever the hell he's playing. The supporting cast was stronger than most films I've ever seen, and like most Stone films, they're all A-list actors.This film would have fallen apart in the hands of a less weathered director, but Stone handles it with such professionalism. His camera work, flash forwards, flashbacks all made this film much more watchable.Another thing he does here is something that no other film or other kind of political propaganda has ever done. He humanizes a man who was hated by a country. A man, who in my politically ignorant generation, was considered the worst president ever to grace the White House. While all of this film may not be historically accurate, take it as a fascinating work of fiction. The characters are absorbing, and the plot is unusually easy to follow for those too young to remember these events.This film is one long haul but worth it in the end.  While the events may be a little (or a lot) off the facts, it's still a great story about a man who had greatness within his grasp.   A story about a man who worked hard his whole life to have everything taken away from him.  It's a story about social and political class.  This film is easily in context comparable to Citizen Kane, or even to a lesser extent, Taxi Driver (the character study portion).

Nixon as man. A tragic figure in the Classical Greek tradition. One who inspires both horror and pathos. A man who was never satisfied because he never found completeness. A man who would pity himself after he was caught using others to fulfill his need to achieve. He reminds me of Bart Simpson's idea of OJ Simpson. Sure, I'm covered in their blood but, why are you picking on me? Go look for the real killers. Nixon's tragedy was that he could never stop being NixoniN; he was the enemy he was certain was all around him. He'd tell the blue collar worker, the so called Reagan-Democrats, he was one of them while he worked to crush their power base and influance. They say ambition is its own punishment. Nixon shows us that. Without understanding power is cruelty unashamed, without humor ambition is repression, without caring life is self destructive. Those who live south of America's Manson-Nixon Line will always excuse Nixon's every action and will dislike this movie no matter what. That's too bad.

He is trying to tell his story, not only in historical terms, but in cinematic terms. Anyone who does not understand this will not give the picture a chance and will miss its greatness and power. There is even a warning regarding events depicted before it starts. Some scenes are composites, some created for dramatic purposes. Remember, this is a MOVIE. An important one to see, nonetheless.We do see all facets of Nixon in incredible fashion. Quick cuts, tons of stock-like footage, changes in time and narrative very similar to CITIZEN KANE, just a mind-boggling lot of great acting and powerful moments. This is Stone's strength, as he showed in JFK. We even get to see Nixon as a child on the farm in Whittier, CA. We see that this man WAS a self-made man, coming from a dirt-poor family and strict upbringing. He had a painful childhood, losing brothers to sickness, and he took full advantage as anyone would. His evolution from bright young idealist to grumpy (and he was grumpy) flawed politician is amazing, especially because of Anthony Hopkins portrayal. At first, you may seem uncomfortable, for this is not an impersonation. It is a characterization that grows on you as the film progresses.Stone gives the man a chance, contradictory to what many people have said about the film. He even appeared before Congress, where he was confronted by current politicians who do feel the film is accurate enough to be considered an historical document. There are a lot of painful moments, but they are there because this man was an unbelievably difficult person. There are also great triumphs such as China. Stone allows us to decide the makeup of Nixon. It is based on so many different personal accounts and documents, as well as possible folklore. Its a great film, exhausting. He could have been one of the great men in history, but it did end in disgrace.Be sure to watch all the way through the credits, while Stone gives a narration of events after Nixon's presidency, during actual footage of his funeral.

Awkwardly dropping to his knees alongside Secretary of State Henry Kissinger, Nixon tells him, Never be too proud to get on your knees before God. Amusingly, this is the fist time in the picture that God is even mentioned. After a beat, Nixon says, I hope this doesn't embarrass you, Henry. To which Kissinger replies (in the wake of the New York Times leaking 47 volumes of top secret tapes to the public), No, I don't mind. This isn't going to leak, is it? Producer-director Oliver Stone, working from an original screenplay by Stephen J. Rivele, Christopher Wilkinson, and himself, has tackled the practically insurmountable task of covering Nixon's roller-coaster political career from the 1960 Presidential debate alongside John F. Kennedy to his final walk from the White House in 1974 (with high-contrast black-and-white flashes of his childhood on a California lemon farm). There's so much to take in, so much minutiae to absorb, that Stone's inconsistent filmmaking style becomes a burden rather than an attribute (the indifference to the visual compositions and the hectic editing is noticeable almost immediately). As Nixon, Anthony Hopkins has just as many hurdles to conquer; the actor gives a consummate performance, yet he looks and sounds nothing like the real Richard Nixon (his camouflaged British accent at times lapsing into Irish). Nixon's connections with Cuba, and his naming of the Watergate burglars as Cubans with ties to the Bay of Pigs, isn't sorted out for us in layman's terms (much of the picture is mind-bogglingly complicated), and so huge chunks of the production fail to have the kind of impact which can make a political film great, a masterpiece. Nixon doesn't have the depth for that. Stone's elaborate, artistic gestures are felt, but they cannot compensate for moments when the movie bogs down in its own rancid talk, or dead-end scenes between Nixon and long-suffering wife Pat (Joan Allen, who alternately looks pained or smugly vindicated). Stone has gathered together an amazing group of actors here, but several of the key performers fail to come through with their reenactments (part of which is Stone's fault, who turns Nixon into Zelig--or Forrest Gump--interacting with newsreel footage of real-life political players; no actor can compete with the real thing).

This annoying binary infects the entire film, Stone inviting us to weep over a Nixon who never had love, affection and support and snarl at Nixon the cartoon menace. It's all so calculated, so obvious in its construction.One rule of thumb is to treat with extreme suspicion all works of art (and historical films in particular) which pretend to be fair and balanced. Impartiality is a pretext which often masks the fact that an artist is acknowledging insignificant evils as a means of avoiding larger evils, and celebrating gifts and positive traits as a means of avoiding more important or complex positive traits. In this regard, Nixon systematically demonizes Nixon for the wrong things and systematically praises or empathises with him for completely the wrong reasons. It's 3 hours of missing the point on both ends of the spectrum.If Stone's film has no real world relevance, and practically nothing to say about history, his wounded duck image of Nixon nevertheless does home in one political truth the government is a beast which moves forward independent of leadership. The machine was running before Nixon got there, and continues to run long after he's left, every president inheriting a wheel that is already in motion, his office at the mercy of institutions (CIA, FBI, DEA, IRS etc) which work far beyond any four year presidential term.Aesthetically, the film is a mess. The film's mixed media and quasi-documentary segments now look dated in today's hyper-mediated world and Stone's baroque visuals and camera angles, noticeably inspired by Welles and to a lesser extent Eisenstein and Stalinist cinema, inspire chuckles rather than awe.Actor Anthony Hopkins plays the eponymous Nixon, but his performance can't compete with Philip Baker Hall and Frank Langella's rendering of the same character in Secret Honor and Frost/Nixon. Hopkins plays Nixon as a series of annoying tics rather than any truly three dimensional personality, and the film's conveyor belt of recognisable actors in bit parts is equally distracting, though as the film ages, younger audiences will no doubt find these faces comfortably unfamiliar.6/10 &#x96; The less Stone has to say, the more he raises his voice.

Historically Stone competes with the European director Costa-Gavras on movies with plots based on political and historical facts. Nixon is another Stone's film; this time the fortunate hero is the 37th USA president, Richard Nixon, who became more famous because of Watergate scandal than of his well-doing when he was president. Stone was able to draw the life of Nixon (Anthony Hopkins) from his childhood passing through his youth until he became somebody politically important in USA. Nixon's origin was not from rich family, totally the opposite, a poor family affected by several constraints. The success of the film is not as much in the description of what happened in Watergate, but in drawing the personality of Nixon, his character, and some episodes of his life, including the story of his contacts with wealthy people in Texas early 60s shortly before John F. Kennedy was shot in Dallas as well as when Bobby Kennedy was killed during his campaign for the post of president in 1968. The sensitivity of the president, the advice of his wife, the ways his political advisers moved, the involvement of Cuban contras in the Watergate, his relationship with Hoover, FBI boss (Bob Hoskins), his interventions in the preparation of the failed Bay Pigs invasion in 1961, his decisions on Vietnam's war, all these are shown carefully with high degree of historical exactitude. The end of the film seems to be an ambiguous way of Stone to make happy those people sympathetic with the president.Anthony Hopkins's face is far to be similar to the one of Richard Nixon. However, he was able to move and to behave as if he were Nixon. That movement as if he has a hanger put on the shoulders, Hopkins did it very well. His feeling, his nervousness and other reactions from the president, I assume, were also well imitated. James Woods was also excellent as usual in his role as president's adviser, Haldeman, quite cynical, by the way; while Hoskins showed us a tough and tricky Hoover, far from the one played by Treat Williams some years before. Personally I found very interesting the acting of Joan Allen as the Nixon's wife Pat. Probably she was able to reflect well the desires of Nixon's wife, the ways she looked at politics and to what extent the political career of her husband hinders their normal lives.

Filtering the national and (to Nixon) personal meltdown of Watergate through the mindscape and biography of its central player, Stone imagines and documents a whirlwind of events, characters, and nightmares that come to a head in the 1960s and early 70s -- but as turbulent, and compelling, as all this is, the film succeeds also in a manner of mod-Shakespearean character incision. Anthony Hopkins doesn't quite look or sound like Nixon but he is Nixon -- all clammy, smiley failed charm and cunning smarts. As with JFK, Nixon's sister film, Stone assembles a massive and memorable cast with Joan Allen a knife-edged Pat Nixon and oily-creep wonkiness coming from James Woods and the late great J.T. Walsh as Haldeman and Ehrlichman; Frasier's David Hyde Pierce is unctuous as presidential lawyer John Dean and Paul Sorvino channels Kissenger -- oh, and Bob Hoskins is suitably weird as the J. Edgar Hoover we came to know and love. (On DVD, Sam Waterston turns FBI director Richard Helms into a black-irised golem.) John Williams' score rumbles disturbingly throughout -- a counterpoint to his elegiac heroism and knuckle-crunching conspiracy beats from JFK, and Stone's great cinematographer/collaborator Robert Richardson mixes stock and format and vision in a manner that's typically dizzying and slyly and meaningfully calculated. But this is ultimately Mr. Stone's picture and, like JFK, it will alienate any one who can't keep at least an open mind to the vagaries of what we perceive as history. Stone tears at that accepted history like the smart (and funny) pitbull he is. JFK and Nixon make for one long double bill but few others are their equal.

It's not surprising that STONE has always used the 60's as the backdrop for most of his noir movies after all the 60's was a pivotal time in American History if not the rest of the world for a lot of reasons. Nixon in my opinion captures the very essence of the cold war and how it affected a younger generation that wasn't ready to lose it's innocence. This movie has all the ingredients as a stand alone masterpiece with all the major players of that turbulent era playing their part which reshaped the landscape of American politics ever after. If there's one insight I have gained through this film from the life of this tragic figure President Nixon it is this that in spite of his obvious and well documented weaknesses had he happened to be the President of the United States during World War II I believe he would have been greater than JFK he may have even rose next to greatness as his own mental image of the ultimate American Statesman, Abraham Lincoln. Lastly, all credit goes out to Sir Anthony Hopkins who embodied the spirit of this American icon and probably fleshed out the best portrayal of any American president in film history to date.

He presents Mr. Nixon as a man one can have sympathy for because of his intense insecurity and feelings of persecution from the 'Eastern Elite'. This goes back to his troubled childhood growing up poor in Los Angeles and always trying to live in Jack Kennedy's shadow. I was around (17years old) when he resigned in 1974 and remember being forced by my parents to watch his resignation speech. There was all the alarm of a nation coming undone but we just went on normally with the transition of Nixon to Ford. Mr. Stone takes liberties with much of this movie infusing his own judgement and political take on the man. I don't feel he demeans Mr. Nixon, although both of Nixon's daughters denounced the movie. I just feel that he shows us through Anthony Hopkin's brilliant portrayal that he was a very embittered and power hungry man who had the world at his command, then lost everything.

I particularly took offense to his somewhat facile dismissal of camera tricks, stating that camera movement is justified only if it adds to our understanding of character or plot. In addition to being untrue and easily disproved, that was probably lifted from some manifesto of cinema-verite, neorealism, or some other austere European abomination. The reason that Oliver Stone's commanding visual style works for Nixon is that the film is operatic, spanning decades and the heights and depths of an ambitious man's life. With such grandiosity, the presence of visual style and accents is fully justified and even necessary since it necessarily distances the viewer from the characters, allowing the movie to be viewed as an epic.

The movie focused heavily on Nixon's alcoholism. True, President Pinocchio (as I like to call him) was often drunk, but I don't know whether or not he was to the extent that they portray in the movie. Moreover, while Stone did a good job looking at Watergate, he probably could have focused more on Nixon's dirty tricks campaign to spy on protesters, or his assassinations of Black Panthers and American Indian Movement activists, or his overthrow of Chile's government.Overall, the movie is worth seeing.

Nixon is a surprisingly strong and sympathetic biography of perhaps our most controversial president. But for every JFK, Nixon, and Platoon that Stone made, he also made films like Natural Born Killers, Any Given Sunday, and The Hand. Those were absolute stinkers.Nixon was a box office bomb when released in 1995. Many people either didn't care about the former president, or didn't want to see him trashed like they feared Stone would. The film however doesn't paint Nixon into the monster you might assume. We see a very distant, but determined man devoted to his career and family. We see him bottom out after losses to JFK in 1960 and also in the California governor's race shortly after. Just when it seems his political career might be over, he finds himself the most desired Republican candidate for the 1968 presidential election. The extremists like J. Edgar Hoover and Larry Hagman's mysterious character all but demand he run. Nixon does indeed want the job quite badly, but his wife (played to perfection by Joan Allen) has some reservations.Nixon is elected in 1968, and we see him battle with the anti-war crowd, deal with the Chinese, and win a huge landslide in 1972. But as we all know, things fall apart after his re-election. It seems that people working under him have been a part of all manner of illegal goings on. Nixon acts like a man with a lot to hide, and we see him sacrifice one after another of his inner circle to try and save his skin. The film ends with his resignation and then there are some snippets from his funeral ceremony.The film is very well-crafted. Like JFK, it uses a lot of quick cuts to historical footage mixed in with the dramatic elements. We see Nixon's terrible childhood filmed in harsh b/w, and glossier colors for his later years. The acting is top drawer, to say the least. Hopkins does a terrific job, though he looks nothing like the real Nixon. The inner circle is made up of many familiar and talented faces. (Woods, Boothe, Walsh, etc) Paul Sorvino does a Henry Kissinger that has to be seen to be believed.The film is underrated, and definitely worth seeing. I'm sure Stone took his liberties here and there with the subject matter, but so what? History will forever be unkind to President Nixon, and perhaps it should be. Now if only someone would have the guts to make a film like this about Clinton.....8 of 10 stars from The Hound.

The same sort of meticulous storytelling and blending of archive news footage is used to dramatize the rise and fall of our 37th president.It's obvious that Oliver Stone is particularly fascinated with this point of time in American history (who wouldn't be, it was a decade rich in drama). My interest in this film is partly one of a personal nature.Three times in my life, my path crossed that of Richard Nixon's.  After his defeat in 1960, he settled in my town, San Marino, CA, and I used to ride my bike past his house every day on the way to school.  I always wondered what was going on behind the walls and drawn shades of that modest home - a mystery seemed to hang over the place.After Cambodia and the student killings at Jackson State and Kent State in May of 1970, me and some friends drove non-stop for nearly 24 hours from New Orleans to attend the protest rally in Washington, DC.  We arrived at the Washington Monument about 500 in the morning and were greeted by several people who told us we'd just missed Nixon.  He'd come out in the pre-dawn hours to talk to the protestors, and everyone was in a bit of shock at what they'd seen of him.  Later that day we were teargassed trying to break through the cordon they'd set up outside the White House.Finally, after Nixon retired and I believe after Pat had died, he bought my great uncle's home in Saddle River, NJ, just a few miles from where my parents lived.  I wanted to go over there and finally meet him face to face, but considering my shoulder length hair at the time, I didn't think I'd be very well received.Nixon is an interesting character in American history, someone whose life spanned the Great Depression through the peace and prosperity of the post-Cold War years.  He rose to prominence during the red scare period after WWII and was there during the nurturing of the military industrial complex (Eisenhower's words).  Defeated by Kennedy and the vision of Camelot in 1960, Nixon rose from the ashes after Johnson bungled the war in Vietnam. But after having victory in his grasp, the darkness overwhelmed him and he faded into political oblivion over a petty burglary of Democratic headquarters at the Watergate.Oliver Stone does an excellent job for the most part of capturing the inner person of Richard Nixon.  His childhood traumas are re-enacted and inserted into the dramatization of his adult life to emphasize the turmoil within him.  The feelings of inadequacy and guilt that led to his self-destructive behavior are one of the major themes in this film.Another one which the director also touched on in JFK was his involvement in the circle of people surrounding the Bay of Pigs, Castro assassination plots, and of course Kennedy's own murder.  Oliver Stone hints in a rather broad manner that Nixon, the CIA, rightwing Texas oilmen, Cuban expatriates, Johnny Roselli, the mob, J. Edgar Hoover, and Howard Hunt were all in some sort of plot together that tied into Kennedy's assassination.  No details are given and nothing's ever definitive, but the suggestion hangs over the story like an evil spirit.The acting and direction are superb.   Anthony Hopkins does a fine portrayal of Nixon.  The shiftiness of the eyes, the haunted look on his face, the mannerisms of speech and how he carries himself, they're all there.  The cast is too vast to mention in its entirety, but of special note for their acting are Joan Allen as Pat Nixon, James Woods as H. R. Haldeman, J. T. Walsh as John Ehrlichman, and Mary Steenburgen as Nixon's mother, Hannah. Paul Sorvino does a terrific impersonation of Henry Kissinger, and Edward Hermann is uncanny as Nelson Rockefeller.I do have some criticisms, however.  There are several gratuitous slaps at Nixon's character in the countless scenes of him drinking and taking pills. I don't know if he was a boozer and a pill popper in private, but it never crossed over into his public life and I think Oliver Stone should have left them out of the film.Also, the scene where Nixon meets Mao during his visit to open relations with China is just plain silly.  The director has Mao philosophizing about how they're both evil men and that he's too old to care what anyone thinks of him.  This is obviously a complete fabrication of events and is just another sign of gratuitous editing by Oliver Stone.But all in all this is a fine film and a fascinating one to watch, both for its take on history and because of the great filmwork.  I just wish Olive Stone would quit holding back what he really thinks of the VRW conspiracy. "},{"Title":"Flawed, yes, but a great film nonetheless","Date":"17 September 2003","Score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Biography, Drama, History","Review":" This may indeed be Oliver Stone's masterpiece, although as one would expect from Oliver Stone, it is a flawed and disjointed masterpiece, a monumental tragedy in the cathartic mode. There is an Orson Welles/Citizen Kane quality about the film that is fascinating, including a journalistic/newsreel-ish feel that is unmistakably derivative. But it isn't really about Richard Nixon. Rather what Oliver Stone has constructed here is a mythology about a certain political persona that resembles Nixon in a milieu that resembles American politics and some things that happened once upon a time some thirty years ago.Anthony Hopkins is brilliant and compelling in the title role, but in no way would I mistake him for Richard Milhous Nixon. He is both too depraved and all too human in his intense portrayal of the only president to resign under the pressure of impeachment. The Richard Nixon that I recall played his cards much closer to his vest (he was a terrific poker player, according to his naval buddies who lost a lot of their mustering out money to him aboard ship) and was not nearly as sympathetic as Hopkins and Stone make him. Nixon was cold and unfeeling except when it came to something that touched on his self-interest, and then he became pathological.One sees in this film traces of Oliver Stone's JFK (1991) in that he hints of a Cuban plot to kill John F. Kennedy while imagining that Lee Harvey Oswald was Cuban-inspired. Indeed, Stone intimates that J. Edgar Hoover was somehow involved in the assassination of Robert Kennedy in 1968 partly because he wanted to insure Nixon's victory by eliminating the one person who could beat him, and partly because his experience with Robert Kennedy as Attorney General was not a pleasant one for Hoover.Conspiracy was in the air in those days, and many Americans took it as gospel that FBI director J. Edgar Hoover was a player in those assassinations. And of course it is always wise to ask who benefits from certain events, and there is no doubt that Nixon would have had a lot more trouble beating Robert Kennedy in 1968 than he had in beating George McGovern. And Bobby Kennedy as president would have been a nightmare for the corrupt J. Edgar Hoover and his fiefdom.But Oliver Stone is not really interested in actual history as much as he is in his vision of the tortured Nixon himself and his fall from grace. It is strange but although Hopkins did not really look like Nixon or behave like Nixon (although he had some of the mannerisms down pat) it didn't matter because somehow he became a Nixon-like personage, a kind of ghost of Nixon, perhaps, a Nixon truer than true in some ways with his ever present worry about his image and his obsession with the Kennedy glamour that he could never have, his Republican cloth-coat middle-class heritage, and his gift for political infighting.One of the best scenes occurs under the Lincoln memorial as Nixon is confronted by some Vietnam War protesters and especially one 19-year-old girl who challenges his view of his responsibility and ultimately of himself. What Stone is able to do through such scenes is to make Anthony Hopkins's Nixon more sympathetic than the real Nixon ever was. We see Hopkins as a tortured Shakespearean protagonist, King Lear or Othello or Hamlet, souls tormented with the contrast between the grandeur of their station, and the weakness of their flesh.Another great scene is when the Texas power broker threatens Nixon by reminding him who made him and who can destroy him. Nixon is unperturbed as he counter-threatens the power broker with the holy terror of the IRS, and then smiles as though it is just another day at the office.A third great scene is late in the film as a drunken Pat Nixon confronts Nixon, who is falling apart under the pressure of the Watergate investigation, her eyes the eyes of woman looking at a worm, her manner accusatory and venomous. In the end we come to identify with Nixon as we did with Lear and Hamlet, although of course Nixon properly seen is more like Claudius.Although I recall the players from the Nixon years, Haldeman, Erhlichman, Henry Kissinger, John Dean, Al Haig, Attorney General John Mitchell and his bimbo wife Martha (burlesqued in a fine cameo by Madeline Kahn), and the rest of them, I couldn't form distinct persons in my mind. The actors themselves are top notch for the most part, James Woods, J. T. Walsh, Paul Sorvino, Ed Harris, E.G. Marshall, etc., but the real world contrast between their countenances and those of the historical figures was so glaring as to be almost comical at times.Of course there was no getting around this. Stone had to either hire unknown actors or to just live with the unreality of the actors not really resembling the people they were portraying. There were some striking exceptions, however. Joan Allen as Pat Nixon, the president's straitlaced and ever loyal (in public) wife was something close to a dead-ringer, and Allen did a brilliant job of bringing the historical first lady to life. Sorvino did not look all that much like Henry Kissinger, but his voice and manner were absolutely perfect. David Barry Gray who played Nixon as a young man did indeed look a lot like the young Nixon.Also worth noting are Mary Steenburgen who played Nixon's mother, and Bob Hoskins who played J. Edgar Hoover. Steenburgen seemed the very embodiment of the wise and hardtack Quaker mother while Hoskins's sleazy lampoon of Hoover was creepy enough to make your skin crawl.(Note Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!

Millhouse is an astonishingly prescient documentary.  Made when Nixon was at the pinnacle of his popularity and achieving miracles of global diplomacy, and seemingly invincible, the short film catalogues those episodes in Nixon's public life which constitute a read-out of his tortured personality.  It's all here, a year before the Watergate break-ins ever happened.        Alger Hiss was everything that Nixon feared and despised.  An East Coast intellectual, graduate of Johns Hopkins and Harvard Law School, Hiss breezed into important government posts almost as of right.  In 1948 he was accused of spying for the USSR, and this gave rookie congressman Nixon the opportunity he craved.  Nixon hounded Hiss at public hearings and was party to the fabrication of microfilm 'evidence' which irretrievably blackened Hiss's name.  The pattern was established - Nixon would ride rough-shod over anyone, and over the truth, in his ruthless push for self-promotion.       The Checkers broadcast of 1957 comes next.  Finding himself (as Eisenhower's vice-president) accused of financial irregularities, Nixon hired a TV slot and made a 'personal vindication' speech of excruciatingly bad taste, culminating in the blatant grab at popular sentimentality, the reference to Checkers, his daughter's puppy.  This was gushing emotional whoredom.  It was vintage Nixon.        The Kennedy televison debate of 1960 was a watershed in popular culture.  Kennedy projected youth and confidence, whereas a heavy-jowled Nixon seemed to exude grubby mediocrity.  Those who listened to the debate on the radio regarded Nixon as the victor, but anyone who has seen the images will have no doubt whose triumph it was.  In Stone's film, Nixon offers this telling analysis Kennedy showed people a vision of how they would like to be, whereas Nixon reminded them of how they actually were.      In 1962, having lost the 1960 presidential election, Nixon ran for gubernatorial office in his native California.  Once again he was defeated (this time by Brown), and he decided to leave public life.  His appearance in front of the cameras to announce his retirement is electrifying to watch.  This is raw Nixon, with the sweating upper lip, the nervous, humourless laugh and the maudlin self-pity - You won't have Nixon to kick around any more.        Altman's Secret Honor is a remarkable one-man performance by Philip Baker Hall.  The film emphasises one aspect of Nixon's career which Stone also makes much of - the intervention of the shadowy money men.  Nixon's incredible fightback from oblivion in 1962 to national triumph in 1968 was, suggest both film-makers, facilitated by a clandestine group of western arch-conservatives who bankrolled the campaign.  Stone shows Nixon facing down his benefactors, but it does not ring true.  Plucky confrontations with father-figures was not his style.     Stone faithfully reproduces all of these landmarks in Nixon's personal journey, but this film is not a dispassionate biography.  It is an attempt to understand a man through his emotions.  The methodology is to examine Nixon's childhood and early career for clues to the man's inner core.  The result is a mighty film, four hours of unflagging emotional intensity, ultimately marred by Stone's obsessive need to see conspiracy everywhere.      Richard Milhous Nixon was raised in Whittier, California in the 1920's.  His eccentric family were old-style quakers (his mother refers to him as 'thee' in the film) with no money and severe religious views, prizing emotional self-containment above all else.  Two of Nixon's brothers died of tuberculosis, and the adult Nixon (suggests Stone) carried a burden of guilt and emotional paralysis.  Stone argues that these personality distortions gave Nixon his intense ambition, sublimating maternal approval with voter-recognition.  Unfortunately for this strange, tortured man, the source of his inner drive was also the seed of his destruction.  Nixon's paranoid conviction that they were out to get him blurred in his own mind the boundaries of what was legitimate, and irony of ironies, led him to tape-record all conversations.  His urge to vindicate himself, and have the 'dope' on everyone else, ended by trapping him in admissions of criminality which simply could not be explained away.      Stone demonstrated in J.F.K. that he 'buys' the conspiracy theory of the Kennedy assassination wholesale.  In Nixon he gives his liberal paranoia free rein.  We learn of a sinister 'Track Two', a murder plot which links the Bay of Pigs to Chappaquiddick and even the shooting of Governor Wallace.  Stone's Nixon is appalled to learn that Howard Hunt has been arrested in the Watergate complex, because I know what he is and what he tracks back to.  In the film, we see Edgar Hoover and Johnny Rosselli colluding to 'fix' a horse race.  This is all rather bizarre.  Powers Boothe is a magnificent screen presence in the role of Al Haig, but the real Haig (as evidenced in Emery's 1994 book, Watergate) was more hapless bungler than tight-lipped Machiavelli.      When judged as an artistic project rather than a work of historical scholarship, the film has real merit.  If the theory of an all-pervasive web of conspiracy lacks supporting evidence, it is, as an analysis, at least worthy of consideration.  Stone's central contention, however, is even darker.  He sees Nixon as the Anti-Christ, the embodiment of evil itself, a demon who kills or ruins all who come into contact with him.  Just as his brother Harold's death freed-up the money for Nixon to attend law school, so the slayings of the Kennedy brothers cleared his path to the White House.  In the end, in classic tragic style, the monster could not help consuming himself.

And I am one of those guys who stays to the bitter end of every movie. I see it as almost a badge of honor. But there are 4 movies I have failed in the last two years, and this is one of them.I don't think Nixon was an especially bad movie. I just could not get into it. There was a lot of dialogue, but I could never figure out who was doing the talking and what their significance to the story was. That was the first problem. Huge cast of characters, but I was not familiar enough with the events with which they were associated or with who they were supposed to be to be able to follow along. In addition, the movie had a few flash-backs and fast-forwards, which didn't help in sorting things out.The second problem was that Anthony Hopkins just didn't look like Richard Nixon. He did his typical fine performance, but in this movie, acting was not enough. Richard Nixon's appearance is so distinctive that there is no way you can sort of look like him. You either do, or you don't. Nixon's sharp features preclude him from being well-represented by only a close resemblance. All they gave Hopkins was Nixon's type II pattern baldness hairline. I watched scene after scene with seemingly random people who I couldn't keep straight and this old sad-sack that was always right in the middle of them. I had to keep reminding myself that the sad sack was supposed to be Richard Nixon.As stated earlier, I don't think this was an especially bad movie. For me, it just did not flow well. I had to help it along, and with its confusing cast of characters that became too great a struggle. I'm not sure when I turned it off, but I think it was after over 2 hours of watching. I'm sure I was near the end and I probably could have finished it, but I was so confused by that time that I didn't see the point.After thinking back, the movie plays more like a documentary than a vehicle for entertainment. It is heavy on facts and history and might be more suited to students of political history. It is a thinking person's movie. Maybe that was my problem. I was just looking for something to relax to before I went to bed. You have to be prepared to work to get through this one. A suggestion might be for you to Google Nixon before watching it to get some background refreshers. Or maybe you just need to be older than I am. I think if you were a politically-aware adult in the early 70s you'd probably have enough knowledge to be able to follow this film. But I was only in second grade when I learned that President Nixon was going to have peaches.

I think that we all knew that Stone would do a hatchet job on Nixon, and that he did.During this viewing, in addition to my own remembering, I had the gift of YouTube. Take, for example, the 1962 concession speech when he lost the gubernatorial election in California. First watch it in the film. I didn't remember it quite so negatively as the film portrayed, though it was far from Nixon's finest hour. I immediately watched that concession speech on You Tube. Sure enough, while negative, Nixon was much more in control of his speech and mannerisms than the film implies, and it came across much more reasonably than in the film's depiction. And then there's the sweating and the 5 o'clock shadow. Certainly traits that Nixon did suffer from. But he didn't sweat as often or as profusely as Stone depicted. He often looked clean shaven (although I'm sure he had to work at it).And then there's Anthony Hopkins' characterization of Nixon. We should not expect the kind of mimicry that David Frye did in his impressions, but I found Anthony Hopkins' portrayal way off target. Nixon was not fat with ill-fitting suits, as is Hopkins. The speech was not even close. Similarly, over the closing credits, Nixon's farewell speech to staff is recreated. Watch it on the film. Then watch it on You Tube. What in the film appears terribly painful was, in my view, perhaps Nixon's finest hour...and by the way, he wasn't sweating half as much as Oliver Stone portrayed.The two castings that rang most true for me were Joan Allen as Pat Nixon...almost perfect (although that's not to say that she did what is portrayed in the film); and Paul Sorvino who had Henry Kissinger's speech patterns down perfectly. Edward Herrman was quite good in the small role of Nelson Rockefeller...not so much in looks, but in body language. David Hyde Pierce seemed quite suited to be John Dean. The rest of the main characters were, in my view botched...botched to the point where Haldeman and Erlichman almost come off looking good! In the last 15 or so minutes of a very long film, it seems as if Stone attempts to be a little more sympathetic to Nixon. He fails.Now I know what you're saying...that I'm an annoyed Republican. Nope. The first time I ever voted -- in 1968 -- I voted for Nixon, but the next time around I didn't vote for him because he lied about his secret plan to end the Vietnam War. In fact, I voted Democractic in virtually every election since 1968. But, fair is fair, and this film is simply not fair. As I said, most of us expected a hack job from Oliver Stone, and that's exactly what we got.

I am not an Olver Stone fan and I am more on Steven Spielberg's side, but then, I really wanted to see a Nixon movie. Richard M. Nixon was and still sadly is a traduced, maligned and ill-depicted man but he was a real man, driven and deep, full of demons (who isn't?) and really decent in many (but not all) ways. Anthony Hopkins did a great job here, maybe, too far sometimes. I saw many footages with real Nixon and he was not that caricature as Hopkins depicted him. And come on, was he really that much into drinking? The sources are highly controversial in there. Anyway, that was very compelling and mind-provoking to see that monster of a film and realize how multi-faceted and difficult Nixon was, and all who were near him. The brilliant cast of drama heavies (Woods, Sorvino, Allen, Hoskins, Harris) did a decent job, true. But one serious claim remains - the life of this great man was so large and busy that even 3 hours were not enough. Must have been a serial or several films. There are some more complaints about the movie - no Chuck Colson, no deeper plot with Ed Harris, not enough on McCarthy - but still, the film is not bad.

His obsession with his enemies which led to the documentation and cover-up which ultimately bought him down, are bad and unenviable. Stone, in this thoughtful and powerful biographical movie about Nixon, posits that Nixon was haunted by the ghosts of a pious and, for Richard, insufficiently attentive mother as well as the loss of two brothers before Richard was 20 to diseases which would not have claimed those two young men today. Again, a quite compelling case for Nixon as haunted and insecure made by this movie and many books, for one Nixon and Kissinger by Robert Dallek, is not grounds to dismiss the many faults which became apparent during Nixon's tortured Presidency. However, Nixon's character flaws seem so deep that he seems a Shakespearean character sometimes, nearly helpless against the hands of time. This is the best film Oliver Stone has made, in my opinion. Natural Born Killers was bizarre and not coherent enough to thoughtfully skewer the media's fixation with violence and gore, it seemed to me. While the satire at some points was extremely powerful, in order for satire to work, one needs material which might engage and interest the viewer also. JFK put Oliver in the category of JFK conspiracy nuts with too much time and bandwidth (though it wasn't available at that time) at his disposal. He posited a largely discredited theory which postulates some quite crazy beliefs. Nixon though, it seemed to me, struck just the right balance between recognizing the role of the psyche in effecting fate and in recognizing the deviousness and ambition which played crucial roles in poisoning the leadership of Richard Milhous Nixon. Stone's cinematography and use of flashbacks in the film is second-to-none. He flashes back to incidents in Richard's life (his brothers' deaths, his father's coldness) which may have made indelible marks on young Richard and which gave rise to the innately reserved politician working in the quintessentially wrong profession. As Nixon himself said, I'm an introvert working in an extrovert's field. The acting in the film, from Joan Allen as a devoted Pat Nixon who herself seems mystified by her husband's reserves at times to James Woods as an efficient, bland Ehrlichman, to David Paymer as a deers-in-the-headlight press secretary Ron Ziegler, from Powers Boothe as a low-key Gen. Alexander Haig who supported Nixon's most authoritarian moves to Paul Sorvino as a slouching, perfectly voiced Kissinger, the acting is superb. Anthony Hopkins, who always seems to have something of a natural reserve about him, plays Nixon very well. He seems painfully shy, behind all the bluster and braggadocio, and as the scandals deepen and he becomes increasingly isolated, he is unable to separate fact from paranoia and dream. He received an Oscar nomination for which he, I think appropriately, did not win the Oscar, but Joan Allen I think was deserving of the Best Supporting Actress Oscar. She is at turns her husband's rock, insecure, loving, his sounding board, the only person able to be honest with him, protective, and jealous. It is a fantastic, supremely self-assured effort.Stone's direction could well have won him an Oscar and I think it deserved the nod. Contrasting the multiple sides of Richard Nixon and his incredible shrinking Presidency required a great deal of ability and never has Stone shown it more than in this film. He situates the material in just the right proportion, in just the right way, not excusing Nixon, but depicting him as a man haunted by painful memories and quite possibly the man with the worst career counselor in the history of man. To depict such a tortured character as Nixon so sympathetically but not as a hagiographer might, is a magnificent accomplishment.

Stone goes deep into the life of Nixon, his upbringing, love for his wife and daughters and his paralyzing fear of defeat.Stone Portrays Nixon as a fellow who was mediocre at best at pretty much everything, he never really stood out other than the fact that he was always there. lost nearly every election of his life, and when he finally won one, he was in the fear of losing the next one. The film also looks deep into his helplessness as he learns that as the president he has been reduced to a figurehead, and that the agencies now control the country, his fear for his life (see JFK assassination) is what makes him keep giving in to it all until he becomes something of a Darth Vader.I love the editing on this film, and the score is beautiful, the first 20 minutes is absolutely haunting.

Fantastic acting mainly from Anthony Hopkins, but with an excellent supporting cast. Oliver Stone is allowed a little scope in introducing some scenes that probably did not take place, but the main body of the film is linked to the history of Nixon and his era. When I watched Hopkins on the screen it was Nixon in front of me and not the actor, no mean feat bearing in mind his subject was known to millions. Yet you felt that it was Nixon and that you were there in the White House with him and his cronies, or watching his relationship with wife Pat, played beautifully by Joan Allen, slowly deteriorate.I thought the flashbacks throughout the film to his earlier life worked well, as they brought out a caring and even romantic side to Nixon that seemed to disappear in his later years as a very combative politician.Although Oliver Stone had his critics, I thought politically the balance was fair enough and I speak as someone who credits Nixon with playing a large part if the ending of the Cold War.It may be better to know a little bit about this era, politically, before watching this film or it may not make that much sense. So why not read a book about Nixon first. Afterwards you can decide what was fact and what was in Oliver Stone's mind for the rest.

Also, Hopkins as Nixon came off as someone notably foul mouthed. History's Richard Nixon was known to use some mildly strong language from time to time, but no where near to the extent that Stone suggests.Paul Sorvino is an impressive and believable Henry Kissinger, while other real life individuals are portrayed out of character, or in some cases simply mixed and matched to suit Oliver Stone's conspiracy driven objective.As a work of fiction, the film is enjoyable and the characters interesting. However, as a historically relevant work, the film is disappointing and fails to achieve any realism. Audiences believing that they are learning about Nixon, the man, are being wrongfully mislead.

Visually, Nixon is always stunning and never boring, even with a three-hour run time.    He attempts to make new film footage look 40, 50, or even 60 years old at various points in the movie, and he succeeds. And that's not easy. Many directors try it and fail. Stone goes the extra mile to make a movie LOOK convincing, and he deserves points for that.     And of course, the acting is spectacular. Anthony Hopkins is one of the finest actors of our time, and he does a spectacular job playing Nixon. Joan Allen IS Pat Nixon. J.T. Walsh, James Woods, Bob Hoskins, Powers Boothe, Mary Steenburgen, and the other actors are fantastic, as you would expect.    The problem? As usual, Stone doesn't let the facts get in the way of his story. There are just too many moments in this movie that don't ring true, either because they PROBABLY didn't happen, or because we KNOW they didn't happen.     Let's not even go into Stone's usual conspiratorial claptrap. In Stone's world, everyone from the CIA to Howdy Doody was mixed up in the Kennedy assassination. Suffice it to say we get a healthy dose of this nonsense in Nixon, all of it unsupported by anything remotely resembling evidence. But since I knew this was an Oliver Stone movie, I knew going in that I was going to have to tolerate his usual shtick.     But there OTHER things -- other points of history -- that are a little off.    First, the movie claims Nixon entered the 1968 presidential contest only after LBJ's withdrawal in March of that year. Ridiculous. Nixon had been running for some time by that point. In fact, Nixon planned to run in '68 as early as '64. He even thought of running in '64, but concluded that LBJ was unbeatable. He campaigned hard for Republicans in the midterm election of '66, stored up a lot of favors, and used those favors when he ran in '68.    In fact, by the time LBJ withdrew in late March, the New Hampshire primary had already taken place. And Nixon won it. So there's no way he could have entered the race AFTER LBJ withdrew.    Next, the movie implies that Robert Kennedy was well on his way to winning the Democratic nomination in '68, but his assassination stopped it. (And of course, Stone implies that the Great Conspiracy Machine caused RFK's death.)     Most political observers at the time believed that Vice President Hubert Humphrey was the likely Democratic nominee, even without RFK's assassination. In the last edition BEFORE the shooting, U.S. News & World Report predicted Humphrey's nomination. The reason? Delegates.    In those days, there were fewer primaries, and they had a smaller impact. Most convention delegates were chosen by other means state conventions, caucuses, etc. Labor unions, Democratic officeholders, and party regulars really controlled the nomination process, and those people preferred Humphrey. Even Ted Sorensen, an aide to RFK in '68, admits that Kennedy just wouldn't have had the delegates to win the nomination.   (While we're on the subject of the 1968 campaign, I'm a little disappointed that Stone didn't devote more time to the Nixon-Humphrey-Wallace contest of the fall. It really is one of the most interesting elections in American history, given the closeness of the race, the issues at stake, and the personalities of the three men. What's more, it was a race in which Nixon saw a 15-point lead evaporate in six weeks, and a race in which Nixon's questionable dealings with the South Vietnamese may have altered the peace process, thus preventing Humphrey from winning. There could have been a Nixon scandal of Watergate proportions EVEN BEFORE Nixon was president.)       Next, the movie claims Nixon refused to contest the close 1960 election between Nixon and Kennedy. That's debatable. According to a recent Newsweek, printed after the close Bush-Gore election, Nixon actually did contest the results in ten close states. The recounts lasted into December, but did not change the outcome anywhere.     There are other things, but given this limited space, I won't go into them. But there's something about this movie that disturbed me more than any single factual error.    Simply put, I'm leery of any movie that puts fictional dialogue into real people's mouths. There are scenes with Richard and Pat Nixon alone together, talking about their marriage and their feelings for one another. I'm not comfortable SPECULATING about what they MIGHT have said. We'll never know. Pat Nixon said some hurtful things to her husband in this movie. How do we know she ever really did that?     I'm not a fan of the real Nixon. He did things in his political career that hurt a lot of people. He questioned the loyalty of a lot of good people -- Truman, Stevenson, Acheson, etc. He was only slightly more subtle than Joe McCarthy. His dirty tricks were an insult to every American voter. He got what he deserved in 1974.     But even Nixon doesn't deserve the portrait of him painted by Oliver Stone. In this movie, he does things he didn't do in real life and says things he never really said. Stone plays too fast and loose with the facts to be taken seriously as a historian. It's a shame, because the man is a brilliant moviemaker. It's the content that bothers me.

The movie is made with lots of style and solid acting performances but on the other hand the story is confusing, due to the high pace, much information and many characters. The movie is simply too short to cover the entire political life of Richard M. Nixon.Watergate, the Vietnam war, the white house tapes, Nixon's two terms it simply is all too much to tell in just one movie. Stone even manages to put some flashbacks in, about how Nixon grew up, something that was not really needed in my opinion. The movie too often gets confusing also because the pace is so incredible high. There is too much information to deal with.Still the movie is perfectly watchable, especially if you're a fan of Stone's visual style. I love the editing and the cinematography by Robert Richardson is superb!The acting is also great but what else did you expect from a cast like this? The movie is filled with some big names. OK Hopkins doesn't look at all like Nixon but still his performances is an impressive one and Joan Allen truly deserved her Oscar nomination. She perhaps is the strongest character of the entire movie.So conclusion is, is that this movie is best watchable for the Stone fans.

If Stone had allowed himself a limit to the 'Cane' imagery and references, possible through the aid of some type of Cane-o-meter on the set, all would have been fine. However, Stone proceeds to wield his extraordinarily weighty artistic hand and pummel us over the head with it for the better part of three hours and in the process rips off virtually every allegorical reference to Charles Foster Cane that could be though of. Heck, the only thing missing is the snow-globe and the sled. Thank the lord that Joan Allen doesn't try to sing opera. This is, without question, one of the heaviest handed directing jobs as well as one of the most overtly preachy and pompous of any by Stone, and that is saying' somethin'! Aside from this, the film also plays quite fast and loose with many facts regarding Kennedy, Cuba, and the Mafia. It seems like Stone is trying to defend his position in JFK more than actually make a true biopic.Leaving the above aside, Joan Allen is terrific, as is Anthony Hopkins. The supporting cast is superb right down the line (and EVERYBODY is in it), and the typecast of Larry Hagman as J.R. if raised by wolves (or George Wallace) was particularly inspired. Interestingly, Stone actually doesn't do too much of a hatchet job on the maligned ex-president and the film is somewhat reverential. However, the over-the-top caricature and smug unrelenting seriousness and 'holier-than-thou' attitude of the film gets a bit tedious. Not my favorite Stone film, but not my least favorite either.

I watched this with my father, who actually followed Nixon's career to some extent, and I can't deny that without his giving me cliff notes to explain actions and motivation of the characters every so often during the film, I wouldn't understand any of what happened. And that's the sad truth... if you don't know almost everything about Nixon, his time, the political situation, what happened during that period of time, etc. you won't understand it. The film hints at so many things, instead of making what happens clear, and presumes you know everything behind every situation, instead of providing any back-story. We get scene after scene, one situation after another with people we're supposed to know beforehand, situations we're expected to know of and understand and if you don't know of these, and you have no way of knowing them, you certainly won't know after watching the film. The film really isn't the story of Richard M. Nixon as much as it's Oliver Stone's objective presentation of him. How are we supposed to judge this man, his staff, or any of their actions when we don't know the situation or the background of it? Then there are of course those who do know these things... but why would they watch it? They already know the things presented in the movie, and probably from a far more reliable source. So, I guess what it comes down to is who is this film actually aimed at? Who can watch this and really enjoy it? My father suggested that Stone's intention with this film was to tell the story to young Americans, teenagers who weren't even alive when what the film is about happened. A good cause, but again, it requires them to already know of Nixon. And that is ultimately this movies downfall. The plot is very good, and from what I understand, quite accurate. The pacing is... off, I think is the right word. It switches between going insanely fast and painfully slow, making the film a sure-fire head-ache machine. The acting is perfectly flawless, and most, if not all of the characters based on real people are historically accurate in personality and appearance. The time-line is somewhat messed up, but the basic idea is that Nixon is actually sitting and thinking back on all this stuff, so it makes perfect sense and is used nicely(as opposed to as a cheap gimmick). The film is good, definitely, it's just so limited in who it will appeal to, and the pacing is a real killer(and I don't mean that in the good way). I recommend this to anyone who is interested in Nixon and big fans of Oliver Stone. I suppose very big fans of members of the cast might want to give it a chance as well. 7/10 "},{"Title":"one of stone's better films, but that's not saying much","Date":"4 May 2003","Score":"1 out of 3 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Biography, Drama, History","Review":"  I have never been an Oliver Stone fan, mostly because it seems like every time he tries to make a movie, he ends up with a 3 ½ hour, unnecessarily intense film that tries its hardest to manipulate your thoughts and emotions.  Nixon was somewhat different in the sense that Stone finally seemed to have relaxed a little bit and let the story unfold naturally, instead of cramming it down our throats.  I did feel that the movie was way too cut up to be enjoyable, and that took credibility away from the story. I have no problem with flashbacks and so on as a means of developing a plot, but Stone seemed to do them without any sense of order. The movie just skipped around to the point that I was never sure what year it was, or even really what was going on. I think Hopkins did a very decent job of portraying Nixon, and his performance really made Nixon look a lot better than he probably was. Stone did do a good job of trying to show us a side of Nixon that we probably weren't aware of.  Whether this was an actual side of his personality or not remains to be seen since Stone has a history of fudging facts now and then. I also thought a lot of the shots were pretty over the top, using intense lighting and shadows, or dramatic cuts and close-ups to make what would have been a good scene look too manipulated. At the end of it, my main question was why was this movie made? Does anyone really care whether Nixon was a decent guy at heart, or that he had strict parents and that's what made him so power hungry?  I don't think so. The movie seemed to me to just be a waste of time in a way, giving us an in-depth look at the life of someone who's not that interesting.

Tut!","Date":"24 April 2002","Score":"0 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Biography, Drama, History","Review":"  Nixon must have been an interesting private figure.  People who try to get inside his head in order to scour it out with steel wool wind up kind of sympathizing with a guy who was one of our most disliked recent presidents. It would be so easy to chop him into bits.  Here he is, scowling, peering out from under his eyebrows  -- but no.  Nobody seems able to finish him off.  Lane Smith gave us the sad portrait of a man with a subtle sense of humor on TV years ago.  The historian Steven Ambrose started out to do a hatchet job on him in his biography.  Ambrose was an anti-war activist during the 1960s and early 70s, no Nixon lover, but has admitted in interviews that the more he looked into Nixon's life, the more empathy he had with him, not that he ever liked him -- Hell, Nixon didn't want to be loved; he wanted to be feared.  Stone's picture of Nixon is also rather sympathetic to the man, if not to the president.  It's a rather decent movie.  Stone's direction and editing militates against its being a very good movie, though.  I do wish he would dump some of his directorial excesses in works like this where they don't belong.  The result of all those lightning flashes and negative shots and one-second newsreel clips and multiple voiceovers is not insight or surprised pleasure, just vertigo. There must be some better way to show us Nixon's hardscrabble background. The cast is uniformly professional and competent, although I daresay that if you're not familiar with the story already you may get lost somewhere along the way in the multitude of supporting players.  Sir Anthony Hopkins' Nixon isn't the public Nixon we know.  He's Sir Anthony Hopkins playing a rather nicely put-together character with only a superficial resemblance to the historical personage.  It's still Nixon, of course, with his arid, sweaty grin, but the voice is quite different.  It's no longer English, but it's certainly not Nixon either.  Let's say that if you relax and close your eyes you begin to get intimations of John Huston in his speech.  He's got Nixon's hubris down pretty well, as in the Saturday night massacre when he wants to fire everybody in the Justic Department right down to the janitors. But ninety percent of the time, Hopkins' Nixon is a tortured human being.  What he's tortured by is never made clear.  Several portentous epigrams pop up to explain what's driving him -- He had greatness in his grasp, or whatever. Joan Allen as his wife asks, When are we going to stop paying your debts. (Try, If I hadn't been rich, I could have been a really great man.)  Was it his distant, stern religious father?  His cold, distant, religious mother?  (Nixon was raised a Quaker and his mother was devout.  Quakers don't get down on their knees and pray, as the real Nixon pointed out in an interview with David Frost.)  Maybe there is no big secret and no clinical archaeology is required.  Nixon simply might have thought he was ugly -- what with that nose and all.  It was good enough for Richard III.  The real Nixon, by the way, as far as we could get to know him through his public appearance and through one-on-one TV interviews, was capable of making quick and decisive decisions and emanated an air of self confidence.  This quality is lacking in the Nixon we see here.  And if he did get drunk and start mumbling to presidential portraits in the White House and if he wept and prayed, well, so what?  A lot of people would have handled his disgrace with less class.  (By the way, who squealed on him about that final scene?  Der treue Heinrich?)  Now, as much as I hate to admit the extent of my insensitivity and ignorance, after having watched the original TV spectacle of the Watergate Hearings, at least with one eye, and watching this film, I'm still not clear on exactly what he did that was so terribly wrong. Aside from the good things, like softening relations with China (which we called Red China), he seems to have suggested that the FBI cut off its investigation of that ridiculous burglary and at least hinted that an audit of his enemy's income taxes might reward the scrutiny of the IRS.  Man, were we naive in 1973.  After his fit of weeping, Nixon wanders the White House with a few aides and bemoans the fact that social institutions are no longer respected, the press has become an enemy, people have become cynical about politicians and so forth.  Right on the button, Dick!  He complains to his wife that the press and the public are not after him just because of any crimes he may have committed but because they hate him, yes, Richard M. Nixon.  I suppose this scene is supposed to be evidence of his paranoia. (How easily we sling these terms around.)  In retrospect, he seems to have been about half right.  He was elected president twice because he seemed the lesser of two evils each time.  Hubert Humphrey in 1968 was seen as a representative of the administration that had brought us Vietnam, whereas Nixon had a secret plan, which he refused to discuss.  In 1972, his opponent was George McGovern who made wild promises while trying desperately to prove that the party which had torn itself apart on very public TV four years earlier was now ready to roll again.  (He gave up, long before the election took place.)  I expect only a minority of people voted for Nixon because they actually liked him as a person.  I recall one of the reasons some people claimed to hate him.  Nixon had admitted in an interview, perhaps in Playboy, that his favorite food was cottage cheese with ketchup poured on it.  I may vote for that man for president but cannot bring myself to like him, I say to myself as I sit down to my dinner of escallope de veau chanticleer.  All the rest of Oliver Stone's film, meaning the hints and allusions to something going on during the missing 18 minutes, something about a Bay of Pigs deal with the Mafia that was somehow, some way, linked up with assassinations, and so forth, is nothing more than implausible and distracting conjecture.  Nixon's fall from office, his evidently unethical and perhaps illegal behavior while occupying that office (he was never convicted of anything), came as a shocking surprise to a public who found suddenly, to their fathomless dismay, that a president was actually capable of using the word expletive deleted in what he thought was a private conversation.  We've learned a lot since then.  Nowadays we hound our nominees and elected officials until we discover that, like all the rest of us, they did something naughty -- then we hang them.

By my count, Mr. President had 60 double whiskeys in a little over two hours. Now if you mix in the champagne cocktails and Texas chili dogs, Dick, was well over the legal limit for breathalizing with civility.The good...Anthony Hopkins, in his portrayal of 'Treeky Dick' gave a good account of himself but maybe not that of the real man.

He is a great director who knows how to engage an audience.  All of his films have great cinematography.  And this film is no exception.  The cinematography and music combine to create a film rich in artistic expression.Having said that, the film's art cannot offset two fundamental flaws.  The first flaw is the screenplay. The story comes across as muddled.  The constant flashbacks back and forth from 1973 to an earlier time period, then fast forward to the 70's, then back to the 50's, then suddenly forward to the 60's; back and forth we go. This jerky approach to biography is jarring and irritating. Also, the story suffers from having a jumble of background people who are not well defined.  Pat Nixon and Kissinger are easy to spot.  But the rest of those people; who exactly are they?  The worst example of this vagueness is the character played by Larry Hagman, someone named Jack Jones.  I have no idea who Jack Jones is, or was; the film certainly does not tell us.The second, and more serious, flaw is the way in which Stone portrays Richard Nixon.  The film starts and ends with --- Watergate.  Stone seems to pick and choose those personality traits, all negative, from earlier years that would explain Nixon's behavior during Watergate.  Did the man have no positive traits of any kind?Nixon, the man, comes across in the film as dark and brooding; ditto Pat Nixon.  I find it hard to believe that Nixon did not have a lighter side to his personality, or that he had no sense of humor; ditto Pat Nixon.  Stone makes much of the 18 minute gap in one of the Watergate tapes.  In this film, Stone demonstrates a gap of his own.  In this three hour biography of Richard Nixon, we have a gap of twenty years in Nixon's life.  From the time Nixon left the White House in 1974 until the time of his death in 1994, the film is strangely silent.I take that to mean that during those twenty years Richard Nixon demonstrated positive, humane qualities that were not consistent with Stone's view of Nixon as a dark, brooding, morbid, machiavellian character of the Watergate era.  What can we say about a biography that erases twenty years from a man's life?  Therefore, I question the validity of this film as a true biography.  One gets the impression that Stone, the director, is trying to manipulate the audience toward a skewed image of Nixon, the man.
