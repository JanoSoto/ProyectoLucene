A breakdown, the loss of working friendship with Mifune, funding difficulties...etc...but with all the changes that followed the completion of Red Beard, while watching I couldn't help notice that everything was ironically in bloom. Akira Kurosawa's direction was never better, Mifune never acted better and at it's core Red Beard tells a story borrowed heavily form Dostoevsky, thus making this a labour of love. This film is flawless in many respects, if you're a film student, such as myself, you can take everything and pick it apart and find...The story is a simple one, a wise and determined doctor impresses a young ambitious doctor into learning what humanity is and how it exists all around us and that without it we are nothing. It tells of humanity through children and adults and the lowest depths of human existence. Some have argued the subject was a little too heavy handed but Kurosawa has always maintained that sometimes heavy handedness is needed especially for those who don't get it with a slap. In my opinion, there are periods in every artists career when they are at their best. Miles Davis was at his best before his breakdown, but the breakdown was bound to happen after creating and giving so much. I feel this is what happened to Kurosawa, he gave all that he could give and with this film, if you truly study it and study it well, (the DVD version comes with an exceptional commentary) you will find that this is one of the most finely crafted films in cinematic history, in fact as far as direction goes, it is difficult for me to think of one better directed. Fellini's best, Ozu's best, Coppola's best, Welles' best, Antonioni, Visconti, De Sica, Goddard, Renoir, Melville, Erice, you name it, watch their best with the sound off take note of the direction then compare it with RED BEARD. You will be left breathless. Kurosawa is a GREAT among the GREATS. This is visual poetry. Kurosawa's great directorial swan song. Bittersweet, for after RED BEARD something within Akira profoundly changed.

When I saw it at a small art house cinema here in Vienna, Austria, it was like a lovely dream you want to go on and on. I left the cinema thinking I just saw the best film of my life. True, it not comparable with the story telling masterpiece Rashomon or the complex Seven Samurai. The film does not feature new ways of telling a story. But I think it is Kurosawas most human legacy in a body of work which is rich of statements on humanity. and human weaknesses and strengths. Looking at any list of current films in the cinemas today one can only wish there would be much more films like Red Beard. Films like that can influence the way we see the world, like the current films packed with violence already do. It would be a much better world for sure! I don't go so far as to single out any part of the story. I would wish every one would see the film as I did, knowing nothing about it except the title and the director. The film speaks for itself.

It was the last of his period costume dramas (excluding Ran and Kagemusha, though these were more of a glorious revisit to his 'old' style anyhow), the last film he shot in black and white, and the last film he ever made with Toshiru Mifune, thus ending what is, to me at least, the finest director-actor pairing in the history of cinema. Perhaps it is for these reasons that I look on this film with so much fondness, and it remains one of my favourite Kurosawa films (alongside Ran and Rashomon). That aside, it is also filled with warmth and sincerity, but then that's to be expected from the man I consider to be the greatest director of all time. Highly recommended.

It did, however, mark a turning point for me as it did for him.Up to then, I had only seen the B&W Samurai classics of the 50s and early 60s. The must-sees not just Seven Samurai, but Yojimbo and Throne of Blood. The under-appreciated Sanjuro, and the light but enduring Hidden Fortress. This was my first non-samurai film from him. What I did not realise until later was that it was his career apotheosis.Red Beard is not Kurosawa's best film. Yet when it came out, it was a phenomenon much like Titanic 30 years later. It broke the bank, it was an exercise in unprecedented creative and financial power by a major filmmaker, and it appealed to filmgoers like few filmes before or since. Kurosawa built a hospice and miniature village for his characters to inhabit, and this episodic story of a young star doctor discovering a vocation among the poor under the gruff red beard (Mifune) feels all the more authentic for it. It is a film of such deliberate ease and confidence that it could only be made by this director, at this point in his career. It could not be anything less than the fullest exploration of his most cherished themes - social injustice, the redemptive power of human kindness, personal codes. It could also do nothing but foreshadow his decline.That's a lot of expectation to pile onto the unsuspecting viewer, so what do you get during those 3 hours? You get a first-class drama, Mifune's finest performance, and one of the most beautiful tear-jerkers ever to grace a screen. All the while, countless instances of technical brilliance remind you why this film could only be made by this director a surgery covered in nothing but an extended closeup of the young doctor, an eerie seduction covered in an almost static, dreamlike wide shot, and, halfway through, the ass-kicking of a life-time and its touching follow-up.This is an extinct form of filmmaking, one preserved in the ember of its stark black-and-white film stock. The cinematic equivalent of a Tyrannosaurus Rex skeleton there are ways in which you won't relate, but it is daunting, powerful, and a journey into an intriguing other world well worth spending 3 hours in, and then some.

I have often done that. Although I cannot be absolutely certain, I'm inclined to choose Red Beard, with Hello Dolly and Judgement at Nuremberg as close contenders.If I am allowed to use only one word to describe this film, it will be warm. From Akahige flows a warmth that can be said to be almost uncharacteristic of Kurosawa, or at least much more palpable than in any other of his films. This warmth is particularly seen in his portrayal of the little people (borrowed fom Bob Hope in the 1971 Oscar Award), at which Kurosawa is very good. The best example is in a scene close to the end.To set the scene, the young doctor played by Yuzo Kayamo has almost completed his transformation from a sceptical, arrogant apprentice to a humane, loyal disciple under the eccentric but effective training of the head of the hospital played by Toshiro Mifune. In turn, the young doctor is now helping with the tranformation of a juvenile prostitute (rescued by Toshiro Mifune) from a neurotic patient into a normal person. The example I have in mind is an episode between this girl and a small boy who has been driven to theft by poverty.While the girl is well on her way to recovery and helping with manual work in the hospital, she has difficulty winning the acceptance of her co-workers. The episode started when they catch sight of the little boy trying to steal rice, but fail to stop him. In the following day, the girl managers to corner the little guy in the hospital. The conversation that ensues would break a heart of steel. What we see is two innocent children talking about poverty, hunger and life in a matter-of-course manner, without any wailing, without any bitterness, without even a trace of sadness. At the end, she tells him not to steal any more and promises to bring him some food the following day.Unknown to them, the conversation is heard by some of the girl's co-workers, who end up in quiet sobs. The next day, at lunch, the girl tries to get an extra bowl of rice. One of the women who did not hear the conversation takes it away from her, claiming that she does not need that much. Those who heard the conversation the day before immediately snatch the rice back for the girl, claiming that she is a growing child and needs a lot of food. The scene is actually quite funny, and will have you laughing, but with a lump in your throat and mist in your eyes.There is so much about this film and I won't go into details. I must mention however the wonderful music, which also has a feeling of warmth consistent with the film. In particular, there is a hauntingly beautiful little tune accompanying throughout the young doctor's untiring, patient and caring effort to help the girl recover from her traumatic experience.Toshiro Mifune put up one of his best performances. Yuzo Kayama, a most popular star/idol at that time (comparable to Tom Cruise at his hay days) played his role as a solid, down-to-earth actor. All the numerous supporting roles were extremely well cast. Most significant, however, are the very minor roles (such as the labour women mentioned before) that are equally captivating, leaving a deep impression in the audience's mind. Therein lies Kurosawa's greatness.

Although there were  beautifully choreographed action scenes still to come in Kagemusha and Ran, nothing was quite the same after this quiet meditation on the stirrings of humanity in a dark and otherwise uncaring world.  The period is early 19th century, the place a hospital for the socially impoverished run by a doctor who manages to combine idealism and pragmatism, the two essential ingredients needed to facilitate the emergence of enlightenment.  Although the great Toshiro Mifune dominates the film as the hospital head, it is the effect of his presence on the young doctor who pays him a visit that is the main theme of the narrative.  Yasumoto, selfish and ambitious, has no intention to begin with of devoting his services to the hospital but one by one his defences collapse as he learns from the example of an idealist who has shed all vestiges of selfishness.  There are constant reminders that medicine was at a rudimentary stage in its development and of the dedication needed by pioneers at a time when most answers still remained unknown and everything was largely a matter of easing rather than curing.  I would not claim that Red Beard is among Kurosawa's half dozen greatest works.  At just over three hours it sprawls in a discursive way.  A lengthy flashback of a dying patient's reasons for seeking a form of absolution rather impedes the narrative flow in spite of some impressive visuals of snowscapes and an earthquake.  But then the structure of the whole film rather has the episodic quality of a soap opera where momentum is maintained by proceeding from one crisis to another.  Nevertheless it is full of wonderfully contrasted sequences from the knockabout humour of Mifune applying his medical skills to warding off a group of assailants by breaking their limbs like matchsticks to the tender scene of the young doctor being nursed back from sickness by the girl rescued from enslavement in a brothel.  And then there is the rain.  Where would a Kurosawa film be without those torrential downpours to remind us of the physical discomfiture that a journey towards enlightenment entails.

It could be because the movie is 3 hours long, but it is probably more due to the skill of Akira Kurosawa and his meticulous craftsmanship.Some complaints of the film are that it is slow, too episodic, too much like TV medical dramas, it treats psychotherapy like the newfound Holy Grail (and in 1965 Japan it might have been), but the movie is so well done it doesn't really matter. Kurosawa considered 'Red Beard' his monument to the goodness of man, and it is inspiring in such a way.Toshiro Mifune is wonderfully restrained as 'Red Beard', but you know when he starts rubbing his chin, he's going to kick some ass, mostly verbally, but in one scene, physically; he beats the crap out of some thugs who don't want him to take a sick girl to his clinic. His character will cheat, lie and even charge exorbitant medical fees just to ensure goodness prevails and the patients of his medical clinic get the help they need. He also will speak his mind beyond that of a typical doctor; poor parents get chastised, the lazy rich get a dressing down, and even acknowledges that well-being is usually in the mind of the patient and sometimes the best doctor in the world cannot change that.As always, it's a shame Kurosawa and Mifune went their separate ways after this film, because they truly did bring out the best in one another.

Most of his previous work touched on this issue, especially Ikiru, but this would be the last. Afterwards, his films grew dark in their examination of human weakness, and unable to see a good future for mankind. They also lost the talent of Toshiro Mifune; this too would be his last appearance in a Kurosawa film.The story is simple, almost elementary in its convention. In early 19th century Japan, the young, na√Øve doctor Yasumoto (Yuzo Kayama) comes to work in a free health clinic. He accepts his post grudgingly, judging his surroundings to be beneath him. Through the instruction of an older doctor, the wise Red Beard (Mifune), and exposure to human suffering around him, he grows up and finds his place in the world of medicine. Although the plot seems predictable, the human emotion Kurosawa discovers is not.Each episode of the movie feels alive with emotion, alive with sorrow and with hope. Although the story surrounds Yasumoto with human suffering, it is not about suffering, but about learning step by step to find compassion. As we journey with Yasumoto through the story, we are also the ones being challenged.Modern life bombards us suffering on a global scale. We read headlines from around the world, know statics on poverty, wars, genocides, and natural disasters. We see the overwhelming tide of human weakness, and feel duly overwhelmed. Yet, it felt so refreshing to see a film with characters who did not know the statics, who only knew the hurting people in front of them. I felt challenged to know people the same way.

It is uncomplicated and deep and highly regarded by many because of its accessibility and the high level of craft made obvious. But there is a deep problem here.One should say at the outset that even a problematic film by Kurosawa is still worth more than nearly everything else that enters the popular stream. But there was a reason Kurosawa collapsed after this. There is a reason it marks the end of an era.Kurosawa's anchor mastery is that he not only knows his way around the three disciplines of film (writing, dealing with actors, creating a vision), he knows how to fuse them. The more abstract the center of the story-vision, the more complete that fusion. But as his fame grew with his value to the studio, he came under greater pressure to be accessible and in this case he chose to explicitly moralize.That is where the disaster is rooted. In the past (and later) he was able to start with visual notions and build everything around that the story, the noh-centric acting (except in terms of immediacy), and of course the moving frame we see. But this time, he reaches further than ever into the lowest common denominator of popular life. And unfortunately for us, that territory is exclusively literary. He borrows from Yamamoto and Dostoyevsky and gives us a series of episodes whose points we get, but by getting them, we place ourselves in a literary place in our mind, not a visual one.In other words, what makes him important is his ability to invest images with narrative. Go back and look at some of his early films with no sound or subtitles. You can completely get it. The words are only there to mollify our brain. Now flash forward to this. What we have is an illustrated book, where all the narrative motion is in the spoken exposition. The difference in center is startling.No question that the pictures are still masterful. Still highly formal in composition and more importantly in the motion of the camera. But the pictures are now in service to the story (the way more mundane directors work) rather than the other way around. One still marvels at the eye, especially the shot where the new doctor is engaged with the mad woman, but at the same time, one grieves that the Master has lost his center.What's left is a long, slow journey back to the triumph of `Ran,' made ever so more important because of this voyage of the creative soul to recapture itself. Just as depicted in that film.Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 4 Worth watching.

There are also some trademark flourishes from the director, such as the sideways screen-wipes, which lead us from one scene to another like the sliding-across of a Japanese door. What took some getting used to for me was the absence of the samurai themes that crop up again and again in his most widely renowned films. Red Beard certainly lacks some of the urgency in Kurosawa's best-known films, proceeding at a stately pace in nearly three hours running time.Throughout the film we witness a series of episodes that shed light on the lives of the patients suffering within the walls of the hospital. The film is often grim and on occasion graphic in detail but the stories that are recounted, from the last moments of a voiceless man to the incarceration of a mad, murderous young woman, are powerfully compelling. Furthermore, from these episodes there emerges the overarching narrative of the arrogant young doctor learning from the taciturn veteran. The final episode involving the rescue of Otoyo and the fate of the boy thief, is the most fully developed of the episodes within the film and in itself delivers moments of both intense joy and tragedy.In a definite nod to the martial roles usually played by Toshiro Mifune, his character, Red Beard, is involved in one spectacular melee during the film, which had me wincing one moment and laughing out loud the next. By and large, however, immediate gratification does not abound and I would urge patience with the slow, episodic approach in order to appreciate this fine film.

In the case of Red Beard, he was appalled at the number of poor quality ultra-violent Samurai flicks being churned out in the wake of his own recent action pictures, Yojimbo (1961) and Sanjuro (1963). As a backlash he decided to make a period picture with a peaceful, non-action theme, more of a pure drama. Furthermore, in an abandonment of the cynicism which had marked all his films from The Bad Sleep Well (1960) onwards, he declared that Red Beard was to be a tribute to the goodness in humanity. There is nothing wrong with this is a basis for a film &#150; it's just that Kurosawa tries too hard.Kurosawa was, or at least had been a director who handled emotional moments with skill. Consider for example the terminally ill hero in Ikiru (1952) drunkenly singing in the bar, or Kikuchiyo rescuing the baby in Seven Samurai (1954). Bearing these past triumphs in mind it's almost painful to see how he fails completely to achieve the same effect in Red Beard. Here the audience is practically bombarded with moments of strained poignancy. There is absolutely no subtlety, as one heavy-handed sob story after another is cranked out.The problem is further compounded by the fact that Red Beard is structured as a series of short stories with the same setting, as patients come and go at the hospital. It's really very difficult to share any feeling with the characters because we never really get to know them &#150; we just hear about their past misery. Whenever characters cry (which happens all the time), it's difficult for the audience to connect to them. Eventually all the stories of grief and woe just start to sound ridiculous.Of course, there is one overarching storyline, that of the young doctor Yasumoto's transformation from being a selfish snob who resents having to treat poor people, to a dedicated professional who takes satisfaction in his work. This is for me the most satisfying and engaging part of the plot. The most uplifting moment in the film is when Yasumoto wears his uniform for the first time, and is immediately greeted with greater respect from both colleagues and patients.And, in spite of his poor judgement with the plot, Kurosawa's direction is still of good standard and there are plenty of marks of quality. He matches the warm, sensitive tone of the film with a delicate approach to his shot composition, and a slow and measured pace to each scene. In the first half of the film, he shows Yasumoto's feelings about having to work at the clinic by shooting the interiors in such a way that they appear cramped and confining. When Yasumoto dons his uniform the spaces begin to open out and a little more light is let in. There's also a sly nod towards Kurosawa and Mifune's earlier pictures in the film's only real action sequence. It's choreographed just like the frantic arm-chopping scene from Yojimbo, but rather than drawing a sword Mifune is instead twisting limbs and cracking bones in a completely bloodless fight.It's a pity that this was Mifune's swansong with Kurosawa, not just because it's a poorer film, but also because Mifune is somewhat sidelined to a secondary role (in spite of being the titular character), and it's not a performance where he really gets to flourish. While Mifune continued to be much in demand as an actor he only had a few memorable roles after this. Kurosawa's output slowed down considerably after Red Beard and it would be a long time before he was back on top form.

The great script is sprawling and, in the hands of a lesser mortal, could have turned into a sentimental or even maudlin mess. Like many of AK's pieces starring Mifune, the story is essentially an ensemble work. We are lead into patient's case histories and their life stories (one of which even goes into flashback within flashback). Dr Niide aka Red Beard seems to be half-healer, half psychoanalyst, as he see into men's hearts.Something no other reviewer has yet commented on is the humour. Yes, this is serious drama, but contain plenty of laughs. Right from the opening scene, where the horrified medical graduate is taken, step by depressing step, into the place he has been tricked into taking and the trap which will prevent him from escape, you really feel his growing anxiety, and the buildup is very funny in a grim sort of way. Then there's the scene where Kurosawa does a brief Bruce Lee impression, systematically breaking the limbs of a gang of toughs who try to prevent him taking a sick you girl out of a brothel. The hilarious part is what follows, as RB loudly berates himself for acting in a manner not suited to one of his profession, and that perhaps he went a bit too far. You've just gotta see this scene to fully appreciate it. And there are more.As we've come to expect from AK, the acting is uniformly excellent. Particularly chilling was the mad woman, in the short scene where she enters the young doctor's room. Slowly, we are show why she was nicknamed The Mantis. And the girl who plays Otoyo is just as good (and what happened to her ? IMDb records only one other film for her).Criticisms ? Only minor ones. This film could be read as a cliched triumph of the human spirit saga, and the ending especially leans a bit on the syrupy side. If you lost concentration for awhile, the sprawl of the story might get you a bit lost.But don't let this put you off. This is a truly great film, and a definite must-see.

It involves a young, self-centered doctor with connections, who is about to be a personal physician to the Shogunate. As it turns out, through a series of circumstance (especially one involving an engagement) he finds himself in a clinic, asked to treat the lowest of the low, a squalid, almost sickening place. He postures and spits out his disdain, refusing to work and confronting his superior, called Red Beard, played by Toshiro Mifune. After many incidents where he is called into near death experiences, he begins to see the sadness, particularly in the rescue of a twelve year old girl from a brothel. In modern times we would say she is suffering from PTSD. She is silent from being beaten and will talk to no one. She is very ill and is taken to the clinic where the young man is given the task of making her well. She suffers through her own recovery and then takes on the task of watching over the young doctor who, himself, has fallen ill. The movie is often about her as much as him as she grows to be compassionate of others instead of resisting any sort of kindness. An attempted suicide by a poor family brings an ultimate decision. Of course, I'm not a film student, but the images are stunning. The bleakness of the every day lives of the patients and their caretakers. The world as a harsh and desperate place. Red Beard embraces this and makes the world his, despite opportunities that would bring him comfort. In the young man, we see a reaffirmation of his own life.

Filming took 2 years, and being a period drama the sets were built with the kind of wood and nails used in that era. Toshiro Mifune had to grow a beard and keep it during shooting, thus losing many role offers and resulting in financial difficulties for his own production company. Red Beard is the last of Kurosawa's black and white movies, and the final movie of the 16 film collaborations between Mifune and Kurosawa (Where they stood remained ambivalent, yet something of a reconciliation happened between them at Director. Ishiro Honda's funeral in 1993, ending three decades of mutual avoidance).A somewhat, arrogant young doctor is accidentally assigned to a rural clinic after aspiring to be the personal physician of the Shogunate. During his time there he meets the elderly Dr. Kyoj≈ç Niide (Toshiro Mifune), who behind his gruff exterior and demanding attitude is actually a very caring man with a sense of community. The young doctor also encounters and delves into the various life's of each patient, who all have very emotionally raw human tales of existentialism.In many ways Red Beard is Kurosawa's underrated gem. There's a wonderfully large cast of all age groups, and also features some of Kurosawa's most stunning scenes of human interaction. Patience is a virtue, everyone has a story to tell and social injustices of the time are tackled honestly regardless of how brutal. Toshiro Mifune's character is also downplayed a lot, which actually benefits everyone else's screen time and makes it all feel like the movie wasn't driven just by a renowned actor.Final Verdict Even after all those production problems, Red Beard is a heartwarming and somewhat affirming hospital drama that holds up wonderfully. 9/10.

It doesn't have a strong plot, but instead focuses on particular characters for short periods of time (same as his Dodes'ka-den and The Lower Depths). It centers around a clinic director training a young doctor. Some of the more interesting patients are a woman who kills men after having seduced them (therefore earning the nickname Mantis), a sick boy with a worried family and a girl getting rescued from a brothel. It's based on Sh≈´gor≈ç Yamamoto's short story collection Akahige shinry≈çtan, but borrows Otoyo's subplot from Dostoevsky's The Insulted and the Injured. It was Kurosawa's last film with Mifune and his last B&W picture.The first hour of Red Beard is absolute gold, managing to be immersive, intense and entertaining at the same time. I particularly adore the scene where The Mantis tries to kill Yasumoto, it's just fantastically shot, acted and put together - one of Kurosawa's best scenes by far. Other noteworthy moments include the part when Mifune beats up a bunch of thugs (even when playing a doctor he gets to kick ass), and of course the well shot. However, the rest of the movie is boring as hell, and sometimes too discursive, bringing up some interesting subplots and later abandoning them (such as with The Mantis). It's needlessly too long for such a simple story (it lasts 3 hours) and way too slow. The worst part is by far the 30-minute how I met my wife flashback. I also think that the movie looks really dull in B&W. I know that color was probably unavailable/too expensive, but I don't think that this is the type of movie to go along nicely in black and white. I mean, it'd be nice to actually see the main character's red beard in color (that beard pretty much ended the Kurosawa-Mifune cooperation because Mifune couldn't work on any other project because of that beard he had for this film).Red Beard showcased Kurosawa's attention to detail more so than any other feature of his. I mean, the clinic drawers were stock-filled of pills and medical equipment of the 19th century, true to its time period. Of course this had to cost a lot, but Kurosawa stuck with it. The drawers are never even opened or mentioned.

The climax of the first half, when the gruff doctor resorts to mass violence for the sake of one mentally-scarred individual, is as good as any showdown in a typical Toshiro Mifune samurai movie, and all the better because of the great reluctance of Mifune's character to resolve problems with force. Like another revisionist samurai movie of the era, Harakiri (1962), Akahige relies on exaggerated hard-luck stories to make its point. Yet the vignettes here are more artistic than any in Harakiri, as when wind chimes drown out the sound of a marketplace when a husband realizes a wife's secret.

Akahige is seriously way beyond typical Kurosawa films (except Ikiru) because it is so heavy to watch. The level of emotional, humane influence projected is unexpected from an old classic and is on par with some of the heaviest tear-jerking films I have seen. This film is fundamentally one of those 'lessons in life' masterpieces and I cannot help but shed tears like every 15 min because the stories from the patients, staff and families connected to those patients are just beyond heart-breaking. I am also surprised that some elements are presented way beyond his time, for instance the suspense and the performance by a 'nymphomaniac' approaching the apprentice's life is as good as any modern psychological thriller. Not to say that I am being biased, but really I cannot find any faults in this movie too.Why this film is memorable - One of the very very selective few films since Joy Luck Club that made me cry so much...thanks to overwhemingly touching stories that gave way to the following points - the acting performance of a dying patient suffering from pancreas cancer. One of the best I have seen. -Sahachi's words to change the apprentice's rebellious nature of not wanting to wear uniforms 'please wear the uniforms. If u do, we will know that u are a doctor. Poor people like us cannot afford doctors and will b extremely happy to see one.' - The suicide act of Onaka -- something I have not come across in non-Japanese films, because, ironically, it wasn't that depressing as she kills herself in Sahachi's embrace - Sahachi's stretched-out hands right before his death - Red Beard's attempts to feed a 'rebellious' teenage girl who was actually traumatized for a long time. WOW, that's a superb presentation of such profound understanding of another's hidden torment. - After realising Chobo's heartbreaking story, Otoyo accepted the candies stolen by the boy for her sake but forced him to take them back to feed his siblings. Wonderful. - The 'yelling down to the well' act. Its more beautiful than any other form of prayers shown in other movies because it is a maximum presentation of a simple, desperate act of hope. - A very UNUSUAL point to add Red Beard's attempt to disable (and in the end amputated) the limbs of his assailants just to save Otoyo from her despair.

The music is hauntingly beautiful also, at its best in the first major death scene, and the story while not the most original or most accessible of Kurasawa's films continues to fascinate. Standout scenes, tense, full of humanity or whatnot, include the action scene, with a nice mix of humour and brilliant sound effects, the Mantis preying on Yasamoto, Sahachi's tale of his wife and the culmination in the well.

To his surprise, his family have gone against his wishes and placed him in a rural clinic, under the guidance of Red Beard, a strict but compassionate doctor. At first, he is appalled at what he see's and rebels, refusing to wear the uniform or work. Through his experiences at the clinic, the young doctor learns the true meaning of life. The film examines the doctors relationships with various patients and more importantly, his relationship with Red Beard, a hardened veteran of a doctor who imparts his wisdom on to him. The daily struggles at the clinic force the trainee doctor to re-evaluate how he see's himself, he learns of the true power a doctor holds, he can make a huge difference in peoples lives if he wanted to and bring happiness to the less fortunate. A life of poverty is worth having if he can make a difference to numerous lives.Even by Kurosawa's standards, this was quite a sentimental film. One of Kurosawa's trademarks was to use extreme examples of society to get his message across and this film is no different. Another one of his obsessions was existential humanism, which was in full force in this film. Despite the harshness of poverty displayed, 'Red Beard' gives hope and paints a rather positive picture of the human race, especially through the character of Red Beard. It also marked his last collaboration with Mifune, his films after this would paint more of a bleak picture of society. Mifune played the part with a subtle sort of intensity, a far cry from his usually angry Samurai roles. It really was an excellent performance. In one particularly great scene, Red Beard dismantles a bunch of thugs in Steven Seagal-esquire fight scene, he uses his knowledge of the human body to fracture certain bones in their body. After this scene, he evaluates and damage he's done and realises he was too harsh, he proceeds by patching up their injuries. The protagonist also gives an admirable performance, displaying all the traits necessary for a complex individual who undergoes a miraculous change by the end of the film. A special mention goes to the child actors who were simply superb, one scene near the end was especially moving and I think it even made me shed a tear or two.Another masterpiece from Kurosawa and for me, it firmly places him as the greatest film maker of all time.

I could go into all the reasons why, but it's best that if you like Red Beard you also give these other films a try--you won't be disappointed.The film is much like many of Kurosawa's films in that the importance of the peasant is the focus of the movie. The value of these people is strongly emphasized--despite a feudal society that saw them as expendable. Through the use of a haughty young doctor from a rich family who arrives at Red Beard's combination clinic/hospital, the director is able to show the nobility of the poor. The young man's opinions change towards these people he previously thought were beneath him as he is forced to make rounds in the hospital and surrounding community. Seeing men die, women getting operated on without anesthesia and the degradation of the poor has a strong effect on the young man--and the audience as well. Interestingly, however, despite Toshiro Mifune being the star, he is a shadowy figure through much of this film--appearing and disappearing for long stretches of the film. Instead, the film really is about this young doctor's journey and the effect the unorthodox Mifune has upon him.Speaking of unorthodox, I loved some of Mifune's strange techniques to help the poor. In particular, I loved the great fight scene at brothel where he took on a gang of thugs to save one young girl as well as the way he occasionally used extortion on his rich patients in order to gain funds for his hospital!

As the film progresses the young doctor chafes against the rules but along with the audience he also gradually begins to develop a greater understanding of his mentor. Although there is considerably more to the film, the most important theme as I see it is what it means to be a compassionate and dedicated caregiver.A deceptively straight forward film which on the surface as a collection of parts does not seemingly add up to the wonderful viewing experience I had. The performances are universally good, and while the film does not lend itself to the obvious powerful moments of a movie about conflict there are still comparable moments and more time for subtle development. A story about dedicated doctors is not an entirely original concept either but placed at a time when modernization of the processes is taking place this film presents a seldom seen perspective. Without the dynamic action so often associated with Kurosowa the visual elements are less obvious and less important, none the less it is still obviously the work of a master film maker.Although I can't claim to have seen all of Kurosowa's films, of those that I have seen this one ranks second only to The Seven Samurai in my personal enjoyment.This would be Kurosowa's last Black and White film and also sadly his last collaboration with his star Toshiro Mifune.

The film takes nearly all of the supporting characters through incredible odds and shows their toughness and strength to overcome hard times they all face. It is perhaps his most humanistic film since Ikiru and his best of the 1960s. The acting supersedes most American films today by a large margin and Kurosawa continues to show is mastering of the many camera techniques he uses to tell the story in a fashionable manner.

Its opening credits music is periodically paused for the ambient sounds of the health clinic, one of the many things Kurosawa does that is sudden but subtle. Those three words are the aphorism that best describes Kurosawa.Through a three-part first act and a two-part second act, the film takes place in the 19th century. A young doctor named Yasumoto, played by a very able actor named Yuzo Kayama, is the protagonist, portrayed with an uncanny, lifelike pride. Educated in Dutch medical schools, the conceited Yasumoto aims to the prestige of personal physician of the Shogunate. For Yasumoto's post-graduate medical training, he has been transferred to a countryside clinic under the leadership of a clinic director aptly nicknamed Red Beard, played by Toshiro Mifune in a tremendous performance, seeming like a domineering tyrant, however it is easy to see that in truth he is a kindhearted clinic leader. At the outset of the movie, Yasumoto is up in arms about his relocation, judging beyond a shadow of a doubt that he has not much to reap from working under Red Beard, whom he believes is merely interested in his medical writings and almost immediately defies the clinic director. He rejects his uniform and turns his nose up at the food and simple surroundings.In a scene of tension that one could cut with a pairing knife, Yasumoto crosses into the prohibited garden in which he encounters The Mantis, in a mysterious and brimming performance by Kyoko Kagawa, an enigmatic patient that no one but Red Beard can doctor. This scene is a long, unbroken stationary shot that will pour inspiration and enlightenment into any aspiring filmmaker. In one of the film's most emotional chapters, Yasumoto, subsequent to falling ill, is nurtured to health by the tending and warmth of a 12 year old girl who he and Red Beard have saved from a brothel in a spectacularly entertaining scene involving a choreographed fight that no matter how unexpected is not one bit incongruous.In the course of his interpretation of Red Beard's empathy and a chain of impoverished patients, Dr. Yasumoto gathers the most precious knowledge he could ever ascertain as a doctor. The lives of patients slowly become more valuable than prosperity or reputation. Through the film's vignettes, he studies Red Beard and thus so do we, and we see his unapologetically spartan philosophy, that their misery can be improved and even revolutionized with kindness and reliable attention. Kurosawa, unlike most of the great directors, is much more interested in the hero and the essential study of a good person rather than empathy of their flaws, much like what fascinates Scorsese, PT Anderson or Fritz Lang. Kurosawa is an unaffected portrait of a hero, not so much a character who has flaws, but a misunderstood spiritual teacher to the characters and the audience. He sees illness, in its deepest form, as a disorder of the soul, originating as an effect of the tortured heart or mind. He rejects the idea of a political solution to health care, though he is frustrated with the disdain politics show to the pain of those it controls. He finds a more timeless cure for his horribly ailing patients, though many may suffer and die. Yet the stages they go through to their death or survival are astoundingly drastic.The swiftness with which Toshiro Mifune conveyed and emoted is amazing. The average actor may perhaps need much more time and space in a given scene to communicate an impression than Mifune did. The promptness of his actions is such that he alleged in a solitary, distinct movement or facial expression what takes many classically trained actors a lot longer to squeeze out. He presents everything without delay and unflinchingly, and his awareness of pace was the sort I am sure any director would have longed for dearly, because he was entirely in sync with Kurosawa, perhaps because their minds were so uncannily alike. And still with all his timing and sharpness, he as well possessed startlingly perceptive and beautiful feelings. He had to! Otherwise, what would all of that precision mean?

Kurosawa is probably my favorite all time director, but I have found that some of his 2+ hour movies tend to get a little long in the tooth before all is said and done (excepting the superb Seven Samurai.) However, I was pleasantly surprised. This film is a delight. I was truly moved by the story of the cynical young doctor who gradually learns to care for his patients, under the tutelage of a stern but caring elder, played by Mifune. The first major death scene is truly extraordinary, and is surely on the short list of Kurosawa's most memorable ( the music plays loudly as a sick man lifts his head up one last time. He is in a dark room but the light shines on his face at that moment. It is magnificent.) I think Mifune was very capable as the elder doctor, and I disagree with Steven Prince's commentary, in which he claimed that Shimura would have done a better job with certain scenes, in particular one where the doctor is (unsuccessfully) trying to give a young child medicine. For sure, Shimura would have been more natural at it, but that was part of the charm, that Mifune was playing against type, and that the doctor himself had to make an effort to tamp down his enormous energies and tap into his caring side. The second half of the film is dominated by the young doctor, a young girl, and an even younger boy, as Mifune virtually disappears. However, it continues to fascinate, as we track the young doctor's immersion with a single patient, who in turn regains her humanity by caring for him when he is sick, and helping the young (hungry) boy in his desperate situation.In short, I cannot recommend this film highly enough, esp. for the Kurosawa admirer. Perhaps Ikiru, Akahige, and Ran, are respectively Kurosawa's three most comprehensive statements about man as a whole (although all his films are about the state of man alone and with others, Rashomon, High and Low, I Live in Fear for example), and Akahige, I believe, is his peak in terms of his humanistic vision of what man is capable of and can evolve to be. This is his last film with Mifune, as is well known. A fitting statement for both men, although it would have been interesting to see what Mifune could have done as Hidetora in Ran.

This experience of crying for joy had once been quite alien to me. And now I realize it was because I wasn't watching the right movies.

But, of course, that is not all the movie has to offer. There are quite a few unforgettable scenes. And Mifune in the role of Red Beard re-reminds you of his versatility and incredible skill. This is the last collaboration between Kurosawa and Mifune, and it is a sad departure. They are both at the height of their talents, and it is unfortunate they couldn't draw out the pure pleasure of that combination for just a few more films. It itself is enough to make you cry. And even if not every moment of the movie will have you in tears, the movie overall will stick you in the ribs with some powerful feelings. You will understand when you see the movie how a director can hold you in his hand for so long, how he can re-affirm your faith in humanity and not make it corny or sentimental, how he can moralize and not detract from its depth, and how he can do all this with such effortless grace.

With Red Beard, his final collaboration with Toshiro Mifune, he unravels from a previous novel a story with many little stories, connected with the idea that people can be devoted to helping people. Many people take for granted what doctors can do, besides the straight-forward medical side of things. They can also help bring people out of the dark into the light, or closest to it. While this may be looked upon with some skepticism and cynicism in the modern age, what's fascinating is that Red Beard is a modern film, with a timeless sensibility. It's a film shot in black and white, but it deals with characters that will always be out there, the good and the bad, the under-privileged and those who are not.But besides the themes that Kurosawa and his writers have underneath, he tells an interesting, if somewhat familiar, story of the young being brought into a world by the experienced. Dr. Yamamoto (Kuzo Kaywama) doesn't think he will work at the clinic run by Dr. Niide (Red Beard), and at first does everything in his power to resist doing anything. But then he gets drawn in bit by bit, starting with an encounter with a mentally-damaged woman (Ky√¥ko Kagawa, who assists in making their one scene one of Kurosawa's absolute best), and observes Red Beard at work. Sometimes it's too much, but he does begin to understand what he hasn't realized yet as a doctor. Then, when a girl (Miyuki Kuwano) is struck with a fever under a repressive mother, Yamamoto takes her under his care, leading into the second half of the film.It would be one thing if Kurosawa decided to focus squarely on the relationship between Niide and Yamamoto, but because he is more interested in certain stories with the patients, so is the audience. Like a sewer, Kurosawa weaves delicately all of these little bits into the film, and often using powerful light measures in certain shots (some of which, when a dying character, Rokusuke, is shown in a flashback in CU, or when another character, Sahachi, recalls a story involving his wife, are tiny masterpieces of composition). And it's not necessarily tragic the entire way either- one scene involving a fight with Red Beard and some thugs brings out a purely comical excursion in the film. If one of the director's (not just Kurosawa but in general) is to cast with a keen eye, then this film doesn't miss out- nearly every small role is fit so one can't see it being cast any other way.Mifune, when he is on-screen, is compelling as always, but not in the same manic way he was in some of his earlier acting roles. Here he reacts calmly sometimes, attentively, and when his emotion comes through, he doesn't do the yelling and lightning fast delivery. His character, which he fits into beautifully, is far more wary of the ways of the world than some of his samurai parts were. As for the younger counterpart, Yamamoto, played by Kayawa, he is performed with the right levels in how the character transforms- frustrated, shocked, observant, understanding, caring, sympathetic. And there are other parts that are played without a note missed- Onaka, played by Kuwano, is perhaps the Japanese equivalent to what Jodie Foster was in her youth- determined, believable, and of course vulnerable. There is a tendency for some Japanese actors to take it a little to far into the over-reaching, but her work here is far from that.I was emotionally moved by Red Beard, and in a way that some films just can't do. Some films overpower with melodrama to mark its points. Red Beard delves into questions that those other films (which may or may not have fine emotional content) wouldn't raise. There is an underlying current in the story that the clinic is under-funded for Red Beard. He cannot fathom why this is so, not that they can't get the money they need to treat the under-privileged, but why the under-privileged are there in the first place. But then with the film, the questions coincide well with the dramatic structure and catharsis pulled by the end. It's a typical kind of conclusion, but it's worthy of such. One of Kurosawa's better films; not one to start with if you're not familiar with the director's film, yet a treat for those ready for a three-hour trip into a world we know and don't know at once.

His influence can stretch to George Lucas and his epic Star Wars which garnered its inspiration and structure from Kurosawa's Hidden Fortress. Another director who has attributed much in his career to Kurosawa is Martin Scorsese (who gives a cameo as Vincent van Gogh in Yume &#150; Kurosawa's Dreams).Scorsese's movie Taxi Driver details the story of a troubled anti-hero named Travis Bickle disgusted with the conditions of the city he lives in. He ends up saving a young 12-year old prostitute from the pimps who have begun to run her life. This aspect of the movie can be attributed to Kurosawa's influence on Scorsese and is seen in the film Red Beard. In Kurosawa's film a young man who is upset with where he is at in his life (much like Travis Bickle) decides to save a young geisha who is entrapped by a cruel master; who is echoed by Harvey Keitel's character in Taxi Driver. The young girl is the same exact age as Iris in Scorsese's film as well.One of Red Beards most important cinematic themes is the rescue of this girl and her realization that there is better to life. No other film seems to depict this Kurosawa theme better than Taxi Driver. The young geisha goes through a transformation under the young man's care and begins to understand life and how precious it can be. This is echoed by Iris who goes back to school and goes back the life suggested by her liberator Travis.

His films epitomize humanism, especially the ambiguity of human experience and the need to know thyself. This theme appears in its essence form in Rashomon, but is at the heart of such diverse films as Stray Dog, Seven Samurai and Yojimbo. The aspect of Kurosawa's art that perhaps I most admire is the cohesion, as plot and characterizations develop seamlessly, whether in the relatively short Rashomon or in the longer Ran and Kagemusha. That is what I miss most in Red Beard. The earlier film which comes closest in theme is the much shorter The Lower Depths, in which the individual stories of the members of a slum community are artfully interwoven, and one comes to understand the needs of each one of the seven or eight principal characters. By contrast, Red Beard seems to fall into sections, not all of which have clear relevance to the framework narrative of the young doctor who comes of age under the guidance of a gruff but benevolent senior. After I had viewed the film I had the impression that I had seen a number of weekly episodes of an expertly directed television drama series, some reasonably absorbing, others over extended. I would suppose that the intention was to show how the young doctor matures from being self-centered and ambitious to serve a wealthy shogun, then after his has seen an assortment of human needs, to being compassionate and dedicated to serving the poor. Many of the performances are excellent, especially that of Yamamoto as the young doctor. For whatever reason, Mifune seems almost to be walking through what is for him an atypical role, one that perhaps did not allow him to convey the intensity he brought to roles in Stray Dog, Rashomon and Seven Samurai three very different films, in which his charisma almost literally jumps of the screen, as with the foremost Hollywood and European stars such as Bogart and Gabin. In some of Red Beard's episodes Kurosawa shows his mastery in creating sympathy for the human condition; however, adding the parts does not necessarily produce a satisfactory whole.

Regretibly, it lacks the delicate emotional control that kept powerful films from slipping into melodrama. There are many moments in Akahige which feel insincere and crafted for eliciting an emotional response- something one much less frequently feels when watching the detached study of human pathos and perseverance in Kurosawa's Ikiru. This lack of dramatic control mars what is otherwise an exquisitely staged, acted, and photographed production- but it is still an excellent film.In spite of its lenght (some three hours) it is an excellent film for introducing Kurosawa to a new viewer. The plot is rich without being complicated, the acting is almost always proficient, and the pacing never drags. Nevertheless, one who is new to Kurosawa should regard this film as hinting at the true power and majesty of Kurosawa films like Seven Samurai, Ikiru, Ran and the plain good fun of The Hidden Fortress, Yojimbo and Sanjuro as well as hinting at the skills that went into making technically brilliant films like Rashomon and The Lower Depths.It is my opinion that, except for Ran, Akahige was Kurosawa's last really great film- though I have not seen Kagemusha. Particluarly during his last decade, Kurosawa just could not seem to recapture his dramatic sensibilities and the films of that period seemed particularly lifeless. I can't blame Kurosawa for this- he represented a type of film making that was no longer fashionable in the mid-sixties. Akahige was huge and technically daunting- it took years to shoot and was the most expensive film yet produced in Japan. The strain of production not only distracted attention from the dramatic integrity of the film, it also finished off the already ailing relationship between Kurosawa and Toho Studios- Kurosawa's long-time backer who funded most of his best films. After Akahige, Kurosawa's life was never the same. He never had quite the same callibre of collaboration in creating and producing his movies. Not only did he not enjoy the same direct help, but, also, he could no longer rely upon the confident voices of disagreement and dissent in his older crews which helped him stay on track dramatically as well as technically.Also, here, we see Toshiro Mifune in a role that was a little too big and complicated for him- requiring more subtlety than he was really able to deliver. He still tries hard and frequently succeeds- but the role also plainly eludes him at times. This would be his last film with Kurosawa and while he is not at his best, he is still quite good- more as a presence than as a dramatic actor. This film is a sort of ensemble performance so don't expect to attach yourself to a particular character- even Yashumoto- the film's main character who really starts out a little too bratty and detached for the viewer to freely sympathize with him.In concluding, I can sum up by saying that the film aspires to greatness but falls short. But, as is often the case, aspiring for greatness and failing often means that one must settle merely for quite quite good instead.
