[{"Title":"Solid And Curiously Touching Modern Noir","Date":"1 November 2003","Score":"53 out of 59 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Crime, Drama","Review":" ROMEO IS BLEEDING is a fascinating and unusual hybrid of highly personalized old fashioned 40s noir and ultra-violent stylized 90s crime drama. It's the kind of movie they never make anymore, with an unappealing protagonist, an entirely corrupt universe where justice and virtue won't triumph and a heartbreaking ending which basically guaranteed it would never be a commercial hit. Obviously some were put off by these things, accounting for the low rating this minor masterpiece sleeper has. Bur that's part of why I love it!While there is significant man's man violence and the obvious titillation from Lena Olin, this movie is at its heart a pure noir cautionary tale carefully structured to get us to the amazingly powerful payoff, which tops all. The writer (Hilary Henkin) is obviously knowledgeable about her 40s and 50s hard boiled repertoire and fills ROMEO with references and touches which students of the genre will enjoy.But the center of this movie is Gary Oldman. His blisteringly desperate performance as a corrupt cop at the end of the long slide to oblivion defines the movie and is both hypnotic and disturbing. His voiceovers are a worthy throwback to the old Raymond Chandler raps voiced by Bogart or Dick Powell or Robert Montgomery. This isn't a nice or likable character but Oldman is believably relatable as he inexorably tries to feed the hole with his greed and inevitably circles the existential drain.Lena Olin is at her menacing best; this is surely the role which landed her the gig as Sidney's subtly venomous mother in ALIAS, and she takes full advantage of the over-the-top femme fatale characterization with deadly verve. Oldman and Olin share a bizarre chemistry which is fortunate for the script, because Olin's repeated seductions of Oldman (where he basically knows she is luring him to his doom) would never have worked if the actors didn't bring it to life on the screen. There aren't a lot of actresses who can out-menace Gary Oldman but Lena Olin absolutely pulls it off.ROMEO IS BLEEDING is not perfect. Roy Scheider's mafioso character is strangely caricatured and sticks out in a world otherwise occupied by three dimensional players. Scheider tries hard, too, which is a shame because it's just not there in the role. Lena Olin's brazen escape from police custody defies plausibility in the extreme. Gary Oldman is seemingly not quite properly motivated at all times. Nevertheless, the searing denouement to this movie burns all of these concerns away because it is one of the most unexpectedly poignant and heartrending in the last quarter century of noir. If you have a pulse, you will well up at the end, and probably think about a longing that you left behind at some point in your life against your wishes. 9 / 10 "},{"Title":"Outrageously Entertaining!","Date":"13 October 2005","Score":"53 out of 64 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Crime, Drama","Review":" Probably everyone has one favorite movie that they consider their own because few, if any, of their friends share their admiration for it. Mine is this one. I just love this film.It is only one out of over 5,000 movies have either rented or purchased that I watched back-to-back nights after seeing it for the first time. A dozen viewings later, It's still just as good, if not better. It is, start-to-finish, the most entertaining crime movie I have ever watched.Being of fan of film noir, those wonderfully-narrated crime films of the '40s and '50s, Romeo Is Bleeding is right up my alley. I may be wrong but believe this whole film is simply a parody of the film noirs an outrageous take on those movies with an over-the-top villain (Lena Olin, the most fascinating female I have ever come across on film), along with over-the-top characters, action scenes, dialog and narration. It's a wild, fun - albeit sick - ride, not to be taken seriously (which a lot of people did and then thought it was too goofy). Evidence of this film-noir spoof is in the dialog, with a number of fantastic dark-humor lines, many delivered by Olin. One has to see this a number of times to catch all the humor in here. Kudos to screenplay writer Hilary Henkin for her work.Oldman is superb and its the glue that holds this unique story in tact. His narration, including the exaggerated inflection in his voice, is fantastic. I appreciate the American accent this British actor used, too. Olin, as Russian hit- woman Mona Demarkoff, she is one character I guarantee you will not ever forget. Roy Scheider, Annabella Sciorra, Juliette Lewis, Michael Wincott and others - cameos by Dennis Farina and Ron Perlman - all deliver great performances with lines that, well,....as I said, are outrageous. If you love the old film noirs, please check this movie out and remember it's tongue-and-cheek.

What a mesmerizing movie! Gary Oldman is terrific as a corrupt Detective. You get the feeling from this guy that he was probably once a young, idealistic, honest cop, who has just been slowly manipulated, and seduced by the seaminess, the money, the sex, the despair.How this guy could stray from Annabella Sciorra is beyond me, but that's another story.What you see is this guy's whole life crumble down around him, due to his poor choices, his dishonesty, and his inability to control his cravings. Just about everything that could go wrong does, and his entire life, everything he thought he was working for, virtually blows up in his face.To finally see, and realize all he's lost is played out very well by Oldman.

Then, one day, his life slowly goes on a descent to hell when he is assigned to watch over the deliciously wicked Mona(Lena Olin, who should have gotten an Oscar nod for this performance). Mona makes a proposition to Jack Help her fake her death and he will be paid VERY well. The problem is that the mob, led by Roy Scheider, wants Jack to wipe her out, or they will wipe him out.

The direction is first rate by British master Peter Medak (Let Him Have It and Ponatiac Moon) and a very moody jazz score by the talented Mark Isham! I also own the soundtrack. Dariusz Wolski did amazing cinematography on this one. He would later go on to do Dark City and The Mexican. So yeah, a good crew and a great cast, what can I say? Other kudos must go out to the beautiful women in this, Lena Olen and Juliette Lewis are breathtaking in this. And the sex scenes are pretty steamy.....for me anyway. Some light B&D in this.

Things start to go downhill when he falls in love with a cruel and merciless assassin, Mona Demarkov, who's being targeted by the Mob. Romeo is Bleeding is the ultimate film-noir of the 20th century, everything about this film is so weird and evokes a sense of despair and hopeless that watching it &#145;till the last minute puts you gasping for more air. It's hard to put it into words, since Romeo is Bleeding is more like an experience itself, but a simplistic way to define the atmosphere the picture creates is describing it as a cross between the violence and style of a Batman movie (only without Batman) and your typical Humphrey Bogart flick, like The Maltese Falcon. Outstanding performances by Gary Oldman as Grimaldi and Lena Olin as Mona Demarkov. This character was a true present for Olin and she chews the scenery every moment she's on screen. The part was perfect for her, no one could pull this one of so perfectly, except perhaps for Jennifer Connelly, it would be interesting to see her in a role like that, since it seems that Jennifer herself jumped right of a 30's-40's noir movie (I was impressed by her in Dark City). Burt Reynolds or Tom Selleck would have suited perfectly into the role of Grimaldi, but Oldman was great. I also found very interesting that Jack Grimaldi wasn't a bad guy, Oldman constructed the character as a man who just wouldn't fit in the life that was given for him, and his thirst for more and more was responsible for sending his life into a spiral of  violence, decadence and death.

The rest of the cast is simply superb and I don't know how in the world Gary Oldman, Juliette Lewis, Annabella Sciorra and Lena Olin were not nominated for the Academy Award in their respective categories. Hilary Henkin has written a tight and compelling script and it's directed with sheer brilliance.Gary Oldmaan is one of the best actors of his generation and nowhere is that comment more obvious than in his performance in this film. As Jack Grimaldi, his New York accent is spot-on. He creates a character which most people will recognize somewhere in his/her life and delivers it with such ease that you live Jack's life through this outstanding actor's performance. Juliette Lewis has never been better. Her performance is funny, touching and ultimately tragic. Annabella Sciorra is glorious as Jack's earth-mother wife. Everything about her performance rings true. But, it's impossible to even find words to describe Lena Olin's Mona Demarkoff. Wow! Beautiful, sexy, tough, cold-hearted, vicious and unrelenting. I'm impossible to ever forget her performance once you've seen it. I haven't seen this film in years, and I'm still upset that she didn't win the Academy Award and wasn't even nominated!

It stars Gary Oldman, Lena Olin, Annabella Sciorra, Juliette Lewis and Roy Scheider. Music is by Mark Isham and Gary Alper and cinematography by Dariusz Wolski.Oldman plays corrupt cop Jack Grimaldi who does favours for The Mob in exchange for considerable payments. He has a loving wife and a mistress, but even that can't satiate his lust leanings. So when he is assigned to babysit Russian hit-woman Mona Demarkov (Olin), he is soon up to his neck in sexual yearnings. Something which spells trouble for everyone...A box office flop and savaged by some pro critics, Romeo Is Bleeding is clearly not a film for everyone! Yet for those who like their neo-noir sprinkled with satire and Grindhouse flavours, it's definitely the film for you. It's possible that some folk just didn't get it, that it has its tongue firmly in its bloody cheek? While some of the charges of misogyny and it being a macho fantasy are kind of moot given it's written by a woman! Undeniably it is guilty of going too far over the top, where as it cheekily laughs at itself it forgets to rein itself in, a problem since the finale is surprisingly touching but difficult to accept given the carnage previously.The trajectory of story is classic noir. Hapless corrupt copper Jack Grimaldi loves his wife but finds it easy to cheat with other women. Once the incredibly sexy Mona Demarkov slinks into his view, he's in big trouble. Add in The Mob after him due to not carrying out a hit and you get a noir protagonist spinning towards misery. Grimaldi narrates in snatches to keep the mood simmering on desperation, while visual smarts like a triplicate mirror image - or a scene at a amusement park - further enhance the noir atmosphere. While Olin's Demarko has to rank as one of the most potent femme fatales to steam up the screen.Superbly performed by the principal actors and backed up with solid support, film doesn't lack for quality in that department. And with Wolski's photography and Isham's music also leaving indelible marks on the sleaze and greed mood, tech credits are impressive. If only Medak had not tried to take too bigger a slice of cake then this would be talked about as a neo-noir classic. As it is, as appendages are lost and the pulses raised, this still plays out as a disgustingly sexy, weirdly off-kilter and bloody fun piece of film. 7.5/10 "},{"Title":"Best female movie villain ever!","Date":"7 August 2000","Score":"4 out of 4 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Crime, Drama","Review":"  Gary Oldman is a bad cop who doesn't know when to quit.

The acting (in my humble opinion (i never attended film school and didn't take a degree in media studies)) is absolutely fantastic (Gary Oldman can do no wrong) and the storyline is both engrossing and compelling. The film has every element which I crave, both a story to die for and the most powerful characters to ever bring homicidal mania to the screen. The end result is a roller-coaster of a movie portraying the inevitable emotional and spiritual demise of those who sell their soul for temporary material and physical gratification. The most important message I inferred from this movie is, if you are lucky enough to find true love in this life, then treasure it and protect it with your entire being. Once you have it and lose it, the worthlessness of your existence will only be compounded by its loss, and your life will be a metaphorical tumbleweed cast adrift in a desolate desert of despair.F*ckin great movie tho - 10/10 "},{"Title":"Lena Olin Shines!","Date":"17 September 2002","Score":"3 out of 3 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Crime, Drama","Review":"  Lena Olin gives the best performance of any actress cast in the role of a villain with Theresa Russell in The Black Widow running a close second.

Hell is when you should have walked, but you didn't. That's hell.Its not very often a film comes from way way out of left field and just blows me away, a film that actually holds interesting scenes knowingly long enough to allow you to drink them in. A film that lovingly caresses the essence of classic Film Noir, updates its violence conventions and very stylishly tells a tall tale that's so dangerously close to being over the top but yet is still believable enough to let it all roll. Romeo Is Bleeding is addictive-ly compelling in the same manner that Sergio Leone re-imagined Westerns are, and you have to scratch your head and wonder what kind of opiate were the critics and the viewing public mainlining on when this accidental masterpiece of a film debuted. This has happened many times before not only in cinema, but even in the long history of the Fine Art world. Films that at first are panned and forgotten that finally through the filter of time get interpreted right.A Neo Noir whose all star cast is excellent but actress Lena Olin steals every scene she is in.The narrated story revolves around the decent of NYPD Sergeant Jack Romeo Gramaldi into Noirsville. Jack's voice over narration while a throwback to classic noir is also unique, it's comprised of two voices, sometimes the present one the good Jim (aka repentant Jack), sometimes the bad Jack, and sometimes he listens to one head sometimes he listens to the other one.Jack looked just like anybody but inside he wasn't like anybody, he was going to do something about the dream. Jack supplies tips on the locations of safeguarded witnesses who will testify against the mob headed by Don Falcone. As Jack puts it he puts a quarter in a slot and $65,000 comes out of a PO Box. He takes the cash and feeds the drain hole he dug for it in the back yard of his Maspeth, Queens row house. Everything was going right until they started going wrong. Jack's tip on Gazzara gets both Gazzara and federal agents massacred by Queen of Queens rackets mob hit woman Mona Demarkov. Olin is Mona, the pieces lithe, sexy, Russian Femme Fatale and she is a smart, devious, scary-sexy one at that. She flashes her sex like a neon sign at the bottom of a dead end road. Jack looks like a deer caught in her headlights. She probably scared the hell out of a lot of conservative prepubescent boy scouts out there with her animal like sexuality in 1994. That may be the reason the film did poorly upon release, the Zeitgeist was't ready for the likes of Mona. She is feline, deadly, a fusion of Diana and Venus, and when she presents herself to Jack, he, and any of us out there that's got a pair of stones are goners. This film is one of the definitive depictions of the Female being deadlier than the Male. Jack is hypnotized between the allure of Mona and the money she baits him with. In the tradition of classic Noirs, its far more powerful a scene with what it doesn't show than say a similar sequence in Basic Instinct.After Demarkov is captured the second time she makes a deal with the feds to turn witness against Don Falcone. Sal asks Jack for her location Jack provides it but the info is wrong and Jack is summoned before Don Falcone who says he will make his wife ugly, burn his house down, and gut his girlfriend, and if he doesn't kill Mona he'll authorize it. On top of all this Jack fancies himself as a ladies man, a straying tomcat Romeo with women problems, both with his long suffering wife Natalie, and with dive waitress Sheri. Jack and Natalie have some poignant scenes together as their life together falls apart. Jack realizes too late that you don't own love, love owns you.Romeo Is Bleeding features a New York City festooned with graffiti, during the era of the World Trade Center. Williamsburg, Bushwick, and the JMZ elevated line in Brooklyn, Maspeth, in Queens, and lower Manhattan are all featured in the film. Sal like a chain smoking bad Bogart, tells Jack outside of Coney Island, that it (New York City) is like the Fall of Rome out there, the streets are filled with animals. Don Falcone acknowledges that he knows the barbarians are outside the gates but tells Jack that that doesn't mean we have to leave the door open.Weaved throughout the film both the sound design and the excellent mood pieces that make up Mark Isham's score fit so well to the scenes and overlaps creating a total atmosphere that I again recall the great collaborations of Leone/Morricone, Hitchcock/Herman and Lynch/Badalamenti. The acting is top notch every aspect of the film works amazingly well. This is a hardcore/hardboiled Neo Film Noir about melancholy and regret.

When a movie sticks in your mind, even if its just one quote, for so long after you have seen it (and the last time I saw it was 3 or 4 years ago) it means it can't be bad. So thats one thing. Another thing is that it has absolutely top notch cast. Gary Oldman, Lena Olin, Michael Wincott, Juliette Lewis, Annabella Sciorra, Will Patton and James Cromwell-all serious and talented actors. And the story is very interesting too. I mean you have this so-flawed main character who is at the same time very human and even sympathetic in a way that he's lost, he can't really help all the mess he's got himself in. It is a very human character, no? And in the end he does the right thing, but is it too late? Seems so. This movie is just about that-how we sometimes don't wake up and see the light until we have lost everything that was dear to us.What is the flaw with the movie? Maybe its that it didn't perhaps get everything it could from such an interesting storyline. I mean, corrupt cop who's in the mafia's pocket and cheats on his wife yet loves her, then gets caught in the dangerous game with a deadly Russian criminal who is a man eater at the same time...well, maybe not after all. Its a movie that succeeds in pulling it all together rather well and at the same time making us stay on the edge of our seat to see whats gonna happen next. Not many American modern movies have done that. I can mention one that came out the same year as this one, Carlito's Way. But that is a different story and genre really. That was a gangster film noir with a love story thrown in, this is both a film noir and a love story. Thats why the title is ROMEO is Bleeding.Gary Oldman makes one of his strongest performances and the same can perhaps be said for Olin, who is very convincing and menacing in her part as the deadly seductress whose only aim is to devour everything in her path. The ending leaves us in doubt to what really happened, there is no typical Hollywood ending and thats good. It again mirrors how things really go in life as Jack is left on his own waiting anxiously for his wife but nobody, not even he, knows if he will ever see her again. And thats art imitating life.

He tells them where the guy is, they whack him. Jack also juggles a wife, a girlfriend and a roving eye, which leads him to get caught by the FBI trying to get it on with a Russian hitwoman he is supposed to be handing over, (enter Lena) as Mona.Mona gets away, the underworld (headed by Roy Scheider) is p****d, and tells Jack to finish the job personally, or else.Jack was already a little stressed but this tweaks it up a notch, what with his girlfriend and wife both threatening to leave, and when he finds Mona she counter offers with a payment to tell the bad guys that she has been killed, assuming by the time they work out they were duped she will have left the country.The basic lesson here is don't trust anyone, by the time Jack sorts himself out he has Mona and the mob trying to kill him, he loses a couple of toes to the latter at one stage, and over a few meetings works out than Mona is absolutely nuts, and will do anything necessary to get what she wants, and I mean anything.Everything about this film is just a bit off kilter, meaning that at times it can feel quite surreal. The tone is always kept dark and if anything it is perhaps a bit of an update on the traditional noir films of the early years of Hollywood, only with a twist.I did like this film, even though it took a while getting where it was going, I guess sometimes you can over-twist things. I have heard some people worship this film and place it right at the top of their all time lists, and they have every right to, though having seen it a couple times I just don't get it personally.What I put that down to is I think everyone has a phase where they decide what it is that they actually like, as opposed to what they think they should like, believe it or not some never work this out.This in large part explains Gwen Stefani's mainstream success.During the immediate period after you make your decision you upgrade anything a couple points, for me this caused me to elevate movies like Tremors and Deep Cover, and I suppose for some Romeo is Bleeding is their example.Final Rating &#x96; 7 / 10.

Oldman is breath-taking, cynical and world-weary delivering his Marlowe-style quips, raw and vulnerable reaching crescendo when he puts a gun barrel in his mouth. It would be too much to ask his co-stars to outshine him, but they certainly keep up. Olin produces a nightmarish laugh at the most inappropriate times, and Juliette Lewis's cocktail waitress (what else?) Sheri's innocence is perfectly ignorant, far too ignorant to survive in this brutal arena. Annabella Sciorra as Natalie completes the trio of Jack's women, his not-so-unaware wife. She is not as cold-hearted towards Jack as Mona, not as infatuated as Sheri, but her flawed love contains a bit of both. She points a gun at him, and we know she knows. Sitting on the porch they have one of those oblique conversations only old married couples know, where every utterance is sub-text, and restraint and feigned ignorance are the name of the game. Jack never quite gets to grips with her, and that is to be his ultimate tragedy.There are hints of Chandler here (the letter to Jack from The Boys), and Chinatown, too, most noticeably in the bloodied, deformed demeanor of the protagonist in the final third, but Romeo is Bleeding is a stylish noir piece that acknowledges its antecedents without racking up debts.And then there is the ending, of such heartbreaking, poignant beauty, Oldman and Sciorra pitch-perfect, deftly shot and edited, a wave you ride and crash on shore with. Startling, stunning, and yet how could this tale have ended otherwise? Sometimes, she stays a little longer. And then she's gone. Not a perfect film, but a perfect ending, and I'll take that every time.

Some examples are the ultra-subtle dramas like The Constant Gardener and Michael Clayton. Of all the movies that I would predict would be in that category, a movie like Romeo is Bleeding would probably be the LEAST likely to be included on that list. It's a full-blown noir film, with interesting characters and a decent story.But to my surprise, I find myself at a loss when trying to find words to write this review. The movie has a great sense of atmosphere, and talented actors (Lena Olin in particular), but the story is a complete mess. It's really hard (if not impossible at times) to figure out what is going on. Hence my troubles.Here is what's clear. Jack Grimaldi (Gary Oldman) is a corrupt cop who plays both sides of the battle between the cops and the mob, run by Don Falcone (Roy Scheider). Trouble starts with Mona Demarkov (Lena Olin), a Russian hitwoman (or so says the IMDb synopsis says) that Falcone wants dead and the cops want alive to bring down Falcone (I think). Grimaldi is caught in the middle, but Mona offers him a solution to play them both and get away with a lot of money.The acting is solid all around. Gary Oldman is solid as Grimaldi. Oldman is not afraid to show a wide spectrum of emotion, and that's what makes him great here. Lena Olin gives promise as a complete psychopath, but strangely Mona isn't as developed as she could be. Still, Olin does what she can with what she has, and Mona is uncannily like Catherine Trammell in Basic Instinct (except that when compared to Mona Demarkov, the Sharon Stone character has the viciousness of a housecat). Anabella Sciorra is terrific as Grimaldi's wife, but again, she's not that developed. The only actor that doesn't work is Juliette Lewis as Grimaldi's lover. Lewis seems out of place in this role, but fortunately her character isn't on screen very much.Romeo is Bleeding has a great noirish atmosphere, complete with the soft jazz soundtrack. It's a throwback to the noir movies of the 40's, even though it's in color (director Peter Medak uses this to his advantage). It would be a great movie if the story had any coherence.

He treats every role that he is given and provides legitimacy for every movie he has been in. For proof of this please rent The Fifth Element and realize that he is the one of two reasons why that movie doesn't suck. Much like that movie, Romeo Is Bleeding is made by the intensity brought to the screen by Oldman in this film noir-esquire type thriller.Oldman (Leon The Professional) stars as Detective Jack Grimaldi, a cop who is on the take with the local mafia. He provides any and all kinds of information including where federal informants are located. However, when the mafia sends a Russian hit man or woman to take care of an informant, she kills not only the informant but the cops protecting him. Mona, played by Lena Olin (Chocolat) gets caught by the cops and Jack is hired by the mafia boss Don, played by Roy Scheider (Jaws) to kill Mona. Mona gets away and hires Jack to double cross Don. Don finds out and threatens Jack's wife and girlfriend as well as Jacks life if he does not kill her. Jack then tries to come up with a plan to get away from everybody and try and save is failing marriage.As I have said Oldman carries the movie with his acting. He has this dry wit that works so well in these anti-hero roles he takes on. In this movie he is a true anti-hero. Whenever he is sitting with his wife, Natalie, played by Annabella Sciorra (Chasing Liberty) you can see that he loves her. All of the money that he takes gets from the mafia is going to make a better life for the two of them. But he also has a girlfriend, Sheri, played by Juliette Lewis (Starsky & Hutch), and he treats her like she is, easy sex. Oh, and she is not the first girlfriend Jack has had, so he has been cheating on his wife for a long time. Through all of this, Oldman gives a convincing performance and never once is he not believable as this very loving but evil guy.Lena Olin is also convincing as this mean spirited, well, bitch. Along the lines of film noir, Mona is the main cause of Jacks downfall, and Lena plays it perfectly. She adds to the tension and is remarkable in that every scene she is in there is a felling of uncomfortableness that Oldman works off of wonderfully. Both Olin and Oldman light up the screen together.I do have a few complaints, not big though. Roy Scheider is miscast as the mob boss. Not to be stereotyping but he doesn't look Italian, he is definitely not give the image of being tough enough, and there is another actor Dennis Farina (Striking Distance) in the movie that would have been perfect for the part, so its hard not to think how much better he would have been than Scheider. I like the acting he has done in the past, especially Jaws, but not his time.One last actor of note, Michael Wincott (The Crow) had a small role in this film. I have always enjoyed his work, especially The Crow and I don't know why he doesn't get more work. His voice and demeanor make him the classic bad guy and I wish he was out there in more prominent roles.I am amazed that a woman wrote the script for this movie. There are no scenes in the movie that I would say a woman would enjoy. This is a guy movie. How Helen Henkin, who also scripted Road House, knows how to make a guy happy I don't know, but she does. Another complaint is that she did a marvelous job in that every word of dialog is important to the story, but sometimes the scene was a little long. I don't know how, but she should have tightened up some of the scenes. The director Peter Mednek should have noticed this and make the movie flow quicker. He did a great job of bringing us a modern day film noir movie. I just think the pacing could have been quicker.Overall, this is an enjoyable movie, which makes the fact that this was a challenge from Benn all the more fun. This is not a movie for everyone, especially women, so if you feel like watching a decent film noir flick, rent this, just pay attention to every thing and you will enjoy it. Oh yeah, you get to see Lena Olin's breasts too.*This movie and others can be read at www.bbmc.dockratent.com* "},{"Title":"I was expecting much more than I got.

It's a downbeat, pitch black, simmering sociopathic neo noir filled to the brim with excellent character actors and actresses inhabiting various delicious cop, gangster and femme fatale roles. It has a lyrical, moody poetry to it it, evoking the noir flicks of the 40's albeit with a decidedly modern, violent and demoralizing bite to it. Gary Oldman, in a monumentally underrated performance, plays Jack Grimaldi, a sleaze bag cop attempting to play the Police force, the Feds and the mob against each other in order to make obscene amounts of dirty money for himself. He's a two timing, amoral asshole of a protagonist, but Oldman plays him in a stray dog, sheepish way that you just can't help root for him, and feel like an outlaw doing so. Of course his scheme falls apart (as all schemes like this do, in movie land) spectacularly so, at the hands of Mona Demarkov (Lena Olin) a tyrannical, deranged Russian contract killer with a penchant for gleeful brutality and unhinged violence. Olin is a wonder in the role, a grinning black velvet spider and a source of constant nightmares for Jack, as well as the audience. The film has a darkly comic, almost fairy tale like quality to it, a sense of inevitable karmic catastrophe at the hands of the mob and the law. Oldman mournfully narrates the proceedings from a hazy desert enclave that may or may not just be a dream, and yearns for a second chance. Medal directs with steely, melodramatic precision. Juliette Lewis does her early 90's ditzy thing to perfection, Annabella Sciorra is sweet as Jack's poor wife, the only sympathetic character in the whole deal, Roy Scheider feels a bit miscast as the vengeful mob boss, but Ron Perlman, Michael Wincott, Will Patton, James Chromwell, David Proval and Dennis Farina are top notch in welcome cameos. I feel like this script alone should have gotten a lot more attention, let alone the simply stunning, beautiful film that it has turned into. Anyone who's a fan of crime films, noir, good story lines, and this troupe of actors (and really, how can you not be, just look at this cast!!) will love this.

Break the rules and you pay for it. You lose what's good but what you fail to appreciate because you're too dumb or greedy to know any better.Gary Oldman is nothing short of terrific in this movie, and very effective are the three women with whom he is involved his wife (Annabella Sciorra), his waitress girl friend (Juliette Lewis), and a very twisted Russian hit woman (Lena Olin). Oldman breaks most all the rules I just mentioned, and he is the loser for it. He finds that hell is on this earth, and he says so.He falls in love with his stash of dirty cash. He sells out his job and buddies. He betrays his wife. He is greedy for more money and sex. He doesn't stick with his love. He ends up in the middle of nowhere (another hell) with a bit of hope and memories, and that's after attempted suicide (the gun was out of ammo). Gary goes for the green and loses the gold, his wife. A good woman, a loyal woman, is worth more to a man than any amount of precious jewels. So goes the proverb, and this is true.His wife is so disillusioned with him that she has lost all feeling for life. She believes in nothing. She despairs and now fears death. He has killed her hopes and dreams. She never comes backs to him.His girl friend loves him and is under the illusion he loves her. She's an honestly frustrated soul, but she'd get over it except that he ends up killing her too, not only directly but by getting involved with the Lena Olin. She's a fantastic character who gets sadistic satisfaction at betraying every man in sight, but she gets her comeuppance too, much to her surprise.It's a simple morality tale. Oldman is a dirty cop and a dirty husband and a weak and misdirected man who loses what he had. He pays for it.Despite all that, he's an enormously sympathetic character, because we all have his weaknesses. We want him to beat the odds and win, and he tries very hard to do it. We're rooting for him and ourselves and everyone else who tries, and we know we're all going to fall down to various degrees. What man might not be tempted by Lena Olin's charms, even knowing what a bitch she is and how dangerous she is? What man might not fall for Juliette Lewis offering a simple and uncomplicated love? But why Gary may have betrayed his wife for her sister or her niece, we do not know. There is no surer way to destroy a marriage than adultery.The movie is told in flashback and with voice over narration, reminding me of how Carlito's Way was done. It was effective, lending a bittersweet, sorrowful, and at times comical tone to the essentially tragic proceedings. The music score was very effective at times in its use of a jazz trumpet. In fact, it was written and played by jazz trumpet player Mark Isham. Jazz scores as in such film noirs as Elevator to the Gallows and Odds Against Tomorrow are often very effective, and this movie shows how it can be done in a neo-noir.

I bought the film thinking it might be good and it was not only good, it was actually amazing. The cinematography was beautiful, Oldman and Olin were very good in their roles, the rest of the cast was also good though I think James Cromwell could have a bigger part. The storyline was good and I was not bored for a second, I was interested in what was going to happen next throughout the movie so the pacing was well adjusted.The film is a film noir set in the 90s with a sort of New York we have not seen before. Some people might claim the psycho woman character was unrealistic but I do not think so, many criminals are not like normal people, and she's a prime example.In short, this is one of the most unknown great films that can be bought for a low price.

I do like that we have it dictating metaphorical spaces of being lured and trapped by that desire.A hole in the ground that he has to keep feeding with money. Watching through binoculars at sex across the street, inflamming the desire. A dream where he's inside a giant ferry wheel and buffed around while she is playing his life at dice down below. The embarrassment of rolling on the floor with her when his colleagues walk through the door. It ends in an aptly noirish way, quoting Detour, where he's been the narrator gone mad as he waits hopelessly in some desert limbo, flicking through the photo-album that chronicles a life wasted when desire entered the pictures and all this (diner, photos) as being trapped in his own mind that relives the past and is conjuring the film itself.Even that is rather intermittent here, not the result of focused vision like the Coens or Almodovar did. Truth be told, I'm simply not too enamored of the obviousness that accompanies many of these modern attempts at film noir. It's like an excessively made up face wearing with some effort a selfconscious grimace as it makes its way through the amoral occasion. For whatever reason I am reminded a lot of Lynne's attempt at Lolita; something that was elusively fluid in its original guise, stultified by too much focus on grooming appearances.Oldman affects his usual twitching self, rather apt in the whole thing.

It's the same with the Western genre or the Science Fiction genre &#150; you go into one of these sorts of films knowing what to expect and the same can be said for film noir. Director Peter Medak basically uses Romeo is Bleeding as an example he knows what to put into a film noir and thus, it's no real surprise that masses of people don't like the film since the majority will not know what to look out for and why such content is included.There are plenty of references to noir as a whole. The way the story is told through flashback, the blatant femme fatale, the protagonist/focus working as some sort of law enforcer and the way certain characters such as the mob boss, the 'rat' and of course the femme fatale are included. Romeo is Bleeding is no doubt an entertaining film with a smart idea and a basic if not effective plot but its look and feel is a little disappointing and as someone who has seen multiple film noirs and neo noirs, I found it to be a disappointment overall. The film feels like a cross between Angel Heart (1987) and Basic Instinct (1992) as its voiceovers and disturbing content is mixed in with a very dangerous female character. Why I think Romeo is Bleeding leans more towards the film noir genre rather than the neo noir genre is because of its content. Jack (Oldman) is a law enforcer but not a lone private eye since he has his authoritarian buddies around him most of the time. He narrates his story in the same way Walter Neff does in Double Indemnity, telling us what happened from a safe place yet Walter was shot and injured physically, Jack is injured psychologically. Mona Demarkov (Olin) wears all the bright red lipstick and jewellery and is seductive enough to represent a femme fatale but it's at a very basic level &#150; she just wants to antagonise Jack rather than out and out get rid of him. Again, this is director Medak showing us he knows his stuff about noir without really convincing us these people are characters, more-so wax work model examples in a noir museum.What I did find clever is that the main difference between film and neo noir is its content and how that is played with in Romeo is Bleeding. Neos are more violent and have more sex and profanity but Romeo is Bleeding doesn't have much of this until its climax. We see Sheri (Lewis), Jack's barmaid squeeze on the side, in lingerie at various points and we see Mona in bondage attire towards the end on top of Jack but we never actually see the sex. Jack also rather unfortunately loses one of his body parts at one point in the film but we don't see it get 'removed', just him turning up at home with a whole lot of blood in a certain place. I feel this is Medak's 'nod' to film noir in terms of censorship. Sure, there is blood but the aftermath of the taboo events are emphasised not the acts themselves. This is similar to Double Indemnity and other classic noir but more distant to neo noir such as Angel Heart and Basic Instinct where the violence and sex is full on, graphic and we see it all. Romeo is Bleeding also utilises its location very well The constant passing of L-trains, the graffiti covered walls, the way lights are missing their lamp shades when they need to but have them when required all act as great visuals to combine with the voiceovers and the sax music at various points to make and noir fan get excited. The film, however, just plods most of the time and although I found it interesting I feel the majority of people will dislike the film but that's probably because they see Gary Oldman is in it and realise it's a crime film and probably tell themselves it'll be good before even realise what they've got here. This is an exercise in noir &#150; both film and neo and should only be tackled by those interested and familiar with the genre(s).

His direction is self paved as a crooked cop who dabbles with organized crime, a thoughtless husband, careless lover, and a crooked dancer high on greed low on concern. It is hard to imagine that such a person as the films early unconcerned character exists. There are stylish scenes on rooftops, amusement parks, cheap hotels, backyards and even a back room of a bar. If that person does in fact exist Oldman depicted him vividly. The most important moment of the film for me was one in which Romeo is secretly dictating a love letter while in grave danger of his life, and even then he manages to create extraordinary lies and unbelievable denial. In addition to being a dark noir piece there is a horror story, and a morality play hidden within the dark images and brash dialogues.

It is a contemporary film noir. Classic elements of film noir are represented the shadowy and dark city, the jazz score, the cop on the take, the wife, the mistress, the mob, the double crosses, the sad end. Romeo is Bleeding, however, does noir better than most. Strong roles by great actors is key to this movie. The performance of Lena Olin alone is enough to make this film stand out. But there is so much more to this film.....The film begins with a foreshadowing. An intriguing opening that keeps you hooked throughout the movie, trying to figure out how the film arrived there. We are introduced to Jack Grimaldi, a cop who has made some bad choices. He is a cop on the take, working for the mob. Basically, Jack sells the lives of witnesses, $65,000 at a time. He lies to himself by saying what he is doing isn't all bad, since his instructions are to kill only the witness and not the cops. But soon the mob ignores him and murders cops who are guarding the witness. Jack starts to want out, but the mob boss reminds him that he's in deep, too deep to get out. He is given another assignment to find Mona DeMarkov, an assassin the mob wants dead....When Jack is assigned by the police to guard Mona, we can't believe his luck. His assignment will be easy, we presume he has Mona, now all he has to do is make a phone call and collect his money, right? Wrong! Mona is a formidable woman who's not so easy to kill. Add to that Jack's fascination with his sexy target, and we know we're in for a wild ride. Ultimately, Jack's undoing is his attraction to Mona. She seduces Jack and draws him into her deadly web. They play an intricate cat and mouse game, double crossing each other again and again. Just when you think its over, the plot twists and shocks you. I must comment on the wonderful performances in this film. Gary Oldman is terrific in his role as the cop, caught between the cops, the mob and Mona. The whole film shows his progression from a corrupt cop who cheats on his wife to a man fighting for his life, then to someone trying to do the right thing and finally to what we see at the end. Incredible! Lena Olin is also amazing as the sexy assassin. A strong female character as an interesting villain is a rarity and Lena Olin plays it perfectly. Annabella Sciorra is good in her small role as Jack's wife loyal, but sad. When the film ends, her character turns out to be a surprise we didn't see coming. (I hope you see this movie so you know what I mean). Finally, the plot is terrific. The cat and mouse game between Jack and Mona is riveting, as we wonder how it will all end. The ending of the film does turn out to be a surprise, in spite of the foreshadowing in the beginning. An unforgettable film......

The themes are very similar- each starts with a simple man trying to get *just a bit* ahead by stepping *just a bit* outside the lines of ethical conduct.  The rest of each movie is a chain of increasingly crushing events that spiral to a final, inevitable conclusion.What I appreciate the most about these films is how unforgivingly fate treats the two lunks.  They both think they can get away with a small little scam (of at least what they convince themselves is a small little scam), but by taking that first, almost innocent step they unwittingly lock themselves into a breathtakingly steep dive down toward rock bottom.And they are absolutely helpless to escape.  By the middle of both films these two have a dull, dazed look about them, as if they can't believe 1) what is happening, and 2) that they have brought it upon themselves, however unintentionally.And what I think we don't like to admit is that there is a lot of Everyman in these two.  The first step across the line is so easy, and looks so harmless.  Nobody expects the ferocity with which the consequences can come roaring back.And what is still more human, neither Jack nor Jerry will bail out once things start going bad.  They both keep trying to fix what they have started by taking one more step further in.  All they end up being able to focus on is getting things back to the way they were, before they made that first mis-step.  Then everything will be all right.  But this, of course, serves only to deepen their holes until everything finally caves in.I think _Romeo Is Bleeding_ one-ups _Fargo_ with its ending, probably my favorite movie ending ever.

He has tackled every role from a Russian terrorist in Air Force One to Dracula in Bram Stoker's Dracula to a black wannabe pimp in True Romance.

He is great, as always, and the cast is full of talented performers, but a lot of them are wasted.  The only actors, besides Oldman, who have standout roles are Annabella Sciorra and Lena Olin, though she struggles with her American accent.

The film's plot could have been easily been set in the 50's, it's an essential noir, with the femme fatale and everything but...these one goes far beyond it.

Olin is the most beautiful and diabolic of all villains in history, her acting is truly deep and convincing, moreover when Mona is laughing manically.

Selling him in such a sex way was too much, really excellent. But not for Jack, although he fell in love with her, that filthy f**k was so selfish that he was willing to be with her even if not in this world. His face when trying to commit suicide is superb!!!

And in the end it seemed as if those two would be together forever, with Mona haunting Sgt. in death, a ghost of what wasn't and what could have been; suffering 'till death, for the love he will never gave to any of the women he had.

Great performances by, among others, Gary Oldman, cannot rescue a plot that turns ludicrously improbable in the last third, not to mention a gimmicky, sacharrin trick ending that the film hasn't earned.The film is strong through the first hour or so as it establishes Oldman as a corrupt cop whose entangled personal and professional double-crosses are coming apart just as moral qualms are starting to touch him. Oldman's characterization is impeccable, despite the overwritten, mock-Chandler voice-over narration.***Minor spoilers aheadUp to this point the film is grittily believable, but then takes a sudden turn into laughably implausible action drama of the worst kind. Mona, the assassin/mobster queen (the plot never quite decides which she is, nor explains why the head of one mob would be acting as paid assassin for another), escapes from Oldman's car in a ridiculous scene that asks us not to notice Oldman could stop her simply by taking his foot off the gas and putting it on the brake. (See it and you'll understand). Strangely, a preview of this second-worst scene is featured early in the movie. The script also asks us to accept that Mona cuts off her own arm, walks downstairs, and calmly leaves it alongside a corpse that will be burned so as to make it appear to her pursuers that she is dead. Never mind dental records; never mind that she allows Oldman, a witness to the whole scene, to walk away; some of us would have thought of burning a whole corpse and leaving a driver's licence.This moment is followed by the movie's best cinematic Noir scene, but by that point I had already given up the will to believe in the plot.This is a film that delivers many of the elements of Noir - the doomed hero, the dangerous woman, the dark city - but fails to build a compelling story out of them.

I'd like to think that it is the film which is problematic not me. Romeo is not merely bleeding, he is falling apart. What we have here is a classic case, of a film that tries to be more than it is capable of. It feels convoluted, unbelievable, and unfortunately is not very involving. NYPD Sargent Jack Grimaldi has been doing petty jobs for a mob which the department has been going after. He gets a few thousand dollars with every job, and he adds it to a pile hidden in his backyard. His latest job is to take out the Russian assassin, who he just arrested the other day. While in his custody she offers him an even better deal with more money. But first , he has to fake her death, getting him clean with the boss, and then he must get out of the mob gig before he gets caught. Things are getting tougher with each passing moment.The whole thing doesn't come together very well. Romeo is Bleeding would have been better with the less is more approach. Some details like Jack's involvement with three different women, and the stiff necked feds (who only appear twice) prove fairly useless to the story. Their screen time may have been a bit more worth while, if anyone bothered to act well, too bad no one does; no one except Roy Scheider. This guy has never done a bad movie, and his one talky scene is actually a pretty good one, certainly the best in the film. Him aside, there are two kinds of performances in Romeo is Bleeding; there are the lazy ones, and there are the over-done ones. Gary Oldman is a case of the former. This is not the kind of person we end up caring for. The ending, which is supposed to earn our sympathy instead earns our impatience. It has an overwritten melodramatic monologue which drags on way too long. Romeo is Bleeding delivers the classic 'noir' first person narration. If it had done a better job of explaining the story as it unfolded rather than the tiny little voice in Oldman's head, I think that would have also been an improvement on the filmWhen all is said and done, Romeo is Bleeding qualifies as a swing and a miss. It is in desperate need of a rewrite, an energy boost, and some brains. I'll have to say skip this one.

She infuses all her scenes with energy which even Oldman has problems keeping pace with and effortlessly steals the entire film, directed to slightly overdo the grind-glass voiced Russian hitwoman Demarkov as a genuinely dangerous yet irresistible psycho bitch from hell. She pulls it off with great panache though and her performance is what you'll remember long after watching the film. Elsewhere, Oldman freaks out convincingly and by the book, Juliette Lewis pouts around in her underwear pulling her usual few faces before she is bumped off to oblivion, while Sciorra and Scheider leave their mark but end up underused in their episodes. An affectionate yet uneven tribute to film noir that occasionally loses its step and spreads itself a little too thin for comfort, but still definitely watchable.

At one point his character says All I could think about was feed the hole, feed the hole... That hole represents his own private Hell, one that he created and he is perpetuating - but as long as things are going smoothly, if badly, things are OK.One great, great scene is where Oldman casually sets his gun down on the kitchen table and Sciorra - sadly, in too small a role - picks it up and points it at him. The look on his face is priceless.This movie has the same ethos as Bad Lieutenant, but doesn't have that movie's crushing, personally wretched banality. It's also not quite as shocking or intense. Instead, it uses its main character's arrogance and sadistic tendencies as fatal flaws which ultimately help to bring down an otherwise quasi-noble guy.I liked this movie up to a point, but sometimes it feels like I'm being manipulated - shown something shocking just for the sake of it being shocking. Like the scene with Olin and Oldman in the car that is excerpted at the beginning. A lot of that is just unnecessary. It's supposed to help set the tone, but by this time the tone has already been set - these are both desperate characters with a lot to lose and little to gain.

I understand this move will appeal to some people but it just didn't click with me.One interesting thing worth noting is that this is almost the opposite of a chick flick. It seems to appeal more to the men I know then the women. I saw this with a group of people.

The script is a mess, as we are being served an already cold meal of voice-over detective story with a limp, ludicrous plot points like the one where Mona waits for Jack to arrive to kill her, just so she can talk him into killing Falcone and set her up with a new identity, him falling for it when he could have easily got out, as it was already clear he had to kill at least one person. They blame it on the voice, but actually it's the dumb alter ego of both director and writer who is at fault. And the casting director, because given some chemistry between Jack and Mona, his moves might have been more understandable. Oldman, terribly miscast here, fails to portray an average Joe, mainly due to his emotional over the top acting style, more fit for a conflicted crack addict, or a flamboyant pimp, but under no circumstances a functional guy in society. The slow witted story teller walks us thru what is supposed to make us witness the down fall of a guy who gets stuck inside his own web of mistakes, but as it turns out, the only part credible enough is the one where he drives himself into a pole losing all his leverage. The whole things rapidly plunges from laughable to dumb and pretentious crapolo, and finally to involuntarily breaking the fifth wall, and making the viewer search for the remote control.

It's one of those movies where afterwards you ask yourself what you were doing wasting two hours in the theatre and wondering what other movies were on that night that you could have seen instead.Mark Isham provides the requisite brushes on snare drum, standup bass, and trumpet. Gary Oldman provides a somewhat different maniac from what you're used to seeing this one implodes from the inside.Mrs Hallstrom provides the chillingly scary psychopath, and in some scenes, especially one towards the end in her car, she shows that classic 'bone structure', stereotypical Scandinavian blonde or not.And for the record, pronounce her name 'Layna O'Leen' please. If you meet her and say it as they do in the trailer, you're likely to get a slap in the face. As it sounds like one of the Swedish words for a part of the male genitalia.But she's good and almost everyone is good. Scheider is about the only one doesn't work for me.
