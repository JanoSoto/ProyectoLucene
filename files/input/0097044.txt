Cybill Shepherd was given great reviews for her role, and they were well deserved. The beginning of this movie starts in the past when Corinne Jeffries (Cybill) whose picture-perfect marriage comes to a shattering halt when her husband Louie dies unexpectedly. Fortunately, Louse gets a second shot at life when he agrees to be recycled back to earth as the newborn Alex Finch (Robert Downey, JR). Alex goes on to live his new life forgetting his past life while Corinne tries to get on with hers. But fate crosses Alexs path 23 years later when he meets Corinne's daughter Miranda (Mary Stuart Masterson) and is suddenly flooded with a wealth of unwanted memories (this is where the fun begins, and embarrassing situations occur.) The music is great and the scenes are heart felt and very cute. You wont be disappointed if you give it a chance, Chances Are you'll like it. Very funny and sweet!

Flashforward 19 years where we see Shepherd's daughter (Mary Stuart Masterson) preparing to graduate from college and encountering a young man (Robert Downey Jr.)who, it turns out is the reincarnation of her father. The film is a little on the predictable side...the story goes all the places you expect it to, but it is so charmingly played by an energetic cast (especially Shepherd and Downey) that you can't help but get wrapped up in the fun. Shepherd has rarely been seen on screen to better advantage and she and Downey are backed by a talented group of character actors in supporting roles.

I've always liked it.

Yes, it's a total fantasy, but still, we can dream!  I like all of the principal actors and find Robert Downey Jr. adorable.  The music was also very enjoyable, as Johnny Mathis sings the title tune (obviously  ) ), and the theme-'After All'- written by Tom Snow and performed by Cher and Peter Cetera, has a great sound.

It seemed to me a nice comedy with some silly moments. The costume designer Albert Wolsky did his best!!! The same as wonderful set decorator Robert R. Benton - this man really had a very good taste!!! But the script writers disappointed me extremely. The best ending would be the scene on the ladder, but instead of it, they decided that the father and his daughter should be together. Don't like the ending. The father becomes boyfriend of his own daughter and his ex-wife knows about it and finds it alright. It would be OK, if the scriptwriters would for example say that now there is a different soul in the body, but they did not, they only deprived him of memories. The actors were good, they were really funny. Cybill Shepherd was charming, Robert Downey Jr. was very funny in the dancing scene  )))... But some of the moments spoil even the impression of good acting. For example, Corinne Jeffries, played by Cybill Shepherd after the death of her husband was waiting for him 23 years (it's a long time!), she was true to him, she loved nobody but him, and when she met him and was just about making love to him, after a scene with her friend Philip Train (Ryan O'Neal), she very easily betrayed the man she was longing for so many years!!!

Because RDJ's character, Alex, is Louie reincarnated and Louie is Miranda's father and Alex is in love with Miranda, and since he remembers his old life as Louie he loves his past widowed wife. It sounds strange, and I've heard a lot of psychics say stuff like people you know now could be you're husband/wife in the past life and now are you're brother/sister.

Once he arrives in heaven, he makes such a big fuss about getting back to his pregnant wife that the people of heaven forget to give him a special memory blocking syrum before he is reincarnated.At the age of 23, the re-incarnated Louie (now Alex Finch) doesn't remember a thing until he sees his wife again.  As Alex tries to convince her that he is indeed her deceased husband, this is where the beauty and lovely comedy begins to unfold.Such a story could have easily fallen apart had it not been for Robert Downey Jr's convincing role as Alex Finch.  Shepherd also deliveres in this film by being realistically adverse to the notion of accepting Alex as her reincarnated husband.  The beginnings of the movie seem a little slow, plot-wise, but they are an important foundation to the rest of the movie. The final clinch in the plot was a surprise to me (without ruining any details).  All in all, you have to watch this movie at least once.

He comes back as a young 22-year-old in the present day and falls for first his daughter (not realizing she's his daughter) and then his wife (when he remembers she's his wife.)I really, really liked this movie. Much has been said about the guy's (Louie) twisted sense of morality, since he falls for his own daughter, but remember, that's when he doesn't know she's his daughter. (It seems that most people don't understand that at one point an angel gives Louie a shot that erases the memory of his past life.)What really struck me was the great soundtrack for the movie.

Nothing more or less.","Date":"27 September 2007","Score":"3 out of 5 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Fantasy, Romance","Review":" What a loss the passing of director Emile Ardolino was! He could take a light script and, with the right casting and editing, put a twinkle in it and make it shine like a star. This particular star may not be the brightest in the sky as great romances go, but it is definitely one that keeps you tuned in to the end. You really want to know how things are going to work out.The script is perfect for Cybill Shepherd, who at the time needed to capitalize on her Moonlighting success for the new generation who was (fortunately for her) probably unaware of how many big screen major duds she had after a very promising start. In this film she's every bit back in form as a still-pining widow living vicariously through her daughter (Mary Stuart Masterson on the cusp of stardom which would peak with Fried Green Tomatoes two years later). She may have looked too young for the role, but that works well for the way the story unfolds. This is her film, but she doesn't overstep her bounds as a lead.SHepherd graciously allows Robert Downey Jr. to carry much of the film and shows a more mature comic flair than he had in his previous films to that point. And there's ample support from Ryan O'Neal (in his best role in years) and Christopher MacDonald. Masterson's natural charm pretty much coasts on its own, either that or she has a way of making her character seem like a breath of fresh air with every word.Ardolino makes good use of his cast's sex appeal the same way he did with Dirty Dancing, but this film is not quite as sizzling so you could still watch it with your parents if they happened to be in the room. (Use your best judgment, they're your parents after all.) I give this film a high mark because it is very user friendly, romantic comedy enthusiasts will find it sublime, and those who are just watching along with them should find plenty of humor to enjoy as well.Again, credit goes to Emile Ardolino for making the most of a charming script by Randy and Perry Howze. (Where are they now?) Ardolino's next film would be the phoned-in sequel to Three Men and A Baby but his final theatrical release (Sister Act) would finally give him the nine-figure-grossing smash hit he deserved. Mr. Ardolino, your cinematic touch IS missed!

Masterson probably has the hardest role and is just adorable. The movie is in the vein of both romantic movies such as While You Were Sleeping, When Harry Met Sally, Sleepless in Seattle and the high gimmick sorts of movies like Big, Back to the Future, Peggy Sue Got Married. I hate to say this, because this cast was superb and I'd never change any of them- but I think it didn't succeed as well as the movies mentioned above because the box office appeal of the cast was  just not as great as Meg Ryan, Tom Hanks, Michael J. Fox, and Kathleen Turner at the time the movie was made.  It's not superbly written - e.g., the characters' lines are not particularly memorable. Yet it's executed to perfection. The romantic yearnings are truly palpable, the feeling of people falling in love is exquisitely communicated, love's timelessness and all-encompassing sweep, the feeling of loss and desire to recapture that connection, are so touchingly delivered.

In my opinion, this is one of his best.Along with the under-rated 1993 Heart & Souls, these two movies bookend one another beautifully. They could almost be confused as the same movie since they look the same, have the same sense of humor and have the same leading man playing essentially the same character with minor differences. It may be why the new Chances Are cover has changed from the original 1989 purple and white cover. While Chances Are has RDJ being reincarnated to reunite with his long-lost love and her family, Heart & Souls has RDJ as the conduit for five ghosts to set things right with THEIR families. I believe Chances Are edges out the deserving Heart & Souls by a smidgen due to the better romantic theme and simple storyline vs. the more complicated Heart & Souls script due to the five ghosts' story lines.As for Chances Are by itself, RDJ plays a reincarnated Louie Jeffries who was married in the 1960s to Cybill Shepherd (this was her last beauty movie where she looked stunning). Louie dies on his first anniversary and is reincarnated as RDJ. RDJ stumbles across the adorable Mary Stuart Masterson at university and eventually crosses paths with newspaper superstar, Ryan O'Neal, and Cybill, who has kept the candle lit for her dead husband for two decades, all within the first 15 minutes of the movie. Through several twists and comedic turns, RDJ realizes who he was and tries rekindling the flames with someone old enough to be his mother - and everyone else thinks he's either a gold-digger extraordinaire and/or psychotic. The entire story reminds me of the old-time Jimmy Stewart and Cary Grant comedies of yesteryear where a little bit of overacting was allowed because it put a smile on your face no matter if the story was credible or not.The movie is light, funny, charming, and just enough romance to make it a perfect date movie. The men will enjoy the humor and women will enjoy the romance. The cast looks to be genuinely enjoying themselves which makes the unlikely story easy to swallow. Robert Downey, Jr. has always been a special physical actor. He embodies the qualities of other actors into his own persona and magic comes out on-screen.This may not be perfection, but it is worth watching as a light-hearted romantic comedy. I enjoy it every time I watch it again. It's in my top-20 rom/coms of all-time not because it's a classic - but because all the pieces fit so well to make a fun movie experience.

It's directed in an old-fashioned way and that works fine. Cybill Shepherd as Corinne isn't bad in her role as the woman who can't get over her husband's death. She has a sexy maturity. But I can't say much for Ryan O'Neal as Philip, because he is, at best, nondescript. He may be adequate in the role, but that's not good enough.However, I get the feeling that some of the characters, particularly Alex and Miranda, are not written with enough in-depth thought. We don't know anything else about them because minutes after they appear the story gets thick, and the writers don't tell us much beyond what happens. But that problem was salvaged because Mary Stuart Masterson has a fresh-as-a-daisy sweetness to brighten it up, and Robert Downey Jr. is so charming that he melts the screen. Even his smile is infectious. And it so happens that his big dreamy eyes are perfect for the deja vu and flashback scenes.Anyway, this movie is light and easy and if you like them that way, why not give it a try.

I actually like her, but the haze was distracting.Watch this movie as part of a romance movie marathon with Return to Me and Moonstruck... two other movies that are just pure magic.

I mean, how can you have a bad movie with Robert Downey Jr. in it,none have and ever will exist. He has the ability to brighten up any movie with his amazing talent.This movie was perfect! I saw this movie sitting all alone on a movie shelf in Blockbuster and like it was calling out to me,I couldn't resist picking it up and bringing it home with me. You can call me a sappy romantic, but this movie just touched my heart, not to mention made me laugh with pleasure at the same time. Even though it made me cry,I admit, at the end, the whole movie just brightened up my outlook on life thereafter.I suggested to my horror, action, and pure humor movie buff of a brother,who absolutely adored this movie. This is a movie with a good sense of feeling.It could make you laugh out loud, touch your heart, make you fall in love,and enjoy your life.Every time you purposefully walk past this movie, just be aware that you are consciously making the choice to live and feel this inspiring movie.Who knows? What if it could really happen to you?, and keep your mind open to the mystical wonders of life.

In a way I do not really detest romantic comedies, though I do find the silly Hollywood romantic ideals in these movie to be somewhat sickening. Chances Are is no different with everything working out in the end with all of the main characters happy in the end.The plot of this movie is based around a man, Louis Jefferies (Robert Downey Jnr) dying in a road accident and leaving his wife a widow. He gets to heaven, not really knowing where he is, and says that he must get back, so he is given another chance to live. He is given a lot of really nice positions but wants to get back to Washington. He comes back, but isn't treated so he forgets who he was. Twenty three years later he has graduated from Yale and meets a young lady in the library, he helps her out and she thanks him. He them moves to Washington and attempts to get a job at the Washington Post. Though he is refused a job, he meets a nice man, Philip Train (Ryan O'Neal) who invites him around to his friend's house. Through a peculiar twist of fate it lands up to be his ex-wife's house and her daughter is the girl he met at the library. Hollywood really knows how to stretch believability.The movie is supposed to be a confusing mixture of people chasing after each other and others running between bedrooms, but it really is not. Much of the comedy comes out of Louis Jefferies, who is now Alix Finch, realising that he was really Corinne Jefferies (Cybil Shepherd) husband, and then trying to convince her of that. It lands up with a clichéd Finch revealing all of his treasured secrets that only Jefferies would have known.Corinne is a lovely character. Okay, she is jumps into bed with Train the minute they fall in love, but her devotion to her dead husband is beautifully admirable. She is so tied up with her dead husband that she spends a lot of time at the psychiatrist to try and get over her obsession.This movie is also quite predictable I know what Hollywood is like. I knew Finch could not get back together with Corinne, leaving both Train, and Miranda Jefferies (Mary Stuart Masterson) out in the cold. I know that they all must be satisfied at the end of the movie, the only question was how that was to happen.This movie is based around the theme that Louis Jefferies is back from the dead and everything must work out. There are obstacles that the characters must overcome, but this movie is a fantasy and thus reality needs to be twisted a little. Even though what happened in heaven is false, not only is it a place where good people go, but people can have a second chance at life if they want. Earth is portrayed as a playground for the rich and the poor are really just animals that get in the way.

However I did not derive half as much pleasure from watching it as I did with those other two films. Perhaps because the actors please me less than in the other films. Anyway it was pleasant enough to watch and the end was fairly predictable. The music, with several pieces from a Johnny Mathis CD I have was most enjoyable. One feels however that the plot was a little lacking in substance to produce the emotion felt with other films in a similar vein such as the two I just mentioned or, for example, PEGGY SUE GOT MARRIED. Also the whole thing is a little bit ambiguous because one wonder's how LOuis can fall in love with his wife and daughter at the same time. Anyway a little knock on the head followed by a long overdue injection clears up that little problem at the end. So in short, not bad but could have been better and more emotional !!

Before you can say déjà vu, Downey begins to understand he's the reincarnation of the woman's beloved...and that her playfully flirtatious daughter is actually his child too! Tasteful, easy-to-take romantic comedy written by Perry and Randy Howze mixes sentiment and farcical elements rather smoothly, and director Emile Ardolino keeps things moving fast, but there's nothing of substance here to make the film meaningful (or even memorable). When the Howze team do attempt a sense of seriousness (as with Ryan O'Neal telling Cybill Shepherd the only man to ever come back was Jesus Christ), the movie comes to a halt. There are some good performances, particularly by Shepherd (very low-keyed) and a twinkling Mary Stuart Masterson, but the picture is so cozy and glossy it practically evaporates. ** from **** "},{"Title":"Lightweight, but watchable","Date":"9 October 1999","Score":"2 out of 5 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Fantasy, Romance","Review":"  A lightweight romantic comedy that's harmless enough. I particularly liked Masterson - she's really the only standout here. The plot is pretty basic for what it is, except for one crucial element that I think should have been explored more. The relationship between Downey and Masterson is played largely for laughs - he's actually her father's soul in a different body, and she becomes attracted to him - but it brings up all sorts of serious issues that are never discussed. I know, I know, it's just a light comedy - and normally I could forgive something like this, but for some reason it really bothered me. I mean, even Back to the Future dealt with this situation in a more sophisticated way. Nevertheless, it's aesthetically watchable and not a complete waste of time if you're not expecting too much.

When Louie died and had his soul put   into another body, he and his wife should have overcome this and be   together regardless. It's a disaster that Corinne ended up marrying her   dead husband's best friend in the end. I don't know how any person   with a heart could do such a cruel thing. Also, the movie ended in a   horrible way. Alex, who is Louie with a different body, should have   somehow gotten his original body back. And reunite in a loving way with   his wife. After I finished watching this movie I was extremely   disappointed. The director did an awful job with this movie. I think   anyone would realize this. The ending of the movie killed the entire   film. Robert Downey Jr. is a great actor. I can't understand why he   even accepted such a role. I would never want to be in a movie like   this. This is the worst movie I have ever seen in my whole entire life.   Just disastrous, awful, terrible, disgusting.

You could know director Emile Ardolino from 'Dirty Dancing' and 'Sister Act' and should expect something amusing from him. But I guess I have to disillusion you.

The baby grows up Robert Downey Jr, and Jr returns his former home town where she meets his former daughter, Mary Stuart Masterson (complicated, huh?).They fall in love with each other. Then appears Jr former wife, Cybill Shepherd, and Jr falls in love with her too. I guess I don't even have to mention that she loves Ryan O'Neil.In one of his first roles Robert Downey Jr's on his worst. He copies Michael J Fox.After the 'Moonlighting' Shepherd proves that she's not suitable for acting in movies.Anyway, there's one thing this unfunny comedy can be used as antidote to insomnia.

Too bad they had to waste the talents of Robert Downey Jr., Cybill Shepherd, Ryan O'Neal and Mary Stuart Masterson.At least it's a pretty tame film, language-wise.

The first half was pretty well done overall, with Alex Finch dying and being reincarnated in a new body (played by Robert Downey Jr.). He meets up with his wife (Cybill Shepherd) and friend (Ryan O'Neal) and his daughter, who is now grown up. The scenes with them meeting again and Downey rediscovering who he once was are well done, and there is a good amount of emotion and happiness once Shepherd finally believes its really her husband reincarnated, but from there the film goes downhill. There are several sex-related scenes that turned me off completely, especially Downey and Shepherd wanting to get together again despite the difference in their age now. After that, however, the film manages to end in the most satisfying way possible, considering the circumstances of the plot. I was disappointed because I did not expect the film to become so immoral by the end. There was great potential with this story, and the scenes in heaven are well done. There is a good theme song sung by Peter Cetera and Cher, but ultimately the film is not great. For a better, similar film, try Heaven Can Wait. Decent, but I really kind of wish I hadn't seen it because of the scenes in the second half.*** out of **** "}]
