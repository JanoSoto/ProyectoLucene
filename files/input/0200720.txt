She gives the performance of her life and it sickens me she got no recognition for her efforts. Her subtle acting and graceful demeanour make her perfect in this role. Its so hard to get as excited about the other characters in the movie as she seems to steal every scene. I am a massive fan of Merchant & Ivory films but this production just blows them out of the water. Everybody in this film are excellent - the dialogue is beautifully spoken and the lack of music in it makes it even more real and lifelike.I can say only two words to describe this film, and i quote Lily Bart (Gillian Anderson) -  HOW DELICIOUS.

A must see.In all honestly Davies direction does take some getting used to. No quick editing for him! Yes the pace was slow, it concentrated on the actors faces longer than usual. However I felt this was necessary in order to show the tension of the people and the lethal nature of the words spokenThe cast were wonderful. Stoltz was ideal as Seldon. He was cool and suave and attractive. I also enjoyed Laura Linney as Bertha -she really sold me on being a very nasty woman. The main star, Gillian Anderson, performed with grace, poise and charisma. This woman can convey emotions - just look into her eyes. She does not need to speak to tell you how Lily is feeling. She was mesmerizing. For example, when Lily was flirting with Seldon you somehow could feel her discontent.Her descent into hell was  heartbreaking.  One scene, when Lily is at her lowest, will stay with me for a long time. The hopelessness was obvious, as if she was slowly dying. She was beyond caring for anything - and it showed in her eyes - dulled and weary.Gillian Anderson brought Lily through a myriad of emotions. We loved her, pitied her, wanted to slap her! She was cynical and manipulative, a total flirt and then she fell. The gamut of emotions Anderson went through was incredible and to take the audience with her was a miracle.This movie leaves an impact. It will not be a blockbuster (too intelligent and too wordy for that.) God forbid should we make an audience pay attention and think in a movie. The movie, unlike most period dramas, really brought home how nasty life was. Vicious and unforgiving to those who did not play the game.If you can, go and see it. I promise it will be worth it.

If you need a driving soundtrack to tell you exactly what mood you're supposed to be feeling for each scene, you're going to hate this movie. If you can't accept the fact that flawed characters develop but don't always overcome in the end, you're going to hate this movie.OK, now that the summer action flic viewers have stopped reading this review in disgust (just as they left this movie early), we can get on with the review. I think Gillian Anderson was a good pick for the part, and did a very good, if not quite excellent performance. Part of Guilded Age/Edwardian upper-crust behaviour was the semblance of civility under the most trying of circumstances, such as saying Thank You when you've just been fired or otherwise dissed. Add that to the stylized English and you end up having to PAY ATTENTION to understand what is going on to get it.One of the brilliant aspects of casting is the Gillian Anderson pick. Instead of a brilliant blonde or smouldering brunette, you have a non-conventional look (short, voluptuos and red-headed) that jolts (and excites) the modern eye, but actually better fit in to the pre-Chanel standard of beauty of that time.At its heart the novel is a morality tale, describing the pitfalls of being beautiful, manipulative and shallow while failing to be cunning and wise. Lily Bart is callous to her suitors at first, only to fall into multiple social traps. In the end she relies solely on her integrity and dignity, which is insufficient to extricate her from her circumstances. This may offend many who expect the heroine to prevail in the end due to a simple basic morality (which is there in Lily), perseverance (which is also there), a clever plot twist and a 40mm grenade launcher (both missing).Lavish sets, beautiful backdrops, gorgeous costumes, good acting (with the possible exception of Akroyd), all make this a surreal, if sad, journey for the cognitively aware and patient. I say possible exception because of one subtext of the novel & movie is the interplay of the American Nuveau Riche and the old nobility of England and Europe. Thus the wealthy American Entrepeneurs are depicted as brutish and obvious, though this is tolerated in society because their path was already blazed in the 1890's by the first wave of gold miners, oil drillers and electric company tycoons that swept through Europe and married into storied, if not monies, bloodlines. Thus, Akroyd's blatant and crude manipulations and language are somewhat justified.But, if you don't like period pieces, costume dramas, and identifying with wealthy people who have never worked a day in their lives, all this will be lost on you.

This admittedly languorous film rates ten out of ten for me and ranks close to Fanny and Alexander for its emotional control and depth. Get the DVD!  With $8.7 million Terence Davies did what Scorsese could only impersonate with Age of Innocence, and which Merchant and Ivory haven't done for a long time. Davies has created the suffocating, cosseted and unforgiving social milieu of New York and Tuxedo Park circa 1905-07. The sets, the sense of place, the stunning cinematography of Remi Adefarasin (Elizabeth), and most of all Gillian Anderson's virtuoso performance combine with Davies' excruciatingly seductive pacing and scoring cues to track in loving detail the missed opportunities and downfall of Lily Bart. Every line Wharton used to describe Lily's inner life is there in Anderson's face and in Davies screenplay and direction. If the film feels stiff to younger viewers, it's because it's deadly accurate socially. That gilded society WAS stiff, unforgiving and precoccupied with keeping out the nouveau riche. Anyone who has tried to gain entry to a social register or the DAR might have a easy time understanding the upper class world of New York in 1905.I must commend Davies for the risky choices he made in casting Eric Stoltz as Lawrence Selden and Dan Ackroyd as Gus Trenor. Ackroyd's boisterous girth works here because Gus Trenor is both gatekeeper and gatecrasher of this social circle. He and his wife are major forces in deciding who's in and out.  Ackroyd is not the deepest actor, but neither is Gus Trenor deep. In fact he's to great degree, a backslapping facade. Despite his wealth and high standing, Trenor is pragmatic and doesn't turn his nose down at courting filthy-rich newcomers desiring social elevation - men like Sim Rosedale (Anthony LaPaglia) - if it means Trenor makes a buck. And yes, Eric Stoltz is not a convincing choice for a romantic lead, yet he's perfect for the role of Lawrence Seldon, since Seldon balks repeatedly at being Lily's leading man anyway. The sexual charge and arch, ambivalent fencing between Lily and Lawrence is intensified by something indescribable that happens between Stoltz and Anderson in every scene played between them. I can't figure out why it works, except that these two fine actors found each other. Stoltz's tenor crispness - his not quite boy, not quite man-ness - adds to his character's elusiveness, cowardice and vulnerability. Finally, Laura Linney is devastating as Lily's reptilian nemesis, Bertha Dorset. For me, she evokes some of Glenn Close's lethal devilishness and charm. It is Lily's sense of propriety, her fine upbringing, that makes her incapable of finishing off Bertha in when she can, and should.Davies' laser accurate sense of place and character sets House of Mirth apart. He's successfully created the last years of Wharton's treacherous gilded world, when carriages were what fine people still rode and automobiles were considered vulgar. Davies' production designer, art director and set decorator have created sumptuous yet stifling enviroments where Davies and his players can move us back one hundred years into a time we can only imagine and smell when we tour a Vanderbilt Mansion. And he did it without Titanic's budget. It's clear from his commentary that Davies had to repeatedly make do and it sounds like this production was a struggle. All I can say is, limitation is sometimes a fortunate mother. I hope Davies, now 57, will soon be up and running with a new film. I'm suprised to see no new project listed yet. If I were a producer, I'd pounce. This director has the magic. And excuuuse me...! No new projects listed yet for Gillian Anderson?A short note to the Snatch fans that have dissed this film here  I loved Snatch too, loved it, but where's your freakin' RANGE kiddies? SNATCH and HOUSE OF MIRTH were my TWO FAVORITE films of 2001. Tell ya what. Go back to your videogames and Hollywood spectacles and only comment on classic adult film when you've spent a few more years watching much of the worlds great film literature. If HOM is too slow for you, let your hormones rage for a few more years and come back when you're ready to pay attention to human, not cartoon, reality.  Meanwhile, don't drop your smirking, restless, impatient and limited verbiage on films like this one.

Davies is not interested chiefly in either scenery or costume - that is, in history as a heritage theme-park - but in the story, its themes and characters, and in teasing out good performances from his cast. The modest budget of this film works in its favour. Most of the best scenes and shots are framed in intimacy, not lost amidst panoramas of superficial grandeur or the shallow aesthetics of Merchant-Ivory-style film making.At the heart of Davies' film is Gillian Anderson's brilliant performance as Lilly Bart. Since she is on screen almost all of the time the film really stands or falls by her performance. She sheds her X-Files persona in moments and conveys an enormous range of subtle emotions as her character vacillates between an almost involuntary avarice and moral scruples, foolishness, charm, fortune and tragedy. The affect of Anderson's performance is lasting and deep. Indeed, this film lives on long in the memory and continued to trouble me for weeks after I had seen it.

Althought the movie is set in the early 1900's, her struggle with making a life for herself while surrounded by treacherous friends with their own agendas feels completely relevant. Working from a terrific script, Anderson draws nuance, meaning and emotion from her lines and the circumstances in which she finds herself, as she puts it, doing the wrong thing at the right time. The journey she took me through in this movie was invigorating, thought provoking, engrossing and ultimately heartbreaking. The supporting cast, including Day Akroyd, Anthony LaPaglia and Terry Kinney, hold their own and fill out the movie beautifully. But Laura Linney deserves special mention as Lily's cunning, manipulative rival posing as a friend. Although very much a period piece, the film goes beyond some of the best pictures of Merchant-Ivory in bringing to life Wharton's novel, presenting a darker movie about the consequences of choices and the cost of guilelessness in a ruthless world. It also pulls Scully out of her basement and into the spotlight where her talents deserve to have her.

The precision and depth with which the director and actors go is absolutely true to the novel in almost every respect.Gillian Anderson is a revalation here, she perfectly captures the repression and pain of being a woman stuck in that time and place with no way out. You can feel her pain and torment in every quivering close up, and the passion contained in her kissing scenes (or to be more precise, her NON kissing- kissing scene) with Eric Stoltz is something to behold.Eric Stoltz is equally amazing in one of the most complex and difficult roles for a man to play. I must disagree with the viewer from China, Mr. Seldon is NOT meant to be terribly masculine or deep voiced or unbearably handsome- those are modern readings that perhaps we expect from the role of the 'male hero' in modern films- but here Mr. Selden is written exactly as he is played- walking a fine line between what is correct behaviour for the time, and what he was or wasn't allowed to do in regards to her rescue. He is torn by love of Lilly Bart and the realization that he is not the right man for her, as the all important social scene would frown on their union. The actor portrays this ambiguity perfectly, and I for one found it a relief that the man didn't ride in and save the day in that cliched movie way.I also must commend the supporting players of Anthony LaPaglia (whose role Sim Rosedale is originally written as a Jewish man, one of the few changes made to the n script adaption of the novel) and Laura Linney as Bertha Dorset, the 'bad girl' of the story. They both bring a life to the story that is rare to see in a period film, most actors seem to be too afraid or respectful of the material to really bring it to life.I even enjoyed Dan Ackyroyd in a role that I didn't see him in or expect to like him in. I suppose my feelings about him are coloured by old Saturday Night Live shows, or Driving Miss Daisy, but I think he was terrific in a role that is not the most explored in the novel or the film.Everything about this film held my interest and moved me, and I'm a very tough audience as far as Wharton goes. The pacing is indeed slow, but if you give yourself over to it it is like taking a warm bath in a quick shower world.Very well done!

It's a great story and great looking, but the real surprise in Terence Davies' adaptation of Edith Wharton's novel is how deftly Gillian Anderson among others manages to gracefully convey the stilted rigors of the period language. The film is largely about the traps and deceits verbal gamesmanship and class one-upsmanship. It is a deadly and vicious internal warfare that goes on with the upper class bourgeois in New York City in the early 20th century. The price one pays &#150; particularly that a woman pays &#150; for straying too far from the unwritten laws of that society can be severe. Lillie Bart's flaw is not really in her indiscretions, but in her inability to compromise at the right time. Her timing is fatally flawed. That the film is so relentlessly tragic, really takes the viewer by surprise, partly because Anderson gives her character such spunk and vivaciousness that you find yourself surprised by the endless bad luck that she brings on herself. Anderson's remarkable beauty, poise as an actress, facility with the dialogue, in my mind, bring her to a whole new level as an actress.It is also wonderfully cinematic.  There are rich colors and textures, beautifully framed scenes, marvellous costumes. Though steeped in tragedy and melodrama, you'll find yourself so swept away in this world that it will seem centuries and not merely decades removed from our time. Perhaps this is why the titles at the beginning and at the end are `New York 1914' &#150; you need this reminder by the end.With a host of good performances and a rich sense of place you will get emotionally and imaginatively swept up in this world.

Though it seems there is no relief from suffering for Lily Bart once she starts her tragic descent to say that this film is an unrelenting grievefest would be unfair. The film is basically divided into two halves and the first half showing a somewhat frivolous Lily amongst her many suitors contains many upbeat moments and is peppered by some witty exchanges between the characters. The second half of the film is very effectively introduced by the kind of long tracking shot that Terence Davies is renowned for as the action shifts from America to Monte Carlo and Lily's descent becomes the main focus of the movie. One thing that is very obvious about the film is the almost total lack of incidental music. Everything is driven by dialogue and the subtle interactions of the characters. The lack of music creates many moments of silence (or near silence with ticking clocks, etc) and this gives the film a hermetic quality which may not be to everyone's taste. A certain claustrophobic feel is not unknown in Davies' films but the lack of music is a new departure. Another feature about the film is the emotional restraint required of the characters, particularly Lily who despite undergoing grievous torments does not break down until close to the conclusion. Fortunately, Gillian Anderson proves to be perfect for this sort of role. The nuances she brings to her character, with an unending variety of subtle expressions and delicate movements of the eyes, allow us to see how Lily is repressing the emotions and passions within her, until it is far too late. Only the most hard-hearted could fail to be moved by her performance and it is in the middle part of the film, where the compromises she endures start to chip away at her frivolity, where she truly begins to shine. Other performances are suitably accomplished, particularly Laura Linney as the sinister Bertha Dorset who is central to Lily's downfall. Davies' insistence on a literal and austere interpretation, in part due to the miniscule budget, may mean that this film is not geared up for being a mass-market vehicle. Those whose idea of a period drama comes from watching Gwyneth Paltrow may find the genuine authenticity that House of Mirth supplies, with it's clipped accents and formal constraints of behaviour, a little too hard to take, though I find Davies' interpretation far preferable to that of others in the genre.

Of course, there are those people who find its pace too slow. However, one must realize that this is a period drama; it's not meant to be an action-packed suspense thriller. Everything is subtle, but it is so beautifully prepared, thought out, and executed by all.1. Were it for nothing else, the technical aspects of this film would have kept me watching until the very end. The music was perfectly placed to rise and fall with the internal emotions of the characters - especially Lily and Lawrence - and to express the turmoil of the social downfall of Lily. On top of that, you have phenomenal costumes and set with the most lavish colors. Lastly, and possibly what I found most fascinating about the film, was the lighting. it always seemed just bright enough or just dark enough to reflect the romance or dreariness. In addition, there is just not denying that the way the light fell upon Gillian Anderson in every, single scene is something I have never seen before.2. The all-star cast! Gillian Anderson. Eric Stolz. Laura Linney. Anthony LaPaglia. Dan Akroyd. Do I have to go on? I can almost guarantee that you'll find yourself, at one point or another, yelling at the screen. These characters are so manipulative and deceitful and malicious. And Lily is so naive and just won't accept love when it's given!! I think the best thing about the cast and performances in this film is that watching the film and listening to it are 2 completely opposite experiences. The actors convey one thing with their faces and another with their voices; it's pure talent. I was amazed.3. If nothing else, this film should watched purely for Gillian Anderson. This project was so different than her 'X Files' persona - and such a success, at that. The way she uses her eyes to express 5 different emotions in a matter of seconds blew me away.

(possible spoiler in penultimate paragraph)","Date":"15 November 2000","Score":"9 out of 11 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Romance, Drama","Review":"  This year has been an annus mirabilis for the period drama, a once-dessicated, inert, bourgeois-pampering sop enlivened by intellectual and formal rigour, cinematic innovation and visual beauty.  Now that 'Le Temps Retrouve', 'Mansfield Park' and 'In the Mood For Love' have set the stakes, certain famous practitioners (or embalmers) of the genre for a lazy, cinema-hating, I-don't-have-to-read-the-books-to-be-classy audience have been made redundant.  'House of Mirth' belongs to this iconoclastic group.  If the period film is traditionally concerned with offering pleasure - costumes, big houses and estates, decor, dialogue etc. - than 'Mirth' is not traditional - it is a relentlessly observed depiction of one not particularly remarkable woman's fall from grace, lingering particularly on her decline into the working classes (quelle horrible surprise!).  It is a rigorously austere film - the surface trappings are minimised, made deliberately artificial or obscured by dull lighting; the use of music is economical, what little there is comes from over a century before the drama is set, less lush, less wallowing, more ascetic, brittle, thin than contemporary late Romantic music would have been; there is no witty dialogue - the dramatis personae are either bores or monsters, all speak with elaborate stiltedness.  Moments of epiphany or beauty are rare; what few there are usually end in artifice, banality or irony.  This is a gruelling film to watch, especially in the second half; this doesn't mean that it isn't very moving, or beautiful in a non-superficial sense (much of the emotion comes not from the plot or characters' reaction to it, but Davies' subtle camerawork).Edith Wharton's story is basically an elaboration of Henry James subject matter, a showing of what he conceals or implies.  There is the same horrified fascination with the machinations of class - a viewer has to be quick and alert to catch what's going on, the rules and transgressions only acknowledged by a look, or a seemingly irrelevant sentence, but which have devastating, life-threatening consequences.  Davies doesn't offer us a traditional fall from grace narrative - it is clear from her opening scenes that Lily is no grande dame about to be felled; she is barely hanging on to a hierarchy that barely notices her.  Her first appearance announces Davies' intentions as she emerges from the dense steam of a railway engine in a dank railway station.  As she walks in the centre of a perfectly symmetrical composition against a neo-classical background to neo-classical music, she looks out of place, almost out of time, a dark silhouette, with no visible features, like the shadow or ghost she will eventually become, or like a strange, mocking figure of 18th century Venetian theatre, with her strange, birdlike hat. This sense of weightless rootlessness also makes us enquire about her elusive background - Lily literally seems to emerge from nowhere.  She is slowly, but definitely, thrown from the unwritten laws of society to a very real material social order, reduced to making hats badly for a living.  Her sense of time altars radically too - although society life seems a distinct realm from the 'real' world, there is a noticeable narrative flow, in spite of all the gaps (and this is a film so full of narrative holes, you often think you've been nodding off) and temporal elisions. But when Lily joins the world of work and time-keeping, narrative time seems to suspend - narrative events don't seem to follow coherently, but in a blur; when Lily first takes laudanum, and the camera floats out the window to the babble of voices from Lily's life, we assume she is dead.  Of course, in a sense she is, and this painful second half is like a nightmare hallucination, as Lily floats away from whatever tenuous moorings she ever had.  Her opening scenes with Sheldon have a brittle, nervous quality that initially seems false and irritating, until we realise the full extent of Lily's plight, her ineptitude for the role she is required to play - Gillian Anderson's performance is remarkable, as quietly tragic as those great actresses of the 30s and 40s, her face doing all the acting as she registers the horrors she cannot verbally acknowledge.

If you have read the book then clearly the writer/director Terence Davies has taken a few liberties. But so much script has been lifted word for word from the novel that I think he can be forgiven any eccentricities. This is a story of manners in early twentieth century New York and environs. Everyone seems so decent and 'proper', but each plays their own manipulative game. No-one (with the exception of Sim Rosedale) tells the truth. As a morality tale it seems as relevant today as when Edith Wharton wrote it. Davies has succeeded in losing none of its mood or punch by transferring it to screen. Unfortunately I think this is a film that requires watching more than once as some explanatory scenes appear to have ended up on the cutting room floor. Generally the acting is excellent throughout though I felt that at times Davies's enthusiasm for detail hamstrung some actors where others appeared to have relished the close direction.

Officially it is an international co-production, but it was not only made by a British director, Terence Davies, but also shot on location in Britain, even though most of the action is supposed to take place in and around New York. (As a keen birdwatcher I have to say that I could tell that it had been shot on this side of the Atlantic from some of the typically European birdsong in the background). It is, in fact, a good example of the sort of costume drama at which the British film industry has traditionally excelled, although there have been some notable American examples such as Scorsese's The Age of Innocence, also based upon a novel by Edith Wharton.The action takes place in 1905. At the opening of the film its heroine, the socialite Lily Bart, appears to be living a charmed life. She is young, beautiful and the niece of the wealthy Mrs Julia Peniston. Yet her position is more precarious than she realises and the film traces her downfall from wealth into poverty and from respectability into social disgrace. The title is deeply ironic; this is a tragedy, not a comedy, and there is nothing about Lily's position that might arouse mirth. Wharton took her title from the Biblical book of Ecclesiastes The heart of the wise is in the house of mourning; but the heart of fools is in the house of mirth.The implication of this title is that those who live merely for mirth or pleasure are foolish, and certainly Lily's downfall is partly the result of her own folly; she incurs, for example, large gambling debts which she is unable to meet. Yet it is also partly the result of the hypocrisy of American high society in the early years of the twentieth century. Although some Americans tried to pretend that theirs was a classless society, the ultra-rich of New York could be just as ruthlessly snobbish as their counterparts in London, Paris or Berlin, and just as ruthlessly unforgiving of those who fell foul of society's unwritten rules. Lily's reputation is damaged not only by her gambling habit, which alienates her puritanically religious aunt, but also by an untrue allegation of an affair with a married man. (The allegation is made by the man's wife, who wants to distract attention from her own adultery). At times Lily's own good nature works against her; she has the opportunity to revenge herself on the woman who has unjustly accused her, but refuses to take it because to do so would also compromise Lawrence Selden, the man she loves.The star of the film is Gillian Anderson, which surprised me when I first saw it in the cinema as I had previously only though of her as that bird from the X-Files or the girl who, a few years earlier, had been voted Most Beautiful Woman in the World by the readers of FHM magazine. (This aroused some ungallant comments from members of the anti-redhead brigade, who opined that Gillian had only won the title because readers had confused her with her namesake Pamela). The House of Mirth, however, proved two things. Firstly, it proved that Gillian was a much more versatile actress than I had hitherto supposed. Secondly, it proved (to my satisfaction at least) that she was far more ravishingly beautiful than Pamela Anderson ever knew how to be. Her Lily Bart is one of the great tragic heroines of modern cinema; I was reminded of Nastassia Kinski's performance in Tess, another period drama about a beautiful young woman who struggles vainly to escape a cruel and inexorable fate.There are other good performances from Laura Linney as Lily's accuser, the spiteful Bertha Dorset, from Dan Aykroyd (an actor I more normally associate with comedy) as the financier Gus Trenor who unsuccessfully attempts to seduce Lily, Jodhi May as Lily's quiet but scheming and hypocritical cousin Grace Stepney, who eventually inherits Mrs Penistone's fortune and Eric Stoltz as Selden.Like many British period dramas, the film is beautifully photographed and makes use of some sumptuous sets and costumes. My one criticism would be that, in the early scenes it moves too slowly, but the pace gradually quickens as Lily's tragic drama is played out to its climax; the ending is particularly moving.

Anderson is perfect in the role, and we feel all of her emotions. The superb cast includes Dan Aykroyd and Eric Stolz as two of her suitors, and Anthony LaPaglia, great as always, as a man who tries to help Lily out despite her pride winning over.Davies' direction is incredible, one scene is simply of an empty house as it rains and it is just mind-blowing.

This movie interpretation captured Wharton's acidity towards NY society more than Scorcese's Age of Innocence did, which focused more on personal failings. Here a magnificently beautiful Gillian Anderson's character is stupid and stubborn, but doesn't really do anything wrong that society manipulates and revenges on her. She is absolutely superb with a very wide-ranging performance and it's a real shame she's being overlooked in end of the year awards.The costumes are absolutely gorgeous. Having worked at a Hudson River estate museum I thought the movie absolutely captured the feeling of those hazy summers out of the city then was astounded to see it was all filmed in Scotland (which would explain the rocky coasts that were the only thing that confusingly didn't look like the Hudson).The long movie is a bit slow and I think my mind wandered such that I missed a crucial plot point here or there - not sure we needed all the twinkling on the water shots. Laura Linney plays against type as a practically evil duplicitous friend (worse than her wife in The Truman Show).It was interesting to compare this to Jane Austen interpretations which tend to emphasize the humor of her pot shots at silly society figures, but those folks were in small towns, not the big leagues where raised eyebrows affect fortunes. For society types, this is The Show. Ebert (and my mother) gave it negative reviews because they absolutely refused to believe that a woman in her social class in 1906 had no other choices besides marriage but I think it was historically accurate, as Wharton was writing, bitterly, about a society she had observed (in a line from George Eliot to Hardy's Tess and Crane's Maggie). The women coming out of the theater agreed that we'd want to see it again.(originally written 1/28/2001) "},{"Title":"A Fine Film With Great Emotional Depth","Date":"7 June 2001","Score":"4 out of 5 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Romance, Drama","Review":"  POSSIBLE SPOILERS AHEAD.Director Terence Davies sensitively directs a fine group of actors who portray the characters in Edith Wharton's most famous novel.   THE HOUSE OF MIRTH is an excellent art house presentation with the added allure of Gillian Anderson in the uncharacteristic role of Lily Bart-----a beautiful, vulnerable, but shortsighted woman who knows what she wants but is driven to pass up every opportunity for a brilliant marriage to a scion of New York society.  Miss Anderson's personality is a bit too modern for the role of Lily, but she does a commendable job in the part.  There is perhaps a bit too much of a feminist message in her comments on a woman's role in society.  We are, after all, seeing the events of a century ago, and judging the past by present day standards always gives the sense of belatedly condemning history.  But despite the cross-cutting of emotions, class and subtle sexism, the general theme of the story is that most people find out the truth about themselves and their milieu too late.  Eric Stoltz is remarkably affecting as Lawrence Seldom, a man who understands Lily, the world, but not himself.   The scene in the garden at the Trenor party where he and Lily almost declare their love for each other is one of the most memorable I've seen in years.   Anthony LaPaglia as the social climbing businessman and Dan Aykroyd as the lustful Gus Trenor are right on the mark with their characters.  Terry Kinney as the weak-willed George Dorset has an understated intensity that few actors could successfully convey.  Laura Linney as his malicious and scheming wife Bertha turns in an excellent performance as the woman who dramatically delivers the coup de grace to Lily's social ambitions.The standout for me, though, is Jodhi May who plays Grace Stepney.  Her face can show conflicting nuances of emotion that deeply affect the viewer.  Where has this actress been hiding?  There are scenes between her and other actors where she is saying one thing, yet conveying quite a different meaning to the audience through her facial expression that are positively heartbreaking.  One scene in particular has her turning Lily down for a desperately needed cash advance in the full knowledge that her denial will end in tragedy for Lily.  She denies her the money for supposedly moral reason, yet has tears of regret in her eyes because of the jealousy that is making her do it.  Portraying a conflict of emotions in a single character is a rare talent and Miss May's ability is magnificent.Let's hope we see more of this very gifted actress and that her next role will be more prominent.  Hers is a performance not to be missed in a film of great emotional depth.Jay F.

Rules of engagement in high society are no different from those of a society of primates. Had Anderson's character as a child adopted a different set of values, her view of her own self-worth would have been different. Social acceptance exacts compliance fueled with the fear of rejection. Though I am a big fan of God, I can only admire His plain simple, written truths because I myself quite frankly am not strong enough to follow them. The Bible clearly warns of the dangers of placing in man's hand the trust and dependance of which only God himself is worthy. In this, Anderson's 1907 character and the character I play in 2004, we are equally guilty of the same errors of judgment of our own self-worth.

However, her reputation begins to suffer due to her circle's misreading of an innocent situation, and things go from bad to worse for her as she descends down the social strata. She has it in her power to win back everything she has lost but refuses to stoop that low due to her love for one man.It's obvious that Davies took a great deal of care with this film. It is not infused with modern sensibilities, the period look is authentic, as is the look of the cast. By that I mean, Gillian Anderson's sumptuous red hair, full beautiful face, and lovely figure are much more period than, say, Gwyneth Paltrow's -- and yet films are rarely cast with an eye toward capturing the period in that way. The casting of Dan Ackroyd as Trenor is unusual but very right - he's not truly of the class he travels in and a real glad-hander. Eric Stoltz is Selden - handsome without being drop dead gorgeous, gentile without being effeminate, who has good chemistry with Anderson.The villainess of the piece is Laura Linney as the awful Bertha Dorset, a cunning witch, and as usual, Linney is perfection -- smiling, subtle, and you can just see the knife going in. In the book she is more responsible for Lily's troubles than in the film. In the film, we see her making initial trouble for Lily; in the book, she continues to work on destroying her with a whisper here and word there.What makes the story of Lily so frustrating is that she can ruin Bertha in five minutes but refuses, suffering instead, which drove me crazy. That's not the film's fault.This was an era where no one expressed emotions, so when someone says, thank you or I understand, there is a world of meaning to be read in the eyes. It's a world of artifice, and Davies obviously worked at getting this from his actors. Everything is in what lies beneath.The acting is uniformly excellent; only Gillian Anderson falls a little short of the mark. Lily is an extremely difficult role, and Anderson at least in 2000 did not have all the necessary skill to completely pull it off. She has the look, the bearing, and the intelligence. What she lacks is the ability to actually become someone of that era, rather than putting it on like an overcoat. She does much better in the latter part of the film, which calls for a different set of acting muscles than in the beginning.Reminiscent a bit of Sister Carrie, The House of Mirth points up the difficulties of women in that time period to make their way, of the boundaries of class, and the rigidity of the upper class. Highly recommended, but not an easy, cheerful film by any means. "},{"Title":"Beautifully done central performance carries another Wharton wallow in misery","Date":"12 August 2011","Score":"2 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Romance, Drama","Review":" If this film adaptation depicting lives ruined by the social mores and hypocrisy of turn of the century upper crust New York society seems to have a lot in common with the similarly plotted The Age of Innocence, it would be because authoress Edith Wharton was responsible for both novels. Unfortunately, like The Age of Innocence, this is yet another wallow in victimization and misery that Wharton seemed to specialize. However, unlike The Age of Innocence where director Martin Scorsese seemed psychotically obsessed with the elegant trappings at the expense of his story, director Terrence Davies is actually more interested in the players of his piece.The primary player is one Lily Bart (played by Gillian Anderson), a lovely, elegant young woman, who not only bungles her chance at true love, but comes to realize to her detriment how much she is at the mercy of a fickle high society filled with pettiness, envy and jealousy.Lily is at heart that rarest of beasts - a genuinely decent person. She has had the misfortune of accumulating a sizable debt from card playing, which she anticipates paying back with the inheritance to be left her by harridan aunt Eleanor Bron. As Bron is infinitely more taken with dishrag ward Jodhi May, it is questionable how much Lily can count on this development. Lily pines for scandalous attorney Eric Stoltz, who is the sometime lover of society grand dame Laura Linney, but finds bad timing and circumstance consistent obstacles to a relationship. In fact, bad timing and bad luck seem to relentlessly dog Lily in every endeavor. Trusted friends and companions reveal themselves to be bitter enemies beneath the surface. When some scandalous letters fall into her lap that would prove to be her personal salvation, Lily takes the high road to her further detriment.The House of Mirth does not have much mirth in it. It is depressing, gloomy and leaves the viewer in an utterly hopeless state. It is a despairing experience to watch the destruction of a person, who did not invite it, does not deserve it and is left broken and battered by life, while some appalling specimens of humanity glide past unscathed. This is by no stretch of the imagination an enjoyable viewing experience and one would imagine that it would be an even more trying reading experience.All that aside, there are definitely reasons to watch the film. Davies' assured direction and the fine literate screenplay being two of them.Another compelling reason would be Anderson's central performance. Anyone who is only familiar with Anderson from The X-Files and oblivious to the stellar acting she has also contributed to British TV and films, will most certainly be impressed with the appealing, nuanced and heartfelt performance she contributes here. What makes Lily's inexorable downward spiral a spirit crushing blow is that until the final moments where she confronts her dismal future, Anderson never plays Lily as a victim. She seems entirely too self-assured and confident in her quest to do the right thing. The climactic moments where her emotional walls crumble at what life has in store for her is a powerful sequence. The entire performance is a demonstration of understated grace.The supporting cast is strong with one notable exception. Linney is matter-of-factly monstrous as society force of nature Bertha Dorsett, who throws Lily to the wolves on a whim to make herself look better. Terry Kinney is sympathetic as Linney's cuckolded husband. When he makes an offer to Lily late in the film that would make both of them whole, it comes across as a meeting of two lost souls and one is disappointed that Lily does not take him up on it. Dan Aykroyd is terrific playing against type as a joyfully manipulative scoundrel.Unfortunately, the film is thrown off-balance by the miscasting of Stoltz in the pivotal role of the scandalous lothario that inspires so much consternation among the female characters. I usually find Stoltz underrated, but here he is all wrong. Pasty-faced and limp, Stoltz adopts an effete fey attitude that is more off-putting than attractive. It reminds one somewhat of the miscasting of John Malkovich in Dangerous Liaisons. It is difficult to believe that one woman would find him irresistible, but the fact that three women are in such ardor over him as to launch campaigns of betrayal on each other strains credibility at every turn. Worse, Stoltz barely registers a pulse when Anderson shares the screen with him so that it hardly seems that Lily is letting much pass her by with this colorless smelt. He seems less like an unrequited love than a chance acquaintance. When Lily makes the ultimate sacrifice to spare his reputation, it seems like a wasted effort. This casting leaves the important unrequited romance between the two characters a bust. And while it may be believable that a milksop like May would be enamored of Stoltz in this film, it is inconceivable that a being depicted with the voracious appetites of Linney's Bertha Dorsett would stoop to inspect him much less expose herself to vulnerabilities to chase him. A really foolish bit of casting here that nearly throws the film off balance.

Finally I was able to watch it from the beginning. And I am glad I did. I have not read Wharton's book of the same title, but plan to now. I have to know the background of Lily Bart and everyone involved in The House of Mirth.The casting of Gillian Anderson in the lead role was genius. Anderson's beauty is unparalleled and her performance should have been Oscar-worthy. She captures Lily Bart with all the emotion that one can ask for. She is snobby, selfish, sympathetic and sorrowful. You cannot help but want her to win. I was drawn to the movie because I am a fan of The X-Files and I was glad to see the actress who played Scully leaving her comfort zone for a once-in-a-lifetime role. Eric Stoltz also gives a memorable performance as Lawrence Selden. I could tell immediately that he was in love with Bart, but also knew her too well. He knew that she would never marry for love and so he never proposed. But you can see the jealousy in his face when she is being courted by other men. The kissing scene was marvelously done and kept me wanting more. And his weeping over her corpse at the end of the film is heart-breaking. Other big names who appear in the movie are Dan Aykroyd as Gus Trenor and Laura Linney as Bertha Dorset. Both are intriguing and fun to watch. Anthony LaPaglia also appears in the film. At times, I found myself almost wanting him to win Bart. Almost. A period-piece, the costumes are stunning and at times, real. The director had some of them using real clothing from the turn of the century. The women even wore corsets; this helped them appreciate what women went through at a time when they were still considered property. Wonderfully directed, acted, costumed and everything else, this movie has stuck in my head. I look forward to reading the book and learning more.

Visually it's every bit as beautiful as their films, (or for that matter Scorcese's Age of Innocence) but to Davies credit far less self congratulatory. There are no self aware moments of the camera loving panning the meticulously designed sets and costumes in effect demanding our attention as to  how wonderfully  a bygone era has been recreated. There are shots in which equally meticulous backdrops are skimmed over. They are in fact what they should be, backdrops, with the focal point firmly on the characters.  Davies thankfully steers clear of using theatrical stalwarts in favor of actors not associated with this genre. It's a risky tactic which in the hands of a lesser director could have gone horribly wrong. Dan Ackroyd, Eric Stolz and Laura Linney seem completely at ease in their roles, but the real surprise is surely Gillian Anderson.The House of Mirth is a tale of the downfall of one Lily Bart and as such it's clear the film would succeed or fail on the strength of the portrayal of this central character. With Gillian Anderson's unexceptional big screen record, casting her in this role was certainly a gamble. It's one that pays off immensely. Her performance is up there with the best.One has to view the film with the same mind set as one would  picking up an Edith Wharton novel.

Alas, Edith Wharton's, The House of Mirth was such a novel.  Despite an effective screen play that is faithful to the book, and uses much of Wharton's dialogue, the movie is talky and often slow.  Despite these failings I give high marks to the cast, particularly the luminously beautiful and charismatic Gillian Anderson, as Lilly Bart, and Anthony LaPaglia as Sim Rosewood.Wharton's story is intensely sad and often bitter.  It's characters, members of upper class New York Society a hundred years ago, talk in a code that is difficult to understand without Wharton's helpful narrative.  I particularly missed this in the film because Wharton was an acute observer of that milieu and was very, very smart, to boot.  Despite the absence of Wharton's narrative, however, the film has merit.  Lilly Bart is a tragic heroine in the classic sense of the word.  Like Hamlet, she is her own worst enemy because she cannot commit to any given course of action, and her problems are exacerbated by ill luck and genuine evil committed against her.One note on the quality of the print I saw.

However, I'm a big fan of Gillian Anderson and had heard great things about her performance. My main fear was that I wouldn't be able to see her as more than her X-Files persona, which is how I've always seen her, despite her playing very different characters in Chicago Cab and The Mighty. I must say, I was very surprised by this movie- not only was it a cut above the usual Jane Austen-type fare, but Anderson's performance in the lead is simply mesmerizing. Never for a moment did I see anything in her but Lily Bart, this character that she disappeared into completely. It is a travesty that she wasn't given more attention when Oscar time came around. She is supported by such familiar faces as Eric Stoltz, Dan Aykroyd, Laura Linney, and Anthony LaPaglia, all of whom give excellent performances.

I know Terence Davis is not everyones cup of tea but when you get use to his direction this film instantly becomes a classic. It is beautifully shot and even though he has made some major changes to what is a complex book it has not been over simplified. When I saw this film I can remember thinking that it will not go down well in America it was made on a shoe string and Mr Davis is not one for glossing things up, but seeing the positive reviews from the critics it seems I was wrong. As for the casting well I must admit I was unsure about the casting of Ms Anderson in the roll of Lilly but having seen the film it was an inspired casting choice. One of the best performances I have seen for years, she gives a subtle and intelligent portrayal of Lilly well deserving of the Best Actress Award she won at the British Independent Film awards lets hope justice is done at the Oscars.

There was a self-consciousness, a kind of deliberateness about it that distanced me somewhat.  Obviously not enough to destroy the overall pleasure of the film.  Laura Linney was, as usual, marvelous, fully into her character.  Eric Stoltz gave a convincing performance as the stiff, repressed Lawrence Sheldon...and managed to convey a strong sexiness nonetheless.The movie's theme (as in the novel) is certainly a feminist one...How a woman untrained for any work in the world is totally dependent on her social position, reputation and the kindness of strangers.  But how she can maintain a high moral stance, despite the cruel and spiteful gossip that destroys her...tragically.  There is an echo here of an old flick, Quartet, with Isabel Adjani in a similar situation.It is certainly a movie I'd recommend and will undoubtedly see it again.

There are many film adaptations of literary works out there, and many succeed because they remain faithful to its written counterpart.  But Terence Davies took this one much further than that.  He took that extra step of portraying the same feeling the book actually gave.  He successfully recreated Edith Wharton's novel visually, without adding the fluff that would normally act as the distinguishing factor between the two formats. With the beautiful sweeping long shots and time-lapsing transitions as a backdrop, Davies sets the tone for Lily's tragic, slow downfall and internal struggles throughout the film.  Davies did not depend on background music in order to convey the emotional state of each scene.  Instead, every scene was character driven, giving full credit to the talents of the cast.

Laura Linney sinks her teeth into her role and is suitably bitter, Eleanor Bron is formidable, Dan Aykroyd also comes across surprisingly well in a menacing and cunning turn and Jodhi May is charming and sympathetic. Terry Kinney, Anthony LaPaglia, Penny Downie and Elizabeth McGovern are also very good. The best of the lot is Gillian Anderson, whose performance is magnetic and truly heartfelt, her last scene with Stoltz is just heart-wrenching. The House of Mirth is shot very elegantly and the whole adaptation's period detail looks gorgeous. The lack of music is a good choice, allowing the intimate, understated atmosphere of the storytelling speak for itself. The dialogue is distinctively Edwardian and very literate without being stilted, how it's adapted is very thoughtfully done and any observations of the attitudes and classes of the time are sharply done. The story takes its time to unfold which is not a bad thing, period dramas often benefit from this especially when it's adapted from complex source material, and thankfully this deliberate pacing is not done in a self-indulgent way. Narratively The House of Mirth is incredibly touching and rich in theme and character, allowing you to identify with the characters(written and characterised believably) and with the interactions and the emotion it always maintained my interest. The direction is very intelligent and subtle.

Last year I hold my underwhelmed apathy towards Davies' THE DEEP BLUE SEA (2011, 6/10), my first Davies film entry, but a closer DVD viewing of THE HOUSE OF MIRTH greatly galvanizes my affinity to Edith Wharton's convoluted story of a woman's inept battle with the hypocrites and the iniquitous of the well-heeled echelon near the beginning of 20th century in New York, it is the dramatic demise of an unsullied soul, there is no mirth at all. Anderson's Lily, an ill-fitted maiden of upper class, sustained by her wealthy aunt Julia's (a ghastly Bron) charity, balks between her passionate desire with a lower class lawyer Lawrence (Stoltz) and her promising marriage with an upstart Sim (LaPaglia), to whom she has no feelings at all, meanwhile a bad investment or a guileless trust to the wrong man (Aykroyd) corners her into a financial predicament, which subsequently creates discord between her and Julia and eventually will cost her the endowment of the inheritance. That's not enough, she is also manipulated to be the pull-upon by her friend Bertha (Linney), while the most excruciating fact is that Lily has the substantial evidence to give Bertha the tit-for-tat, but she can never make up her mind to do it (out of self-respect or the dread of destroying Lawrence's reputation since he is the other partaker in the affair). So Lily is a woman of dignity, even when she is utterly at the end of her tether (she has to take a menial job to earn a living, which she will be dismissed for her incompetence), she refuses to take Sim's succor, her ill-fated life succumbs to a plaintive dirge of an irreversible tragedy.Davies conducts the film adeptly with elegant costumes, shady light compositions, the interior murkiness augurs the dark-amber and midnight-blue tinctures in THE DEEP BLUE SEA, grants melancholy its most suffocating ambiance to submerge audiences' compassion, the score of classical orchestra makes the story even more poignant. The film is also a victory for its cast, Gillian Anderson (I have never watched the X-FILE series and its movie spinoffs), under the bridle of the corset, most of her time her breath is visibly confined into an asphyxiated discomfort just like her character's situation, performance-wise, it may be her once-of-a-lifetime glory, carries out the emotional roller coaster throughout, shamefully it is less acknowledged. Eric Stolz, whose tender tune undergirds his man-child debonair, shows his best form as the man who fails to save his beloved woman. Laura Linney, pretty much nails the virulence and slyness in this less-known work. Jodhi May is great in turning on the waterworks but her character overall has been skated over. Admittedly I have a predilection towards period dramas, and I may miss out some literal undertones of the proficiently organized conversations by Wharton and the dramaturge (Davies himself), but the film is so close in my top 10 list in such a strong year.

Sometimes you don't need those very big and expensive actors like Brad Pitt to make a film work.This film attempts to stand high on how good the story is and how well written and acted it is, something which can be a lost art when big budgets, special effects and big actors come into play, where they hope those alone will make a movie big.People are not that stupid.This movie has elegance. I even had a lump in my throat for goodness sake towards the end. It simply should not happen to a grown man.

From a fine old family, she nevertheless has very little money. The big bucks, instead, belong to Lily's aunt and Lily makes her home with this lady. It is assumed that when the aunt passes away, Lily will inherit. Meanwhile, Lily hobnobs with the cream of society, a mostly married circle of friends that includes Mrs. Bertha Dorset (Laura Linney) and her husband, single gentleman Lawrence Selden (Eric Stolz), and Gus Trenor (Dan Ackroyd) and his wife. Naturally, our Lil must keep herself looking smart, so her aunt complains about clothing bills, and Miss Bart secretly plays cards for money. This last would upset her aunt, if she knew, so Lily tries to cover her tracks, as she does get an allowance. But, all too soon, her debts are high and she must set her cap on making a rich marriage, even though she may be harboring an affection for Mr. Selden. Its all for naught, you see, because Selden is not rich, either, but a lawyer climbing the ranks. A good match would be Percy Gryce, as far as money is concerned, but he is a bit priggish. When Lily flirts with him at a party, she sleeps late the next day and misses church. Away goes Mr. Gryce, only to marry another wealthy lady. Another rich gentleman, Sim Rosedale (Anthony LaPaglia) likes Lily and being Jewish, needs an blueblood wife to advance in society. However, since her heart is not in it, she turns him down. Learning of her desperation, Lily's friend, Mr. Trenor, says he will invest some of her money to increase her spending power. Too late, Lily discovers that he expects romantic favors and she refuses him. Bertha becomes jealous of Lily, too, so the circle of friends cast Lily from the group. Hoping for her aunt's money, Lily is stunned to learn she is mostly cut of of the will. What will she do to survive? This is a classic tale by Edith Wharton, one of America's best writers ever. Wharton came from the high society of old money New York and she knew it through and through. Lily is a most tragic figure in that she is beautiful, witty, and charming but that is not enough without money. Alas, she also throws away her chances for stability at every turn. Anderson gives a sensitive and wistful performances as Lily while Linney, Ackroyd, Stolz, LaPaglia, and all of the others do great work, too. The costumes and sets are to die for while the direction has a careful, studied touch that aids the tale. No, don't watch this one if you are not having a mirthful week. But, if you want a good cry or are looking for a film of substance, choose House of Mirth.

Show me even acommercial for Howard's End or The Wings of the Dove and I'mslumbering like a baby inside of a minute.  I'm not sure, then, why Iwent to see House of Mirth.  I'm not an X-Files fan, whichmeans Gillian Anderson wasn't a draw for me, Eric Stoltz playedhis last good role almost seven years ago in Pulp Fiction, I lovedLaura Linney in You Can Count on Me, but I don't think I'd see amovie just for her, and Dan Ayckroyd can't even remotely be takenseriously anymore.  So why *did* I go?  The buzz, I guess.  Theword on the street was that House of Mirth is a great film, and so,against my better judgment, I sallied forth.  And in this case --pardon the switcheroo -- the buzz is absolutely 100% correct.Everything I dislike about period pieces is present here -- therestrictive manners, the uncomfortable-looking costumes, peoplewith names like Sim Rosedale -- but this time around it didn'tbother me.  Much like Dangerous Liaisons, one of House ofMirth's big themes is exposing the conventions of the time asoutright hypocrisy.  By the end of the film, we see the era'sstandards as being almost solely responsible for its tragicresolution.  And I can certainly get behind that.  In short, theconventions aren't just window-dressing; they're a subtleaccomplice which allows the characters to behave as they do.  ButI get ahead of myself.House of Mirth tells the story of Lily Bart (fantastically played byGillian Anderson -- her performance almost makes me wish Iwatched The X-Files), a woman in turn-of-the-20th-century NewYork who defies all the things that women of that period aresupposed to do she plays cards, she doesn't want to get married,she kisses men who look like Eric Stoltz in a chaperone-lessapartment.  This seems to be of great concern to everyone but Lily;she's having a fine old time, regardless of what everyone elsethinks.  But then she gets into money trouble with Gus Trenor (amarvellously miscast Dan Aykroyd -- so miscast that after a while Iwas actually cheering for him to pull it off), which leads to publichumiliation at the hands of Bertha Dorset (the wicked LauraLinney), which leads to an ever-steepening downward spiral,revealing Lily's supposed moral turpitude for all to see.  Houseof Mirth is a tragedy in the Greek drama sense of the word, withLily's tragic flaw being her unwillingness to change, her reluctanceto conform to the dictates of society.  I won't give away the ending,but tragedies, as we all know, end badly.The film is an adaptation of Edith Wharton's novel of the samename, and I fully confess to sitting there in the theater with a biggoofy grin on my face as writer-director Terence Davies layered theplot twists in ever-tightening spirals.  It is the strength of Wharton'snovel (and Davies's adaptation) which makes the movie work; thesource material (unlike the execrable Hannibal) is impeccable.  Imention this because the acting certainly doesn't help matters any. Anderson, as I mentioned, is fantastic, revealing Lily's characterwith equal doses of anguish and steel, and Linney, while not asfine as in You Can Count on Me, is good, bitter fun.  The rest ofthe cast, though, won't be collecting an Excellence in EnsembleActing trophy anytime soon.  Ayckroyd I've dealt with, Stoltz is asunintentionally weaselly as ever, Anthony Lapaglia (as theaforementioned Rosedale, one of Lily's suitors) is Smarm Central,and Terry Kinney (as Laura Linney's husband) just looks mopeyand sad all the time.  That this didn't detract from the film is atestament to Davies's work, and the excellence of Wharton's novel.House of Mirth isn't a good movie to see for anyone looking for aswell night out on the town (then again, nothing released so farthis year fits that particular bill), but those of you who prefer arsenicto sugar will like this immensely.  Our current crop of screenwritersand directors could do much worse than examine this film for amaster class in how to execute a complex plot, and how a film'ssetting can be just as much a villain as any flesh and bloodcharacter.

However, the atmosphere quickly becomes more foreboding as Lily Bart (Gillian Anderson) begins her downward social spiral.  Thus begins Terence Davis' masterpiece.I did not enjoy the film on my first viewing.  The dialogue seemed stilted, the plot seemed unbearably slow, and every single actor seemed stiff.However, I've greatly revised my opinion of the film since I learned more about life at the turn of the century and thought  about what themes Edith Wharton was trying to convey.If the actors initially seem stiff, it is because  the story they are playing out is set in a time when manners were far more formal than they are now.  Also, many of the characters are giving performances of their own. They do not say or do what they really mean, but rather change their behavior in order to manipulate the people around them.Gillian Anderson, as Lily Bart, has the most difficult performance within a performance and she rises admirably to the task.  A viewer must carefully watch her face at the beginning of the film to see the emotions Lily is really experiencing. The truth is that Lily, unlike her friends, is not genuinely at ease in the fake world in which she lives.  She pretends to be, however, and thus it is not until the second half of the film - when Lily's fall from grace is nearly complete - that Anderson is allowed to unleash her full emotional range.  She gives a powerful performance, brilliantly conveying Lily's desperation.Also excellent is Laura Linney, whose Bertha Dorset is the sort of person that is so charming that they never get the credit for being the nasty villains they really are.  Anthony LaPaglia is wonderful as a social-climbing businessman who initially seems callous - but may be the only character who is truly honest.  Eric Stoltz, Dan Aykroyd, et al. are sufficient though unexceptional in their respective roles.The film is still relevant today because of its portrayal of society. People still trade their chances for true happiness in exchange for professional success, and social ostracism can be just as hurtful.  Between its excellent acting, meaningful story, and fabulous direction, The House of Mirth can fairly be called a modern masterpiece.

It is also a tragedy of small proportions, made much larger by Gillian Anderson's clever acting of the lead character, a woman who, on the surface, is quite dislikable yet has a vulnerability under that hard exterior that eventually leads to her downfall.  Anderson has made an art form out of strong women who burst into sobs, and she is quite good at it.

This film gave her a full range of emotions from being a beautiful socialite with many admirers, to being manipulated, confused, and finally self-destructive. The first hour of the film was rather confusing and tedious because it showed her moving among people who were the idle rich. I guess this set the mood for how boring her life really was. Perhaps she wracked up debts from card playing to bring some excitement into her life. When her aunt died, she was cut-off from any real inheritance. From a sense of honor, she became the prey of people who really sought to use her. Yet, her sense of honor kept her from becoming just a mistress or from marrying just anyone so that she could have the lifestyle she knew. The second half of the film was more interesting as we saw her declining into poverty, an addiction, and despair. The real sadness was that none of her so-called friends came to her rescue without strings attached. When she was forced to work at common jobs, she was excluded from her circle of friends. In the end, you have to admire her for her struggle to retain self-respect. All in all, it was a very good film. With her excellent credentials, Gillian Anderson will have a life beyond the X-Files.

Gillian Anderson from the X-Files puts together one of the most compelling and intimate performances on screen. With a quiet patience and attention to detail, the persona on screen evolves through the movie towards an almost fatalistic climax. As a member of high society at the turn of the century (20th) New York, the highly rigid gender role expectations of Anderson's character are clearly on display throughout the movie. The movie moves in a delicate psychological dance, the slow pacing quickening with an emotional disturbance of a rumbling earthquake by the end of the movie. Anderson brings a superb performance with her entire character period thrust together with the audience into another world and into the center of movie magic as it should be performed. This haunting and sobering movie is great and is worth the initial build up which then speeds towards its inevitable ending.The House of Mirth joins along with the more aggressive masculine performances of Michael Douglas's Falling Down (1993) and especially William H. Macy's devastating performance in Edmond (2005) and contrasts with the more lighter fare of Diane Lane's character who nevertheless focuses a more contemporary spurned female character in a foreign country in Under the Tuscan Sun (2003) or the bigger than life fare of Salma Hayek's role as artist Frida Kahlo in a culturally diverse biographical performance in Frida (2002), Natalie Portman in an emotional intimate drama as a ballerina in Black Swan (201), or the ensemble performances that have strong period brush strokes as found in Pride and Prejudice (1995). Perhaps, Kevin Spacey's performance in American Beauty (1999) and most recently Leo DeCaprio's performance in The Great Gatsby (2013) have even more of a similar resonance with The House of Mirth even with Beauty's contemporary societal setting or Gatsby's outlandlishly stylish presentation.My thanks to The Tower theater in Salt Lake City, Utah for bringing real motion pictures to the state in 2001 and again to the Fox television affiliate in 2013.

Based on a novel written in the early part of the century, such a film must fight the very likely possibility that the material will seem stale. The story is, of course, not a new one. But it is Wharton's characters that come through to make this tale unique. And Davies' skill as a director that ultimately makes it work. Consider, people from this era were trained to never reveal themselves. Their joy and despair is always telegraphed as serene calm, lest it ruin their social standing. Davies use of close-ups help bring the audience to a closer proximity with the characters, especially Lily Bart. We can see her face, study it. It is not perfect, though we can tell it once was, just a few year prior, probably. When we see her face share the frame with Lawrence Selden's, we feel their proximity, realize how the social structure would drive insane anybody whose brain dared to think beyond it. And so it goes.So although I felt some elements, especially at the close of the film were a bit cliched, I could truly see what was at stake, and could feel the tragic system at work. Even Selden's final scene, the soul of filmic cliche, has a cathartic element that makes it rise above being just another period drama.

Anderson is excellent as Lily Bart in a film that does not quite capture the world Wharton so expertly illustrates, and we are instead given the core of the story without the Lily's background and personal demons. Her need to be accepted as part of nineteenth century New York society and her utter failure to do so work to show us Bart's character as one Edith Wharton must have known once personally. The casting of Dan Aykroyd as Gus Trenor is a major error here, but fortunately Eric Stoltz' Selden and Laura Linney's Bertha add to Andersons performance to save this film from obscurity. To modern readers more used to New York Times Bestseller fare, i.e., Grisham, Crichton and Stephen King,  Wharton's prose can only be alien, but for the patient and contemplative reader there is some of the best work in American literary history. For that reason, any film maker who ventures to put her work on the screen had better be up to the task. Here director Terence Davies takes a good stab at it, but comes up just a bit short. No doubt his cut of the film was a full hour longer, and some Hollywood suit ordered him to cut to the chase.

On that premise, I expected a grand tragic figure out of  Lily Bart, willing to sacrifice her own social position and even her life for the man she loves and her own principles and dignity.What we have in Terence Davies's precious and exquisite vision, is a plain dumb and vain socialité who never actually makes a commitment or is willing to work hard for what's best for her. Some examples1) Wants a rich husband but deliberately misses all her chances to please a suitable candidate. 2) Would like to marry the man she loves but never really becomes serious about it, she'd rather keep the flirtation game but doesn't even play it well. 3) Is aware of a friend's betraying practices but never realizes she could be framed. 4) Needs money but never really develops useful skills or work for someone willing to help her. 5) Likes to gamble and to smoke but is to afraid to become a rebel. 6) Would love to inherit the money from her aunt but seldom pleases her.DOES SHE EXPECT THAT ALL FAVORS COME FROM HEAVEN JUST BECAUSE SHE EXISTS?I know we all could be somewhat fools and fall into subtle traps as the ones presented in the film, but watching her so stupidly fall into them is despairing.

However, being in this country for more than quarter of a century, I started appreciating the old literature. I saw several adapted films like The Age of Innocence, Pride & Prejudice, The Wings of the Dove, Lady Chatterley's Lover and this one. They are inspiring and worthy of spending time on. One thing appealed to me was the dialogue. You can learn some good English writing from them. People felt bored because they usually did not have actions more than talking, walking and eating in the scenes. The excitements were well hidden in between the lavish conversations and well- planted landscapes. The details of surroundings prelude the story in front of you if you care to look for them. Lily was a tragic figure at her time. She was not equipped to do cruel things to others. She thought to act upon. However, she was never able to bring herself to do it. The dreadful situation to her was over thinking. She also fell in love with a subtle playboy which might be more perilous to her than a flamboyant one. She looked for love in the meantime also the security. The ideal match rarely goes together even nowadays. Nonetheless, we are reluctant to blame her for her own destiny. We might make the same choice as she did just we are living in the different era now. Whatever choice we made present no threaten anymore. On her own account, her lack of knowledge or you may quote ahead of her time thinking caused her dire end. Just like Lawrence told her she did not have that kind of upbringing to become successfully independent. Those views will not be disconcerted in the modern days. But they were detrimental in the turn of the century. I do wish to see Lily and Lawrence would end together like most of Jane Austen's stories.

She spurned security by refusing to marry the suitor (Anthony Lapaglia) who could have provided her with a very nice life, holding out for the man she never could have (Eric Stoltz). She disgraced herself by gambling and incurring $9,000 debt, very deep for those times.

Left without money, Lily is forced to associate with various unscrupulous individuals, all in order to pay her bills and maintain her expensive lifestyle. But it's a futile endeavour. Trapped in a vicious cycle, the more Lily fights to escape her debts, the more she incurs debts, the more she is subject to slander/gossip, the more she is pushed back down the social hierarchy. Wealth and status, then, is oft a fickle thing that comes at a price. Elsewhere Lily's forced to turn her back to lovers (and private passions) in favour for financially advantageous marriages and/or relationships.Davies direction is dry and stuffy, his cinematography poor and his film as a whole more radio play than cinema. Some of Davies' visuals recall the work of such Edwardian painters as John Sargent and Carolus-Duran, only less inspired. Most of his actors are miscast, especially Eric Stoltz, Dan Aykroyd and Anthony LaPaglia. Welles' The Magnificent Ambersons seems to be an influence. The film at times tops best-of-the-decade polls, but to my eyes suffers when compared to other auteur period pieces (particularly those by Visconti, Kubrick, Tarkovsky, Kurosawa, Powell/Pressburger, Rossellini, even Ivory and Scorsese).The film was based on an Edith Wharton novel, to which Davies is mostly faithful. He removes some of Lily's associations with the working class, keeps Lily's tragic ending, and, though the film is filled with vicious, conspiring men and women of power, never questions why we should be rooting for Lily to regain her status in genteel society. The film's acting has been praised, but this is TV level Edwardian drama, mannered diction mistaken for historical authenticity and/or good acting. The exquisite, razor sharp conversations of Wharton have been preserved, but perhaps should have been ejected completely. Better to keep things visual. If not, go the Hawks root, and fire dialogue like a machine gun. Davies film is too slack, and spends much of its time repeating the same motions.7.5/10 &#x96; Worth one viewing.

The American society at the beginning of the 20th century does not seem to resemble too much to the land of all opportunities described in many other literary or cinematographic works. Lily Bart, the apparently apparently frivolous character who stays in the center of the action is smart and beautiful, apparently high in the social hierarchy but too poor to be allowed to make her own choices and play a different role than the one of the well-married girl, or of the woman supported by rich and powerful men. Her refuse to surrender to the social pressure ends in catastrophic results.12 years only after it was made Terence Davies' film looks much older than it's age. A team of TV stars from the 80s (Eric Stolz), 90s (Gilian Anderson) and 2000s (Anthony LaPaglia) do more than a decent job, but I felt like the adaptation to screen borrowed some of the stiffness of the social environment described in the story. More passion, more nuances in the relationship between the characters would have made this film more interesting. Gilian Anderson is a great actress but her discrete acting seems pushed one step too far, her breaking down comes too late to give meaning to her self-sacrifice.

First, she makes the huge mistake of offending her aunt, her primary source of income, by losing money at cards, then makes it worse by naively entering into a dubious scheme with a caddish married man to pay her debts.

Under the veneer of civility, traps and malice abound.Soon, however, we focus on Lily Bart, a woman who seems to be all surface; we spend the rest of the film discovering depths that she herself probably didn't suspect she had.  Circumstances cause her to change; it is a fascinating portrait delivered in the most careful, nuanced artistic fashion by Gillian Anderson.  The viewer need only look into her eyes to know how Lily, a creature who lives by the surface appearance of things, is feeling inside.  It is a voyage of self-discovery and a discovery of what the others are truly like in one's world.  Lily is the passenger who eventually sees and realizes all.  It is a magnificent performance, surely worthy of Oscar notice.  Anderson's subtlety and artistry cannot be overstated.The rest of the cast is good, but not on Anderson's level.  Stoltz is disappointing, but then he has the thankless task of playing a character who has little character.  Ackroyd's Gus Trenor is one-dimensional and he handles the role easily.  Davies has rewritten Rosedale, and Anthony Paglia does a terrific job in showing the various sides of this social-climbing man.  The characters of Grace and the aunt slide over the edge into melodrama, but these are not major flaws.Davies removes several elements from the novel and combines two of the characters.  It works.

Time after time, she does foolish, cowardly things -- but she is never coarse, cruel or vulgar. That is what sets her apart from the rest of New York society, and that is why she must die.Unfortunately, director Terence Davies and his star Gillian Anderson both fail to grasp Lily's essential charm. The Lily they create is dumber, lazier, weaker, and greedier than her literary prototype. Each classic scene is redone in a way that makes Lily less a sensitive soul and more a luckless tramp. Instead of being an angel fouled by gossip she's simply a sexy girl caught with her hand in the cookie jar.In the book when Lily and Lawrence Selden chat it's purely a meeting of kindred spirits. They enjoy each other's company, certainly. But there's no real sexual tension, let alone heavy breathing. In the movie Lily all but devours Selden with her eyes, and the effect is comic rather than tragic. Poor Lily looks so heated and rumpled leaving his flat that it's entirely reasonable for outsiders to get the wrong idea.The same problem mars Lily's relationship with the women in her set. In the book Lily falls in with cruel Bertha Dorsett only because she's naive and innocent. In the movie it's obvious that Lily longs for the luxuries and pleasures of being a perpetual house guest, especially when Bertha and Bertha's husband George are paying the bills. Watching Lily moan with pleasure on the massage table while sly Bertha promises her an extended Mediterranean cruise totally underlines the wrong point -- that Lily is weak and easily tempted, not refined and easily misled. And it's even more ridiculous when Lily's shown gorging herself on fruits and ices, resting in the shade while sly Bertha plants rumors in the ears of the gentlemen that she's easy and available! In the book Lily's story is excruciatingly sad. In the movie it's sleazy, tawdry, and often unintentionally funny.

Davies draws us in to her world, laying bare both her noble and arrogant sides and giving us conflicted feelings about her eventual fate.  On one hand, her adherence to her principles is admirable, yet on the other it is difficult to pity her when her decadence and inability to compromise almost assure her doom.I cannot rave enough about Gillian Anderson's performance in this film.  Prior to this film I had little regard for her acting ability, assessing her to be a one dimensional character actor propelled to cult status by a popular TV show.  Taking this part was a monumental risk for her, shedding the familiar bonds of her emotionally contained Scully persona to take on a character swirling in a volitile hurricane of emotion.  She handles it magnificently.  Her performance has great volume, reaching far, wide and deep into her character's psyche and bleeding it effusively onto the screen.  After seeing this tour de force performance, I am left wondering why she wastes her time on television (I guess her multi million dollar `X Files' contract might have some bearing on it).The rest of the cast is barely adequate to the task of supporting Anderson.  Dan Aykroyd is miscast for this part.  He simply doesn't have the sinister side that the role requires.  Eric Stolz' character is supposed to be very stolid, but Stolz so understates the character that he comes across as lifeless and wooden.  Laura Linney is the best of the supporting cast portraying Bertha Dorset as charmingly diabolical and affected.This film is a wonderful throwback to the days when the story mattered.  Its classical underpinnings give it a tragic richness you don't see much anymore.  I rated it a 9/10.  It requires a patient and intelligent viewer, but for those who appreciate powerful character studies it will be a treat.

The film is also rich with lush photography and poignant music - mostly operatic numbers that gorgeously accentuate the pictures on the screen.The only real misfires of this film are Dan Ackroyd playing the villain (he should stick to his strong points - and they sure aren't acting!) and the women who play Lily's Aunt Julia and cousin Grace.  These two actresses suffer from extremes of over- and under-acting, respectively.But this film lasts in the memory, just sitting on the surface waiting for its flame to be rekindled again and again and again.Must-see!

You can practically see him remembering his lines and looking for his marks.  And I've liked Eric Stolz in other things, but he's a ghost here.  He's certainly not the Laurence Selden Wharton created; he's not strong enough or interesting enough to hold up his end of the thwarted love at the center of the story.  Finally, Gillian Anderson tries hard--which wouldn't even necessarily be out of place, since Lily tries too hard, too--but there's just something missing, and whatever it is, it kept me from identifying with the character.  I felt sorry for her, and understood what it meant for a woman of her time to fall as she did.  But I spent the last part of the movie trying to understand how all her relationships had come apart, rather than staying with Lily emotionally.On the good side, Laura Linney's Bertha was quite evil.  That her petty unhappiness could have brought about another's woman downfall strikes the clearest note in the movie.

To say this was not Eric Stolz's best movie would be nothing short of charity. The only two actors worth watching were Elizabeth McGovern, whose character was affable, even likeable, and Gillian Anderson. Yes, it did take forever for me to warm up to the plight of the heroine, and yes, she was awfully clueless. Yet, by the end, I found myself sympathizing with her. But let's face it, the only reason for watching this film would be to indulge in the remarkable beauty of the lead actress. Nowhere have I seen her more captivating. I'm not an X-files fan, and have only seen enough of Gillian Anderson on TV to get a more or less mildly favorable impression. But every actor must have a period, and a look that stamps them indelibly in the minds of their viewers. Kate Winslet had her moment of glory in Titanic, Sean Young defined herself eternally in Blade Runner, the impression of Sigourney Weaver (and Mel Gibson, for that matter) in The Year of Living Dangerously will never leave my mind, and Gillian Anderson has found her niche in this film, otherwise unnoteworthy except, perhaps, for the cinematography. If you have a weakness for a voluptuous, blue-eyed beauty in turn-of-the-century dress, Anderson will get to you. I thought her emotions registered nicely on her face, though the heavy breathing may have been a bit overdone. Too bad the writing and directing weren't worthy of what she obviously had to offer. Those who laud the film are too kind. It should probably not have been made, at least by this director. All is not lost, however; we saw an actress of whom it could be said that greatness (at least as defined in modern terms) was thrust upon her.

Edith Wharton adds a similar touch to this post-Victorian New York upper-crust melodrama, The House of Mirth. Welcome to the snake pit where a thick skin, acid tongue and perhaps a sense of humor will get you through the day. Ms. Anderson (Lily) is on the make and violates most of the Edwardian principles in private and public. She also uses a more potent elixir to arm herself during her descent into the working class. Among the bloodless techniques used to aid Lily's decline, we see blackmail with an ironic twist, snobbish intrigue, adulterous ruses and fundamental denial from many directions. If you liked Lily, you might care about her being jilted in the bachelor pad, at the altar, stiffed by an aunt who took Lily in and turned her out (Can you spell pariah?). And through all her pecuniary dilemmas, she manages to include more wardrobe changes than Erin Brokovich. Ms. Anderson's performance is far from her more familiar role on the X-Files (where are those alien kidnappers when you need them). I left feeling that some of her lines should be rehearsed before delivered to the camera. And oh those memorable lines delivered To Lily - if you do anything, do nothing, and This scene has been extremely painful to me, (and us too). Lawrence Selden (Eric Stoltz), Lily's lover/lawyer will befuddle you as he plays the Me Commit??? game throughout the film. And George Dorset (Terry Kinney) longs for the Steppenwolf days, or maybe that's me? Gus Trenor (Dan Ackroyd) is the investor/adulterer and generally bad actor reprises his Joe Friday - which is probably his Ghostbusters  - role so there's no reason to go just to see him. Bertha Dorset (Laura Linnet) is wonderful in her backstabbingly best as the treacherous wife and major contributor to Lily's demise.

Some of that I attribute to the directing.  She portrayed the awkwardness of the Edwardian rich girl trying to work very well, but her moments of tears and deepest emotion seemed pushed and maybe overacted.  Jodhi May, in her role of Grace, carried her griefs off with a lot more naturalism.The costumes and scenery were nice, but I didn't like some of the shooting.

But only in the first scene. Little by little, we see that she was going through some changes in her mind, before the movie begins. And she made her resolution, despite some doubts during her despair. We know that she had lost a great deal of money (and so her financial independence) in gambling. Particularly in Bridge, you know? That game that we are supposed to speak after the deal and before the playing itself. In order to be acquainted of your partner's game and by consequence your adversaries, too. But she didn't have the touch to play the game. It was too embarrassing for her playing by those rules. But at the beginning of the movie, she's really interested to know how to play by the rules. Unfortunately, she is quickly stopped by others who can't imagine her in that role. And she falls deeply. And it's her frailty in facing her determinations that eventually leads her to death.

I like Gillian Anderson movies, and I enjoy watching her on screen, but I couldn't say either of those things about this particular one.  The House of Mirth is a period piece, set in 1905 and involves a nauseating amount of characters, all with a different personal agenda, and all with different cards to play. But while there are several characters, the plot basically revolves around Lily Bart (Gillian Anderson), a well to do, good looking woman.  There aren't many things worse in the world than a woman who knows how good looking she is, and she does, and she uses it to her advantage.  Lily gets away with things that other women can't, until it eventually catches up with her.  She loses her money and her good name because of few little indiscretions, and is left with some decisions to make.  She must decide how to play her cards, knowing that they will affect her life and the lives of several of the other players.I'll be the first to admit that this is a rather brief and strange plot summary of the movie, but I just can't see it any other way.  Some might characterize this as the love that was never meant to be, as seen in Shakespeare in Love, and others might see the attempts of a woman to control her own destiny, as in Dangerous Beauty.  I'll admit that I saw aspects of both of those movies here, but I really saw a movie about one woman deciding if she wants to destroy the lives of others just to raise her own.  I looked at this as more of a poker game of life rather than a love story, and perhaps that might explain why I wasn't as impressed as many of the other critics who saw this.  As far as the rest of the movie goes, nothing really stands out.  The acting is decent, and the writing was fairly good, but I did have one glaring problem to report about both.  When dealing with period based movies, there has to be a line drawn between representing things as they were, and representing things that can be understood by today's society.  Shakespeare in Love did an excellent job in drawing that line as to highlight the best of both worlds.  The dialogue and accents in that movie weren't 100% Shakespearean, but it helped relate things to the current audiences that wouldn't understand it if it were.  The House of Mirth didn't draw that line so well.  I've no doubt that this is a very accurate picture of what society must have been like during the early 1900's, but that doesn't mean I could follow it.  The dialogue and accents here are good, but it's really quite hard to follow the plot and innuendos of the characters when they aren't speaking the same language as you do.  In those regards, Terence Davies, the writer and director, failed miserably.  I guess you could look at it in the perspective of such other movies as the Insider or Traffic.  Both of those movies went for the real heart of what they were showing, the critics loved them, the Oscar Committees nominated them, but they were a bit hard to watch at times.  They focused more on the content and making them original, rather than making the movie enjoyable for the masses, and they aren't very entertaining movies as a result.  That's exactly what I saw in this case.  The critics will love it, but quite a few of the people who see this, and are honest with themselves, will probably be checking their watches a lot, and wondering if their car is safe in the parking lot.  As far as movies go, it's not a bad one, but it is long, and it does get boring at times.

Wondering, that is, what you were thinking when you decided to watch this monotonous, slow, and incomprehensible failure of a film.Lily Bart (Gillian Anderson X-Files) is a turn of the century women who can't seem to find her way in the upper classes of the painfully socially correct.  She wants to play the game of the idle rich, but wants to play it by her rules.  She wants to be naughty enough to be noticed, but not so naughty as to be ostracized.Finding her finances declining, it is clear that she needs to find a husband who will keep her in the manner to which she wishes to become accustomed. But, she admits that men either fear her or detest her.  They are right to do so.  She proves over and again, despite the films attempts to get the audience to feel sorry for her, that she can't commit to anyone or anything except her own comfort.She finds that others play the game with greater skill, but she refuses to change her ways.  As she slides down through the social classes, eventually having to take employment she clings to her feigned dignity like the soiled and ragged garment she has turned it into.  It is not a pretty picture and, since it leads nowhere, is utterly without point in her life or to the audience.Near the end of the film she does one truly good thing in her life.  That noble gesture, however, becomes twisted in her own mind into an act of futility, desperation and defeat.  Clearly, this woman is so mentally ill that noble self-sacrifice and conceited flirtations are seen inverted in the mirror of her mind's eye.Compounding this intolerable boorish character is the stifled and stilted language of the film.  Supposedly the dialogue is written using the phraseology and grammar of the turn of the century American aristocracy. It's not clear that this is clear.  It sounds like the language of British upper class twits of the same era.  It seems unlikely that independent minded Americans would have dared to have sounded so painfully English.Even if the language usage is correct, using period specific language has a place and a time, but this prose (if it may dared be called such) isn't Shakespeare.  It's lethargic and uninspired.  This forced languages adds another layer separating the audience from the characters.Another barrier created by the film is time.  Long, long scenes of houses, rooms, forests, streets, etc. go by with no sound, no dialogue, no action. Yet, in another scene we suddenly shift from Lily having a tense and tearful discussion with her cousin to seeing Lily taking orders from an older upper class woman and jotting her instructions into a book.  We learn, later in the scene, that Lily is now in the employ of this older woman.   How this change, a step down the social classes from the idle rich to the working class of household servants, is never explained.Finally, the cinematography is beautiful, but deeply flawed.  A lengthy scene is shown of water playing off the bow of a yacht, but also includes a painful glaring image of the sun reflecting in the water.  Another scene shows a delightfully appointed formal dining room, with floral arrangements blocking the faces of the central characters.  And, while the movie is shot largely on location, several of the yacht scenes show amateur blue screen effects where the background does not move with the foreground as the camera shifts.In sum, there is nothing to recommend this film.

The way she talked and moved was extremely annoying, not to mention she was hardly beautiful, what is wrong with her mouth??? When reading the book I imagined someone like a hybrid between Grace Kelly and Veronica Lake. A graceful, sublime beauty. Not this annoying woman. The same goes for Seldon. Wasn't he supposed to be handsome too? Dear god, who the hell cast these people? This alone managed to ruin the movie for me. I would urge anyone to read the book, since it's masterfully written.

It casts a scathing eye on a society that offered so few opportunities for women, yet demanded that they live up to such an impossibly high standard of behavior.  In the story, Lily Bart (Gillian Anderson) comes to experience the subtle brutality of this tea-and-crumpets world, where favors come with hefty price tags of compromised virtue, where one's position of comfort can be suddenly obliterated at the whiff of a scandal or the utterance of a rumor, and where trusted friends, in such a case, can be the first to abandon one on the shoals of poverty - all in the cause of social expediency.  Taken as a bare-boned story, `The House of Mirth' is really quite interesting &#150; especially in its later, darker section wherein we see Lily stripped of all her social connections and forced to try to make her way in a world that has been designed to block her every move.  She becomes quite a sympathetic figure as the movie goes along.  But how long it takes us to get to the point where we really care!  For long stretches of this film, we find ourselves wishing it would at least pick up the pace somewhat.  We know that the film is not intended to be a fast-moving work, but `The House of Mirth' often confuses slowness and drabness with high drama and art.  Only in the latter stages, where the character connections finally fall into place and where Lily's plight becomes one with which we can identify, does the film truly pique our interest.The casting also seems quite problematic at times.  Anderson does a find job conveying the wistful sadness of Lily at the end of the film, but her hangdog expression seems inappropriate in the early scenes.  Eric Stoltz is far too much of a milquetoast as the man who might save her and Dan Akroyd is nothing short of an embarrassment as an older married friend who makes a move on Lily in exchange for some badly needed cash.`The House of Mirth' makes some profound statements about the plight of women living at the last turn-of-the-century.  I'm just not sure how relevant it is to women living at THIS turn-of-the-century &#150; except perhaps to show them how much better they have it now.

Better still maybe it should have been left alone.In a nutshell Gillian Anderson plays a young socialite of low means who is trying to marry rich but is frustrated by her love of a young man who is carrying on an affair with a married friend. Her character is so tragically in love with this man she sacrifices everything by accepting a scandalous disgrace rather than reveal the proof she has of the affair.While it's nice to see a film that does not unrealistically portray the position of women in the past and chooses instead to show the genuine struggles women went through this film doesn't do it in an engaging way. The main character is so weepy and spineless while all those around her take horrible advantage of her its hard to care. The dialogue occasionally shines when one can clearly recognize the clever line lifted directly from the original work; it is flat most of the rest of the time. It's hard to assess the acting when the rolls seem so unappealing. Anthony Lapagia is the only person to stand out both for acting and playing a character with some real sense. The chemistry between Anderson and Eric Stolz as her love interest is so lacking it is impossible to understand why this love is worth sacrificing a cab ride let alone one's entire life. Oh and after only a few days ago commenting on the refreshing turn Dan Ackoyd's career had taken with him playing a wealthy sex-obsessed sleazeball in Stardom I was astonished to see him playing an almost identical roll here!Perhaps worst of all the film rarely allows any moments of candor. The beauty of Dangerous Liasons was the shift between polite conversation and brutal honesty. Here honesty is all but totally lacking and film is poorer for it. Perhaps in 1905 these conversations were scandalously candid, now they are a yawn.I found myself checking my watch constantly and, after 2 hours and 15 increasingly excruciating minutes, I was `forced' to leave the theatre in time to make it to my next screening. I cannot even comment on whether the ending satisfactorily redeemed the movie. Given, however, that the movie seemed historically accurate up to that point and no plagues or disasters ravaged New York in 1905 that would suitably explain killing off the entire cast of characters I rather doubt it could have been redeemed.

On hand talent is provided by the likes of Gillian (X Files) Anderson, Dan (Ghostbusters) Akroyd.  Other faces you may recognise are Eric Stoltz, Elizabeth Mcgovern and quite a few more.The House of Mirth's story is a complex long winded one set in the early 1900s. Anderson plays a single successful 'well to do' lady in her late twenties who has everything she wants bar a husband.  Her success does not last for ever as her money soon begins to run out (this is just one of her many problems) so Dan Akroyd helps her out by investing money on her behalf but this back fires on her when she finds out that she owes him money and he wants payment in kind.  Another problem of Lilly's (Anderson) is that she is not getting younger and she is trying to find a potential husband but this backfires as she is having an on off flirtation with a smarmy but dashing gentleman (Eric Stoltz).  All of this grandiose story is wrapped up and served on a pretentious plate by critically acclaimed director Terence Davis, well know in intellectual circles for Distant Voices and Still Lives to name but two.Now obvious comparisons will be made to the Jane Austin-esque novel but this is of no concern to us as we are only saying how the film stands on it's own, as a film.  The House of Mirth is in one word disappointing.  From such an experienced director you should expect more cinematically exciting visuals.  There is, however, one point where this omission is briefly discarded.  Before a location shift to Monte Carlo, we are dazzled by an excellent array of flowing water and flickering lights.  Another applaudable feature of this film is the excellent Akroyd who, considering the material he had to work with, gives us the most interesting, but under used character of the film.  Alas these are but two roses in a sea on excrement covered thorns.  Now if the first section of this review had you confused as to what the film's premise is, you are forgiven, as the bitter truth is that when you see the film you will be so bored by it's sheer dull plodding story. You will get bored and your mind will wander and you wont know what is going on within one and a half hours.  The House of Mirth has no mirth or indeed any kind of merriment, even though they have one of Hollywood's greatest comic actors.  If there was some kind of intellectual undercurrent of witty comment on modern society I missed it.It is not Terence Davis' fault that this film is a disappointment, even though the fades between scenes are too long and the majority of camera work is stale.  The main problem with The House of Mirth is that the story is boring and the characters are lifeless.  The finger is firmly pointed at the story for not being exciting or even interesting.  Anderson does work hard at playing her role but the harsh truth is that she is a few years past playing this sort of character.  Personally I did not care what happened to self-pitying, false, pretentious Lily Bart.  You may feel I have been a bit hard on this film, but how about asking what the four people who walked out of the screening thought about the 'film'.  Some people may feel The House of Mirth is a masterpiece other people may not.  Maybe if this was not on at the cinema and instead was shown over a few Sunday nights on BBC 1 it might have come across as a little better, but as a film it did not cut the mustard and in the opinion of this reviewer The House of Mirth is at best an extremely effective insomnia cure.

The letters why did the cleaning lady bring the letters to Lily when they were signed by Bertha?how did the cleaning lady know who Lily was and where she lived? Was it the usual practice for young ladies to have one hundred dollars (presumably a very large sum at the time) about their person - Lily didn't even need to go to another room to fetch the cash... 2. How come Lily, a young lady living with her aunt, went all on her own to the opera with 2 men - neither of which was related to her? This seems very odd to me - after all one's reputation was very fragile I can't imagine this happening in Edwardian times. 3. Why did Lily not sell her earrings if she was short of cash? 4. Who was the duchess and why should she be invited to dinner - to impress who?? All in all, while the film seemed to drag on for ever none of the characters was properly developed and we kept meeting new and mysterious people. the whole story was quite uninvolving since we didn't really know who anyone was or their position in society. I assume Mrs Fisher was a lower rung than Bertha of the large yacht - as evidenced by her sloppy way of sitting!

Gillian Anderson turns in a compelling performance in the lead as this young woman, Lily Bart. But, as has been noted by others who've read Edith Wharton's novel, this is not a fully successful literary adaptation.The book is over five hundred pages long. To deal with such complexity, the writers have sliced it into tableaux, which give an imperfect idea of the narrative, and many details of character and incident are oversimplified, including the omission of a key figure, Gerty Farish, the humble friend of Selden who represents what Lily fears becoming herself. Still, various characters appear lacking in context. The book is just too complicated to be turned into a feature film. Despite the fact that certain scenes and dialogue are followed quite literally, a great deal of explanatory material has of course been lost. Along with this blunting of the richness of the book, the cast isn't strong enough, and in some places is disappointing. The lovely look of the film, its very authentic locations and costumes, can't make up for these two huge flaws. Davies said he picked Gillian Anderson because she looked like a Sargent painting and at times she does, but unfortunately she has to act; she's not quite capable of conveying all the nuances of Lily's personality, and besides, is not the dazzling and delicate beauty Wharton clearly describes her as being. At times she looks almost plain. Further, the screenplay fails to convey that Lily was not just unlucky in cards and unwilling to do what was necessary to pay her debts but also a lavish spender on clothes and baubles and enormously spoiled.As the all-important Lawrence Selden, the respectable but not wealthy enough lawyer Lily loves but feels she cannot marry, Eric Stoltz is flabby, a washout. All he's good at is looking smart in his period costumes and wavy red hair, and smoking cigarettes. Selden is far too important a character to be so weak there needs to be strong chemistry between him and Lily and he needs to be compelling and magnetic not vacuous and pretty.For a novel about society, the film is at times badly off on details of manners, which must be conveyed first of all by good casting. Even if this is his finest role to date (Hoberman), Dan Ackroyd is nonetheless inadequate. Gus Tremor is a man of high society who is rich, fat, and boorish. Ackroyd as Gus is adequate only for the fat and boorish part; he doesn't suggest a person to the manor born. One of the embarrassing ironies is that while Sim Rosedale's Jewishness, central to the novel and an aspect of Wharton's own conventional anti-Semitism, is suppressed and converted by vague implication into Italianness with the casting of LaPaglia, an obviously Jewish actress is introduced, in the anti-Semitic climate of this narrative, in the person of Eleanor Bron to play Lily's aunt. That might be justified if the actress were good, but Ms. Brun's performance is a crude caricature. She plays Mrs. Julia Peniston, Lily's Aunt as a wicked witch rather than the disapproving prude of the novel. Something seems off in the conception of Lily's cruel nemesis, Bertha Dorset. Laura Linney, who has the role, is a good actress. But in her key scene she seems more gleefully spiteful than coolly calculating, not an appropriate attitude given the gravity of her own situation. This is a weakness in Davies' direction, surely one of many. He captures the big arc of Lily's decline effectively and there is drama and shock in Lily Bart's rapid decline as dramatized by Ms. Anderson; but do we ever understand it? As on other occasions when wonderful novels have been adapted into films that capture the outlines but miss the core, we can only recommend read the book.

Though many great books have been written, most will forever remain on the shelf and off the screen.  `Siddhartha The Movie,' for instance, will never come into being.The cost of bringing a particular piece of fiction to life is one such consideration.  The amount of dialogue and narration also influence a novel's adaptability.  And, of course, the story's public appeal comes under consideration.  If such guidelines are heeded to strictly, the success of the film lies only in the hands of its director.   If not, movies such as the adaptation of Louis de Bernieres' Corelli's Mandolin come about, in which seventy pages and a few main characters are entirely absent.  It goes without saying that `Captain Corelli's Mandolin' failed as film.  `The House of Mirth' should not have.Edith Wharton's 1905 The House of Mirth has all the makings of a good screenplay.  It is a period piece, and one with a limited number of settings, all of which are described in full detail; it is rich with fast-paced, well-written, subtly emotional dialogue and a limited-omniscient narrator who sees things almost always in chronological order (with a few carefully-placed flashbacks here and there); it is also a piece filled with entertaining dynamic characters and powerful, yet relevant, central themes and conflicts.  A trailer for the film could refer to the story as either `a forbidden romance' or `a young woman's emotional journey.'  And yet, supported by a barrage of marketable possibilities, Terence Davies' 2000 film, `The House of Mirth,' proves to be little more than two hours and twenty minutes of heavily concentrated tedium.  It is, beyond a doubt, far more painful to watch than a balding Nicolas Cage attempting to play a mandolin.The film opens, closes, and does most everything in between, as the novel does.  The problem arises, however, in that apart from plot the movie is entirely independent of Wharton's creation.  The effort which the writer put into the formation of characters, tone and theme seem to have been thoroughly ignored by those responsible for `Mirth.'  This is not an uncommon occurrence, sacrificing character development and even characters in order to fit in the maximum amount of plot.  Even established director Chris Columbus did it in his first `Harry Potter' film, so afraid that audiences would react badly to the absence of a scene that the movie was wildly from setting to setting, sprinkling meaningless dialogue and special effects where needed.  `Mirth,' in this sense, is quite similar to `Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone,' though without giant trolls and magical fight sequences.  And so, without computer-created marvels to add necessary flare to the film, `The House of Mirth' is simply an empty shell and a poor excuse for a movie.The film follows Miss Lily Bart, played monotonously by Gillian Anderson, through her fall from artistocratic prosperity to impoverished disparity. This transition, however, is all but suppressed by Mr. Davies' apparent ineptitude in subtlety.  Lily, as Wharton portrays her, is a beautiful, intelligent, money-hungry `girl,' capable, through an almost superhuman ability to manipulate men, to get whatever she desires from the opposite sex.  Attesting to Wharton's skill, Lily's character is a complex one, and at her deepest layer lies the insecurity one would expect from any other unmarried twenty-nine year-old with no parents and large debts.  Mr. Davies, astoundingly, picks up on this hidden side of Lily and decides to make it a bit less hidden.  The result is the teary-eyed, heavily breathing Lily, which Anderson, armed with her trademark grimace, accurately portrays throughout the film.  This butchering of Bart, while perhaps somewhat helpful to the moviegoer incapable of making personal conclusions, leaves very little room for the change of self that the character must later undergo.This transformation comes as a result of a change in social and economic status, brought on by antagonists Bertha Dorset and Gus Trenor, plays, respectively, by Laura Linney and Dan Akroyd.  In an effort to bring realism into the film, Davies avoided relying on social stereotypes to create his characters.  This, however, was an unfortunate decision since Wharton relied heavily on the method, exaggerating her characters in an almost Dickinsian manner.  The result is a collection of bland, unremarkable characters with the capability to speak only in soft, stilted tones, among which lie the Lily's two adversaries.  Bertha, a cruel, catty adulteress, only appears uncomfortable, not condescending, during her scattered appearances, and is made remarkably likeable by Ms. Linney, who is clearly out of her element. Akroyd, on the other hand, fails to even create a character of Gus with line delivery reminiscent of a high school staging of Shakespeare.  Mr. Akroyd does not do the character, who Wharton portrays as a kind of contemporary Jabba the Hut, justice, having apparently lost the will to play an unflattering character somewhere between `Blues Brothers 2000' and Brittany Spears' `Crossroads.'  Like so many of his fellow SNL cast members, Mr. Akroyd should stay with comedy, or at least at home.Amid this downward spiral of Lily's life and Akroyd's career lies one of the most finely crafted romances contained in Wharton's writings.  It is between Miss Bart and Laurence Seldon (Eric Stoltz) and is filled with passion, pain and social commentary.  It is, in fact, the central story of the piece, beginning in the first chapter and enduring through the changing settings. It is odd, therefore, that Davies chose to downplay it as much as he did. He seemingly brings it up only often enough to keep it in the audience's consciousness, so that he may call upon it again to improve the denouement. Any passion which Wharton envisioned between the two characters is absent completely.  Instead, the relationship becomes the meaningless chatter and sudden kisses of an uncomfortable Anderson and overacting Stoltz.  Seldon, as the actor apparently understood him, is devoid of the charm and insight Wharton awarded him, and is instead a slick haired man with a top hat that speaks too softly and with the vocal inflection of Adam West.  Holy bad actor, Batman; Stoltz showed more emotion as pot-smoking `Bud' in `Fast Times at Ridgemont High' than as the unbearably gentile Laurence Seldon.Anthony LaPaglia, as the foul-turned-friendly Mr. Rosedale, shines as the one and only actor who apparently understood the lines he had to deliver. He shows both greed and compassion beautifully and asserts himself as a strong, versatile actor, despite Davies attempts to reduce his character. However, not even a game of Quidditch could save this movie and, sadly, his energy and depth are forgotten as soon as he leaves a scene.Throughout the film, relationships, events, and even characters are casually mentioned having never been prior introduced.  This is characteristic, however, of a short adaptation of a long book.  It is inexcusable, however, in an almost two-and-a-half hour movie, where time constraints arise only as the result of poor direction and scarce editing.  The deaths of Lily's parents, and with them a much needed explanation of Lily's mindset, could have easily replaced on of the two minute long scenery shots.  At one point, the audience is entreated to the result of a camera's tour of an empty house, with Mozart playing in the background.  Slow pans and slower fades also lead to the slow tone of the film, along with Davies' decision to replace Whitman's clever, fast pace dialogue with scenes comprised entirely of Ms. Anderson's far-off glances and heavy breathing.  The resulting tone contrasts dramatically with the rapidity of most period pieces about high society, such as that which worked so well for Robert Altman's `Gosford Park.'It is a sad fact that the last half-hour of film, when Anderson's acting and such tone and timing are appropriate to Lily's situation, has the semblance of a good film.  It is too little too late and only makes clear what the film could have been the whole time and yet clearly wasn't.  By the end of the film, I was left tired and depressed, though this was entirely independent of the film, or Lily's, ending.  `The House of Mirth,' was, in all truthfulness, the most boring and painful movie I have ever seen.Most films have something, not matter how insignificant, to offer their viewers.  In `Deep Blue Sea,' for example, a movie about a sea lab of good looking people being attacked by giant super-intelligent sharks, Samuel L. Jackson gets eaten.  Unfortunately, `Mirth' is without offerings, and neither Akroyd or Anderson are devoured by fish.At the end of `The House of Mirth,' Terrence Davies credits himself as having `written and directed' the picture.  This byline tells it all. `The House of Mirth' is not based on an Edith Wharton novel.  It is a weak and heartless attempt at a movie and was most likely adapted from Sparknotes.com rather than the original source.  If an adaptation is a reflection of how one person understood a novel, then it is clear the Terrence Davies did not understand The House of Mirth.  Read the book.`The House of Mirth' is rated PG (Parental guidance is suggested for young children) for its lack of adult concepts, such as sex, violence, and character development.

So the costumes and sets are rigorously period. So the manners are, on the surface, correct. This still doesn't work. I know there appear to be a substantial crowd of supporters, but that is perhaps because they, like this film, want to specially plead for self-destructive women to get the break no equally self-destructive man would even be considered for. Lily Bart is obnoxiously self-centered and casually wrecks several lives around her. She puts herself into terrible risk, both with her aunt and with Gus, then expects to be let off. When, as should be the case, there is no release without compensation (repentance and determination to amend herself in the future for her aunt, sleeping with him for Gus), she then begins the long descent because she refuses to bend or consider changing herself.So, this should work, right? It doesn't because this is a fundamentally unsympathetic position and yet the filmmakers insist we sympathize with her. Well, I don't play that game. Either you have her prevented by real and EXTERNAL forces and thus be unable to change, or you focus on her as a willing antisocialite, but not both. It's both for Davies and I turn thumbs down on the effort, if only for that.Besides, of all the actors only Eleanor Bron and Dan Ackroyd have any feel for the actual attitudes and sensibilities of the period. Eric Stoltz would like you to believe he does and Gillian Anderson doesn't even bother. This creates what supporters are calling a 'painterly' version. By that they must really mean 'frozen into a frame', when films like 'Tom Jones' make it clear you can do this and have action too. There's just no heart to this film and, while I don't insist on a eucatastrophe, I do insist on a consistent tone and some kind of progress to finality.Wish I could have gotten that here.

It seemed that this film was trying to create that same atmosphere, but was not entirely successful.  The costumes and sets looked accurate, but I was disappointed in both Gillian Anderson and Eric Stoltz.

In the movie as in the novel, Lily makes a lot of mistakes but in the novel Lily is clearly shown to be a sympathetic and highly moral character brought down by a morally corrupt gilded age that only values surface appearance and outward trappings of money and power.Gillian Anderson gives a brave performance in her role but unfortunately is misdirected and often falls into melodrama. Eric Stolz comes across as a weak one dimensional cardboard figure with none of the critical high-mindedness desperately needed for this role. Dan Akroyd thinks being in a period movie means walking through a scene as if wearing a back brace. Other characters come across as equally flat except for Elizabeth McGovern and Terry Kinney who give creditable performances. As for the director, he was absolutely absent.For a more enjoyable look at Wharton's critique of the Gilded Age, stick with Scorsese's The Age of Innocence.

There was no room at all to enjoy the costumes and sets because the acting was like having to listen to someone dragging their nails down an chalkboard the entire film. Gillian Anderson is abyssmal as Lily Bart and you never see that a spark of intelligence, honor, morality or purity behind her silly facade. Eric Stolz is miscast and his squeeky voice makes him an unconvincing and unsympathetic Lawrence Selden. Watching this on DVD, I was able to learn that poor judgement in editing was what started this movie on the wrong foot, mis-setting the tone of Lily and Lawrence's relationship in Act 1, Scene 1. The viewer is never put into a position to see or understand the superficiality and hypocrisy of the society that Wharton critiques, and never comes to once sympathize with the two lead characters, whose nobility, integrity and morality are supposed to set them apart, draw them together, and then rip them apart again in the sea of deceit. Watching this, you'll want to slap Lily and kill her immediately -- to put yourself out of your misery for having poorly chosen to see this film -- which I must say was not the reaction one is supposed to have to this character, as you know if you've read the book.

She basically goes around whining about life and being pathetic because she can't be part of the snobbish aristocratic lifestyle of the idle rich. Furthermore, its entirely her own fault that she is in her situation. After realizing how desperate she is, she is presented with an opportunity to redeem herself and return to the life of luxury she so desires. Does she do anything about this? NO!

This is literary dialogue, in long, complete sentences, which is the way educated people spoke in those times. Naturalistic readings of it simply do not work.It is the actors' lack of technique that really sinks this project. Besides lacking the voices to read the dialogue with some conviction, they none of them move well in the period costumes, or they gesture in ways that the people of this period would not have. They slump in their chairs, walk with awkward gaits and use their hands inappropriately to the time and place. These people, all upper class educated people, were taught to dance, move, speak well. They were all well-read, especially compared to our times, they spoke and read in languages other than their native American, and they traveled extensively.

Coppola's film featured stereotypical press corps fellatio, including a camera laden idiot played by Dennis Hopper, a besotted Brando, whose intellect was exclusively represented by a still shot of a pile of mostly harmless, liberal books -- in lieu, I suppose, of any exertion at acting on his behalf, but with a hefty purse, nevertheless.At least, I told myself, I will not -- ever -- have to come across anything like it, again. In my life.And then, I viewed this peculiar hybrid of plagiarism and idiocy, and another slice of innocence was burned away.First, let me admit that I have not read House of Mirth, nor have I any intention whatsoever of doing so. What I say here, therefore, has solely to do with this film and nothing to do with Edith Wharton's work, in any sense.I was appalled, if not surprised, by the numbers of the uninformed and unaware who have strenuously worked their keyboards on behalf of this innocuous, but truly execrable, film.Never mind that the acting is -- monotonously and without exception -- wretched, or that Gilliam worshipers, escaped somehow from the fog of the X-Files, have turned out in their unthinkable thousands to publicly smooch this deformed bauble; never mind that Eric Stoltz -- deservedly called brilliant in Mask -- was absolutely clueless in every category of acting skill, in this film.Never mind all of that, which is obvious and not worth discussing, but add this House of Mirth is a condensed, abridged, pamphlet-scale version of Flaubert's masterpiece, Madame Bovary. Emma's best, and most boring, hope for marriage, whom she spurned; her male benefactors demanding the price of her flesh for her debts, her scrambling from one mistreated lover or friend or shop-keeper to another, and finally, to her suicide by poison.This observation cannot possibly be original to me -- but I have not read it anywhere. If no one in the crowd of mainly X-Files viewers bothered to see this film at all, I have no doubt that thousands of literary critics have -- surely -- noted the literary plagiarism, in the instance of this novel. I don't care, personally. I don't enjoy, or even get, Wharton's stuff. Never did.But my indifference to Wharton is not the cause of my outright hostility to The House of Mirth, the film. This film plainly sucks, and it sucks under any possible criterion of acting or film-making that may be applied.Now, my continuing hope for cinematic excellence in the U.S carries two wounds -- one, as I've said, Apocalypse Now; and, two, this sad act of cinematic desperation.

Rather, they were powerful works of art that moved me and made me think.House of Mirth deals with tragic themes, including human society's ability to destroy its own, and the power of hypocrisy and hypocrites.

Hollywood has yet to adapt one of her books in a way that honors this quality.House of Mirth has gorgeous clothing and sets. I didn't care about anybody on screen, though.

Also, as a woman, who, as Lily Bart was meant to, has lived her life by her own code of honor and paid the price for that, I felt that this movie, no less than the Polite Society it depicts so brutally, betrayed Lily Bart.Lily Bart is just a step above a passive masochist in this film. She all but participates in her own destruction. You want, just once, for her to show some initiative, some intelligence, some ability to create her own fate.The film denies her those abilities. In this crippling of Lily Bart, the film seems to hate her as much as polite society does.Movies like Gone with the Wind that depict spunky heroines occasionally winning, and occasionally gaining some power, imo, are much easier to watch.One might argue that such films are not realistic. I don't know. Even we real-life Lily Barts have our resources, and our triumphs.And, again, watching Lily Bart in House of Mirth slowly being eroded on screen was not a feminist experience for me.

My opinion didn't exactly change after watching this movie, but she handled the role better than I anticipated.No, what I disliked most about this film was pretty much everything else the plodding, dull direction that misses every opportunity to invest the story with the vitality and suspense it has in the novel; and the screenplay, which obligatorily hits all the plot points but misses all the nuances and shades of character that Wharton offers. The resulting movie is even drier than the stuffiest Merchant/Ivory project and wouldn't give anyone a sense of what makes the book so powerful. The novel is a page-turner, believe it or not. It's at times unbearably suspenseful--but you wouldn't know it watching this movie.Lily Bart is one of the best heroines ever created in the history of literature, and Anderson, even if better than I thought she would be, simply isn't up to the task of portraying her. Lily should be a life force; there should be something startling and enigmatic about her. Heads should turn when she walks in the room. Anderson's approach is much more waif like. Her Lily is passive, submissive, meek. The scene in which Lily attends the reading of her aunt's will amid a batch of disapproving relatives should come across with the force that Scarlett O'Hara's party entrance wearing a bright red dress has in Gone with the Wind. And the scene in which Lily finally says goodbye to Selden should be heartbreaking, but it doesn't resonate here. Nothing resonates.The House of Mirth would make a terrific movie in the right hands. Just because it's a literary adaptation doesn't mean it needs to be freighted with ponderous pacing and a restrained, embalmed atmosphere.
